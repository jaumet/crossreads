also one from Annie Howard & a few from other friends.  The Cake is excellent & we did enjoy it last night & shall for a few days to come.  The short bread was nice too.  The Ginger is still going strong.  I think I wrote Birthday Greeting to you but if not, I wish you a very, very Happy Birthday, heaps of Luck & present.
Fondest love & kisses to you all.
FromYour loving SisterEdith.
