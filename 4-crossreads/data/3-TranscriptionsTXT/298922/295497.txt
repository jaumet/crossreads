 Saturday 30 June 1917 
 A specimen of a large DESERT snake was killed in a subalterns blankets this morning &ndash; they are shinier than the Australian snake &amp; more stumpy tailed &ndash; some poisonous. Big guns going all this morning &ndash; we have a job on MONDAY. 
 Just heard that the S.S. Mongolia has been sunk near Bombay with our letters home so probably you will miss my notes for a few weeks. 
 I believe DR. NORMAN Robertson &amp; his wife were on board, but have not heard the Casualties yet. I hope they may be safe.
