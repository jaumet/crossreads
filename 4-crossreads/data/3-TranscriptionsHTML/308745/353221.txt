<p>Elocution</p>
<p>The Flower of Youth<br/>1<br/>Lest heaven be for the greybeard's hoary<br/>God who made boys for his delight<br/>Goes on earth's hour of grief and glory<br/>And calls the boys in from the night<br/>When they come trooping from the War<br/>Our skies have many a new gold star.<br/>2<br/>Heavens thronged with gay and careless faces<br/>New waked from dreams of dreadful things<br/>They walk by green and pleasant places<br/>And by the Crystal water springs<br/>Forget the nightmare field of slain</p>
