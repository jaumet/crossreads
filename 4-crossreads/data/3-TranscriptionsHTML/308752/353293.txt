<p>are lying all over the deck in a pitiable condition. Being in such comfortable quarters is one of the reasons why I am not sick. We have already nine out of our eighteen men very sick, &amp; this is only after two days on board. Went on ward duty from 2 p.m. till 10 a.m. most of the patients are already cured, the Matron keep them full of mirth, &amp; &amp; they say that laughing is a splendid cure for any sickness. I am called the Matron.</p>
<p>13th November.<br/>Woke up with a splitting headache it lasted all the morning thought I was in for sea sickness but luckily by dinner time I felt quite well again. Voyage is getting very monotonous, I believe there will be no ports of call until we reach Suez.<br/>When one thinks of this, it is really a wonderful achievement, here are 1400 odd men on board who will probably be travelling for 30 days, everything goes off smoothly &amp; we receive our three meals a day, there must be an enormous lot of stores etc&ndash; on board. Nothing startling happened to day.</p>
<p>14th November.<br/>Rise at 6 a.m. to find that Roberts &amp; I are Ward Orderlies in the hospital on the 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. shift for a week. I am very glad it will break the monotony. Plenty of work to do, we have 20 patients in our ward. I started my work well by going round</p>
