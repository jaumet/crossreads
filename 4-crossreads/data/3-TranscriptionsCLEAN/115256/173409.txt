 Dec. 12 months to-day since we left Australia - and ye Gods! what a twelve months!  It seems like 12 years since we sailed from Port Melbourne hoping, as at least 90% of us hoped, to be back within six months.  What a string of events since that memorable day!  Xmas '14 at sea on a troopship - the tropics - Egypt - the subtle charm of the East then the weary desert marches - preparations for the great Adventure - culminating in the meeting of the M.E.F. [Mediterranean Expeditionary Force] at Mudros. - April 25th - back in Egypt again, invalided - August 6th - Lemnos - Durrants Post again, & finally the Evacuation. 
 And here we are at Lemnos again.  Great have been our feats of arms - but with what military, political, economic or diplomatic victories?  Certainly we have kept a huge Turkish Army occupied together with German & Austrian artillery and that's about all.  Politically Gallipoli spells Mud & Failure with a capital M & F
