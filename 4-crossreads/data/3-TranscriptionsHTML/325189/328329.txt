<p>has been growing colder now for several days and can expect another fall of 12 points yet.  After this it grows warm for a little while round Aden then cool &amp; then hot at our destination.  This morning at reveille the island of Socotra was just visible upon the port side.</p>
<p>2nd March 1915 Tuesday</p>
<p>Sighted Arabia at 11.0 a.m.  Skirted the coast which is very hilly and entered the Aden harbour at 8 p.m.  It was dark and we saw nothing of the town.  The pilot came aboard but left after a few minutes taking the mail</p>
