Div. officers & to have these over 1st Div. men breeds a feeling of resentment & rebellion, for one & all down to the latest reinforcement considers himself superior to any 3rd Division therefore we all work against one another as much as possible.  I should not be surprised to see a riot here any day for these 3rd Div. people are detested, we are a funny lot us "Aussies".Got a letter from home addressed to Mr Duke yesterday, they come much quicker that way alright than through the military.This evening Lindsay & I went down to the pictures at Sutton Veney for the last night of a big 2 week picture was being shown, "Protea" was the name & it was very good indeed.
