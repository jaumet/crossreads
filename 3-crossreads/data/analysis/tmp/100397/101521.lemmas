 one of my letter that I had been told that the Chaplain Capt McKenzi had been kill , it was not true . I got quit a surpris when I saw him here . I tri to find out about Simmon and one man told me he was kill . I was not satisfi and ask a second , and he told me that he was allright and had been transfer to the Transport . I also made Inquiri through the Base but never heard from them . When I rejoin I found Sim . go strong and he ask me to thank you for the Xmas Wish which he receiv . he intend to write but I fanci felt a trifl shi . The parcel have never arriv but they may later on . The one that Mrs. Barker sent came along in Januari , and was open by the boy . They enjoy it . I am glad that it got through safe . The weather has been cold , but not unbear so . I daresay that when the wet weather start , if we are in the line , I will feel it a lot more . at present it might be wors . How long we stay out here I dont know and where we go from here I dont know . I ve no doubt that it will be to some nice live part of the line but that doe n't matter .
