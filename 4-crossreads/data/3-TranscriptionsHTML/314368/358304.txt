<p>At the trial this morning 5 men were discharged , so I suppose after dinner we will have to drum them out in ceremony. I suppose Mr. Rowe has departed before this, he didn't do too badly considering all those bad friends he had in the district. I don't think there is any chance of my getting off this week end either, as extra pickets have to be kept for a few days after every pay, and this time the men were worse than before so no leave is to be granted. Of course there are only a couple of dozen defaulters but they are a rough lot and might make a riot at any time.</p>
<p>I got my pay all right yesterday &pound;4.10. so I will be all right now. I will have to buy a few things when I get out, but they wont amount to much<strike> if you could manage it Ida, I would like you to send me along </strike> I was going to say that shirt that Rosie left me, but don't bother as I will get one in town tomorrow, dad will want all at home. You might send along a few tomatoes if you like they will reach me all right</p>

<p>No more news now, so I will close, Hoping you are all well at home with fond love your loving Bro Gordon</p>
