Turned out to be Bermuda which is made up of numerous islands very close together. Hove to off the island about a mile. It is rather a pretty place, it is a very fashionable watering place for the Americans of the North during the winter. It is owned by Great Britain & it is a delightful climate especially about this time of the year. During New York's winter season the people who can, come here to escape the cold. The houses are mostly  white. Of course none were allowed ashore. We could not get any particulars about the place. This was the rendezvous for us to pick up with a British Convoy which we did. The H.M.S. Carnarvon taking us in charge & Uncle Sam took leave of us about 2 pm. We remained hove till 5pm. being delayed by the Ruahine's steaming gear out of order which had to be adjusted here. Left Bermuda 5.10 pm heading still north for Halifax which we reach in a day or two
