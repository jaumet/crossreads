<p>Friday 18 January<br/>Weather dull.<br/>A walk to Neuve Eglise &amp; look over the ruins.  The place has been much knocked about since June '16 but is not shelled much now, since Messines Ridge is in British hands.</p>
<p>Saturday 19 January<br/>This morning a balloon at Neuve Eglise broke away from its moorings &amp; floated away over the Bosche lines.  The observors came out in parachutes, &amp; our anti aircraft guns tried by very rotten shooting to destroy the sausage in vain. Weather cloudy.  Heavy bombardment on the right.</p>
