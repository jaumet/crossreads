" And , he continu , with a light laugh , " She believ that I still read it , and that I still pray " He was then "go the pace " 1 Your last fond gift to me Ah , then you littl knew ( As in your hand you held The volum old , and gave it to me then , with mani prayer That I?d be true ) Nor dream , such faith was thine That scarc would the leav Be turn , by hand of mine . 2 Neglect was your gift , For long , asid it lay While , you , dear heart believ The inspir page , to be to me A sourc of joy and strength A lambent Ray Of light from God 's own Throne And so you pray , and thought my prayer Were mingl with your own . 3 And so with measur pace The day roll swift by And each with tale of broken vow To tell , and deeper peer in To sin dark way Till God , on High Seem veri far away And judgment stir no fear And love was stark and gray .
