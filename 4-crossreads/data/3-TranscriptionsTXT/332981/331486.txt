Great French Air Attack
Panic among Germans
Several bombing operations were carried out. One hundred and forty eight, bombing planes in successive groups protected by Battle planes numbering 120 in all, took part in there expeditions. Our bombers were thus enabled to drop 39 1/2 tons of bombs and use several dozen rounds of machine gun ammunition under the most favourable circumstances, causing panic among the enemy's troops and dispersing the columns and convoys with heavy loss.
