<p>In afternoon went to Sports which were held in a hollow the hills around giving good position to view sports which were very good. Something very interesting was on pretty continuously. The heads were in the hurdle jumping which was good one lady jumper being present.</p>
<p>Aeroplanes were all over the place. At one time when I thought of counting them I counted 10 in the air. One alighted close to the sports after flying close to the ground for some time and there was a rush to look at it. It was a double seater and I got a good look in both seats &amp; at the engine. While looking in pilots seat the <strike>pilot</strike> chaps came along, got in &amp; flew off. I had a great view. After flying low for some time they went up higher and looped the loop twice just above the sports &amp; comparatively only low down. The sports were very good, so I had a good afternoon.</p>
<p>Evening I had a walk &amp; returned early</p>
<p>Sunday 1/10/16<br/>Owing to stables taking a long time we were too late for church parade. Spent morning reading walking &amp; watching buck jumping on some of our rebels. By the way we had an extra hour's sleep last night owing to the clock being put back at 3 am to 2 a.m. Walked to Durrington &amp; had a rest at the local Church Soldiers tent &amp; got back to camp in time for tea.</p>
<p>Visited Y.M.C.A. No. 2 in evening where a sacred concert was held Very excellent program was rendered a Miss Prendegast being encored 3 times for violin solos. This artist celebrates her 100 visit to Salisbury next Wednesday week This is a rather fine performance as she comes from Bristol &amp; once during the winter was carried on a stretcher</p>
