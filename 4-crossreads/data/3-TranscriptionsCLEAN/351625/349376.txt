Dear Mum,
I think it is time I dropped you another note.  I have been here nearly four weeks now but will be going on leave Tuesday 5 Nov. provided if I don't get the flu in the meantime, it is raging all over the country just at present so one never knows whether he is going to escape or not.  I am not particular myself if I get it as it means staying here
