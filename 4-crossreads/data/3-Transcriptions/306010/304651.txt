These shelters can be recognised by a green flag flying above the "dug out" &amp; a small notice "abri public" (public shelter) posted up beside it.<br/>Tuesday 29" Aug. (5 p.m):<br/>Ever since arriving in France I have regularly obtained the French daily papers.

Parts of the two first-mentioned Departments are in German possession &amp; from the T&eacute;l&eacute;gramme one</p>
