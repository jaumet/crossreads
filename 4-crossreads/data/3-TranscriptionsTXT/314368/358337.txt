 France The Trenches 10.10.16 
 Dear Dad, As I have not yet posted a letter written to you on the 6th, I am sending this note along with it, to say that since then we have moved up to the front line. I am still feeling quite O.K. and see no reason why I should not always keep so for although things are not too comfortable they could be far worse. This part of the line is fairly quiet just now, but it does not say it will keep that way. I am pleased to say that I have at last declared war on the Hun, and have spent a few hours pumping out the iron rations over the parapet. I was sorry to see in an old paper where one of the young Glawsons had died at home, both of the brothers, Tom and Jim and the two Blyghtons as well, are here. Hoping that all are well at home when this reaches you with fond love Your loving Son Gordon
