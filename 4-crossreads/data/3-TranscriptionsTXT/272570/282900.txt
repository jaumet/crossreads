The dentist had a big lot &amp; I was there till 4p.m. Went back through Amiens &ndash; hopped on to a motor lorry, &amp; then walked to Rivery from Amiens. The fine big city is as silent as a tomb &ndash; all the buildings are closed up, no civilians are to be seen in the streets, military policemen are the only human beings about. Most of the windows are shattered &amp; some big buildings ruined by the Huns' bombing &amp; shelling. I saw a notice on a street saying British soldiers found looting will be shot. Lor' knows how these French towns will ever be rebuilt. The war news is very good lately, &amp; Fritz is getting pie on the Marne. I am still feeling rather queer. Sunday 4 Aug.4th anniversary of the war today; the old padre of the 14th Bn. Held a service of the nucleus of the Brigade in morning. i got a little A.M.C. bloke to take my temperature tonight, it was 101.4. I ought to go on sick parade, but they don't do anything for you if you do, so I'll stick it. 5 Aug. Raining again. I went up to Rivery
After tea to get a "Daily Mail". The soldiers were swarming round the Froggy newsboy like a favourite at Randwick, all eager to read the war news, as those in it know less of how the war is going than those over in England who read the cables each day. I tramped  to 3 canteens trying to get something to  eat, but they were all shut. 6 Aug.I struck an escort job, had to take a "bird" from the clink in Rivery to Bn. Headq'rs, had a private with me. The coots expected us to walk the 8 kilos to La Neuville evidently &ndash; it's a lovely army &ndash; but we managed to strike a Tommy motor lorry  &amp; later an Aussie G.S. wagon, that took us part of the way. On arriving at La Neuville, we were disgusted to find we had to take him on to Vaire-S-Corbie, &amp; we tramped on in the rain &amp; slush through Corbie &amp; Hamelet, to Vaire &amp; Bn. Headq'rs. Am blowed if the nucleus haven't to come into the line again for a big stunt, so that's my spell out &ndash; tramp back again to get my gear &amp; then up here. Had some bread &amp; jam at 4 p.m., first bite since breakfast, but vomited it all up again. Started back to Rivery about 6.30, walked through
