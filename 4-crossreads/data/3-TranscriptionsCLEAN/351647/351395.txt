  
 ho.  Oh she was naughty.  I read about the theatres.  I'd love to see Blanny getting tight in "Fair & Warmer".  I told you about "Maid of the Mountains" in London.  I'd like you to see "Chu chin chow" its so gorgeously eastern & the dresses are wonderful & weird.  One girl had an absolutely transparent dress on.  Tut Tut.  I'm not at all nice this mail.  Reaction from a strenuous & strainy week.  My bosom pals are down for a day or two safe & sound thank Heaven & I'm living at the old Battery with all the old crowd.  We're hoping to go out for a little rest soon so I'm polishing up my French again.
