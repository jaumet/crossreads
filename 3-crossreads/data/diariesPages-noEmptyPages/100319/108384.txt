29/9/18 Marquaix
Dawn was heralded by an intense bombardment which dwindled off into the sustained rattle of rumble of the heavies later in the morning. A fine clear day. The bivouacs turn out to be not so bad after all ? dug in to little banks and sunken hedges round a hillside. Many of the men slept on the grass and pulled their trench shelters over themselves their blankets. General Robertson was round and said the Americans succeeded in their attack this morning after a little trouble on the left. A very large gun of ours is firing from the railway near Marquaix this morning. A few big shells came to hand from Fritz occasionally. Took a walk up on to the high ground near the camp and got a good birdseye view of the countryside. On the horizon was smoke of shell bursts.
