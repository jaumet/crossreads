<p>2.  It was fine to be the first to take him out to the Pyramids &amp; though Rid &amp; I had seen them before we all enjoyed them together.  More than once we could not help remarking then, &amp; Rid &amp; I have done since, how glad you would be to know we had been together at any rate so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an hour's tram ride out to the Pyramids from Cairo but it is through intensely interesting scenery &amp; is not tiresome.  We were a little late in starting out for them because we went to the Bank &amp; one or two other places we wanted to give Wal directions to, and you will think it was rather late for afternoon tea when I tell you it was after 7 o'clock when we sat down.  It did not spoil our dinner though so it was all right.  It was such a pity we couldn't have had Le too.  I had a very nice letter from him re-addressed from Alexandria &amp; though it is not headed so, I gather he is down at Tel-el-Keber.  He is going to come up to Alex. to see me early in March if we cannot arrange anything before, I am sure I shall hug him when I see him wherever it is.<br/>We tried to arrange to go out with Wal the following day or Saturday but received a note next morning from him by his orderly to say that he would be close at it till Monday night &amp; no chance of seeing him till Tuesday at the earliest, that is to-morrow.<br/>On Friday I had a most exhilarating day, my letters that I had asked to be re-addressed here came, and there were 19.  It was fine to have heard about you from Wal the day before, &amp; then to have your letters the next day.  Thank you both so much for the lovely long separate letters you wrote, I had two from you Mother, I do so love getting them but I don't want you to weary your dear selves you have so little time &amp; so many letters to write.</p>
