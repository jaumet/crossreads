Thank you for returning CLARRIE DANIELS diaries they are very beautiful.  Last night an exciting AIR FIGHT occurred just outside our Trenches. The HUNS chased 2 of our machines & brought one down. Then like a Hawk circled over us [the following crossed through to the end of the page] while I let loose 1400 rounds & never scratched him. An Aviator was burnt a bit but not killed. Oh the machine was presented by Commercial Travellers of N.S.W. but the HUN has too much speed & their flying men are certainly game. Letters from England the wife is enjoying herself in London rather a spoilt Child I am afraid. Am back into SHORTS again for the summer legs show very white for a start.
