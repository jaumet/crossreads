14/11/18 YzeuxA frosty morning but fine. With Jackson I inspected the Signal School and gave them a speech about interest in work etc. At 10.15 left on horseback with Bazeley and others for the Foret de Vignacourt and a Divn. Horse Show. Acted as a judge there in different horse events. General Blamey was down from Corps and brought no news. The Transport turnout was good. The 22nd winning the watercart and the packs and securing third in the cooker. My chestnut did no good in hacks or races. Six nurses from Abbeville formed an agreeable distraction. During afternoon some wild boars were chased out of the forest and rushed across the field.  Darkness closed a fine sunny day early but the chill of winter soon gets a grip on after 3 pm.
