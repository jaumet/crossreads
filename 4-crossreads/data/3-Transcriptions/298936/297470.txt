<p>November,1915</p>
<p>Friday 12</p>
<p>Artillery Rd. station.</p>
<p>Bomb came over &amp; burst on top of 6th Field Amb. dressing station up the road towards Lone Pine &amp; killed  &amp; injured a half dozen.</p>
<p>One case of sickness for us in the night.</p>
<p>Mail in but so far no letters for me.</p>
<p>This jaundice has a most depressing effect on one.</p>
<p>Wonder how I'll ever stick it till the war finishes, but <strike>that</strike> feeling will pass with the sickness.</p>
