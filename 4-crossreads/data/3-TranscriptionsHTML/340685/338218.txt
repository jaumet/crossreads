<p>During the whole time our complete casualties were 42 including Lt Higginbottom. Shell shock &amp; Williams sniped just over the heart while studying a map with a torch. Higginbottom frankly funked it all but must have been upset by one shell which went pretty close I believe. McNamara &amp; Tonkin went to Vignacourt for supplie4s and had a good time. The Scotch Camerons are billeted there.<br/>2.8.16  Nothing important happened and stayed in all day. Still resting.<br/>3.8.16 Usual.<br/>4.8.16 This morning at 6.30 we were told the following were to be our future parade hours. Reveille 6. Parade physical exercises 6.30 to 7. Breakfast 7 to 8 Parade 8 to 12 generally route march. Parade 2-4 and another  9-10 P.M. pretty stiff although not so bad as we don't take it seriously. Physical was a farce and consisted of a march up and down for about 19 mins then we were dismissed. However Dowling &amp; McKay took us for a route march 8 to 11.30 to Havernas and a long way round. Very dusty but didn't hurt us much. 2-4 we tied knots and this evening we didn't go out till 9.30 when all we did was to layout a tape and stand by it the whole operation lasting about 15 minutes and is supposed  to guard against confusion when we dig future communication trenches. We work 2 paces apart if there are sufficient of us. The to bed and a sound sleep feeling pretty tired.<br/>5.8.16 Farce of physical exercises and at 8 o'clock I didn't go out as another route march was on and my boots are nearly done for so I was put on ostensibly cleaning the camp but have done writing this diary up all the time to dinner and am now right up to date in everything. No afternoon parade so as I wasn't feeling quite up to scratch had a good sleep to tea time and after tea went into town and purchased a new pipe chocolat and soap. No evening parade so got to bed about 9 and rumours of us leaving next day Sunday &ndash; Our usual moving day.<br/>Omission &ndash; 21.7.16 A funny thing happened in the afternoon. One man of each bay acts as sentry and keeps a look out and to-day as it was rather dangerous looking over the top the sentry used a mirror periscope. All went well for about 10 minutes when the germans evidently discovered the  mirror flashing in the sun as they didn't keep it steady enough. We quickly got about a dozen <strike>ex</strike> high explosives dropped right where we were and then apparently satisfied they slackened off. No one fortunately was hurt and needless to say that dodge wasn't tried again.</p>
