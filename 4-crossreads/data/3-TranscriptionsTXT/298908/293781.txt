At any rate the shock of meeting over she came home to the Winters home &amp; there we had tea &amp; a girl or two dropping in we had a musical evening.  Theres no one knows only those who have had to spend years in Kahki what a pleasure it is to get in touch with people like this.  Why it is a little bit of heaven &amp; it seems just like a dream needless to say I enjoyed myself &amp; after it was all over we had supper &amp; then Eva &amp; I walked down to the train with Mrs. Oliver &amp; saw her off, &amp; on getting back found Vera waiting with the table set for more supper so we 3 set to work &amp;amp made merry &amp; then after a pleasant evening to bed.  I like these girls very much, they are real decent &amp; a pleasure to mix with.
