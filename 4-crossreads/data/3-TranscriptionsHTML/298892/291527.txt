<p>A.M.C.<br/>33rd Battalion,<br/>Field  Hospital,<br/>Rutherford Camp.<br/>West Maitland.<br/>9th. April 1916.</p>
<p>Dear Father and Mother/.<br/>Mumps and Measles are still raging amongst the Battalion. The number of Measles admissions has considerably diminished but Mumps are as strong as ever. Rumour says that the Battalion is to sail in May but under the circumstances I fail to see how the men can get away.<br/>I have applied to accompany the Battalion but  have, as yet, received no notification of my request having been granted. Captn. Rosenthal, the Medical Officer appointed to accompany the Battalion is very anxious that myself and a fellow Orderly F.D. Clarke should go with him but he is too slow to have our appointment confirmed.<br/>I received mother's two last letters, one enclosing a photo of Kevin, during the week.<br/>I intend applying for special leave this week</p>
