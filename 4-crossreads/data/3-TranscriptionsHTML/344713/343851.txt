<p>Left Liverpool Camp<br/>This morning &amp; embarked on the "Runic" at Wooloomooloo  &amp;<br/>did not get outside of  Harbour &amp; away till the afternoon.</p>
<p>Wed. 11th.<br/>Outside of Port Phillip but the ship only slowed down to drop mail &amp; the Staff Sergeant Majors on to a pilot skimmer &amp; now we are "well &amp; truly" off to "we don't know where". No calling at Adelaide, Albany or Freemantle, but believe Aden to be our first stop.</p>
