<p>My dear Father,</p>
<p>Yesterday I told you I hadn't yet received all the parcels.  Now I have.  As it happened the razor blades turned out to be the most needed.  I don't know how you think of all these things.  Generally I don't know I want them myself until they arrive.</p>
<p>I don't remember if I told you how unfortunate I was with some pay last week.  When I came to total up the sheets I found that my credit balance was &pound;37-12-9 short.  It really serves me right, &amp; will make me more careful in the future.  The only thing that surprises me is that instead of &pound;37 I didn't loose &pound;120.  Still I have not been extravagant &amp; so am not left short.</p>
<p>As news papers are not very plentiful here I have no news to give you, so will close.  Give my love to Mother &amp; the rest of the household.</p>
<p>Your affectionate son,<br/>Arthur</p>
