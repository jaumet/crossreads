 Thou Lovest Thou may st vain , idl seek feebl word to speak ; meek , humbl there silent hour of prayer If uncount wealth were thine ? the rich of the mine ? a gift so dear impart love heart . It shall droop wane ere long the pleasur ? love throng ; prayer for her shall murmur be , a fervent prayer for the Becom a path of pain , like these thi spirit shall sustain ; invad , nor poverti impair , at the holi time of prayer .
