A final rehearsal of our drill took place in the morning before the Adjutant & the Major of our T.B. & we then set to & polished ourselves up for the afternoon.
After dinner we march 4 miles to meet the gun carriage & coffin & then accompanied it to the Church in Durrington to the tune & time of the "Dead March in Saul" and also Chopin's "March Funebre" both of which were rendered in grand style by our full Battalion Band, and it takes a band to give the full spirit to these grand marches. Our party in all consisted of the band, led by the drum-major with his huge silver mounted baton, officers, & about 200 men as mourners.
The service at the Durrington Church was short & impressive especially because of the old hymns which we sung, viz "Rock of Ages"
