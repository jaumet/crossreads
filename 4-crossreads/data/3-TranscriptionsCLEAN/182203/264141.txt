  
 had a real happy time. We each had a most beautiful box of sweets at our place at the table. Mine I like better than the others. It was a pretty sight. Could not wear my best Mess-dress (not allowed) but had a clean dress (a pretty grey cotton-crepe) with my best cape, best cap &  little  silk  stockings & shoes & clean apron. Our men thought we looked charming. You'll say I'm spoilt & shall not want to be home again but oh, I do get  Mummie  sick at times. No place like  Home   Hope you all had a Happy Day & that the New Year will be full of joy  & happiness for you all.  Fondest love.
