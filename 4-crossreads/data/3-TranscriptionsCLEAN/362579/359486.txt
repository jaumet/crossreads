  
 I'm having the day-off. So meeting her at Paddington   &  we go out together then, to Highgate. 
 My lunch was in this week in the way of parcels. 
 A cake from Mrs Baynes family arrived on Monday. It was a beauty - we finished it last night. How very good of them remembering me, especially now. We cannot buy any decent cakes - no fruit or sugar allowed to be used on luxuries. such a lovely sweet one too. 
 Yesterday a nice little present from Bessie came. A cake of soap   &  a slip bodice
