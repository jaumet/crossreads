very long.  I am very well getting quite fat & eating so well.  I like the job its so interesting but I wish the war would finish & we could go home.  It is quite cold already.  I saw Brian & Bert Macnamara they are well & hearty & send their love. Their stars haven't changed them & I don't think will.  Letter writing is a precarious job, orderlies keep dodging in & I have very little time to myself.  I haven't had any letters from you lately.  I sent you a Blighty with a lovely front page.  I hope you get it.  I thought of Graham when I saw it.  Now I must close.  I hope You'll forgive this scrappy note.  I'll write as soon as I can.  Love to the Boss & Mac & Graham & all yourself from,
Yours as ever,Wilkie.
