<p>a touch of the blues the last day or two &amp; been feeling very sleepy &amp; in no humor for work; measles are quite the rage at present &amp; there is quite a number of lads in hospital with them.  The food had not been kept up to us too well during the last week &amp; I have to buy a good deal of jam at 4 PT (10d) per tin.  These Egyptians rob us hand over fist.  The pump in working order again &amp; were able to water the horses at the trough again to night</p>
<p>Wed 27  Received some letters &amp; papers from home late last night.  one each from Geo. Meg, Jess</p>
