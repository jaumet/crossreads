8.6.15Tue. 8th.  Last night another charge was made from Quinns Post.  I believe 27 of our men were wounded, 9 killed.  An alarm was given about midnight that that the Turks were advancing on our left, but it proved a false alarm, heavy firing was maintained all night & Johnny Hailstone was shot dead, having the top of his head blown away;  he belonged to B Troop & like Paddy Moloy was a reinforcement.  'Tis strange but it appears that the best men among us are the ones that get killed.  I cannot find out any particulars concerning the attack last night but so I suppose it was a failure.  Came off duty at 12 & argued about farming, politics etc. with Penny & Howarth until it was time to turn in at dusk (8 oclock).
