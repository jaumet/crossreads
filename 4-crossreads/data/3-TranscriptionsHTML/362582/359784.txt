<p>My dear old Jane, So delighted to receive two letters from home last Saturday, one from Al, Dec 7th &amp; the other from you Dec. 13th &ndash; they are both nice newsy letters. So glad the birthdays were a great success &amp; that you all liked the presents I sent. Hope Xmas was a happy time for you all. I told you in the previous letter how I spent Xmas &amp; new Year. This year so far has flown &amp; the days are not nearly long enough &amp; my strength not strong enough to do half what I wish to. Anyhow, it is better the time should go swiftly than hang heavily on ones life. I have been going out a good deal lately. I seem to get a number of invitation &amp; this climate makes one very restless, such a number of interesting places to go to &amp; the weather is beautiful now, one cannot settle down to write.</p>
