Wednesday next
26th June:- MondayTo-day is not so hot  A few of us at least have plenty of work (I &  Legge, far too much in comparison)  There seems to be a further delay in departure  - to-day we hear of several drastic changes amongst our headquarters in London re being sent out to rejoin their old units. How pleasant a prospect for us. It will suit me however, so long as I get to England first  Shall be quite satisfied to go to the front then  As a matter of fact, this is what I have sought all along.
To-day at 1 pm 101  . To-night at 9 pm 91  & at 10-30 pm 89    Much cooler
