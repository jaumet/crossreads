<p>what to night will bring forth, one can only surmise by the quietness of to day like yesterday that we are in for a repetition of last nights business I sincerely hope not as my nerves are getting jumpy under this terrible shell fire. This morning I was thoroughly unnerved &amp; fit for nothing as were all of us. Am the only one in the Police left now two new men to report today<br/>Pay 15/1 &pound;25.10.0.<br/>We lost a lot of men last night &amp; so did Fritz when he tried to come over in massed formn. our Artillery was waiting for him so you can guess the rest. The German dead are heaped up in front of our lines<br/>came over in waves.</p>
<p>Wednesday 16/5/17<br/>The huns have run or evacuated or retired one of these &amp; the result a good nights rest free from horror &amp; no one wanted it more than I did hardly closed my eyes for, (at night time) a week. A few shells came over last night &amp; smashed up some more of the smashed village &amp; now he is gone back to another strong ridge  at Cambrai five miles, but we'll hunt him out of that also.<br/>Pay 16/1 &pound;25.11.0.<br/>The Posi I was going to sleep in last night, but changed my mind about 6 PM, had a huge wall blown down during the evening. Reported since that fritz has not gone back so far, if at all still the Tommies went over this morning &amp; found he had left their sector. Pretty quiet again today Percy Peacie had about 20 wounds small ones &amp; the Corporal Birch had his throat</p>
