Tuesday 13 1916At midnight all had to stand to & soon after the artillery started to breach the enemy parapet. Raiders went out & we afterwards heard that they took 6 prisoners & a machine gun & only had 2 of their men wounded. Our trenches were shelled & I did not enjoy my first taste of it, altho' we received no casualties. Was on was from "Stand down" (3 a.m.) until 7, & after breakfast tried with but little success to get some sleep.On in the afternoon until 9 p.m. & then turned in until "Stand to" at 2 a.m. Capt. Cotton away in Sailly : Lt. Hunter killed by sniper abt. 4 a.m. A most miserable wet day with short breaks only when rain was not falling : worse than ever underfoot. Very little artillery "straffing" during the day, a few shrapnel shells only being burst over our communication & some St.E.s used in searching for a concealed gun behind us.
