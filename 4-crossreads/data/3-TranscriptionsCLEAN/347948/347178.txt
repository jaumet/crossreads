 Night is gone and day is breaking Sunbeams gently kiss the dew Mingling the green with diamonds Shining in their verdant hue In the midst there stands a lily Proudly in its purity Ah, its virtue, sweet as heaven Just like you dear, seem to me. 
 Here comes Carmichael's band Here comes Carmichael's band Oh just listen to their merry tune They've got a ripping lead And now they only need A girl or two to appreciate their view With Sergeant Flynn in front Im sure you'd have to hunt For any band that springs to it as well And if some Friday night You see a lovely sight Of 30 couples sitting far away from the light Bet that it's Carmichael's Band
