<p>Tuesday11 March 1919<br/>Port Said<br/>As Smallpox broke out at Villa Montrose, I had to get Dolly, Babe &amp; self vacinated.  Further difficulties arose owing to riots.  The leading Nationalists were deported to Malta so the Natives broke windows &amp; cracked a few soldiers on the head, broke Trams up etc., paralizing Business.  I had difficulty in getting a car thro' the crowds at the Station, 2 Natives were shot.  Then all Baggage that I had sent Suez I had to get back to Port Said by Passenger train - I have taken now on board S.S. Ulimaroa to relieve Dolly.  All my purchases were hung up &amp; travelling is terrifically hard work, no one should attempt to travel for 1 year.</p>
