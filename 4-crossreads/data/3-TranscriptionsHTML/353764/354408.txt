<p>accident occurred near us to-day &amp; it was this.<br/>A party of officers &amp; N.C.O.S were being instructed in Bomb throwing from one of the trenches here.<br/>The Warrant Officer &amp; SMajor fitted the Bomb to the thrower &amp; were instructing on it, and then went to fire it as a demonstration, when something went wrong &amp; the Bomb exploded.<br/>4 officers were very badly wounded &amp; the W.O. &amp; C.S.M were killed.<br/>The former had his head almost blown off &amp; the latter was practically disembowelled.<br/>It cast a gloom over the whole Hospital (No1) when they were brought in.<br/>I was up there visiting Uncle Charlie when they were brought in &amp; he was one of the Drs who attended them.<br/>There is still some fighting at Matruah [Matrah] &amp; it is gradually assuming larger proportions.<br/> There are many things going on there which the people will never know.<br/>For instance as our Troops advance into the Senussi Villages the women folk cut their childrens throats &amp; then kill themselves.</p>
