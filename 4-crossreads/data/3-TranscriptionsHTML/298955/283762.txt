<p>3&ndash; E deM<br/>night of the 25th  About 6.30 pm I was in my hammock dozing when we heard an awful explosion and felt a dreadful concussion &amp; you could imagine you could hear the iron plates of the ship being torn apart it was fearfully realistic, every body thought we had been struck by a torpedo &amp; of course there was a stampede for the boats. By the time I had got out of my hammock there was not a soul left below but myself. Whilst making up my mind what to do another roar and concussion occurred and I naturally thought we had got another torpedo into us,&amp; I was just making up my mind to make for the boat I had been allotted to, when to my great surprise and delight I heard them returning singing out it was one of the guns that had been fired. By jove[?] some of the fellows got a terrible shock &amp; small wonder. As for myself strange to say I did not experience the slightest feeling of fear &amp; was taking things quite calmly but all the same was more than delighted it was nothing serious as we have a number of cot and helpless cases on board</p>
