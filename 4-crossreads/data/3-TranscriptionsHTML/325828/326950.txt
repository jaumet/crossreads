<p>France&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 21.8.16<br/>28th June 1916.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>The Austln. Mail closes again tomorrow, &amp; I am glad, very glad that you won't have to wait for a month this time before hearing from France as I was thinking you would when I last wrote.<br/>I had a surprise visit from Wal this afternoon   It was only a brief visit as he was pretty busy.  He had come up from the line &amp; I was very thankful to see him safe &amp; sound.  I told him I was writing home tonight &amp; he said to let you know he was in splendid health &amp; keeping well.  He has been kept very busy with his work &amp; unable to write as fully as possible<br/>It is raining again tonight &amp; the weather here lately is just about ideal for ducks etc. rain mud, &amp; slush, &amp; then for a change slush, mud &amp; rain, week in week out.  I suppose it is a soldier's privilege to growl though.  It isn't a bad sign when the weather is the only thing a man can find to growl at though.</p>
