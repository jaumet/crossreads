<p>Thursday 23rd<br/>Nothing much done; bayonet fighting getting more interesting now, also some bombing practise done. Expect to get leave tomorrow.</p>
<p>Friday 24th<br/>Told late last night that our leave was granted.</p>
<p>Started off at 8 am for train, over 750 men altogether. Long and slow trip up with nothing of any importance on journey. Passed through some pretty country and saw Eton College and the rowing course.</p>
