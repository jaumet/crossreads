 I was expecting to be able to give you my change of address by this time, but things are still very unsettled & it is quite on the cards that I may have to go back to the 1st Division. The General commanding the Artillery of the 1st Division says he must have more of his original officers & has ordered the return of 2 other subalterns & myself while Colonel Rosenthal commanding this Divn refuses to let us go so the matter is in abeyance. I am still acting Adjutant of the 11th Brigade and if I remain will in all probability get my Captaincy, whereas if I am recalled it will be as a Subaltern. There is a conference
