<p>3/2/18<br/>Left Plymouth at 12 noon on the Balmoral Castle for home. Our Convoy consisted of the "Morea" as escort with 12 destroyers. The Argylleshire Euripides with troops. The Ionic with soldiers' wives. The Khyber &amp; a Holt boat completed the fleet.</p>
<p>15/2/18<br/>Arrived at Sierra Leone (Freetown) at 7 oclock this morning,  after rather a pleasant trip from Plymouth. Its terribly hot here, though Freetown looks a decent sort of town.</p>
