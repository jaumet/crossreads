  
 best wishes for a speedy recovery. We left the ship at 3.15 and were on board the train by 3.30 We left Southampton about 4.30 and reached Exeter by 9. p.m. where we stayed for more than half an hour. Here we were met by the citizens and treated with extraordinary kindness. They gave us fresh grapes, apples & sliced [indecipherable] apples cake and cigarettes. We did full justice to all the good things. Here many of the patients were taken off voluntary workers doing the 
 stretcher bearing. We then left for Devonport arriving at Plymouth North Road station about 12. o'clock & from there we went by motor car to the hospital which had formerly been a large public school. We reached it before 1.am.
