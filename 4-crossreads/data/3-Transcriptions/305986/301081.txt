<p>one chap fired 10 shots at me, the tenth one got me, in the side and out the back, I didnt swear either but I could walk so It did not matter walked down to the dressing station at Basentin and am now waiting to go away to the Casualty clearing station it will do me, though he could have hit me harder if he liked I wont get much of a spell out of this lot but she only missed the heart by 2 inches so I suppose I shouldnt</p>
