<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>I see by a cable I just received that Keith has sailed.  Was he sorry he had to go with a cycle corps?  He has nothing to be sorry about, &amp; what is more you will have no reason to worry.  I was afraid the day would come when he would have to leave, but now my mind is quite at ease about him;  sometimes I almost envy him.  I hope I <strike>have</strike> will have the opportunity of seeing him when he reaches here, but of course that is very doubtful.</p>
<p>How is uncle progressing?  Here we see nothing all day but aeroplanes being shelled, &amp; seeing the narrow escapes they have, it seems almost incredible that anything should happen to a harmless,</p>
