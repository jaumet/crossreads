<p>Apr; 4<br/>Easter Sunday.  We are kept in camp , as the Cairenes have a Fete Day on; if "the boys" got amongst them there would be trouble.</p>
<p>Apr; 5<br/>To-day in camp has been like hell &ndash; great gusts of wind which blow the sand into the eyes, the nose, the throat; almost suffocating &ndash; sand, sand , sand everywhere.

<p>Apr; 6<br/>Soon we shall be upon the battlefield &ndash; I pray God that I shall not be wanting when we are under fire.</p>
<p>Apr; 7<br/>Drill &ndash; visit Cairo</p>
