<p>April 1918<br/>him &amp; altho the odds (300-30) were heavy his casualties were heavier. He came in waves &amp; got mown down in waves. On 11th he started shelling with 4.2 guns, the Wadi Anja &amp; tried to get some of our batty's but beyond killing a few mules &amp; wnding one man slightly &amp; getting a cook in the leg &amp; arm no damage done. We shifted a few yds in Wadi Obedia where protection better. 60 pdrs very much in evidence. Good Austn mail recd on 10th &amp; letters from David Joe on 13th. Dave coming to Egypt next draft &amp; Joes 10m off coast in France. Letters to Dad Mater &amp; Molly written &amp; others rec'd from them 3 long years &amp; 7 long months today since I enlisted. Jordan crossed on March 24th &amp; recrossed again on April 1st or 2nd.<br/>May 30th. Back in Wadi Hanin. <br/>April &amp; may 1918<br/>After shifting from Wadi Anja to Wadi OBeida (cause by enemy shelling) we struck a very dusty camp L.H. &amp; transport repeatedly passing &amp; raising clouds of dust. About April 28, we again shifted, this time across the wadi into a patch of tees besides some old ruins. Jacko made several air raids while we were here flying overhead &amp; very low each time. An A.A. brought up to meet him first morning when a dozen of his planes came over &amp; the following morning about six came over &amp; the anti played up &amp; broke their formation. Third morning when four came over, one of his planes evidently got it. It turned round, dropped his load quietly &amp; without attempting to go further, cleared for home, apparently hit. First indication of a raid to me was the antis shells</p>
