<p>Trench Warfare.<br/>Don't confuse Trench warfare with warfare in the open.  18 men to the yard are required to make an attack on a trench.</p>
<p>Artillery attacks are followed up by the Infantry.</p>
<p>The Infantry has strict orders as to how far they are to advance.</p>
<p>In the defence of a Trench the men must know the plan of the trench thoroughly so as to be able to find their way about and concentrate at any part they are ordered to defend.  If they did not know the trench well they might get lost and unable to go where required, thus the trench might be taken by the enemy.</p>
