Wednesday 14 November 1917Reported Matron's office 8.30 a.m.  Dusted, did th. dressings for sterilizing, washed fly traps.  C. Collins came in & smiling as usual, asked what I was doing & Matron told him I had taken to beer.Marton [Matron] speaks to me in the nicest way possible.  "What did you say child," & are you feeling really better, & means it too.  Sent me off duty 3.30 p.m. & need not go back unless convoy comes in.  No convoy so creep to bed feeling very weak after "gippi" & take a dose of oil & pray for strength again.  When will it come back I wonder?
