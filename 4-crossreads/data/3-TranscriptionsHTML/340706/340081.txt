<p>&amp; another for my orderly.</p>
<p>On arriving in camp I find that I am in time to see mens breakfast &amp; then have my own. After breakfast there is a medical inspection &amp; then as day is wet parade dismisses.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I write up diary &amp; letters. Went to Courmontagne &amp; talked with a Peronne girl &amp; then coffee</p>
<p>27-4-19 (Sun)<br/>Seeing the slackness that is prevailing at the camp I have decided to take advantage of it &amp; stay in my new quarter all day.</p>
<p>Last night after my yarn with the girl who was compelled to work at the point of the bayonet by the Germans during 2 years I yarned with the ladies who keep this house They are 3 sisters 46 42 &amp; 41 but carry their age well</p>
<p>We chat on &amp; I tell them I intend to sleep in on the morrow. Consequently they send coffee up to me at 7.30 pm &amp; then ask if I should like breakfast in bed which they send up to me. So in spite of the fact that I laid in provisions last night at the cost of 5 fr it was quite needless.</p>
<p>After enormous trouble I manage to get up at midday &amp; then having received a delayed Australian mail</p>
