  
 attendance on a youngster who had strained herself pumping water, and had a pain in the stomach. After going through the usual medical pantomime of taking her temperature and pulse and looking very knowing after observing the result therof I gave her some of the well known army remedies No.9 pills which certainly shift everything in the stomach and should remove the pain as well. I don't think she will come for any further treatment. 
 Scarcely had I finished with the youngster than another old crony arrived to ask if we would come and see an old lady who "beaucoup malade". The sergeant and I went and interviewed the old lady who was in bed and she certainly looked very old and feeble. She is sixty two years of age and is suffering from bronchitis. We advised them to call in the french civilian doctor as we considered the case was a bit beyond us, but as he is a tottering old man I doubt if he will  be of much assistance. I think she would pull round alright but she seems to be worrying a good deal and hasn't much desire to recover. As the inhabitants speak a patois of their own the little french we know is  not of much assistance in understanding them. The military doctors are not supposed to attend the civil population. The cold is not so intense here now and occasionally we get quite a bright sunny day. I just received a long letter from both father and mother and also Field Service card from Stirl complaining of not hearing from me. I also received two Lismore papers. The present war news leads me to hope that we won't have to weather another french winter.
