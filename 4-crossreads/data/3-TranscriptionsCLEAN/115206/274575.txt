At BeutinRepeated yesterday's operation and ride, had my tooth pulled by a very capable Staff Sergt in the dental corps attached to A.A.M.C. The frost again hardened the roads, and they are indeed in a very treacherous state for uncogged horses. Our little village is still our home; and the Estaminet [indecipherable] an rendezvous. He the boys gather to played billiards, sit by the fire, and drink coffee, or vin Rouge. Both excellent drinks on cold days.
