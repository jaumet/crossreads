They paid the S. Australians & Tasmanians this morning & they are paying the rest this afternoon, at the present time gambling is in full swing.
10th.  We are having a bonza time on our old boat nothing to do all day long & practically no duties, even with what little work that has to be done some of the boys are not playing the game though.  The Adjutant gave us a little lecture on the subject told them how it was the C.O.s intention to give them as little as was possible to do, but when they were detailed for a duty they should carry it out & not slink away & leave a few to finish the job like some of them have been doing he said if they did not put a stop to this they would have to take steps to put catch the offenders & punish them & no one wants anything like this to occur for we want to go home without a crime for the trip.
