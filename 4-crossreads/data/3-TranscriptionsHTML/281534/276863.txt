<p>4/3/19 Marcinelle<br/>Showery day. At 10 am Capt Denny M.C. a onetime Attorney General of South Australia gave an address on Repatriation in the Cercle Catholique. Afternoon I walked down to the 6 F Ambulance dentist and had some teeth stopped and then went back past Jack's billet where he is still in bed and only slowly recovering from influenza. Went up the Charleroi streets &ndash; not many troops were in today as the <strike>street</strike> town is temporarily out of bounds. Spent the evening with Dr Daniel and met several families.</p>
<p>5/3/19<br/>A fine springlike day. Worried little Sir John Hobbs called in the morning and in the afternoon I walked to a football match at Mont sur Marcienne from where is got a fine view of Charleroi</p>
