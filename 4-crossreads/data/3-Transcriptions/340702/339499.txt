<p>[Transcriber's notes: In the period covered by this dairy Cleary was stationed mostly around Amiens.  Cleary saw little or no front line action but was often in danger particularly from bombs dropped by aeroplanes.  He writes well and provides insight into the views of those in support of men in the front line.  For example he tells of the Chinese labourers, French civilians then the final German advance in 1918 with their apparent air superiority and the refugees.  This pessimism changes when the Allies start their last offensive and Cleary describes the tanks going up to the front line and the numerous prisoners being escorted back through the lines.  He also relates some good stories and anecdotes and one in particular which contradicts the often espoused assertion by the RSL that there were no gays in the Australian army.  Unfortunately his diary ends on 28 August 1918 so he does not describe the end of the war and his return to Australia in July 1919. He mentions letters written to Mac. This was his wife's pet name, her maiden name being (Mary) McMahon]</p>
