 Dear Old Bill. 
 We had a lovly time on Wattle-day we where going to write to you on the first of this month because it was Wattle-day Frank and I din't go to school on Wattle-day because Mum wanted to take us to the welcome to Mr. Parit he is going preach tomorrow at Church he is going to be a Catechist.  We all thought that it was a holiday and it was not so we had to go to school which I don't like neither does Frank. 
 4.8.18. Now it is Sunday and Mother says that we had to go to Sunday school but if it rains we can't go to Sunday school.  I might go to  Sunday  Church to day but I don't know.  My Wattle is lovly on the trees and on Frank's to.  And Oh we have such nice times and the shelf on the fire it looks nice and so does the fire.  Both of us slept with Mum last night it was my turn to sleep with mum.  I am soon count up how many words and then end off because I can't  (end off)  think of anythink.  I have 198 words. xxx Much love from Ruth xxx etc. xxx etc. And for when you come Home
