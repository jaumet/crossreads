 Sydney-Emden Engagement 9th November, 1914 
 Report of Surgeon L. Darby, R.A.N. 
 H.M.A.S. Sydney 
 Sir, 
 I have the honor to submit a report on the action with S.M.S. Emden on 9th Nov. 1914 off Cocos Island. 
 At 7.30 a.m. I heard the rumour that a strange war ship was at the entrance to Cocos Island, 50 miles distant.  Soon this was confirmed, and though we had had many false alarms previously, I went to the sick bay and gave instructions to S.B.S. Mullins to get everything below and prepare for action. 
 The stations for the surgical party are the fore & after ammunition lobbies for the stretcher bearers with their stretchers, and two theatres, one for each surgeon and his assistants, are prepared in well separated stokers' bathrooms which are situated in the tube running up the centre of the ship.  The bathrooms are 10 ft. by 8 ft. by 7 ft. in size, and are supplied with hot water & cold water, also they contain lockers in which dressings can be stowed.  Though not quite below the water-line they are well protected - above by two decks, and on the sides by armour and by coal bunkers.  One of these bathrooms I have appropriated, and it is permanently rigged up as a theatre, with operating table, instruments, and dressings stored there for immediate use. 
 Unfortunately, only two days before the action I had everything taken up to the sick bay,
