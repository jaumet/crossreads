  
 later, as soon as we had dinner today we marched out onto the parade ground & the roll was called we then took our packs off & all the billets & ground was properly cleaned up before we went, I saw Graham & Flattley this morning in Outersteene they both belong to the Pioneer Battalion There was an issue of green envelope's & Field card's on the parade ground this morning & not before they were wanted All the members of the our band are now back with the Company, all our instruments have been sent to Salisbury Plains in England that's a pretty good sign This morning all the N.C. O's were issued with a pair of wire cutters, & a lot of the men with bags to carry bombs in sounds nice do'snt it, but the sooner its over the better
