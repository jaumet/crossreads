 June, 1917. Tuesday 19 Usual parades. Spent morning collecting pontoon equipment until colonel told us we were like helpless ants and took charge to our disgust. Swimming parade in aftn &amp; after got a paper &amp; read various things. In evening went for a swim with Berkett, Macmillan, Phillips and learnt something of the art. Heavy thunderstorms several times came up.
