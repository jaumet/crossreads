dogs they are going home so they thought too, but they were sadly mistaken for he told their Instructors to march them away & give them some physical jerks, so they took them away & started the mob racing one against the other, of course they were enthusiastic you could see that from the way they were carrying on, after a while the officer gets sick of watching them & he takes  a walk, down to try and liven them up but he got very poor results, we were all expecting to see him counted out & it's a wonder he was not, for the lads naturally were in a very bad humour, & I don't blame them it's a poor policy punishing the mob for the sake of one or two, if ever an officer was called pretty names well this chap was.
