<p>9 February 1918 Saturday<br/>Still raining &amp; snow on the Hills  just heard WADI GHUZZI washed Railway Line away again so rations &amp; horsefeed will be scarcer.<br/>Oranges are now issued in lieu of vegetables.<br/>The horse Lines get ankle deep in mud &amp; we've not had a decent wash for days-<br/>Rum issue every night.  Boils under both arms &amp; Skin trouble little better, only trifles, but not pleasant in the wet soldiering.</p>
