They all take snuff, some smoke. This afternoon went Jerusalem to Pilates House & Zion Sisters, whence our Lord started up the Via Dolorosa, then I went once more to the Pools of Bethsaida, & on to Garden of Gethsemane & to the Tomb of the Virgin Mary.X Many parties of soldiers with Padres in charge w h ere going around-   I have been lucky in seeing all these places.
