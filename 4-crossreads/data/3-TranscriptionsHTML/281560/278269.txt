<p>7/7/16.<br/>Route Marches are the order of the day here, I suspect that they are getting us set for a long march somewhere. Had a foot inspection and a bath (I needed the bath) this afternoon. Met Sergt Major Jack Moore, and Sgt Chisholm today. There are cherry trees loaded with fruit here and I pay them considerable attention.<br/>8/7/16.<br/>Had another good bath today. There are three things a man looks forward to here; a bath, a pay, and a good night's sleep. Our Company Commander Captain Harris; (we call him "Digby") warns us to be ready for the road tomorrow. "Digby" is a god old sport, he buys us beer, plum puddings,and other comforts. A sure road to the hearts of the troops.</p>
