This morning all N.C.O.s & any privates who wished to fell in & had to do one hours duty they are supposed to be learning how to salute by numbers  Etc. & hardly know whether to take it as a joke or not & object .A telephone line is being erected from the Railway Station to this camp; We have an interpreter with us, an Egyptian he joined us 3 or 4 days ago. Old mail has been turning up here very constant but it is all for lads who have been wounded or left us sick Cpt. Bigg was sent to Minia today with a poisoned arm; We are living well at present plenty of bread & fresh tender meat.
