<p>December 25, 26<br/>50.<br/>Mail, "Songs Before Sunrise" and a charming little edit. also T.L.S. and letter from Mrs. Hadley.</p>
<p>December 26<br/>51.<br/>Last night's dinner the most successful and enjoyed of a year's dinners, a full swinging success and a goodly company.  A starting at 4.30 and an ending at 8, then down to D.R.S. and a challenge snow fight with the officers, A. Section alone remaining in the field, vanquishing all comers.</p>
<p>Today the snow heavy on the ground, and a full sun shining.  We look out from the D. Room over a low valley.  Yesterday in the afternoon when only a thin layer of snow had fallen, the scene was of soft pale apple green and the veiled pink of red roof tiles, today it's a scene from the primitives, farm houses and trees grouped as fine tapestries and open spaces of pure gleaming white, lovely in the sun.</p>
<p>Today dressings, all sprained ankles, black eyes and bruises.</p>
<p>December 27<br/>52.<br/>Pater's "Renaissance" and Swinburne's "Songs before Sunrise", jove what loveliness of writings.</p>
<p>53.<br/>Twenty of A. Bearers up, Blue H. up where Francis should have gone.  F. at first rather attracted me &ndash; a masculine Daisy Jerome Type in build and colouring, but his personality and manner not too prepossessing.</p>
<p>54.<br/>Decided upon, if the Paying O. will stand it, a drawing of 80 F. this coming pay &ndash; to get Dowson's "Decorations in Prose and Verse", 1899, 30/-, the 1st edition of the cover design of gold, probably by Ricketts or Shannon.</p>
<p>Another cold grey day, and a long morning of dressings.  The Tommies have at last discovered us, and they arrive with all the ills of the Military world.</p>
<p>55.<br/>Write tonight to Export Manager, T.B.C., to procure Dowson's "Decorations" and Beerbohm's "More".  And to Gerald, and to Harold N., replying to R. letter of last Oct. or early November.</p>
