<p>&amp; "united we stand &ndash; divided we fall" the essence of unionism?  Then why not vote yes &amp; thus preserve the unity of the British Empire &amp; support the tens of thousands of unionists now fighting in the trenches.<br/>We must <strike>not forget either</strike> remember too that this Conscription is not for all time.  We have the absolute promise of the Government that the day the war ends is also the day Conscription ends.  Also we must not forget that a great many men will be exempt from this compulsory service &ndash; our primary industries will not be forgotten, men will be spared to carry on the necessary industries.  Only sons will not be required to go, although they may volunteer &amp; thus do their bit for their country.  Boys under 21 will not be made to go.  Sole supports of aged parents or dependents &ndash; in fact any man who really should not go may appeal to a local tribunal &amp; if his excuse is a good one he will be exempted.</p>
