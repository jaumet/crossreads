<p>Front line, Delville Wood, Longueval 4/11/16 Our destination proved to be a long earthy trench innocent of any revetting..Hopping in the first thing trod on was a dead man.  Found the CO in a wretched dugout and no other accommodation so went back with the padre and the Adjutant of the battn. we relieved.  It was now quite dark and the shell bursts lit the whole scene in front as with fairy lights.  Through the plucking mud we trudged nearly dead beat and after many a fall and slip we reached Delville Wood again..  Some men gave us some biscuits which tasted good.  The issue is softer than what we were used to at Gallipoli.  Dozens of signal wires used &amp; disused underfoot everywhere.  After great toll we reached the outskirts of Longueval and after much rambling located our people and found them in tents they had pinched.  The padre and I turned in.  The floor of our tent was a carpet of mud inches deep and we had no blanket or any covering whatsoever.  Buttoning up our waterproofs we lay down in the mud with our steel helmets for pillows. The wet bit right through and nearly froze us to the bone.  One very heavy rainstorm made us fear for the tent but it remained standing.  About 12 Fritz put over some shells.</p>
<p>5/11/16 Awoke stiff with the cold and had just got outside the tent when it collapsed on me and all my gear.  Sent  Hunt back to the QM. to get coats etc.  Very heavy guns back here started a bombardment about 9.15 am.  A filthy rotten life with awful mud.  Went up to Divisional Headquarters in the morning and saw Norman who said General Paton wounded and Col. Fitzgerald also. The men here made themselves fairly comfortable by digging their tents in and making all fast.  No water supply and we replenish our cookers from the water in shell holes.  Wet after dark.  Several bombardments and Huns put up many red flares.  Lively flashes tearing across wild sky and got us belching out "Lord what fools we mortals be"; [F.O?] turned up at 10.30 pm having been blocked on the road for 6 hours and only got his rations delivered up the line by 5am.  6/11/16</p>
