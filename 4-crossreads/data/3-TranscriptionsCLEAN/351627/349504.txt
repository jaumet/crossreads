  
 at present. 
 We go in the surf every day & swim our horses also, I think the horses enjoy it just as much as we do 
 I have only had one letter from Artie since he returned but I suppose there is an excuse for him now that he is married 
 I am pleased to hear that Charleie has been discharged, the first wound he got was severe enough & ought to have been sufficient without looking for more, am sorry his arm is so bad I hope it will improve as time goes on. 
 Well Aunty I cannot think of anything else that I may write about. Hoping you are all well 
 I remain Your affectionate nephew Norman Sherwin
