 Aug.   19.  St. Omer attracted us to-day.   It being Sunday, I expected to hear the Cathedral organ in the evening, &amp; for this reason particularly I visited the place.   The day was perfect, &amp; in the afternoon the N.Z. Military Band played some selections in the park.   Towards tea-time my inoculation made itself felt &amp; I had to clear back to billet as quickly as possible, procuring a few pills from Willie Vane on the way. 
 Aug.  20.   I went on sick parade this morning and had the day off &amp; passed the time reading "Under the Red Robe" by S. Waymen.   It is an historical romance of the early 17th Cen. &amp; gives a glimpse of France under Richelieu's strong hand.   The tale is a good one, and the plot is poetically just. 
 Aug.  21.   Wood stunts &amp; drill to-day.   I turned into bed early &amp; had a read by candlelight before going to sleep.
