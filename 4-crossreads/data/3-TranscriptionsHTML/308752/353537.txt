<p>gave Eric &amp; I such a good time whilst we were camped at Albert Park, Melbourne. This week has been full of surprises.  The following day, Arthur Butler, our worthy postman proceeded on leave to England, &amp; I have taken his job on whilst he is away.  It is interesting work &ndash; every morning I go by motor ambulance to ----- for the mail. My first day on this job was a busy one for me.   I brought back a fair sized mail from N.S.W.   About  25 letters, greeted me &amp; I got sick &amp; tired of reading about the M.M. Too much fuss was made over the event, you can just put it down to good luck. Tis better to be born lucky than rich.   As I have told you all on numerous occasions that its the <u>Infantry who deserve all the praise &amp; honour</u> in this terrible struggle.   "I raise my hat to these men every time". The Blighty Leave has suddenly got a spurt on lately &amp; a good number have gone on Leave from our Unit.   So don't be surprised if you hear of me visiting the old country again. Don't think for one moment, that I am undergoing any hardships lately, for the last three months I have lived fairly comfortable &amp; had an easy time of it.   Its the monotony of this life that gets a chap down.  Do you wonder at it?.</p>
