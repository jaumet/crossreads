<p>(21)<br/>the training now consisted only of loading and unloading stores and route marching, But we got a disagreeable surprise when on Sat 11 Nov 16 the afternoon found us marching round and round those ancient stones of Stonehenge practising ambulance foot drill in sections, and the same preparation on Sun 12th Nov in preparation for Mon 13th when we took our place in a try-out divisional route march of 18 miles through Winterbourne-Stoke and Shrewton home again.  Up till this day I had been spending my spare moments worrying the quartermaster store for my equipment. During this route march I carried all my belongings in the pack on my back. I rather enjoyed the march but was not game to say so that day.<br/>18th Nov 16<br/>By this time we had been pretty well equipped with equipment, clothing, leatherjerkins, gas masks, identity discs iron rations, field dressings etc etc ready for the front.</p>
<p>Our next experience was rather a pleasant one except for the two days of extreme cold preceding it &ndash; a snowstorm</p>
<p>(22)<br/>We had great fun snow balling building snowmen etc but the fall only lasted a day and left a thickness of three or four inches. Consequently it soon thawed and the result was real slush. About this time everyone was very busy letter writing and packing his luggage to put in his kitbag to be stored by headquarters London or to send to a friend or to take with him in  his "pack" or valise in which case it must be according to a certain list.</p>
<p>I wrote to all at home and sent my personal belongings and camera to a friend in London &ndash; Mrs Milligan.  During the last week in camp 3 Lark Hill, Salisbury Plains, I made many trips into Salisbury to obtain some photos of myself, which however failed to obtain and they had to be sent home direct, and I heard later were much liked by the homefolk. During the last few days is was a work of art to reach the city as no leave could be granted anywhere.</p>
