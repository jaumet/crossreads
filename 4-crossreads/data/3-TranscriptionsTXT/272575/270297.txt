however after awhile we managed to get some Roast Beef and boiled beans.   This morning we got Porridge stew and Bread & margarine for Brek at Dinner, Roast Mutton, Potatoes & Cabbage   Most of the men are pretty right again but some of them are feeling very downhearted yet I am feeling allright and pretty hungry.   so far I have not felt ill and at present the sea is comparatively smooth,  we are now somewhere off the Victorian coast and expect to pass Melbourne early tomorrow morning.   I dont think we call at Melbourne   I had a good sleep last night the first for some time, the last 3 or 4 nights in camp I was never in bed much before 1 am.   we have a mixed crowd aboard.   Artillery, Engers Remounts. A. & C.  A.M.C. and [indecipherable] about 1400 alltogether,   I suppose we will call at freemantle but dont know how long we will stay there.   Thursday night things were only middling in camp when I got to camp
