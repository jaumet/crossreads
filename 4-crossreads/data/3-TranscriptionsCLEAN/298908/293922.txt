  
 without having something to love, that at any rate is my own opinion of such things & I for one am strongly against this world wide disarmament that some politicians talk so glibly of, no doubt Germany made a fine nation of her peoples but unfortunately she used it to a bad purpose.  I am not one of these canting one-sided bitter predjuiced snoozers who reckon that a German should not be allowed to live after this.  I reckon in one way she has done the world taking things all round a jolly good turn, there's one thing she united the British Empire more closely than ever would have been the case otherwise, & much as I deplore the awful loss of life & suffering, I believe fully that such things have to be & they will come in some shape or form, & there's no need for all the blame to go on the side like we are trying to put things we were not altogether blameless in this great war.
