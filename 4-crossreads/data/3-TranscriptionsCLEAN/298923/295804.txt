You remember the song "I know a Bank whereon the Wild Thyme grows" well it is all around our present camp- also Sage & Maiden-hair fern, quite a treat after the Jordan Valley & if all goes well, we rest here for a month, if Jacko will let us? X Still fighting the 50/-/- "bill" for stolen troughs etc. & I don't think I'll have to pay it now. Am very fit & no trace of Bronchitis only skin trouble, I already thanked you for Ligmolene 2 pots. Bad news from France!!X Wood is the great trouble again- I bought 2 Camel loads of Charcoal at 2/-/-
