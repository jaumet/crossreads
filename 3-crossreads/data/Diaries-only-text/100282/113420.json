service they are a flash lot, I can see some rows when the 4th get among them this will be the ruination of the Australian Force for it is going to destroy all "esprit de corps" this is a great thing in an Army also all promotions will be knocked in the head for all Battalions will be overrun with N.C.O.s officers, nice state of affairs, I feel sorry for the 4th 5th Div.
We had a visit this evening from the Royal Warwickshire Fife Drum Band by Jove they were something lovely to listen to a bit different to most of the rag time bands we hear, they must have been playing together ever since war broke out for they were almost perfect especially the side drummers, the whole show were well turned out looked fine. We (the Sgts) have 7 fowls for tomorrows dinner paid 13/4 per pair for them only ordinary fowls at that, we plucked them this evening our cooks are going to fix them up for us tomorrow.
