<p>The Better Land</p>
<p>1.  I hear thee speak of a better land<br/>Thou call'st its children a happy band<br/>Mother where is that radiant shore?<br/>(Shall we not seek it) &amp; weep no more<br/>Is it where the flower of the orange blows<br/>And the fireflies dance through the myrtle boughs<br/>Not there: not there: my child.</p>
<p>2.  Is it far away in some region old<br/>Where rivers wander o'er sands of gold<br/>Where the burning rays of the ruby shine<br/>And (the diamond lights up) the secret mine<br/>Is it there sweet mother that better land<br/>Not there: not there: my child</p>
<p>3.  Eye hath not seen it, my gentle boy<br/>Ear hath not heard its deep songs of joy<br/>Dreams cannot picture a world so fair<br/>(Sorrow or death) may not enter there<br/>Time doth not breathe (on its fadeless bloom)<br/>Far (beyond the clouds) (Far beyond the tomb)<br/>Far beyond the clouods &ndash; beyond the tomb<br/>It is there, It is there My child it is there<br/>Tis there</p>
