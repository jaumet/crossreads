 letter of the end of July and beginning of August, from which I am very pleased to note you have got over your bad spell and were keeping well.  You had a very cold snap there too, but now you will be over that and into the warmer weather.  I hope you are looking after yourself O.K.  I am glad to note you are going about and enjoying yourself, too.  It pleases me to hear that Dad is well and bogging in as usual, besides Bess & Lock.  Bess' exertions in the recruiting line will be about at an end now.  I'm O.K. 
 I suppost the butter shortage will be over now.  I tasted the first bit of butter since I've been back on leave, a few days ago.  It's about 5/- a lb over here, and eggs are about 8d each. 
 Well, we're back in a feather-bed again and it is greatly appreciated, for it's refreshening up very much.  We've had a fair amount of rain too, which puts the camp underfoot mud.  It is not as big a place as we were in rest last year, but it looks as if it will not be necessary to go up
