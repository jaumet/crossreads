Dear Vol
I got your note and papers re election & will do all I know for you tho' opportunities are not very frequent.  However, I think & certainly hope you'll do the heck this time.  There's no doubt that the Hughes mob isn't the thing, in fact, I think that theirs is a very fair sample of dirty politics.  Yes, I voted NO not from your influence or anyone elses but because I know.  My old man tells me he voted Yes because by so doing he is sure to get me a spell home.  What blithering rot.  Anyway Hughes' scheme has come the proverbial gutzer (to which it was pre-doomed) and after all the old hands are getting home for a spell.
I got a letter from George who has by now joined his unit.  I should like to see him and will do my best to look
