<p>Somewhere in Belgium this time.<br/>16 September</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>I only wish I could write to you when I felt like it but somehow or other I never can, always something important <strike>to be</strike> doing or to be done, when we're in I'm going like made &amp; when we're out I'm still going, clearing &amp; squaring up things.  Consequently the only time I get to myself &amp; my pleasures is very late at night and say what you like without whisky or champagne I'm not at my best at night.  <strike>light</strike></p>
<p>Excuse mistakes &amp; corrections but this is a rowdy old place.  Gawd knows how many people all round &amp; all yapping &amp; the place has as many echoes as a cave.  However perhaps it will get quieter later meantime I'll struggle along.</p>
<p>I got a letter from you tonight, No. 24 so I dunno where 22 &amp; 23 have got to, I suppose they'll arrive later.  I'm sorry you were peeved.  One does get that way &amp; Nerida although a dear soul doesn't vary her methods &amp; at</p>
