<p>Friday 20 July 1917.</p>
<p>Reveille 7 a.m. Another good sleep in. Still no duties for those inoculated.</p>
<p>At 1 pm left this area with others on leave to Ismailia 1 pm to 9.30 pm. It was Christmas Day in this country. Queer &amp; quaint sights were to be seen. Had conversation with Indian troops, one a Sgt Redigul 58 Rifles V.C. hero. Took a snap of them in Rue Negrelli. Returned to camp at 8.30 pm.</p>
<p>Got 9 letters by mail that had been given out while on leave. Read them over hurriedly before &quot;lights out&quot;. Cpl. Brennan 4th A.L.H. 7th Regt. had called to see me about George Kelley.</p>
<p>The European population came out of doors towards evening in Ismailia.</p>
