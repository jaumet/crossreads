<p>Dear girl</p>
<p>It's Monday morning &ndash; 9  - 30 am   -  &amp; we'v heard the big guns firing 'down the bay'  -  The Melbourne went out yesterday &amp; we heard there was likely to be a scrap outside  -  Firing went on at intervals for &frac34; of an hour &amp; then ceased  -  Well &ndash; I shall tell later about this  -  What I'm after now is to tell you of our star turn yesterday &ndash; two of us at any rate <strike>up &amp; down</strike> &amp; one of the 2 was me  -  Our first time on the beach  - About noon a general order <strike>or notice</strike> came out &ndash; Flag ship of course  -  It was to the effect that the British flag would be hoisted &amp; saluted at 3 pm over the island of <strike>New</strike> Britain  -  A declaration of annexation read  -  A parade wd be held at 2. 50 pm &amp; then came details of dress  -  Swords to be worn  -  Service helmets &amp; the usual white rig out  -  The Submarine chaps &amp; our officers had no rig out &amp; so couldn't comply  -  No more could I but I meant to be there somehow  -  After lunch I found out that our Captain had borrowed a helmet &amp; a bally sword &amp; meant to turn up so I went &amp; spoke [indecipherable]  -  He referred me to Besant &amp; I promptly went &amp; asked <strike>got</strike> leave to go  -  Got it all right &amp; then rigged myself up in my new serge suit</p>
