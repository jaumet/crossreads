<p>Wednesday 15 September, 1915</p>
<p>Slight shower of rain during the night made everything sloppy &amp; uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Had to go off sick today just a touch of dysentery, I hope to be well again tomorrow.</p>
<p>They are putting a fourth man in our happy home, it will be a bit crowded.</p>
<p>Have been put on a rice diet. Wrote home &amp; to Jessie Chisholm, Tom, Mrs Parsih &amp; Phyliss today.</p>
<p>Have been pretty crook &amp; off duty, had a good nights sleep.</p>
