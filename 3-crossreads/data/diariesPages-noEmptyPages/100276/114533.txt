Well this is the end of another small diary making me 5 in all I must try get these 3 home safely somehow, for they are much better than letters are absolutely true in every respect, neither being exaggerated nor understated but plain unvarnished facts of my life every days doings what we see going on around us from day to day, if this book gives anyone as much pleasure reading it as I have had writing it well it will be time well spent on my part.
