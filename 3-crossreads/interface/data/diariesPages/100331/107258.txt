we had 40 Trucks on board heavily loaded after a couple of delays enroute we arrived at St Jean at 17 oclock, We could only get our Train half way in at the Station as every road was nearly full up, This Station is a new place is Situated about 1 mile past Epres Canal on an incline has 6 roads sets of Rails laid down to at present they are still adding to the number of Roads, the ground is very soft takes a lot of Ballast to make a good bed for the Rails. After splitting the Train into 3 sections I eventually got the Train in clear of the main line, There were 3 Labour Company's waiting on Trucks, one behind the other to get away to their respective Camps, once the line was clear they were soon on their way. All around the station is Dug Outs Camps occupied by Troops things are humming in all directions mingling
