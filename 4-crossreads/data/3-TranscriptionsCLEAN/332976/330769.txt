  
 December 1916 & it is a risky job mending them.  Since the Australians have been on this sector, this place is generally known as Lone Pine.) 18th   I am corporal of the guard to-day & had a very narrow squeak about midnight.  One of Fritz's shells landed within two yds. of the guard tent, but luckily no damage was done- not even a piece hit the tent. 19th   I am Orderly Corporal today & have had a very quiet day.  It has been extremely cold & has been snowing since about 3 P.M.  We have had very cold weather for days & the ground has been continually frozen hard.
