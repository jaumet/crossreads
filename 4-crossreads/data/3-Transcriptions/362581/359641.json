<p>My darling Eddy,</p>
<p>your letters are lovely   &amp;  you are becoming quite clever with your writing   &amp;  printing  also drawing. I suppose you will have begin schooling by the time you get this card. I do hope you will like it   &amp;  be happy with your little schoolmates. We are very close to the big guns but feel very safe. Old Fritz is getting a bad time but he is very plucky   &amp;  tries to get some into us. We are very busy but have a few hours just now, so shall write while I can. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses. From Auntie Eadle</p>
