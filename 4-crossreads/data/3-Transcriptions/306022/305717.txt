<p>Sunday 15th<br/>Pretty cool all day. Washing day, the third since we started.</p>
<p>All got hair cut as there had been a case of supposed meningitis on board, at Cape Town. Our "digestive chap" said "'e worn't goin' ter 'ave 'is bloomin' air cut, meling-gitis or no meling-gitis." but he had to have it off, just the same. He is very funny at lectures and is always asking questions, when he usually gets a bit anxed. The other day</p>
