Gurkha
The Gurkha Regiment were responsible for much valuable work on the pen. They were very active rather small but well built,  On co-operation with the N Zealand they gained the summit of the Sari Bari mountains . They were under the leadership of English officers.
[In a box in the middle of the page a sketch of a Gurkha soldier entitled A Gurkha with the following text]:
On the peninsular the Gurjhas wore light  [indecipherable] uniforms with short trousers and a felt hat similar to our own.  They were well built but small, and were in appearance very much like a Japanese.]
