<p>The thing about Suva is the greenness &ndash; the sward is very fine  -  The Botanic gardens are more like a big green park than any other gardens I've seen &ndash; a glorious carpet of green with hibiscus hedges &ndash; Hibisci do very well in this soft moist climate  -  The double scarlet one is a thing of beauty  -  The cricket ground also possesses a grand turf wicket &amp; the outfield must be excellent  -  Really all this verdure grows on some 2 feet of humus on the tip of sandstone rock  -  Albizzias abound  -  They are a kind of Acacia &ndash; Rawdon knows them  -  We had a fine one next the police station in the hospital grounds at Gayndah   -  Victoria parade is lined with them &amp; on then &ndash; covering their trunks &amp; branches is a fern &ndash; a polypody  -  Ferns do well in this damp land  -  In the axils of leaves of a Palm in the Botanic gardens ferns had been planted from top to bottom &amp; flourished exceedingly &ndash; fronds being 2 feet &amp; more &ndash; Hare's foot fern grew splendidly there  -</p>
