<p>Belgium<br/>25-10-17</p>
<p>Dear Dad,<br/>By this mail I am sending a few cards which are expected to arrive in Australia in time for Xmas.  I have addressed one to Delphine C/o you.  If you know her present location, will you please forward it on.  If you don't know where she is, keep it for me.  It may add a little interest to the cards, when you know that I walked through 7 miles of mud of various depths, and tenacious properties, to a town which was one of the Hun's chief bombing targets, to secure them from one of the few remaining civilians.  I am also sending some little articles of fancy work, hand worked by a couple of Belgian girls, to Kitty and Aunt May.  These perhaps will not arrive as soon as the cards as I learn today that</p>
