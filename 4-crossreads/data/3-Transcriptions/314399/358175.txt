<p>Friday 27 June 1919<br/>Garage at 10 am. Drive early. Did reverse &amp; starting up a hill &amp; did very well. Do me. Had lunch at Bill's place &amp; then we went to Olympia. The Queen, Princess Mary &amp; Prince Henry were there too. They got a huge ovation. The show was good. Consisted of  physical jerks by Waacs &amp; soldiers. Tanks in action. Infantry in action. Frog Cavalry. 18 pounders &amp; two teams of gun running. Also some Scotties dancing. We enjoyed it immensely. Had dinner &amp; then went to Hyde Park &amp; listened to the band. Came home early &amp; read.</p>
<p>Saturday 28 June 1919<br/>PEACE  SIGNED</p>
<p>Up early &amp; round to Bill to tell him I was going to Brighton. Got the 11 am Pullman &amp; arrived in Brighton at 128 pm. Had lunch at St James Restaurant &amp; then went out to the hospital &amp; waited for Janet. She turned up at 2.30 &amp; we then went for a stroll. Watched some cricket near the racecourse &amp; then went into town for tea. Walked along the esplanade to Hove &amp; then into town again for dinner. Quite a huge crowd in the streets. One could hardly move. Rockets, crackers, whistles trumpets. All sorts of things used for making a noise cos peace was signed at 3.30 pm. Got the 9.50 back to London. Searchlights were going everywhere here.</p>
