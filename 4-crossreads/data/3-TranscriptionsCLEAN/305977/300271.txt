  
 September 1915 most of the non-coms are away sick 
 Tuesday 28th A lot of good news came through today.  Russia is doing better & the allies have made an advance in France.  Things look hopeful.  Corpl Cheater & Tpr Mulholland returned today.  They have been away about 2 months  An aeroplane flew over this morning very low.  It was one of ours.  The Turks fire vigorously but made no impression.  Went into the firing line.  The Turks put up a barb wire fence in front of their trench during the night.  Stevens of C Troop was killed through the loophole 
 Wednesday 29th The weather is getting warmer & flies more plentiful.  There has been a lot of big gun fire in the south.  We can't find out exactly what is doing.  Did first shift at night & did our best to stop any more barb wire being put out. 
 Thursday 30th Wasn't feeling so good so paraded to the doctor & got marked exempt
