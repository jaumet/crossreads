  
 November 1917 Saturday 3 Moved camp 1 mile nearer town. Very hot and dusty in morning sultry afternoon and cold nights. Had poultry and beef for dinner yesterday. Horses get plenty of feed from Bedouin camps. Went to Beersheba at night with despatch. Awful ride in dark 
 Sunday 4 Went over to Regt. Passed over battlefield where 4th Bgd charged . saw numerous graves of theirs. Came back to Anzac Div and got word to rejoin Regt. Joined up when they were half way through Beersheba. Dust awful. On the way to Karm for water. Terrible travelling in the dark. Got [indecipherable] in the dark. Camped for night
