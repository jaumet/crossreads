<p>1919<br/>May 22<br/>position.  At the other end of the room the same job was being done by a complicated looking machine.  In the afternoon I went to the Villiers Theatre, in Kingsway (I think) &amp; saw Charlie Chaplin in "Shoulder Arms".  At night I went to His Majestys to see "Chu Chin Chow", the most gorgeous thing of its kind I have ever seen.  Oscar Ashe knows how to make a good show.  On coming away, ones chief thoughts were of the scenery rather than the play, which, stripped of its gaudy tinsel is "The 40 thieves".</p>
<p>May 23<br/>Went to the British Museum, -- opened this time.  Had a good look around the Egyptian relics, Rosetta stone Mausolus &amp; wife (Statues) &amp; also relics of the Roman occupation of Britain.  In the afternoon I went with a party to the Royal Mint, &amp; saw the processes of all coins being made (except sovereigns).  Pennies are stamped out at 150 to the minute.  There was also a machine making War Service medals.  I had not seen any before.  I met Harold afterwards &amp; went to tea</p>
