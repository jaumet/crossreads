FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1919.
Fine & windy. Lopping in Top and
Middle paddocks in morning. Tickle
fixed up Mountain mill stand
in afternoon. He tightened up
everything & rammed the legs.
I collected the dead wool from
Cow, Boundary & Mountain paddocks
Alan & the others went down to
Merton in the big car.
