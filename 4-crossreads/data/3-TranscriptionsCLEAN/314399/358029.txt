  
 Saturday 1 February 1919 Arrived at Harfleur Halle at 2 pm. We were some tired too. Altho we slept warm & had a good sleep. Marched to the camp & went to the A.G.B.D. No body has any idea of what is going to happen to us yet. Our home is in a hut without a stove & on the floor. 
 Sunday 2 February 1919 Checked for orderly officer straight away. As usual very little to do. Managed to do the needful. Got a job at 9 pm tho & had to go to the station & wait till a train came in & then guide the diggers to the camp. Got home at1 am. Still on the floor. Sleep in my valise tonight. Too cold otherwise.
