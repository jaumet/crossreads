<p>thank my lucky stars that I had not walked off the edge. The boys some of the chaps that send Fritz his iron rations (that is Royal Garrison Artillery) made me stay till morning as it was too risky going any further, although the camp that had been shifted near Longueval was only about two hundred yards away.</p>
<p>The next day we left for the 18th and spent the night at a rest camp near Albert. The day after (Nov 25th) we rejoined the old crowd at Ribemont.</p>
<p>We stayed there for five days then the Brigade moved out to Cardonette and the surrounding villages where we had been before. It was our bad luck to get billeted in Cardonette which place we called the "Village of the dead." From Cardonette we got leave to Amiens which was only five miles away. I went several times to that city visiting the cathedral and one or two other places. We left Cardonette on December 16th and billeted at Franvillers</p>
