<p>June<br/>interesting than the work I have been doing. Spent afternoon puting in Oversee Kit &amp; drawing U.K. kit.</p>
<p>Friday 21st<br/>Went to parade ground but the Major sent us back to inspect our kits. Went through Gas chamber. Some 'Cow' has stolen my lovely riding pants. Thus vanity has cost me two lovely Bradburys Don't feel up to much tonight.</p>
<p>Saturday 22<br/>Went sick &amp; got a surprise when the Dr sayed "hospital for you" My tempre was just over the 100 mark &amp; that is the great thing in the army. It does not matter how you feel without a temperature you are not sick. It was 8 AM when I went to the Dr Had to put our Kits away &amp; be ready for the ambulance at 9.30 waited until about 11 for it. Went to No 1 Comand Depo Hospital waited some time before they found out there was no room for us. Were taken on to the big Hospital at Sutton Veny</p>
