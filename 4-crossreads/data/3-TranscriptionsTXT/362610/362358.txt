 Monday 22 May 1916 Having handed over the company was not attached for any particular duty but at little unimportant things when not taking things easy. A warm day with a light shower towards evening. After tea went to a concert given in the Munay Hut by an English party, &amp; enjoyed it immensely. A detail of officers to proceed to the front came out just after tea, my name being included. Much excitement &amp; bustle caused by it.
