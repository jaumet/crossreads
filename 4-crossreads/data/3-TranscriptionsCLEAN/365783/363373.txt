  
 our camp is pitched is under water when the Nile inundates and if you scratch a few inches you come on to dampness.   I think this is largely responsible for the prevalence of pneumonia amongst the men.   I had to go out and inspect an Arab village this afternoon - I rode out on a donkey - wonderful little animals they are - it is surprising to see the huge loads they carry - so also the camels;  they are generally loaded up with a bundle of stuff about the size of a haystack.   I often wonder how you all are and indeed where you are - I have not yet had a letter & it is now 3 weeks since we arrived here.  I send herewith a photo of myself taken a few days ago - also two photos taken on the Kyarra.   My tent is very comfortable - I borrowed a small chest of drawers from Mena House & keep a lot of my clothes in it.   I have a large table at which I am now writing - in front of me pinned to the fly of the tent is the portfolio of all the dear ones.   I have found the mosquito net of great service - in spite of the cold the mosquitoes are very bad - none of the other fellows have nets - some of them have a sort of canopy made of butter muslin. I must now end up with the best love to the dearest of women & hoping to see you all before very long, Yr. loving husband Will
