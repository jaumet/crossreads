<p>MARCH 1917</p>
<p>16 FRIDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; fairly warm. Cleaning</p>
<p>up round stables in morning</p>
<p>&amp; we took our guns out to a</p>
<p>new position in Ploegstreeet</p>
<p>in evening, the centre</p>
<p>section coming with us.</p>
<p>The &quot;posie&quot; is not nearly as</p>
<p>good as the old one, but</p>
<p>it might be a lot worse.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a great shell hole</p>
<p>through the wall, &amp; in the</p>
<p>ground all round, so its</p>
<p>been pretty lively there at</p>
<p>one time. Got back about</p>
<p>9 pm &amp; had tea &amp; then had</p>
<p>to turn out again &amp; draw</p>
<p>ammunition at the dump.</p>
