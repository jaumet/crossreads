3know the men now.
I have met no one yet who can give me first hand information about Alan's death. The card say's, "Died of Wounds France Aug 14th at 21st Casualty Clearing Station, Warloy France." A Casualty Clearing Station is as near to the scene of battle that a rough hospital can be placed. The field dressing station is the only one in the line itself. The C.C S never retains its men longer than to perform operations necessary for saving life, & then draughts the wounded to Base & field hospitals. Alan must have been picked up by the stretcher bearers which was lucky, for only too many men go down in no-man's land and are soon buried by shellfire. Thus I think mother you can rest assured you will get some of Alan's private effects. It was indeed lucky he died in a C.C.S. Anyway I've been to Head Quarters & have got Col. Anderson on the track. I will never rest till I find the men who were with him when he went down.
I'm glad all the girls have been over to see you. Poor Una, what a great sport she is. I'll bet all the little reminders she must have got at home were stings to her. It's dreadful about Alan Blackett & Jack Curtis isn't it. I have written to their people.
