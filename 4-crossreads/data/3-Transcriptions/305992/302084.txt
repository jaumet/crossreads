<p>The H.M.A.T. Camberra &amp; H.M.T. Norman still here moored with us at the entrance of the cannel full of troops. At noon we had orders to proceed to Port Said, so at 4 pm we let go &amp; proceeded in charge of a pilot steaming through the cannel. A bow search light put on board for the purpose of steaming through at night. We expect to be at P. Said at 9 am to morrow morning unless we have to make fast for ships to pass.<br/>Whilst steaming through the cannel at 5.30 pm one of the Lieut.'s of the flying corps which we brought over from Basra this trip flew low &amp; circled around us 4 times quite a treat. He kept a distance of 200 feet away &amp; finally flew back to the hydroplane depot.<br/>At 12 pm we reached Ismalia &amp; change of pilots. Here we heard of the hospital ship Kanowra having struck the bank yesterday &amp; aground in the cannel for 5 hours &amp; having lost 2 blades of her propellors. She was bound from Australia to Port Said for wounded soldiers.</p>
