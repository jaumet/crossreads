<p>16.6.15<br/>Wed. 16th.  I was in charge of another party of 10 men from 4 till 8 last night.  We were on the same job at the Supply Depot &amp; the officious Sergeant was quite the reverse &amp; affable, apparently the telling off he got from Cooper the night before brought him to his senses.  Penny went to the beach for a swim this afternoon but the Turks were dropping shrapnel on the beach all the afternoon &amp; he had to return without it.  Yesterday afternoon we were issued with new socks, flannels &amp; pants &amp; we put in this morning cutting off the surplus material on the bottom of our trousers.  At 12 oclock to-day we had to go on sapping on the New Zealand trenches.  Lieut. McMillan was in charge;  while we were on it, an artillery duel was fought lasting half an hour.  Our warboats have been very busy all the afternoon, more troops landing.</p>
