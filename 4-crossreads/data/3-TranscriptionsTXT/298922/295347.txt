Sunday 21 January 1917
Regiment staying out at the Bivy & the rest may go out tonight. Just got letters from Mother l5/11/16 & Joe enclosing Diary 12/11/16 Diary - been to England & back, I don't think we missed many.
Very sorry poor little Blackie is dead - I know what a dog's affection is worth. Re Bulletin Pars re self - there won't be any PRAM coming home with Dolly & I!  Will post this as I never like risking losing or anyone finding my Diary on me.
28 Turksjust be sent in by Regiment. The Bedouins kill them if they get stragglers or deserters. I suppose they would us too.
