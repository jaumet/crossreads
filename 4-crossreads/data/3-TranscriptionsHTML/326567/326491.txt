<p>I soon found one with the Rising Sun on the Front &amp; marked No 3. On asking the Driver if he knew my brother &amp; as luck was with me, he happened to know him so he gave me a lift into the Town &amp; right up to the Workshops. It was still raining &amp; everything was wet &amp; the Roads &amp; yds were very Muddy. As my brother was away at Dinner I went to his billet &amp; met him as I had not seen him for 10 years our Meeting was one of pleasure. As I was hungry he soon procured some dinner &amp; he got leave for the Afternoon so we spent the Afternoon in his room chatting &amp; exchanging views. After have a good Dinner at 5.30 we went for a stroll around the own. All the French Towns I have been have a Big Square which is used as a Market place. This one is used for the Motor Waggons &amp; the Workshops staff &amp; other ranks use some of the buildings for their quarters, My Brother's quarters are A1 he &amp; two other chums have a room upstairs in a building &amp; they have a stove in it for Winter use also a Wardrobe for their clothes &amp; a Kerosene</p>
