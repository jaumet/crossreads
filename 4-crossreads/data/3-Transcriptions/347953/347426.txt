<p>Deaths in England</p>
<p>Unfortunately the climatic conditions of England are unsuitable  &amp; far too severe for the Australian troops.  In our camp alone at Westham &amp;  [indecipherable] the average rate per day of deaths is two, due mostly to pneumonia &amp; meningitis.  While at the training camps were conditions of camp life are far worse than here the deaths amount to a far larger proportion, and I believe the average rate of deaths per day throughout all camps in England amount to about 20.</p>
<p>All the corpses are buried in the beautiful burial grounds of  [indecipherable]</p>
