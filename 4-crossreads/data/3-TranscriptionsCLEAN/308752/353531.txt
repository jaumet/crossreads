The match was very exciting at times. Fortunately I did not have to walk back to our village, managed to obtain a lift in an ambulance car.
Nothing of any startling nature to report during the week,  just the same routine each day,  a short route march every morning, just for a little exercise.  On Friday evening the 25th inst. a lecture was given by Captain Robinson on the Present position of the War. It was indeed a brilliant & most interesting lecture & I obtained a far deeper knowledge of this World wide calamity.
This day was also chosen for the Final of the football competition.  I walked thirteen kilos to see this game & well worth the walk it was too. It was a great battle, the A.M.C. won the match, so of course won the cup. The cheering at the end of the match was deafening, it may interest you to know the Bilgie May is a member of our team.
Before I go any further I must state a few lines about the weather. For the last fortnight it has been absolutely perfect, & one of us can growl at it. It has resembled the climate of our "sunny homeland",  this will probably be hard for you to believe, but is the gospel truth.
