<p>When coming along the deck soon after I saw a nurse opening a box of chocolate sponge.  I said, "If I were at home one of my best girls would be offering me one of those" &ndash; She at once gave me one.  I said, "I shall write home &amp; tell my best girls that Nurse Deere from South Australia gave me a chocolate sponge".  You know a white-ant building, which in response to the first bite suggests the work of the termite on wood.  Another Sister, (the nurses of the Army Corps are Sisters), Nurse Haynes from South Australia selected for me a hard chocolate, as recompense I said "I shall at once write to my best girls and tell them that Sister Haines from South Australia gave me a hard chocolate."  Haha!  Haha!!!  Haha!!!!!  Haha!!!!!!!</p>
<p>4-30 p.m.  While you are saying your prayers preparatory for bed many merry parties are scattered throughout our ship enjoying afternoon tea, while eatables consist of Christmas cakes, many hued, and other fancy small-goods lie temptingly displayed to coax each appetite to satisfy itself.  Melancholy has no place here.  Laughter holding both his sides holds jocund sway, filling the tropic air with musically happy sounds, such as become the gay &amp; youthful spirits from whence it flows.  Good luck to them all!  May the world always deal kindly with them &amp; God give each chance to see many more Christmas days each flowing over with all that is good &amp; merry.  Old men look on while youth disports itself and can but think back upon the times that were.  Major Grey &amp; other</p>
