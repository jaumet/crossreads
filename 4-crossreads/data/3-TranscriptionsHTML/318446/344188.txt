<p>El Arish, Dec. 24th<br/>At 4.30 yesterday the Turks suddenly caved in &amp; all was over.  However a fair number managed to get away and also to take their mountain guns with them.  Wrong, we got the guns.  In all the Division captured 1250 Turks out of a supposed 2000 which was not bad.  We stayed out picking up the men until about midnight &amp; then came back here reaching here about 7.30 a.m.  The desert was a picturesque sight last night as each wounded man or group had lit a fire to guide us.  'Magdabeh' &ndash; the name of the place &ndash; has three very good stone buildings like schoolrooms &ndash; the Turkish Hospital - also a big reservoir with stone troughs.  Altogether rather an imposing place for the desert.<br/>The Anzac Division came off very cheaply about 65 casualties I believe</p>
