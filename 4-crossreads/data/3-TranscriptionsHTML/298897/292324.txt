<p>Friday 14th July.</p>
<p>Had a very busy day chiefly rearranging the dispensary.  Quite a lot of empty bottles &amp; other gear had been allowed to collect and the place was in somewhat of a mess so I got right into it &amp; squared the whole show up, a job I rather enjoy &amp; am getting quite used to.  We have a dispensary complete enough to run a hospital with instead of a rest camp.  The afternoon was quiet &amp; I managed to write several letters which required answering.</p>
<p>Saturday 15th July<br/>Ordinary routine work mostly &amp; that rather moderate. Went through all the wards &amp; inspected their medicines discarding old stuff &amp; taking a list of what remained.  I then formed a list with index complete so I could see at a glance what each ward contained.  No sooner was this completed than I had word we had to shift once again.  I had been for a walk to the No. 2 CCS new station at "Steenwerck". They had formed a camp under the supervision of an R.E. man &amp; were just completed ready for patients.  Half of the tents were stained brown &amp; half green</p>
