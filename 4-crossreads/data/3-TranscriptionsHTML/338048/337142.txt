<p>Sunday 24th<br/>Up today with a definite thing to do as I found out the [Canns?] Lane church was well worth visiting. So after breakfast I went there and got a good seat. It was a Congregational Church which Dr. Jowett used to have previous to going to America. He used to command tremendous congregations &amp; now he returns once a year &amp; admittance to church is by ticket only. I am sending home the church programme. The place was rather fashionable and though people <strike>were did</strike> were rather reserved I managed to get a hymn book &amp; greatly enjoyed the whole service. The anthem was fine.</p>
