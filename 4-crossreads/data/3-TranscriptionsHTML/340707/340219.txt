<p>89<br/>there is nothing doing &amp; though I am sure I can walk without detriment I remain within. At night Marie Le Breton &amp; her husband come to dinner.</p>
<p>They have seen Paris. It is absolutely deserted &amp; the papers have pictures showing the places ordinarily thronged with people without a single person or vehicles visible. &ndash; A scene of desolation &amp; the photos are taken at 2 pm &amp; onwards &amp; the photo are those that are taken in an ordinary stroll.</p>

To back is a collection of slums patched up by rags &amp; temporary makeshifts &amp; filled with a population whose chief characteristics are age &amp; filth, &amp; into whose daily habits you can inspect. There are some children aged about 10 though how they have survived so long. Goodness knows.</p>
