 31/8/15 A fairly good roll has made a good many sick.  Beautiful blue skies and a cool breeze.  Boat drill 11 am with all hands standing at stations.

As head of column passed the Market a native woman came towards us with her head down pushing a cart of sukkar melons.  As soon as she saw us she gave an agonised shriek and fled down a side street as hard as she could.  Experience teaches these folk to take no risks when a tired or thirsty crowd like ours is on the march.  We have a crowd of English officers aboard and some got very boozed at the bar tonight and retired helpless.
