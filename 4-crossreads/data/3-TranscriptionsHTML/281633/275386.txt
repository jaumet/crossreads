<p>while we were having tea.  I was unlucky being end man on the lower side, the stool broke away &amp; collapsed &amp; I slid down onto a nail with the other 5 on my side on top of me which of course helped to drive the nail in, add to this the Table &amp; its contents, Tea, Sugar, Jam, Butter, &amp; cataracts of table utensils and you may guess how I felt.  I visited the Dressing Station right away.</p>
