  
 The Saturday before leaving Freetown we had to take 60 sailors on board from the H.M.S.King Alfred. The sailors were reserves, and were going to England. We had also to take 450 men (Australian Soldiers) from the Port Lincoln on board, as their ship had run onto a sand bank at the mouth of the Harbour, and had strained her plates in her effort to get off.
