wasn't cancelled. I was sorry to come here at first, but now I am very pleased.
We are camped on a sort of railway siding beside an old platform right on the river bank. The bridge itself, running practically North and South is a little bit higher up the river & cannot be seen from the camp itself, as a steep hill shuts it from our view. The defences are beautiful, & it would do your heart good to see them. If we are attacked, it will be from the North side of the bridge as that is the only possible side by which a surprise could be effected; & it would be mighty hard to do it from there. In event of this happening, we have a plan of campaign action all mapped out. Sentries patrol up and down the bridge which is about 3/4 mile long day & night to prevent anyone tampering with it. A day or so before I came up, they captured three German spies in & a nice little auxiliary boat like Dr Scott Skirving's. They said they were fishermen; but the funny part of it was, they knew nothing about fishing. Plenty of other things have happened, which I will tell you when I get back. Must stop now.
I hope you will be right again soon, & don't worry
Your loving son Keith.
