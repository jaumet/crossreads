<p>Friday 28th May 1915<br/>Now that it is not vaccination or inoculation its hot sultry trying weather. We must be nearing the tropics- everyone is appearing in light attire &amp; we have permission to please ourselves from Matron to day of how we dress for dinner. It has been compulsory to wear our grey dresses &ndash; red capes  &amp; white caps &amp; the effect was very pretty.<br/>We have a lecture every afternoon from 3 to 4 pm. by one of the officers &ndash; yesterday Dr Stawell from Melbourne gave us one on Florence Nightingale &amp; a more beautiful &amp; impressive lecture I have never listened to. I think very few of us realised before what a grand woman she was &amp; the good work she accomplished &ndash; again I think we all felt proud to be a red cross band going out stimulated to do our little bit.<br/>Last night the red cross boys gave a concert over on the 2nd class deck. The musical part was most enjoyable.<br/>The time seems to pass quickly what with parades &ndash; lectures - concerts etc.<br/>This morning we had to practise putting on our life belts &amp; to see they were all in good order. There is an indescribable air</p>
