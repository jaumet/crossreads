 What rot about Billy getting married.  Billy Allison is here in this camp with me &amp; is my constant companion as ever, &amp; is no more married than I am.  I shall  not  be marrying.  I have met one Girl here that I would have married, but everyone writing, "Don't bring an English wife out", deferred my action, &amp; I have lost perhaps the best woman that I have ever met.  It does not matter very much though.  I can be quite happy, single; I shall have to work very hard when I get back &amp; I shall not want to be running about with Girls anymore;  I am past that stage now &amp; have my own hobbies to occupy my time fully &amp; contentedly.
