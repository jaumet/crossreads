Wednesday 6 November
Wet again prospects looked rotten for a move. However, after having packed even fallen in one parade, an order came, say no movement of troops is to take place to-day. Postponed for at least 24 hours. Good news from the front, the Germans retreating for on a 70 mile front.
Thursday 7 November
After three parades to-day, much to the amusement of the villagers, we finally moved by march route to Villers-sous-Ailly, six or seven miles, where we are now billeted in a huge barn. Oh, we miss our beds of Pont Remy. Peace is in sight!! German delegates have crossed line to confer with Foch on armistice terms.
