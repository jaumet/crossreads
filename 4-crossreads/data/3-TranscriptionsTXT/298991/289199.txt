Thursday August 9thRather cold early this morning, but came out fine about 9 am.Parade held at 6.45 am, & all our particulars taken, also parade held at 9 a.m, when our kits were inspected, & medical classified. I am still B.1 B. Dental parade held at 2 pm, I have to have my teeth attended to there are two of my teeth to be filled. Alloted to No 2 Company & put in hut 14. We have still got the wire mattresses & good beds. They seem a very rowdy mob in the hut, but of course a fellow can expect nothing less, seeing that every one is out of a different unit. Went to a concert in Y.M.C.A. no good.
Friday August 10thWe have only two parades a day to attend on,  6.45 am & 1.30 pm, otherwise we have nothing to do, except mess orderly about once a fortnight. Was reclassified again this morning, I am still marked the same, the Dr did not ask me many questions. Was fine until about 5 pm, when it rained fairly heavy. Went to the pictures in the Y.M.C.A. They were splendid, the best show I have seen for a long while. There is some sort of entertainment on in the Y.M.C.A. every night, (bar Sunday), including pictures twice a week . The food is very good here. We get plumb pudding for dinner every second day.
