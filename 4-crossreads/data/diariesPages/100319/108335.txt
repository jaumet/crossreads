29/8/18 Herbecourt
ourselves in the old Isolation fever ward. From this place we see a high ridge covered with woods about 5 kilos away and taking a sharp right angled turn this is the far bank of the River Somme and at the foot of the portion directly to our front is the town of Peronne. The enemy is holding this and the other side of the village strongly and preventing our crossing. The 23rd have some of their companies in old YMCAs which adjoin here but as Fritz was using a high velocity gun with good effect close to here I issued orders for all my chaps to be in trenches and am shifting out myself. Tonight the men get a hot meal and a meat supper and draw their greatcoats for the night. No word of an immediate move.
