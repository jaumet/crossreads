<p>Dear George</p>
<p>I have just received your welcome letter also parcel of Tobacco. for which I am very thankful for. Thanks Mrs Alfonso for posting same &amp; her luck was in as I received the Tobacco alright.</p>
<p>Things have been just middling here but I hope by the time you receive this letter that we have got them 'set. As you say George we want men of Brains and I believe it is a thing that the British have missed.</p>
<p>No doubt you are reading the papers about the way things are going.</p>
<p>The French are a wonderful race besides taking over different parts of the line the populace are sticking to it great</p>
