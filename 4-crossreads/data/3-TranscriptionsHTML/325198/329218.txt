<p>18 January, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>It was all bustle this morning. I had to look around to find any blankets for they were not to be found when I got home from Cairo. last night indeed at first I could not find anything, but  after a look about found my saddle &amp; got my coat off  it &amp; then got a spare couple of blankets so was alright. I got all my gear this morning except one blanket. We had to pack up this morning &amp; be away by nine oclock. We went to Heloun &amp; returned this afternoon. I feel tired &amp; not much in the humour to take charge of the stable pickquet, however we have got all the horses fed &amp; the men are posted so I think I will turn in. Some of the men who went away with a composite regiment have come back tonight. they had a couple of brushes with the enemy &amp; dispersed them. I don't know where they were yet. That bally dentist kept my plate so I have to go in again to see him</p>
