my heart is in a very bad way due to the straining of a valve, but I hope to get home pretty soon now.  It's heaven here to have the gentle touch of a woman's hand as she ministers to one. What a curse this world would be without women.

Just received notification today that I've been award the D.S.O. for the Urmiah stunt. Left Bombay Jan 1st to join the 24th but stopped here & am due to leave for Aust any day.  What will home mean after the last 4 years.
