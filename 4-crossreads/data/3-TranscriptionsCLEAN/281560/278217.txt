  
 21/2/16 We have to go through the whole syllabus of infantry training here, right from "Right Turn!" by numbers. It is very monotonous, and we hoped to get something fresh here. The picquet duty is finished tonight.  22/2/16 Had half a day off today; struck a good fatigue job; and Palmer and I got down into Cario. The more I see of this city the better I like it. The European quarter is very nice, with wide streets and gardens. We also inspected the native quarter and saw some surprising sights. Armed myself with a stout cane to keep off, the boot-blacks, beggars, and other pests. The evening's amusement cost 5 piasters the cheapest I ever had. Got back to camp at midnight.
