 I fear that in my reference to our men here I do them far less than justice. Coming as I did from the shambles before Ypres & finding the Light-Horse more or less in rest in the [prime] of the year I was unfairly biassed. Since then I have seen a lot of their life & fighting & am able to get a good sense of what they endured
