<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I got a telephone message at Helouan Hospital (Egypt) at 12</p>
<p>Noon on Sunday 26th March 1916 that my unit ( 9/17 ) was to move out</p>
<p>at 7 a.m. next morning from Heliopolis and I had no hesitation in</p>
<p>telling them that I would be with them when they moved. &nbsp;Under ord-</p>
<p>inary circumstances I would have been discharged from the Convales-</p>
<p>cent Hospital within two days and would then have had to go to the</p>
<p>&quot;Overseas Base&quot; and from there to some strange unit and possibly</p>
<p>stay in Egypt for months. &nbsp;We were particularly lucky to get away</p>
<p>so soon as a lot of the earlier reinforcements to the 17th Batt.</p>
<p>were still in Egypt. &nbsp;Plenty of men had been in Egypt 5 months and</p>
<p>never had a move. &nbsp;Instead of making the 9th Reinforcement we will</p>
<p>probably form the 1st Reinforcement to the 17th Batt. &nbsp;I went over</p>
<p>to Heliopolis where the 9/17 were camped on Sunday afternoon to make</p>
<p>all arrangements and returned to Helouan in the evening to get my</p>
<p>discharge from Hospital, luggage etc. &nbsp;Coming back to Cairo about 11</p>
<p>p.m. I got a motor car from the Railway Station to take me right</p>
<p>out to the Camp (about 10 miles) but after it had gone a mile or so</p>
<p>in trying to avoid another car coming round a corner it ran over the&nbsp;</p>
<p>pavement and smacked a wall. &nbsp;The wall came off best so I had to</p>
<p>transfer my baggage and self&nbsp;to another car. &nbsp;The run out to Helio-</p>
<p>polis is very pretty even at night and the road is perfect - as a</p>
<p>matter of fact, Australia (and Particularly N.S.W.) is the only</p>
<p>place I have seen which has bad roads. &nbsp;Arriving at Camp. I found</p>
<p>my old orderly had made a bunk up for me in a tent so I turned in</p>
<p>for a couple of hours - the only occasion on which I had slept</p>
<p>in camp in Egypt. &nbsp;Reveille went at 2 a.m. breakfast at 3am. and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
