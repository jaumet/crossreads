<p>Monday 13th. Aug.<br/>  Things now very brisk in the ambulance in the way of drill &amp; training.  We have been so long out of the line that the officers are looking round for something to do &amp; the unit actually was deteriorating.  The Co. has now taken a grip on things in general and everyone has to attend all parades &amp; drill, route marches, etc are the order of the day.  The result will be good even if 'tis irksome.  This morning we had Gas drill &amp; inspection of helmets in which latter they utilised my services as usual.  In the afternoon we had a lecture, the usual style &amp; then I had a run into St Omer on one of the cars   I have had to move out of my billet, apparently I was too comfortable or else they thought I was too far from their influence, however I had to leave &amp; take up my quarters in a loft with the others.  The colonel is evidently trying to hand over a very smart ambulance to his successor.</p>
