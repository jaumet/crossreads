<p>Wednesday Nov 6 1918. 1555 days of the war.<br/>I was wakened by the nurse at 20 past 4 who came along with a dish of water for me to have a wash. Then I got dressed in hospital clothes &amp; had a bread &amp; jam breakfast &amp; was ready to start for Blighty at 5 o'clock.<br/>After a long wait during which we had some more breakfast &ndash; 3 sardines &amp; bread &amp; butter, we were put into stretchers at 9 a.m. in readiness for the Red Cross cars to take us to the train. The cars were busy all</p>
<p>morning removing patients to the station. At a quarter to 10 we were informed that we would not be sent away today as the train had completed its load &amp; was gone. So we will have to wait here a few days longer.</p>
<p>Thursday Nov 7 1918. 1556.<br/>A fine day. A nice change from the past few wet days.<br/>There is a possibility of those who are detailed for Blighty being sent away this afternoon.<br/>I was up early 9 a.m. this morning and had a walk around the hospital grounds.<br/>7 patients died last night.</p>
