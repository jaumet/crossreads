<p>Fine but very cold in morning &amp; evening. Out with the rangetaking ect class all day. Poss &amp; self went up to Larkhill afterwards &amp; I got a letter from father &amp; also a draft of&nbsp;&pound;25 from Uncle Richard. We went to the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; pictures ect afterwards &amp; they were not too bad. There was a football meeting of the 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery in the evening but there was not much business done except electing officers for the Club.</p>
