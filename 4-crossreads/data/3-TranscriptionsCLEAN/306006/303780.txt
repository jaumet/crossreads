  
 18-3-17 brought Cobb back to the Anzac Hostel where she was to meet Sergt Marsh at 6.30 Harris & I met Kingsford there had dinner & the heard the Welsh choir giving a concert till 9 oclock & then came back early. Several coming merry last night had a few words with the Police at Heliopolis who tried to arrest them but found they could not as they made a fight of it; Tonight the Police got square as the whole Troop was waiting for the 10 oclock & 10.30 train they took all the passes from the lads as they got out & then allowed them to come on to camp several of the lads had faked passes, it will end in a riot here before long
