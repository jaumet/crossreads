<p>5-4-16  Wednesday<br/>Now in the Red Sea passed a number of Rocky Islets this morning heard that they were called the 12 apostles there was a lighthouse on one of them.  It must be a lonely job.  Hot as Hell no, Hotter than any hell.  We passed another Islet with a lighthouse the name of it sounds like [space] The heat (5.0 PM) tween decks is something awefull everybody practically naked &amp; the perspiration running off them in streams slopping off their arms onto the table like water.  The smell of man is something terrific  not dirty but caused by abnormal sweating.  I have been doing a little boxing lately &amp; feel the benefit of it, shall keep it up untill we land if possible.  We must be in the danger zone now because the lights are masked now</p>
