 My dear Mrs. Richards, 
 When reading a letter which came in the last mail, I was very much shocked to hear of the sad news about Roy, of whom I should like to offer you and the whole family my sincerest sympathy.  Everyone knowing Roy even casually would at once perceive his sterling qualities.  Few however had the same opportunities as myself, who found him in everyday life in sport, and as it has proved in War as true and as honest a chap as could be wished for. 
 Yours very sincerely, (Sgd) Dudley Deering
