 Sunday 26 September, 1915 
 Went to church &amp; Holy Communion. 
 Two friends of Bernie Morris came up in the evening. 
 I received G&#39;burn papers. They were very welcome and I did not know what to do with myself so I had a good long read of G&#39;burn news. 
 Today specially in the afternoon, has been the quietest that I can remember, it was just like a Sunday afternoon at home.
