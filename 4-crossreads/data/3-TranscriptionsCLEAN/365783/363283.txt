  
 city out to the ship (about 3 miles) & met Captain Jacobs the Hornsby area officer - he is going in charge of the reinforcements for the first expeditionary force. Do not bring my big winter overcoat home with you. I can easily convert my military great coat into a civilian one. I think it is a good idea Arch sending that 100 home & making the a/c. operable by either of us. Please ask Mr Whatmore what more he wants - the swine -. Arch handed me the keychain before leaving - thanks very much for it & and the silk handkerchief the later was quite a mystery to me. I managed to get all my gear into the cabin - Major Grey also & and we have plenty of room to kick about.
