 Has good knowledge of his work and is able to impart it to his section. Is about 20 years old, well educated and has fair control. Is cool and unexcitable, and I think would be a good man on service. Is inclined to be a bit lazy, but given extra responsibility, would carry out his duties to your satisfaction 
 X  Coproral Rees  
 A really good N.C.O.  Has good control, reliable and trustworthy in every way. I have not the slightest hesitation in recommending him for promotion at the first opportunity 
 X  Coporal Kilgour  
 A good steady reliable N.C.O. Has very good control.  give him a job and you can rest assured it will be carried out satisfactorily. Health not too good, and there are other N.C.O's I would recommend for promotion before him. 
 X  Corpl. Bagnell  
 In my opinion is slack, and owing either to his youth or natural disposition is not fit for further promotion.
