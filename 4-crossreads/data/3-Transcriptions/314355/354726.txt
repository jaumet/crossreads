<p>?<br/>Billets<br/>April 13<br/>51.<br/>A detraining at midday and after Mess issue, C Section up to establish A.D.S., A and B back to reserve &ndash; for mobile Dressing Stations for Advance or Retreat.</p>
<p>All the afternoon 18 pounders have been firing by us, and the chorus behind has been of Machine Guns.</p>
<p>And tonight the elatant rumour comes of the 3rd and 4th having driven the Boche back from Strazeele 1&frac12; miles.  Good old First.</p>
<p>Were supported by the old 29th Division.  This afternoon a drinking fraternising with Newfoundlanders in a small estaminet.</p>
<p>A Billet above cows and fowls:  deep straw'd and a deeply thatched roof.</p>
<p>A Bearers turning in with warning of being earlily needed.</p>
<p>We're newly equipped, last night midnight saw the brilliant retreat of the 1 A.C.C.S.  At least we can answer well the "what have you salved today".  Half of us have new tunics, new puttees, new underwear and luxuries we can never carry.  A whole C.S.S. has been abandoned, full of hospital gear and R.C. Comforts, Towels, sox, new holdalls, lovely soft woollen jackets and books, even new Swiss Cottage Tents, bedding and lounge chairs &ndash; with three pianos, and a great library.</p>
<p>From a library I salved "The Sentimental Bloke" &ndash; with an inscription from some Padre, Ruskin's "Modern Painters", Wilde's "Charmides" and "Ballade of Reading Gaol", "Bindle", "Lost Tribes" and Marian Crawford's "The Witch of Prague".</p>
<p>Neeve sent a guard down there when he'd heard of it &ndash; and incidentally salved some stuff:  they acted to us as "shopwalkers" &ndash; so saving a <strike>most</strike> deal of walking.</p>
<p>There's not the slightest doubt there's a most severe vertical breeze blowing hereabouts, two C.C.S. &ndash; splendidly equipped and compleat, have been abandoned almost entirely, to our benefit immediately, but with a scandalous callousness to the chaps in the line.</p>
<p>A rumour comes from the Somme of the Boche having been forced back over 20 kilometres.</p>
<p>So to bed, trooper fashion, with boots &amp; gas bag handy.</p>
