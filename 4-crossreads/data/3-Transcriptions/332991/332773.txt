<p>Wednesday March 7. 1917<br/>It was very cold and windy last night.  But it is worse to day.  The wind has increased in violence and is bitterly cold.  The mud is frozen hard again by the icy wind and the water in buckets has a coating of ice on it all day.  Most of the patients are staying in bed all day, while others only get up for meals.<br/>In Hospital one hears various tales of the trenches and experiences of Hospitals and these exchanges of experiences and adventures help to pass the time away.  Cards and draughts have their devotes, but today the games are not continued long for it is too cold.  I played a few games of draughts to day, and won them all.  I only lost one game yesterday.</p>
