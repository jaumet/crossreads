<p>I've been lately thinking over Bil the Kaiser<br/>The man that wants to rule the Land &amp; sea<br/>Now when I think of Balmy bil the Kaiser<br/>I wonder does he think the same of me.<br/>in fighting he is very fond of fireling [firing?]<br/>John Bull will find his points without a doubt.<br/>Now here's a man with fame as bad as Nero's<br/>What do you think of him I like to know.</p>
<p>Now all you have to do is to boo boo boys<br/>When I ask you what you think of Kaiser Bil.<br/>In fact well you can call him what you like Boys<br/>And when your's on your own I know you will,<br/>Your often heard him speak in praise of heroes,<br/>in chorusus you will let your voices rise,<br/>Before he has a chance to throw towel in<br/>Count up to nine &amp; put the blighter out.</p>
