  
 so far, one of my pals have lent me hers but I shall get one of my own now, it is very necessary. I have plenty of money to go on with. Everything is very expensive, so try to be careful. So glad you are all keeping well. Eddy must be a little trick. I can just imagine how delighted he would be to work with that neighbour.  I wish I could get something to send him from here. Fondest love to you all & trust you have a happy Xmas time, hope to be with you all before next Xmas. Kisses to Eddy & tell him I love his letters. A big hug for dear old Mother.                                                                                                                                    From,                                                                                                                                                             Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                             Edith.
