 I arrived in Bulford at 9 a.m. this morning.  I am now a Staff Sergeant &amp; dine with Ellis.  It is very nice &amp; the meals to-day were very nice &amp; quite the best I've had issued in the Army.  I have a dozen letters to get away to-night &amp; I've given you all the news as I've travelled so I'll now wind up.  I had a glorious Holiday &amp; feel like a new man with a new lease on life. 
 We had no comforts from the Firm this year at all.  We will look out for the Comforts Fund lot when it comes to hand.  I am glad that you know what No. 9's are.  Cut one in halves &amp; swallow that way &amp; drink a cup of a Hot water &amp; you'll think its your last Birthday. 
 Well, Mum, Dad &amp; George, I'll have to try &amp; get some more letters done &amp; as I said above, I have given you all the news. 
 Love to you all Harry 
 I've heaps of money now.  H.D.
