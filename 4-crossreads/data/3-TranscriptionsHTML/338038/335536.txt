<p>[Newspaper cutting]<br/>S.M.Herald<br/>The Australians<br/>20/4/18<br/>Heroic battle fought<br/>(Official Commonwealth Correspondent)<br/>London, April 17.<br/>It is now possible to state that the Australian divisions, which were hurried down at the beginning of the last week of March to block the German advance on Amiens, were the third and fourth.  The fourth division holds the reputation throughout the force as the most travelled Australian division about France.  It has fought in every field, with invariably the greatest distinction.  The third division, the newest of all, had never before fought outside Flanders, and came to the Somme country with the keenest enthusiasm.  Its battalions had long endured the friendly chaff of other divisions,  that they were not dinkum Anzacs, as they had never seen the Somme.  They had the honour of bestriding a ridge between the Somme and the Ancre in the direct path of the Germans, where they were sent in to battle individually as they dismounted from omnibuses, and flung themselves against the enemy advance guards.</p>
<p>On March 27 and 28 two brigades made a brilliant skirmishing advance south of Mericourt and drove in the enemy advanced lines.  Clearing a large portion of Treux Wood, they established a firm line running in the direction of Sailly, which they held against all attacks.  In this advance a Tasmanian battalion, made a particularly gallant fight.  The fourth came into action contemporaneously west of Albert, after a magnificent forced march already described.  One of its brigades went into action to support a tired British division.  This brigade, like the other two west of Albert, met heavier fighting than the third division, especially at Albert, where it was called upon to withstand heavy German massed assaults, especially in the great battle of Dernancourt on April 5, when, after an all-day fight, they threw back the storming German divisions.</p>
<p>April 4 and 5 were days which will long live in the history of Australian arms &ndash; the days when the Germans tried their utmost, with what forces remained with them, to hack a way through to Amiens.  On April 4 efforts were made south of the Somme against Villers and Vretonneux, when the British cavalry and New South Wales battalions fought tooth and nail an heroic battle against odds.  The flanks were consistently hard pressed, and the town itself, the centre of their position, was deluged with shell fire.  Nevertheless, giving ground only by inches, and repeatedly counter-attacking, they finally saved the position, after 18 hours fighting.</p>
<p>[Newspaper cutting]<br/>Jerilderie Herald<br/>April 1918<br/>Roll of Honour<br/>The sad news was received by Mrs W. Elliott on Wednesday that her nephew, Major Terence Garling, A.F.A. had been killed in action in France.  The deceased hero had been closely associate with Lieutenant M. Fergusson (son of Mr and Mrs E. Fergusson of Jerilderie).  Both left Australia together and had been comrades in the fighting line ever [since].  In his letters to friends here Lieut. Fergusson repeatedly referred in terms of admiration and affection to Major Garling's excellent qualities.  He was the idol of his men and was beloved by his fellow officers.  The Major left with the first contingent in 1914.  He was badly gassed a few months ago and had only returned to duty in January last.  He was one of two sons, his brother being about to leave on active service.<br/>[Maurice A. Fergusson]<br/>[Newspaper cutting]<br/>Mirror<br/>Friday 3/May/18<br/>Major Garling Killed.<br/>Sergt. Garling, of Wagga, has received news of the death of his brother, Major Garling, killed in action last week.  He left with the first battery of the A.F.A. as a second-lieutenant.  He went through Gallipoli, was twice gassed in France, and had a close call on the second occasion.  While recovering in England he was offered a safe appointment on the staff.  His reply was Australian: "I came here to fight".  Major Garling was 24 years old, and had ranked Major for the past year and a half.</p>
