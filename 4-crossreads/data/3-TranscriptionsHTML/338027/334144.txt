<p>Friday, 5 March, 1915<br/>Spent all morning cleaning and polishing saddlery and ourselves for a big inspection of the 4th field ambulance and us by General Williams D.M.O.  We turned out in splendid order at two p.m and were firstly inspected in front of our parade ground.  Then we marched through Heliopolis to the Palace Hotel &ndash; the base hospital then back to the camp where we were dismissed only to learn that the division was to have a night attack in the desert and that we would have to go out at 10.30 p.m. in full marching order.  We snatched an hours sleep and when the boot and saddle call went at 10.15, each man dressed and saddled his horse without a word.  As we marched we were not allowed to smoke or talk and as the long army wound its way into the desert<br/>the only noise was the dull rumble of the artillery and perhaps the rattle of a horses accoutrements.  It was splendidly done and it was awesome and inspiring to watch.  Eventually the ambulance halted and we picketed our horses to the waggons and there we stayed till morning.  It was bitterly cold and we had no blankets save our great coats.  Sleep was impossible owing to the extreme cold and we were all glad to break camp as a heavy fog came up.  We returned to camp just before reveille, cold hungry and tired but not despaired for as soon as we were dismissed there were shouts of  "are we downhearted accompanied by the answer "no".  The horses were just as pleased to get home as we were and showed it by neighing loudly.</p>
