<p>WEDNESDAY, JULY 9, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine, but a bit cold. Jo drove me to</p>
<p>Pat Hurley&#39;s &amp; I met Eric &amp; Barney</p>
<p>Perkins there. I inspected 360 wether X</p>
<p>bred hoggets there &amp; bought them. Went</p>
<p>on to Barney&#39;s place on Round Island</p>
<p>&amp; inspected &amp; bought about 280 ewes</p>
<p>&amp; 155 wethers. Went on to Kickerbill</p>
<p>then, &amp; Jo brought me home. Saw</p>
<p>the Mackays &amp; Sy &amp; Laurence&nbsp;&amp; Grey</p>
<p>from Cattle Creek at Kickerbill.</p>
<p>Tickle round the Mountain and</p>
<p>at the fence at Boundary</p>
<p>well</p>
