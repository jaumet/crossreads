Gas again, bad in C.22. One man very bad with it. Tapping alleged to be heard under us, perhaps Abdul working away Some of them were wandering about outside their trenches, and great confabulation was heard. About 2000, some good shots being put in by cruiser. Some wind and rain. Expect Imbros expedition will be postponed again Bed 2030. Read for a while. Bullet planked right inside and buried into the limestone near bed

Bad with dysentery. Chilly after during stand to. Turks tapping heard right under our trenches. Siege battery shook up Johnston's Jolly landing shells in trench apparently used as cooking place. A lovely fresh morning the sea dark blue and white crested. Imbros showing up very plain. Everything clearest.
