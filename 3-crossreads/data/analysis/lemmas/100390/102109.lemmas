 I hope so . I want a chang of work . Im write this lie in deep cool grass full of buttercup , around me the hedg full of hawthorn bloom and the blossom of the appl tree fall over me . A thrush is pipe his even song and across the field come that most beauti note of the cuckoo . Over in the big barn where we live , alon clamour the raucous strident note of Australia , the voic of my comrad in arm wrangl over some petti thing or other . And ever again deep underton the roar of the German gun . At time like gigant surf on some beach of iron I send you my thank and all my love Your affection Jack
