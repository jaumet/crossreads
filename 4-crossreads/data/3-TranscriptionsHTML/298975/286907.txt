<p>June 16 1917 Saturday<br/>At 2 am Coffee &amp; biscuits were turned on &amp; soon afterwards we turned out the roll called &amp; we were of on the old trip Liverpool to Sydney &ndash; How long before any of us would take that trip again.</p>
<p>We lined up at Sydney as the day broke for the march to the boat but it was not a success from a Military point of view. There was a big crowed to see us off mostly girlies &amp; of course we were all mixed up. There was no delay at the Barier &amp; by 7 AM we were all aboard the trooper A72 (Beltana)</p>
