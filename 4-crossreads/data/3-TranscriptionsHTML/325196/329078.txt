<p>3-1-16<br/>Mon 3rd<br/>My absence was not missed again last night; This morning we had a kit inspection, &amp; received some more equipment; Les &amp; Reid had to go on duty at the orderly room for a while at dinner time as both the sigs on duty were away on messages &amp; as the parade was  a mounted one this afternoon, &amp; it was raining a little, I decided to make myself scarce rather than get wet, so I went down to the Billiard room &amp; played billiards all the afternoon, &amp; got back to camp soon after six oclock had a feed of tinned pineapple &amp; put the rest of the evening in writing in the mess room; again my absence was not noticed</p>
