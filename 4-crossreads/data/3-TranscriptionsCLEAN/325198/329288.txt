  
 23 April, 1916 Hill 70  Kantara We packed up & got a move on about 12 noon & got down near Kantara at dark - here we had tea & moved off again at 9.30 pm crossed the Suez Canal & went along a good road to a camp 6 or 7 miles out - it was 2 oclock when we crawled into blankets spurs & all, dead beat.
