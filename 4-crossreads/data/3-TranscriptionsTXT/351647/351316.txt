six weeks I've had four letters, 1 from Jim, 1 from a little niece & one from you & one from Mother.  Wouldn't it make you feel hopeless.  I'm not blaming you as I know you write but don't jump on me when you write.  Poor old Isabel I wonder what she'll do.  I only wrote to Jim the day before yesterday & he would be dead then.
Glad the season is being fair, I've been wondering about it & the paper said there had been rain.  I wonder if the book came home to London & who is publishing it.  I'm dying to read it.  Did I tell you I was trying to get to Paris next month but I don't care a damn now & must try & arrange to get out of this place & into something more settled & civilised for the winter.  I don't feel I could stand another winter like the last.
Thanks for the Cook's application which really was rather a pearl.
I'm sorry to hear Tom E. is playing up.  It is rotten for Mrs. Kathryn & like you I hope Jock will return before long & sort things out.
The Hay races must have been jolly.
