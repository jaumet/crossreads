<p>23 January 1916 Sun<br/>Being the Sabbath &ndash; church held on the desert very hot. Visions of large glasses of beer &amp; ginger ale. Had the afternoon off which was spent playing bluff poker lost as usual. Letter from Harry Fay received. Wrote to Joyce Walters. Bellemey very dry.</p>
<p>24 January 1916 Mon<br/>Stretcher-drill all the morning. Enough to break a man's heart trudging through the sand. Route march in the afternoon to the old trenches of Tel-el-Kebir. Short lecture by Major Moseley &amp; Captain Frizell. Went to the canteen with two-speed Murphy who shouted two bottles of beer. Wrote to Maude Griffiths &amp; Joyce Ross.</p>
