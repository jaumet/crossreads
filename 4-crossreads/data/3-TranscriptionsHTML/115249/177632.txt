<p>Naval Signal</p>
<p>From - Grantala</p>
<p>To - Berrima</p>
<p>Date - 18/9/14</p>
<p>Time - 6.15</p>
<p>Reply from [&quot;P.&quot; ?] M.O. Shall be glad to extend an invitation to any of you officers at any time. Signal was made owing to the fact that several batches of soldiers have been onboard during the last 2 days from sheer curiosity &amp; to see no one in particular I understood they belong to berrima</p>
