We are lined up on the road 6.30 I am in a section of 8 including an N.C.O and marched out of this old city by the ? Road through the old fort out onto the Battlefield in single file at 3 pases interval along the duck boards the frost makes them very slippery to walk on, we are halted by the officer leading us; to stand or sit down perfectly still and not look up, as there is a fleet of gothers enemy flying bombers overhead but they drop no bombs near us and we move on again along past countless shell holes
