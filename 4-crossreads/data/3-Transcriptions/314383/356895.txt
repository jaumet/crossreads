<p>June 29th<br/>Quite an exciting day.  Took my little lady to the Bazaar this afternoon in order to buy her some shoes &amp; some material for dresses which the lady of the house promises to make up.  Spent about an hour in the bazaar in buying shoes, material &amp; beads &amp; was just making out when a mob of Persians with the Commissioner of Police at their head rushed along and surround me.  He gabbled off 60 to the minute about taking a Mohammadan woman thro a public bazaar.  I could see that things were thick so told him to come along to his office while we sent for the Interpreter who came along.  The position was that I have unwittingly <strike>done an</strike>committed an awful crime in taking a woman of Persia (aged 12) thro the bazaar in broad daylight &amp; bought presents</p>
