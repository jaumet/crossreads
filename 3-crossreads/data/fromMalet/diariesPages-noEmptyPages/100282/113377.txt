7th. My Paris leave came through last night, so this morning I have been getting ready etc. I don't know what they will think of my eyes for they both look very suspicious, guess they will say, Keep your eye on this young waster for he looks a bit of a roughien, he might get you into trouble, but I am going all the same for I don't want to miss this chance of seeing the gay city.
In the afternoon I went along got my "pass" then went on to Somer about 3 miles off drew my money from the "Divvy" Paymaster after that went into a restaurant had some tea (steak potatoes coffee bread butter) not wonderfully appetising but filling.
The first part of our Battalion sports were held this afternoon, the weather was not too favourable the ground very slippery a nasty mist was falling, the short spell of frost seems to be broken. 
After all our planning scheming Jack could not get away with me, although his "pass" is laying in our Orderly Room
