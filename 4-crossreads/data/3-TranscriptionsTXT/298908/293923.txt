14th.  Very dull & cloudy today.  Sports are being held on the for'rard deck this afternoon, the skipping competition was the main one they had to skip at the rate of a 100 per minute & were allowed 2 breaks, there was the usual rivalry between Victoria & New South Wales over it, but the former won amidst great applause, a chap named Wells put up 2323 against the next mans 1787 not bad going.There is trouble on our ship with the fireman they are demanding better food & until they get it they won't work hard, consequently for the last 24 hours our ship has been going at a snail's pace.  I don't know how it is going to end, the men can't refuse to work but they make it that crook that the boilers have hardly enough steam to push the ship along.  I don't know how far their claim is justified, they reckon their food is not nearly as good
