Dear Mother
Today I received another letter from you the one with enclosure from Harry, also my Photo. I dont think that I will send it to the Fair Lassie in W.A. "Who by the way happens to be dark, and is a nice girl judging by her letters and Photo which she sent me. it reached me when we were at Bovington I had some Photos taken here a couple of weeks back but was dissappointed with the Result so I am having some more taken as soon as Possible. They cost me 3/6 per doz. P.C. size. I have been holding my cash so that I would have some when I got my four days leave. I have applied for 4 days at Xmas. "I think that I will get it all right I hope so anyway, I heard from Mrs. Horton again today, She is very anxious for me to go up and stay with them for awhile in fact as long as I like, but the Military Authorities have a say there, and it is not what I would like, however if they do not give me a fairer deal than they have given some of the others, I will make a bid for a holiday, some of our boys are away now, and they are likely to be away
