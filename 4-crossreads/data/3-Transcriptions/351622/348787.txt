<p>26 February 1916 Sat<br/>Went stone, penniless broke last night playing banker. Steve breaks the bank. C Section leaves the 5th Field Ambulance for ever &amp; goes to make up 15th Field Am. Digging operations again during morning. Afternoon off spent in a sun bath on the sand. Getting very brown.</p>
<p>27 February 1916 Sun<br/>Quartermasters fatigue. Terrible hot to day. Wrote &amp; sent photoes to Harry, Roy, Sugar, Mary &amp; home. Water still scarce what would we give for a dip in the surf at Bondi now. Dicky Smart came &amp; had dinner with us. Met Fatty Weston who came in sick. Letter received from Thelma Smith. She seems a decent sort or sport I should say.</p>
