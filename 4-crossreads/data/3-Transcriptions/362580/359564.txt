<p>dreadfully sorry for them.  He is such a nice, clever boy &amp; has had so many drawbacks.  It is a pity they have no more children.</p>
<p>I got a dreadful shock to hear of Mrs. Weir's death.  It is very, very sad to think that two young mothers have left each a little family of 5 children.  Funny they lived next door to each other.  Terang will be a very sad place.</p>
<p>I'm so pleased to hear that you are all better from the Influenza.  See that you all take care of yourselves &amp; not get fresh colds.  I had such a number of letters from my Vic. friends.</p>
<p>Ethel's &amp; Miss Dot. Swinburne's came on Friday &ndash; Ella &amp; Doll's, Emma's, Mrs. Osburne's &amp; Miss Newland's I got Monday afternoon.  It will just tell you how the mails are sorted here.</p>
<p>Thank you Al. for good-wishes &amp; your letter arrived the day after my birthday.  I'm glad to hear all my debts have been settled &ndash; now I hope Belle will, fix up the money for the birthday presents</p>
