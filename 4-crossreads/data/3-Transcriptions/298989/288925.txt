<p>27/12/15<br/>Very sloppy after rain in early hours but sun came out later and on parade became so hot that after lunch my cardigan jacket is going to be shed. Section drill with arms &ndash; all very rusty officers &amp; N.C.O's weak in word of command. Am holding a class this afternoon in communication drill for non coms.</p>
<p>Doctor imshied to hospital this morning with quinsy. He has worked hard ever since leaving Melbourne. Dr. Craig took over in lieu. Quiet night.</p>
<p>28/12/15<br/>Morning sunny after a lovely sunrise. Took N.C.O's for a class and gave them practice in communication drill. Some people further up are striking camp. Our regimental bugle call cut down to one call.</p>
<p>After lunch went an 8 mile route march passed through Kundia but at foot of rocky hills all houses loopholed with the holes plugged up with pebbles. The upper story loopholed as well. The church decorated with quite elegant stonework, all the kids in school. Not as clean a place as Tenedos, in fact the people and village on Lemnos are not as clean as might be. There seems to be a strain of Turk. Most of the better looking girls are said to be collared by periodic incursions for the harems of the Ottoman, the mixed race is perhaps the fruit of the rapine of invasions. Good open country between the foothills most of it lying fallow. The oxen &amp; crude wooden plough are everywhere in use. Under the bright sun &amp; cool wind the green countryside appears most agreeable.</p>
<p>Brigadier says today we may be here another week yet. Also reported two of 21st. were fired on yesterday in Kondia. The place is dirty enough to be half Turk. We sent 100 men down from Brigade and they brought our mail up. Great bustle in Camp and talking and laughing. Allowed some latitude regarding lights out.</p>
