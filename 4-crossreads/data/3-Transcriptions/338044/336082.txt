<p>1st Oct 1915 &ndash; Lovely weather at sea. Plenty of Albatross. Passed another "shire" boat. ["Ayreshire" is inserted here in pencil later] Saw a couple of whales. Our chief annoyance is having no place to sleep. No decent arrangements for the A.M.C. Slept on deck this night.  Reveille at 6 am    &amp;  it made no difference to the boys, who are so tired. However we are soon made to move by the deck cleaners with a big hose. Excitement    &amp;  a lot of speculation is aboard as to whether we are to put into Melbourne next day.</p>
<p>The calm weather gives place to a strong breeze with a promise of a rough sea. Man fell down the hold near wet canteen &amp;  we carried him to hospital. Another man cut foot awfully with razor. Several stitches put in    &amp;  sent to bed</p>
