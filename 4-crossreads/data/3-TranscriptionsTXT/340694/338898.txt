1322/5/16.Very quiet day to-day. Have just been across to the Coy & the lads are all going through their kit bags. We are only allowed to take 1 bag with us & consequently the kit has to be reduced. I've made arrangements to sneak a few extras away in a stationery box. Everything points to a speedy departure.
25/5/16.Very busy these last few days nothing but the General Routine has happened. Marching out states & Embarkation Rolls are the order of the day.
26/5/16.Went for a swim with Dud Otton this afternoon it was great. To-night The Colonel lectured us on our departure & warned us not to be absent when wanted & told us the penalty.
