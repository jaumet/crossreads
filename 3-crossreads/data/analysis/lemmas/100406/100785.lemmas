 Crane for today at ani rate give us a lot of unnecessari work overtim . They have note here of all valu from one Halfpenni upward . Some are issu by villag Syndic , these latter look like Bus ticket but are about 1" x 1" in size . Saturday , 21/12 Had anoth afternoon as Crane Driver . Our Tucker here is somewhat scanti even now . It seem that Fritz blew up bridg , Railway Road to such an extent that it is veri difficult to get the food up . The peopl here on the French side of the Frontier have n't a darn thing . But if one walk up the street about a K.M. or 2 ( on the Belgian side of the Frontier ) one find Estaminet open , Fair Beer at the French price for Bad Beer . Plenti of Lolli , mechan Piano Danc in the Estaminet ( Mdmlles too ) . The French tell me they ca n't get even Bad Beer . A Kgrmme . of coffe cost 38 Franc , no sugar , no anyth . But the Belgian seem to have plenti . I?d like to know whi I weigh 11 stone today . Monday , 23/12 Among the gear salvag are a number of small Gener direct connect to what look like a small mech . motor with an interrupt devic in the Gener circuit . I believ these are Dynamo for small wireless set . They are wound up by a crank then let go like a clockwork toy . I will probabl have more to say about them later on . One fair size Dynamo here has Graphit Brush . Mac 's letter .
