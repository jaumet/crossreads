<p>more than the tug of the reins.<br/>Most of their harvesting is done by hand. I have only seen one reaping machine in the district. They are threshing wheat in the farm opposite. The machine is worked by a horse walking up a revolving pathway, like a tread-mill, it's weight keeping the thing going. The horse goes straight ahead all the time and the flooring moves underneath it. The part it walks on is just like a ship's gangway and is only just a horse length, so that if it (the horse) stops going it will be thrown against the rails at the back.<br/>All the arrangements in the farms hereabouts are very old fashioned. Most of the farms have a large wooden wheel at the side standing about as high as the wall. A large dog runs around on the bottom edge of the wheel, which is about two feet broad, and as it is revolved by his weight it turns a barrel inside the room which churns butter.<br/>Every farm is self- supporting although the houses are only a stones-throw from one another. They grow all their own fruit and vegetables, bake their own bread in large brick ovens which are let into the house, make their own butter, and each one has plenty of fowls which supply them with eggs. The latter form their main article of diet and they seldom eat meat. I have not seen any used in the farm whilst I have been here.<br/>Each farm has cellars well stocked with cider, sour, dry white wine and french beer (which is more like bad water than liquor). This and coffee with cognac form their main drinks.<br/>You will be glad to hear that I am putting on weight under these ideal conditions and also in all probability we will be here for some time. Jack and I got rather a shock yesterday when the two companies billeted here received orders to rejoin the rest of the battalion in the next village. We almost shed tears at the prospect of leaving our comfortable quarters but luckily for us the orders were cancelled at the last minute.<br/>I received a letter from Stirling yesterday. He has very little news and like me, mentions the fact the the Australian mail has turned dog on us.</p>
