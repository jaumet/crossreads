 At Beutin Paid forty francs today by Redmond, in the Local Estaminet Du Gare, the old Madame [indecipherable] is rubbing her hands and waiting till six pm when she will gather numerous francs in return for beer and etc. James was just a little "oiled" not too bad.  Weather cold but fine. Went to rendezvous and played cards in the evening.
