<p>The phases of a Soldiers life. A.M.C.<br/>All the Corps a circus and all the N.C.O's &amp; men merely players.  They have their exits &amp; their entrances and a man in his time plays many parts.  First the private growling &amp; grumbling about tucker &amp; work.  Then the glorified private with a little more of dog &amp; a brand new stripe.  The Corporal lying on his back in waggon or pack store waiting the opportunity to sneak into the Sgts mess.  Next the duty Sgts who with voice severe &amp; harsh roars up the men on parade. Then the Staff Sgts who with  bottle &amp; measure in hand distributes [indecipherable] to the unfortunate patients.  Then the N.O. who with longing eyes looks for stars in the Q.M.'s shoes.  The scene then shifts to the officers mess where colonels severe, majors shrewd &amp; Captains new do congregate to talk of veins &amp; hearts &amp; operations delicate, of horses, tents, poisons &amp; purgatives for all to take.  The next scene is the Q.M.'s store where Q.M. shrewd is heard to roar at privates about the clothes they wore &amp; tucker they do not get.  The next act is the orderly room where the Colonel sits in uniforms so neat with eyes severe &amp; frown so deep he doth censure &amp; sentence as the case is proved.  Last of all comes the end to this eventful career sans leave, sans girls, sans bar, sans everything.</p>
