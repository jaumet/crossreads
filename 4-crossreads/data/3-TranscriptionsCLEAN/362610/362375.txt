  
 Thursday 8 June 1916 A lovely day. Bayonet fighting before breakfast & use of bombs at the morning & afternoon parades. In between times got 2 or 3 letters off. School visited by the Premier of Q'nsland, General Birdwood & others. We did not see them but heard afterwards that during an exhibition with trench mortars there was very nearly an accident with serious results.
