30/4/18 Lavieville
During the morning an English Colonel 21st London Regt. and some of his officers came up to make a reconnaisance with a view to our relief here tomorrow night. Took Thewlis and went around all the companies. Things were extremely quiet and during the whole of our journey we only had one shell near us. Found Colonel Duggan in his new big dugout under the road and stayed there talking for a while. Coming back topping the rise above Lavieville one gets a splendid view of Henencourt to Millencourt and over towards Warloy. Pleasant mild country this. The villages are rarely more than a kilometre or two apart and not a fence is to be seen anywhere. It only wanted the civilian life about to make believe that there was no War on but everything is absolutely deserted. Even the troops have to lie low and cling to the security of their trenches. Late in the afternoon we received an order regarding our move and Mills and Bourke together with Sutherland came in to get instructions. We live only from day to day and have no knowledge of what our movements shall be after Warloy. Most likely we shall be en route for Querrieu very few hours after we march in. At dark walked up and inspected the Coys at stand to arms. All standing equipped in their trenches waiting. One Hun battery was throwing over a few shells from an emplacement at the rear of Albert. Otherwise quiet complete reigned on the whole of the front. The smell of damp earth filled a quiet spring twilight.
