Between times I have accomplished absolutely nothing from a military point of view but in every moral sense I am better.The training I had with the 16th has done me good physically, & the difficulties & oppositions followed by failures, have made me more determined, less egotistical, more humble & generally far better.Am marked A Class & expect to leave in next draft (first for 6 weeks & more) for France.Better luck in the future!Nil desperandum.
