<p>Transports already there.  We dropped anchor in the Stream at 1.30 pm &amp; then began a scene that will always remain impressed on my mind.  We anchored alongside 10 other Transports &amp; each one gave us a rousing reception.  You could hear the Coo'ees going for fully an hour, &amp; which sounded very strange in an Egyptian Harbour.<br/>The Canal is about &frac12; a mile from where we lie &amp; is guarded by a fleet of 6 War Ships &amp; some further up in the wide parts.<br/>The Egyptian's are sailing round &amp; round us in their little Sailing boats begging for pennies &amp; bai jove they can cadge.  All the fellows are throwing them money to see them dive after them.</p>
<p>From where we lay you can see the Town of Suez &amp; it has some wonderful buildings in it of which I will speak later on when I see them closer.<br/>It is strange to see the boats coming through the Canal.  Not being able to see the water you would think that the Boats were sailing through land.  We have the Yellow Flag flying (fever) but as yet I don't know whether we are to be quarinetined.
