<p>6 &ndash; joined the army &ndash; "confined to Barracks" is one.<br/>I was very sorry I did not get to Castos. I had the garry one day and everything arranged &ndash; and no leave was given owing to the expecting imediate orders to move. This is a boring letter &ndash; tomorrow I shall be at Alexandria 10am 22. Jan 1916 &ndash;<br/>We are having a lovely smooth trip &ndash; and it is much warmer now.<br/>Much love to you all &ndash; I long for letters and hope you will write me often &ndash; all your news. I expect I shall get some tomorrow &ndash; as our mail has been kept in Alexandria &ndash; also that all the parcels that have been sent me will be there.<br/>Always your devoted daughter &amp; sister<br/>FMcMillan<br/>I am glad about Sir George Reid<br/>I have not heard from Mother since 2 Nov - &amp; the girls the 7th Nov &ndash; so I really know nothing about you all.</p>
