Am writing this tonight in the Y.M.C.A. a concert is in progress so I am having a little difficulty in keeping things in my mind. 5 of our Coy. went on leave tonight they have just come out of the line.
13th. Got my marching orders for School this morning, so this afternoon I set off for Bailleul where I had to report on the morning of the 14th at 6.30 AM to Lieut Hawkins I was supposed to stop at the Rest station tonight but I couldn't see my way clear to do a perish down there while I could get tons of blankets at our Battalion store, so that's where I pulled up, during the afternoon I went and saw the cinema show to put a little of my spare time in, old Fritz
