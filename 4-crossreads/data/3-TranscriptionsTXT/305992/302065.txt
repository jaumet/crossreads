 Good news received this day by wireless previous to arrival of Bulgaria surrendering unconditionally. On arrival we heard that Bulgaria had given up all her railway stores to the Allies. 5 pm finished coaling ship &amp; weighed anchor in charge of a pilot &amp; departed for Basra Persian Gulf. 6 pm the pilot left, so proceeded at regulation speed for our distenation. 
 3.10.18 Fine weather prevailed the temperature have gone down to 82&deg;. We passed one solitary patrol man of war &amp; steamed at night without our regulation lights. But otherwise dim lights allowed to be used in the different accomodations, the idea being so as to evade raiders &amp; prevent same from seeing us for any distance at night, as our regulation mast head lights are visible about 12 miles. 
 4.10.18 We are steaming about parerall with the land &amp; about 60 miles off so that the land is out of sight &amp; the idea being to keep well out so as to be always in a depth of water above 600 feet deep at least.
