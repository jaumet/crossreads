<p>My dear Judge,<br/>I don't remember whether I have written to you since I took over this Battalion (2 less than the old one) Times are very strenuous but everything here with us is going on well. I have had to work very hard to get hold of things &amp; found it rather a refreshing change because recently in the old Bn under the new C.O. I was bored with lack of work.</p>
<p>Last night I got about 10 hours glorious sleep the first decent sleep for 5 nights and am feeling just a bit dopey this morning in consequence. Today everything has been quiet except when an occasional Bosche comes over &amp; drops bombs when immediately every Archie and Machine Gun proceeds to plaster the sky for miles round. There is one Bosche over at the present time but they seldom do any damage in the forward areas.</p>
<p>The Padre has just come in to see me. I have</p>
