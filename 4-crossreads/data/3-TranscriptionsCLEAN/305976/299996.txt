  
 will soon be nobody left Thursday Ap 11 Turks made an attack to day across Flat. They advanced in close formation & we waited until they were practically up to wire before fire. The Artillery let fly putting a barrage at back of them preventing them from getting away. They were machine Gunned in front & shelled from behind & were repulsed with very heavy losses. Friday  Ap 12 Another Bomb raid this morning. Turks have retired back into the Hills of Moab after their bad mauling yesterday. It is hot here
