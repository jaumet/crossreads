 It is a treat to ride a decent horse again after the half drafts at the Cavalry School. Owing to the sand our horses have all learned to walk fast. I suppose its trying to keep up to the fast walkers &amp; not trot, but no Wesminster is equal to the old horses for sale. 
 All day &amp; night freight trains go bye loaded up with forage &amp; Bully Beef &amp; Biscuits &amp; in the Bay or such as it is, are many boats unloading stores for the Army. You might think we talk a lot about the war, but I'm afraid Officers &amp; man's chief topic of conversation is Girls &amp; their tucker. Read "A Wife out of EGYPT" by  Douglas Siddern  MISS LORIMER (it is good).
