<p>V.O in charge of Base Hospital. Some very sarcastic remarks passed by Capt Young, about horses turned out as cured from Vet hospital. Capt Stewart picked him up instantly, and told him that a certain horse should have a bullet in him, If he could not do it, to send it down to the hospital, and he would damn soon do it.<br/>Just heard that the result of the bombardment was good. We captured a trench with scarsely any opposition, simply walked into it. We actually massacred the Turks. Further reports say we captured two trenches, Our casualties were one killed and one wounded.<br/>17/11/1915<br/>Counter attacks last night by the Turks 7 in all. Our Artillery firing from 9 P.M. till 11 P.M. very rapid.<br/>The weather today is cold and miserable. The Turks were repulsed each time with heavy losses. Our bomb makers are working overtime. We are rushing every available bomb thrower up to the trenches, a lot of infantry are also being sent up. A peculiar thing all these moves happened just after Kitcheners visit. He must have livened</p>
