<p>Dear Miss King</p>
<p>Just a few lines letting you know I have rejoined my unit again from furlough and to my surprise when I got back there was your parcel waiting for me.</p>
<p>Thanks so much Miss King for your kindness during the last three years, I am sure I shall never forget you. The Buttons of the Australian Red Cross Day and of Capt Car is very good and I am keeping them as Souvenirs.</p>
<p>Well we are having a bit of a rest at present and by the news we have received the last few days, looks like if</p>
