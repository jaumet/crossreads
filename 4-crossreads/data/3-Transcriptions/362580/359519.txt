<p>dear old Charlie Copp.  He is a brave boy, wanting to go to the firing line again.  Wish this dreadful war would end before any more of our great fellows are maimed or killed.  Things are looking very serious but I must not say anything I should'nt, as I shall be on   <u>my honor</u>, not having this censored.  I see dear old Consie Murray nearly every day for a few minutes but we are off duty at different times, to our sorrow.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that Nellie sent me an awfully nice letter again, with two pretty handkers enclosed.  I also received two awfully pretty ones from Glory &amp; King with a little note from Glory, so my relations are very fond of me now I'm at the war &ndash; but I can tell you I do appreciate their kindness &ndash; blood is thicker than water &ndash; after all.  I'm really glad of my warm nighties now &amp; singlets.  The one you sent me washes very well, I do that myself &amp; stockings.</p>
