31-12-16is 12 miles from Rafa which is reported to be occupied by 3 Btn of Infantry, 1 battery of Artillery & 1 Regt of Cavalry. It was showery all last night & cloudy this morning but no rain & had a decent trip home to El Arish arriving here 3.30; After having a snack I rode over to B.H.Q. & saw[x1] Capt Hudson (Bde Capt) in reference to my application for leave which was returned to me this morning saying I could only be granted 3 days, I can get leave but am leaving it stand till Lieut Kater returns the day after tomorrow from Port Said; Laid another line back to the Regt as we have been having trouble with the old one. Had enough cake to last us through the trip as I got 4 parcels on the 29th
