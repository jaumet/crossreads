  
 & a view that covers city & forest. 
 About 7 pm I return to meet Hendy [CMJ] Hotel Continental (expense (1500 to 2000 for 15 days) & have an oporto, accompany him to his room & then find I am too late to get dinner in my old haunts. 
 I choose an American grill room at the cheapest looking place hereabout. When I enter the lady in charge shakes hands. This seems ominous. I have chicken & rice & bread & cheese, no wine only water Bill 8.50 fr + 80 fr tip - Ice cream costs 3 fr Salmon Mayonaise 7.50. Such is the price one pays in the city. It is a big expenditure for me if I desire to return to England & purchase some clothes. 
 6-7-19 Can get to sleep till nearly 4 At 5 am some mad singing enthusiast commence his practices. A funeral goes by then morning most of the mourners are in their ordinary working dress. Some appear to have just quitted their work & without changing joined up This absence of dress is very noticeable especially when going for an evening stroll round about home. 
 Tonight I dined with Mde Brisson. Soup Vermicelli fish & lobster, beef - beans - cheese & cream - fruit with wine & coffee & yet these are poor people After dinner we talked & I left fairly early for I am not in best of health
