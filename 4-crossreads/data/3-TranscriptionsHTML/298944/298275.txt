<p>Sunday night</p>
<p>Got through most of my correspondence last night.</p>
<p>Today has been very successful but I got a very small amount of sleep &amp; feel consequently, rather sleepy tonight.</p>
<p>Odd jobs before going to bed - overtime (about 10.30) &amp; called prematurely early to receive &amp; play for a big dry singer of the 1st Field &ndash; Sgt Sellars &ndash; who is to help us next Thursday.</p>
<p>Beautiful weather today, &amp; I was</p>
