  
 The British White Ensign & French flags are flying on all the forts & government buildings.  It makes one sad & gloomy to gase & think how many thousands of lives were lost at this partecular spot a few years ago.  A few hundred yards above The Narrows, which is only about 2 miles wide is seen the mine field & nets used by the Turks against our ships of war & submarines.  After passing through the entrance of the minefield our escort & leading destroyer left us & wished us a Merry Xmas.  We proceeded on our own up the Dardanells & up the Sea of Marmara & arrived off Constantinople at 11 p.m. & dropped anchor for the night.  Fine weather prevailed rather cold.  Hills all covered with snow.  Temperature 48 mean average.  The British troops that we embarked on the night of the 24th it appears they were kept on the wharf awaiting a transport ferry to bring them off to the H.M.T. Indarra.  Whilst there for hours they dozens of them were very drunk & disorderly brought aboard in that state at 8 p.m.  Our Captain protested re leaving that night considering these men were in such condition & in the event of anything happening useless to serve out lifebelts & no boat drill & send a letter ashore to the General Head Military Quaters & also to the D.M.T.O. for further instruction.  The Signal came back by Morse to carry on & proceed to sea immediately to the disgust of all sensable persons aboard. 
 25.12.18 10 a.m.  Shifted our position & anchored near a line of Battle Ships & cruisers & torpedoe boats 1/2 a mile from the Centre of the City.
