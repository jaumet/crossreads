  
 Bayoud Thur 25 Jan Last night went on gaurd.  Col came home late roaring a treat & overheard him say  that we were to shift.  To day things moved some.  Men have already left for Hassaniya & we are to move tomorrow morning.  A Reg of Yeomanry & 3 sects Camel corps are releiving us, twice as many men to do the work as we have. 
 Wed 31st Jan 17  Hassaniya Since Sunday we have been here, three windy sandy days.  I have got a bosker bivvy though & can defy wind rain or sand;  We were supposed to stop here for several weeks but word came through to day that we are shifting again on Friday to out post El Arish
