<p>number of high velocity shells this morning, some of them went right over our camp in the direction of Steinmerck, and I heard to night that they fell around the railway station there.<br/>Some fell east of our camp, probably in search of dumps.<br/>[Shorthand Not Transcribed]<br/>I received 2 "Southern Cross" tonight bearing a Merino Post mark, probably from Annie.<br/>Sunday Feb. 17. 1918. 1294.<br/>There was another heavy frost last night. To day is fine but cold. The sky is bright &amp; clear. There was the usual half holiday today. I finished making a jug for Cliff Thomson today. I made a few days ago a flower vause for Harry Mc Donald. Both the jug &amp; the vause I made out of 18 pounder brass shell cases.<br/>I finished reading a book "Broken Road" by A.E.W. Mason, a readable story of Indian life. It is a tale of an English man &amp; an Indian Prince who were both educated in England and who as boys were great friends but later in life were enemies. The object of the book is to show that educating Indian princes in England makes them dissatisfied with their own people and unhappy because of racial distinction.<br/>Monday Feb. 18. 1918 -1295.<br/>Cold &amp; frosty last night the ice is over an inch thick.<br/>I am fitting new brake blocks</p>
