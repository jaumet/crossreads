19th Had a bad accident out on parade this morning, every man in the Battalion was supposed to throw a live bomb. C Coy had just finished throwing D Coy had started everything went well for a while till by some unlucky accident they struck a bomb which was faulty just as it left the throwers hand it exploded killing three wounding 11 more some of them seriously, the bombing officer Lieut Dingle is as good as dead Scales a platoon officer is very badly hit, these "Mills" bombs of ours are very small innocent looking, but they are the deadliest things for their size I know of, this caused a bit of a flutter for a while, there was a great demand for sticking plaster
