<p>Sunday July 15th Con</p>
<p>two of the lads knocked out with bricks, &amp; about ten minor injuries. It was very exciting for about two hrs.</p>
<p>Monday July 16th<br/>The lad that they couldn't arrest last night, was duly arrested off the early morning parade this morning. He admits he is an out law, &amp; gave is career as such, viz 18 months in Darlinghurst, Sydney. 6 months in Long Bay. 6 weeks in Abbasia (Australian Military gaol) &amp; 8 weeks in a gaol at Isle of Wight, &amp; I suppose he will receive a big term for this. The Corporal M.P. was seriously wounded, &amp; as the mob says, served him right, as he was a rotter of the first class.</p>
<p>Tuesday July 17th<br/>I do very little work in the store now, as we are packing up a large lot of old unserviceable clothing &amp; equipment to go back to ordnance, it is a rotten job too, as some of the old clothes would nearly "stand up &amp; bark at you". You have to keep smoking to keep the smell down at times. Everything is very quiet after the riot. Rained during the day.</p>
