by quaint old fashioned farmhouses, red tiled and homely, and tiny little pastures and grain fields all bounded by rock piled walls. It made me feel a new being after the murky
atmosphere and confined life of London; especially as at the present time my health is not the best. 
During the day we must have covered 14 miles.
15th July Monday
With Mr Filmore to the crest of a high hill celled Danby Beacon, about 5 miles from "Home". There we stayed all day. He sketching and me loafing in the sun doing nothing but recuperate in the pure air - read Omar and watch the ever changing play of sunshine and shadow in the valleys or on the hills.
