Horses moving & transport etc.  Aeroplanes have been busy all day & we counted 16 shrapnel shells fired at one man all of which appeared to us to miss badly.  The Fort on the Cape is a mass of ruins, as is also several buildings in the vicinity.  We can plainly see the ship which was specially prepared & run ashore to assist in the landing of the troops.  Three large holes were cut in each side to allow of guns being used.  We have seen a dummy battleship known as H.M.S. Tiger No 2  She carries one genuine gun the rest being dummies  About midday the Turks commenced firing from the Asiatic side & one shell landed close to the camp but one of our guns replying, it was soon silenced.  Towards evening we disembarked the Hospital onto a mine sweeper & then returned to the old spot & anchored for the night all lights being muffled.

In the evening our Doctor & Ships Captain were taken off & various latrines were immediately floated.
