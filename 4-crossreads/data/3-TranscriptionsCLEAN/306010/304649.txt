 President - they doing quite a lot of public service including the running of French & Belgian soldiers, clubs, etc. Saw several members of some English women's Corps who wear Khaki uniforms & drive ambulances etc. Calais is a Belgian army base and the town & surrounding country is very active with their Troops & transport. We set out on our return journey by another route - 40 kilometres in length - & running round the coast the whole distance to Wimereux. Left Calais at 4.45 p.m. & taking it easy in view of the fact that we had to ride 25 miles & I had done no biking for nearly two years, rode through les Basaques, Sangatte, Escalles, Wissant, Tardinghen, Audinghen, Audreselles to Wimereux which we reached just before 8.30 p.m. The road was good
