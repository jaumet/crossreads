 (4/3) 
 5-65 for a pot of black tea &amp; a handfull of biscuits later we had a decent meal for 8-1 at a less stylish place. 
 Everyone behaved well as far as I saw.  Expected to hear more music.  Got to the train early to get a seat but it was about 1&frac12; hours late starting &amp; very slow when it did.  Whally is doing the cooking this week.
