General Walker was present. We had communion to follow in the School house on Monday evening. I distributed some cigarettes & writing paper to the men of the 2nd Bn and gave them an address on Egypt. They took a keen interest in it and listened attentively & one man moved a vote of thanks & it was carried by acclamation.I received word this week that I could return to Australia & that Pitendrigh would take my place with the first BrigadeI shall be sorry to leave\
