 October, 1915 Sunday 10 Church today &ndash; Service by a Yankee Evangelist who ranted away in a nasal voice which frightened the doves &amp; gazelles in the garden to the furthest corner. Sunday is not observed by the Egyptians &amp; I walked to a local mill in the village, where the natives bring their  corn  to be ground, also millet &amp; a little wheat carried in Baskets on a donkey, a portion is given to the Miller for grinding, all so primitive, yet alongside on a Macadamised load Motors were passing to &amp; from the Hospital. Did 2 miles longest walk to date.
