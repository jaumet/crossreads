<p>At 10pm we got back to the residency but as the crowd had not begun to muster we found our way into the grounds &amp; commandeered their lawn for resting purposes.Instead of shooing us off, the people from the house came out &amp; introduced themselves, also a party of poor devils returned from German East whom they are looking after. The native servants were all kept busy carrying out baskets of fruit &amp; most of us returned to the boat with a fair sized bunch of bananas. When the gunners mustered they must have got down on about a tone of these fruit - &amp; that's a low estimate. Mid night struck before we thought fit to get back to the Ark, we marched off in great style, but most of us landed at the point in rickshas. From the Point a multitude of launches took us to our ships. It was some carnival, I can tell you. Imagine the scene of troops of all creeds &amp; colors dumped at midnight on circular quay with only launches to transport them over the harbor. The sun was up  before all were off &amp; few of us got any sleep that night. Pulled out from the coaling Station at 10 am Tuesday &amp; lay in midstream until a few strays were rounded up &amp; brought aboard. As the police boat came alongside we got another laugh.One of the disreputables took it into his head to swim for liberty &amp; acted promptly on the idea.</p>
