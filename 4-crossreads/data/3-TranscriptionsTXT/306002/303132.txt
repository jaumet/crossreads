6.5.15Thur. 6th.  This morning we were busy greasing our saddles & packing them in bags getting ready to leave.  We heard to-day that we are to go to the Dardanelles & are to go into the firing line & the camp is in high spirits in anticipation of a scrap of with the Turks.  The Regiment was paraded before the Dr. to-day to see who was medically unfit to go, several lads were put into the reinforcement on account of having bad feet.  Am Cpl. of the feed party tonight.
