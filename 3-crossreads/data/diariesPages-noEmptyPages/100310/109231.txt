21/7/17 Beaulencourt
At 8am moved out to jumping off trenches between the Sugar Factory Le Transloy where the other battalions of the brigade met for the attack. With Rodda proceeded to Bde HQ to act as umpire. The attack launched at 9.15 against positions in the direction of Villers au Flos ? Haplincourt. Tanks were represented by hessian frames quite realistic in appearance made by the renowned Scotty Lang of 24th. They mopped up strong posts and sticky positions. The morning was nice and fresh and the view towards Haplincourt very charming ? rolling grass meadows and trim thick woods. The old chateau at Villers au Flos stands ruined in its grounds. after the operation we had a conference on the mistakes etc. At 4.30 the G. held a conference on training etc. General Wisdom called in. During the evening the doctor and myself had great French conversation with Leon Burbier and he was very amusing on religious topics the question of divorcing of the Church and State 10 years ago. A decent little fellow who knows the whole continent well and has kept his eyes open during his travels.
