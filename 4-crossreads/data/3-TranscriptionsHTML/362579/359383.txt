<p>Kelly as my room mate again. She is a most kind hearted girl but oh, gets on my nerves terribly   &amp;  has nothing in common with me. She is very miserable   &amp;  very run down, so perhaps she will get a move but really I've never struck anything so light in all my career on Active Service. Have quite a number of old pals so we do have some real jolly talks   &amp;  cup of tea in our rooms at night. Sister A. Kidd-Hart, whom I worked with in Officers Ward at Heliopolis   &amp;  Ismalia is Head Sister here but is still the near jolly girl. She comes to our room every night. We went to the village yesterday afternoon   &amp;  had afternoon tea, quite a happy time together. The Matron is a charming woman. Has   <strike>given me</strike>  put me in charge of two Wards (Surgical) with an excellent Staff. I'm a real lady now. Having the rest of my life. Don't suppose it</p>
