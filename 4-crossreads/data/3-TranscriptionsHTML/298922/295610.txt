<p>Wednesday 7th November 1917</p>
<p>Went Red X office &amp; A.I.F. Headquarters, it will take "wangling" to travel with Dolly as I am booked to leave on the 14 inst. with a draft.</p>
<p>Lunched at Australian Club, Piccadilly, quite a nice place. Aldy Isherwood &amp; wife are to arrive tonight at Berners Hotel where we are staying.</p>
<p>Slept well I'm glad to say.</p>
<p>Capt. ISHERWOOD is a year older than Dolly &amp; has a very pretty wife who I met in Egypt.</p>
