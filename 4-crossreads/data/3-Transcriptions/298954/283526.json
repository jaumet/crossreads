<p>Wed. 26th Sept (cont.)<br/>In another was a picturesque little group of Asiatic women.</p>
<p>A little old woman was sitting in a deck chair, squatting around her was a pretty little kimono-clad Jap. woman, a Chinese girl in blue trousers and a little child.</p>
<p>This group were smiling and placidly chattering in marked contrast to the English women.</p>
<p>An enormous number of men were squatting around, many kimono-clad, others in white.</p>
<p>We were allowed on deck at about 8 pm to find the "Wolf" steaming on a set course at full speed with her prize at the port quarter.</p>
<p>Before we came on to the poop a few corpses could be seen lying on no 3 hatch.   They were put over the side at about 7 pm.</p>
<p>Thur. 27th Sept.<br/>Another burial at 8 am.   Nerger attended himself, together with his and the Jap. officers.</p>
