  
 I have been struggling for forty eight hours to have it bought and at every turn I was stuck up by officers who have not yet learned that there is in existence a great war, Legge came in the nick of time, and I shall have it tomorrow, besides having the laugh upon those who would not do what I required. 
 No my dear, the lists we see are from the Australian papers, the great bulk of the people are not interested in Australian killed and wounded, but further the names are not allowed to be published, it is quite enough information to give to the Egyptian, to let him see our train loads of wounded coming in each day. 
 Dr Arthur in his letter told me that Larkin was not killed.   How strange if true?   Several men told me that they saw him dead?   The announcements in the paper will have been rather premature if he has not been killed.

If possible I get a few hours sleep during the afternoon, then I can stay in the office during the hours of the night, keep guard over my flock, write my letters or read that which I require.

My love to Maria, tell her to not be down hearted, there is lots of fun in the world and of it she makes a fair share.   What more can any one want than to be the cause for giving pleasure to others.  The war has moved much since you wrote.   The cables to day indicate tha Warsa[w] will fall in a few days.  Weight and training tell always, and they cannot fail to do so in this instance.  I fear for the British armies in France, if they resist the pressure during the coming three months they will have done wonders, because the Russians hopelessly defeated,  The generals to German Bill will have two million trained men well officerd to move to the Western front to assist those of his forces in that region.
