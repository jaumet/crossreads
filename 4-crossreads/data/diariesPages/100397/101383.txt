Troop Ship Berrima 18th.12.15
My Dear Mother
I kept a look out for you and Bett when we were marching from the Rly to Wooloomooloo but could not see you so I suppose you were unable to get in. it was just 6 am when we reached the Loo. the friends and Relatives joined in all along the line and I can tell you that we looked a particularly mixed lot: the civilians were all stopped just before we got to the wharf we were all lined up in the big shed at the wharf and the roll was called, then we went aboard the Boat Then dress off and anchored in the channel until 3.30 P.M. then we set out, for a while we were running into the teeth of a good strong southerly and some of the men, gave in very quickly, to make matters pleasanter there was a light misty rain falling, and all the sheltered parts of the boat were crowded, when dinner time came we had a job to get anything, as the cooks were both tipsy
