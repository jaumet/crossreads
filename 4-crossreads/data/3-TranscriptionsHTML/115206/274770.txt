<p>July 1918<br/>Friday 19</p>
<p>Bresle and Frechencourt.<br/>Weather showery. Reeled in all lines, with Tom Code and after tea left for Waggon Lines. Had journeyed about a kilo when a Staff car pulled up and gave us a flying lift to Pont Noyelles, thus saving a 10 kilo walk, and providing us with an enjoyable ride. Found billet and had a decent feed with Jim Sharp, discussion the latest advance report is 20,000 prisoners and 150 guns</p>
