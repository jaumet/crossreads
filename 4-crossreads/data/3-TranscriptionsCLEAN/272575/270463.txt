  
 30th.9.17. Dear J.   Your letter dated 9/7/17 drifted in from somewhere last night     I am glad that at least a few of the letters I write get through,   The crack I got at Bullecourt was only slight, as I explained in previous Letters, I stayed in bed for about 4 days then, got the hump, because the Quack. who I might mention was not an Australian would do nothing, it was lucky that my blood was in good condition, if you look up old papers, and compare dates you will find that. B. was going Like hell on the 4th & 5th of May, we were right in it, also in Hermes on Easter Monday now I'll have to get busy and tell you what I can in brief.. for we move tonight, at 5. and leave our packs. you can easily guess what that means.   "The guns have been making merry hell for days where we're going, and they're at it now.   You guess right when you say we paid a heavy price at B. we did, and I guess the scrap this time will not be light.. but that remains to be seen
