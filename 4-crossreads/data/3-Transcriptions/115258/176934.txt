<p>I posted a few more photos home yesterday, the post card ones I bought in Alex as I thought were such typical ones of the country round here. I also sent Fred some coins which I will write and tell him about as I think I owe him a letter. Port Said is a wonderful place for<s>e</s>&nbsp;money, you get coins of nearly every nation in the world there for change - you hear every language under the sun there and see all kinds of different civilian dresses and the soldiers there are weird and wonderful - you see everything from the fierce looking Italian Bersigleri with a whole foul yard of feathers in his helmet down to Italian and French colonial troops as black as you hat, who wear puttees but no boots, with great long red fezes with feathers stuck in the side of them - and there are even Armenian refugees there. Port Said is a very slow place most of the time but livens up sometimes at night and great old brawls get going between soldiers</p>
