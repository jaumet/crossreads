We are going to try some practical work today with the guns and on Tuesday we will have some proper target practice. Our ranging turned out fairly well but the signallers couldn’t get our messages through. The 14th Brigade had some target practice today but the shooting was abominable I hope we can do better at any rate. We will probably be leaving this Camp next Friday another stage towards France. We will get there eventually.

Just got official news through that General Townsend with 2000 Tommies and 6000 Indians have been captured by the Turks in Messopotamia – another instance of British cocksureness and optimism. Never enough men. It was the same in S.A. and on Gallipoli. Write to Mollie Messenger. The 49rth Batty starts their shooting tomorrow and ours on Tuesday.

We have been watching the shooting practice by the 49th Batty all the morning and it was jolly good shooting too. We were also watching some bomb throwing by the Infantry. The 50th Battery is shooting this afternoon. We must try and beat them as we are the only two Batteries doing indirect laying. The 49th and 52nd are doing direct laying. Major-General Christian is in charge of our Division and is taking notes in connection with the shooting

We have finished our firing and as far as I can judge we have come out best. I haven’t heard anything more about us moving this week although a few days ago our O.C. Mr. Prior told me himself that the latest orders were we were to move on Friday. Am writing home today and also several other letters if I have time. I don’t think I will have much chance of advancement where I am unless several of the officers get knocked while on active service and I don’t.
