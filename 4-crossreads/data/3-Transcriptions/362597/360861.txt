<p>Monday 10.1.16 (19)<br/>Usual routine till 7 pm when Capt Teague gave a lecture in F Ward on how to keep out of mischief in Egypt.</p>
<p>The weather all the time is very cool &amp; the sea is calm. Every morning about 2 am the wind rises a bit &amp; we have a shower of rain but otherwise it is just like a trip to Manly on a breezy Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>I washed some clothes &amp; hung them over the steam pipe at the back of my bunk &amp; they dries by night time.</p>
<p>Tuesday 11.1.16 (20)<br/>A very eventful day.</p>
