 12th July:- Wednesday To-day is very smooth, even smoother than the first day. The old "Tunisian" is very slow. Very hot. The food is bad, or I should eat a lot. Have prickly heat    & the rash is awfully irritating & a little sore. To-day about 9 am we passed a large boat, evidently a P & O, en route to Egypt & another in the afternoon, too far off to place. Both on starboard side  A concert was held on deck at 5.30 pm, Tommies, Australians & New Zealanders participating. Men in the riggings & everywhere make the scene rather impressive. We expect to pass Malta to-morrow    Reveille 6 am.  6.30 am parade cancelled & only one parade for the day - 10 am. No submarines sighted so far. Our little cruiser escort is always very active
