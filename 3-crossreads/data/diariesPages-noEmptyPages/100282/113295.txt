little boozer that stood on the frontier of Belgium France one side of the road belonging to each country, we had a really enjoyable evening, plenty of coffee biscuits, we all took it in turns to tell yarns, 9 out of 10 of them were connected with Australia. We tried to bring one of our chaps home with us he was dead drunk sound asleep we could not wake him so Howard I carried him outside, the cold night air had a magic effect on him, he suddenly woke up started to lash round with his hands feet the leather was flying properly I managed to stop one on the fleshy part of the leg, that's what we got for trying to do a good turn, however, we got hold of him shook him gave him his hat a little fatherly advice left the young waster, these are the sort of swine that give troops a bad name I reckon we ought to have dragged him home given him a good ducking but it was too much trouble so
