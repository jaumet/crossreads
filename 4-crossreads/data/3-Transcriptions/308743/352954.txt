<p>Revielle at 5.30 am<br/>No signalling but men go straight on to stables then after breakfast we had a general clean up lines horses etc Church Parade follows but only one man steps out to go, so again the troop falls into disgrace. Dinner follows &amp; with sweets to follow kindly cooked by HQ chef then in afternoon settle down to letter writing. A squadron of the 4th Reg pay us a visit from Mena. The Reg [indecipherable] of the 1st Reg died today of pnemonia &amp; several more are down with it. An inquiry is to be held into the health of the men. We hear that an inspection is to be held by the Brigadier on Tuesday as a Bde on the Move. He also strolled through the lines this afternoon &amp; had a look at the cleanliness of the lines.
