[25th Aug. contd]Our section were fortunate & were handy to everything.  After tea I ventured to find a river for a bath but when I found it, it was too dark & cold so I postponed same.  On journey I met Ossy Wood strolling along with some other officers of 9th mg Coy & chatted after things for some time.Slept cold, very draughty.
Sunday 26thAfter parade we were free for the day & took advantage by making a tour of country.  Dick Gates, Davidson, Lyall Walker & self set out per boot "slicked up" etc and passing thro village of Drionville where the 9th mgrs were, we arrived after a pleasant walk at Nesles on the main railway route.  Being Sunday the people were dressed smartly & church was just emptying as we arrived at the village.
This district was occupied by the 19th (Butterfly) English Divn.  Learning that it was impossible to get a train to Desvres we decided to have dinner at Nesles & walk down the valley after.  We had an excellent dinner of fried eggs & chips and the people were very sociable in fact one boy was learning English at St Omer College & could speak well.  Pushing we had rather a stiff climb to top of ridge but was amply rewarded by the view it affords as one can see for miles.
