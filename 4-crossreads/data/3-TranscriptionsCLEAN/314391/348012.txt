a determined rush against an advanced outpost on our right flank. This post is 1400 yds in front of our main lines and since 265 was evacuated by camels has been quiet in the air and has been considered more as an observation post than part of the outpost system and it could never be safely held by us while 265 was in hands of enemy. There is dead ground within30 yds of its front and in this the enemy evidently were massing to rush the post when the attack on 265 spoilt their plan. Our post was however driven back after a bomb fight and were taken in flanks by MGs. They occupied the support position for rest of night. Enemy shelled our trenches a great deal during the night and about 0345 made what now appears a determined effort to rush Nos. 2   & 3 posts. This was repulsed and enemy dug in about 200 yds from our line. When daylight came he found this a very bad position and 7th Regt quickly surrounded him   & caused the surrender of 2 officers 146 O/Rs. 4 Automatic Rifles (Bergmann) enemy rifles   & bombs were also taken. There prisoners state that there are about 4000 Turks at Mulebbis. Our guns at daylight commenced shelling lost observation post and
