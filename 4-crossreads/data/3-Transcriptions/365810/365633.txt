<p>the new Governor of N.S.W., Davidson.  I was not greatly impressed.  He is a very elderly old gentleman who does not strike me as being the man to handle difficult situations during these troublous times at home, but then of course I saw him in rather an embarrassing position.  He and Wade were the only two civilians in a meeting of about 25 senior officers of whom two were generals and the remainder all of field rank.  By the time you get this you will probably have met him yourself.</p>
<p>We had 3 days hard frost this week.  They came on rather suddenly and were all the more miserable on that account.  During a frost in this delightful country everything freezes hard from your moustache to the sauce on the table and the roads become as hard and smooth as glass.  The water difficulty is fairly serious, the pipes will not run water into the tanks and I remember one day last year sending out a limber and a couple of men with an axe of get "water" for the cooks.  Yesterday it thawed and today it is quite warm.</p>
<p>We have got an officers' club in the town about 5 minutes walk away from camp.  There are also a good picture-</p>
