get away?" etc., etc. I was forced to give the same sort of answer so often, that I often many times wished I had a small record in book form to hand them. Hence this book.
Anyway, the sailiaent points of the history of Australian Submarine A.E.2, and my three and a half years prison life in Turkey, are contained in these pages, and my hope is that this brief record may be as interesting to the readers as it is unforgettable by me.
Yours truly.
