<p>From Arthur Fry "Denegully" Northcote Road, Lindfield, N.S.W. to Corporal Alan F. Fry, No.1340, A.I.F. 13th Battalion France</p>
<p>6th Aug. 1916</p>
<p>Dear Alan,<br/>It is several weeks, or probably 2 mos, since I wrote to you last. There has not been opportunity in the office, where things have been jogging rather unevenly, owing to short staff &amp; illness &amp; at home you know it has been short days &amp; cold, &amp; moreover Billy has been an all-pervading obstacle. His tongue never stops.</p>
<p>But after all, under normal circs, I would have written, but the fact is I have been on the sick list in a way &amp; quite unable to make an effort. I acquired a dose of influenza &amp; among Dr. Biffin's prescription was a direction to use a nasal douche. I didn't know anything about the bally thing &amp; instead of going cannily &amp; gently to work, I syringed the water up with a force only equalled, by stupidity,</p>
