We got a lot of papers on board at Albany & on reading through them I was struck by the number of unemployed there are in Australia & the trouble they are having with them
If they can't handle the few there are there now, goodness only knows what will happen when the mob come back, according to the W.A. papers conditions are very bad there & work scarce, but things will right themselves in time, it should not affect me much as I am going on the land.
19th. Sunday & heaven be praised the last we shall spend on the boat   at the conclusion of the service this morning Mr Sims our YMCA Rep. spoke a few parting words  he has proved himself a regular godsend to us & is about the most popular man on the boat
