 in musketri for the purpos of give a hearti recept to the occup of an enemi submarin , should one happen to pop up alongsid the steamer at ani time . Each cabin is fit abov the door with a " Make Break " electr light connect , and immedi the door is open , out goe the light . This is a splendid idea , and veri satisfactori . Order are issu that empti bottl and other refus must not be thrown overboard , as same may be of benefit to the enemi in locat the cours taken by a transport . Dure this portion of the voyag , the speed of the ship is increas to it utmost limit , and all advantag are taken to make port at the earliest opportun , and without undu delay . Fatigu parti of the men are organis for work down the stokehold , wheel coal to a place near the furnac of easi access for the stoker . When within a day or two of port , the troop are given instruct that on enter harbour , and when pass warship or other transport , they must muster on their troop deck and stand to attent . No signal of ani descript are to be made . On the day of arriv in port , all is excit and bustl . The welcom sight of land creat a long unknown to ani but those who have been at sea for a few week . The men are look forward to shore leav at all foreign port , and for that leav to be stop as has been the case in some instanc the writer know of , is beyond comprehens . In one instanc in particular when leav had been cancel owe to a most unfortun circumst , a ladi friend ( who has prove a friend inde to everi Australian Soldier who has had the opportun of call at that port ) help the boy in everi possibl way , to bear their hardship and disappoint . She sent larg consign of fruit to the ship , post letter for the men , made purchas of differ articl for them , was the first to welcom us , and the last to bid us farewel . I need not mention her name here , it is so well known to all the boy , and will ever be rememb . Howev , I must now go on with my stori . We are off the port , and abov us the signal and number are fli at the foremast . At the headland in the distanc , their signal announc our approach , and present we see the pilot boat come out to us . Our ship is stop , and we wait his come . His littl steamer manouvr for a posit alongsid us , and in a short space of time the pilot swing aboard our ship and make for the bridg . Our propel churn the wave again , and we proceed to the entranc and up the harbour . Eager we look for other transport and other interest sight . There is a look of dismay on all face as the yellow flag is run up the yard arm , and instead of tie up at the wharf , we anchor out in the stream . Our trip thus far is at an end , and we watch and wait , and wish for our releas from the ship and for relax ashor . We look at the busi wharf where ship of all nation are load and discharg their cargo . Rumor of all kind among the men are as plenti as the flower in spring , and the wireless receiv and transmit among the troop themselv on a troopship , would baffl old Marconi himself . But I leav you now as we are safe in port with all danger for the time be pass , and the Life on an Australian Transport go on as it has done sinc the first conting left Australia for servic oversea , in 1914 .
