<p>Dear old Dad.</p>
<p>Mum is giving Ruth sums.  The fire is going.  Mum is writing to you.  I am glad we did not have Dictation because I do not like it. and this after noon mum went to meat us because she had to go down to the black smith.  Mum has ritten 1 page full and I have only written a little bit.  I do not like going to school atall now but it is still nice and worm.  To day at school I dug up the gardens. and we coock the tea on the big fire to night.</p>
<p>It is not very cold.  When I told you that I dug up the gardens I did not mean only my self it was all the chrilden and Miss Atkison. and I will hafto soon finish this letter. and Ruth can not write because she hasto do her sums and she has just come over from Mrs gonzes.  The fire is out. and we are not going to have the brisks.</p>
