Friday, 27 January 1917 [1918]An eventful day as regards this quiet life.  Asked Matron at 9.30 a.m. for leave & rec'd it.  Confirmed at 11 a.m. when Matron & Col. Young - it being inspection morning - came round & I was called up to be told leave was granted, then a hurried trip to town with Marge from whom I rec'd my first bunch of Cairo violets.  Bought blouse Pt. 45, no riding skirt obtainable.4 p.m. tea at Groppi's & then evening duty & warnings from C. Grant not to build too much on my holiday & I shall be disappointed but I am not expecting too much.  Visit from Cobbie 8 p.m.  Why has she changed so from the days of G.H. & dear Kath?
