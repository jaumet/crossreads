<p>These pages have no number because they give you the last and possibly the most intimate thoughts of a man who, though he may not have taken as many risks as the front line Light Horseman, has been with them and has observed them and has been perfectly willing to go with them anywhere any time;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it may be that these haphazard notes or writings will some day be interesting to our boys.  There remains much to be said and in my anxiety to record not only the deeds but the atmosphere &amp; character of the L.H., that which it did &amp; thought and looked like.</p>
