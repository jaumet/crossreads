<p>27.5.19<br/>Dear Mum<br/>I hopped on a motor on Saturday   &amp;  went to Sarum. I said Good bye to m dear Friends. I came Home Sunday afternoon. I had no pass or warrant or anything. The police take no notice unless there is a disturbance. It was a lovely day. I took the Misses Freemantle on the river &ndash; it was a lovely day. To say Good-bye to my adopted Home-town. England is enjoying abnormal weather. They have had 22 days without a cloud in the sky, the sweet scents from the woods, from the trees &amp; wild flowers is just wonderful. I expect to sail about 7th June via the Cape of Good Hope.<br/>Fond Love  Harry</p>
