<p>Wednesday 4.4.17<br/>Practically all the casualties through from the stunt.  Fritz shelled heavily during the day all around our post; gave artillery around rough time.  Expect to be relieved to-morrow by 1st Division.  Rations very scanty.</p>
<p>Thursday 5.4.17<br/>Relieved at 10 Am &amp; marched back to Bapaume where we had dinner &amp; moved off again to Bernafay Wood across country another 7 miles; about done when we arrived there but soon pulled together when we had a drop of tea &amp; a spell.  Country which a few weeks ago was alive with traffic is now deserted.</p>
<p>Friday 6.4.17<br/>Good Friday; left Bernafay Wood</p>
