<p>There has been a good deal of dust blowing around to day.</p>
<p>I have a longer journey to the Post Office now as it has shifted into the town along with Brigade Staff they are living in a beautiful summer residence probably subsidised by the Government for the use of the Brigadier and his staff.</p>
