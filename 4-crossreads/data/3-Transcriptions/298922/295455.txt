<p>Wednesday 9 May 1917</p>
<p><strike>SHELLAL again</strike></p>
<p>Our Y.M.C.A. have followed us up consequently Tinned Fruits &amp; "Sausages" can be bought, also good old ENO's fruit Salts. Jim Ayre is still fit &amp; going strong. Usual bombardment going on. Made overtures to the Tommies &amp; used a Kerosene Tin bath along with many of the great unwashed. I was rather ashamed of my own dirty singlet. <strike>My [indecipherable] Major Rank dates from 14/2/17.</strike></p>
<p>Hear Cuth Fetherston Hough is alright &ndash; but ere this you will have seen the Casualty list. I will always cable if I get a crack, so don't worry we can't all be blown out.</p>
<p><strike>The little wife is well.</strike></p>
