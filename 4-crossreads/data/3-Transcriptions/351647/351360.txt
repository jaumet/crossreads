<p>(such nice handy paper do look at the lines)</p>
<p>a great kid.  Fascinating I think &amp; I loved his remark to you [indecipherable] red stockings after <strike>his</strike> your long homily.  So cute, he knows a lot for his age.  I thought of that chaste song we used to have on the first phonograph, you remember in "You're the one" what the nurse said when she brushed his curls.</p>
<p>I think its dead mean of the Murrumbidgee to go &amp; rise so well when I'm away.  To think of Gum Creek running &amp; me not there &amp; I'm sure when I'm back she won't ever run again, not till I take my quadrennial (peu tetre) trip to Paris.  The point races &amp; dance sounded funny, I hope you enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Glad you liked the Kirchner pictures, I'm looking forward to seeing them again.</p>
<p>I shrieked at Carl V. coming up, you howdacious woman.  My word it is time I came.</p>
<p>I suppose I'll pay for that remark later.  Well so be it, I'll put up with a lot if I get back.</p>
<p>We are putting in a much better time now, its great to be out &amp; in nice restful country, clear running streams &amp; green grass &amp; untortured trees, no mud &amp; horrible rotten country &amp; its nice to know (even if it is selfish) that our crowd are for the present comparitively safe,</p>
