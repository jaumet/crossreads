<p>11-3-16<br/>Sat 11th<br/>Had no calls on the phone after 11 oclock last night &amp; slept like a top;  This afternoon I washed out my flannel &amp; intended having a swim but as we were told at dinner time that swimming in the Canal was prohibited, I contented myself with standing in the edge of the water &amp; having a bath in full view of the general public going along the road on the opposite side of the Canal, but as the general public consists exclusively of natives &amp; it appears to be the custom with them to strip off anywhere they want a wash, it didn't much matter.</p>
<p>A good many lads have bought short fishing rods from the natives &amp; have good sport fishing, the fish they catch are only a few inches long but makes good sport &amp; I suppose they would be alright to eat, if they caught enough</p>
