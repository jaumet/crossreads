<p>Sunday Nov 1 &ndash; 1914<br/>Nothing doing as regards war ships  -  Warren of the Parramatta dined on board last eveng  -  &amp; when the usual Rabelaic discourse ended the war &amp; its prospects were discussed  -  The naval men discussed the resignation of Prince Louis of Battenberg as 1st Lord of the Admiralty  -  They hope Fisher will go back  -  He is regarded as the Naval Kitchener &ndash; a great organiser &ndash; not a strategist or tactician  -  He couldn't handle a ship, let alone a fleet, but as an organiser he is supreme &amp; the maker of the modern Navy  -  Fisher says "Favoritism is the secret of efficiency" &amp; in his hands this meant that he picked men &amp; made them his favorites so long as they were efficient but efficiency first &amp; efficiency last in any single department of the navy was Sir John Fisher's aim &ndash; Ships &ndash; Men &ndash; Dockyards &ndash; Coaling Stations all came under his eye &amp; were made stable &amp; efficient  -  Jellicoe under him came to the front &amp; under no other system could Jellicoe have become Admiral of the Fleet  -  The road to eminence should <u>not</u> be thro the rooms of Buckingham Palace or the Royal Yacht but thro hard work done by a strong brain -</p>
