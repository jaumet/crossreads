<p>We relieved the 53rd Bn. about 9 p.m. this evening.</p>
<p>10th<br/>All had a fairly good rest after the relief was complete last night.</p>
<p>Our Hqrs. are in a fine old Chateau in the village of Villers Bretonneux.  Practically nothing had been taken from the place by the civilians when they left.  Food, drink and clothing are everywhere or rather was as the men have been constantly scouting around for what they can find.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the village is being gradually shelled to pieces.</p>
