<p>What we suffered during that day with our blistered heels, the terrible weight we carried, the awful mud we went through, can be imagined, perhaps.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was during this&nbsp;day that I first heard the guns, Only a &quot;boom, boom, boom,&quot;&nbsp;in the distance, but it gave a funny sensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was also during this day that I felt a decided itching on my legs and arms, could not account for it, but put it down to the marching making me so hot.</p>
