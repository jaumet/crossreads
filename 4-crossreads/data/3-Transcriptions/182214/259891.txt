<p>bombardment going on. Oct 31<sup>st</sup>.It rained during the afternoon but I saw several battles in the air saw two [?] down but didn&#39;t know whose they were so put them down to Fritzy, Jim Kelly got badly hit in the head, Nov2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp; a fine day for a change counted 73 aeroplanes in the air &amp; saw some good fights. one brought down in flames a few more had another fight. The Horse Ambulances were not much use so they invented sledges to put the wounded on &amp; drawn along by a horse a very good idea &amp; the [?] got a better ride. Fritzy sends us a few [?] at night along the top road.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
