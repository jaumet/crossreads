<p>Wed 30th Jan 18<br/>Allotted to NH Platoon 14 Section &amp; had to march about 4 miles on to where they are camped at St Eloi or rather where St Eloy has been as it is hard to find a compliete brick let alone a piece of wall standing Thompson &amp; Bill  in this platoon. We have been together right through &amp;they are both good mates An <strike>other</strike> old hand &ndash; Proso &ndash; is with us have spent the afternoon making a "dugout" with buiscuit tins full of dirt &amp; bow iron pinched from a R E dump close by. It will be quite the "Home" when finished room for 2 bunks on each side &amp; about 2 ft of space down the centre &amp; just high enough to stand upright The country is all shell holes full of water old trenches wire &amp; all kinds of rubbish. About 100 yds away on the crest of a ridge are some imense mine craters fully 30 to 40 ft deep. There are a great many guns about that do a lot of fireing but so far no shell have come near us They say we are 3,000 yds from the front line</p>
