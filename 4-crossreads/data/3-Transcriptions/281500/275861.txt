<p>torn up &amp; sleepers smashed, but wonderful to say no one was hurt.</p>
<p>I was talking to an old Tommy this morning, &amp; my feet were as cold as ice.  I was telling him what a job I have to keep them warm, &amp; he advised me to rub them with rum so I decided to try it &amp; I was astonished at the result the feet kept as warm as toast all night &amp; so far today they are warm, so now I intend to use the rum issue on my feet instead of giving it away, just imagine what some of the boys will say when they see the good rum going to waste like that.  Wonders will never cease! this evening I had no less than 110 green envelopes to divide among 20 men, they re fairly chucking them at us now &amp; one time you could not get one for love nor money.  I have myself paid 2/6 for a "greenie", &amp; now</p>
