  
 [Continuation of Compton Mackenzie's despatch of 30 June 1915] the victory upon the left would be fruitless, that the position would become an untenable salient and the Haricot redoubt revert to the enemy. At this moment a message was sent to say that the trenches must be recaptured, and when recaptured held.  There were still five hours of daylight for this battle of the longest day.  British guns and howitzers were asked for and were lent at once.  The bombardment was resumed throughout that afternoon, and at half past five it seemed as if every gun on earth was pouring shells on the Turkish lines.

The Turkish casualties were at least 7,000.  One trench two hundred yards long and ten feet deep was brimming over with the dead.  They were valiant, those dead men.  French Officers who have fought in the west say that
