<p>Dear Dad,</p>
<p>I will answer all your questions in letters 11/2/18 &amp; 17/2/18 &amp; 3/2/18.  Ellis &amp; Dick, my other mate, have gone to the Theatre.  I have been cleaning up my Room generally &amp; now I'll sit down to write until the other two come Home.  I had two Teeth filled to-day.  I go up to the Dentist regularly.  It saves a lot of pain &amp; saves the teeth</p>
