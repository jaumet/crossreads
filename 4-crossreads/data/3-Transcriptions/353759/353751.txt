<p>1  April 27  1916<br/>On Tuesday just before mess the rumours that in future the Australians here were only to get 15F. a fortnight came out.</p>
<p>Mess was a hell of a rowdy meal and more talking-down went on than eating &ndash; anyhow the meat was rotten. Those drawing 1/- a day don't feel the pinch, but those drawing 2/- almost to a man decided while it was only a rumour not to take anything at pay if it was true. Some of the arguments as to wether the authorities would be able to so reduce our pay, without a pays warning were not half bad, but as was most natural side issues were more argued on than the main idea. Even at 9am yesterday, just before pay the betting against the reduction was 2-1, but just before pay, the Col gave it out officially &ndash; and we took it like lambs: we really couldn't take it any other way for the simple reason that his way of announcing it was as rotten: perhaps the Government is &ndash; as he says &ndash; hard up, but even so at least a pay's notice should have been given. The generally accepted explanation is that the government feel that the money is more needed <u>in</u> Australia than <u>by</u> Australians abroad &ndash; which is damned unfair to us. Another explanation is that being the highest paid unit here jealousy by the French, but more by the Tommies is going to be stopped by reducing our pay to equal, or be more in proportion to them. Damn the Pommies anyhow, - it was their doing that our pay was reduced early in the campaign &ndash; from 5/- to 2/- a day while in Egypt.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was out in Marseille with Roach, Joe Rodgers and Alan Lewis &ndash; previously we'd arranged to go to the 5F pictures in the evening, but on starting out we'd cut this out on account of the 15.F cost. However the unexpected appearance of Parson Watson, alone, in shorts</p>
