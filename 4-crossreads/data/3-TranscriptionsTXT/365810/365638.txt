 Land of the towering stalwart gum Land of the evergreen What shall our message be to you, Who sent us out to "see it through" And take our stir at the War God's brew, Where never the guns are dumb? 
 Land in the grip of a winter stern Land of the leafless tree From you who bear the war's deep scar, A message speed to our homes afar, "Well we know that the door's ajar "Love, and to you a quick return."
