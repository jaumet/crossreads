 complained about the treatment we were getting, as our tents had been pulled down for fumigating & we could not very well go into the other tents, as we were reported to have diphtheria.  the S.M. went to Maj. Granville about it & Granny went to the Col. the Col. went to the Drs & was told that we did not have diphtheria, but was only suffering from sore throats;  I have had my throat painted with iodine three times to-day & three times yesterday. Bought some stamps & posted a few letters after tea & retired to bed early
