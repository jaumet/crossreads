<p>a dozen or so he went off. I lay awake for some time in my dug out, a snug little place, not because it wasn't bombproof (no more than a London house, for it is only tarpaulin over a shallow hole in the ground) but because a telephonist was installed in it and from time to time he had to light a candle to take down messages that were coming through. After a while I went off to sleep and had a fair night's rest. This morning I had breakfast in bed and then went out with my canvas to the position I had decided to work from. By bad luck the day was cloudy but as I only drew, that didn't so much matter. The place where I worked was an abandoned dug-out, once occupied by some Tommies who had been shelled out and it gave me a fine view of the scene I've already told you of.

They're always singing and cursing merrily - the lightest hearted jokers in the world.</p>
