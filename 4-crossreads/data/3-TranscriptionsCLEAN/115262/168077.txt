  
 Tuesday 6 November 1917. 
 [The first sentence struck through:] At 6 a.m. I.C.C. Battns got a little into touch with each other.  
 Bombardment by both sides is terrific. Shelling too hot so we moved our position behind some rocks. Not too soon as shells burst wlhere we had been a few minutes before. 
 Stayed there till 2 pm. when we were relieved by a group from B Section. Instead of traversing the road swept by shell fire to reach our riding camels 2 miles away we made off across the hills. Went 11/2 miles & had to return to 2 nd  Battn as the shell fire was too hot even tlhere. Traversed shell swept road & reached camels at dusk. 
 Returned to Clearing Station at 6 pm. Prepared a little to eat & turned in dog tired after the first day of under dinkum shell fire.
