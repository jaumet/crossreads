  
 Sunday 3 September 1916 Exciting chase of Taube by our plane in morning. West and I rode down to Mohomeda [possibly Mahemdia] to hold horses for chaps going on leave.  Had swim - naturally! Church parade in evening. 
 Monday 4 September 1916 Small squad of us out on patrol the other side of Quatia [possibly Katia] looking for buried treasure but did not find any. Had a big feed of ripe dates also some nice figs.
