<p>December 1917<br/>Monday 31<br/>Cold day. Got orders to move 3pm. At 3.30 we were off carrying all our swag. Awful load. Had long walk back to B.H.Q. about 2 and a half miles. Fairly good road. Saw Dave on the way.<br/>Arrived at dusk. Pitched bivouac and camped for night which kept fine but cold.<br/>No chance of writing.<br/>Finish fighting on this front. We are going right back for the winter.</p>
