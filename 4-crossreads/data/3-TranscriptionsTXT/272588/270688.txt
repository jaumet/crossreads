Tuesday 9 AprilWet to-day.  This afternoon to Bertangles, north of Amiens about nine kilometres.We are camped under canvas on a decent hill overlooking the biggest airdrome I have yet seen.  Heavy bombardment on the front from early morning & is going now & extended back as far as west of Amiens.
Wednesday 10 AprilYe Gods, Fritz has attacked in the north about Fleurbaix, etc. & captured Saily [Sailly] sur la Lys, Laventie & Estaires.  The bombardment, very heavy continued until early this morning on this front & was very intense. Wet off & on to-day & a walk to Villers Bocace. Fritz is marvellous!!!  The above is so far only a rumour confirmed by Corps H.Q., & I cannot say on what front he has attacked. Our camp here is very decent, but there is no water. Whilst we were in bed to-night we were warned with tragic suddenness to be ready to move in the morning to entrain for the north.
