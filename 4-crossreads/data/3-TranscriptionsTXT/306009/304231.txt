 1915 Feb. 14 Sun. Number of patients now up to 780. The attack on the Suez Canal was made by about 30,000 Turkish Troops who lost about 1000 dead &amp; wounded &amp; then retired back over the Sinai Desert.  2 Battalions of the Australian Imperial Force were in the trenches although I believe they never  had occasion to fire a shot &ndash; I doubt whether the Turks will make a second attack on Egypt.
