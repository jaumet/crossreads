There seems to be a new town of unlovely red brick dwellings and shops. Rode out at 4 pm and returning homewards passed some ambulance cars full of nurses. There is an aerodrome near Talmas and the planes were all drawn up ready for a night flight. Shells are stacked all along the roadsides and there are sentries on them. There are an enormous number of men on back jobs in the Army. Saw a crowd of Chinese coolies on the march just like children and all dressed anyhow. One had an umbrella. Saw also plenty of Indian soldiers. God knows we have enough different races fighting on our side. Began to get very sore after riding such a distance and developed a great thirst. In every French village they dam up a certain amount of the drainage into an evil smelling pond in the centre of the place and use it for watering the horses. Covered with green bubbling scum these ponds are not an ornament. In the wood near Molliens au Bois are large shell dumps. The lives of the dwellers in these lovely woods is Arcadian. Many French women and children toiling late in the fields. Reached Montigny about 7 and after dinner yarned with Gorman about many things. Gothas hummed overhead in the stillness of the evening.
