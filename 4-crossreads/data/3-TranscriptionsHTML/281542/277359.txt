<p>Sunday 29th Aug. 1915</p>
<p>A perfect day &ndash; quietness reigns supreme.</p>
<p>3 p.m. spoke to Richards re Report mentioned in Brigade orders for Aus. &amp; N.Z. H.Q. Div.  Referred to Major Wisdon in recommendation of the C.O.  Produced copies of references.</p>
<p>Monday 30th Aug. 1915</p>
<p>Reported again to Major Wisdon 5th Bde Hqs at 9 am.  Sent to Aus. &amp; N.Z. Hqs. immediately &amp; taken on Div staff as Clerk to Col. Braithwaite.  Transferred to be applied for.  Took over full equipment from 20th.  These Hqs are situated on the beach halfway between Anzac &amp; Wildrons Hill.  We were shelled this afternoon consistently by a big gun from the direction of &ndash; doing great damage to mules &amp; stores.  A few men injured.</p>
<p>Monday 31 Aug. 1915</p>
<p>I am not yet satisfied whether I have done the right thing in leaving the 20th.  Perhaps promotion will be the ultimate result.  I expect it to be so.  I am relieving a Sergeant who has been wounded.  All the Clerks here carry a rank.  All are New Zealanders however who receive less pay than the Australians.  I am to get my Australian pay.</p>
<p>Wednesday 1st Sept. 1915</p>
<p>Nothing unusual.  Obsessed with new duties.</p>
<p>Thursday 2nd Sept. 1915</p>
<p>Posted Mab a letter.  Handed in to Censor 6.30 pm.</p>
<p>Friday 3rd Sept. 1915</p>
<p>No further letters yet.  Sent Mab a Service Card.  Have just heard that the troopship "Southland" has been torpedoed on her way here with some of the 6th A.I.B. on board.  The 100 was drowned.  The men took to the boats and the majority were saved.</p>
<p>Aeroplane reconnaissance by the Turks has been very active during the day.  An unconfirmed report states that the Turks intend to make a general attack on all points in W before the 5th.</p>
<p>The general situation is too quiet for special comment.  Operations are purely local &amp; the incidents of the day are confined to the region, evening fire from torpedo destroyers shore batteries &amp; nightly demonstrations with spasmodic replies from the Turks with shrapnel &amp; machine guns.</p>
