<p>We are all very much taken with the jeune filles.  They certainly are a pretty lot, and have a wonderful complexion.  Think I'll come back here to live when the war is over.  You might let all my girls know, will you?  My French is coming on fine and most of us can manage to make ourselves understood pretty well, though the coinage is pretty strange as yet.</p>
<p>Will write again first chance, as we are not allowed to say too much as yet.  Have not had a mail for some time now.</p>
<p>Love to all and hope all are O.K.</p>
<p>From your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>
