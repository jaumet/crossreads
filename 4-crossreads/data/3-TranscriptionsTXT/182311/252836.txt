 early stage of the war, some twice wounded, all are eager to learn the phase of war that we teach, they are very keen and it is a genuine pleasure to work with them. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; France is now becoming much more bearable with the approach of spring, a slight warmth is now felt in the sun-shine, the frosts are past, birds are noisy and the mud which was everywhere is now stiffening into solid earth; the skies were misty but now that they are clear and the observation better, aeroplanes are very busy both day and night. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; No, I&#39;ve no startling adventures to relate this time, for lately I&#39;ve only been killing Germans with my mouth, but it is one way of doing the work and winning the war, for these boys are as keen as mustard now to see if they can do better than the Australians.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; Very sincerely yours, 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold.
