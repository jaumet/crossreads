Tuesday 15 [14] May 1917 [1918]Quiet day.  Sat out on roof most of afternoon & the sight of the sea is good indeed.Down in our harbour here is lying a boat, within their cabins drowned while asleep, an M.O. & some men, hatches were opened by spies & the boat sank.A balloon up evidently on guard looks so pretty a picture in the clear blue sky & the soft sea air & fleecy clouds are so different to our dry & dusy [dusty] old Cairo.7.50 p.m.Surprise for me re H.F. is still worrying as do not know how or what to reply.
