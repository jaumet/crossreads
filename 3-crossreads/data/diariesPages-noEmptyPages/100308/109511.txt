6/5/17  Norreuil
all our poor tired chaps again. Used this opportunity to group them and their dugouts into their platoons (the battalion is now only equal to 1 coy. in strength). Also organized these four platoons into their 4 component parts gunners, bombers, rifle bombers and riflemen. Can raise about 200 bayonets. The attack was beaten off as one chap said "We bombed C-- out of them!" Stood down at breakfast time. During the morning the shelling was normal. Winter Redheap 23rd were killed and Rossiter wounded. The General came along and said that the first Bde and the 2nd Gordons will take Bullecourt tonight and the remnants of the 6th Bde will be formed into a composite battalion about 1000 strong under myself to occupy the railway as supports. Commenced all the necessary preparations ? bombs, SAA, panniers, reserve officers. Quite a number of 12th Battn stragglers hanging round here today and their excuses are pathetically weak. Bumped them all back to the firing line under the guidance of runners. A bad case of shell shock in one of our stretcher bearers ? all atremble shaking
