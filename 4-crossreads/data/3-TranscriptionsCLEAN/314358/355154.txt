 28 April 1917 To 'Our Children' 
 There is only a little party of us. We are supposed to be isolated on account of mumps and measles outbreaks in out hut. 
 But as idleness is not good for the troops the S.W.O has ordered light excercise 
 The O.C. thereupon issues orders to the company S.M. that we are to go for a route march in full marching order. 
 The S.M. orders our hut corporal to see that this is carr5ied into effect. 
 Our hut Corporal fall us in. Numbers us off, forms us into fours, gives us "Quick march" and off we go. 
 Down a steep grassy bank at the rear of the camp we settle onto a flint road below.
