in a dug-out for two nights without a wink of sleep.
Thursday 2.11.16
Large sick parade, only 8 of our section left including myself. Have heavy cold slight trench feet but stuck it out. Went out again to the posts, but work getting harder each day. Quite a common occurrence to get stuck in the mud while carrying a stretcher. Received a few letters prior to leaving camp but owing to heavy work from the time we took over post from 15th F Amb, was unable to read them till late at night. Expect to be relieved by a second division amb to-morrow. Five of 15 F Amb wounded by shrapnel a few minutes after we relieved them.
