  
 May. 12th.  With the "Karagola" just astern of us, we passed out of the Canal at 5.30, covering 87 miles in 11 1/2 hours. However the "Karagola" left two hours or more ahead of us but we caught her at 8 p.m., passing her to strains of "Good Byee!!" Country of Sinai & that of Egypt along Gulf of Suez is the most inhospitable country I have seen.  Now in Red Sea. 14th.  Very hot two days & a few patients stricken down. Southern Cross visible to-night!!!
