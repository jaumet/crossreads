<p>Sunday 21st May<br/>It is quite disappointing when my stand to arms in am without an attack. Our position is now very strong. All our redoubts are very strong, in front of my dispensary is the graveyard where those that died of the glorious R.S.Fus lie buried. They must have made a magnificent fight. Dead Camels and Turks cause a lot of flies and every day I go round spraying with Formaldhyde [formaldehyde] which works wonders.</p>
<p>Monday 22nd May<br/>It is reported that 6 and 7th ALH were going out to a attack Turkish camp to-day, having not yet heard result and many Bedouin prisoners brought in to-day. Some canteen stores arrived to-day, welcome appreciation, we have only had bully beef since we arrived here, each man was allowed to buy 5/- worth. Also mail in. I rec 6 letters, one from my brother in France which relieved my mind a deal.</p>
<p>Tuesday 23rd May<br/>Early in the am a The Lowland unit moved off and they were relieved by no other than a detachment of my old unit The 1st LHF Amb, although I only knew one of them all the rest are [undistinguishable]. The joke is that I have a full dispensary and they have nothing and yet I am supposed to obtain my supplies from them.</p>
<p>Another prisoner was brought in to-day, the 6th and 7th LH were supposed to have had a skirmish yesterday. I request and this morning rec a big box of medical comforts came, and I have partitioned half of the drop off for a hospital and the patients were getting the same treatment us as a base.</p>
