 Commanding Officer's' course at Aldershot for two months. I am very proud of Bas, he has done well. Travers is a Lieut-Colonel commanding a Battalion &amp; has also distinguished himself greatly. 
 I think I told you how young Harris of your Service did as one of my Engineer Officers. I tried to get him some distinction but have not succeeded yet. He is a most competent &amp; gallant officer &amp; deserves well of your Trust. I trust his service will be recognised. 
 I am so glad you saw my brave little daughter &amp; her fine son Billie. I have had numerous photos &amp; am very proud of the grandson. 
 I am sorry to hear about poor old Norrie; give him my sympathy. 
 Kindest t=regards to Messrs Mance, Walsh, Smail &amp; Harry Williams. Best of good wishes to your good wife &amp; family &amp; heaps of good luck to yourself. 
 Your sincere friend 
 WILLIAM HOLMES 
 I forgot to say I am very well..
