There was a bathing parade today to the baths at Daours in an old mill worked by a waterwheel. The water was hot. We got a heavy shower coming back. Since we came to this camp there has been a great plague of horse flies though they have been in evidence all of the summer but not very bad until lately. Up North we were free from all flys. This morning the enemy put up a barrage, the smoke of which we could see on a line from the right of Corbie to beyond Merricourt where it was lost in the distance. The smoke of it was like a forest on fire and it lasted for a couple of hours. We heard this evening that he attempted to come over. I received six francs this evening for the match box covers & C.
