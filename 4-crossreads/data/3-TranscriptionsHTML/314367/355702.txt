<p>'Send the man'!! &ndash; Not much, said I &ndash; I take no orders from the military &ndash; "the junior service" &ndash; It's like their damned cheek &ndash; Quite right &ndash; said Fitz who had come up &ndash; "I'll complain to the Administrator" which he very promptly did &ndash; He's Senior Naval Officer &amp; I'm Senior Naval Surgeon at Rabaul &amp; they've got to treat us &ndash; only one way - &amp; that's the right way &ndash; with respect &ndash; Mind you &ndash; as I told Fitz &ndash; We've had nothing in the way of a request &ndash; written or otherwise &ndash; It will all wash out of course &ndash; in our favor &ndash;</p>
<p>The Military <u>medical administration</u> is the weakest &ndash; feeblest thing, I've ever seen &ndash; The Ward room says I shall get the Iron Cross for obstinacy &amp; strong mindedness &ndash; Anyway I'm careful to do all I can myself &amp; I consult Fitz on naval points &amp; then Mr Bumpus &amp; I feel I have a little power in my own line to run my own show &ndash; successfully &ndash;</p>
