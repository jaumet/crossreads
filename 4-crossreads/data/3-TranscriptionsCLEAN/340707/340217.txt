 After this I returned to Rue Delambre a pied The day was rather too much for me 
 9-8-19 Repose all day headache - fever, glanular swellings - 
 10-8-19 Toss about all day. Brise makes many trips per day & suggest that I rest at her home where I can be looked after. It will save her an hours walk 2 or 3 times per day & she will call in her doctor. If I am no better I have decided to this 
 Tonight we went to Odeon one of the 4 theatres subsided by Govt entirely (Opera, Comedie Francaise & Palais Royal being the other). Drama was L'Arlesienne. The music by Bezet was excellent. Orchestra had 14 violins alone The acting was good but at times a little tedious. It needed a Pauline Frederic to play one part & she was not in cast. 
 After theatre as I am still ill, I take taxi home to her place & put in a miserable night. Brise pleading to [indecipherable] for me
