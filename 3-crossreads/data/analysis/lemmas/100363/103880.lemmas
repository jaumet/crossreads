I am to leav by P and 0 Malta tomorrow . 19th Left by train at 11.25 am for Tilburi and after pass through the usual formal final board the Malta . Toward even we slowli drop down stream and in the morn anchor off Deal . 20th Novr /17 Here we lay all day and at dark crept out to Plymouth . The view shoreward was particular fine , the silhouett of the land be broken up by a number of power searchlight scour the sky for hostil aircraft .
