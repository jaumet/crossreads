It was this way - underestimating the turks capacity for defence or strength, the brigade advanced in close order mounted, to try & rush the position.  The turks never fired at the screen - who by the way advanced nearly on top of the Turkish trenches - but waited until the whole brigade, mounted & in close order, mark you, advanced to within 300 yds. of them, & then let go with three or four machine guns & some hundreds of rifles.  The brigade of course broke & scattered back to cover & reached it without one single man or horse being hit!! Christmas tomorrow on bully beef! Two 'planes over this morning, dropped several bombs but did no damage.  They have built a pier
