The machines circled like great vultures over the doomed Citadel, and I could distinctly see the large 100 lb bombs drop through the air. With a great detonation one fell directly in the courtyard. God knows what heinous carnage it wrought, but the whole place lay obscured by the dust of crunched masonry and smoke. We then fled on our mission of destruction to Kutrani. At the station lay a train under full steam and about 100 rolling stock. Close by we observed a new Hun Aerodrome with five Hangars and a number of machines out on the flying ground. We bombed them lustily, and returned with all speed fearing pursuit by hostile aircraft.
