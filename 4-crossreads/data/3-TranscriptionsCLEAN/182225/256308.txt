 1916   SATURDAY 8   JULY 
 Fine & sunny but very cold in morning & evening. We sighted three torpeado boats in morning early & they came up full speed & each took a boat under its care at once and the "Swiftsure" went back. As soon as we got our torpedo boat each we each went as hard as we could  The "Marathon" went straight to the front and stayed there then the "Benalla" then us & the "Beltana" last. We had a full dress parade in morning and the final of the boxing in afternoon, there were no good spars. Had a concert after the boxing but it was no good. They took collections for a few of the crew who had done little things for us & got a good amount for them. Expect to get to England tomorrow afternoon.
