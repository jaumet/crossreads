  
 Its for the same reason that I fear many will be rather disappointed in Australia when they return, they are so used to imagining it a Paradise entirely, that they have clothed it in all the most radiant hues of their imagination, in the same way  a child  one always thinks the scenes & times of childhood much larger & more grand than they appear in later life - I fear that there will be a good deal of "coming back to earth" when we all return for Australia to us here appears like the "Green Hills far away" all that is absolutely perfect & to be desired - I try not to let myself deceive myself. 
 Have you heard from Ces Verge lately?  I think I've seen most of the people I knew before the war who have come over.  My brother is a M.O. in the 3rd Divn., I saw him last week for the first time since he came over, I don't think you ever met him. 
 Am fit & well & at present D.A.D.M.S., 1st Anzac Corps only temporarily, expect to go back to the Amb. shortly.  My love to John & the kid. 
 With all of the best to yourself J.B. Metcalfe
