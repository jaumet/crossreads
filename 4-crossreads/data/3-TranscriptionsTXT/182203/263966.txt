At Sea23. 5. 15.  My dearest Moth.It is six weeks since I left Melb. and am still on the sea. Oh. how I should love to have a peep at you all now. Sorry I cannot write much but hope to be able to soon.It is fearfully hot and think  y there will be very little of me left if the heat continues. The sea is very calm just now. Last week I had a bad time for two days - (sea-sick again)  Feeling very well now. Dorothy is very well again, she was not ill this time. We had a concert last night  & she sang but not nearly so well as she did last Sunday. We also have a man on board with a magnificent voice  & he sang better than ever last night. He is a Welshman, his name is Jones. I wonder if he is any relation to John Jones? The programme was very good. We pass the time playing Bridge, deck Billiards etc. also   Fortune Telling - Mollie's friend from Geelong is the Fortune-teller. She is kept very busy reading hands & cards. I had a long yarn to her yesterday. She has been well all the time.
