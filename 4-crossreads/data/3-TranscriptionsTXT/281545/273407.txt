The Traffic Officer stopped him & I asked him for a lift which was freely given & into the Car I stepped & off we went, as he was only going as far as the [indecipherable] Chateau, I was pleased to get a ride that far, arriving at the Chateau I thanked the Cyclist for the lift & he then directed me to Brieleu about a mile away where I would meet our Line & then along I walked to Regersberg another mile & arrived at Regersberg at about 9 Pm, I then had a short rest & took up duties at Midnight.
Tuesday 15/1/18.    On finishing at 8 am I saw where one of our Aeroplanes had come to grief in an open piece of ground close to our Camp.   From what one of the Guards on duty alongside of the Aeroplane told me, it appears that the afternoon previous, the pilot had stopped his Engine & was volplaning down & when he tried to start his Engine again it failed & with the result that he had to land best he could, his Machine struck the ground fairly hard & the propeller was broken & the nose of the machine went about 2 ft into the soft mud & there it remained with the Tail sticking up in the air.   The Pilot was not hurt only receiving a bad shaking.  During the day, it was removed to the Aerodrome for repairs.
