 Thursday 7 March On fatigue at A.D.S., working on the dugout. Last night Fritz shelled the line for four hours with "mustard gas" &amp; about one hundred casualties to 9th Battn. was the result.  Colonel, Adjutant, &amp; Capt. Phillips (1st F. Amb.), M.O., were gassed.  Some cases were very bad &amp; came down on the light railway, eyes &amp; other parts of the body were affected.  The cases were pitiful. Glorious day. Go up to the posts on Sunday. 
 Friday 8 March Working on dugout at A.D.S. &amp; it is just about complete. Weather glorious.
