 horror : but one is immun to all these , pass by as unperturb , as though they were just piec of rock . Colonel Shellshear call dure the even , is go to spend the even with us . Outsid it is blow a gale pelt rain . The distant sky shimmer with the reflect of the Artilleri , which is in action day night . My piti is for the poor wretch in the trench , who are freez soak to the skin . 25th Octr ./17 Visitor are a confound nuisanc . Col Shellshear stay the night though perfect welcom , delay an earli start . My result suffer , as the day are now short today was of rare sunshin . I visit various waggon line around Dickebush , also a concentr Camp where I met the 58th . Batallion . The 58th .
