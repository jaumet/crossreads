At 1730 went down to Bde. HQ and saw Bde Major re.  Returned through saps and came out in firing line. Shell from 75 plunged into bank 10 yards away burst and deluged me with clods and fine dust. In firing line new 3.7 mortar just placed fired a couple of bombs but enemy artillery were waiting and put a 75 in.
It burst in the next post wrecking it fortunately they were all in the tunnels at the time. Nothing could be seen for some seconds on account of the dense acrid fumes of the high explosive. A close shave. Splinters lying all around us. Continued working mortar.
Their artillery and machine guns miss no opportunity as their information is good.
Uneventful evening and to bed at 2130.

Rose 04.30 and after stand to arms left with Major Smith and Dr Drummond for a swim at Anzac Cove Went through burial ground and along big sap to beach. Remarkable the amount of stores there. Ketch lying in shallow water about 200 yards N of pier, sunk by Beachy Bill. Jack Tars handy men about beach. Dugout and blanket settlement up cliff. 
Had clothes all off first time for 14 days and had a good wash and swim off barge. Lovely sunny morning view of sea perfect. Two large white hospital ships looked well. The delightful precipitous islands of Imbros and Samothrace throwing blue shadows over calm water. Our green valley like a funnel.
