Wednesday 15 January 1919Nice & warm again.  We can see Trawlers sweeping for mines on the coast & I dreamt last night we were embarking from the Beach here - a la Gallipoli but for home.My job of writing War History of the Regiment means a good deal of extra work - if I had my old Diary I could do it well but it has to be done at once.One has no conveniences cramped in a Tent & other calls on my time.
