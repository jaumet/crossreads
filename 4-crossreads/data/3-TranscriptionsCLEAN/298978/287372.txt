When I reached Margy, he said "tell Harwood to bring the lads back, they are not wanted there and there isn't room for them; I don't want to lose my boys for nothing" - so back I had to go again.This time could not find Haywood, so then I had to find where our boys were on my own and pass the word for the 16th Battalion only to retire.
One rather amusing incident - while trying to get into the trench it didn't seem possible to do so without jumping on somebody's head; one of the chaps exclaimed to me " Come off the sky line, you  ---  fool " - "I will," I replied, "as soon as I can find space" "Jump in anywhere," he answered back, "never mind if you do hit anybody, your'e not in a drawing-room."It certainly did seem ridiculous, standing on ceremony in a time like this, though I don't suppose anything will alter this peculiar side of my nature.They are now digging a connecting trench between our new front and our old trenches - we have had to retire, the Turks are too strong for us.
May  11Dawn.  The roll is called - how heart-breaking it is - name after name is called; the reply a deep silence which can be felt, despite the noise of the incessant crackling of rifles
