<p>3 Monday<br/>A very rough sea.  Ship pitching &amp; rolling very much.  Very changeable weather.  Rained during the day.  Got very sea sick.  Went on sick parade for cold.  Rained very heavy during the night.  Still out of sight of land.  Nearly every body is very sea sick &amp; are lying about all over the upper deck.  There are very few go below for meals.</p>
<p>4 Tuesday<br/>Still a very rough sea &amp; ship rolling very much.  Still very sick, couldn't keep up after 8 pm. admitted to C ward &amp; spent a very bad night.  Still out of sight of land.  I wont be sorry when we get through the Bight as apparently we struck it at a very rough time.  Parades are held daily but few go on them on account of being too sick</p>
<p>5 Wednesday<br/>Sea still a very rough.  Rained slightly during the day. Ship rolling very much.  Still feeling very sick, suffering from gastritis &amp; sea-sickness.  Spent a very restful night. It is very windy &amp; the boat is sometimes nearly submerged, owing to tremendous big rollers.  It is impossible to stand on the upper deck for at times the water sweeps right over it.</p>
