 27 August 1918 Tuesday (X to X crossed out) President of a Court Martial at Division today,  I hate these things but  have to take my turn.  Hear we are going to lose our Camel Reinforcements- again as more men are now available-  Have a touch of my old complaint Bronchitis, aggravated by the dust, but nothing serious. X I wash &amp; clean my teeth, all around my bed to lay the dust &amp; on one side have a funk hole to jump into if necessary X- ones ears get trained to Shells &amp; the lovely language of L.H. troopers.
