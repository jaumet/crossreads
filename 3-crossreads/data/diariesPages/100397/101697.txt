any secret of the fact, some of them are better off in Blighty than they ever were at home, but I wont say any more about them for I guess you'll find it dry reading. Lately the weather has been with us, and I begin to believe that this place is at times "A Sunny France" but the end of the Summer is nearing and we may get bad weather at anytime. I can tell you its not a very cheerful prospect, Last October was enough for me, I was properly in the mud that time and will not forget it for quite a long time.
The news today seems to be good the Hun is fighting hard at parts of his line but in many places Hindenburg's line has been broken and now the High Command is thinking hard, and wondering what will happen next, well let them wait and see.
Have not heard of Nell Crom. for ages She was further south and was right in the fighting zone. I expect that Her Hos. had to pull out, and make for safety. Had word from Overstrand all were well Mrs H. was overjoyed to have all the Boys back Harold some of his mates were all on leave together Last mail brought along a letter from T. Kennett of Blue Nobbys. he has left the place and is now at Wallangra. had not seen the nag for quite a long time but thought that he was allright. Also had a letter from Grace Lord, haven't answered it yet, will do so later on. She said you had told her that I would be glad of news of the Old Place, so she wrote. Thats about all for the present You will see by the way this is finished up that Im in a hurry so will say no more except to Send Love to all at home from your Affec Bro Chas G.P
This paper was captured near here from the H. Qrs of the "Schwer Grupp" which I take it means the "Right Group." or right wing of an artillery division ? I wish the Huns would use a better class of Stationery and would leave more envelopes The swine who owned this left none.
