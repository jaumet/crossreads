<p>15th Am taking over orderly sergeant for a while, &amp; it is a rotten job for you have to be so particular about things &amp; you are tied down so.</p>
<p>Rather cooler weather today we could do with a good fall of rain.</p>
<p>16th yesterday 3 Germans got away from this camp, we have quite a number here working you know.</p>
<p>We also have a lot of "conscientious objectors", &amp; they look a miserable looking crowd, just the sort of people one would couple with "wowsers" &amp; such people</p>
