Naturally enough we looked to our interpreter as our leader, and he in keeping with the old time adage "all's fair in love and war" managed on a certain occasion to get in conversation with a young "fraulein" who was working in a factory close to the railway line. Things went on smoothly for a while and letters used to be smuggled through the fence when the sentries weren't around, but unfortunately for us the most hated sentry or rather workman on the job got one in on us for he got away with the girl - and so we lost our first chance of acquiring the knowledge of vital importance to ourselves.

The German rolling stock was in a very bad condition as also were the points. It was a common thing for a goods train to jump the points and thereby delay traffic considerably.         The male shortage was very noticeable. Women were to be seen firing on the railway engines, doing navvying work and all manner of heavy manual work.         I may be wrong in my conjecture but with the majority of the women we came in contact with at Dusseldorf, always at a distance, there seemed to be a strong feeling of sympathy existing between we Englishmen and them, although in
