quite satisfied with 1/25th what he asked.
I went to the Kursall last night, after dinner at the Continental.It is a Vaudeville show, but not nearly as good as the National. Most of the items were in Frency or Italian and were only mediocre. We bolted to catch our 12.30 train, yelling &quot;Egre, egre&quot; (faster faster) to the Gyppie driver of the carriage. We were going full gallop along the glass-smooth street to Pab-el-louk station when one of the horses slipped and the whole caboose tumbled all of a heap. We shot the struggling driver 6 piastres and jumped out onto the train. Just caught it.
For some reason the Australians always make the Gyppies drive drive full speed through the streets. Its fine fun, for the little Arab horses clatter along at a great bat. One night I saw 3 carriages racing full lick, with the soldiers belting the driver and yelling &quot;Egre&quot; Egre&quot;, which being interpreted means &quot;Faster faster&quot;. Our carriage was coming full lick in another direction and we just grazed as we passed and shaved a motor car.
30/4/14. &nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday was my birthday. My word the years are racing by. I&#39;m beginning to think it is high time I settled up and settled down. To celebrate my birthday I worked a little harder than usual. I arranged a slap-up concert in camp and as the &quot;chairman-to-be&quot; reckoned I had a good voice (for announcing not for singing) I presided the show. It was a great success. I&#39;m enclosing a programme.
Of course the big item of news here is the fight our fellows put up in the Dardanelles. When the landing was effected they encountered barbed wire entanglements and trenches with maxims. Our boys made a great bayonet charge, and drove the Turks for 7 miles. It was the 9th Battalion Infantry that bore the brunt of the attack. Without waiting for supports they never troubled to fire. They just fixed bayonets and dashed at the trenches. We have only meagre details at present, but it is believed we lost 600 killed and 2,000 wounded. The stories we get from the wounded at the base are rather conflicting. They are only scraps and snap-shots. One wounded Turk asked an Australian for a drink and gave him his water bottle. Then the Turk drew his revolver and shot the Australian dead. Then 4 of our chaps got the Turk and cut him to pieces. Another Turk in the trenches fired till the Australians were right on him and wounded a few. Then the moment our fellows got to the trench he dropped his rifle and held up his hands in surrender; but our chaps would not stand that. They bayoneted him on the spot. From all accounts the Australians behaved with wonderful dash and courage and the bayonet charge should put the fear of Australia into the Turks. We have sent reinforcements to fill up the gaps in our ranks and at last we hear definitely that our brigade is to move off very soon, and that some English Yeomanry are to take on our job of guarding Egypt.
1.5.&#39;15. &nbsp;I&#39;m just back from the base hospital where all the Australian wounded are being taken. Saw the Red Crescent train steam in loaded with our fellows back from the Dardanelles. They all seemed wonderfully cheerful and happy, smoked cigarettes and yarned about their experiences. There is no doubt our fellows fought wonderfully well.
It was a great sight to see the slightly wounded march from the train to the hospital. They mostly were shot about the arms, or scalp. Their uniforms had dried blood all over them and were torn about where the field doctors had ripped off sleeves etc. to get at the wounds. As they marched irregularly along one chap with his arm in a sling, and a flesh wound in the leg limped behind and/
