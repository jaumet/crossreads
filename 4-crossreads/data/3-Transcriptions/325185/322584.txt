<p>Dear Father<br/>Arrived here yesterday morning.  Had a very fair trip there was a bit of dirty weather on the coast but didn't last very long.  I am storekeeper now also have the smokeroom &amp; bar. Mr White the Chief Steward left on a three months holiday in Dunedin.  Mr Buchanan is chief now &amp; Mr Anderson 2nd. I was given the store &amp;amp: smokeroom.  Will be a  bit better off now than before as it means better wages also will make a bit out of the bar.  The other boys are a bit jealous of me for getting the position.  Not that it is troubling me what they think about it.  There won't be much in it for a while as there are not very many passengers travelling just now.</p>
<p>They say things will be better when we get on the Sydney Wellington run.  It was pretty cold in N.Z this time</p>
