<p>In Flanders Fields</p>
<p>In Flanders fields the poppies grow<br/>Between the crosses, row on row<br/>That mark our place:  and in the sky<br/>The larks still bravely singing, fly<br/>Scarce heard amid the guns below.</p>
<p>We are the Dead.  Short days ago<br/>We lived, felt Dawn, saw Sunset glow,<br/>Loved, and were loved, and now we lie<br/>In Flanders fields.</p>
<p>Take up our quarrel with the foe:<br/>To you from failing hands we throw<br/>The torch:  be yours to hold it high:<br/>If ye break faith with us who die<br/>We shall not sleep, though poppies grow<br/>In Flanders fields.</p>
<p>John McCrae.</p>
