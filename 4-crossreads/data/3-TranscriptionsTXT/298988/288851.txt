 is still firing along the beach where our boys are landing. 
 The "Bacchante" and the "Triumph" have just gone in close, one on each side of the ridge behind which this gun is sheltered &amp; are pouring shells up the Valley on to it. 
 A mine sweeper just brought a horse barge alongside of us &amp; one of the crew has a phonograph playing "My little grey home in the west" 
 Where we are now lying shells were falling thick an hour ago &amp; that one gun is still firing, some of the shots falling a few hundred yards away. Our Warships are still endeavouring to silence it.  I took a photograph of a Destroyer, with as a background the destroyed fort. Also took one of the fort with the Bacchante &amp; Queen shelling it. The name of the point where the fort was is Gaba Tepe. They are still banging away so I must go &amp; have another look. 
 8.50 a.m.  The Ships are just firing an occasional shot now, but the rifle &amp; machine gun fire on shore is just terrific &amp; continuous. 
 9 a.m.  The firing now seems to have ceased &amp; the Major in Command (while I write the firing starts again in dead earnest), was just saying that the Australian 9th 10th 11th &amp; 12th Battalions have taken an important hill. 
 Good old Australia &ndash; Jove just listen to that firing.  Let us hope our casualties are few.
