 27 June 1918 Thursday Last night, Jacko more active, stronger Patrols, Colored lights &amp; a lot of artillery kept us from sleeping- but don't feel so feverish this morning- RAMADAN time of fasting is now  over  on so Jacko may be feeling agressive.  The Water we use for washing out of the adjoining swamp is so salt, a mans shirt is like a board &amp; a thin white layer remains on the SKIN after washing- 1 man killed 3 wounded by Shells today- Ramadan finishes about 10th July but we are not worrying.
