<p>that I know. Bob Tree came and had a yarn with me yesterday, he is in the Camel Corps, he is a First Leiutenant now.</p>
<p>I am going to get some photos of the floor of that old Church and send you as soon as I can, the floor is 1300 years old. I do not know just when I will be able to get them to send.</p>
<p>We are not getting up now till five oclock for a while, it is alright to I can tell you after getting up at three and some times earlier. We all wish here that the War was finished. My word you should see the dug outs where the Turks used to be, they had them so deep that they could take horse and all into them and you could not see anything of them and they had trenches every where. Jack Norrish is still in Cairo.</p>
<p>My word I would like to be able to see you all and I wonder if Baby would know me, just fancy her knowing my Photo like she does, she must have a good memory. Remember me to Mrs. Logie &amp; Swains. Alie and the Boss is great pals Nell tells me. I expect Baby has improved a good deal since I left. I am buying some photos off a chap here and I will send them to you as soon as I get them, they are real Photos of Egypt.</p>
<p>Well I think I have told you all the news for this time. So I will close with sending best wishes to all. Remember me to Birt &amp; Mrs. Bilney also George [indecipherable]. Good Bye for the present</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>My Address<br/>No 3272<br/>Trooper W. V. Weaber<br/>C Troop<br/>A Squadron<br/>10th Light Horse<br/>Egypt</p>
<p>I hope Nell is still with you. I was lucky getting back to the 10th as none of the others have yet</p>
<p>Kisses for you<br/>X X X X X<br/>X X X X X<br/>X X X X X<br/>X X X X X</p>
