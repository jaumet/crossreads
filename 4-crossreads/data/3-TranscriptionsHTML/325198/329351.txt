<p>25 Aug, 1916<br/>Our Brigadier is full of cheer<br/>He shouted out "Hooray"<br/>"Youre making history" he said,<br/>And then he rode away.</p>
<p>And in this tale if you read on,<br/>You'll find out how its done,<br/>Of how old Abdul came to fight,<br/>And how a victorys won.</p>
<p>When Abdul left Damascus<br/>With an Army Corp or so,<br/>He never even asked us<br/>Permission for to go.</p>
<p>He came along the sea-coast<br/>And swanked  at Ber el Abd<br/>And uttered there a big boast<br/>Of the land that he had grabbed.</p>
<p>He marched to Ograbina<br/>And stayed there for a week<br/>As much to say "We've seen yer<br/>So don't give us any cheek"</p>
<p>And then he came to Quatia<br/>And camped around the well<br/>As much to say "We'll face yer<br/>And give yer ---- hell"</p>
