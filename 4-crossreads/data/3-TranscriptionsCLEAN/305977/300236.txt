  
 July 1915 who went out.  There was a big bombardment of Achi Baba in the afternoon.  It was a great sight, but I wouldn't have given much on being there.  More trench digging at night. 
 Tuesday 13th We did nothing during the day but it was too hot to sleep.  Our regiment got 60 reinforcements.  "A" Squadron was digging at night & "B" Squadron formed a covering party.  We had 4 hrs out in front & the Turks put in a very heavy fire.  We could hear them talking & their covering party moving in the bushes.  We came back to camp at 4am & I felt pretty tired. 
 Wednesday 14th Was on water fatigue in the morning.  Had a fairly busy day & no time for sleep.  Had to go out on covering party again at night.  Was relieved at 12.30am but got no sleep
