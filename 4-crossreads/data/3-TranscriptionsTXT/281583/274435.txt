 Some of the heads came up &amp; paid us today although what we can do with money out here is a mystery to me. The mud is now knee deep again &amp; very hard to walk in on account of it being slippery. 
 20.11.16 Monday 
 The weather still continues to be very cold, with alternative showers of icy cold rain thrown in. We had plenty of German shells to keep us company last night &amp; the way they whistled through the air, fairly made me sick. The naval guns close by us opened up at about 9 pm &amp; kept at it for a couple of hours making sleep impossible.  They silenced Fritz however as he was afraid of giving away his position. 
 Our supply trains have not arrived so far &amp; we have advice that they will not reach here until 1am in the morning. This is not very pleasant as it means unloading &amp; checking in the dark &amp; slush. The only thing I am hoping is that the Germans will not send over any shells, as it is hard to watch everybody at night. 
 Just as I am waiting a few observation Balloon are going up. This as usual means more shelling both by Fritz &amp; us. The 2nd Div are moving back to Vignacourt but I fancy we are staying here. Our Battalions are coming out of the trench &amp; moving to Becourt
