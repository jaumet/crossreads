Tea & cakes to no end in the garden arbor,  inside  which was lit up with lanterns after dark. Reading & writing rooms with abundance of literature & ping pong etc inside the house. Had fairly good time & left again at 8.30 Jolly cool for pyjamas. On nearing Luna Park the famous water schute stood out plainly in the moonlight. Its a great structure & must have afforded much amusement when in full swing.
