<p>up here as the Dr would not pass her yesterday.  I was hoping to be on the bridge going through the canal, but am afraid I am doomed to disappointment.<br/>One of the guards called on a boat (that was coming along side) us to halt some time during the night &amp; as the boat did not stop quick enough to suit him he fired a shot over him which brought the boat to a halt very lively.  as it happened the boat contained the pilot that was going through the canal with us &amp; he went ashore again &amp; it was 1.30 before we could get a pilot &amp; lift anchor.</p>
