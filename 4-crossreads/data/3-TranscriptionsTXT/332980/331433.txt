continued on, but had not got far when another Fritz came over, also dropping a light, on coming to the next stop which was against me I stopped & the French Guard noticed a Dug Out near the Signal in the Cutting & we all scampered into it, when Fritz started unloading all around us, making the Dug Out tremble with the Explosions, it is an awful sensations, you can hear the Bombs & Torpedo's coming down with a hiss & then a loud report, one does not know where the next one will fall, & we have to take our chance like the rest of the Boys about. After this Machine had cleared out after a pummelling & I received the signal & soon was off again, but only got as far as Chocques when another Machine came over & I we had to wait for the Signal, the Guard soon cleared out & my Mate & myself this time remained on the Engine as we could see Fritz in the light & he was away from us, Bombing, after receiving the Signal to proceed the Guard would not come any further with me he was very nervous & shaking like a leaf.
