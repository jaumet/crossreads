<p>Sat. May 25<br/>Paraded to orderly room with my kit, and was informed that I was in charge of the party for Weymouth, 8 men and myself. We went to Warminster station in a motor-bus. Left there at 10.58 and went as far as Westbury. Here we had to change trains. We got some refreshments on the station, which were very welcome as we had to wait an hour for a train. Arrived in Weymouth about 2.15. A no. of us went to Westham Camp by motor, the remainder had to walk. I rode. Here our particulars were taken and we were told off to Huts.</p>
