<p>[Saturday 18 March 1916]</p>
<p>Life jogs on here much as usual chased 4 Camels today, but they went West, double outposts tonight, but many Tourists would pay good money to lead the life we are doing.  Spent the evening Condoling with Sef Bey conversation as follows-<br/>"We hope you are getting over your"<br/>" trouble"  (all thro' Interpreter)</p>
<p>"Your visits make my burden light, it is the will of God"</p>
<p>We hope our men are behaving themselves in the villages &amp; on patrol,</p>
<p>All the Notables of the Province speak highly of yourselves &amp; your soldiers &amp; children remember them in their prayers<br/>etc, etc:<br/> Throw bouquets at each other &amp; then more coffee &amp; a cigarette &amp; we leave</p>
