The Third contingent arrived at Alexandria & J Canduff is L.S.M.with Len Scorer as hq Corporal the [indecipherable] waggons have sprung bottoms & are real good for now all spring will out of the waggon. The 10 Reg came along with them but the 8th & 9th are to follow 8 days later. I had to take stand by for Toby & had a run at 10 to Mena. A beautiful night for a spin & I got back at midnight. I took Toby's machine & jolly near stuffed his gears, he & J Hobbs received an urgent letter asking them if they would accept a comm. in the [indecipherable] Army. They replied in the affirmative. Divisional Scheme today & we for a change had a win against the Tommy's. Bed at 10.13 March 1915SaturdayRevielle 6 pmStill another trip to Cairo for the C.O. Joc Gillies has at last got his promotion & is now a Sergt at present he is down with pains in the body, & has to be sent into a hospital to recupperate. At lunch time Tom Freeman putts in an appearance & delivers Nells message to me.
