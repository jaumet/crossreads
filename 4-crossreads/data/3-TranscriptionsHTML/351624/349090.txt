<p>Battalion rations far superior.<br/><u>Monday 25th</u> A quiet doubtful day. Some of our number sent to convalescent camp this morning. Kept in suspense regarding England till 5 p.m., then the issue of additional clothing for boat trip cleared away all doubt. Cap comforter cardigan jacket and warm socks provided for journey. Met a young chap called Allen Lindsay. He is a son of Lindsay late of Victorian Railways. He is being sent up for medical board.<br/>Came across another mate in my own battalion Disher son of a S.M. at Mordialloc, he hopes soon to be returned to Australia being one of the originals. Joe is now quietly smoking my cigarette issue in bed. What a contrast, those snow white sheets that coal black head. He has been exceptionally happy today.<br/><u>Tuesday 26th</u> Still improving. Exceptionally cold all day. Still waiting for that ticket. Tomorrow should see me clear of this place.<br/><u>Wednesday 27th</u> At 4 a.m. we are awakened for our morning wash. At 5 a thermometer is thrust into our mouths. At 7 we dine.</p>
