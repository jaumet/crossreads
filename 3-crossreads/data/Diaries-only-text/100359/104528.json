was very necessary as it was getting rather warm, and the gallant 8th were losing more sweat than they had ever done before. It was not bad walking generally, but now and then we struck patches of loose sand, into which we sunk, over our boot tops and was very hard on the transport horses. Before we started we were given strict orders to be very careful with our water, the wisdom of which proved itself, before we had gone many miles. We halted at 11.30 for dinner, which consisted of Bully Beef and Biscuit a little jam, and water, the water in our bottles was quite hot, but all the same it was worth its weight in gold. During our dinner spell, a few hundred Arabs sprang up from somewhere, and hung around waiting for what was left of our "banquet". The transport waggons had kept up with us, and it was very nice to have even their shade as the sun was blazing hot by this time. We did not start off again till about 1 o'clock and this spell gave the stragglers from the Infantry a chance to catch up with their units again. We had not gone far when the poor old Infantrymen began to drop out with sore feet, and generally knocked up, so our O.C. Col.Shepheard sent some of us out in Stretcher squads to assist them, as much as possible. Lorry Trousdale was No. 4 in our squad, which consisted of Stan Wright, Billy May and myself. We had the First Aid satchel with us, also a Field Service Water bottle, and the chaps who fell out were very glad of a drink of water and a sprinkle of Boric Acid for their feet.
