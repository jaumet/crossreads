April 1
April’s Fool Day. I wish someone would perpetrate a joke on me and make me laugh. I don’t feel much like it myself lately. Yesterday I had a walk through the Camp and was surprised to see how few were left. It is going to be filled up by Tommies, in a few days. Some General was round inspecting the Camp today. It is always made specially clean and tidy for these events – Had afternoon tea (cocoa) at Y.M.C.A. again with Jack Dexter. Leaving here on Monday.

We have been packing up all day ready to move off in the morning. I am staying behind till the end with Capt. Marshall only a few hundred Australians will be left in this Camp then – all Australians have to be out of Cairo by Mercredi. I think my Brigade is going to Moaska on this side of the Canal about a mile from Ismailia – I am still without an M.O. Moved down to Station and slept there

Left Tel-el-Kebir about 7 am. Drove round Ismailia with Capt Marshall - He took a great liking to me and shouted one all round town. Went into Camp at Ferry’s Post. Saw the boys of 15th Fld Amb tonight. Made me feel quite homesick. Slept with Crop tonight. I’m very much afraid I would much rather be back with the boys – It’s a jolly hard matter to leave them and one gets to know a man thoroughly on active service.

Rejoined my Unit at Moaskar this morning walking 6 miles with all my pack. Saw Russ & Edric today They are in the D.A.C. and only about 100 yards away. This is an awful camp No water or anything. I am helping Capt Robinson M.O. of the 15th Bdge at present. A very nice little Doctor.
