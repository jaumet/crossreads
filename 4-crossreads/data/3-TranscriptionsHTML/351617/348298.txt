<p>day while we were there. Bayonet exercises, marching, saluting &amp; assault were all gone through, &amp; although they were not very heavy it was enough to make us very tired, as it was all done in the loose sand.</p>
<p>I experienced two sand-storms while I was there &amp; it was look after your food then. The only thing to do was get in the tents &amp; wait till it finished &amp; in both cases, down came the tents on top of us as the pegs would not hold in the loose sand.</p>
<p>Except for a few little incidents such as these, everything went along OK until the night of the 3rd of June, when our Sergeant came &amp; poked his head into the tent &amp; told us Reveille would be at 3 am next morning to pull down all our tents as we were moving to England to undergo training before going to France.</p>
