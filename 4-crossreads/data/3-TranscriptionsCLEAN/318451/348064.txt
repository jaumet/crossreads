  
 Saturday Feb. 3rd Today has been cold again & the frosty weather shows no sign of clearing.  It keeps dry & clear.  I went to the Canteen at Houplines today.  We had a record days takings over 1100 Fr.  I got home dog tired.  Capt. McLean called. 
 Sunday The only parade I had was at the Transport, about 50 men gathered in the blacksmith shop & we had a real hearty service.  I took part at the Y.M.C.A. service in the evening. 
 Monday Have been to Canteen again today.  Weather still cold & glass below freezing.  Matters have been fairly quiet for a few days now.  Germany's last card is about to be played, i.e., the "ruthless submarine war".  Neutral vessels have been warned that they will be sunk at sight if found in the zone laid down
