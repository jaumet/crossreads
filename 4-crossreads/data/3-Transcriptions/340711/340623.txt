<p>Bryan etc. had a good swear. But on the whole I reckon it was creditable for untrained men anyhow. We passed through Hazebroucque and some villages and arrived at Croix-du-Bac at about 2.pm. The "humpies" evacuated by the Tommies were indescribably filthy, and the ventilation is a door at one end. The smell was like the Eboe's hold. The day was beautiful.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 11.<br/>Another fine day. A little cottage nearby serves me for a home I was one of the first there and have again struck right. I have three meals a day there. Little Clothilde and Marie---they are bonny youngsters. Horses are watered three times a day at a water hole a quarter of a mile away. McDonald growling---"F. Sub always behind".</p>
<p>Wednesday, 12.<br/>Very wet and cold. Usual routine. F. Sub first---still McDonald not satisfied. Exercised horses afternoon---men riding one and leading two. Rained all the time. Orderly Sergeant. Bryan on Tuesday night read out orders at <strike>7.pm.</strike> 7.30pm. In the course of his remarks he warned men against women; "But if", he said, "you must have that sort of thing, I would advise you to use your fingers---at all events you will get more pleasure that way." He is a rotten filthy cur. I thought his two junior officers Lewis and Meates, would have knocked him down, they looked so wild.</p>
<p>Thursday, <strike>14</strike>. 13.<br/>Went with McDonald to Brigade Headquarters and 21st and 17th on right (before coming to 18th and 16th on left, with fine avenue of ormes and two black faced barns). He growled again I was ten minutes late---when I was not. He left me Orderly Sergeant's job and this other affair as well. He also is mad. Column, commencing from 9.am to be 2 sections, Right and Left, and 4 Subs, A.B.C.D. I am transferred to B.</p>
