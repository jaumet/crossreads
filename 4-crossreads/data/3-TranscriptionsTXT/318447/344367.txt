Feb 2ndThe rain is over &amp; we have had a few perfect days but tonight a gusty wind is blowing a hurricane  I am afraid my home will not stand it. I am afraid we are in for the usual monthly wind which generally lasts three days.

I am still here eating Lotos off a tin plate &amp; having a very quiet if hardly hilarious time.
My day is usually spent thuswise
