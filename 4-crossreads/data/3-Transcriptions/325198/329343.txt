<p>"Pinched from Rowdy book"<br/>my Creed</p>
<p>I would be true for there are those who trust me,<br/>I would be pure for there are those who care.<br/>I would be strong for there is much to suffer.<br/>I would be brave for there is much to dare.<br/>I would be friend to all the [pore?] the friendless<br/>I would be giving &amp; forget the gift<br/>I would be humble for I know my weakness<br/>I would look up &amp; laugh, and love &amp; lift.</p>
<p>The Road to El Arish</p>
<p>On the road to El Arish, Oh it aint the place youd wish<br/>For a picnic with your [indecipherable] or a spell<br/>For the sand flies over all &amp; your horse can hardly crawl<br/>And your twenty miles from  what they call a well<br/>And the water when you get it well you try hard to forget it<br/>For it taste as if it 'ad been drunk before<br/>And the sun is over head pourin down like molten lead<br/>Why the 'ell did El Arish come in the war<br/><strike> Why the 'ell did El Arish come in the war</strike></p>
<p>Tommo reccomends this sung to the tune of the "Honeysuckle &amp; the Bee". he comes at it after the "sixth"</p>
