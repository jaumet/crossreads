<p>moving British Troops coming out of action made our progress along the roads very slow.  German Prisoners.  Every<strike>thing</strike> living creature is covered in mud.  Guns booming from all directions.  We gradually made our way round the hills along these muddy roads, over trenches &amp; shell holes to a spot on the northern side of Mametz woods.  Lucky to get in with Tommies and sleep for the night in a floored hut.  18" gun on the railway line.  Numbers of others on different branches of the railway now being pushed forward.</p>
