<p>Spend evening at the Kursaats (French Vaudeville Entertainment) where the various items are so different from our Sydney Tivoli. Seeing some of the side lights of Cairo afterwards &amp;  meet a chap from the "Argyllshire" who insists on shouting for me  &amp;  paying for a carriage drive home. Very nice indeed.</p>
<p>12th Nov:-<br/>Duties as usual &amp; rather hard work. Dull day &amp;  very hot. My shoulder gives trouble &amp;  the doctor orders it to be massaged daily. Light duties.</p>
<p>Visit Cairo &amp;   accidentally meet de Mestre &amp; a Scotch Tommy &amp;  we have an argument abut the respective merits of Australian &amp;  English soldiers. Meet some A.M.C. friends who are leaving for the front next day  &amp;  we have a good time</p>
