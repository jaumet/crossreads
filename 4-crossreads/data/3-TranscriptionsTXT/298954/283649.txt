Wed 22nd (cont.)I lunched (mit Posten) in the 1st Class Potsdamerbahnhof cafe, having absolutely refused to enter the 3rd class cafe.
Strange to say, there was no objection to the "Englische Herr Offizier" entering the 1st class cafe, the objection was to my escort entering the Sacred Precincts!
Since the "Herr Offizier" said he would rather be taken to "Strafe" than enter a 3rd class cafe the objection to my poor old Landsturmer was waived, as a special concession I lunched amongst such gold-lace and well cut mufti on a Libby's veal loaf & biscuits, giving my guard a small tin of sardines and a glass of beer.
The waiter's (ex-London Hotel) eyes bulged when I gave him the remainder of a packet of cocoa as a trinkgeld after he made me a pot from same.
