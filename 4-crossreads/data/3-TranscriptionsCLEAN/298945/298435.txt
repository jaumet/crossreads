  
 dug-outs. Many dead Fritzes & Australians lying in & around the town. The latter were mostly buried the day of our arrival, but the former were left till later, for there were still some about when left on Tuesday morning. There were even live men in the cellars in Sate. 
 Peronne is smashed utterly. Hardly a habitable house remains. This is not remarkable, for in this war alone it has changed hands three times. Dead Fritz in Town Hall. 
 Left Peronne on Tuesday, in a miserable drizzle, & tramped across country to a main road, which we followed through Hamel (a new Hamel) & the smashed remains of Marquaix to a  relay post  the other side of the last village. This relay post was to be the new A.D.S. We took over from the 11th Field Ambulance.
