<p>7.6.15<br/>Mon. 7th.  The latest rumor is that a peace conference is being held in Constantinople at present.  A sheet of paper is printed here daily &amp; pasted up on the beach for the benefit of the troops, the news it contains is practically about what we are doing &amp; can see;  there is practically no news of the fighting in France, &amp; as we are about 3 miles from the beach &amp; my cold is too bad to go in swimming at present, &amp; have no opportunity to read the "Peninsular Press".  Received more pills this morning from the Dr. &amp; they seem to be doing my cold good.  On duty at 12 oclock.  Mylie Edwards is brick to keep the papers up to me as he does every mail.</p>
