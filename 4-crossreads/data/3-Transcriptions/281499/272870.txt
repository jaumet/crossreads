<p>food for 3 days, they can't get through our shell fire it is too severe.<br/>About 200 tons of coal have gone past here towards the firing line today, the railways are very busy getting munitions &amp; etc to the guns &amp; men.<br/>I notice we are using a lot of old Fritz's little wicker baskets to pack our shells to the guns in, they go by mule pack each mule carrying 8  18 lb shells, it is the only way they have a chance of getting it to some of the guns during the wet weather even then the mules have a struggle to get through the vile sticky stuff<br/>Those 2 chaps who were sentenced by Court Marshal to 15 &amp; 2 years gaol are still with us &amp; I believe they have to go in the trenches &amp; do their bit, that's what they want for a certain class only get into trouble so as they will get clinked &amp;</p>
