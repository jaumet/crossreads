BROADMEADOWS,14/11/15.We are members of the Sergeants' Mess, where we have a sit down meal with an Orderly to wait on us. The men,however, as far as we can see, sire not at all fairly treated.Breakfast and dinner, nearly always stew, badly cooked and very economically distributed-&#151;about half as much as they received at Mitcham. The organization is very poor. The men were pretty mutinous. They all want to get back to Mitcham. Things may improve-&#151;and give them a chance to settle down&#151;I hope so. It blows gales here mostly all the time&#151;tons of dirt. We sleep in tents&#151;the centre pole of ours, also another, broke today. When we arrived in Melbourne (after a bitterly cold night) it was all dust&#151;on arrival at Broadmeadows,(about 12 miles out) it rained&#151;since then it has been dust and gales&#151; just now, and quite unexpectedly a fierce hail storm is raging. The blankets I h ave are miserable things&#151;short and thin&#151;-not half as good a s the old Exhibitioners.We are now out at Williamstown Musketry Ranges, about 10 miles from the City, a small and clean camp, but we have a rotten O.C. No time for anything. He is not much over 20, a snob, a cad, inexperienced and with a supreme desire to show his authority. He seems to have a down on Will and I, but I got a couple home on him yesterday and he actually had the decency to beg my pardon, but of that more anon. 0's0. can make a hell for the men if they like, and this man seems to take a delight in it-&#151;the first I have ever struck of his kind.
