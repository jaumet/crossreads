<p>A few days ago the Germans shelled a church within 500 yds of here &amp; killed the local priest besides four civilians, included in the casualties was a baby. The 1st shot hit the steeple &amp; down it came.</p>
<p>This tabernacle was in a small hamlet miles behind the line &amp; was used by the Huns only to range their gun on. When they got the distance then they started on perhaps a legitimate target.</p>
<p>Personally, I think they would not have done the damage (at least, for economical reasons) if they had know the distance to the target which had some military importance but it shows how little they stick at destroying churches, which are usually the highest point in a village, &amp; consequently a good aiming mark for the mathematical calculation of gunnery targets. It is only the carrying out, I suppose, of the teachings of Moltke &amp; Bismarck which are still in their military text books, to make war a success &ndash; make it morally, terrible.</p>
