 8/7/17 . Went to see the unviel of the Pozier Memori . There was a good deal of rain all day . The memori is a simpl affair ; a small granit column with an inscript plate , erect not far from where the villag onc stood . It is hard to recognis the posit again , for grass has overgrown everyth where I thought grass could never grow again . 11/7/17 . There was some ceremoni drill today , they must be expect some Head along . yesterday , there was a demonstr with a German " Flammenwerper" , ( "Flame Thrower " ) As I have alreadi seen these engin in actual battl it was no novelti . This dread weapon throw a "jet " of wither flame about 90 feet ; but it is easili dealt with .
