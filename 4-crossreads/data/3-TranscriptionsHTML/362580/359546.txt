<p>I don't think the book you got will be nearly large enough for the snaps.  But it will do for the present.</p>
<p>Glad Jane had such a nice birthday &amp; now dear old Mother's is over, next will be mine.  I did hope to be home before this but shall be an old woman by the time I return.  If I could only get to see my Beloved for a little while I should then try hard to get back to see you all.  You know it is very hard to have two strings pulling at ones heart.  Lover &amp; Home.  Well, my dearest Mother &amp; sisters I'm very well &amp; have lots of love for you all.  Hope you are all well &amp; happy.  Heaps of kisses.</p>
<p>From<br/>Edith.</p>
