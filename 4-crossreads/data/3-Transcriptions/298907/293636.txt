<p>Sister why certainly she can come if she wishes I said, cant be a bad sort I should think after that. This morning I got a letter from Len telling me he will be up most likely tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Went down &amp; got our clothing today a motor took us down &amp; back, we did not get a very good rig out but it will do us, then after dinner a party of us went out &amp; had a look round the city, she is a fair size next to London I should think, her streets a very narrow &amp; twisting &amp; the trams are nearly all old double-deckers, being a Wednesday most of her shops were shut only the high class ones being open, &amp; into one of these I went to buy a few little things for my tunic such as chevrons stripes badges &amp; etc</p>
