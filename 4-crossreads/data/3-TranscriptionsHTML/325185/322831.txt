<p>Dear Father<br/>Have received a couple of letters from you just recently. My mail appears to be all jumbled up at present as the letters are coming in ones &amp;amp: two &amp;amp: all dates. But the date doesn't make any difference it is a case of it is Australian that is the main thing. Received one letter of yours last night dated the 5th Jan I was awfully sorry to hear Sloane had been killed. Had been wondering why he didint write me little did I know he had paid the price. You are wondering why you were notified of his death. Well I shall try &amp;amp: explain as far as I can. Sloane wasent his name ,his proper name was 0'Cane, why it was changed I don't know. We were great pals on the   "Maunganui"  but he dident tell me any of his past history &amp;amp: I never asked for it. Well when we sailed on the Maunganui with the troops, Sloane made a will it was left with the Public Trustees Wellington N.Z. I don't know what he had to leave or anything else but he said at the time if anything happens me you</p>
