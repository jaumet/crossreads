Awakened 1am and left for hospital train in motor ambulance. Great bustle and stir, old Irving the orderly, came running after me with my belongings. Strong sister directing operations ? a splendid woman. Three hours train journey landed us at Calais and stretcherbearers soon had all embarked on a small steamer there ready to leave with the tide at noon. The waterside appears busy with the grime of coal and engines and big cranes. It is a sunny clear day with a slight breeze, just such a day as the chalk cliffs of Dover are visible from here. I am lying between decks with my wounded thigh preventing me from moving and therefore unable to see if the same view as Caesar showed his legions is still obtained in these days. The noise of big guns was very plain both here and at Etaples during the night. At 1.30 we cast off from the pier and turned towards Dover ? a 1  hr. run
