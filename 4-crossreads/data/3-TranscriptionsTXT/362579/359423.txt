My dearest Family,
To my delight me parcel has just arrived   &  I've opened it. The cake looks beautiful, shall sample it soon. The short-breas is very nice but a good deal knocked about, still it is good. The cocoanut is the worse for travelling   &  sad to say must turn it down. The Ginger is quite alright. The Flagss, Eddy's painting's   &  beads are grand. I'm that pleased
