<p>Sun. April 1st   Last night we had quite a full house.  3 of our Sergeants &amp; 4 of the 15th camped in our Hut &amp; kept the place lively till all hours.  <br/>This morning they went away to an officer's School.   After Tea George Hand &amp; I went into Albert again &amp; had a "petit [beeras?]" .  It is most amusing.  For &frac12; Franc we get a Pork &amp; Beans tin of Beer &amp; for un franc we get a Butter Tin Full.  The Town is full of Tommies.  It's rotten not getting any mail.  We are beginning to wonder what's gone wrong.  I commenced a Letter to France, but I'm hanged if I know what to put in it.</p>
<p>Monday 2.  Cold bleak wind.  About midday is snowed very heavily.  Last night a Fritz plane came over &amp; dropped a bomb in the Town.  Evidently they are after H.Q. but they missed badly &amp; did no damage whatever.<br/>Tonight we got some new Music from Blighty, so now we can go ahead with a new Programme.</p>
<p>Poor old M.S.  I wonder if she is getting my Letters alright, I hope so.</p>
