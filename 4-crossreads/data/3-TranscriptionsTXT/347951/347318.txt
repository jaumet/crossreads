Place names are often misspelt and not all place names mentioned are positively identified or confirmedThere is frequent mention of friends Sive and Jimmy (or Jimsy/Jinny/Jinmy) Fraser but the spelling of the latter's first name is not clear.With regard to the diary itself:The writing is often difficult to read and some parts appear to have been overwritten, possibly at a later date. Entries are brief and sometimes cryptic and punctuation is erratic. ]
