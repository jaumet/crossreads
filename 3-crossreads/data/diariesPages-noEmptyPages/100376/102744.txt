Mentone, Monte Carlo. We got a splendid reception all along the way. A stop was made by the train on the sea shore near Mentone. No sooner had the train stopped than out jumped the men in hundreds and stripping themselves quickly they plunged into the briny.
We passed Monte Carlo in the darkness.
About 10 p.m. we entered Italy.
Sept. 30th
When we awoke this morning we found ourselves well into Italy at a place called Savona where we were taken in charge by the Electric engine. Very high mountains in these parts.
Had a long stop at Geneva. It is strange to see the many large towns built high up on these mountains. These mountain sides are well cultivated apparently with vines and fruit trees.
The houses are all painted a yellow or pink colour. They look cheap like. Even paintings are done on the houses but to my mind they are not artistic.
The Italians have a peculiar way of waving their hands. They hold up their hand with the back to you and bring their fingers forward
