<p>December 1916<br/>(21st continued)   afternoon I had to go down to the 14th Field Ambulance to have it dressed &amp; to be innoculated with 500 A.Ts. for Septic poisoning.<br/>There is a very strong wind blowing now &amp; has been blowing sheets of iron about for the last half hour, but no serious damage has been done.<br/>I heard to-day that Murray Smith my old pal who was in the 6th F.Coy. was killed about 3 weeks ago, about 2 miles behind us.  A shell burst in his dug-out, killing two others &amp; wounding about a dozen.<br/>22nd   I have to get my arm dressed twice a day &amp; havent been feeling too well after the innoculation.
