Hughes & James are the Officers beforementioned engaged in grave registration & photography.
The said Dinkum accompanys me carrying my painting gear, himself and odd bits of salvage on a pack mule a female with of character.  I ride a very ugly plug, a small draughthorse which though unspeakably plain is useful & has a fondness for the mule.  The mule breaks loose every 15 minutes or so when we camp for painting & the Dinkum shows the stuff he's made of by sliding down the side of the precipice & catching her, tethering her by some special stunt which he says will make her feel as happy as a Jew on the hobs of hell.  Then he climbs laboriously back to me & by the time he reaches my summit she's off again, quite a good circus for a grey day.[Drawing]If the weather serves we move on, after mungaree, to the neck & I swat at painting leaves, grass, & small pebbles into the sketch of the Neck.
