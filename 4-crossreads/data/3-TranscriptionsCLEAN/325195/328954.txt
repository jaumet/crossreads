Last night an attack was made on Courtenays in which bombs played a prominent part, the fight lasted for 15 or 20 minutes; The Turks got more than the bargained for & had to retire, I have not heard casualties; Sometime last night 60 reinforcements arrived for this Regt. several lads previously wounded being among them, the returned wounded says Egypt is much worse than here to live in, was inoculated today for Cholera.
