<p>morning and extra bearers were sent forward &amp; preparations made for the reception of plenty of casualties.  Did not get much sleep and was up at 1 a.m. when our bombardment commenced.  Three Bns. carried out the attack, <strike>and</strike> took all objectives and advanced our line 500 yards on a 4000 yard front!  Our casualties were not heavy &ndash; we put through about 170 wounded as well as 31 Germans.  Prisoners taken amounted to 400, I believe.  Our 1st Division is active too.  I have just seen in the French paper that they have taken Merris (near Bailleul) up north &amp; a couple of hundred prisoners.<br/>After 46 days at the Adv. Dress. Station the Division came out of the line yesterday.  A tent sub-division of our Amb. has opened up in a Boys' Primary School on the outskirts of Amiens.  The remainder of the Amb. has gone into a copse near Poulaineville,</p>
