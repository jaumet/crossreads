see us today & is coming to stay at the end of the week. Uncle Will is wishing he could go to the war - indeed all the men young & old are feeling they want to go.
Mrs. Nosworthy was asking about you - indeed every one does - Teddie sent her love one day when I met her, and there has come another letter from Helga which we are to forward.
Billie has a wonderful "Army medikill" corps which he rides round on an improvised train with great delight. He is looking so well again.
How is Mr. Thompson? Tell him we did enjoy the Seang - B - Liar. Also give Eric & him our kindest remembrances. Take care of yourself - I am sending sox this mail & will send some every fortnight unless you say don't. Also am sending your pocket scissors. Have just heard details of the Dardanelles fight - it seems to be a pretty tough proposition.
Hilda is to be married on June 19th & Edgar goes to Fiji about a week later.
