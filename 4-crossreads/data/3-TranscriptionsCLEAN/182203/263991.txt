  
 July 19th  1915. My dearest Mother I have just heard that a mail leave for Australia soon so must scribble a few hurried lines. Hope we shall get one to-day. I am very well & happy. Night-duty is not too bad, &  I'm sleeping rather well. No doubt you will be surprised to hear that Fred Hutching took me out to Shepherd's for afternoon tea    & then a lovely motor drive on Friday last, he wants me to try and get a late night, so that I can have dinner with him & then go to the Theatre. He is a Major now &  looks very well. We had quite an enjoyable time together, left family relations alone. There is such a lot of interesting subjects to talk about, that one does not think of small things.  I went out to the Museum on Saturday & we had a very good time. Yesterday we stayed     h  in bed most of day & then cleaned up our room. We have had great excitement these last few days 19 sisters & 10 doctors arrived from Australia. Hope we will get a little more time off.  Fondest love & kisses to you all. From                                                                                                                                Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                                                                Edith.
