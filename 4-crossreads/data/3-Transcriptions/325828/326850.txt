<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I went down the Lines this evening &amp; had a chat with Walter.  He told me what Home news there was, &amp; then settled down to a nights study.  I was glad to hear him say that you are all keeping well.<br/>I am on the Night work till the end of this week at least &amp; most likely for several weeks to come.  I have been in charge of the night shift for the last 3 nights while Percy was away, &amp; I was glad enough when he returned, as I had 2 men on whom I couldn't rely upon in the slightest &amp; it was so much extra worry.<br/>On Saturday, I went down to Sydney; I went out to Ol's &amp; was very glad to see her looking so much better.  I thought she was looking paler &amp; thinner than when I saw her last.  After dinner I went out to Botany to Percy's home.  He has a lovely little home out there &amp; in the home-life seems very happy with his wife &amp; 2 little babes.  After tea we <strike>wh</strike> went to the Presbyterian School Hall where there was a social to farewell the boys of the district who had enlisted.  Each of them was presented with a beautifully bound edition of the New Testament;   Whilst the secretary &amp; treasurer of the church who had enlisted were presented with wristlet watches.</p>
