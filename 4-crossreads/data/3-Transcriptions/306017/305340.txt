<p>a good drink of water &amp; at 3 am we marched last.  The going was heavy &amp; several times our horses could hardly get a footing going down some of the sandy slopes.  Progress was very slow about 2&frac12; miles an hour &amp; the sun very early let us know the day was going to be warm.  We sighted the enemy's patrols about 8 oclock.  Our squadron was advance guard &amp; our scouts got very close at times but as they got on one ridge the enemy would be retiring to another &amp; what is difficult to understand  they never fired a shot at our scouts.  One party left their breakfast cooking on the fire.</p>
<p>We followed for nearly an hour &amp; came upon several new wells and wooden troughs &amp; about &frac12;  a ton of wire.  The troughs we packed together &amp; burnt &amp; we threw the wire down the wells  C &amp; D Troops here took the opportunity of watering their horses &amp; it proved afterwards the best thing we did all day.  The main body did not come so far &amp; consequently did not water.  At 9.15 we turned back.  It was very hot</p>
