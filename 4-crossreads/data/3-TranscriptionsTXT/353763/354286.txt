 There's a lot of land here covered with Lantana scrub which will take some clearing  -  Everywhere you see the Taro growing  -  The sole requisite is moisture  -  It's the staple food of many Fijian natives  -  Its true name is Colocasia Antiguorum &ndash; vary=   Exulentum  -  Now Cunjevoi of the Queensland Scrub is C antiquorum so that this edible aroid is but a variety of Cunjevoi  -  The Arum lily &amp; the Taro are cousins  -  One day I'll tell you a tale of a village, eaten hut by hut full, with the Taro grown on the site of each burnt hut by the cannibal chief of a tribe  -  I got it out of Seeman  -  The acrid bulbouse  root of Taro is washed, roasted, grated &amp; made into cake or bread  -  The top is cut off &amp; replanted  -  I've seen Aroids here 6 feet high &amp; more  -  They are not the Taro though  - 
 The Yam too is a great food &ndash; like to but not a sweet potato &amp; does best on hard, sterile ground  -  It's a creeper  -  Here again it's the bulbous root that is eaten  -  A lady told me it was excellent eating  -
