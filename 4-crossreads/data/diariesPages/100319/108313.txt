23/8/18 Vecquemont
Another fine warm day. The companies paraded under the trees on the river flat and were engaged on Lewis gun and other specialist training. General Robertson came round and had a look round. It is interesting to walk around the Transport QM's department and the cooks lines. Our canteen under Sergt Kohn is running a splendid stock of all sorts of things. After lunch we had baths for the men in at Vecquemont. Word through of the 3rd Division battling away and of more prisoners passing through. Today J. Smith came back from leave and Mackinnon was evacuated to hospital. In the evening our band played a good programme down near our Y.M.C.A. tent. The troops are much bucked up by this spell and in good heart.
