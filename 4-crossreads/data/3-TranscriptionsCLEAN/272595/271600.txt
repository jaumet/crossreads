  
 Continuation of diary by Archie A. Barwick. 
 20th   This book opens at Harborne Hall & I am sitting at my favourite window surveying the countryside for it is a very nice morning & the sun is trying to break through the screen of clouds, I am going away this morning to "Harefield" but I don't expect to be there long for I am practically all right now & feel as fit as a fiddle. Left the Hall this morning at 11.30 in motors which took us to Snow Hill railway station, here they dropped the whole party & never even told us where we were going nor did they leave
