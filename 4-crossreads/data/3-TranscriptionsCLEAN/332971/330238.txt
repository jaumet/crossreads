  
 Tis my afternoon off & 6 of us are felluccering on the Nile - Very soon it will be unsafe for a month before the rising and 2 after they say it is dangerous. 
 Monday 7th  As we were driving near the Kair-el-Nil barracks last eve, a band and crowd attracted our attention & on going to see what it was found it to be the 2500 Turkish prisoners marching through Cairo - I had my little camera & took some snaps.  The poor things how tired and weary & thin they looked, such a ragamuffin lot - scarcely one had a decent pair of boots on & Their Torn & patchy semi-uniform was pitiful to see.  The British line on either side with their bayonets was quite a contrast, but nothing as far as appearance goes could top our Anzacs.  Werent we pleased to have seen them, but I couldn't get the thought of their woe-be-gone expression out of my mind & sincerely wished they would soon have a feed a bath & a rest.  I looked & gazed at them & can quite understand now why our boys bear them no animosity - really they looked so kind hearted (not like fighting men) & I'm sure they were pleased to be our prisoners. 
 Matron will be disappointed to be away - Tis the first time she has left us, & The wounded coming in.
