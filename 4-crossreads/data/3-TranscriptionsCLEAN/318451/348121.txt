  
 Electric light & replete with offices, stores and Brigade Headquarters, Telephones & furniture, all gas proof & shell proof. From our lines underground out beyond the enemy's system run tunnells to mines stored with tons of explosives all waiting the touch to explode them.  I was told it is possible to walk 16 miles underground  with  under the Bosch lines without coming to daylight.  A rather curious story was told by the same informant of a mine that was being laid by us & when the ammunition was being stored in it, after a lot of labour carrying it in, somehow the heap did not seem to get any larger.  It was found that the Bosch had tunnelled under also & had found the spot & was taking it out as we put it in so of course it had to cease.
