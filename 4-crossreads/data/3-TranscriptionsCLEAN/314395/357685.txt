Dear DadHave just returned to England after 2 days trip to France, making three times, back, since coming over here.  I enjoy very much the travelling, and so far, have landed all my drafts without losing any men.  It is now a month since I left the battery and I am becoming more resigned to the new life.  I appreciate very much being able to have a wash every day, and to be free of lice for a while.  It is worth untold gold to be able to live like a human being again, to sit down thrice daily to meals, and to have a dry bed every night.  For those reasons I might be tempted to stay another month or so, but after that I have decided to apply for transfer to my unit again.  There will be no proper peace of mind, till the whole war is over, so it is no good of me hanging on here.  If it was at a base in France I would not mind so much.  One feels nearer to the job there, but
