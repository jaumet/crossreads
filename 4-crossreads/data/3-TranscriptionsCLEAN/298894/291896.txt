  
 a curio shop then returned to camp & met Will Drummond & went around Cairo. 
 Sunday   met a friend now S. Baker who gave me two tents so shifted our quarters   We also had orders to mess with the ninth so are  in a fairway of becoming comfortable  Into Cairo at night.  Just like a weekday as Friday is the Mohommedans Sunday. 
 Monday    nil. 
 Tuesday   went to meet Will D. at Mena but he had already departed so spent the day there resting & looking at the pyramids & Sphinx will make another visit. 
 Wednesday Given duties at last.  Attended sick parade &  had to make an inventory of natives employed in Camp.  They totalled 1500. 
 Thursday 1st April  orders came to pack up & join our unit at once:  our kits were placed on a wagon & we marched to the tram where we entrained for Mena.  We arrived there to find the men out on a route march. 
 Good Friday  Church parade in morning was very disappointing.  A very imposing square was formed & General Bridge attended but service was flat, no singing worth mentioning.  Remainder of day, a holiday & spent the time doing Photos with Will. D.  At night we took candles & went through all three pyramids refusing the service of a guide.  The first pyramid Cheops was fairly easy the biggest danger being from slipping for which purpose shoes or bare feet are necessary.  The passage way is worn
