 1 Jan, 1917 Ruesatt Well its the beginning of another year &amp; a queer old start it is.  I came out here this morning with Perce Sherry &amp; a few others on a patrol.  Its a wretched day, cold &amp; windy, the sand cuts ones eyes out &ndash; Bill Talford &amp; I made a billy of soup with a couple of peasoup sausages &ndash; it was just the thing but dinner was not exactly a success as there is too much sand blowing.  We tried a game of bridge but between wind &amp; sand we had a rough spin &amp; had to turn it in &ndash; I wonder what this year will bring? its sure to be eventful; not many would be game to profecy where or how we will be situated  next New Year.  I sincerely hope we will be away out of the Sinai sands before then.  I think we will.

The desert has been turned back to front to day, the hills with straight backs to the south have straight backs to the north now &amp; curves to the south.  The track was obliterated for our return, our eyes &amp; faces were cut with the sand, it was murder.  The camp looks like as if there had been a snow storm over it, its all covered with fresh white sand
