<p>Friday 13 [12] July 1917 [1918]<br/>Scott, "Hornet Banks" one, goes out.  Mawbey, Jimmy Governer's escaped victim still in the ward.  Frank Cullen brings loads of paper (writing) out for us again.<br/>Days are hotter but quite cool enough for a blanket o'night.  Grapes, figs, melons, bananas all served in turn also strawberries.</p>
