The mess business turned out all right. Riding School signalling morning. Had leave all the afternoon till 10.45 night. Went to Arlseford by car to visit the fete which was held for Red Cross. Was not much of a show. The grounds of the house where they had the show was very pretty. The village of Arlseford is a slow show, but with plenty of pubs. Some of the boys myself got slightly mixed our car did not turn up had to walk 5 lovely miles to camp. Arrived home out of breath. Had a shower slept well.
