<p>I have not yet mentioned our fishing parties.   At each anchorage all the prisoners would spend a lot of time fishing over the rails.   The lines were made from unravelled canvas;   the hooks from bent iron.   At Sunday Island, indeed, the Commandant actually allowed a party out in a boat to fish (on parole and with machine guns trained on them.   Also, there was method in his benevolence;   most of the fish was taken for the Germans!)</p>
<p>At the Maldives huge fish of the most brilliant colours were caught, gorgeous things weighing anything up to 50 lbs and coloured more brilliantly then parrots.</p>
<p>One species resembled an enormous bream and the scales were coloured in dazzling deep salmon tints.</p>
<p>As a rule each table caught fish for itself.</p>
