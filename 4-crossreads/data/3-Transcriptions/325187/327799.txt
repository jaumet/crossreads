<p>[Wednesday 23 February 1916]</p>
<p>Horses arrived in daylight but the Boats stuck on mudbanks etc &amp; were late- baggage always is.  Clearing a place for a camp I unearthed a brown snake- The moon is very full at present &amp; shining on the Canal makes a pretty picture, till broken by a dead donkey etc floating down stream  We drink this but boil first with the husks of Corn Cobs if possible-  Weather getting warmer now but nights cold-<br/>Invitation for Officers to supper at another Pasha's tonight so expect a 9 course feed of Lentils, Brains, Viciera etc.  Another dog just floated past &amp; Water Buffaloes (domestic) are swimming with a small native child trying to get them out a few hundred yards above Camp</p>
