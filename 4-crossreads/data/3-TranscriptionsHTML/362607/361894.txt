<p>Dear Dad,<br/>12.5.16  This is the working donkey. He has no pretty saddle but only two baskets to carry manure or soil &amp; rubbish. They very seldom use drays for anything but stones &amp; bricks. These drays are narrower than ours but about 3' 6" deep &amp; have real large wheels about 10 ft in diameter. A poor looking mule like Keirle's buggy horse pulls this over sandy desert for miles loaded to the top with sand or blocks of stone. You will observe the woman drawing water. These Pitchers Keep the water very cool but we have never used them after the Gippos. I will write a letter as well as sending these cards. I have finished work at 11 A.M. but must stay in my treatment hut till 12.30 pm or the Major will give me extra work.<br/>Love to all  Harry</p>
