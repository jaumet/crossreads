Bouzincourt 4/6/17
Bright warm sunny morning with the bells of the little church pealing and white robed girls with floating viels going to the church like brides ? premier communion. Rumour that the offensive started up north two days ago ? may God rest the souls of many brave men: Had a long discussion with Monsieur at the Chateau about the War, espionage, socialists etc. He becomes greatly excited when he describes their deceit and reptilian cunning. Paraded at 9.30 ? full marching order with blankets and steel helmets. Capt Webb, late South Pole Expedition, now of Engrs. gave a lecture on strong posts to "DCo while "C" practised rapid wiring. A B the same in the afternoon. Four Vickers gunners also reported and our Lewis men were much interested ? some animated arguments commenced re their respective merits. We should go in this time with nearly every man trained right up in the Lewis gun bombs or other specialty. After lunch
