<p>Visit to Havre</p>
<p>Sun. Aug. 19 (cont)  We arrived in Havre about 2.20.  It is a beautiful city, quite the best place we've struck in France.  Saw a no. of dirigibles cruising along the coast, also quite a lot of sea-planes.  It was a grand day.  The town reminded me very much of St Kilda.  We walked down to the Beach &amp; spent a very enjoyable half hour in the water.  There was quite a big crowd in the water including quite a number of mdd'elles.  It was quite  like old times.  There is a good dressing shed run by the military, where one can obtain swimming togs. &amp; towel for 2d.  It just wanted old B.E. there to make it a perfect day.  We sat on the Beach for a while &amp; enjoyed a sun Bake.  The only drawback to the Beach is that its big pebbles instead of sand, &amp; is rather hard on one's feet.</p>
<p>About 4 we adjourned to a very nice caf&eacute; &amp; had afternoon Tea.  Then we took a stroll through the city.  There are some very fine Public Buildings &amp; the City is well laid out.  Electric Trams.  Had a good Tea.  Eggs, Salad, Bread &amp; Butter.  After that we strolled through some of the most interesting parts of the Town.  Visited a big caf&eacute;, &amp; watched them playing French Billiards for a time.  French Billiard Tables  have no pockets, &amp; it is a novelty to watch a game in progress.<br/>We struck up a yarn with a Belgian officer &amp; his wife, &amp; then he asked us to join him in a drink &ndash; which we did.  I asked one of the waitresses if they had any Lager, but she couldn't compre my French.  I was just giving it up as a bad Job when a girl came to my rescue, &amp; acted as interpreter.  We got the Lager &amp; everybody was all smiles.  Had a most exciting Tram ride back to Camp.</p>
