Military & ships officers at the other end. The pomp kept up during war time which is no doubt rediculous viz. Saloon dinner 6.30 pm. Nurses line up one side of entrance of 1st Saloon. Officers on the other awaiting the Captain & O.C. to come down. often late, 10' or so to wait then in they go. All follow. Standing up prayers & then meal. All has to wait for the O.C. to finish he gets up, all get up as if a bomb struck the ship.Well considering it is war time & going through the submarine zone. Everyone should spend the least time possible for meals & spend all their spare time in a handy spot for the boats in case of emergency.Personally I have a captain R.C. priest & two Lieut at my table being one of the officers the waiters & refered to them re this pomp which is unnecessary. Those mentioned are very agreeable persons & having sat with them for 6 weeks I found them to be splendid Britishers & Australians & all agree with me re the fallacy.Well sailing at night all lights out. Not a sign of a light anywhere otherwise than at the Binocle compass for the Steerman. The lookout's posted gunners taken on in watches. Shells & charges in the 4 inch all but the cap. All ready for emergesy. Gun crews drill 24 charges & shells in racks near same.
