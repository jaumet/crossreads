 all they had to cross a little river and they were in Belgium. I was always eager to see the trenches and to say well I had been in the Front line of Trenches. So without permission Scotty and I went&nbsp;and visited the Trenches. Sept 23rd was the day and the Scotties were still in the line so we had a straight go after about half an hours walking down plank avenues running across open roads, round different corners. We got to the front line and we were given a look at Fritz&#39;s front line and wire through a periscope. the trenches were 250 yards away, one felt like putting his head over the top and having a good look round, but Fritz might have had objections. We had a yarn to the Scotties in the line and then made our way back.
