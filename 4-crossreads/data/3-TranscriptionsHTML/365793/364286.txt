<p>July 2 girl in grey is jolly nice. Went to Church at 6.30 good Minister.</p>
<p>3 Left for Monte Video Camp, &amp; am now in a hut with the other unfits. We are supplied with beds, do no parades &amp; have our meals in a special hut. It's a bit of alright after being stuck at Westham &amp; having to do Mess Orderly &amp; parades. There is a beautiful view from Hill 60 &ndash; on the left stretches the sea &amp; a long sand bank, in front, beautiful green fields, innumerable hedges &amp; scattered hamlets, &amp; to the right lies the Harbor<br/>[in margin] Monte Video</p>
