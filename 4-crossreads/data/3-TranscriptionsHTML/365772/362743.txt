<p>horseback in the Rotten Row Hyde Park. They havn't reached me yet so it will be some time before you get them. I had others taken which will be sent direct to you from the studio London. I hope they are good as I didnt see the proofs.<br/>You might think me extravagent &amp; say I am not looking ahead when I tell you the trip cost me &pound;85 not bad going for 8 days of course I had a lot of kit to buy etc. I have made arrangements to have money transferred to London by Dave &amp; the Ulmarra Bank in case I get there again.</p>
