Reveille was at 6, but we were all awake long before, Thanks to the big guns. They make a terrific noise, it is hard to realise that we are so near the fighting line. While on parade we can hear the kiddies saying their lessons, and in the paddock a woman milking the cows, and just a few miles away, there are hundreds of thousands of men doing their best to kill each other. One of our sergts. has a monkey and our picquets are kept busy stopping the big crowds of kids from overrunning the place, who come to see it. Poor old Jenny, this cold climate doesn't agree with her, and I'm afraid she'll soon leave us. We had breakfast at 7, B.B. B. and Tea. Parade at 9 and another parade at 2 (today 12 months ago, I was single up till 6 p.m. Then I joined the Benedicts (and lived happy ever after) Mac K. Mac.D Wrighty Alldis, "Miles" and I celebrated the auspicious occasion in the good old fashion way. 
Tuesday June 27
Busy day, building latrines and cutting paths through the grass, and repairing the huts, some of which leaked very badly. When we arrived at Marseilles we got a few letters of an old mail. I got 2 letters from France and a bundle of very welcome papers. It has been raining nearly all day, and there is mud everywhere. But we all prefer France with its mud to Egypt with its sunshine and sand. It is very interesting to hear these French kiddies accounts of when the Buns were here and when they tell of Germans getting captured or falling into traps, their eyes sparkle and they laugh as though iti was a huge joke. Whilst travelling in the train we slowed down at many stations and got off to fill our water bottles and other odd jobs. The conveniences are marked Hommes (men and Dames women) Payney on catching sight
