<p>1917 JANUARY</p>
<p>4 THURSDAY</p>
<p>Raining first part of the morning</p>
<p>&amp; very cold wind rest of the</p>
<p>day. We were told that</p>
<p>the 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery had been broken</p>
<p>up &amp; that the right section</p>
<p>were going to the 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery</p>
<p>&amp; the left to the 26<sup>th</sup>. We got&nbsp;</p>
<p>all packed up ready to go</p>
<p>&amp; then the order came we</p>
<p>were not moving today &amp; we</p>
<p>had to unpack it all again.</p>
<p>Clean harness &amp; grooming</p>
<p>in afternoon. I am glad</p>
<p>we are going to 26<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Battery</p>
<p>as we will have men over us</p>
<p>instead of an ignorant lot&nbsp;<s>of lads</s></p>
<p>Although I dont like the moving</p>
<p>part of it at all.</p>
