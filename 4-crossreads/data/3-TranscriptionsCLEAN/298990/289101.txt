  
 Flessells 5/12/17  Another dull and cold day.  Fell in and marched to our compact little parade ground and carried on with musketry and drill.  Nearly every man has a cold and they are like a pack of dogs barking with their coughs.  Examined some of the new reinforcement NCOs and found good talent among them in some cases.  Most of them are very smart musketry instructors and good drills.  Some are "deep thinkers" and have stuck hard to their Base jobs.  One chap Mills is extraordinarily smart on the rifle 'but' has little weight with the men who have composed a riddle about him.  "What is the difference between a Mills bomb &Mills?"  "One can be carried into the firing line & the other can't."  French save a lot of money by their organisation.  All men are called up and put into service.  Hence the road workers wear uniform and carry on with their pre-war work but only draw the low military rate of pay.  Crowds of rooks hovering about this afternoon.  The old Marquise was out walking in his wood.  The men drilled in their great-coats as there were intermittent showers.  Heard a few Orderly Room cases and took down a Summary of Evidence.  Party returned from English leave minus Sailor Parsons!  Some headings of little worries culled from notebook. Iron rations and steel helmets, Straw, Socks, substitute for postal Corporal, Duties mounting Recomm.French system, Boots, Shirts, Cardigans, Sheepskins, Hats, Box repirators etc.  The boys have been working hard so I battled for a half holiday for them tomorrow and got it.
