  
 better friends than ever & I feel a thundering sight easier in mind today than I did all through the week.  I told some of the lads about it this morning & they reckoned it was a splendid joke & one well against myself & they nearly burst their sides laughing. 
 2nd.  Ethel & I went over to Saltash which is in Cornwall, a big old ferry boat took us across & we passed dozens of destroyers all laying in line just close to Saltash bridge.  We went for a stroll round the pretty little lanes & then back by train to Plymouth.  We then went to Genom's for dinner & seated at the same table was a French commercial traveller & he told us that he had been stranded in England for a fortnight & it would be a good 30 days before he could get across so crowded are the Channel boats, he was a bit of a mixture according to what he told us said his mother was Maltese his father Italian, & he had lived in Paris all his life.
