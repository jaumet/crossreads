Revielle at 5.15
Teed up at 5.30 had breakfast at 6. Boot saddle at 6.30, the boys then trek out 5 miles to a large palm grove where the horses are to be kept during the heat of the day. I went out at lunch time took their dinners out. The day was frightfully hot I got burnt some whilst riding.
The aviation people have got an aerodrome fixed up about 2 miles N of our camp machines have been up all day.
Have had another attack of fever or rather the after effects am now not feeling too good, went over to the Doctors but I only got pills I don't think lead opium is much good for counter-acting fever.
Turned in at 9.30.
