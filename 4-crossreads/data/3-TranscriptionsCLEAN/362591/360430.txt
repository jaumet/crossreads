 My dear Father, 
 Yesterday I told you I hadn't yet received all the parcels.  Now I have.  As it happened the razor blades turned out to be the most needed.  I don't know how you think of all these things.  Generally I don't know I want them myself until they arrive. 
 I don't remember if I told you how unfortunate I was with some pay last week.  When I came to total up the sheets I found that my credit balance was 37-12-9 short.  It really serves me right, & will make me more careful in the future.  The only thing that surprises me is that instead of 37 I didn't loose 120.  Still I have not been extravagant & so am not left short. 
 As news papers are not very plentiful here I have no news to give you, so will close.  Give my love to Mother & the rest of the household. 
 Your affectionate son, Arthur
