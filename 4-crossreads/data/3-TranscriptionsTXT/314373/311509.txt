This afternoon Tad, Miers, Stewart, Shanks and myself all went to the Pyramids &ndash; The journey in was exciting enough for we had no sooner boarded the tram at the railway than we saw a corporal of the English troops killed by a tram.

Miers and I climbed to the top, the others staying behind, and our energy was amply rewarded by the glorious view. The land within our vision was divided into two vast areas of different colour divided by one long straight line reaching to the horizon, formed by the edge of the irrigation area,
