9 July, 1916Sunday  KantaraI had a good nights sleep, the Transport chaps have fixed themselves very comfortably & I was give a stretcher to sleep on; it was much better than the boards the night previous.  This morning I breakfasted well on steak & bacon & then we came on with two wagons to unload the Kit bags & dump them at the station on Rail Head side & so now, here I am, the kits all in a heap waiting for the trucks to convey them to Rail Head.  The Ser &   [indecipherable] have gone off some where so I have to stand by.
