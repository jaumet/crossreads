Sunday Nov 25Our way to water lays about 3 miles down a red road with Wattle & Gum Trees plentiful. I never expected to see this out of Australia. The Turks are shelling particularly the water so there is still plenty of excitement.Monday Nov 26Town is well occupied with Hebrews & Bedouin & swarms of Hebrews are returning with their Donkeys laden with all manner of goods. Some of the shops are reopening & the Jew is out to do business in Souvenirs & take you down if you stand  it. Jacko shelling. Auckland Reg suffered heavily taking this place
