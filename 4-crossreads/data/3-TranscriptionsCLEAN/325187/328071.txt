[Friday 24 November 1916]
Can hear the big guns firing away on the BALKANS about 14 miles away   This is a good harbour & full of Allies shipping -   Disembarked troops & took in Water.  All the Mountains are covered with clouds the highest have snow-Another Hospital ship went down last night either mined or torpedoed-   I hope these notes reach you without "getting wet"Have not been able to go ashore but can see all the town with glasses-I am afraid I won't be HOME for some time yetIt appears the War Office made a mistake in sending Egyptian Officers to Salonika & no one knows what we are to do here so we await Cable re instructions on board ship.
