<p>Syria<br/>December 24th / 18</p>
<p>Dear Auntie Sare</p>
<p>Just a few lines on the eve of Xmas to let you know I am well &amp; having a pretty good time as far as comfort is concerned, which means a good deal to a fellow out here.<br/>I really do not remember when I last wrote to you, but I know this much. That it is my turn, as your letter dated Oct 17 reached me yesterday.<br/>However now censorship regulations are moderated a little, I will try &amp; outline my movements the last few <strike>weeks</strike> months, which will make a letter a little more interesting than it was possible before &amp; give you an idea of what is really going on over on this particular part of the world.</p>
<p>If you have a map of Syria, which I no doubt you have, you will be able to follow where we have been since the Stunt started &amp; where we are at present.<br/>Well from Jaffa near the coast we went up towards the Sea of Gallilee, Nazareth Tiberius etc &amp; on to Damascus &amp; thence almost</p>
