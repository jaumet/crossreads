 Thursday August 23rd Very windy, cold day. The wind is very strong, nearly blow you away as soon as you step outside of the tent. There are about two thousand men here waiting to go back to Australia, &amp; about seventeen thousand altogether, so I suppose we will have to wait a good while before we get a sight of the boat. 
 This camp is in a very desolate part, &amp; the sooner I get out of it the better. I do not intend to go out to Portland or Weymouth, as climbing the hill back would be too much for me. The food we get is fairly good, &amp; on a whole the camp isn't too bad. It is run by non-commissioned officers, so there is a bit of "red tape". Went to a cinema in the Gym this evening, not too bad, the film kept breaking every now &amp; again. 
 Friday August 24th It is still very windy &amp; cold. My word it did blow &amp; rain last night. I was expecting the tent to blow over any minute, about seven in the lines blew over. Everyone is anxious for the expected boat-rolls to come out. Two more are expected out very soon, but then there are a terrible lot of rumors getting about. All camp is closed for leave until further orders. There is plenty of amusements in camp. Concerts etc are held in the Gym everynight.
