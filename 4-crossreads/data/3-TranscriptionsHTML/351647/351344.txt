<p>know me.</p>
<p>Your French is quite intelligible.  I am surprised at the mosquitos going "pour votre jambs.  Ils sont mechantes".  Compris?  My French is rather awful but I can make myself understood &amp; understand them when they speak slowly &amp; good French.  There is <strike>at</strike> a deal of patois about.</p>
<p>I can read the newspaper fairly well but haven't tackled a French Book yet.  Not even Le Rive or "La Vie Parisienne".  I had a walk today in a wood where a lot of heavy fighting was done not so long ago &amp; really it is marvellous to think of our chaps taking it.</p>
<p>The work those Germans put into the defences is really wonderful.</p>
<p>Glad you had a good time in Sydney.  I think I am quite jealous of the Colonel whoever he is.  Also the Chief Officer of the Mataram.  Let him stick to his ship.  I simply won't have anything to do with anything military when I come back.</p>
