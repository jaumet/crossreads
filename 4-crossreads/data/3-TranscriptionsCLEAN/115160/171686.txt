 [Printed Programme] 
 [Handwritten note] 
 I was at a vaudeville entertainment t'other night which had this as its second half.  It was the first entertainment of any sort (except a few concerts) I've been at since I left Home. 
 The big town where this programme is performed nightly is often reminded of Fritz's proximity and its state at different parts show how well he keeps track of it.
