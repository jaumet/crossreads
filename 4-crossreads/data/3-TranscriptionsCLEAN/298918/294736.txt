Listen in for press 7pm till 8.30 when retire for night.  Thus is good time being wasted; but of course the Transport officials will wake up some day, & remember they have no account of the old "Hessen" for a long while, & and will shift us on to somewhere else for a while. Everything quiet today.  Nil to relate.  [Mitchell Library stamp]
