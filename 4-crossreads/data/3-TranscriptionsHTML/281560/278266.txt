<p>1st July.1916.<br/>Went out in front with a "wiring party" last night; repairing the wire entanglements in front. It passed off all night, though the enemy's fire quickend a lot after we came in. The air squadron that passed yesterday evening returned this morning. A "Taube" attacked 7 of our planes today; but was driven off. It is said that it was Immelmann, the "Eagle of Lille". His "stoop" was unsuccessful anyway.  <br/>2/7/16.<br/>I am sleeping under the stars while my portion of the trench is being repaired. The Wide Heaven is no cover for a man these stirring times. I miss my little 6 x 2 dugout when Fritz's shrapnel is bursting over the trench. I am to go out on patrol at 11 P.M. A risky business, so I will leave this book with Wallace.</p>
