<p>12.11.16<br/>Sun 12th<br/>Jimmy Leask went to Bir-El-Abd today to see Jim Traill &amp; found he had just received a Commission in the Camel Corps. An enemy 'plane came over again today flying very high; 12 of our Aeroplane left here yesterday morning &amp; Bar [?] Sheba received the full benefit of the bombs they took out, the aeronauts profess to have made a mess of the enemy aerodromes there; McLaughlin (commonly known as Gin Gin) is batman &amp; groom to Jack Wright (RMS) &amp; keeps us well amused at meal times being one of the hardest doers I have yet met &amp; any arguments that crop up during the day is settled after tea with the gloves</p>
