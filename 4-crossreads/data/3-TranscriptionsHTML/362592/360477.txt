<p>(From Private Arnold R. Treacher, No 2301 "B" Company, 20th Battalion.)</p>
<p>15 August 1916</p>
<p>&hellip;. During those few weeks at Etaples news reached us that our Company Commander, Captain Ferguson &ndash; who is, I believe, a son of Judge Ferguson of Sydney &ndash; had been killed.  A cool, calm, fearless man he, and as such we respected him, but a truer, whiter man we never met.  His advice, his cheerfulness, his fearlessness, and his efforts to help us, we will never forget, neither today, nor tomorrow, nor yet any of the days we may spend where pluck, kindness, and ability count for anything. &hellip;.</p>
