Fell in on Monday morning & after a good deal of waiting the Dr. turned up, there were only 3 of us.  The Dr. got his stecoscope on me & tapped my chest & decided there was something wrong.  He was the same chap that marked me for the Board the day before.  Someone was hammering outside.  The Dr. cursed the noise a bit, & I think that is where my weak chest came from.  Went back & was told to stop on at the Y.M.  On Tuesday
