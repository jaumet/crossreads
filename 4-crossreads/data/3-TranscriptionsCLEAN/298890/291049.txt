21. ThursdayFog again. Arose to cold miserable house. Glad to get to office. Another trivial pottering day. Nelson S. came after 11 & kept me up to let him in. Thereby little more chill but powerful cough mix. Kept me quiet.
22. FridayGrey day again but not quite such dense twilight. Got up & got N's breakfast. Ethel appeared with news of her father's death.
23. SaturdayLunch with Fay B. Judge Mackarness [?], R Dalton & Mark. Then at Albermarle. Sun pierced the fog at lunch time for a little while. Got home at 5.30 & made black velveteen tam.
