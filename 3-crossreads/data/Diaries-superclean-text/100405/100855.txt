Dear friend
I hasten to write you this little letter to let you know that we have received the photos and that we are very pleased with them and I tell you dear friend that we thank you much. ? ? ? that you have been in sending us your news of yourself and of all your friends.
Now dear friend you tell me that you regret very much that I am not with you to do the cooking but I come with this letter to give you our good wishes, me and my husband, and to tell also to all the friends who have stayed at my house that they do not need to thank us. On the contrary, it is us who thank them very much.
And now dear friend tell all your friends who stayed with me that I would like to receive their photographs and that of their families and a little news after they have returned to Australia and from you also, so that I will not forget you, and their address so that we will be able to answer
