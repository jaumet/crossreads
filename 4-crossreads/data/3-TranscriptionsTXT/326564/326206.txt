now going for their lives "somewhere in France", with Fritzis on their heels some soldiers believe me, Oh she's a lovely war, & what a time we're having   we have just dumped our packs, in preparation for a forced march, where to I don't know, nor care much either, for its all the same to us no matter where we go, we will eventually be shot into the thick of it.A few of our financial members of the Staff, being seized with a fit of generosity rushed down to the boozer & secured a few bottles of champagne to help drown their sorrows & give them courage for the promenade.Price & a few more of this issue are now sitting in the sun feeling very contented with the present state of affairs & scraping the mud off their boots.
