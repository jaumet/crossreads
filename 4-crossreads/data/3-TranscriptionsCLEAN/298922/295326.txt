The diary is a record of his experiences of war but also a means of communication with his mother and family and hence he sends home pages of the diary at different times. During the year he becomes ill and is sent to hospital in Cairo . Later in the year he obtains leave to go to England to see his English wife, whom his family have not met. He travels by boat to Marseilles and then by train through Italy and France, finally reaching England towards the end of October. He describes his time in England, attending the theatre many times in London and finally, with his wife, Dolly, who is going to work with the Red Cross in Cairo, he returns to Egypt. ]
