We are very cramped for room in the Fantome - Where they find room for 109 of us I don't know yet - We were off Ballina & then Tweed Heads, driving North as hard as we could - We don't want to miss anything at Rabaul & therefore we are doing our best to get up - The sea was smooth & the weather glorious. So  far I much prefer this boat to the Upolu - all round - There is discipline & an ordered life - The officers are all right - We have 6 who can play Bridge -
The morning is work - The aftn & eveg have certain duties to be seen to but there is leisure & talk - With this war on I shouldn't care to settle down to ordinary civilian life - You are in the game & doing your little stunt with the best of the crowd - Stir up all the young men between 19 & 35 to enlist is the game for all of us & also for us senior men to take on whatever job offers - afloat or ashore - I'm making my S.B.A. get out the stretchers & our haversack & having everything put in order for instant service - He's slowly grasping that I'm boss, with a very strong will & with a certain power of vocal expression - He's mostly Ass -
