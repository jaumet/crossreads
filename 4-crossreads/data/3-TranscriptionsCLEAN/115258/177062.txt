  
 has made a pretty good job of them. Hit up for two quid in my pay book, which is the cost price of the fangs - the Govt give the work bucksheech. This winning the war in hospital is rather an expensive thing. You have to help the bally thing along by at least buying a paper, dont you know! and the beastly paper, 'the Gypo Mail' is 4d a spasm here and you and you only get two pages at that! s'awful! They must be making a fortune out of our patriotism! There is a big parcel mail in here so I'm looking forward to getting those two parcels Mother s  sent with the cake in one. It will go well with afternoon tea here. There is absolutely no news - so I'll knock off. Love to Father and Mother and F.H. Hales Wilson. 
 Your loving brother
