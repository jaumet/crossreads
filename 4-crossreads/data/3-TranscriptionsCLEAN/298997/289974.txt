  
 Am sending this by a man who is going back to Blighty - the Conducting N.C.O.  Will send others when I can.  Keep them  H. 
 Dec. 9 '17  [1917] Up to the last minute almost, I was doubtful as to getting on the draft.  It is only ten days since I left hospital and only last Monday that the Doctor let me go back on duty; but Sergeant Miller helped me through.  The idea of being amongst the last of our batch of reinforcements to go over I don't like. There is one man of our crowd who is trying to avoid the draft - Peters.  He has already avoided three, owing to dental troubles; and thought he broke his false teeth by falling in the hut.  The others who are here are all eager: but Williams who went away with me on special leave has not turned up yet --- two days overdue. 
 We fell in, all correct, at 6.30, and didn't get away till 11.  A crowded train, with numbers of men returning to the front, and very disgruntled at it.  Reached Southampton in the afternoon, and had to wait about till 8 o'clock, the position being relieved by a few light refreshments.  It was at Southampton that a Conducting N.C.O. in charge of our draft about a month back, lost himself.  He sneaked away up town, got drunk & forgot the draft, which went over & reported without him.  The poor chap had come over on 6 months duty in depots; but they sent him back for this episode; & he was killed almost a soon as he arrived. 
 Most of us new men are curious, excited & eager; the old hands are a bit morose over returning.  In the big sheds
