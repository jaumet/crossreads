Am afraid our boys are having a hard time in France & we should not grouse here. It is HATS OFF to the Infantry after this War. This climate makes a man very lazy & livery a big long tiring night march, SHELLS, etc. then a day or two in Bivouac. As I used to say in the old days - "Keep a bit up your sleeve for a Bush Fire". A man never knows when he may be turned out at any hour - hence we visit other Units very little. Just heard from Lance that Charlie was back in England slightly wounded in face but nothing serious.
