Dear Mr. Layton -Could you give Mrs. Brown a little immediate assistance. She is entirely without funds until she can draw her husband's pay on the 16t inst. He went enlisted yesterday into camp yesterday & she has two little children with her. It is a case of real necessity & I hope you will be able to help.
Yours faithfullyB. Booth.
