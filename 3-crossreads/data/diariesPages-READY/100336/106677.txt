be seen for miles The country is just broken here there by small rocky hills.
We had great difficulty in getting drinking water because the sentries would not let us out at the different stations. However we did get out at one station we got in conversation with a Russian civilian who spoke English. He told us we were going to the Angora , chief town of vilayet pop.40000 celebrated for mohair where there were other English prisoners
We arrived at Angora at 11 pm after a short time a strong guard of Turkish soldiers came down to the station to march us away. We were marched about 3 miles to a large buildings on a hill. This proves to be the American Agricultural College. During this short march we were badly treated being pushed knocked with the butts of rifles. We got to the building at midnight were put into 2 small rooms. There were a few spare mattresses but not half enough to go round.
On the morning we found that the crew of Submarine E 7 had arrived a few days before also a few soldiers from different regiments recently captured at the Dardanelles.
