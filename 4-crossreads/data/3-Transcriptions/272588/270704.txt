<p>Friday 10 May<br/>A couple of days ago a curious incident happened in the air on this front.  Owing to a Frenchman being out of his area, &amp; not returning a Britisher's signal, he was shot down by the Englisher &amp; killed.  Another Frenchman was brought down with a hole in his petrol tank.  Both Frenchmen were good fliers. The Funeral of the Frenchman took place to-day from here, attended by Australian &amp; French officers &amp; men.<br/>Quiet to-day. "B" beat "A" Section at cricket.</p>
<p>Saturday 11 May<br/>Glorious day to-day &amp; we have been doing nothing but loaf round camp, playing cricket &amp; football.  Rumour hath it that we go to the line again to-morrow, on the Strazeele front, right of where we have just been relieved.</p>
