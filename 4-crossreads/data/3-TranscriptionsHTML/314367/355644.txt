<p>Its about 9 am &amp; we are off &ndash; out to sea &ndash; There is some talk of Germans &amp; a G-ship outside &ndash; "Give peace in our time" says Mr Bumpus with a solemn wink at me &ndash; Well &ndash; we're off out God knows where &ndash; but this ship's company is as fit as fiddles &amp; our guns carry ? 7000 yards &ndash; Out we went &amp; I saw the most wonderful masterpiece of seascape I have ever seen &ndash; There are no end to the reefs &amp; islands but this particular vista was a vista that ran between two islands &ndash; palm fringed &ndash; The Fantome, the deep blue sea with its coral bottom &ndash; then green of the greenest water &amp; white foam &ndash; then the islands &amp; reefs &amp; foam &amp; beyond more white strung breakers, then the deep blue again of the Pacific &amp; then main land with fine huge mountains right in the back ground &ndash; The day was a superb one &amp; the play of light &amp; color over this vast panorama added to its superb beauty &ndash;<strike>to be seen</strike></p>
