the rear of the trenches over the sea. The fleet lying there peacefully at anchor. The 6th Battalion, having given us enough insight into their mode of warfare, moved out to the rest they so well deserve. I soon got busy with Adjutant's work. Brig General Walker and Colonel Forsyth were callers. Several boots sticking out of our hillside here attached to dead men's feet. Our chaps boots are getting worn so some of the dags have been seen to swop with a corpse! Unfortunately in pulling the boot off they often get the foot as well. Bed 21.00 ? we reckon time like French.
