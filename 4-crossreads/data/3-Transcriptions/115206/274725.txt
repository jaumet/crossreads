<p>June 1918<br/>Tuesday 4</p>
<p>Battery W.Lines.  near Pont Noyelles<br/>Weather glorious. Mother's birthday today. I wonder  how my dearest friend is. Went along to see John during the day.<br/>About 9.30 am, we received a surprise, in the form of an<br/>an aeroplane of the fighting type armed with three<br/>machine guns (named Sopworth Dolphin, flown <br/>by a young Indian Prince Lt Welinkar .Twas was a dandy<br/>little machine. Our major entertained the pilot during the <br/>day and as the machine was not repaired by sunset the<br/>pilot does not leave until the<br/>morning.</p>
