but I can't.
If it weren't for two or three pals I would die of sheer boredom.  Tell me all about the garden.  The gardens here aren't up to much, flowers are all old fashioned & very small.  Lots of common roses & iris & guelder roses & pinks &c.  Even the big Chateaux are disappointing in that respect.  They are imposing but seldom look very comfortable or homey, very stiff & formal mostly.  Its a quaint old country all right but the roads are gorgeous.  Now I must flee, so long,
Yours as everJames
