things. Pack of cards, cigarettes, tobacco towel & face cloth, sweets, plum pudding, matches writing paper & pencil, and in nearly all cases a very nice letter from the person who presented it. If only the people in Australia could have seen the boys when they were opening their parcels, I'm sure it would have made their hearts good glad. Golly! They were just like little children, and as each new article came to light, each man wanted all the others to stop unpacking their own billy, to come and look at what he had. Myself I was very lucky I have the parcel Mother sent me, one from Una, and also the two from the Comforts Fund. The letters are coming pretty regularly too; I don't know if you are receiving mine or not though I have sent several little souvenirs too. Enclosed with this are some more photos, which I have taken. A short description is written on the backs. Would you get a small Album or book and keep them for me, as I wouldn't have them lost for anything. Will be sending the negatives home later on, & anyone who cares may have the loan of them. The menu we had at Shoubra Hospital Xmas Dinner is also enclosed. I would like that kept.
