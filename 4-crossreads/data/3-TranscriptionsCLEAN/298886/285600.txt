the night to Katia (or QATIA.)
Arriving there about 5.AM. we have been in support of the other two regiments and have remained saddled up and ready to reinforce them at a moments notice.
Had a good and well earned rest under the "Shade of the sheltering palms". Five times we were prepared to bolt out and scatter on account of Enemy aeroplanes Three of them kept hovering about from one point to another. One hears the order" Hostile Aircraft, stand to your horses"! Nuf sed! you stand to your horses fully armed and prepare to scatter so as to lessen the possibility of injuries in case the plane does drop bombs. And let me state they are "some" bombs the noise of them coming down through space has a terrible moral effect The actual explosion and scattering of fragments is nothing compared to that terrific & terrifying roar through the air which the bomb makes in its descent. One of the planes dropped a message at Romani warning us (in French) to plainly mark our hospitals more plainly and have them distinct from the rest of the Camp. Are they contemplating another bomb dropping expedition?
