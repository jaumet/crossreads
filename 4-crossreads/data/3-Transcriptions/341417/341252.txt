<p>[Message side of the postcard on the previous page]<br/>My Dear Dr. &amp; Mrs Dunlop</p>
<p>Only 2 hours ago I rec'd your usually kind letter. This only a "Whiz-Bang" (The term was originally used to describe the shell of a high velocity field gun) to say, "All's Well and to give you a sample of the work of a French, Oliver Godfrey, I happened to meet once!  It was 2 months before I could get to him again. The horse I am riding was brought from Sydney in 1914 by my late Colonel &amp; its main value consists, after 2&frac12; years service, in being an old friend. It was really for the remembrance of my old nag that I faced the camera. Will write to you, more fully later on.</p>
<p>Best of Wishes Clem</p>
