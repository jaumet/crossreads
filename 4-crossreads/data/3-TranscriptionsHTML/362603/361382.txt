<p>3.  he comes back.  Yes indeed, we had a lovely time with Gran   &amp;   Auntie   &amp;   Marie.  When we walked into their nice Home it was just like Fairyland.  Everything was lovely, Marie sees to that.  Auntie is cook   &amp;   bottle washer &amp; Gran. is Auntie's off-sider.  Marie looks to the rest.  They had a woman doing the work but She took ill   &amp;   auntie was unable to get anyone else.  Anyway they are better pleased I think because with a stranger in the House a place is not Your own.  Their Yard Boy does all the messages   &amp;   dirty work, so they are spared the outdoor work.  My word that Rose of Mrs Doyles is a beauty isn't it.  Fancy it flowering so soon.<br/>I suppose You went to Georgie's orchestra's Concert.  It must have been some Show.  Do you go to the Dandies   &amp;   the Pictures now the Summer is on?  Aunty Fanny still living in the same House?  The Girl Percy married must be mad to take Him on.  I do not mean because of the Kiddies only, but He is more Brute than Man.  I could always picture that fellow as a wife beater,   &amp;   such a child too, only 17.<br/>I do not think there are many fleas here.  I remember one being on me when I was at Aunties.  Marie said well You must have brought Him here, because we have none.  Well, Mum dear, I have to write to Dad</p>
