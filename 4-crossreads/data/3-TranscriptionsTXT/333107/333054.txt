Wed June 26th  -  The Day
This is the 3rd Anniversary of the wonderful 26th. It is a glorious day, just such a one as it was in 1915. I hopped out of my blankets bright and early this morning, feeling almost well again. The Day must have cured me. Went down to Y.M., but there was nothing doing.
Got word to proceed into Weymouth and see Eye-Specialist at Red Barracks. He was a civilian and very nice old chap he was too. It was quite a treat to be spoken to like a man, instead of getting your head snapped off, as our M.O.'s do. He said my eyesight was not bad, but that I ought to wear glasses. He gave me a prescription and said that they would let me know when the "specs" were ready.
After leaving Red Barracks I took a stroll along the Prom and arrived back in Camp just too late for dinner.
I wonder if M.S. is thinking of me today. Why of course she is. I wrote a good long Letter. No 27,
After Tea I managed to get back to Town where I had a Feed of Chips, Fish was "off". As I was crossing the Bridge on my way back to Camp I passed a very prepossessing damsel who gave me the "Glad eye". I was about to respond - but checked myself. Well, I've been good so far, I must keep it up now.
And I turned into my Blankets about 10 feeling very lonely and longing for a pair of dimpled arms around my neck again.
