7 MondayDoing stretcher drill all the morning & went about a half a mile away under some trees & had some bandaging & a bit of a lecture.  Haymaking is in full swing here now on most of the farms about, owing to the shortage of men women are employed by the farmers, & are doing practically any description of farm labouring.
8 TuesdayWent on a practical course of stretcher drill , loading & unloading wounded men & attending to same.  We had some bandaging in the afternoon in the shade of some trees.  The days here are very warm now.  Went out for a walk in the evening getting back about 11 pm.
9 WednesdayRather foggy until about 8 am.  It has been very cold this last couple of mornings.  It is rumoured we are to leave for France on Friday. Rather a hot day.  Went for a very long route march all the morning, but we had quite an enjoyable march.  Handed in our second issue of clothing, only taking just things really necessary to proceed to France.  We are not certain as to when we are going.  The above rumor is true.
