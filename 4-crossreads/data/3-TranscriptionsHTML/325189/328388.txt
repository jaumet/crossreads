<p>The battleships started the show &amp; we proceeded to disembark.  The Turks constantly fired shrapnel.  A sailor &amp; soldiers were hit on the boat before we left.</p>

<p>The fort kept dropping shells all around us.  A pinnance towed 4 boatloads of my lot nearly to the shore &amp; then we had to row.  One boat struck &amp; sunk, men rescued.  When we touched bottom we sprung overboard into water waist high &amp; dashed up the beach into a gully for cover.  We piled our packs in a wall round a wounded men &amp; waited while the 3rd brigade drove</p>
