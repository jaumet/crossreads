Inspected the personnel of the Transport Section and found them below standard. Told Edwards he was for a company and put Thewlis on in his place. Had a talk to Harricks about "C" Coy. and then did some correcting of the Battn. history. The whole of the afternoon put in at reading and writing. The comedy of the duckhouse still continues and tonight Gorman, a g.s. wagon and the pioneers are to figure in its reconstruction. There is some dissatisfaction regarding the present running of the mess and tomorrow night we hold a mess meeting to discuss it. The Keithlet brought the usual mass of papers a little earlier.
