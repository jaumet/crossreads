<p>April, 1915<br/>Thursday 1<br/>Went via Cairo route March to Barrage on Nile &amp; bivouac for the night, wrote Laura &amp; Mrs Ferrar this morning &ndash; The Gardens here are the prettiest I have seen since leaving Australia. There is also a Museum, showing plans of all the Dams, Locks &amp; Weirs.<br/>At night there is a continual roar of Rushing water &amp; the mosquitoes were very bad &ndash; The men camped among the trees, quite a treat after the Desert.<br/>Every tree is covered with Bougainvillia or Roses, a most artistic spot.<br/>We swam all the horses across the Nile on an endless rope, it took about 20 minutes for Squadron 164</p>
