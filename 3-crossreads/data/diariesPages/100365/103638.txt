We are still passing through the most delightful country, although we can see more of the Ravages of War, by the number of destitute people Refugees of every descriptionWe passed through several Forrests, which were very beautiful the long white road winding in out of the dark green foliage massive tall trees on either sideAll the trees schrubs are covered with vines clingers I don't think I have ever seen anything to come up to it.We rested for the night at a place called Frettin which is a rather large kind of village off the main Road had tea at a Farm.In the evening I went into the Millers place had a pleasant social evening until about half past 10 when we set sail for our camp which was about 1 mile awaySomehow or other we lost the way it ended in us walking for about 2 hours finally striking the Camp at 1 am next morning.The weather was very cold you bet it made us sit up.However alls well that ends well so heres for the morning Reveille at 5 am about 20 miles to travel before dinner.Fighting very fierce can hear guns all night
