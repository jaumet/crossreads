  
 [13th April contd] returned safely  Wrote to home etc in Coffee stall in the "evacuated" area Houplines.  Was just hopping into bed when word came that I was to proceed to Houplines again with the night working party & get the bricks.  We drove down as far as it was safe to go in with Waggons.  Then each wagon was to dash along the road on its own - with ten minutes interval.  Arriving at the post we loaded very fast & got away again smoothly as Fritz sprays machine guns on the post occasionally.  However things passed O.K. & we proceeded to Steenwerck where the building a huge Dressing Station was in progress.  We eventually got back to billets at 3.30 am & had breakfast then bed.  Houplines by the way is in Belgium. 
 Saturday 14th [April] Our slumber was rudely awakened at about 8.30 by the whizzing of shrapnel & perhaps nose caps and as the roof was only Ruberoid I thought it best to get up & put my tin helmet on.  On investigating I found that a Fritzs aeroplane was about 100 ft above us & soldiers in streets had a machine gun (Lewis) & rifles playing on him but without effect.  Aircraft shrapnel was going dangerously low too.  He got away.   Afternoon    Visited Divisional Baths & had a 'bon' bath.
