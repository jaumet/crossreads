  
 362 shortly - They had me on the operating table again last night and after examining the eye very carefully  decided it wouldn't be safe to operate, any how the doctor said the cataract wan't ready to be removed - I wish they'd take the eye right out and be done with it - it gets jolly painful at times and one of the doctors told me it would probably have to come out in the end - I'll pull the wretched thing out myself one of these days -
