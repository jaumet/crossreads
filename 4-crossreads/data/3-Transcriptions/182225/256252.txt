<p>MAY&nbsp;&nbsp; SUNDAY 14&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Bitterly cold westerly gales with rain squalls and a very lumpy sea&nbsp; A lot of the fellows very seasick in morning but most brightened up towards evening. There was to be a church parade in morning but it was cancelled on account of the seasickness</p>
<p>We all lay on the promenade deck all day like a litter of pups to keep warm. I never thought that I would be only too glad to curl up with every and anybody and sleep; but I was today. I was not homesick but I did want to be at Lisheen for a few hours. Saw the last of Australia for some time</p>
