<p>Tuesday 31 July 1917.</p>
<p>With the camels again this morning. Went on leave to Cairo last night and going again tonight. A wonderful sight and places to be seen &quot;as old as the hills&quot;.</p>
<p>Saw old castle where slaves were sold in early days. This place now used for military purposes. The staging of the gallows still remains &amp; old blood stains are still to be seen.</p>
