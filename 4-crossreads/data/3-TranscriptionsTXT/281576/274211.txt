 Mon. May 7.  Last night we had quite settled down to Bunk when Sgt Thomson came &amp; sung out the names of 100  Bearers to be ready to move off at a moments notice &amp; my name was among 'em.  It appears that the casualties among stretcher Bearers is very high &amp; we have to go out to relieve them.  After Tea we had a run through our Programme for tomorrow night at the Reinf Camp.
