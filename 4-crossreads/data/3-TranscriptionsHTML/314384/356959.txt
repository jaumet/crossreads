<p>of the Corduroy road, there is no necessity to worry, 'tis only a Battalion relieving or as we term it "changing over".<br/>6. Phew, crash, followed by a roar in the rear of <strike>the outside</strike> exterior of our dugout, causes one of the sleepers to awaken, and Snowie to feel his head. The awakened one's first query is "Whats up". Snowie replies to the effect that one has burst very close to the Home and in all probability the "lines" have <strike>been broken</strike> gone. Buzz Buzz Buzzz goes the phone, and on receiving no answer the "call" is repeated. No answer again. Snowie turns to the awakened one, and remarks, "Come on Wattie lines gone." Outside 'tis raining heavily, not a very nice place to walk at all. We are ready to leave, armed with our pliers, torch, &amp; insulating    <strike>wire</strike>  tape we depart. Outside our dugout door we pick up our wires and after floundering along for a few yards discover the break. Having at last repaired the line we return Home, where after a "test" with satisfactory results, Wattie retires to continue his disturbed slumber.</p>
