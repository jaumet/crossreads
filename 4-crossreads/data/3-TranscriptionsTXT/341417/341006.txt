and we are still going strong.
Returning Franks letter it is "bonzer".
I am sending two Turkish Notes (money) home in this letter that I got off a prisoner at Rafa.
I have carried them for a good while but they are getting worn out so I am chancing it and sending them to you, hope you get them.
They are not very valuable in Turkish money but to show how short of money they are; the notes are worth in Turkish money, the larger one about a shilling and three half-pence, and the smaller one about two-pence half-penny, but I know you will value them.
Tell me if you get the snaps and letter of Frank's that I send in this letter also the Turkish notes.
