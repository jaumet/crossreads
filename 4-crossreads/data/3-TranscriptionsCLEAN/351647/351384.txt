 Dear Mrs. Jack, 
 Fancy its one year today since we left Sydney in the old Persic, it doesn't seem that in some ways, time goes very quickly & yet in some ways the life there & indeed all that has happened since seems very far away.  I wish this month & next & January would go quickly as just now things are particularly trying, it is that cold that I don't know really how I am going to keep alive much less work.  One has no idea of it in our parts & then there we have warm rooms & fires & hot food & a good bed &c., &c.  And here well thank heaven my dug out is a pretty warm one & I have a clerical job.  I have to get out a bit & it nearly kills me. 
 I'm getting chilblains on my feet & on my ears & I can hardly write & taken all round
