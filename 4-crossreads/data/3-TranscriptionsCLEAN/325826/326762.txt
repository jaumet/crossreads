  
 5.  still I dare not actually count on it & would not have you do so until things are more definite.  There are so many things that might happen to upset it after all that I am not going to let myself get excited about seeing you again till I am really on the boat, that is not more than I can help. And now I find I must close this to be quite sure of the mail.  Very much love as always, Your loving daughter Olive. P.S.  The photos of Wal are the best I could print off am sorry I did not manage to take better ones.  I have enclosed them in Jobber's letter because there is more room.    O.L.O.
