<p>We're all much pleased with this new shooter &ndash; its lighter than the rifle and a 'bloque' can afford to swank a bit with one such stuck over his tummy. &ndash; I heard from Chas. a couple of weeks back. He was then having a good time, plenty to eat, not too much work, and seemed cheeky again &ndash; as witness the fact that he'd had a go for a 3 mile cross country with a lump of iron sticking under his skin. Told me it was only a scratch &ndash; splinter affair - &amp; had healed up OK.</p>
<p>Well I'll leave you at this page. A pile of long letters went on the Mongolia, so perhaps I'd better not test luck again. Remember me to any of the Maronbraites you meet &ndash; I don't write, except home letters, as if I write to one must write to a hundred &amp; I need the d.s for tucker. Love to Home - &amp; yourself &amp; tons of <u>Luck RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE </u> from your brother Harry.</p>
