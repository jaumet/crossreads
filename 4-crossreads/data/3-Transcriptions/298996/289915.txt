<p>Last night we were to go sapping but the order was cancelled. [indecipherable] was carried out this morning. while we were digging the Snipers gave us a bullet or so now &amp; again. Which made the boys duck. We went for a swim this afternoon the beach was literally full of undressed soldiers. The Turks sent a few shells &amp; sharapnel down amongst same which killed some also wounded a good many.</p>
