I spent the best Holiday of my life, &amp; the weather then &amp; now is perfect.  The whole country is more wonderful to the view than anyone unacquainted with England could conceive, &amp; it defies anyone, however great, to give a description.</p>
<p>I have nothing to do in this camp &amp; I fill in the time as pleasantly as possible.  Yesterday, Sunday, I walked to Salisbury, about 10 miles.  It was very hot but the avenues of massive beach trees made walking a treat, &amp; I covered the distance in 2&frac12; hours.  I left Mr Edmond's house at 9.30 &amp; got Home safely without a pass; I know how to dodge the "Jacks" easily enough.  Well, I must get ready for tea now &amp; there is no news to give you at all.  Billy &amp; I are going the village after tea for a walk &amp; then back to the Pictures.</p>
<p>Best Love to you all Harry</p>
