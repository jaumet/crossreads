Friday 29 MarchGood Friday.  Wet. Last night Fritz shelled about here fairly heavily catching a battery.  We had two trips out & much gas was in evidence.
Saturday 30 MarchWet & miserable to-day but still very quiet on the front.  A German airman very daringly came very low over our lines & escaped scot free. News from the Somme still disconcerting & the advance is in one place 25 miles deep & in another 15 miles from Amiens.
