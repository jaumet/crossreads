<p>18.2.1917<br/>My dear Father,</p>
<p>I sent you a cable this morning with Birthday wishes. Should have sent it 2 days ago to reach you on time but it was not for want of thinking of it. No opportunity to get it through till today.</p>
<p>This is not a letter but mail closes today so am just letting you know we are still OK - Incoming</p>
