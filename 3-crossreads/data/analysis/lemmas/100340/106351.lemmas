 I have met Tom Welch P. Davi sever time now miss see C. Lewington last night by about ten minut . I was in that stunt the other day in which we captur that villag but was lucki enough again to come out with a whole skin . We were kept work pretti hard for about 24 hour . I sent you a card about a fortnight ago for your birthday . I could not get a decent one , in fact the one I sent I found in one of the desert villag so it will be a souveni as well . Am glad to hear Aunt Flo is look so well I have n't heard from her now for over a month . Do not know whether you will understand this scribbl but I am write in a dugout hard big enough to sit up in . We are have real summer
