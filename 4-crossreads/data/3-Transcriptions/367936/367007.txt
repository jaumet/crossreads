<p>Tuesday 11 July 1916<br/>Discovered Museam on my own.  Saw a lot of old Egyptian stuff &amp; mummies but as none of them were branded, I did not think much of them.<br/>Met Nelson in town, came home in Garry.<br/>Sent book of Alex home.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12 July 1916<br/>Walked round sea wall talking to kids and taking photographs.  Had a look round old Egyptian fort at Anfouchy.</p>
