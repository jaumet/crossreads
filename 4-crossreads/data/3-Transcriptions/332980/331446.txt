<p>&amp; at 4 Pm I dressed &amp; had my hot Dinner &amp; caught the Staff Train into St Omer &amp; on to the French Pictures &amp; spent an enjoyable Evening, The Hall was crowded with Soldiers &amp; Civilians,   after a couple of Drinks I bought the Daily Paper &amp; off back to Camp &amp; once more into Bunk, Monday I was on a Stand by job but did not leave the Depot,.</p>
<p>Tuesday 17th.<br/>I signed on for a run to Hazebruick to work for a Construction Coy leaving the Depot at 6 am arriving there at 6.45 am, &amp; what a shock I got, as it was last March when I was there last &amp; it was a very busy place &amp; the  Town full of Civilians &amp; this time it was deserted with very little Traffic about, The Station has had a very rough handling &amp; knocked about, the verandah's &amp; glass roofs are lying strewn about everywhere, the Houses all close to the station have been badly shattered, the Tile Roofs are in an awful state, the shell holes &amp; Bomb</p>
