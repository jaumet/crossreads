<p>and the famous Warwick Vase, next came under our view after which, again we took to the car to speed through pretty old world villages to the ruins of Kenilworth Castle.&nbsp; Here my American friends insisted on hiring a guide, and told him that we were in a hurry; this aroused him to a frenzy.&nbsp; The time usually taken by him is about twenty minutes, he got us through in ten minutes, breathless and bewildered, no, I do not admire the American method of &quot;doing&quot; a place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The trip home brought us back to Stratford in time to enjoy some punting, boating and canoe-ing on the river, to visit again a few of the museum places which had been closed on Sunday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A concert at the Inn; a good sleep, an early breakfast, and a quick train to town found me at 3 o&#39;clock keeping an appointment with a bookbinding firm, and so ended the holiday.&nbsp; Since then I&#39;ve worked in two days holiday with our relatives in Plymouth, saying a long good-bye.</p>
