<p>Tuesday 25 February 1919<br/>Met Uncle Bill at 10.15 am &amp; went with him to his tailors &amp; got measured for a grey suit. Have to try on tomorrow. Then did some shopping &amp; then to the Council Chambers &amp; heard a council meeting. Had lunch there &amp; had a look at the museum. It was great. After this I had a look at St. Giles Church &amp; gee it is great as good as any I've seen. Then went out to Comely Bank again. Auntie was much better &amp; was up. Had tea &amp; then uncle &amp; I went to some movies &amp; then back home for supper. Got a big parcel of greens to take back to London for Marie.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26 February 1919<br/>Went to Lambert's &amp; tried the suit on. It looks very well indeed. Then over to the Caledonian Station &amp; got the train to Glasgow. Wandered around till 1.45 pm (an hour) had lunch &amp; then met Harry. She had to go back to the kids so I went out to see Alice Vernon. She is a very homely sort of person &amp; persists in making one keep eating. The two boys came home &amp; I showed them how to play marbles etc &amp; gave them a general rough vocabulary. Gave Arthur one of my wristlet watches &amp; 2/- to Ernie. Harry then came along &amp; she &amp; Alice took me to along to meet Ernest. He was a door Keeper at Clara Butt's concert. Then took Harry &amp; Alice to dinner at the Grosvenor &amp; then caught the train to London</p>
