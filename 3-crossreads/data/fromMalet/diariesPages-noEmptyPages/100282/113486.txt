inary line of men which consisted of a number of bags lying on the ground with a piece of white paper for the bayonet to be used on, after passing this they came to an old trench which they lined here they got the order to fire 5 rounds the Lewis Guns had to open also on big white targets abut 300 yds distant, they had a minute to get rid of this, then they had to charge another line, man an old parapet, here they had to fire as many rounds as they could get off in 2 minutes, didn't the Lewis's spit them out, though Goggins Earnshaws guns jammed a little but they made up for it at the second range, the object was to get as many hits as possible points were also given for fire control, steadiness, turnout, etc, I don't know how any of the platoons got on, but I think the Coy. done alright
Hockey was all the go this afternoon again, we had a pretty good scratch match going the fun was fast furious for an hour or so.
