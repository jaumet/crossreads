Feb 22 1918Left Alexandria for Taranto escorted by a British destroyer Bassilan. The Jap escort cancelled. It appears the Light Cruiser Liverpool armed speed 30 knots was leaving the same day with the Duke of Connought & staff aboard after being at Egypt decorating the soldiers with medals. She had about 40 guns of all calabre. Well the 2 Jap destroyers were taken from us & sent to convey the Cruiser. The English officers on board our ship were very bitter considering we were full of troops & having sent over with a small destroyer instead 0.8. with all due respects to this destroyer.We zig zag day & night as the moon was full. The 2nd & 3rd day out it blew a heavy gale of wind. We had to ease down as the destroyer was sometimes completely under water our speed reduced to 9 knots. The 3rd night out whilst on the bridge on watch at 9pm we shipped some sea forehead & stove in all the ventilators on the forecastle head.  So eased down to 5 knots so as to allowed the sailors to repair the damage & shift the wreckage. It took 2 hours. The destroyer was awful. Sea all over her. rouling & pitching. In fact they must have been exceptionally good sailors to stand it. So we eased down again so as to give him a chance.
