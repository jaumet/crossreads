<p>Concerning Carlyle<br/>The furrowed, rough hewn, rugged face;<br/>The lank, ungainly, shrunken form;<br/>The runner weired of his race;<br/>The vessel battered by the storm.</p>
<p>Tuesday 21st Nov.<br/>Marched out at 8 A.M. for the A.D.S. &amp; had a very stiff march altho' only about 4 or 5 miles.  The mud was very stiff &amp; tenacious &amp; made walking very difficult.  We were relieving the Guards division &amp; were struck by their particularly fine physique.  The A.D.S. was on a new sector, the "Le Transloy" &amp; closer to the line than the last &amp; was also run by the 14th, the other Ambulances being attached to us.  Huts newly built &amp; hidden by branches were in use, situated in a valley &amp; altogether a very comfortable place, that is if the enemy leaves us alone.  Spent the day in fixing things up &amp; went on night duty at 8.30 for 12 hours.  Ground everywhere pitted with shell holes, so close as to intersect.</p>
<p>Thursday 23rd Nov.<br/>On night duty doing 12 hour shifts.  Not much doing as a rule in the way of patients but plenty of noise from the guns, two 6" naval guns being within a 100 yds of us.  The Huns send a few over occasionally but so far none very close.  Roads in a terrible condition &amp; travelling very hard on the patients.  Have not seen much of the surroundings owing to sleeping all day.</p>
