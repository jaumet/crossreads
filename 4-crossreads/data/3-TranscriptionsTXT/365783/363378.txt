 back from seeing General Williams.   I have not yet had a letter since our arrival at Alexandria &ndash; I have been a bit worried at not getting any news but suppose it must be through some mistake &ndash; most of the other officers have had letters galore.  Fred is keeping in good form &amp; seems quite happy &amp; contented.  I spoke to him about whether he wanted to change over to a Regiment but he seems quite satisfied. Good bye dearest old woman &amp; God bless you and the children.   Spend as much money as ever you like &ndash; I dont want you to go short of anything &ndash; take plenty of motor drives &amp; go to the theatres &amp; get decent seats (none of your 6d hangovers)   If you want more cash get it from Arch. Best love to all from Yr. loving husband Will
