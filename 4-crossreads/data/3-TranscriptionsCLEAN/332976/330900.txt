July 191722nd   I have got my teeth fixed up but only temporily, & returned to Corbie by train this afternoon.   A concert was held in the hospital last night & it was a great success.   The concert party was made up from the 8th Field Amb. are known as the "Night Birds."The whole company were out on a route march this morning & returned about 1.30 P.M. but I missed it, fortunately.23rd   Nos. 1 & 4 sections were out drilling this morning near the canal, & this afternoon we went down to the wharf & cleared up all stores & material & took it up stream about a mile & stacked it at the Lock.
