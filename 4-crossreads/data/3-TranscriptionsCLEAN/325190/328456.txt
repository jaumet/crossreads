it was there that the awful atrocity of cutting breasts off nuns who would not betray the Allies, took place.The Flemish lady referred to, was in Ypres during the German occupation of that town, & surprised us by remarking that they were not bad on the whole.

I think that three years has been sufficient to make them regard with a more kindly less critical eye, what at first must have horrified them
