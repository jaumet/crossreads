This objective secured, a second barrage will take place, the second wave of infantry will again move forward over the area controlled by this barrage. The third final barrage will take place about 9.30 am. It will isolate the third section of the Enemys lines our infantry will advance at 10 am. The barrage will be maintained for some time so that our position may be consolidated. Altogether we expect to advance 1,500 yards over a frontage of about 15 miles.
Our way lay through Ypres, which we reached at 3.30 pm. I secured several pictures of our forces camped in small dugouts excavated in the surrounding ramparts. We took the car through the Menin Gate as far as from where further transport is inadvisable; the Menin road beyond this point being enfiladed at uncertain intervals heavily shelled.
