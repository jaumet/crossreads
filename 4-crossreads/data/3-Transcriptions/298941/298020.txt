<p>Tuesday 23 April<br/>Yesterday Fritz started to shell the other end of the village with 5.9s, &amp; then after tea got in to the village proper &amp; hit some buildings. He shelled at about five minute intervals<br/>The result was that we had some civilian patients: one old woman with a broken leg, &amp; a young girl.<br/>The worst side of it, however,  was the evacuation</p>
