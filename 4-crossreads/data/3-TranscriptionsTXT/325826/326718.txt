More than once we could not help remarking then, & Rid & I have done since, how glad you would be to know we had been together at any rate so much.          It is an hour's tram ride out to the Pyramids from Cairo but it is through intensely interesting scenery & is not tiresome.  We were a little late in starting out for them because we went to the Bank & one or two other places we wanted to give Wal directions to, and you will think it was rather late for afternoon tea when I tell you it was after 7 o'clock when we sat down.  It did not spoil our dinner though so it was all right.  It was such a pity we couldn't have had Le too.  I had a very nice letter from him re-addressed from Alexandria & though it is not headed so, I gather he is down at Tel-el-Keber.  He is going to come up to Alex. to see me early in March if we cannot arrange anything before, I am sure I shall hug him when I see him wherever it is.We tried to arrange to go out with Wal the following day or Saturday but received a note next morning from him by his orderly to say that he would be close at it till Monday night & no chance of seeing him till Tuesday at the earliest, that is to-morrow.On Friday I had a most exhilarating day, my letters that I had asked to be re-addressed here came, and there were 19.  It was fine to have heard about you from Wal the day before, & then to have your letters the next day.  Thank you both so much for the lovely long separate letters you wrote, I had two from you Mother, I do so love getting them but I don't want you to weary your dear selves you have so little time & so many letters to write.
