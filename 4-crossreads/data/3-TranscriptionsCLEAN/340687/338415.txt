  
 April, 1917. Saturday 21 Was up early and tried to run her. In afternoon brought Savage over who kindly fixed her up by altering magnets & governor and I feel more confident now. Went down to water point for ration of tea and home to read paper till 10. News of Corpse transformation and big concentration on west front.
