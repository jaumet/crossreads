Saturday Feb 5th
dull cool day : a few showers : Revellie 6 am : two hours physical : breakfast : general inspection after breakfast : no drill : after dinner Arthur. Harry myself went into Cairo on a ramble. We got out at the shop after the station went looking for the famous mosque. After a walk round we got the right tram got out at the citadel. the tram trip was through very "low" quarters. On getting out of the tram we bargained with a guide to show us over three mosques for 1 piastre each : On entering each mosque we had to pay 1 dieaster for our shoes : (everyone before entering has to get the slippers on) The first one was the blue mosque the architecture very good the interior carvings etc being splendid. There were also tombs of one of the Sultans : his wifes mother. The next one was the famous SF RAFFAI mosque to get any idea of the interior one wants to imagine himself in fairyland : The walls are of slabs of alabaster marble with beautiful grainrings markings running through them. The roof was simply bewildering all beautiful domes painted beautiful colours amp with gold. the chandeliers were of silver about 10 ft across: the wood work (doors etc)
