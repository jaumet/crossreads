 Revielle at 5.30 The first regt started fording at 7.30 this morning the means of crossing the Nile were very crude, two platforms were fixed on either bank then two large trading skifs were brought alongside capable of holding 26 horses &amp; men each. One horse hopped overboard but was secured without any trouble. When the troops got over the other side they went to the far side of the island where the canal had to be ferried again. Then straight on to Pakara a distance of about 5 miles, we had to supply communication from both banks, then at 4 all the phones had to be run out to all units. Drew stores then three motors went down to the river to bring back the Sigs whose horses were brought back earlier in the day, we had a proper go for three miles &amp; mine was easiest the fastest. Bed at 9.45

Then Chas Cox &amp; I went to HQ, day is going to be very hot &amp; flies awful.  I had several runs either way, my two tyres came off again &amp; so did I, something will have to be done or there'll be a funeral The troop arrived home at 7 looking very dusty but happy after spending a most enjoyable day.  An open air concert is to be held in the Tewfik Palace which turns out splendid a Signoria Splastadia renders [indecipherable] beautifully, the talent is good &amp; better than most that perform in 1st class concerts in Melb.
