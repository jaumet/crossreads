shore was unable to see round more of the town because I was due back on board at 2pm. I was also unable to go into the native quarters, there being guards posted on all the main thoroughfares into the suburbs to prevent us from going into them.
I would have liked to go into the suburbs, because I believe it to be the prettiest place of Colombo, also I should think it would be a better place to see native life than in the city.
Before I left for the ship, I purchased a couple of native ornaments for a Souvinir. We left Harbour at 7pm and ran straight into rough windy weather, with a voyage of from 10 to 14 days to Freemantle W.A.
The lights of Colombo had vanished from sight before I turned in.
On the 31st of the month we were well out in the Indian Ocean and out of sight of land. The sea is smooth.
