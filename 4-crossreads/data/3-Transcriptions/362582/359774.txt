<p>to be very careful what I eat these times, anyhow I'm quite alright again &amp; feeling very fit. Am off just now for one hour's rest before luncheon. We are not quite so busy to-day, so take a little extra time off when slack. I was at a Picture Show &amp; out to dinner on Friday-night with a Captain Combes. He is a patient I nursed when first I came over. He is on the Staff at Details Duty Office, Cairo now &ndash; he was in Alexandria while I was there &amp; gave me a good time. When leaving I introduced him to another Sister, a friend of mine, &amp; I beleive it is a serious case with them, he is awfully in love with her &amp; I think she is too. So I'm doing a little match-making. He is a bit young for me, or I should be jealous, but am very pleased. Eric Baker called to see me on Saturday &amp; he looks grand in his uniform. He has grown a great height since I last saw him. Am meeting him to-morrow night. I must write to</p>
