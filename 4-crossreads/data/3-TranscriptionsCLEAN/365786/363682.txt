other than a fully trained nurse?  These are lots of English people resident there & these, both men & women were always busy helping & cheering our men.  It was summer while I was in Egypt & a great many of the English & French women had gone to cooler climates, but even so there were plenty still there & a good many Australians like myself whose family affairs took them there & now that the cool weather has set in, there the residents will all be back & once more visit & look after our men;  & so I do not think we need feel that we are wanted there.  But here there is much to do.  Red Cross work must be done - we must not slacken our efforts or our dear ones will feel the pinch on the other side.  Then there are the homes of our men soldier friends - perhaps they have left a Mother or a sister, a wife or children & surely we can visit & cheer these & thus do our bit.
