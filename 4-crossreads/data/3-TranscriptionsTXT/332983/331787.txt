 A Sgt and Corporal gone to Anzac this morning, got a commission, Sgt O'Rielly is the Sgt. Lieut Selmes stopping at wagon line sick. Today is not so windy. 3/9/1915 A fair amount of Artillery fire last night, although rather quiet this morning. No rumours of any move yet. We are simply waiting, God knows what for. German aeroplane over, dropped one bomb and then made off, time 6 A.M. On our left flank rather a fierce attack. Some very big shells exploding, they are coming from the Navy, as we can hear the boats shooting 4/9/1915 First shot over this morning 6.15. Just missed our wagon line by 50 yards, one single shot. Great stir up in our camp a rumour about that our horses with the exception of 6 teams and 2 water cart, and one riding, to go to Alexandria. A nice fine morning, no wind or dust, not hot or cold, just right. The attack the other night was from the Turkish side, it appears we were sapping towards their trenches, and they were doing the same towards ours. They got in first and blew our sap up. 9 men of the Manchesters were wounded. 5/9/1915
