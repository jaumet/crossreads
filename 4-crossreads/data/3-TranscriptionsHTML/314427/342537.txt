<p>I slept on deck where there was a little breeze.</p>
<p>I handed to the Educational officer 2 limericks, one short story, a joke. &ndash;  all original. The course today is about 5 degrees East of South. I am on boat picket this evening. We go on at 4 p.m. again at 8 p.m. and at 10 a.m. tomorrow. We examine the roll &amp; take up our stations, are inspected &amp; then go off. It is just a matter of form.</p>
<p>Saturday April 12.1919.   153<br/>Another hot day.  I slept on deck last night. It was very windy but nice &amp; cool. Between decks was like a oven last night &amp;  today. There was a Red Cross issue of cigarettes today.</p>
<p>We crossed the line today and the crew celebrated the occasion by rigging up a huge canvas bath, Sailors and soldiers joined in ducking all they could get near it,  a huge crowd watched the fun, until they turned the hose on them.</p>
<p>Today I wrote another short paper for the literary Competitions</p>
