<p>Thursday March 28<br/>Jacko bombed to day at daybreak. Gave us hell. Casualties coming in fairly heavy Transport cannot get along owing to only one road and that in bad condition owing to rain. Capt Sutton &amp; seven of us moving out to night to advanced dressing station. Bombed again just as we were saddling up 18 Taubes. Did a fair amount of damage. No Anti Air craft guns here so Jacko had it all his own way Moved out at 5.30 &amp; moved to main road towards Esault After going up road for about &frac14; mile we turned on to a Goat track. Several times we were compelled to dismount &amp; walk owing to the roughness of the Country</p>
