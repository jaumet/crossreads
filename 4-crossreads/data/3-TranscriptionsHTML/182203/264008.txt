In fact I should have been quite alright only for a wretched abscess I got under my R. arm, that, is alright, but more pleasure in store for me &ndash; have two other boils just near the old one &amp; shall have to have them opened in a couple of days. I'm put on Stout. Horrid stuff. Anyhow I'm feeling grand, so don't worry.<br/>Col.
