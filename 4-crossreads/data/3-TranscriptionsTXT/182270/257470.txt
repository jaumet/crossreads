 SATURDAY, JUNE 7, 1919. 
 Fine, with a misty scud in afternoon. 
 down at the Middle Bore again. The 
 whole pipe slipped &amp; we had to 
 get the winch to pull it up 
 again. Got it going but it broke 
 the rod. Let 100 acres of Wheelers 
 clearing to MacInnes at 5/- per acre. 
 Swapped creamy colt to 
 R. Welch for a bay mare.
