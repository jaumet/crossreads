<p>July 1915<br/>Monday 5th<br/>The Turks gave us a good reveille at 4am with about 50 shells.  Our guns opened up &amp; they knocked off.  One of our men was wounded.  Was on pick &amp; shovel work all day.  There was great activity in the bay.  Seem to be searching for the submarine which sank a French troopship yesterday.  The enemy started a big 11 inch going quite close to our lines but quite a number of their shells overreached &amp; fell into the sea.  Got a letter from mother in the mail tonight dated June 1st.</p>
<p>Tuesday 6th<br/>Was on a gun dragging fatigue in the morning.  Had nothing else to do all day, wrote a letter to mother.</p>
<p>Wednesday 7th<br/>Was mess orderly &amp; had an easy day.  Went down on to the beach at night drawing rations &amp; didn't have to stand to in the morning.</p>
