<p>The secret of our Empires glory<br/>   The women there are at home<br/>Greater than the wealth of a nation<br/>   God on our knees we invoke<br/>Support through great desolation<br/>   The women there are at home.</p>

<p>When you're crouching in a trench, or<br/>   out in No man's Land<br/>Or in a charge or gas attack, or in a<br/>   raid well planned,<br/>What makes you set your chin so firm<br/>   what makes your courage rise,<br/>You see beyond one smiling face, You<br/>   see your woman's eyes,<br/>Aye, while you strive, she toils &amp; hopes<br/>   and fights a harder fight<br/>She scans each day the fateful list<br/>   &amp; dreads each fateful night.<br/>Smile on our Empires women folk<br/>   smile on though hearts may ache,<br/>Keep smiling smiling smiling till at<br/>    Last the dawn doth break.</p>
