<p>I heard sad news on arrival at Codford, poor Frank Kingsley and a chap named Ted. O'Toole being killed on April 2nd at Mozelle, in France:</p>
<p>The weather brightened up considerably now, although snow fell in April. I have never seen trees shoot out so remarkably quick, as I did in England. It seemed more like a transformation scene in a pantomime.<br/>Big towns such as Bristol, Bath, Warminster, Bournemouth, were all within reach of Codford per motor, and in company with other men we spent a happy time together. One could scarcely believe his eyes, nature being decked out in such beautiful garb.</p>
<p>The trees looked just a picture, all nature was so green, so different to the parched up country in Australia in the summer. A very pretty little village, Bishop Fontill by name, was a veritable eyepicture, the beautiful estate of a wealth man, it was the visiting place of many soldiers.</p>
