1916 Thursday 6 Jan.
Got into Camp at the Warren Tempe about 3pm & was put in the 5/2 D A C. Was put in a tent with 10 others & we were on duty that day & night. Its not a bad camp there at all, & a very fair lot of fellows in it, & they weed out all the roughies as they can. Plenty of leave given at the camp. General leave for all, but unit on duty, from 4.30 to 10 every night & 12.30 Saturday, to 10pm Sunday & as its only 20 minutes from Sydney by train most fellows go in every night  I go out to Neutral Bay every night & stay there the week ends. Have seen a good few old school mates about camp
