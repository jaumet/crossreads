Sunday 5 August
Raining fairly heavily.  In addition to the usual paper run and the trips to Brigade & Divisional Hd. Q. I had another run to Hazebrouck this afternoon passing through Blaringhem Steenbecque & Morbecque on the way there & returning through Morbecque, Steenbecque, St. Venant, Boesingen, Aire & Wittel.  Had a look round Aire plus a first class tea.  In Morbecque I visited a few friends made during our stay there last year.Hazebrouck was shelled on August 1st with long range guns.
