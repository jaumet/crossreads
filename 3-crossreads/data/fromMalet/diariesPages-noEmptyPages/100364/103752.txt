through mountain passes, past Kulonch and down to Lutron at the foot of the rolling Judean Hills, thence through to Ramleh and away to Jaffa by the sea. 
In the far north rose the hills around Haifa, and southward past Gaza. I could easily trace all the familiar routes and villages, but they were not as clear as usual owing to the mist Icoming in from the Sea. We landed at the Hangars at 2 pm just in time to witness Major Williams reviewing his Squadron. This day ranks as one of the salient in my life, for I feel I have travelled, and seen the most fascinating and wondrous area of our globe. 
At evening I gave a lecture to 200 men, which was well received on Antarctica.
