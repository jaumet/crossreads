Rations have been cut down to the absolute minimum, and we are now eating horse.

 I have been in England about six weeks now, and am more reconciled to the life than when I last wrote.  My luck was certainly good, to return from such a good holiday in Paris, & come direct on a six months trip to England.  I don't think I told you about the Paris trip.  It was one of the best holidays I have had.  Arrived on Xmas Eve, and was given a free dinner to start with.  It was a real Xmas spread, Turkey, nuts, wine etc., and was the first of its kind since leaving home, therefore greatly appreciated.  That night I attended a dance at the leave Club, & received a small present as a souvenir.
