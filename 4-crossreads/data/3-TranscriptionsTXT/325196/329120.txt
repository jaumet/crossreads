19-2-16Sat 19thKerosene has run out here  & we cannot keep the lamp alight all night now & it was brought in from the well last night; & Smithers was on duty at a different post in the desert last night. This afternoon I went over to see the lads in B Troop. I went as guard to the transport with Sergt Doyle & Charlie Burke, We took them over some bread for a change.
20-2-16Sun 20thSome gift goods were distributed today (sent by Mrs Vernon) I was not lucky enough to get any, had nothing to do today, but am on duty on mounted patrol tonight; Sutherland the despatch rider says we are likely to have a scrap within a few days, but probably a little higher up the river
