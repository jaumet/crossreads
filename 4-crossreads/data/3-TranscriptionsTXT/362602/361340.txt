 big white grubs that the magpie likes.  We have just finished a bit more work &amp; I am writing on a kerosene tin that we got from the Q.M. [Quartermaster] Stores.  There are a lot of fellows up here that we know well but we are very busy men now &amp; spend all our time amongst our tent mates.  I am trying to get leave for 3 days next weekend.  Jack &amp; Roy are leaving on the 30th of this month so I will go out to their send-off on Saturday night &amp; go over to Ida's place on Sunday morning.  I will be home Sunday afternoon &amp; stay till Monday afternoon. 
 Well I think I have told you all the news this time.  I will write again soon &amp; tell you if I am able to do as I have said above about the leave. 
 Love to all From Harry 
 P.S.  This is Sunday morning &amp; it is glorious.  We will be having breakfast in a few minutes, so I will have to stop.  Our pay arrived but I don't think we are to draw any as our names were not put on the payroll at L'pool.  We all have plenty of money so it does not matter. 
 Well Au Revoir Harry
