The chaps got some lovely souvenirs as the Turks left all their things behind them even pulled off their boots to get through the sand quicker.I found a heap of nice clean folded white calico bags near a machine gun, think they were meant for sand bags anyhow one is doing good work as a kit bag for me.  I also got some cartridges and pouches etc which I thought would be good to bring home.The Turks seem a pretty ragged lot and all round the back of their firing line were empty bottles of wine and rum which shows what they fight on.I have not got the letter yet telling me of taking delivery of the car so supposed it is lost; hope the car is still going well, wonder if you have gone out to Nyngan yet.Stella sent me a parcel which I got the same time as Aunt Katie's one, it had fish & prunes in it and my word it was nice as we have only had bully beef and biscuits and not too much of that till today.  Dates, prunes and chocolate are all good to send; but toffy is a bit sweet especially when there is not to much drinking water.
