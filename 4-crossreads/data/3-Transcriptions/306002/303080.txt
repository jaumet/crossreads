<p>[Transcriber's note:  Fred Harold Tomlins enlisted in the 1st Australian Light Horse Regiment, C Squadron and became a Signaller.  This is the second of his diaries and covers his experiences in and around Heliopolis and Alexandria, Egypt.  On 9 May 1915 he sails from Alexandria and arrives at Gallipoli on 12 May.  He recounts quite graphically the fighting that took place against the Turks, and writes of those who were wounded and killed during the action.  He is still at Gallipoli at the end of this diary.]</p>
