24/9/15  Gallipolithe afternoon we fired a rocket and then our guns on land & the ships opened.  The warships made the Chessboard a sea of fire.  Our F.A.  engaged the Jolly and all troops rattled away with their rifles.  Some enemy bombs set sandbags on fire in places.  Enemy's artillery replied the 7.5s getting some good hits and buried us in dirt.  They got these good French guns, during the Balkan War.  We located a Turk trench mortar.
25/9/15After sunrise the distant "islands of the blest" looked lovely.  It was so clear that through the telescope looking north west we could see the outlines of the southern coast of Bulgaria.  Have fresh meat now.  Lovely day.  Saw piece of web equipment sticking out of trench pulled it and brought out a mans ribs
