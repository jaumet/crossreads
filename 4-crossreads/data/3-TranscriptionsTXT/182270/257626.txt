 MONDAY, NOVEMBER 10, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; very hot. I went into 
 Quirindi with Al &amp; saw Doc Grey 
 about my leg. He says there is an 
 oil sac bruised &amp; I must rest it 
 for a week or more. Got home for 
 lunch &amp; drove Hobsons pony 
 over to the Ridge &amp; got her shod 
 afterwards. 
 Tickle lopping in Top &amp; Boundary.
