<p>photos from Amiens.</p>
<p>Saturday 23.6.17<br/>Granted a days leave to Amiens but failed to take advantage of it.  Walked to Albert about 4 miles, spent a few hours there &amp; came back by Coal waggon to Millencourt &amp; walked from there to camp.  Great improvement in Albert; becoming more populated daily.  Received mail 22 &amp; 29 April from home on my return.  Weilded the willow for an hour or so at night.  Four more went to Blighty on leave.</p>
<p>Sunday 24.6.17<br/>Wrote my usual weekly letters. Played cricket in evening</p>
<p>Monday 25.6.17<br/>Mixed up <strike>by Orderly officer</strike> on early</p>
