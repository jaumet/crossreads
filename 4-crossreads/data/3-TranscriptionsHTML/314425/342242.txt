<p>part of yesterdays notes. I will try and have a sleep this afternoon feel tired, weary and worn out &amp; degusted.</p>
<p>Tuesday Oct 1. 1918. 1519.<br/>A fine day.<br/>The name of this town is St Emilie and we are camped near a sugar refinery. It is a heap of ruins and is one of the third largest in Europe. It is owned by an English firm &ndash; the makers of Lyles Golden Syrup which is often issued to us. The machinery is French and there is an engineering works attached to it. It has a lathe, the bed of which</p>
<p>is 8 yards long with a gap large enough for turning flywheels.<br/>The paper (Sunday's) is full of good news all along the Western front.<br/>There was an issue of rum last night which I had in bed &amp; this morning we had chocolate, tobacco and cocoa given by the Americans who have a large camp in the factory and we much appreciated it.<br/>I received two letters from my dear wife today No 148. July 28. &amp; 149 Aug 1.<br/><u>Tonight I received a cable from Kittson stating "father died suddenly, Sept. 3. Kittson"</u></p>
