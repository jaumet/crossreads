There is no doubt that we have had a rotten spin of it since we left the regiment, we have been in this camp about a fortnight now & we have been stone broke all the time, & what hurts most their are plenty of canteens, with nearly every thing you can think of for sale.
Do you know that we never recieved any gift stuff or Xmas Billies for Xmas & yet you hear the tale over home their, that every Australian in Egypt gets a Xmas Billie at Xmas, but I can assure you we recieved nothing at all, but never mind I sincerely hope that the war is finished long before next Xmas & that we are all home again, but it doesen't look much like finishing just at present, the way things have been going on other fronts. We have given Jacko a great tickling here.
I bought a pound of Australian butter just before I whent broke, & do you know that I never enjoyed anything so much in all my life before, it was simply lovely. I had not tasted any since I left Australia. This is the best camp I have been in since I joined the army, plenty of good tucker, go to bed when you like & get up when you like & nothing to do, only you are glad to get up as the ground gets very hard & cold with only an oil sheet under you. The natives say that January is the wettest & coldest month here I fairly dread it comming after what we have had already.
I have had no mail or parcels yet. Well I think that I have told you all the news for this time. Remember me to all my friends, give my love to Olive & tell her I will drop her a card when I get one. I hope that Nell has been over with you long before this. Kind regards to the Boss. Good Bye for the Present. Remember me to Dolly & Mabel also Mrs. Logie & Swains.
I remainYour ever LovingW. Weaber
