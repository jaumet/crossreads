<p>Yesterday the 3rd May 1915 broke fast &amp; furious.  We awoke with the din of battle in our ears &amp; after our frugal meal the work of day commenced in earnest.  My path that day took me in to "Death's Valley" (so named on account of the number of dead lying therein) &amp; I might add I didn't feel too comfy considering a sniper was taking various shots.  The weather was hot &amp; the stench from dead animals &amp; probably humans was terrific.  I had recourse to Sal volatile throughout the day as my nerves were a little erratic &amp; the continual bang of the mountain guns &ndash; four in number &ndash; at close quarters did not improve a very bad head I was suffering from.  Our boys suffered rather roughly throughout the morning, one being killed outright &amp; four others being wounded.  The lad killed was bending over a wounded comrade at the time he was shot down.  The shrapnel fire was heavy too, &amp; numerous 6 inch shells found their way there also.  I think the enemy have the range of this particular gully to a nicety &amp; probably they are aware that the road is largely used for transport.</p>
