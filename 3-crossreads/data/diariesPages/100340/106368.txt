a bonnie kiddie by now. She will be quite a young woman by the time I get home. I got a few souveniers this time, four different decoration ribbons, 20, 5, 2 1 mark notes watch, ring various other articles, some of the filthiest post cards imaginable, but I soon gave them away.Could tell you quite a lot if I was allowed but anyway it will be some interesting things that I can tell you when I do get home. Well Vol there is no other news I can tell you. Charlie Lewington wishes to be remembered to you Sis. Give my kindest regards to all your folk fondest love to Noni, Sis self from your brother Hal.15526 Pte F H Vick
