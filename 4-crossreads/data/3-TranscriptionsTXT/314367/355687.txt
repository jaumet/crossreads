I was too occupied to feel anxious but all went well - There was a big explosion but no fish - However Fitz had learned how to chuck the hand bomb & that was good - When we left the Fantome I said what about a bandage & some wool? but we didnt need it - Only one soldier has lost his hand up here so far - by dynamite - We got back to the Fantome & were then ordered out to sea at 8pm to patrol - The Yarra called me to see some sick - more malaria - Off I went - Dinner - Up anchor - Darken ship - When that happens I creep - into my cot - I'm useless & so is everyone else - on a darkened ship -I didn't mention I lunched on the Elax with the Captain - I christened him Ajax - He's a Hull man - Yorkshire to the back bone - A good bold man - very powerful - shrewd but ignorant - English to the back bone - He told us the latest news when we first met -
