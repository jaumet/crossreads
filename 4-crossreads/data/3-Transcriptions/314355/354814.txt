<p>May 24<br/>"The Thrush"<br/>A Thrush sings in the rustling wood<br/>Just as in time gone by<br/>When underneath the bough there stood<br/>A vastly different I.</p>
<p>In other woods, where no leaf grows,<br/>Where never thrush sings clear<br/>The song of Iron rang clear for those<br/>Who heard or could not hear.</p>
<p>To-day because of some who would<br/>But cannot hear the call,<br/>A man stands where a boy once stood<br/>And hates to hear it all.</p>
<p>Robert Nichols.<br/>In the Sphere, May 11.</p>
<p>162.<br/>A reading commenced of Shaw's "Getting Married".</p>
<p>"She never understood that married people should take holidays from one another if they are to keep it all fresh."</p>
<p>That would sound terribly like heresy to Roby, in the mood brought about by enjoyed arguing a few nights ago, Roby said &ndash;</p>
<p>"That's one great thing I look forward to", night of close discussing and talking, of the things of interest with my wife.  Perhaps we'll get married on my next leave!"</p>
<p>At Dranoutre at the crossing of the Loche-Kemmel roads, Roby told me of his engagement:  and he told me in the face of my confessed predujice against our chaps marrying Englishwomen.</p>
<p>Shaw is very right in the public confession of the necessity of a holiday from marriage.</p>
<p>May 24<br/>Even six years ago, always the wonder was how two people bound for the term of their natural lives together should manage such friendliness &amp; comradeship as they do.</p>
<p>In the wounderful sense, do I love ---?  Yet I hardly know her! But over all my senses she holds rule, her playing will be a power to demand only reverence and a passionate love, her body is lovely with strong splendid drawing.</p>
<p>163.<br/>T.L.S. of May 16, one announcement of interest beyond others, a forthcoming monograph of Ivan Mestrovic, publishing by Williams and Norgate: a limited edition, containing sixty four collotype plates.</p>
<p>He is the sculptor of magnificent torsoes, and of splendid men.</p>
<p>Will Dyson's "Australia at War" with a dedicatory poem by W.D., and an introduction by G.K.C., Palmer and Hayward the publishers.</p>
<p>The first printing of Alec Waugh's "Resentment &amp; O.P." will be ready in a fortnight, 500 copies printed.</p>
<p>164.<br/>p.m.<br/>A dull day, restlessly slept through.  On Duty in a mood of dopeness and moodiness.  The guns smashing breaks clear to the nerves at the back of the head.</p>
