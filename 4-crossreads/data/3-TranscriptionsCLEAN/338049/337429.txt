Wednesday 7 AugustFound 2 lineman out on line on arrival so turned in about 1 a.m. Up at 8 am. breakfasted etc. Afternoon out on line. Removed faults. Saw Norm Opie & George Suckling.
Plenty of tanks about. Preparations evidently completed, everybody waiting to jump. Detailed to H.A. with Lovekin. Packed and marched to H.A. in record time. (Maintaining armoured cable). Got a cramped position in a little hole & managed a little sleep.
