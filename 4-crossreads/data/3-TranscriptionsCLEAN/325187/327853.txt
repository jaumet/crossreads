 Under separate cover sending you some snap shots & a Palm Cross, given me by an Arab Child last Sunday. Lovely moonlight nights & no ill effects except temporary usual  over  from inoculation I've been punctured so often now I must be full of alien Bacillus but sickness is very prevalent here (Love to all & hope these notes reach you all at home safely) omit I see Parson Rogers is also writing his impressions, wonder  you  the paper does not get tired of printing Soldiers letters etc.  think I'll knock off if we don't get some fighting soon, but its for you Mother dear I do it, as you see my daily life.
