Food beyond a bare existance was unobtainable for any money.  We hear today of the 52nd Division going to the Dardenelles &amp; Constantinople to take over the forts &amp; that the H.M.T. Indarra &amp; Canberra are likely to go there in the course of a few days.

Very few ships here as the transports during the last few months did not have Alexandria as a base.  The Troops are still on board &amp; are leaving in the morning by train to Palastine.</p>
