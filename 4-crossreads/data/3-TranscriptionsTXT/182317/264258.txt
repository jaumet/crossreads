Overseas Training Bde, Warminster 22.2.18Dear FergieWhy the hell haven't you written you old malingerer - when I see you next, my boy, I am going to kick your posterior until your nasal organ becomes sanguinary. Well old thing and how do you like Sydney? - is it much better than Amiens? - not 'arf. I have heard lately from several people who have seen you lately, saying that you were looking well etc. They must have been lucky I suppose & seen you during one of your few sober intervals. Still as long as you can keep up a good appearance do so by all means. Well my son I have clicked this time good & hard. After coming through all the big stunts without stopping anything larger than a crump I was sent over here for six months spell down at the above address - and here I hope to stay until
