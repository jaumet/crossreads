<p>A large number of our men sent to Hospital.  This is the weather to cripple men.</p>
<p>29.10.1916   Again wet, 400 rounds of ammunition sent to Bty.  One horse crippled, fell down, and cut his hind heels almost off.  Shoeing horses under tarpaulin, leaking like a sieve.  A bit of a stunt on.  Infantry going to trenches.  15 inch guns near us, firing during the night, report, terrific.  I never saw so many dead horse in my life as here, strewn all over the place, get in a bog, useless to try and get them out, shoot them where they are.</p>
<p>30.10.1916   Raining in torrents, bitterly cold.  First casualty in this position yesterday.  Gr Jones had one leg shot off accidently.  The signal, S.O.S was sent up.   (our guns are always laid on this targate, when cease fire is given)  He and Gr Gibson rushed to the gun to fire it, Gibson got there first and pulled to firing lever, just a Jones was in front of muzzle.  396 round of ammunition to guns.</p>
