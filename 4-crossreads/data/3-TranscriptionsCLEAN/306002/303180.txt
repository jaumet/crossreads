  
 7.6.15 Mon. 7th.  The latest rumor is that a peace conference is being held in Constantinople at present.  A sheet of paper is printed here daily & pasted up on the beach for the benefit of the troops, the news it contains is practically about what we are doing & can see;  there is practically no news of the fighting in France, & as we are about 3 miles from the beach & my cold is too bad to go in swimming at present, & have no opportunity to read the "Peninsular Press".  Received more pills this morning from the Dr. & they seem to be doing my cold good.  On duty at 12 oclock.  Mylie Edwards is brick to keep the papers up to me as he does every mail.
