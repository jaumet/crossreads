  
 ornament or inscription, the mummy & lid have disappeared they say it is in the British Museum - There are 2 other Pyramids quite close to the great Pyramids namely Krephren &  MyKerinos. Krephren is 445 ft high & MyKerinos 225 ft high. The Sphinx is also quite near here. It takes about an hour to run out in the tram & is a grand run. I had my fortune told right in the Kings Chamber something like this - I am going to be married, will receive 16 days (800 Pts) will be back in Australia 2 months & 13 days from date. Will get some shot or shrapnel in the back, but will get over it quickly, Going to attain a much higher rank - Wouldn't advise any nervous person to visit the Pyramids - as I suppose only some 75 percent of Soldiers complete the Tour. Had a run around Cairo at night & back in camp at 10 pm.
