<p>I fell headlong on the sharp stone severely cutting my shin &amp; knee. likewise cutting a hole in my pants. So I came back to the tent. Never mind &ndash; worse things happened have happened in Gallipoli any day. Have completed re-writing the records of all messages received and sent on the Peninsular. and they make interesting reading apart from their military worth. The weather was very foggy this morning <strike>this morning</strike> and it was impossible to see more than 100 yards <strike>on</strike> in any direction. Sent out a signals station (Heliograph) about 4 miles out. The men are improving and soon they will be first class. Phillips of "C" Squadron comes on my staff tonight in place of Butler who has gone to hospital- must keep the number up at all costs. I had a long ride this morning across the desert but O! what scenery! Arid barran waste nothing to relieve the monotony. Undulating pebbly, sand hills for countless miles to the West not a bush can grow in such barren waste. About 15 miles to the West is a low range of hills which seem about 30 feet or perhaps a little more high we cannot go too far in that direction on account of roving bands of Bedouin Arabs. and Senussi Arabs who make long treks out from the various oasis to engage our people in battle. We shall go in that</p>
