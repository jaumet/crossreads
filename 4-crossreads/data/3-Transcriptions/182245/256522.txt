<p>JANUARY 1917</p>
<p>7 SUNDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny. They called for six</p>
<p>volunteers to go for a warm bath</p>
<p>&amp; I was one. We marched about three</p>
<p>miles &amp; we had a luke&nbsp;warm</p>
<p>shower, but it was the most enjoyable</p>
<p>bath I have ever had. It was the</p>
<p>first bath - or rather the first time</p>
<p>I had had my clothes off for that</p>
<p>matter since the night before I left</p>
<p>Larkhill, ten days ago. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness and dragging guns out</p>
<p>into position ready to move off</p>
<p>tomorrow morning all afternoon. I</p>
<p>was on horse picket at night. Saw</p>
<p>an airoplane brought down in</p>
<p>flames in morning. Got lots of letters</p>
<p>in afternoon &amp; parcels, the first from</p>
<p>home for six weeks.</p>
