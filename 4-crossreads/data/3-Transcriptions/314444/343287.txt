<p>Dear Theo.</p>
<p>We are loading for home at last and very pleased about it; supposed to finish loading on the 3rd May but expect it will be the 5th.  From here we go to Colombo, deliver about 2000 tons of cargo and fill up again for London.  It is about 5 days steaming to Colombo, about ten days stay there, fifteen or sixteen days to Port Said and about the same from there to London.  If the above schedule is carried out we should arrive about the 21st June.</p>
<p>We have been ashore a few times and find the place very much like other Indian towns, except a large proportion of the inhabitants are Chinese, and the people smoke Burma cheroots, even the Chinese</p>
