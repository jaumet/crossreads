  
 I had a lengthy talk with Mr. Hunter  this  He thinks it would be much better for myself not to do anything at present but to wait until after the war, for there would be a risk of some one attempting to copy my ideas, and the war office might not take it up, as it is not a man killing device though it would possibly help to shorten the war by supplying cheap motor power. I bought 4 nice silk post cards to day in a little shop adjoining the A. L. Epinette Estaminet. They cost 6d each and I sent them to the following. My wife my two nieces, Maggie and Kitty Kittson and Mrs. W. Riley coolaness Envinstown, Ireland, and Mrs Kitty Marbin, Iniselin, Tertigo, Fermanagh. There is good news in the papers which did not arrive until late this evening. Italy had won a great victory and pierced the Austrian line on her second war anniversary. She has captured many strong points with the help of 10 British batteries and taken 9000 prisoners. Since May 1 the French have taken 8600 unwounded German prisoners. There was a raid by 4 Zeppelins over E. cost towns in England.
