who this is, I then had another look recognised him at once Don Nicholls he has changed hardly at all, we had a bit of a yarn then struck out, the road is a bonza all the way in about 9 miles I enjoyed the ride in spite of the awful machines we were on, the country is very pretty all round here the crops along the road are very good. Frome is a fair sized place, but with the funniest poky little streets as ever I have seen you can't drive a horse cart down some of them the town is built on 7 hills is a fairly lively little joint tons of girls knocking about but they were not of a type that appealed to me, we went to this friend of Lens there were introductions all round of course then some tea bread butter cake etc
