<p>My Dear Father</p>
<p>I have just finished a long letter to Mother with half the news. We are off again tonight &amp; I am very busy today, I had one of my best men killed early in the attack on Aug 4th. He has left &pound;7.10 to mind &amp; as I have no chance from here of getting the money changed &amp; sending it to his wife the O/C suggested the best plan would be for me to keep the money &amp; pay his wife from the other end. I would be very glad if you would send this amount &pound;7.10 to</p>
