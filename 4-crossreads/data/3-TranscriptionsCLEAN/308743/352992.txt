 A heavy bombardment took place opposite Gabe Tepe & 15000 Scots are reported to have been landed there we could observe cruise shelling shore heavily with shrapnel & the destroyers are yapping close into the shore our right flank opposite the Lonesome Pine had advanced & successfully taken the 1st trench of Turks they then went on & took 8 more but had to retire as our ships out at sea were shelling these trenches.  News from the Cape says that our troops have advanced 1100 yds & taken 5 lines of trenches troopers are everywhere around the coast  The Monitor has been firing all day & JJ has dropped 8 in our lines but have done no harm.  We had fairly heavy losses but we must look for this when such operations are ordered.  We expect a very heavy counter attack tonight but are in the best of health for it swimming at 7.30 is great, We blew out another MG by our 18 pounders 
 29 June 1915 Tuesday Pere died yesterday The counter came alright a real beaut they attacked all along the line, we were greatly helped by the aid of our star shell as our positions had been consolidated throughout the early part of the night they found it more than they could do. A heavy bombardment was going on all day today down at the Cape & quite a number of fires are breaking out all over the hill.  The French advanced another 350 yds & held it.  The 1st Brig is off for a spell to Imbros the 1st & 2nd Btns Heavy artillery fire has been directed on us all day especially down at the beach where high explosive has been playing all day doing a fair bit of damage Our losses for the advance were 250 so we did extremely well, an aeroplane was up during the attack last night we couldn't find out who she belonged to, but not much importance is attached to the fact as the night was fairly dark
