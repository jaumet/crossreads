<p>exploration with the view in mind that a reign of stalemate existed in this region for 2 years &amp; consequently much time was available for perfecting the defences of which I am writing. Of the German trenches themselves, they present a very sorry appearance, having been battered &amp; torn about by the terrific artillery fire which they were subjected to. To a depth of 10 feet the fire was most effective but beyond this depth not much damage was done.</p>
<p>The trenches wind in zig zag all over the place always presenting an angle to the line of fire &amp; in each bay of the trenches, marvellously executed work in the shape of dugouts &amp; underground chambers are built.</p>
<p>These dugouts or underground passages run down to a great depth, one in particular being 100 feet below the level of the ground. The entrances are well finished &amp; boarded in, properly built steps lead down, some of which have several flights of stairs &amp; fully 20 bedrooms &amp; chambers leading off from each flight.</p>
<p>Air machines on top pump the air down through tubes &amp; in one case there was a light railway track constructed which worked by a windlass.</p>
<p>The value of such construction is at once apparent, during a bombardment the defenders can leave the trench &amp; remain in perfect safety, until the fire ceases then re-appearing they were always able to repulse all attacks. However this availed them little against</p>
