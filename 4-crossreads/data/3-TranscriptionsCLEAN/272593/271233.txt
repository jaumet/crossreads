  
 After coming back we had to set to & clean all the mud off our dirty clothes and equipment & we also got our packs which enabled us to shave & kid "we did not want it   then in the afternoon we had a short parade more for inspection than for anything else. I am still feeling far from well & passed a most restless night. Brigade has just issued an order that we are to have 2 days rest  but I'll bet we get very little peace what with one thing & another While here  we are running a "Sergts Mess" so we will fare very well for food & it will be very convenient   Heavy bombardment all along the front we can hear quite plain from here the rumble of the "heavies" I wonder what it means
