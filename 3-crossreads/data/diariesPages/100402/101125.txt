Shelling off on all day a few cases but of course taken by the ford except a few this morning one to-night in the pouring rain. We are now just to the right of behind Chignes to the South of the Somme River. Prisoners are now estimated at 2,400,000 unwounded our casualties were not remarkably heavy for the extent of the stunt, it was most successful.

Fine` to-day very quiet. We, the Division, is to be releived to-night. Rumours of big offensive all along British line part of French are current. A big blow is supposed to be struck here to-morrow. Just up the Chignes road is a tremendous German gun which I had a look at to-night. It is about 15" with very long barrel its mountings etc. are enormous. Guns are being moved up to here, quite close to the line.
