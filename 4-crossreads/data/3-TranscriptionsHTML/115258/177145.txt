<p>guide, and it is wonderful how simple they are to understand, but I wont try to tell you about them because since coming back to Cairo I have been looking up some books, and I&#39;m not quite certain weather our guide did not make up some of his translations, just on the spur of the moment for our special benifit, and although it was very interesting to listen too, you might go and bowl me out if I wrote it down here. Mind you I&#39;m not saying anything against our guide; it was wonderful what he knew about the Ancient Egyptians and he was able to answer all our questions straight off, with out hesertation. But we kept notes of a lot of things he told us, <s>but</s> and have compared them with some books here, <s>but </s>and it seems to us that Phlinders Petree, and other writers also, have been horribly inacurite in some of their translations. Anyhow I&#39;m reading up a bit of Egyptology now, and taking an interest in it, so I may be able to explain</p>
