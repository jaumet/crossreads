<p>Tuesday 27 June 1916<br/>Very wet &amp; miserable day making everything underfoot in a fearful state. Not much other than censoring &amp; writing a few letters during the day, excepting when Fritz started to shell the place just opposite, landing shells all round our place &amp; making us get out into the shelter trenches in a violent hurry. A very quiet night.</p>
