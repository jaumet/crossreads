<p>16-5-19 (Frid)<br/>Have breakfast in bed always at this place &ndash; it is the only meal they serve &amp; catch train back to camp.</p>
<p>The countryside is a glorious patch of enclosed fields with yellow buttercup lawns &amp; flowering white hawthorn hedges whilst everywhere trickles small rivulets.</p>
<p>I arrive at camp &amp; no one knows anything of NME &amp; I wish I had stayed in London as this trip has cost me 16/- &amp; a fatiguing walk of nearly 3 miles to camp. After dinner I wander up on the hill which rises steeply in rear of our quarters.</p>
<p>The whole side is covered with primrose &amp; daisy &amp; a small blue flower a glorious <strike>coloured</strike> carpet of colour while as if this were not beautiful enough, every flower is connected with silvery threads of spiders forming a silken avenue stretching away to the setting sun. The scene below is beautiful.</p>
<p>All fields now covered by the young crops are carpets of vivid green below like a snake amongst the lovely winds with many a twist a little rivulet which somewhere perhaps becomes a river. The picturesque train (now normal length 10 carriages) in the distance with typical white steam &ndash; the hedges now irregular with over hanging boughs &ndash; here &amp; there a thicket or copse and a plantation denser by its very isolation form a picture that one only expects to see in a book.</p>
<p>Although it is 8.45 the sun</p>
