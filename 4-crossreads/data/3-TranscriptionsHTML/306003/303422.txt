<p>9-7-16<br/>Sun 9th<br/>We filed on to the parade ground up to time last night, &amp; at 11 oclock the Bde (minus 3rd Regt) started for Oghratina  had a good trip as the night was cool, &amp; arrived at Oghratina at daylight this morning &amp; soon after heard 3 aeroplane bombs go off a long way out. (apparently the 2nd had got somewhere near the enemy)</p>
<p>We fed &amp; watered our horses, had breakfast, &amp; commenced our return journey at 10.30 this morning &amp; arrived back in camp at 3.30 this afternoon, a cool breeze was blowing from the sea &amp; the ride was not uncomfortable;<br/>I asked Mills what he thought of the trip when he got back &amp; he said he will be much more contented as Sig Sergeant in the detail camp after &amp; is not a anxious to get back to the Regt as he was.</p>
