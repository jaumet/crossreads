<p>22/9/17 Westhoeke [Westhoek]<br/>crouched in a rotten little trench devoid of any sort of cover. Walked back to BattHQ. The Westhoek road is still very clearly discernable &amp; wanders along the waste of desolation but still retains some of its characteristics as a pleasant country road &ndash; in one place there is a little green bank nearly untouched. Our track lay through marshy shell holes and will need raised duckboards or bridges in wet weather. In one shell hole lay the body of a young German soldier in water up to the armpits. It was like a waxen image &ndash; dead white face bright blue eyes and their ugly steel helmet. Little Fry the runner remarked "He ain't been ratted yet surely." On arrival back at H.Q. we found that the redoubtable OP. Hunt my batman <u>had</u> been out early in the day and duly ratted the corpse. My OP Hunt does not miss much!. The General called in during the afternoon and had a yarn. All our men tonight are on fatigue. Our LGs. put in some work at Taubes. Heavy barrages put over on our left at 6 p.m. very heavy.</p>
