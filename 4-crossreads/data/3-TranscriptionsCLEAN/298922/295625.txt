 During the night we came on to PLYMOUTH. Our skipper tells us we passed 2 subs!! but too dark to see us - so alls well. 
  Posted letters to Laura & Mrs. ISH.  
 The "camouflage"? on the boats is most quaint. With glasses the banding of paint put on in curves shows better than straight lines. Ships painters have certainly been allowed full play to their imagination. Our crew are a cross of Portugese & Indian & the Stewards excellent fellows.
