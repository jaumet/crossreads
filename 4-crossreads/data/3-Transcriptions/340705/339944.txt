<p>need to repeat it in this.</p>
<p>I am enclosing in this several [indecipherable] prints.  They are not good, owing (i) to the fact that I don't know the camera to well yet, and (ii) a slight defect in same (not me, the camera I mean).  If you get the one of myself intensified, it may make a good print.  (Note the bonza Farmer &amp; Co. cardigan.)</p>
<p>I was very sorry to hear that [indecipherable] had failed.  Remember him to me (and to all our pals) &amp; wish him better luck next time, for me.</p>
<p>Nothing else this week, will send some more films on, at an early date.</p>
<p>Ever your affectionate<br/>Eric.</p>
<p>Enclosed (if it passes the Censor) you will find a post card, giving you some idea of where we are.</p>
<p>Also a few negatives of interest.  The one of myself can be improved by getting it intensified.</p>
