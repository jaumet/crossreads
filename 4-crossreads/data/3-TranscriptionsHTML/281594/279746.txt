<p>Egypt, in fact, she was the last nurse that I had worked with before I left to go to Anzac. She had, had six boys working with her but none could agree with her perculiar manner.

<p>Dec 24th.<br/>Working in Ward. Plenty of running about fixing things for the Xmas Celebrations</p>
<p>Dec 25th.<br/>Xmas Boxes issued to all, splendid breakfast.<br/>A sumptuous dinner was provided for the patients dinner.</p>
<p>The ward was very nicely decorated.</p>
<p>After our busy time fixing up the patients with their dinner, a thing that was no small job, the staff had theirs</p>
<p>It was a perfect feast of good things. We had:<br/>Soup; Poultry, Bacon, Potatoes, Peas and Beans; Roast Pork  &amp; Sauce; Plum Pudding  &amp; Sauce; Custard  &amp; Jelly;</p>
<p>On the table there was also Champagne, Beer, Aerated Waters, Sweets, Raisins, Dates and Almonds galore.</p>
<p>To be so near the firing line and to have so rich a feast was inconceivable to any one but those who were there. The cooks had been working for the last forty-eight hours continuously for the making of these dishes.</p>
