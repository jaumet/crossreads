<p>Profiting by previous experience, the Sultan, his entourage, and all those rich enough to follow his example, have gone to Alexandria, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, for the summer time, there they will be far removed from the dessert, and the cool breezes from the water will frequently blow upon them, while here in Cairo the inhabitants will be sweltering in the heated air.
