<p>(From a letter from Capt. MacCallum, 2nd. Div. Staff)</p>
<p>&hellip;..Talking of Bapaume, a funny anecdote is related of a war correspondent who wanted to get "hot stuff" copy for his paper, so about five days after it had been taken and the fires put out, he gathered some chips, started a blaze, added wet fuel, and having got a great smoke induced the old Battalion band to march through under the eye of his cinematographer &ndash; the picture to be entitled "Gallant Anzacs entering Burning Bapaume led by a Band". Rot, isn't it? I hope this thing is censored&hellip;.</p>
