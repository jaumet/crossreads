To / Lieut. Col. Travers D.S.O.
26th Battn A.I.F.
 
On the occasion of the Battalion having completed One thousand days' Active Service, the present Officers, who are original members of the Battalion, held a Dinner in Lumbres, France, on the 9th Instant, to commemorate the event.
When acknowledging the toast "THE BATTALION", the Commanding Officer- Lieutenant-Colonel E.F. Martin, C.M.G., D.S.O.- read out a list of the names of old Officers, who, through the fortunes of war, could not be present, and who it was felt, might appreciate the fact that their associations with and services for our Battalion, were not forgotten by those at present serving.
Enclosed you will find a list of these Officers, which doubtless will be of interest to you.
On behalf of the Commanding Officer and your Comrades in the old Battalion, will you please accept an expression of best wishes and greetings on this occasion.
[Signature]
Major.
