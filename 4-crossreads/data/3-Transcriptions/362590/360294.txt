<p>I enclose Myles' last letter &ndash;</p>
<p>Queen St<br/>24.1.16<br/>Dear Judge Ferguson</p>
<p>For my souls good I strolled across to the Agricultural ground this evening hoping for a glimpse of Keith.</p>
<p>A sentry told me I'd find him past the dog-kennels near the skating rink. I wandered through innumerable buildings dedicated to trade &ndash; ultimately discovered his sleeping quarters &ndash; a pleasant airy little building dedicated, if I remember right to Comstocks worm tablets &ndash; or was it Weagh's Baking Powder? He was not there.</p>
<p>Post-ultimately I found him surrounded by some NZ cons[cripts?] in Ayres Sarsaparilla!</p>
<p>There were two notices that seemed applicable to myself. One &ndash; on the door &ndash; said "Men not admitted here, so GET OUT", the other &ndash; on the door-post said "This post will stand up by itself, &amp; doesn't need your support". I noted that the writing was <u>not</u> Keiths (which by the way is extraordinary like yours). He came out, having settled his business, with face glowing &amp; in fine spirits &ndash; given up the Adjutancy &ndash; back in</p>
