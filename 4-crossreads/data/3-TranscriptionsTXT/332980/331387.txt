Afterwards we met two nice young Ladies who took us for a Walk through the Aristocratic Part of Aberdeen where we saw some beautiful Mansion's all built of Grey Granite & standing well back from the Footpaths & each place had beautiful Lawns & Flower Beds which were at their best, the Streets were very clean & long Avenue of Chestnut Trees were growing, a number had Small Red Flowers while others were Yellow. We all promenaded about enjoying the Scenery & also the Young Ladies Company until close on 11 Pm when we said Good Bye & both returned to our Hotel, well satisfied with another day's enjoyment.
Friday 21stAfter Breakfast, both of us paid a visit to the Fish Market where we saw an enormous quantity of Fish of all sizes, names, & still more was being unloaded from the Fishing Trawlers, along the Wharves alongside, We were both interested very much in the way the Scotch Girls handled the Fish, they are big girls & very strong & their arms are as big as any Man's Arm & they wear High Gum Boots
