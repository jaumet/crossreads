<p>April 2, 3<br/>of the Camerons:  one a short stocky Scot, broad and rich in his phrases:  the other of medium height, and lovely build;  his face, hands and knees burned golden, with rich blood under:  a slim grace about his body, and nervely splendid legs &ndash; "shewed splendidly, and sunburned to the bone!"  His voice soft and clear, and his expressions following each word &ndash; a mythopoem of all Scotland!</p>
<p>Heavy rain after a day of sun and passing clouds.</p>
<p>April 3<br/>31.<br/>Hoograaf, Billets<br/>M.D.S. La Clytte taken over this morning by Tommies:  left there about 11 and arrived here about midday &ndash; in hut Billets in a cold camp.  Rumour of waiting here till 5th then entraining for --?  The villagers tell us we're <u>not</u> going to the Somme, usually they know more than we, so the old rumour of Nieuport resurrects itself.</p>
<p>32.<br/>The last incident of La Clytte:  at 2 a.m. the night-staff got even &ndash; inspired by "that &ndash; Woodbiner" &ndash; with the day staff.  At 2 about four on either side of the long bow hut, arrived with short iron staves, at a given word started a running of the staves over the iron corrugated roof.</p>
<p>I lay stiff and dead in the instant, striving to feel the falling all over of bricks and tangled iron, the next instant I knew the Boche was all round us, riddling the hut with M.G. bullets, then we all recovered, and the curses of a full hut rang down the night.</p>
<p>The moment of sudden awakening was the worst I've ever known.  Five minutes later shells of long range guns purred over us.</p>
<p>Tonight a sleeping with one blanket, and a great coat.  It'll be trooper fashion again.</p>
<p>Short letter written &amp; posted to Mother, and letter to T.B.C. written yesterday.</p>
<p>33.<br/>Time and again, in reverie, or walking alone the last line of one of William Watson's poems has gone singing through my ming [mind ?].  "The throb of the bliss of the rose, and the pomp of the nightingale's pain".  Tonight on the grout for safety pins to manipulate a single blanket.  Charles T. passed me &ndash; from Basil &ndash; the Dec. Today with the full poem and a sketch book.  So I copy tonight the poem on the first page of this journal.</p>
