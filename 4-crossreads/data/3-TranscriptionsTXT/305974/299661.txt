 2 Thursday We left Vauchelles-les-Domart about 9.30 am &amp; marched to Picquigny arriving there about 2 pm.  It was very muddy &amp; raining all the way, owing to having very bad boots my feet were soaken wet.  It was very hilly country we passed through &amp; altogether the scenery was very pretty.  Picquigny is a fairly large place &amp; now is full of Australians &amp; Tommies.  Had a look round the town during the evening.  Paid 40 Francs in the evening. 
 3 Friday There appears to be a very large factory near here as the whistle is continually blowing.  We are billeted in what used to be a fairly large place &amp; A. section Bearers are in a large room on the third floor, we are very comfortably quartered.  7 bearers &amp; 3 tent division are allowed leave to Amiens daily, I am putting in for leave tomorrow, but as only  small percentage is allowed off I may not get it.  The weather is very good now but very cold of a morning. 
 4 Saturday We had gas helmet drill with the box respirators &amp; a route march in the morning, owing to having bad boots &amp; sore feet I didn't go on the route march.  There was a football match on this afternoon between this Amb &amp; the 16th Battalion, the 16th Battalion won.  About thirty of us had to go down to the Somme river &amp; wash waggon in the afternoon. 
 5 Sunday Got leave for Amiens &amp; after waiting 3 hrs for a train we eventually arrived there.  It is about 8 miles from here &amp; is a large City.  I had a splendid time.
