The Bourse, Gare Centrale, a splendid large station alongside the zoo, the zoo itself which contained few animals however as most had been destroyed.  Had rather a fine aquarium & garden also several Australian Cockatoos living in an open cage, the weather apparently not affecting them.  Saw were Vandycke the painter was born and a statue to Petro Paulo Rubens in the Place Vertu.  Purchased some Post Cards & Souvenir books & on visiting a large establishment to buy illustrated books, met a Belgian who had lived in America for many years.  Had a long yarn with him also tea at the tearooms of the establishment.  In a Jewellers shop met two girls who spoke English well and spent an hour yarning to them.  Was astonished to learn that they had heard of our Sundowners
