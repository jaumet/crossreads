<p>July 1  Sunday</p>
<p>Delightful warm day. Jean &amp; I had breakfast at 10.30. Met Dr Russell &amp; Mrs Hunter as well as other workers from various parts. Then we attended service at the Abbey &amp; went by U. to Hyde Pk &ndash; such a way to go. Jean went out to Watford while I returned to Hotel to rest &amp; write letters. Nell came to see me &amp; stayed late.</p>
