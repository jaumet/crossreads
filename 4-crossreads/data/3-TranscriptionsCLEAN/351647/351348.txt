  
 &it does seem to be a bit tough but I hope things will settle a bit or I'll get a bit more used to it. 
 I haven't seen Alison or anyone for ages nor had any word from you either but hope to soon.  I got the socks & the mufflers, thanks so much, they will be most welcome & Graham's photo is simply splendid. 
 My love to Mac & the Boss & Graham.  Tell Mac to write. 
 Much love to yourself.  I wish the war were over & I were back at Tog. 
 Yours as ever Wilkie
