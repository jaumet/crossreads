<p>235<br/>routine of a soldiers life. Bombing, bayonet fighting, organised games, swimming.</p>

<p>One incident I will mention happened me here. It was in connection with some 2 chaps in the company. I had made friends with a very nice chap, he came from a good home and we got on very well with each other. He was quite in the way of being a mate. This other fellow was one who had a partiality for nicely brought up young lads and they in turn liked him. I was asked one day by the young man if I thought it good to go with the other chap.
