Dearest Joker and BobbieMany thanks for your letters and am joly glad to hear you are having a good time -  I wish I was there to row you about and carry things etc. The rotten stuff my eye is dressed with twice a day has made the eye inflamed andvery painful - They are going to make the stuff weaker so hope thisevening I won't have to go through the torture I had this morning -
I have written to -oult as having her over here to go punting - She said in her letter that her mother was going to Walton so I hope she  comes along too - She also sent me a number of snap shots of Lea which were good also one of myself mashing potatoes - Charlie is very fit but we are both a bit cut up over the casualties in the Dardanelles. Our regiment left Auckland with nearly 700 men - There are only 140 alive today - I am the only one out of my tent alive
