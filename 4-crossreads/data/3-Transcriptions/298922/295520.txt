<p>Sunday 29 July 1917</p>
<p>As the Regiment is broken into separate squadrons one in each Redoubt, no Church Parade this morning.</p>
<p>Septic leg better, a Camp is started at Port Said for Septic Sores 8 days each man in turn but I am only just back but a man's BOILERS cannot be too good after 3 years of Tinned dog etc.:-  The rations are better than ever were issued in S. Africa.</p>
<p>I am not grousing but once this Regt. left Galipoli not one single English decoration has been given, Romani Katia El Arish, MAGDHABA Rafa etc. a Croix de Guerre or Serbian Medal came this way, that is all. The men think a lot of these things.</p>
