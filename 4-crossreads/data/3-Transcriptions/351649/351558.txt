<p>they prove themselves worth it.</p>
<p>Katherine sent me a whole lot of socks lately &ndash; I also got a beautiful little pencil out of one very mutilated parcel, which some one had torn open, &amp; all the address nearly gone.</p>
<p>I'd never have known you'd sent it to me but for one little tag still stuck on the corner:  it was jolly good of you to have worried, but really the pencil has been of greatest service &amp; just fits in my pocket book:  and as for the little knife in the end, it has already amputated the ends of thousands of cigars:  besides by producing a gold pencil like that, I've often so impressed other fellows that they lend me 5/-, or pay the Bill.</p>
<p>I do hope the old season goes on well, and that 1917 is very prosperous:  goodness knows we want a little prosperity to make up for all the hard times lately:  I should hate to find myself an absolute pauper on my return to Australia, so let's hope Wragge's prophecy of good years till 1920 comes true.</p>
<p>I'm afraid this letter is an extremely dull one, but I'll set to and write another very shortly when I'm in good letter writing form.  Goodbye, best love to big John &amp; little John and to you:  little John must be getting an immense fellow now:  when I get back he will almost be old enough to come on the spree with me.</p>
<p>Remember me to Stella Wheeler if you see her &amp; thank her very much for the Xmas card she sent me.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Jock C. Ellis</p>
