<p>My dearest Mother,</p>
<p>I have just heard that a mail closes this afternoon, so have a few minutes to scribble a note to you all. I was so delighted at receiving your letter yesterday but it made me very homesick. Anyhow I think it best to wait a while before volunteering for Australia.</p>
<p>I'm very well now   &amp;  feeling very fit &ndash; have been on duty a month now. Am very happy in the ward   &amp;  things in general a peaceful. Should just love to have a peep at you all and the garden. Hope you all have A happy Xmas   &amp;  A Prosperous   &amp;  peaceful New Year. From Your loving baby Edith.</p>
