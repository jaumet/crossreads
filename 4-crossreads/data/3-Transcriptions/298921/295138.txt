<p>June, 1915<br/>Wednesday 16<br/>From all I can gather from the wounded I do <u>not</u> think the Turks are mutilating our wounded except odd cases &ndash; I, among all the wounded in Cairo have not found one case so far.<br/>I have posted you some papers at different times &amp; hope you receive them.<br/>What lot did Harry Phillips come with &amp; Fred Knight, they no doubt are now camped opposite, but with so many troops one cannot find individuals &ndash; only an ant out here; &amp; of small consequence.<br/>Weight 12 stone 6 lbs</p>
