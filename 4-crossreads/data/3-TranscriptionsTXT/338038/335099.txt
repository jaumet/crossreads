IIII suppose & Sis will be leaving for England if they stick to the original programme. At present I do not see that I have much chance of falling in with them. Hope their venture is going to turn out well.I have not seen anything of Rex Robert or Olding for some time. They are in a different part of the country from where I am, but the last I heard was they were all well.No more news at present. Mum's letter which you mentioned has not turned up yet so I will wait a day or so before writing her to see if it comes along. With fondest love to yourself Mother & PatI am, Your affectat SonTerenceP.S. Struan Robertson was over to see me last night. He has had a pretty rough time but is O.K. Asks to be remembered to you all TWG
