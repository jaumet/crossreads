  
 us some more of the snow covered fields surrounding B'ham. The afternoon was cold & snowy & so we stayed at home beside the fire and talked & played etc, etc. The evening we spent in much the same way & by midnight we felt just as much at home there as if we had been living there for a month, and, tired out, turned into a nice warm bed & dreamed of ......- by the way, I don't think we dreamed at all. 
 Feb 12 
 Breakfast at 9.30 and by 10.30 we left for town, followed by a very warm invitation from every member of the family, to return upon the first opportunity. One of the daughters, Gladys by name, came into town with us to show us round & to take us to dinner. 
 After buying a few cards & presents for home we called at Mr Sames' shop & he then took the three of us to dinner at the S. & N. W.
