Friday 30-3-17One of the Mill hands went up in an aeroplane with some Captain an Aviator in the Aerodrome close to the Mill.  They went up a few days ago & have not been seen since.  It is believed that they were brought down behind the German lines.  The Mill hands name was Nolan.  I believe they were last seen flying North over Arras.  The Comforts fund staff was blown up by a mine in Bapaume a few days ago.  It is believed that the mine was exploded by a Trip wire set in the Cellar[A mine was left by the Germans under the Town Hall]
