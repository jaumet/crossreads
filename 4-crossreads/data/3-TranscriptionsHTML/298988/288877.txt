<p>May 7th.  The Novian came alongside of us today to get water.  There are Australian Troops on there &amp; they were very glad to get on board of us, as they have no Canteen on their Ship.  It is of some interest to us to meet some of the boys from our way too.  A Launch was alongside of us this morning on their way to the headquarters ship with a Turkish Officer taken prisoner.  He was very well dressed, having putties, good boots uniform &amp; overcoat.  He did not appear to take much interest in the proceedings however.  I offered to buy him as a curio but he wasn't for sale.  It appears that 12 of them rushed into our Trenches &amp; surrendered.  11 of them accidently ? got shot  this one may be useful to get some information out of.  There is a big battle going on at Cape Helles &amp; I understand that a lot depends on it, because the boys at that end are trying to join up with those here &amp; if they do, it will be good bye Gallipoli</p>
<p>Had some excitement on board at 6.30 tonight.  We were skipping on deck &amp; there were about 15 of us assembled, when an Aeroplane was sighted at an enormous height.  We could not make sure whether it was ours or the enemy's &amp; we were craning our necks to see.  When it was right over us, they dropped two bombs &amp; they fell into the water 20 ft astern of us &amp; exploded, throwing water high in the air.  Our Warships then opened fire on it &amp; they turned around &amp; made off, none of the shots reaching it on account of its height.  Presume they saw us two ships together &amp; reckoned we were a good target.</p>
