 23/1/19 Gourdinne Last evening spent a very happy few hours with Gorman chez Yvonne Legait. Sitting round the table we had singing and discussed all the scandals of Belgium &ndash; the Baroness de Vaughan &amp;c. Yvonne is something of a beauty &ndash; natural and unaffected but does not look strong. M. Fernande Crochelet was with us and it was midnight when we parted. This morning it is a leaden sky and powdery drifting snowflakes are falling on the frozen roads and footways. Inspected Headquarters billets. Afternoon took a walk through neighbouring woods &ndash; snow lying round still among the grass and roads and paths icebound. To the edge of Thy le Chateau &amp; then home. Yarned with Gorman and then read and wrote after Mess.
