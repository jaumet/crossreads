I think that I will go down to Surrey to Mrs. Horton. She wrote and invited me down there to spend my convalescing period, but that will not be allowed. So I will wait untill I get my furlough.

The other I will not have a chance of seeing if he is still in Egypt anyway I would stand a very small chance of seeing him, for we do not see much of the A.H.S.C. men they are generally behind at a good distance except when on duty. I am glad that I did not get into the A.S.C. now. The artillery or Engnrs would have suited me but still there is a sporting chance for the "common or garden" Saper The infant. any way we get plenty of work, and Bally the latter does not agree with me and the former I begin to like less less, but what is the use of telling the Cap. he wouldn't believe it really.

I also received a letter from Harry with a Pen ink sketch of a way back
