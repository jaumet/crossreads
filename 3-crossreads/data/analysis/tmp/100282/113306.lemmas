 put me in mind of a hop over with these great bomb burst score of machin gun rattl away , we could get scarc ani sleep the whole night , it was just the night for raid , a brilliant moonlight bright as day , we could see the great " Gotha " quit plain , I do n't know if they brought ani down or what damag they done , must have done some for it was like a battl they just empti them out like cartload of brick back they went for more , by the way they cart their egg over , I should think they had a contract on were get so much per dozen . I can tell you these bomb are not the nicest thing to have fall around you , for you are so helpless against them . Take a line from what is go on now Heaven onli know what next Spring is go to bring forth in the matter of fight in the air , I should not be surpris to see it finish there , both side seem to have given up the idea of go for one anoth like they use to
