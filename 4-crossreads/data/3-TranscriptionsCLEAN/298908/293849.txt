merrily on tins, the greatest day of Englands glory.  I wonder if those old sea heroes of ours Grenville Drake Raleigh & Hawkins have any idea of what this day means to us.  We have come out on top as England nearly always has done after one of the most frightful wars that we have ever been engaged in & the end has been so dramatic & the win so complete that we can hardly grasp the full meaning of it.  wlt When we got news of this the lads were on parade & the message came up telling of the signing of the armistice & the end of the war, the C.O. read it & proclaimed the day a general holiday amidst an outburst of cheering & the lads promptly scattered & made off for the town.  The camp is now practically deserted but I have to stop here till dinner time for I am Depot Orderly Sgt.Saw Freddie Turner & a lot of the boys this morning they came across with the last draft from France.
