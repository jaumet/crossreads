<p>My dear Mother<br/>I received your Saturday letter to day, the boys sent it on up to me. There is only one mail a day here so I dont expect you Tuesday letter till Thursday now and the same with the other days.  I suppose the Wonga ewes are at Cooyal to night and that father will be taking them on in to morrow; I am afraid you have not had any rain but other places seem to have got it and that may make the sheep sell, I hope so any way.<br/>Do you remember what a swelled head Capt. Downes used to suffer from? Well! it has got down in to his throat now and he is away with mumps, that ought to be a lesson for him.</p>
