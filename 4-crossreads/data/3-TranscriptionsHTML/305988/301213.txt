<p>when our platoon &amp;&nbsp;No2 went over &amp;&nbsp;took a German outpost without a casualty. He only had a machine-gun crew &amp;&nbsp;a flare-man in it &amp;&nbsp;when they saw us coming they beat it. The following morning, the 17th, we moved back about 50 yds to enable the 19th Bn to do a stunt. They took an outpost on our left but had to fight for it. In the night we were relieved by the 18th Bn &amp; came back to supports. We relieved each other twice during the next fortnight &amp;&nbsp;then we were relieved by the 6th Bgde &amp; came back to Blangy-Tronville to prepare for the big stunt. On the 6th of August we moved up to a trench in front of Blangy &amp;&nbsp;the following night we moved up to the &quot;hopping off&quot; tape at 10 p.m. We got into position on the tape &amp; had to wait there till 4.20 a.m. &quot;Zero&quot; time. At about 3.30 a very thick fog came down &amp; at 4.20 it was just as thick as ever. At 4.20 a.m. the guns opened up from the right &amp; went right around to the left. The best barrage I have ever heard &amp;&nbsp;it played hell with his trenches. When the guns opened it was a signal for everybody to fix his bayonet &amp;a also for the tanks, who were just behind</p>
