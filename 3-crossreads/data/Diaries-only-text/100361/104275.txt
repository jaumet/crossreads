Had to hop out a few times during the night, but feel a bit easier this morning. Considering we are so near the Line things are very quiet. There are scores of ?planes about. The Gassed Patients all pass thro? here, and there are a few "casuals" like myself. I am on "Light diet" chiefly rice puddings, a thing I don't like too well.
Later. The Guns are roaring away, and the sky is black with "planes". Evidently there is something doing. A day seems like a week here, and I hope to get away tomorrow.
Saw "Snowy" Hargraves today, and we had quite a yarn about the 8th. He tells me George Hill was killed a few days ago, and says I wouldn't recognise the old unit know.

The name of the Hospital "Hospice Fouilloy", and judging by its appearance it was some kind of Hospital before the War. Last night a big number of Tanks went up the Line, so Fritz is in for a merry time.
I could have spent another couple of days in Hospital, but it was so deadly that I came away this morning and reported to W.O. Spriggins at Rail Head Corbie P.O. Here I saw Harling, who was doing the booking. He made me some Tea which was mighty welcome. About mid-day, after a feed of Roast Beef and Bread and Butter, I came along with the mail van, and reported for duty with 11th Brig. H.Q. P.O. Corp Flanagan is in charge. There are 3 chaps in the P.O. and I make 4. 
The name of this village is Etenhens[?]. We passed thro? several other villages, all of which are in a terribly battered condition. Fritz is still being kept on the move, and our chaps are chasing him up. 
The weather is glorious, nice sunshine and blue sky. The F.P.O.[Field Post Office] is situated in the only Farm Building that is intact; and this has only 3 walls left standing.
Had a good Tea of Stew and B and B, and turned into Bunk with a heap of mail bags.
