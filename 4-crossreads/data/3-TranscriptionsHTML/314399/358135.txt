<p>Sunday 18 May 1919<br/>Went looking for a house after doing a bit of packing. No luck tho. Met the girls at 2.20 pm (20 minutes late they were). We intended going to hear Melba but couldn't get in so went &amp; had a look at a church &amp; then to the Museum. Gee its marvellous. Went back to the flat for tea &amp; then to Regent's Park. Janet &amp; I went out to the Hospital at 7.30 pm &amp; the matron insisted on us having dinner with her. Was goodo too. She then made u s use her sitting room while she cleared out a cupboard. Some sport.</p>
<p>Monday 19 May 1919<br/>Went out to see Bill after getting smokes etc for him &amp; he had gone out to see Marie. After driving lesson went out to Maries flat for tea. Janet came in later on. Played cards for a while.</p>
