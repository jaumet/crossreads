<p>10/4/17<br/>Since the grand win yesterday, open fighting continues, in rain and snow. There is no shelter here, I have found a large wooden tub and am living in it like Diogenes the Philosopher; if his cramped quarters were anything like mine I don't wonder that he was a crabbed old gezer.<br/>11/4/17.<br/>Another very bitter day, a great deal of snow and rain. Advanced to the cemetery and dug a funk hole in the side of a sunken road. There is no shell fire here to speak of by either side.<br/>13/4/17.<br/>Came back to the chalk pit yesterday do duty as rations fatigue, was able to get a sleep in a cellar here. We carry hot rations twice a night. We get very little rum here it leaks out at Company Headquarters. The chap who drank it all</p>
