  
 a boatman to row us over to Nelson's old flagship the Victory a guide showed us all over her showed us the spot where Nelson was wounded, & where he died, there are some very fine pictures on her of scenes depicting Nelson life & career, she still has the same type of old muzzle loading cannon on her as were used in those days but she has 4 only of her original cannon's left, she carried altogether 104 guns & the biggest gun she had only threw a solid ball of  stel  steel a distance of 500 yards & weighed 32 lbs some difference to-day. The old sails are still preserved on her they have 150 cannon ball hole's in them, 2 of these old guns are fired daily, one at 4 oclock in the morning
