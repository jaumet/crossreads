blowing from the south all day & the temp. was about 100-105.  The wind instead of dying down - as is usual - upon the approval of night, increased in violence until a gale was blowing which continued all night.Picture us - if you can- in a six x six dugout 2 feet down protected all around & on top by sacking only.  The candle guttered & wilted from the heat (we used three in as many hours).  The dust would blow in through the sacking like slow puffs of smoke and settle on everything.Finally you had to lie with the lightest clothes on & get covered with dust or else get under a blanket & sweat.It was so hot & stuffy & dark that it was impossible to tell without feeling whether one had a blanket over one's head or not.  I got about 3 hours doze & then woke & got up about 5 a.m. with eyes, ears & nose full of dust & found a layer an inch thick over everything.  We moved about 400 yds. today to a new camp on sand & mercifully the wind & heat have ceased.
