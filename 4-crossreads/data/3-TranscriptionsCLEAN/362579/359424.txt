  
  came while I was here. I'm sure we will all enjoy the contents immensely. 
 Tell Eddy his parcel is lovely   &  I shall give him a big hug   &   kiss for them when I come home. It is grand to think one is not forgotten. Only I do wish I could come out to see you all. I shall make inquiries when I get to England. Thank you all for my Xmas Cake   &  hope next one shall be with you all   &  we shall enjoy it together. 
   Fondest love &  kisses to you all. 
 From Yours lovingly Edith
