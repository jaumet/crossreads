 Tuesday Feb 1st 1916   First day out from Brisbane, fixing up Hospital etc, everything "chaos". All AMC. men very busy, getting Hospital ready, unpacking drugs &amp; sorting also all sorts of Surgical instruments, all new &amp; freshly packed by Elliott Bros &ndash; the order must have run into 4 figures, very interesting to say the least. Have made the acquaintance of Dr O'Reilly, Nurse Avenell, Nurse McKenzie, all very nice &amp; they are about as popular with us AMC boys as a blooming private. 10 cases in the Hospital up to 3 pm today &ndash; most by affects of yesterday &amp; vaccination, one accident on board &ndash; man ran a knife thro boot &amp; cut two sinews. Have passed the Paringa outward &amp; the Empire has passed us badly &ndash; very calm only a few sick, tip top myself, eating like a horse, rattling good tucker &amp; plenty of it hope they will keep it up, just got a wireless to arrive Sydney 3 pm  tomorrow.
