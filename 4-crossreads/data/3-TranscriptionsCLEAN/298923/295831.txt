  
 14 June 1918 Friday (X to X crossed out) Very hot Our washing water is from a Malarial Swamp, sticky, brackish & won't lather, & scarce at that but we go back to our horses again in 5 days- I know my writing bad but you will know it is because my pen is so often bad and I scribble under many difficulties at times- X Joe is good to keep the old home in repair & sorry Day has no one to keep her again in the kitchen I note all you say re old Sir Sam but would not like to take Dolly away till end of August now- Love from your son  FW X
