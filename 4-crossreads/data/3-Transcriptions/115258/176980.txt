<p>This morning some reinforcements marched in and with them came Cpl Edwards. I was jolly glad to see him back. He has been nine weeks trying to get out of Moascar; which is a more heart breaking place than a prison we reckon. It does seem a shame to spoil good soldiers like that! Jim Ayre has been appointed &quot;curio king&quot; for the regiment which means that he has to collect trophies for this new war museum they are getting up. I have just been reading that book &quot;The Origin and Nature of Life&quot; for a second time. it is wonderfully interesting alright. Think I&#39;ll stop this gossip now Mother dear and write again soon. Love to Father, Hal &amp; Fred and yourself. I am</p>
