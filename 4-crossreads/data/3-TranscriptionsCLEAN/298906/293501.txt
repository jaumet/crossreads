  
 [23rd July 1917] 23rd. Anniversary of "Pozeries" today, seems a long year to me & one full of changes, about 10 days ago there was a great Memorial Service held on the actual battlefield of "Pozeries" each unit of the 1st Division sent about 30 men who actually fought there to represent the unit it was a great gathering & very impressive I believe, General Birdwood & his staff were there & a fine service was held. What beats me as how they don't erect some permanent memorial at "Poseries' for theres no getting away from the fact that the taking & holding of "Pozeries' was a wonderful feat, especially after the previous unsuccessful attacks by the British troops
