<p>with that &amp; my head.</p>
<p>6.5.16 Saturday<br/>I am far better &amp; in fact &amp; very nearly myself again.<br/>Today I received orders to arrange for the moving of the Camp to Serapeum which is on the Arabian Side of the Canal &amp; consequently well within the War Zone.  However I am led to believe that we will not be there long before we move to France.  I have also been instructed to forward my claim for a Commission so I am feeling very hopeful.</p>
<p>7.5.16 Sunday  8.5.16 Monday<br/>We are still awaiting Train Accommodation to transport us down the Canal.<br/>I was offered a job of CSM on Instructional Staff to teach the men in the Details as they come across, before being drafted  into Regiments, but as there was no promotion attached to it I turned it down.  Moreover, my papers are in for a Commission &amp; I am expecting to hear something very shortly.<br/>The Weather still continues to keep hot.</p>
