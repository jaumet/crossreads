 It is a pleasur to walk along the road here now and see the various crop when we pass through this part a coupl of month ago . The crop were just spring and the Hop vine were just shoot , now the Hop are grow luxuri , they are worth see here they do not grow them on Pole , but on wire first they erect their post for the top wire they are about 20 feet from the ground . then fine wire are attach to these overhead wire and fasten to piec of stronger wire , which are set firm in the ground . The vine are train on the small wire , they look veri pretti grow and I should think that they would be far easier to harvest than when grown on pole , other crop Wheat Oat give promis of a plenti harvest But Bean Pea they grow here to perfect whether they bear well is anoth thing . The Pea Broad bean grow better , than I have ever seen them befor if good green foliag is ani Criterion . Red Clover is anoth crop that grow well . the farmer have cut the first crop for hay and it is still out in the pad field cure in some place they are cut grass for hay today I saw a load on the road when we were march along . how long we will be in this part of Franc I cannot say not veri long I think .
