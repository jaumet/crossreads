Headquarters1st Anzac Corps,4/8/17
Dear Aunt AmyI was so glad to see in the orders the other day that Jack had got his commission. He has done it entirely by himself, and it is a well deserved change in his fortunes. I think he will like the work in the Flying Corps, and it certainly no more dangerous than his work in the Regiment; not as much so, I should say; so you will have that extra comfort from it too. By the number of his squadron I fancy that he will be serving in Egypt and Palestine. I am very glad indeed. I wrote and told Jack of it - both our Jack and yours. With love to Nancy and Joan (I saw Claud looking very fit some time ago, on leave; and I see Cadle has been sent to some work with a unit in England, probably for a bit of rest)- Ever your affectionate nephew,Charlie
