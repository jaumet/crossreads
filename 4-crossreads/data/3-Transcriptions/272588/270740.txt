<p>Friday 19 July<br/>1stly on our front &amp; on the left the 9th Battn. with the 9th Division went over &amp; captured Meteren &amp; 350 prisoners at 7.50 this morning. On the right a 'labour' battn. relieved the 29th Division &amp; were caught changing over.  About 50 casualties for the night. The German advance is held. Rumour is current that the French have made a counter offensive on a twenty five kilo front right flank on German right flank Chateau Thierry &amp; have captured 17000 prisoners, 200 guns &amp; advanced to a depth of 10-12 kilos. Seems very reliable.  "Vive la France".</p>
