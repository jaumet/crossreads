The sea moderated somewhat but the A13 would still viciously roll from one side to the other until the weight of her engines would counteract her tendency to lie flat. She would then return to the other side & so on. A word here may be said about wireless signals, a brief explanation being given of their transmission & reception. Those familiar with electricity should have little difficulty in following.
The ariels may be imagined as the radiator & the hull of the boat is used as a return (via the intervening sea, land or both). Alternating current of convenient voltage is generated usually by a rotary converter driven from the ship's direct current mains. This passes through various switches & choke coils (to prevent any kick back from the self induction of the transformer) and to the transformer. A rather massive telegraph key is included in the low voltage circuit & controls the current to the transformer. This transformer of special design transforms the low tension current to a very high potential
