<p>A 29.3.17</p>
<p>My dear John,<br/>I met your brother Gus in the train last night- and he was telling me about your boy. I feel  I must write firstly to congratulate you on your son's gallant conduct and on his success in winning the decoration he so richly deserves, secondly on his return to Australia.<br/>But last I must sympathise with both him and you on his having been so severely wounded.I sincerely hope the operation</p>
