<p>[Saturday 8 April 1916]</p>
<p>Bought a pair of Boots made by Natives at Technical School for 80 P.T.<br/>Much excitement this morning our 2 Aeroplanes landed close to our Camp been out reconnoitring, they have done the Cavalry out of a job, being able to go many miles out on the Desert.<br/>The Natives swarm around in front, behind simply no use hitting them out of the way.  When propeller goes, they shift.<br/>Impossible to answer all letters, but they are much appreciated.<br/>(Can't say I remember Pvt Street, but I know he was one of the old crowd.)</p>
