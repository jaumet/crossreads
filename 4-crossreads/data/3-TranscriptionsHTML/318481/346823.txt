<p>[Transcriber's note:  The letter dated 7 August 1919 is written to his wife from Marseilles when George Lambert is on his way back to London from Egypt.  The pages after the letter appear to be part of his diary written when he was at Moascar, Egypt towards the end of his time in that country.]</p>
