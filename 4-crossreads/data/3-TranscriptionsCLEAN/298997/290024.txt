  
 Jan 12th A beautiful morning, and everything quiet.  Owing to the mistiness that prevailed in spite of the sunshine it seemed safe enough to get out of the trench & stretch a bit.  There was a tang of spring in the air; and it made me feel as if I was getting rid of mouldiness.  Another man in number six platoon, got out of his possie too.  Then a shell came over, suddenly, and it got him. 
 Maginnis reckons I am off duty today.  I don't know how he worked it but he reckons I am not fit.  Its rotten to have everybody remarking about me looking ill.  We are having a raiding party tonight, and I have asked to be included.  I want to see as many of the features of the war business as I can, of course.  The raid will be sort of revenge for the incident of this morning; but, seeing that it was the artillery away back that settled the account of Brown (he died of wounds) and we are attacking infantry, it is hardly a just revenge. 
 The authorities have just discovered that smoke is a great enemy of gas, driving it out of dugouts etc; and we have received orders that a bundle of twigs is to be kept in each dugout, to set on fire when gas is heavy & penetrates into them.  Quite a lot of our fellows have got slightly gassed, and speak as though they have sore throats.
