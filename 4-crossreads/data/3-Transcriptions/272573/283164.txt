<p>A few shells have been sent into La Gorgue by Fritz. Sisters warned to be ready at a minutes notice. Names of patients taken</p>
<p>April 29th. Sun.<br/>More shelling of La Gorgue. They seem to be after the Railway Station as they put a shell right through the Goods Shed there. Most of the other shells have fallen on vacant ground.</p>
<p>April 30th. Mon<br/>The weather has been simply ideal these last few days.</p>
<p>Since we evacuated our patients we have not been receiving any in. We have also had to hand in our Kit Bags to-day. We have got to carry our gear and it is only a very small quantity that we are allowed to have in our possession.</p>
<p>May 2nd. Wed.<br/>There seems to be a big heavy gun over at La Gorgue sending some solid stuff in to Fritz. The sound of this gun firing is terrific</p>
<p>May 4th. Fri<br/>Had a trip round in an Motor Lorry via Bec a Mor, Croix de Bec, Le Nieppe, Steinwerck, Doulieu.</p>
<p>Nieppe is badly knocked about especially the Church which is in the centre of the town with the houses and shop round about it. There are a number of windmills about this district.</p>
