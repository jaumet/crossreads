 5/9/16 Glasgow - London. Left by the express at 10 a.m. and travelled right down the West of England via Carlisle and Crewe to Rugby and from there across to London. The day was fine and the country showed to advantage. How compact everything is &ndash; too compact for us who are used to large spaces. The country traversed was all farming and, except for stretches near the border, closely farmed. Most of the crops are in the stooks, the meadows looking as if rolled with a lawnmower and a trim hedge round all. Brooks and small rivers, with some canals, intersect the country. Farmhouses appear substantial and comfortable. Running into London we reached Euston and taxied from there to G.N.R. Hotel at Kings Cross. Went down town after lunch and had dinner at one of Lyon's shops and then strolled round in dark, thronged streets. The demi-mondaines were in hordes plying their brisk trade. Searchlights piercing across the sky for Zepps. Made the acquaintance of Jeanette Dumart who lives at Q. Alex. Mansions Grape St Shaftesbury Avenue
