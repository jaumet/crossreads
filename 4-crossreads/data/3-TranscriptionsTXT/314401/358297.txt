Probable that if the enemy is met at night he will be sighted ahead or on either bow, proceeding on an opposite course to us. In either case, squadron will turn away from the enemy; if right ahead, turn to starboard. Sydney will open fire and turn independently as soon as enemy is sighted. Australia will turn away followed by Montcalm, and steer a course approximately parallel to enemy. Sydney to use small helm so as to keep clear of Australia and Montcalm. Should the squadron be overtaking the enemy when sighted, Sydney to alter course about two points away from him, Australia and Montcalm following in succession. Every endeavour is to be made to keep in touch with the enemy in order to engage him at daylight.
