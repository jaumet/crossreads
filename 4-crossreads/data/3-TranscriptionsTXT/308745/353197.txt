Doctor to be sent back as soon as possible.  I went back & got Williams rifle for one of the men who had a cutlass then by that time Dr Pockley came back & attended to Williams.He thanked me for bringing him back & said nothing could be done for him, told me to get help & take him back to the base which I did.  Previous to starting Dr Pockley took his Red Cross brassard from his arm & put it round my white hat.  I asked him how he would manage without one.  He said he would be alright.  Not long after arriving at base Dr Pockley arrived also shot through chest & out through the back.I spoke to him & from it understood him to say he was shot about the same place as W.  From the nature of the wounds I [indecipherable] they must have been shot from a tree with dum-dum or explosive bullets & that is my own experience of the affair.  After a few [indecipherable] & gave the brassard to Eng R A Rial [?] (Royle?) to send to Dr Pockleys mother
I remainYours obedientlyWilliam Kember
