Glasgow. Strolled round the streets nearly all the morning visiting different places of interest and find this a fine modern city with regular braod streets full of a bustling busy people. A fine city nearly twice as large as Melbourne. The trams are run by an enterprising municipality and are of the usual London double deck kind. The conductors are women and in many cases they are also drivers, The lower classes wear the shawl and have bare heads. Girls of 18 19 appear with their babies tucked into the shawl. In Britain one notices a total absence of 3d pieces which results in pocketsful of pennies very soon. In the morning ascertained that all trips through the Caledonian Canal by steamer were off and that passports were necessary for Inverness. Resolved on a modification of the trip getting no further than Oban. Visited the Glasgow Cathedral which is in the old town and rather ?ungetatable". A fine 900 year old (in parts) structure much too large evidently for present day use as seating is only provided from the choir forwards. The crypt beneath the choir is dank and wet. The churchyard is one close paved mass of tombstones (flat). Behind on a hill rises the crowded modern cemetery.
