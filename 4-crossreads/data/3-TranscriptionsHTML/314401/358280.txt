<p>12/8/14 It is now the evening of the 12th &amp; twenty four hours have elapsed since we launched the first attack of the Royal Australian Navy. True it has ended rather flat but thank god there are no disasters to record. The departure of the nominated ships was a striking scene. The lower deck of the flagship was cleared so that they might have some encouragement. At 4.30 Aug 11 we arrived in S. George's Channel, a mile of water separating New Britain or New Pomerania from New Ireland or New Mecklenburgh. We are in hostile territory now &amp; caution is of the utmost necessity. At 5.30 we slacken down but the Sydney followed by his chickens draws aside on our beam &amp; continues on her way. The band strikes up "Advance Australia Fair" and "God Save the King". We cheer each ship three times &amp; each responded &amp; never were cheers so sincere. The wildest rumours are current. It is said that this place has had five millions of money spent on it; that there are fortifications and mines &amp; heavens knows what. In fact our fears multiplied the terror of the night. We cruised off the coast changing course every half hour so that if observations were being taken of our movements [indecipherable] our enemies might not entrap us on any one course. There is a glare in the distance. Ah, says somebody, the searchlights of the fort are being trained on our ships, but we can hear no firing. Every man in the flagship is at his post; I am at mine in the fore transmitting station. There are about 35 men there crowded into about 32 square feet. We are shut down under hatches and the atmosphere is something awful. Besides the transmitting people and my staff, there are the quartermaster &amp; his lot steering the ship from the lower conning tower, and also the relief signal crew ready to rush up into the upper conning tower when the upstairs party is blown out. We smile and make the best of it. Time goes on  &amp; when the moon rises at 10.15 we know that the little entertainment is over. We have drawn a blank. I did not wait for the last edition but turned in to my bunk at 9.00 so painfully indifferent was I to the whole turn out.</p>
