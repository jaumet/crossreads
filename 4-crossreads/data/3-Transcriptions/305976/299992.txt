<p>Tuesday Ap 2<br/>Turks are concentrating &amp; another scrap is expected. The Armoured Cars have gone up to Esault to hold the road. We crossed the Jordan again today &amp; took up again our old positions. Coming along the road it was pitiable to see the Women &amp; Children trying to get back to our line,  knowing that the Turks would Massacre them. We were bombed crossing the River &amp; finally camped near Mt of Temptation on Jericho flat. Worst stunt I was ever in &amp; in my opinion we received a hiding this time.<br/>Wednesday April 3<br/>Jacko bombed at dawn all</p>
