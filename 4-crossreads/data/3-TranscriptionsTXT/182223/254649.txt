 Monday 29 March 1915 On the plateau between 7 &amp; 8 A.M.&nbsp; 8.30 pm. The dust coming again strongly it began&nbsp; jus  at 7-45 a.m. when I was galloping midst the splended air of the Lyssian plateau, blowing from the&nbsp; South. Are there high hills just to the southward?&nbsp; One operation during the afternoon&nbsp; Riding during the afternoon. An active horse that required a long gallop across the&nbsp;sand to steady him.

 Wednesday 31&nbsp;March 1915 Ride before breakfast. Air warm. Locusts. Snails on shrubs, glued to stalk by gum at open End, Alabaster, bones human &amp; other, petrified wood. Moisture deposited on stones before sun rise then evaporated by the sun light gives a coolness&nbsp;to the atmosphere on the ridge of the plateau.&nbsp; Ride during the afternoon across the cultivated lands. Looking at the Locusts on the banks of the Canals, where they were in large numbers  being  the females being impregnated, &amp; it may be getting ready to deposit their eggs. The females are grey the males a bright yellow.
