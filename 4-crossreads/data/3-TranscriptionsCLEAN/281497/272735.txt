  
 with the railway running at the foot, & the great military camps & Hospitals of Etaps, also the town of the same name, it is principally a fishing place & many curious sights are to be seen when walking through it, on the flats below me a lot of our chaps & some "Scotties" are playing football, & about 100 yards from where I am sitting an elderly Y.M.C.A. man is giving they boys his weekly lecture on the French language. 
 It has been a lovely day today something like an Australian day in early spring just cold enough for us to keep our coats on & plenty of sunshine.
