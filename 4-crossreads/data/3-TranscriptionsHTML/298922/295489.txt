<p>Friday 22 June 1917</p>
<p>I hear an Australian mail is in but letters take longer of late &amp; some say they leave Australia via America for Egypt, what a touch. I enclose you snapshots of my Horse the one HLA bought from Harrison. You see he looks well after all his work.</p>
<p>One days pay per Officer &amp; other ranks is being collected for a memorial on Suez Canal in memory of our mates. A life size <u>bronze</u> horse with rider, has been suggested. BRONZE.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]  My pen is bad, but better than pencil. As a mail is going out I send these notes with love to all.</p>
