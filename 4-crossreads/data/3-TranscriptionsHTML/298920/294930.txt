<p>During the past few days many sharks have been noticed swimming around the ship.  Small flying fish abound and many of them fly fairly long distances.  A shoal of them skidding over the waves looks like a swarm of locusts.  A little after 4pm another squall came over and succeeded in keeping the atmosphere cool all night.  The sea became a trifle rough, and kept the deck wet with spray.  Usual training exercises after 8pm but with the ship rolling and tossing it is rather a difficult matter to maintain control of the ball.</p>
