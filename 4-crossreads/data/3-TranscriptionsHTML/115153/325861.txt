<p>outpost in the front line, which necessitated hundreds of yards of wire being reeled out. The Colonel would cut the wires in any part of the field, and our job was to maintain communication with any other post he desired. I might say we did the work very well, and he complimented us upon it. We also had an aeroplane working in conjunction with us, and the mode in which the plane signalled was  with a tooter, and if we signalled to the plane we would use a ground sheet. The ground sheet is something like a venetian blind and is worked by a spring which turns the slats of the sheet up in either black or white. On keeping the spring taunt the white surface is presented and on loosing the spring the black surface is presented. In this way the sheet can be used to convey Morse code signals.</p>
<p>While at this village I visited another village named Naours, a distance of about 4 miles away. In this village there were some famous caves which were well worth visiting, as they were of historical import owing to the fact that they were excavated to accommodate refugees of one of France's recent wars with Germany.<br/>These caves were excavated in chalky subsoil in the form of a maze of passages with small passages leading off them again into rooms. There were over 300 rooms carved out in this underground place, and there were also two large rooms carved out which were used for the purpose of churches, with the altars and other necessary furniture carved from chalk. In one spot from where several passages radiated there was a chalk pedestal which was about 20 feet in height within the enclosure of a small ornamental fence, and on the pedestal numerous names were scratched; some I recognised as Melbourne citizens who must have been visiting the caves. <br/>A girl who conducted us through the caves by a lighted candle seemed to be the caretaker of the caves, and charged 5 francs for a party of 10 of us. Another way the girl made money was by selling picture postcards of the caves. After we had seen all that was to be seen at the caves, we sauntered to the other end of the village, where we listened to a British Artillery Band for an hour or so, and then went onto our billets, arriving in time for tea in an estaminet.</p>
<p>On the following Sunday I was granted a leave pass to Amiens, and while there I visited the Cathedral while the Church service was in progress.</p>
