sheet of dull glass. Then, as the light became stronger, it became a plain of burnished silver, changing in a moment to all the colours of the rainbow. Suddenly out from the conical peak ashore a great column of fire shot up, and remained hovering over the mountain, as though it was being poured in a fiery stream from its bowels. As the Sun rose higher, the everchanging cloud wavered and broke into a fleecy mass of brilliant colour the ragged edges brilliant in burnished gold and purple. A glorious sight.
The day was quiet and uneventful, we had our first "roll" in the Sea to day, some of our fellows started on 6 meals a day three down and three up.
July 13th
Had to day in Adelaide. Only had four and a half hours leave here Caught the train at outer Harbour, where the Mongolia lay, and went into Adelaide three-quarters of a hours journey in the train. It was the first time I have seen Adelaide and I found it a charming little city, with wide streets, much wider than Melbourne, splendid footpaths, beautiful public buildings, and homely people. With hills at the back, it reminded we somewhat of Ballarat, Vic with old Mt Buni-nyong in the background. At a little after 6 P.M. we set sail for Freemantle, the longest trip on the coast. We took about sixty men aboard here.
