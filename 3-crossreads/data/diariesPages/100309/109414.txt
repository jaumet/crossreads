22/6/17 Beaulencourt
Went to BdeH.Q. at 9.30 and saw the G.O.C. and B.M. about todays wood fighting. The Battalion moved off at 11 a.m. and I went on with the company commanders to reconnoitre. There were several heavy showers. Living so much out of doors as we are lately has given us a ferocious appetite and we can account for good meals. All the cookers were out and we had lunch at noon. At 2 p.m. the coys. went off to their jobs in defence of the wood, holding the fringe in 8 posts of sections with a similar second line covering gaps. Supports and reserves behind. A very pretty spot this and a fine green sward in front of the Chateau which doubtless in its time has seen many gay things ? now in ruins. Sent the coys home independently being fed up of getting wet every night. Wearing the ground sheet capewise saves a lot of wet clothes. Rodd goes on leave tomorrow and Dooley will resume his company command. A fine evening a little cold.
