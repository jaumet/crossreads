<p>Friday 11/5/17.<br/>Well last night was the limit, started off at 10 in the dark, fellows like stuck rabbits thought they hadn't a minute to live so got over the ground  for all they were worth, being all young men, soon left me behind. Shells were bursting on our left all the way. Got to my old stumbling block the Trench which I fell into &amp; safely got over this time but on the other side not a soul was to be seen, so I had to plug along on my own &amp; didn't for the life of me know where I was going or when I would fall into a shell crater, however after much cursing, sweating &amp; yelling to the others I got there at last. I called them all the scared ninnies I could think of</p>
<p>Got our Bags of Rations &amp; a tin of water &amp; off again hadn't gone hundred yards when head over heels I went water one way &amp; Rations another Rifle another &amp; helmet the same. I didn't say anything "Oh no" smiled ever so sweetly &amp; said dear me "I don't think". up again &amp; through the shell zone again arriving safely, Just prior to this 6 of the 53rd were knocked out at the well one killed.</p>
<p>delivered the goods &amp; turned in 12.30 just getting a snooze up when we were called out again to take Rations up to head Quarters  six yds up. did so after some more "dear me's" &amp; then turned in at 2.30. We went over land &amp; not through the Trenches &amp; it was a wonder we were not spotted &amp; shelled. Hadn't been in more than half an hour when Fritz started &amp; didn't he pump shells into this Place, wonderful how any one lives through it</p>
<p>Today fine &amp; hot Planes over us &amp; the air craft guns are going strong. Forgot to</p>
