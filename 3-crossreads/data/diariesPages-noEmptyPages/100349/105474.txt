and mules, all mixed up and piled in heaps. We covered about 8 miles; the track was very bad and a dark night with heavy rain. We suffered no casualties however. Had a clean up there, received some mail, then after a snack, we got on board the motor lorries; which conveyed us back to a new camp near Popperinghe

A muster parade; roll call, etc; otherwise an easy day. Are not expecting to stay here long; we will move either forward or back. So I spent the evening in Popperinghe.
