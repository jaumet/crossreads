<p>74<br/>I go into Hotel de'Angleterre with Young who has left his things there. We then adjourn to club &amp; met McCartney &amp; More. Then visit Braserie de l'Opera &amp; American Bar back in Rue de Charettes. Then Apollo &amp; Hotel de Paris where we left the others &amp; visited Stephanies Rue de Grosse Horloge opp Hotel du Nord &amp; finally after many adventures walk home arriving here about 2.30 am. To day I draw all available cash &amp; by end of night had spent it all.</p>
<p>5-3-19<br/>As very few of the 37 expected have arrived the course is postponed one day to await their probable arrival &amp; Young &amp; I again set off for town. Afternoon tea at Club bring Lt Morton 3rd Bn to me &amp; he joins our company: I meet Gabrielle Petit &amp; then go home to dinner with Morton at his billet.</p>
<p>The old man is very ill. I yarned &amp; he has invited to dine with him. We return to our rendez-vous at 8 pm at St Ouen &amp; then we went to the Apollo a variety theatre with hideous painted actresses who sang English songs in French &amp; throughout the whole performance a modernly dressed man &amp; woman persisted their modern allure contrasting strangely with the costumes say of ancient Egypt in a scene from Cleopatra or the tights of ballet dancers.
