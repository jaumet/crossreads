<p>1915<br/>Aug. 17 Tue.<br/>The Skating Rink &amp; Theatre in the Esbekieh Gardens have been taken over by the Aust. Red Cross &amp; Y.M.C.A. to be run as a Soldiers' Club. I attended the opening of the Club at 6.30. p.m. by General Sir John &amp; Lady Maxwell. Gen. Spens &amp; Gen. Legge also spoke on the object of the opening. There is no doubt that such clubs are very useful.</p>
