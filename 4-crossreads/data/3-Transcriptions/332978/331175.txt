<p>Arthur Dent is here &ndash; a great shock when I first saw him, he was posted as "killed in action". Had long yarn with him &amp; from all accounts he has had a very bad time. His Bn let him down, or sold him a pup, the Stunt he was in.</p>
<p>It is very cold here &amp; <strike>all</strike> I am feeling rather depressed. I have been invited to mess with Gracie &amp; Dalgety &amp; co for the time being. Stones is in another mess, likewise Tremlott.</p>
<p>December 10th<br/>Paraded to Dr &amp; granted permission to be absent from Roll Call. Nothing to do here except walk around &amp; hot air &amp; play cards. Saw Cull &amp; McQuiggan, also met aust flying officer named Norvel. He has lost the use of one arm &ndash;</p>
<p>Played Bridge &ndash;</p>
<p>December 11th<br/>Very cold &ndash; Up early &ndash; today has been an eventful one for me. I with 80 others was examined by a Swiss &amp; German Commission for repatriation. It was not a very thorough exam &ndash; He <strike>read</strike> a German General read my medical History &amp; after a careful perusal of the X ray proof, had a look at my ankle &amp; said that I would go to Switzerland. It was all over in about 5 mins, &amp; just before I left, I was informed that I would be going to Chateau D'eaux &ndash;</p>
<p>The Commission examine the men at Mannheim tomorrow. Several officers have failed to arrive in time for the Commission. Played Bridge &amp; had yarn with Cull.</p>
