along came a Young Lady & a little Girl from the Estaminet & I joined them & we all went back to the Cinema in Rue De Arras, having obtained our Tickets we all went inside & obtained a seat each, the house was almost full, with Civilians, also a large number of Chinese & a fair sprinkling of Soldiers, a good program was provided & a good Music from the Piano, the Pictures started at 4 Pm & we finished at 5.30, starting again at 6 Pm for a second time. When we came outside a large crowd was waiting to go in for the second performance, I continued promenading with my friends & went out to the Young Lady's Home where I was introduced to her People who received me very well. We did not remain there long & soon returned to the Estaminet at 7 Pm where I had some Tea with them & at 9 Pm returned to the Depot,
Monday 1/7/18.I journeyed to Dunkirk for the last time & on Tuesday signed on at 9 am to learn the Road to Bolougne, travelling on the Passenger Train,
