<p>Lt. Col. D. Fulton, Commandant<br/>H.Q., A.I.F., Cairo</p>
<p>I attach hereto inventory of contents of case deposited at Australian Depot Stores, Ghezireh.</p>
<p>I am sending a similar copy to Lieut. Smart, Administration, Australian Commonwealth Offices, London.</p>
<p>The catalogue of Works totalling 117 is evidence that my time has been thoroughly occupied.  My trip to the Front Line which I am now about to undertake should produce another dozen numbers.  I am taking it for granted that my commission will be extended until such time as I arrive in London, and I beg that you will take such necessary steps as will confirm this.  I take it that transportation for myself and my work is now being arranged and that I shall be informed at the earliest opportunity of the date of sailing.</p>
