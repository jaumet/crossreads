 Friday 30 November 
 Showery. One long trip today calling at A.D.M.S. Office Dranoutre then to 15th Field Ambce. and on to the 5th Canadian mob.  Lab at Bailleul &ndash; Thence to 5th Div. Workshops outside of Bailleul where I learned that a new Douglas Cycle is waiting for us.  Returned to Dranoutre, then on to Locre and back to the Main Dressing Station. Guns were active in the evening indicating that a move of some sort was taking place. We later on learned that  a move of  the 3rd Aust. Div. had hopped the bags.
