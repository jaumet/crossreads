100a thing I was very sorry for when I came to the wood. We reached our destination tired out and then ensued the usual hunt for dugouts.
I secured one on top. It was in a reasonable state of repair although there were pools of water laying about on the floor. I set to and tried to get a rest, had as my mates Greenfield, Stevenson and later on "Bluey" Wyer.
Having no blanket I was only able to sit on my tin helmet for the night whilst quartered here. Word was brought to us that a mail was leaving if we desired to send a greeting home for Christmas, we could do so.
There being no paper available all I could send was a greeting on a piece of cardboard.
