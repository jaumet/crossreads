<p>br/>16/8/14<br/>We have just come back to a spot 2000 miles from Sydney, otherwise Port Moresby for coal and oil, after covering 5000 miles since the war opened. I sent a letter off to you which I believe will leave tomorrow. Tho' I cd. give you no information. Yet I hope it gave you some little comfort, But what was my surprise &amp; joy after posting to get from you two letters and a wire; a letter each from Jessie &amp; Lois &amp; a wire from Robinson &amp; Jeanie. I never dreamt of such a thing and to say that I enjoyed them is to put it  very mildly. It certainly never occurred to me that I shd. Ever see Port Moresby, which is very interesting. The Administrator, Staniforth Smith came off accompanied by Beatrice Grimshaw the novelist who shinned up the Jacobs Ladder like any sailor boy. They came in a boat pulled by Papuans, a short, lithe, clean limbed lot, with extraordinary fuzzy-wuzzy heads of hair. I cannot get ashore but thro' a glass can make out the details of their houses. These are most extraordinary, being built on piles on the sea; they are certainly picturesque. But we have other things to think of. The "Koolonga" is waiting for us with  coal and the Telena with oil. Alas &amp; alas it is Australian coal. When will these blighters realise that it may have to be paid for in blood. It is the most awful stuff imaginable &amp; we are in a most awful tear about it. If we were really up against anything serious it wd. just make the difference between victory and defeat. No chance for a service today. This is the third Sunday we have been done out of it, &amp; it is quite possible that we shall be coaling next Sunday. I am not assisting; there are plenty of men and to spare. The sun is hot, but there is a pleasant breeze. I can't say I think much of this part of New Guinea; the hills are steep &amp; mainly barren; the little town reminds me strongly of Queenstown in Tasmania. I understand there are about 300 white people here. At eight p.m. we finish &amp; officers &amp; men enjoy a well earned rest. The Encounter is patrolling outside &amp; we need not fear. For the first time since we left Sydney the ship is alight from</p>
