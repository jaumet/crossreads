about 18 in. long & on the end of the "nulla" they have a steel head shaped liked a cog-wheel something, one crack from that will settle any man, exactly to the second on 10 oclock our guns opened & the raiders crawled out to the German wire & laid there & waited for the fire to lift, but so anxious were they that they were in the trenches while our guns were pounding them, we all waited anxiously to hear how they were getting on, at last came a wounded man, & shortly after the whole lot came in as cool as you like, they raided the trenches for a distance of a couple of hundred yards long, killed about 20 men, they bayonetted 7 of them, & got one prisoner that was all they wanted
