They also took away a sample of the discharge, so I'm tipping the next thing will be another operation.  Put in a good day at my Cushion Cover.  Got Letter from Mary B.  Wrote to  Mother.

Received Box of Cigarettes & Letter from Bacup  Got up after dinner & went down the villages on crutches.  Plenty of visitors flying about & a convoy of patients arrived.
