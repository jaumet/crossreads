2/1/19 Gourdinne
The Battalion is getting ridiculous now and we only have 450 here. This morning turned out all available men and then went out and watched them do some drill. Afterwards inspected the Lewis gunners under Little Turner and found all their guns and parts in very fair order. Afternoon there was a football match between two companies. A raw cold afternoon with good visibility and looking down the long valley running down from Thy le Chateau to Laneffe one could see spires of numerous little villages clustering. General Birdwood is going to inspect the Battalion at Nallines tomorrow so there is much heartsearching on the manpower question.
