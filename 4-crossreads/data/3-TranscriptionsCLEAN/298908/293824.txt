I imagined by some foolish means that she was sarcastic over it & I wrote a pretty sharp letter to her in return.  The day after I posted it I was sorry but the deed was done & I could only pray to Heaven that she would never get it, but no good it arrived alright & today I got her letter saying how sorry she was.  I'll bet she was no more miserable over it than I, so I sat down & wrote her a letter telling how sorry I was & that I never ceased regretting such a rotten action & I won't feel satisfied till a couple of months are up & she will have it. It was announced on parade this morning that 2 of our mates have unfortunately died with the "flu" in Devonport Hospital & No. 4 Coy. were detailed to attend their funeral.  I think this is a very sad thing its hard luck for the chaps but in one way worse for their people.
