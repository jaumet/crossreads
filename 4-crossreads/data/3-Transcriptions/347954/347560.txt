<p>roof &amp; I must confess straightaway that they completely mystified me.  I imagined they were in some way connected with burnt offerings not being familiar with the Koran, but was greatly relieved when I was told they were for lamp hanging only.  Really I thought I was on the borderland of mystery.  Nearby is another mosque, the new one, built by the late Khedive.  It is similiar in design only more gorgeous.  With an Arabian friend I visited the private mosque of the Sultan on Xmas day '14.  It is much smaller but lacks none of the grandeur of the other ones I had visited.  The real big thing in mosques though is the one situated near the Citadel.  Here you see enormous slabs of alabaster in the making &amp; beauty combined with grandeur goes towards making this one of the sights really worth visiting in this city of sights.  The fittings are similiar as in other mosques but on entry here you are provided with over shoes which must be worn before you can cross the threshold.  Earlier days you were compelled to remove your boots before entering.  A very nice sample of mosques is now being erected on the road to Ghizeh.  It will be on completion very grand &amp; should attract many visitors from town.</p>
