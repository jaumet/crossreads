 they would even assume the importance that has been thrust upon them 
 during the past 18 months.  French youngsters shout as the train goes 
 by for "souvenir", "Souvenir", our badges and buttons being especiall 
 sought after.  Our lads soon ran out of these and in looking round 
 for something to give away one genius thought of the hard issue bis- 
 cuits.  These were autographed and donated in large numbers.  They 
 formed excellent souvenirs as you can write quite well on them with 
 an indelible pencil or fountain pen, and of course it is impossible 
 to break them except with an axe.  I have heard it said that if you 
 soak them in water for a couple of days, you are able to break them 
 with your hands but I have never seen it done.  If any particularly

 a shouwer of biscuits thrown at her, and beyond a few chips out of 
 them (the biscuits, not the girls)  I dont think I ever saw one 
 break despite the fact that they often landed up against stone walls 
 railings, etc.  As the men have plenty of money they buy bread and 
 won't eat the biscuits and it's very funny to see the uses they make 
 of the latter.  In muddy weather they make little paths up to their 
 tents with them, also door mats to wipe your feet on whilst many an 
 ornamental garden round about the camps is bordered by biscuits much 
 the same way as some people delight in using bottles.
