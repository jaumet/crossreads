<p>25th The bombardment continued all night &amp; never let up as yet, I had a terrible narrow shave &amp; shock early this morning, myself &amp; Bob Creasy were lying in 2 dugouts almost touching one another I was almost asleap, &amp; was dreaming of home, when all of a sudden a terrific roar &amp; I found myself all dazed lying in the trench a shell had exploded without a lie not 5 ft from my head but just above it, it wounded poor Bob Creasy I bandaged him up he was hit in the head, chest, &amp; nose I think he will get over it alright.</p>
<p>I think the shelling is even worse today than yesterday</p>
