 Awaiting Repatriation 
 My Dear People, 
    A dull day, the wind blowing freshly, but thank goodness, no rain! 
    The morning had been spent on indoor work, a kit check, and I had had no exercise, neither had the horse, so at three o'clock I had Annie (the mare) sent up to the Mess and mounting, made for the high plains for our village and in fact every village hereabouts is nestled in a valley, out of the biting wind.  This wind was stirring on the high ground, and after a canter cross-country and a trot for three kilos I was glad when the road turned down into a valley with its invariable dirty little village.  Here I saw the quaintest and poorest church that I have ever seen, wattle and daub for hte most part, and relieved by tiles which however in some places, had dropped off.  The weathercock surmounting the gable hung awry and the metal crucifix in front of the Church was at a drunken angle. 
    Today was not suitable to photography so I had not taken a camera, but I mean t  to take a run over on the first fine day and secure a photograph to send you. 
    The magnificence or otherwise of a church building and the many roadside cricifixes is a sure index to the wealth or poverty of a village, and here I found "Like xxx Church Like Village" for the homes were all poor.
