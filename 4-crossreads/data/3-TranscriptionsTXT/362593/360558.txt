Struck a Hun two-seater over Jericho, we chased him going full out almost to Jenin over 40 miles.  As we could not catch him opened fire at 250 yards firing over top plane.  Hun turned and attempted to beat us off.  Fired good burst at 150 yards.  Hun hit many times for certain.  As ammunition now all used we break off fight and do our photos successfully.
