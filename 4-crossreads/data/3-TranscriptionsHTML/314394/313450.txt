<p>August continued. I found the electric light full on in the wheel house and reported it to the Captain of the ship. Soon the guns could be heard in the distance and in a short time rifle fire, the flashes could be observed on the hills, there appeared to be a fight on. Shortly afterwards bullets began to fall on the deck, and a Greek standing on the bridge was hit in the stomach. A hospital ship loomed up and we anchored near to one of them and prepared to disembark. As usual everything was in a mess, no method and everyone in charge. The reserve of ammunition, medical stores, tools and etc had to be got off and it was found very difficult on the crowded ship and narrow passages on to the barges. A landing officer through his megaphone made a few attempts to prevent so much talking and to hurry us up with Will the officers in charge, kindly hurry them up"."Pack up close" His English affected speech rather annoyed the Aussies. At last we came to a small low wharf at Anzac, and after some difficulty landed. The sea was a little rough and it was no easy matter to jump on to the wharf with full pack, 200 rounds of ammunition, and two days rations. On getting to the beach we made a rather uncertain march along the beach to a Gully which we afterwards found was called Rest Gully. It was a very hard pull up as it was very rough and steep. As soon as we were given the order to halt we lay down exhausted and attempted to go to sleep for a few hours till morning, it was then about 3 of the clock. Major JENKINS was in command of the Battalion as Colonel was taken ill and remained behind in hospital. At daybreak most of us got up and had a look round, some tea and bully beef and biscuits.</p>
