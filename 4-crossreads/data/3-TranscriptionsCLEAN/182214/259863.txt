  
 Lyons is another big city & rather pretty but we did not stay there, but a place just outside for tea & rations From Lyons the weather was not too warm & the further North we went the colder it got. here we saw our first hospital train going south & we felt sorry to the wounded who seemed cheerful enough & waved their hands to us, the French red cross gave us bread & cakes & would take no money for same but pointed to the red cross collection boxes & the boys put in fair contributions The scenery from here to the outskirts of Paris was still very lovely & we passed a large estate where the people came out for the day from Paris as they seemed Holiday making they waved & the children cheered.
