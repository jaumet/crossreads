<p>Oct <strike>19th</strike> 20 Dartford<br/>Yesterday was a lovely day. After tea went into Dartford, after a while went into the pictures, but discovered that it was the same lot that I had seen before there.</p>
<p>No 3 Auxillery Hosp. Dartford<br/>Tuesday Oct. 22nd 18<br/>Lovely day, not cold. Yesterday afternoon I went to London, to the performance at Her Majesty's, for Australians.<br/>We saw the Revue, 'Choo Chin Chow' &amp; it was very fine.<br/>In the interval after the second act, Sir Peter McBride, Agent Gen. to Victoria spoke a few words, said that Australians had done  <strike>every thing that</strike> as good as he could wish them to have done, &amp; asked us to give three cheers for Mr Oscar Asche who gave the performance. We had a cup of tea passed round &amp; on leaving were all given a packet of cigarettes with Mr Asche's compliments. This afternoon am going to see The Bing Boys of Broadway.</p>
<p>Oct 26- 18<br/>The Bing Boys turned out to be a picture show instead, so I did not go in, had a bus ride out somewhere &amp; back in the tube</p>
