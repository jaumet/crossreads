 Have made a seperate dugout for ourselves. Mac, I & Bernie Norris. Mac is pretty crook in the stomach but seems to be improvong. The 21 st  Batt relieved the 24 th . They are very raw men & allowed a Turk to get into our trenches early in the Morning. 
 21 st  Batt were torpedoed outside Lemnos & lost the Brigadier & about 40 men.
