<p>After being on Duty a day &amp; a half I was disgusted to find myself down with Enteritis &amp; have since been in the Sick Sisters Hospital- however today I am feeling almost myself again.  This climate is very trying for new comers.  The majority fall sick.  I think it must be due to the dreadful heat, combined with the Egyptian food.  Matron only gave me light duties too- the Specialling of two Spinal cases- the sadness attached to them I won't detail.  Captain Wright &amp; Captain Hume.  The latter is a friend of Sir Henry Galway &amp; he said he was going to write to him to tell him how he was nursed by a S.A.n nurse.  I was indeed sorry for other hands to take them on- jealous I mean.  Yesterday Sister Campbell came to see me- how pleased we were to see each other again.  She &amp; I became great friends at the Queens Home.  Today she came again &amp; Sister Haynes too.  They are down for a weeks well earned rest from Cairo.</p>

<p>Over a month and not a line in my diary, but I have contrived to send you all a personal remembrance  I'm quite learning the art of patience in receiving letters &amp; now watch for those written in August before those of June.  It's lovely getting letters &amp; papers it makes you feel that Australia is not so isolated after all I am still at the Deaconesses Hospital</p>
