  
 Friday 1st  Aug  Sept 1916 Dad arrived on Friday last to my great pleasure, & after we had had a good yarn, & he had made himself friendly with the W.O. Maxwell (temp while Pollard was away) he managed to get me leave till the Monday night All my hopes since enlisting were thus satisfied, & in just the way I had hoped. Lily has grown a nice young lady now, & it was a delight to see her again after my long absence.  She was tremendously excited but not more than I.
