blade for a curved bootmakers spokeshave.I have had griping pain all today & this evening.  I took a dose of salts this morning but felt very little better.I received two letters from my wife this evening dated June 27&28 and No 74 and 73.  She had received 5 letters & 2 P.C. that week- a feast of mails x C.P.&T.B. & the Miller girls, & I. Ring also received P.C.I was issued with a new pair of brown Australian boots today size 8.4.  I needed them very badly as the ones I was wearing were leaking & I was wet footed every wet day.  I had them since last January.  The Aust. boots are far superior to the English boots.  There is better material in them&they are better made & better shape.There is to be an inspection of the whole Battalion transports included next Tuesday and during the past week we have been busy making preperations for it, getting our equipment clean and 8 [indecipherable] made good.
Saturday Sept 1. 1917. (1125.)This is the 9th month of the year, the war is not finished but the end is in sight, and I believe that about the end of October will see the end of it.  If it does not end about then it will probably go another winter, which neither side wants, least of all the enemy.  The recent Italian Brilliant series of success bring the end appreciably nearer and has a marked effect on the conduct of the war throughout.I received another letter from my wife dated Jan 31. No 48.  One of the first written from Merrigum & describing the trip up & the stay at Seymour.  It had been through the various hospitals & eventually sent back to the Battalion. I wrote to Cis this evening.
