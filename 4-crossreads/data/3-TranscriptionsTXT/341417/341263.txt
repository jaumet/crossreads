 Articles contributed to augment those used &amp; supplied by the Govrmt. This section would include, sandbags, bandages &amp; dressings, first field dressings, socks, Balaclava caps, mittens etc. crutches, splints, Invalids clothing. 
 All these should be delivered to &amp; only handled by the Army Ordnance Dept. Even though sandbags can be made cheaply in India from jute on the spot I consider all used commercial sacks should be made up into sandbags. If new hessian is used I would think that after duty, freight etc. is paid on it, that the Goverment could manage better, by getting them made in India by machines,  cheaper .  Labour is cheaper there too. 
 Now as regards knitted work.  Men are supplied with caps &amp; socks by the Ordnance Dept. on a regular scale. If they have just had socks from issue &amp; a comforts lot arrives    will  men will waste them when they are plentiful as you know. The Dept. could use all knitted work by issuing it, where a check is kept on a man's kit.
