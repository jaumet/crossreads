<p>Feb 29th. Tues.<br/>Special parade this afternoon when we were marched off to have a fresh water bath. This is the most sensible thing that has been done in our unit for some time, although we were all very much amused at it.</p>
<p>Under the supervision of an Officer we were each allowed to draw a basin of water, about a couple of pints. In this we had to wash ourselves. Then after having a bath we were allowed to draw another basin of water to wash one shirt. This was'nt much to look at but it was indeed a real pleasure to us all.</p>
<p>The other three senior men who were put under arrest have been acquitted. As they returned back to camp they were greeted with great cheers by the men.</p>
<p>March 1st Wednesday.</p>
<p>The occupants of our tent were paraded to-day before the O.C. and were asked a few questions regarding the counting out of the Officer, Major Jolly.</p>
<p>The questions put to us were :-</p>
<p>No 1 "Did you hear any talking after Lights Out"</p>
<p>No 2 "Were there any talking in your tent after Lights Out?"</p>
<p>No 3. "Did you hear Sgt Guest say that parade the next day would be at 6 o'clock instead of 6.45?"</p>
<p>No 4. "Did you hear any counting Out?"</p>
<p>No 5. Did you hear anyone say "Now all to-gether boys"?</p>
<p>No 6 "Did anyone do any counting Out in your tent?"</p>
