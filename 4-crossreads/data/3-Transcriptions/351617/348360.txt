<p>The next night I took on Runner from platoon H.Q. to Company HQ at Millers Daughter Dugouts about &frac12; miles from the Line, but the night was very quiet except when a stray Machine Gun would open out 3 or 4 shots &amp; then close up again.</p>
<p>The third night in I was put on patrol across 200 yds of open space that Devided D Coy from C Coy. This was no sweet Job as every now and then Fritz would send over Star Shells &amp; Flares, that lit up the country for miles &amp; the only thing to do was stand as still as possible with your head bent, so the light would not light up your face there were only 2 of us on this &amp; we carried Rifle with the Bayonet sticking in the Sling swivels so we could fix it at a seconds notice, &amp; 2 mills Grenades in our pockets ready for a dust up.</p>
<p>Everything is as silent as death except our own footsteps in the soft snow</p>
