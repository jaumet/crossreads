<p>1918<br/>Tue 2nd Apl.<br/>Dreary, basalt-coloured towns whisked past, varied by very new red-brick farmhouses and, strange to say, not a single specimen of the famous Holstein breed of dairy cattle was to be seen during the entire journey.</p>
<p>We arrived at Hamburg at 5.30 pm;  sharing our compartment en route with two really pretty and quite chic (<u>and</u> affable) girls, a dashing widow, a worried-looking haus-frau, and two unter-offiziers.</p>
<p>I treated my unter offizier to dinner in the 1st Class Restaurant of the big station at about 6.30p.    the large hall was crowded, chiefly with officers and their women-folk;   &amp; the entrance of the Englander again created quite a thrill.</p>
<p>We occupied a table right in the centre of the room, and I proceeded to cause an absolute sensation.</p>
