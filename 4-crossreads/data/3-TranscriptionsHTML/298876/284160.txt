<p>Charley Chaplin's night out, they go mad over Charley Chaplin here, the pictures are shown in French &amp; alongside on a screen is the translation of English.</p>
<p>The authoritys are making Artillery units out of Light Horsemen, there are more rumours about this body than any other. They are still hanging on to us L.H.F.A. as a body. Heard a good yarn told by an English Captain at an impromptu Concert last night &ndash; this Captain in Cairo one evening was greatly annoyed at not being saluted by Australians &ndash; so much so that he pulled up one to make an example of him &ndash; Thus &ndash; Hi you man do you know that I am a Captain &ndash; Lor' Lumme, just fancy, how are ye &ndash; why I'm only a blankey private. The same officer said he hoped we would'nt mind him trying to tell Australians yarns as they had told him some good ones.</p>
<p>Had a ride on a donkey, altho we were digging our spurs in they responded better to the niggers few words of encouragement</p>
