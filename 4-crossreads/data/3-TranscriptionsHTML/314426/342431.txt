<p>20/1/19<br/>The papers to day announce the death of Prince John the King's youngest son at Sandringham on Saturday night at the age of 13. and a few months. The newspapers express the nation's sympathy with the King &amp; Queen.<br/>Tuesday Jan 21. 1919. (72)<br/>Dull &amp; cloudy but no rain.<br/>I wrote to Lizzie this morning letter 154.<br/>This afternoon I had a look through the brick works at Chicherell. I watched the operations from when the clay is shovelled into the crusher where it is ground into coarse powder and elevated to a loft, where it is fed into a machine mixed with water and carried on to another machine which presses it and feeds it into moulds where it is again pressed with a pressure equal to 10 tons. These moulds arranged in a circle on a revolving table are then automatically [indecipherable]. This machine with a full gang of men is capable of making 1,300 bricks an hour. A 75 H.P. suction gas ingine drives the machinery. The bricks are wheeled to a shed for drying. The kill for burning the bricks is on the Hotman principle</p>
