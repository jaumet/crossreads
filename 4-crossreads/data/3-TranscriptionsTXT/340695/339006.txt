Mack &amp;amp' I went to see my friend Lydre at Reninghelst to-night &amp; received a great welcome. We helped her milk the cows (4) Mack milked one &amp; I held the candle &amp; laughed. There was Mack with his hat on &amp; gas helmet across his shoulders &amp; full uniform with a bucket between his knees working hard &amp; Lydie breaking all records next to him it was a funny picture. It was quite dark &amp; the perfume was none too pleasant. A glass of milk was handed round &amp; afterwards a cup of coffee. 30-9-17. Great excitement last night
