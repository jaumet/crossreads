 5 I think Monday 31st July 1916. 
 Dear Father &amp; Mother/. I am still in the same place and have not seen any fighting yet. I am having a great time here and spend most of my time skating around the neighbourhood looking for views &amp; places of interest to photograph. There are a number of Australians camped at this place, including a couple of Battalions from Ennogera comprising Northern Rivers boys. The 41st. &amp; 42nd. Battalions are chiefly made up of these. Freddie Board is also over here in charge of a Battalion as Lieut.-Colonel, also Aleck Kemp &amp; Stratford out of Lance's. I met and had a yarn to the latter two. Tell Mrs. Kemp that Aleck is looking splendid. Their transport had a very bad trip over. The engines broke down twice, once when they were in the most dangerous area, about 100 miles from England, and they drifted for three days at the mercy of any submarines which might happen along. I am enclosing a number of photos which I took around the neighbourhood. I must now close in order to catch the mail. I have as yet received only one letter from home and one from Uncle Vesey, which reach me alright although addressed to Melbourne, and from there to France. I know you are writing each week and have no doubt I will receive a pile ere this reaches you. Must now close in order to catch the mail. With love to all Your loving son, Eugene.
