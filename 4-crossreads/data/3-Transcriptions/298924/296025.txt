<p>Wednesday 12 February 1919<br/>Divisional Field Officer.  Whole topic of conversation among the men is "What they will say to the Officers in 6 weeks time &ndash; far worse than ever it was after S. Africa, simply a kind of "Bolshie" business.<br/>Gertie, a little cob I was riding, was shot this morning among 100 others &ndash; being over 8 yrs.<br/>Anonymous letters to Officers as to what will be published in the Papers "when the Regt. gets home".  Officers have been allowed to buy their saddles, the men NOT.  That is another source of imaginary grievance.</p>
