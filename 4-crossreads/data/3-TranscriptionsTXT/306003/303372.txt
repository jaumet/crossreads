31-5-16slept well despite the fact that we had no overcoats with us & the night was cool;  We were called at 12.45 & were soon on the track again, about 4 oclock to camped in a another clump of palms where the New Zealanders camped last night, & had no trouble in getting a good supply of brackish water by digging two or 3 feet in the sand, one of these wells has very fresh water compared to the others & quite good for drinking.  from the ridges above the camp we could hear a little rifle fire just at sunrise & a little a few shots were fired by artillery (probably Turkish)
The New Zealanders are in advance of us & we are only 8 miles from the Turkish Head Quarters;  Bde Head Quarters are also here with us today & a wireless station is erected on the ridge above us;  this trip has been a very decent picnic up to date;  The 2nd & 3rd Regts left Romani at 9 oclock last night & arrived here at Biril Abd about 7 oclock this morning & got word soon after to go
