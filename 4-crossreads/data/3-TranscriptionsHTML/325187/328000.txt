<p>With Dorothy.  Rang up Sir George Reid, Lady Reid asked me to dinner but I'm not going anywhere at night at all.  Just going along quietly.<br/>Not much sunshine &amp; the days are short.<br/>I will send you a Cable if &amp; when I get married.<br/>What a heap of letters must be following me up when they do come, I'll have quite an interesting day reading them all.</p>
