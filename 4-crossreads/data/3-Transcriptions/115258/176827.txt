<p>This barracks is a great place, next best place to getting home - it is a beautiful building . We have a big rom to seven of us (all mates) - one of the chaps got a concerteena by the post, and <s>wh</s> we had a dance, and we have had a pay and letter &amp; parcel mail, and I have never seen the chaps so absolutely happy before. We had bacon and eggs to day - eggs five pence each but they are worth it for a treat, and such pretty Christian girls bring them here to sell - it makes a person feel quite home sick Mother. Oh! I received a cheque for 20 pound from the Cairo gift stores, so suppose you sent it to me. I am paying it into my paybook, then I can draw it when ever I get leave. I am very glad you sent it as a couple of days ago I broke the ivory from one of my pivot teeth. Cpl Edwards broke his some time ago &amp; got it fixed in Port Said for 2 pound so I&#39;ll have a shot at it too - broke the tooth eating an army biscuit but the dentist here will only fill, or make false sets so is not in my line. I&#39;ll try and write again in a day ot two if I get some time Mother! Have just had a hot bath and am going to turn in. Feel OK. Love to Father and the boys. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson</p>
