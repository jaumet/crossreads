 Field 10 October 
 Dear Mrs. John, 
 So sorry that you didn't get a letter by last mail &amp; I can't understand it as I have written at least once a week for ages.  Any how the mails are perfectly mad.  I get letters anyhow, I got 24 (how they are mounting up, my gracious you'll be getting considered rapid, 24 letters to  one  man alone in six months).  Anyhow I mean to say I got No. 24 &amp; 21 together than 23 floated along &amp; then 22 &amp; 25 together.  So if my comments &amp;c. are a bit disjointed
