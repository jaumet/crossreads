29th. Fatigue as per usual a nice distance we had to walk took us an hour a half to get to our job which was cleaning up an old road on Messines Ridge, wasn't it hard for it was frozen like steel the weather was icy cold we were all practically knocked out by the time we lobbed home again I cut my finger badly on this job with a piece of barb-wire it bled very freely, on our way home a Gotha nearly sat on top of us so low did he come must have lost his way for there was a heavy mist hanging about he was too low for the guns to shoot at, but the machine gunners gave him a lively time, but in spite of it all he got safely away
