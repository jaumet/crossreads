then visited all the Wards & wished the men The Season's Greetings.We got to our Lunch about 2. p.m. The orderlies also had a late luncheon but they all worked splendidly & gave the patients a happy time. We hurried back & fixed up things for their tea - all sorts of jellies, custards, cream & biscuits. The patients had an early tea & a cheery time. The Orderlies had a great dinner at 5.30. p.m. It was a merry sight. Their dinner was over at 6. 30. p.m., then they cleared the room & began an excellent Concert which lasted till about mid-night. The Convalescent Patients of course were in it all.
