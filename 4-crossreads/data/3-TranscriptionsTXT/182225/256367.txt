SEPT.   TUESDAY 5   1916
Fine & the Sun shining most of the day, but it has not any power behind it. Out signalling all day with the signalling school & we had a lamp parade at night. I got two letters from Linda, one from Eileen & one from Mrs LLoyd. Linda's letters make all the difference in the world to me here; things can be looking as black as anything & a letter from her seems to make all sunshine again.
