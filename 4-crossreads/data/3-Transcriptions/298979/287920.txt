<p>Sentry. However after a dreary walk across muddy fields the road to the support line was "picked up" &amp; the men were soon amongst the remaining men of the Company.</p>
<p>Clusters formed round each man to obtain the very latest news &amp; enquiries made for men reported missing.</p>
<p>Discussing possibilities &amp; the detail of each known wounded man time passed so quickly that it was almost morning before sleep was possible.</p>
<p>Having no officers in charge the men would have to wait at this old broken down Hun trench till orders were received.</p>
<p>As the weather was very bleak &amp; cold the next day was spent in trying to improve the little muddy shelter &amp; while this work was going on an additional lot of about 30 men arrived. Having been considered missing they received a hearty welcome &amp; great was the rejoicing at the re-union.</p>
<p>The most of these men had been mixed up with other Companies &amp; had stayed with them till relieved.</p>
<p>Turning to the Sentry two of the newcomers said What! You here!</p>
<p>One man then said Why! It was reported to us that you had "gone down" in the charge! The other said, We heard you had been shot in the foot &amp; were off to Blighty again!</p>
<p>The Sentry explained that he supposed the report that he had been "knocked" in the charge arose from the fact that a tripping wire in front of the sunken road had caused him to fall very heavily &amp; very suddenly to the ground, during the charge but he was able to resume his place in the rank at once.</p>
<p>During the process of improving the shelter several, to the onlookers, amusing incidents occurred. Owing to the shelters being dug into a sloping hill the snow &amp; rain had so soaked the ground that several miniature "land slides" took place covering the occupants, but not deeply, with beautiful wet mud &amp; in one case a temporary roof of Sheet Iron &amp; old blankets collapsed, covering four men</p>
