 Tuesday 16 January 1917 [1918] Off 2-5 &amp; went town 4 p.m. tea &amp; S. Cambridge. Now letters are arriving, got 7 in 2 days, some written 11th Dec. '17, reached me 14th 1.'18.  Edith writes from Blue Mts. Spence thanks me for sox &amp; says have been good sending them always. S. Cambridge is interesting &ndash; was a German prisoner for some months &amp; worked under Miss Cavell before her execution.  She, Miss C., was shot 6 a.m. &amp; Miss Cambridge had been visiting her in an unobtrusive way, for some time previously.  Miss Cavell had really saved hundreds of the boys &amp; to see them begging in the streets for bread, was she says, a most pathetic sight.  We garry home through a glorious afternoon &amp; hear this sad story of a good woman.
