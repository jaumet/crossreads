<p>girls who keep house for their brother, he is a doctor, &amp;  is away most of the time. I am very comfortably situated, have a fine big room, lovely bed with eiderdown quilts etc, and half a dozen wardrobes &amp; full size mirrors, almost like living in a grand hotel. I get all of this for a franc. = 10d a day, which is paid by the military as a billet allowance for officers. We lead a very lazy life here now. Now that the war is over the Australian soldier has very little to do, all we do is to play games, &amp; pass the time away in sports, but the time drags when there is nothing to do. The city of Brussels is only a couple of hours journy, and Mons and Namur are even closer, I have been to see the famous Mons, but have not been to Brussels yet. We have a good deal of spare time now to travel around.</p>
