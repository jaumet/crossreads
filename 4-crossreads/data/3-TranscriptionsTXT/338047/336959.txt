1919Marchappeared we had danced the ceiling down on top of the wits below, & they were rather annoyed.  We had to suspend the remaining dances of our ball.I wrote to Mr Brackpool for my camera & received it while here. (The war being now over, we were allowed to use them in France)  Faddy & I had a lot of spare time on our hands at night while in the orderly room & use to spend it playing chess.  Faddy's father had been a champion & had taught him a lot.  I became fairly good at the game.  Emilie & Reine became greatly interested in it & wanted to know how it worked.  Faddy could not explain, so I did.  The King & Queen were of course le roi & la reine - the Castles - Chateaux, knights, cavaliers - bishops, - cures, & the pawns, - les soldats.  They soon saw the idea of the thing & would follow up the game with interest occasionally pointing out where I had made a mistake.  At 9 pm we used to shut up the orderly room & go to their living room.
