<p>God ever made. The best of the Hun Regiments fall like wheat when our chaps go over the top. I am out of the line at present &amp; we are all looking forward to a big spell. We are not in the line at present because our Chaps are advancing all along the line. I am looking forward to the Hun sending out a big peace offensive soon because next year he will have "Buckleys" chance. There are Americans here all over the place &amp; they are a fine body of men.<br/>Things are a lot different to when you were here it is not so hard as everything is perfection. We will win yet Hal old Boy so cheer up &amp; look forward to seeing my handsome dial before very many months have passed. Since Jack came</p>
