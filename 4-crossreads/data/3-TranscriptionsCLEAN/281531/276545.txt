Edinburgh18/7/18and then walked down to the North British Hotel where we lunched and yarned until well after noon. Just here at the top of some steps coming up from the Waverly station is surely the most windy place in Edinburgh and all passersby have to here keep a hold on their hats. Went back to Abercromby Place and a young middy from the "Lion" was in. we had much talk about the Navy and had afternoon tea. Talked until dinner and after that had some music and spent an enjoyable evening in a home circle which is a rare pleasure to one after being so long away out away from all these things. It was still quite daylight at 10.30 pm when we went to bed.
