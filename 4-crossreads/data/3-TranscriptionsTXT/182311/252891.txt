 Janie Nash, he is hoping for leave shortly &amp; will he says visit Plymouth, where I&#39;m sure will have the very best of times.&nbsp; I always do. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The Bn is still in the _________ (underground) but my cold was bothering the  major  Major, who is at present acting C.O. &amp; as I was losing my voice he sent me down to the horse lines until I go off to the Tommies, three days holiday he told me, no orders &amp; no responsibilities. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Major Hurry is one of the most considerate men alive, he is very hardworking &amp; brave too  t he delights to share the boy&#39;s perils &amp; the boys realize this &amp; call him &quot;The Old  Prince &quot;.

 &nbsp;&nbsp; Best Love, Harold.
