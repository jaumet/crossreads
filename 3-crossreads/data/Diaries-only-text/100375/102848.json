our room
We are doing about half an hours fatigue work in the morning and then we are free for the day.Late in the afternoon a large number of troops entered the village. At first one thought that they had come to form the next train load but we learned from them that they were going up to re-inforce the battalions. They were soldiers who had been down at the Base Hospital sick or wounded and had recovered and were going back to the "Line" again They looked a fine set of men.
Germen notices are fixed up on houses all over the village and this points to the place being held and occupied by the Germens. These names have now been scored out and notices printed in English have taken their place.
Many graves are to be seen around here in the fields. They are mostly individual graves The French peoples graveyard has suffered badly in these troublous time. Walking through the graveyard one found beautiful headstones totally destroyed and the graves opened up by the explosion of shells. Even the dead have been disturbed in their resting places in time of war.
To-night is quiet and peaceful the quiet only being broken
