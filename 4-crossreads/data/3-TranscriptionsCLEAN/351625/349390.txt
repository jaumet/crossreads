  
 some months yet for which I am very sorry, he is at present in Scotland on another 17 days leave, he is getting his commission early next year.  I believe his pay has already started which I am very glad as it costs him a lot more than his private's pay.  I had my photo taken in Oxford when on my 14 days leave, they were not too bad but I wont send you one but will bring myself home
