At 10 oclock (PM) the loud bomb explosions began to reverberate through our lines  &  on standing to we perceived the    uneven  space dividing our trenches from the Germans was left as bright as day by flares while machine guns rattled  &  rifles cracked  &  bombs crashed intermittently. It was our bombardment keeping the German sentries awake. Looking  over the parapet we saw on the German front for about 100 yards a dense cloud of fumes  &  dust rising in the light of the flares. As each new bomb burnt a fountain of earth  &  parapet flew upwards  &  the Germans failing to root out their tormentors by means of machine gun  &  rifle fire sent their red  &  green flares streaming skywards as an appeal for artillery aid. It came in the shape of shrapnel which gave our lines a good peppering  &  with a final salvo from our howitzers, the night resumed its normal conditions.
