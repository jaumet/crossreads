  
 everyone wants to be fit & hearty so as to resist fever he's put on half rations - Ye administrative blighters!!! I've got hold of a nice little case holding 5 Mauser bullets - sharp pointed - loot of course & I trust to get hold of a Mauser rifle - DV=shortly Hurrah-Hurrah -We've kicked the cook out & made him a 2nd class stoker - We had him up on the quarter deck repeatedly & complained -  to-day he got disrated & put in the Stoke hole - I've suggested putting him in the fiery furnace like the Hebrew youths & see if his Cooking God could save him - We've suffered under that infernal scoundrel from Dec 7 to Jan 18 - The language he's caused!! I've heard every man in the ward room & the stewards in the pantry all cursing him at once & language in the navy is not the mild stuff you hear ashore - Mr Bumpus is very quiet but when he's finished you may reckon not only the culprit but his family is ended -
