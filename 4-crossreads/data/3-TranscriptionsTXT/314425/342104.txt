A fine day but cloudy. We have about a mile to ride every morning taking the mules and horses to water at a trouch in the village of Daours.There was an inspection of the Transports today in drill order. These inspections will be every week in future until further orders.This afternoon I saw the enemy shoot down one of our baloons in flames by one of his planes. I brazed 8 serviette rings made out of copper driving bands for some of the Transports. Late this evening some
of the Battalion officers put together a German machine gun and fired a large number of rounds into a trench. The cartridges kept jamming because the web belt was defective.I received a tin of Havelock tobacco from my sister.
