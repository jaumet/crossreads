 the elements anywhere:  bleak, bitter are the climatic conditions.  Rain continues to threaten &amp; the office is deluged with huge dust clouds that renders work nigh impossible.  All have begun to assault their great coats, &amp; continued physical exercise of some description or other is required to keep one's self warm.  Altogether I feel splendid &amp; the change from exasperating heat to bitter cold seems to have favoured my physique.
