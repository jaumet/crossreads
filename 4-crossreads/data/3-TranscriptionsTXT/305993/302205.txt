as war was still on & that Peace had not been signed & that everything in general was out of question re Pre war conditions.  The Captain of the transport was notified by the Naval People & also the P&O office that they were satisfied that everything reasonable under the prevailing conditions was done and that there was no need for any complaints for any persons who realized that war had existed & of the misery it had caused in Europe & of the thousands of ships that had been sunk by submarines.  At 9 a.m. left the ship on leave & called at Saulisbury [?Salisbury] House Naval Transport Headquarters & obtained a free 1st class pass to travel by rail to the West of Wales & return.  At 3 p.m. left London for Swansea to see my relatives for the 1st time having been away from England for over 14 years.
Called at several places in Wales, Swansea, Cardiff, Llanelly, Newport, the coalfield towns & also the seaside resort New Quay & had a splendid reception from all my old schoolpals & relatives.  Away for 5 weeks & came to London for a day to find out the movement of the Transport.  Obtained a another 1st Class pass to Wales from the Naval House & returned to the transport.
Tuesday, July 8.I found my mother & all the relatives, brothers & sisters in splendid health.  I had altered so much that my old schoolmates hardly knew me.  So enjoyed a very pleasant holiday & must admit received well from everyone who knew me.
