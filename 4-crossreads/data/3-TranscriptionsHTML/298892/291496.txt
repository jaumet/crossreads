<p>Military  Camp, Liverpool.<br/>2nd December 1915.</p>
<p>Dear Mother/<br/>I received two letters from you this week both as full of news as usual. I am very sorry indeed to hear of Cecil Bentley's illness, especially in so serious a form.<br/>Stirling's departure has now been deferred till the 13th. Instant. He came out to see me in his uniform last Sunday and he looks splendid in it. I have not receive mine yet and will not for another fortnight as I have to be in the A.A.M.C. a month before they will issue me with it. My old infantry contemporaries have received theirs.<br/>I am now on duty in one of the wards. My shift is from 2 am. till 6 am, and during that period I have to remain in the  Ward and attend to the needs of the patients, which are very few as most of them are sleeping soundly during those hours. There are no serious cases in our Ward. Before coming off in the morning I have to shake out the mats and sweep the place through. We change shifts every week and of course each shift has different duties to perform.<br/>When I am relieved at 6 am. I then have the morning free and have not to attend any parades until 2 p.m. when the rolls are called and we have a lecture on first Aid or some stretcher drill till 4 p.m. We then have tea about 5 p.m. and I am free till 2 a.m.<br/>There is also a roll call &amp; instructional parade in the morning but I have not to attend that on account of having been on night duty.</p>
