<p>we were going to land. But the idea of a landing at dawn seemed too unnatural when sitting in this luxurious Cabin, on a great Atlantic Liner, surrounded by hot and cold water, clean Stewards, iced Champagne, excellent Cigars, and plenty of perfect Sandwiches. Nevinson, who is very conscientious, had decided to sit up all night, to watch events, but the temptation to sleep between sheets, was irrestible. Therefore, having had a hot Bath, we turned in and were soon sound asleep, and personally I never had any idea what time we sailed and arrived, at Suvla Bay. I was wakened at about five thirty, by the deafening roar of innumerable big Guns, and having collected my thoughts, realised we must have arrived. Dressing hastily, I went on Deck, which I found crowded with Officers, peering out into the darkness towards the Land, which was just becoming visible.</p>
<p>Our first landing Parties were already ashore, and Troops were being hastily disembarked from the Transports, in the motor Barges specially sent out from England, for that purpose. We were lying about twelve hundred yards from the Shore, in Suvla Bay, and as the light increased we had a splendid view of all that passed. The life of the Sea, and the routine of years, when crossing the Atlantic, went on just the same on the Minneapolis. The numerous Stewards, instead of eagerly watching the Operations, went about their accustomed Tasks. Tea was served, and the chief Steward came on Deck with the announcement. 'Breakfast is usually at Eight thirty, but this morning it will be at Six thirty, as some of the Gentlemen may have to go on Shore early'.  At Six thirty therefore, a Bell rang, and we trooped down to the Saloon. On our way at the top of the Gangway, we passed an ancient Steward, who was bussily engaged in care-</p>
