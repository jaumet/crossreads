<p>land  between our front line and the German front line is lit up with flares and star shells as light as day. Some of the names of the German shells and bombs are  Rum jars, Oil cans, Pineapple whiz &ndash;bangs and Minni Werfers while one of our favourite rations for the hun is termed a plum pudding. I don't think they like the English plum pudding as well as we do though.  The great drawback here is the rain , it rains nearly every day which makes it pretty uncomfortable in the trenches. Out in the billets where we come out of the trenches for a rest it is not so bad as we have a house to live in and when the door of the room is closed and the windows shut it is fairly warm. I am thankful to say that I am keeping well and in very good health so far. Since landing here I have received another four letters, three from Spencer and one from home. Percy's last was dated Aug 2nd and must have come along fairly direct. He mentioned that you were dispatching a parcel to me but as yet I have not received it or any other, they may turn up though now that I have settled down.<br/> By all accounts the last winter in Australia must have been a very wet one,  it should have been just the one for our young orchard. I saw in an old Dubbo paper that the Macquarie River had risen 28 feet. I also saw where old Mr Dickerson had passed away a month or so after I left. The surroundings should be looking well now around Stuart Town and cattle and sheep should be good property. I was pleased to know that Aub was getting on so well, and trust that he will be able to knock around</p>
