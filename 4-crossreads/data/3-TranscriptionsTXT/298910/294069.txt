Very cold travelling - never stopped only for a few minutes at junctions - never had anything to eat since tea last night - Arrived at 'Port Reny" about 4.30 pm. Had to unload everything & then got a cup of coffee & biscuits - left "Port Reny" 5.30 pm - arrived at billets about 8.30 pm, after much cursing - roads were awful & it was drizzling & so dark couldn't see way - fell over a siding 6ft deep & never said - Having had no sleep last night & nothing to eat today - I felt very queer with Headache & cold - got an issue of rum & went to bed - no time before we were asleep - must have marched some 8 or 9 miles.
