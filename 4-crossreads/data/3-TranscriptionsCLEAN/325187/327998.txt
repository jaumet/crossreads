  
 [Tuesday 12 September 1916] 
 I have tea & dinner each night with Dolly have seen nothing of Laura or Charlie's wife- but I may see them later on. I've got a dose of Bronchitis but nothing bad. Hear all officers in England L H or any other are sent to the Infantry in France. I am wondering how I would stand the Winter there, its rather a shame to lose Seniority in your own crowd besides having no Kit in England. However one will see & its no use meeting the Devil half way- Cols Ryan & Mandesley are I am glad to say the Doctors I shall come before.
