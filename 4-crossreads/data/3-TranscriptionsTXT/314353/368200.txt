 66.  October 19 Related in the Huts. England:  an estaminet:  Australians and Americans. "Walt:  I don't think much of the god-damned beer, and its [indecipherable] enough!" "No! it is been waiting three years on the counter!" And another little pleasantry resulted. 
 67. 'The Letters of a Soldier', I have finished reading them this morning.  It is a book as lovely and wounderful as an old poem.  A book that should go singing of the "rich dead" down all the years to come. 
 I have marked many paragraphs&hellip;. and they are all to my Mother, to take to her some feelings I haven't well written. 
 68. 
 The Mother, P. Pearse I do not grudge them:  Lord, I do not grudge, My two strong sons that I have seen go out To break their strength and die, they &amp; a few, In bloody protest for a glorious thing, They shall be spoken of among their people The generations shall remember them And call them blessed: But I will speak their names to my own heart In the long nights: The little names that were familiar once Round my dead hearth. Lord, thou art hard on Mothers: We suffer in their coming and their going: And tho' I grudge them not, I weary, weary, Of the long sorrow &ndash; and yet I have my joy, My sons were faithful, and they fought. 
 October 19 
 Oh Lovely Head, P. Pearse Oh lovely head of the woman that I loved, In the middle of the night I remember thee: But reality returns with the sun's whitening, Alas, that the slender worm gnaws thee to-night. 
 Beloved voice, that wast low and beautiful, Is it true that I heard thee in my slumbers! Or is the knowledge true that tortures me? My grief, the tomb hath no sound or voice?
