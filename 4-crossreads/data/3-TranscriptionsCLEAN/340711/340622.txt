Thursday, 6.Usual routine. Horse lines in a terribly sloppy condition. McDonald utterly without psychological instinct. It is impossible to please him. The people of the Estaminets say they dread our going away---"Les Australiens sont tres riches", they aver. It is a good livelihood for them. It is a great relief, after the day's work to spend a couple of hours there with some "bons comrades".
Orderly sergeant from 6.pm. Walked over to Headquarters with Tattoo Report.
Friday, 7.Usual routine. Had my ordinary work of supervising F. Sub to do, in spite of Orderly Sergeant's duties. Wrote letters etc. in the evening. I am sleeping next the Sergeants' Quarters---in reality the Saddler's "Shop". The warm soft straw, sweet smelling, makes a most inviting bed. The Sergeants' Mess is in the cottage. Monsieur and Madame Mouton, an old, old couple who have lost three sons in the war. They welcome this augment to their income. Being the interpreter I score. She looks after me well. I eat in the little bedroom and storeroom off the kitchen.
Saturday, 8.Bryan, the O.C. returns from the firing line. He paints in his usual exaggerated style, the glory etc. of our new quarters. He is a mean-spirited, visionless cur. He cannot speak without betraying the dirty soul that lies within. Scarcely a parade passes without his foul abuse.
Sunday, 9.Went to the Church (Catholic) of Aire-sur-Lys. Interior was good. Could not follow the preacher. Concert in evening.
Monday, 10.Reveille 3.am. We were well out of Camp by 5.am. Of course
