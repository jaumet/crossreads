<p>Monday 15th May.<br/>A big surprise sprung on us today, we were given squad drill for a few hours. The heat today is terrible.</p>
<p>Tuesday 16th May.<br/>Inspection held of the camp today by the Deputy Director of Medical Stores &amp; A.D.M.S. Great preparations are being made for a big move somewhere, sincerely hope is out of Egypt. Weather most sever, it must be close on 120 in the shade. The dust &amp; the flies are also very unpleasant.</p>
<p>Thursday 18th May.<br/>On account of this severe &amp; most oppressive heat the Division were granted a holiday. It was even too hot to go for a dip in the Canal.</p>
<p>Friday 19th May.<br/>Instruction &amp; training in carrying wounded to &amp; from some abandoned trenches. Very interesting work, quirte a change from that monotonous stretcher drill.</p>
<p>Sunday 21st May.<br/>General inspection of 8th F. Amb. by General Mackay &amp; the A.D.M.S. All formed up in review order,  with all our transport in the rear. Stood like a rook for about 15 minutes, all marched out in column of route, the General noting our marching etc. he sent in a very satisfactory report on the inspection.</p>
<p>Monday 22nd May.<br/>It has been decided to hold big Divisional Manoeuvres today. reveille at 2 a,m,    Marched out of camp at 2:45 a.m. returning again about 9 o'clock. The attack etc. was very unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Tuesday 23rd &amp; Wednesday 24th May.<br/>More inspections etc. All this must surely mean that we will soon be making a move out of this hellish country.</p>
