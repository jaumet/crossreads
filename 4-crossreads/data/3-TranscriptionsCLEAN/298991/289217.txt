  
 Tuesday Sept 25th "J" boat roll was called this morning, & as I expected, I am on it. There are about 800 on it, out of this camp. The next boat roll is expected to clear the camp out. Went through medical inspection this morning, & kit inspection this afternoon. I had to hand back a pair of boots, a tunic, jack knife, & knife, folk & spoon. Everyone seems to be very pleased to be on the roll. A Bournemouth party gave a concert in the gym this evening, they weren't too bad. 
 Wednesday Sept 26th  "L" boat roll left early this morning to embark. We are expecting to leave tomorrow morning. Very dull & wet day. A party from the Pavillion Theatre, Weymouth gave a concert in the Gym this afternoon, they were very rough. Received orders tonight, reveille 3.30 am tomorrow morning, breakfast 4 am, so we will have to be up pretty early.
