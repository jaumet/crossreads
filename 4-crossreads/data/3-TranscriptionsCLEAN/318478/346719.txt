 This morning I was out at twenty minutes to sunrise to get the effect of light for the charge at the "Neck".  Very cold, bleak & lonely.  The Jackals, Damn them, were chorusing their hate, the bones showed up white even in the faint dawn and I felt rotten, but as soon as I got to my spot the colour of the dawn on this shrubby scrubby hilly-land was very beautiful and I did my little sketch quite well before breakfast. 
 Ten thirty saw Spruce & self struggling with a water colour of a very impressive subject - impressive both in art and military tradition. 
 The worst feature of this after battle work is that the silent hills & valleys sit stony, unmoved, callous of the human and busy only in growing bush, & sliding earth to hide the scars
