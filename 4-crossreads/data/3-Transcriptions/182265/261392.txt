<p><u>11th</u> This morning I slept in late. When Westwood came in it was about 11am. So we waited here at Hotel Moderne for lunch. I wrote to Jay &amp; prepared postcards for the post. This afternoon we visited Bastille, Boulevarde Germain, Chambre des Deput&eacute;s, Effel Tower, the Great Wheel on which we went.</p>
<p>Returning we went through <u>Commerce</u> a very busy shopping suburb. Here I bought a few articles for Billee.</p>
<p>A tube (Metro) brought us to <u>Madeleine</u>&nbsp;<s>from</s> near&nbsp;<u>Rue Royale</u> in which is the famous <u>Maximes</u> where we had a couple of Manhattans with another Australian officer we met there.</p>
<p>After Maximes we walked Boulevards des Capuccines &amp; continued right along the street to R&eacute;publique.</p>
<p>After dinner we had an interesting conversation with Miss O&#39;Connor an Australian Artiste who has lived many years in Paris &amp; Madame Rieu whose husband, an Englishman, was killed two months ago in The Foreign Legion of France</p>
