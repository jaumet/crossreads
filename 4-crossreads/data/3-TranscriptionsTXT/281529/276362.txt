 During the night the Hun dropped several shells very close at hand and one splinter went right through a threshing machine close by.   There is a perfectly good farm wagon in the yard and I ordered a team of horses to be brought up to shift it away to the rear and save it from shell fire.   The morning was dull and foggy and the outlook was blurred by the mist.   Last night our working parties were kept busy nearly all night and we also bathed a company.   My representations to the General regarding Engineering work in the Bde, have had a livening up effect and brought forth maps and a definite works policy.   Took Stewart and made a round of all the companies in their positions.   They have put in a great deal of work on their positions and made some very good bivouacs.   On the right of our sector between there and the Amiens -Albert road there is an area of ground which has not been strafed at all hardly.   Saw the different company commanders and found them all O.K.    Paraded Sergt Major Jack Blackmore and put the acid right on him.   I am afraid that he and Boxing Dick R.S.M. Porter are too thirsty for the good of the cause.   "A" Coy's rum reached them in a very diluted condition!   After dinner a thick fog came up and hung round all the vallies.   Inspected "C" Coy at stand to arms &amp; found them all correct and alert.   Jack Cowan &amp; Billy Green marched in as new subalterns in the regiment.
