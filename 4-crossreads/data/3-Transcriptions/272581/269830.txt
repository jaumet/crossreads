<p>August 1916<br/>lying about in shell holes &amp;  did not have much cover &amp;  the day was spent in sniping the few who dared to show themselves &amp;  they suffered a few casualties. During the afternoon of the 17th our own big artillery bombarded our front line &amp;  also next day &amp;  we suffered very heavily through same &amp;  it was afterwards found out to be a mistake on the maps of our front line for we were further advanced than shown on the maps. It rained on &amp; off  the whole time on &amp; off in the trench &amp; it was very uncomfortable for it was impossible to carry either overcoat of waterproof &amp; we were wet through &amp; through. It was during the afternoon of the 19th that our relief came &amp;  our battalion was relieved by the 10th Battalion &amp;  it was not till dark they we moved along the communication trench &amp;  we had to move at a good pace for Fritz's artillery was playing at different intervals &amp;  when we reached Albert a little after midnight we were all fatigued &amp;  had a much needed rest. Between the first &amp; second time we were at Poziers our troops had gained over three miles of country &amp;  then there were two divisions to follow us &amp; have been advancing. We remained in billets in Albert till the morning of the 21st &amp; then we had to move back to Warloy where we rested till next day &amp;  then marched to Val-de-Maison where we encamped in the first Anzac</p>
