 Wednesday 6 November Wet again &amp; prospects looked rotten for a move.  However, after having packed &amp; even fallen in one parade, an order came, say no movement of troops is to take place to-day. Postponed for at least 24 hours. Good news from the front, the Germans retreating  for  on a 70 mile front. 
 Thursday 7 November After three parades to-day, much to the amusement of the villagers, we finally moved by march route to Villers-sous-Ailly, six or seven miles, where we are now billeted in a huge barn. Oh, we miss our beds of Pont Remy. Peace is in sight!!  German delegates have crossed line to confer with Foch on armistice terms.
