 Saturday 4th dec We asked them to join us they said they would welcome us to their table which was in the only sitting room. We had a jolly good time until about 11 PM &amp; then as there was only 3 beds &amp; a sofa we had to go to a cottage &amp; sleep there. Our bed proved to be a long one on the floor. Mattress laid out &amp; we found 3 Tommies already in bed. We were not long in getting into bed but I could not sleep &amp; morning dawned but I had hardly closed my eyes. 
 I got up and managed to obtain a bucket of hot water from the good housewife. Of course she could not speak English &amp; it took a lot of explanations to make her understand. Again refreshed I made a good breakfast on fried eggs
