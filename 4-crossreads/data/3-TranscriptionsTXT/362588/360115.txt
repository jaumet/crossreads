 regiment.  I shall not do so.  I have no desire to join artillery.  I don't know anything about its work and of course it would not be playing the game for the 17th. 
 All the men are apparently quite happy.  There was considerable discontent about the rations at first but that has been put right now.  In addition to the issue of meat, tea &amp; vegetables, each man is allowed 8&frac12;d per day to be spent for him at the canteen.  This spending after a lot of trouble is now done by platoons and the scheme is now working well, the spending is done on such things as jam, tinned fruit, rice &amp; so on as the men themselves decide. 
 I have not been too well off in the matter of leave.  As a matter of fact I have been to Cairo only once &amp; then did not get there till 4.30 p.m.  I am going again tomorrow if all is well but have to be back here about 5 p.m. 
 Kindly give my best love to all at home.  My address will best be just "Egypt". 
 Ever yours sincerely C.R. Lucas
