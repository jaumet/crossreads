<p>Thursday 18 March 1915</p>
<p>The Brigade was astir at two o'clock this morning and proceeded to attack their opponents, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade.  The 14th, 15th and 16th Battalions formed the firing line, the local reserves and the supports, our battalion remaining in the rear to dig trenches for ourselves, as well as for the rest of the Brigade.  This was in case a retirement was necessary, as our troops would then have a line of defence upon which they could fall back.  As it happened they did have to retire, and a hot engagement took place at dawn between the New Zealanders attacking, and ourselves defending in the trenches.  Daylight put an end to the operations, no decision being given.  Both the Brigadier and the Divisional commander complimented the men of the 13th on the excellence of their trench digging which, they declared, was carried out in a good soldierly spirit, considering the difficulty and irksomeness of the task.  Shortly after eight, we arrived back in camp.  And for the rest of the day, a well earned spell was granted us.</p>
