May.
1st. Early this morning last night we have been taking troops on board we have now over 1000 men women children aboard. It was not without a thought that we pulled out of Devonport this evening passing many craft of war, with decks lined with cheering tars. The ensign was dipped to us from all boats. Anchor for the night, in Plymouth Sound, just off Plymouth Hoe. Devon with its red cliffs trees in flush of bud looks glorious.
