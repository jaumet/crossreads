11 February, 1916Drill as usual to day - quite an easy sort of day, longs smokes - Its funny to see the niggers come along as soon as we dismount for a spell selling chocolates & oranges - My mare wont give me a minutes peace when Ive got hold of an orange. Lost my shaving gear out of the tent & its all sorts of a blanky blanky. I had to get shaved by a Gyppo to night & he brought blood in more than one place.
