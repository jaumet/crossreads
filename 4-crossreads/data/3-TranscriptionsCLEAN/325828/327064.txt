To my loved ones at Home,An Ausy mail arrived this afternoon, & I was very lucky in receiving a budget from Cairnleith, 2 from Father, one from Mother, 2 from Olwen, 1 from Walter, & 1 from Anna & I wouldn't exchange my home letters for a King's ransom.  It is just on 6 weeks since I heard & I was awfully glad to hear from you againThank you all so very much for all your welcome letters.  For 2 or 3 days after I get a budget of Home letters, I feel awfully miserable & unsettled, I, who have thought myself immune from such maladies as homesicknessFathers of 5 & 12th August were as usual full of interesting news and what I value more full of personality.  Oh Father, dear, when is this rotten ghastly business going to be finished, & let us all unite again in peace & happiness.  I was indeed sorry to hear of your attack of influenza, but thankful you are in the hands of good nurses at home.Did I mention in my last letter that Percy Limn has been sent back to Ausy!  Lucky beggar.
