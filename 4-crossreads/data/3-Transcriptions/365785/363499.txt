<p>4th Field Ambulance<br/>N.3 &amp; Australian Division<br/>Anzac, M.E.F.</p>
<p>My dear Rene<br/>I have already stated in black &amp; white, and I again assert with the utmost vehemence &ndash; you are a real good sort!  Those two parcels arrived and have caused unbounded happiness in this Ambulance.  The men were like a lot of kids and your ears must have burned a bit.  Gawd bless you did not express it at all.<br/>Now I want you to do something else.  Send me 1 oz. of Acid Salicylic.  I'll pay you when I see you if not the Neesons [?] will.  This constant diet of Bully Beef &amp; no vegetables makes my skin very irritable &amp; I can have this made with an ointment which fixes it.<br/>We have had a pretty rotten time here this last scrap as you will have seen by the Casualty lists but we have got a good bit of Turkey in return, and where we are now, we are away from that awful shelling we used to get daily in Anzac.<br/>The second day after this scrap started I had my tent division in a dry creek bed.  A brigade marched at my rear, &amp;</p>
