 it seem imposs that human be can live in it , I 'm afraid my nerv are begin to give a littl , but can you wonder for I have been through someth that would make 99 % of men go under I ca n't complain about them . This bombard continu for an hour I was veri lucki for I had just got an "order " to join the Coy bring my men in when one of these enorm "oil drum " bomb land right where our outpost " was station , Provid again I reckon for had we been there it would have been good bye the lot we should never have seen Australia again , but there you are luck again
