been awful about 116 so sustained too,  it is over a 100 at 6.30 or 7 in the morning & doesnt  touch it again until about 5.30 in the evening. I find the best way of enduring it is to be out riding about in it. At present there is a rumour about that we are going back on the 13th towards Jaffa but nothing official as yet.
