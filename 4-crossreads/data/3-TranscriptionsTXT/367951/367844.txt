 [Thomas Bell Number 3770, was a miner aged 32 5ft 2 inches tall, with a wife Beatrice and four children from Great (just west of Maitland) in NSW when he enlisted on 6 September 1915 in the 9th Reinforcements, 20th Battalion. He wrote home regularly although not very literate and some of his spelling is amusing e.g. Kearnel for Colonel.  He was also clearly very homesick missing his wife and children.  The letters are fairly mundane but every now and then he lets things slip and some of his character comes through as well as the situation in the trenches e.g. seeing sandbags and bodies flying overhead; nerves all shook up.  So as not to spoil the diary for the reader, the outcome of Tom Bell's war is shown at the end of the diary.]
