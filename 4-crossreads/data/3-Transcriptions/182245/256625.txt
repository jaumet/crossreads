<p>20 FRIDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; Sunny. Cleaning harness</p>
<p>all day, &amp; as it got very rusty</p>
<p>it took some polishing again</p>
<p>We turned our horses out in</p>
<p>a paddock to graze, &amp; my</p>
<p>word they did enjoy themselves</p>
<p>I got three letters &amp; a parcel</p>
<p>from Linda &amp; two from Jo &amp;</p>
<p>some snaps. I camped</p>
<p>in a room in a farm</p>
<p>house. The first time to sleep</p>
<p>between sheets for months.</p>
