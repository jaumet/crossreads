<p>Saturday 7 [6] April 1917 [1918]<br/>All days are alike in this corner.  I read, write and think.<br/>The C.O. visits me again &amp; enquires perhaps kindly if am recovering but I distrust all visits knowing a fresh inj. of some "anti" will probably follow.  A day of wrath is this as the brainless creature known to the pts. as "Pat" refuses to do anything to relieve the irritable rash caused by "anti diph." but placing a hand on each fat hip she gazes vacantly at my smarting abd. and says "perhaps it is the bite of an insect".  Query! how is a woman of this type helping to win the war? beyond wasting time with the male pts., she is evidently only an ornament (?) at Shoubra.</p>
