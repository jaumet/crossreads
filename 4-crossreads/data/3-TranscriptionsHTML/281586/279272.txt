<p>3<br/>Swiftly and dauntlessly<br/>Soaring and climbing<br/>Capably, vauntlessly<br/>Treading the air<br/>Up where the clouds abound<br/>Mound upon snowy mound<br/>Drawing their robes around<br/>Hiding her there.</p>
<p>L Morris<br/>Beni Selah<br/>19-7-17</p>
<p>A Hymn<br/>1<br/>Jehovah, with a lavish hand<br/>Hath made the world so fair<br/>How blind indeed the eye which fails<br/>To find His imprint there.</p>
<p>2<br/>Each flower that on her slender stalk<br/>Uplifts her starry face<br/>Shows in her own sweet loveliness<br/>The wonders of His Grace</p>
<p>3<br/>The dews, the rains the seas, the skies<br/>The humblest life that Creeps<br/>Proclaims His presence in the World<br/>Who slumbers not or sleeps</p>
<p>4<br/>No life ere fails no sparrow falls<br/>Without He knows and cares</p>
