<p>26/1/16<br/>Course almost due W so any chance of going other than towards Aden seems improbable. Put on fatigue work today &amp; expected in fact the sergeant thought I was, cleaning out the scuppers &amp; drains, washhouses &amp; the showers etc. His mistake because Hop &amp; I were up in our old place near the spuds. Hooper &amp; Dad Perry get 7 day's fatigue for pinching ashore at Colombo &ndash; lucky. Eric swears that  if ever his children play at soldiers he will crack them with a shovel, before they get any silly ideas. Dad Perry &amp; Gertie Hooper get 7 days fatigue for staying ashore all night at Colombo.</p>
<p>27/1/16<br/>Gertie Hooper goes on sick parade  to avoid fatigue. Dad scrubs the tables. Since leaving Colombo the canteen prices have risen considerably. Little limes, a fruit as big as a walnut &amp; like a very small lemon, were bought in Colombo for 1/3 per hundred. At the canteen they cost sixpence per dozen &ndash; good profit.</p>
