23.5.16. Tuesday
Further preparations are in progress towards our intended departure, which cannot be long coming now. We are instructed that our Wagons, Harness etc has to be left here and in all probability our Horses also. This means that we will have to re-equip in France or wherever we go to.I was fortunate to receive a couple of Registered letters to-day from Nina, also a tin of Chocolate, which we highly appreciated.It seemed very funny to think that I should actually be reading Nina's letters eating the chocolates, whilst there was a very lively Cannonade of Big Guns going on only a few miles away on one of our positions.Within a few hundred yards of us, the Pioneers Infantry are very busy digging a last of line of trenches erecting barbed wire entanglements. To see the entanglements closely one marvels how on earth anything living could get through them, whilst under heavy fire from commanding positions, yet it is done.They are also sinking thousands of pits on the desert lining them with the usual barb wire. God help the men who fall into them is all I can say.
