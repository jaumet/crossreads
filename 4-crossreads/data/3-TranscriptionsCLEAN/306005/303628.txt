This morning I sent Les Olson  to bring out  to Mazar to bring along 8 miles of wire & a bundle of flag poles sent on by train, he arrived back with the poles but said there is no wire there, so that means a trip for me tomorrow. Lt. Garbett & Maj. Irwin went out today (East) & were within 12 miles of El Arish & could see the spire in El Arish. A Turkish  Outpost  patrol went within half a mile of them & quite close to one of our Outposts who have received orders not to fire on them, we believe there are about 8,000
