<p>Decembre 2<br/>Resting today on account of having bad feet. Have just heard that I have been awarded a Bar to my Military Medal. Section engaged on strong points and Corps line defence work. Weather getting much colder &amp; we had a little snow this morning.</p>
<p>Decembre 3<br/>Most of the Section are putting out wire on Corps &amp; Support lines &amp; other defence work. I am still taking things easy just looking after a little H.Q. work. We are reported to have had a set-back near Cambrai.</p>
