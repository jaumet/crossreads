<p>got a tin of condensed milk, after which I went round to Fullwood and then back to the loft till tea-time. Since then I've been lying down. I'm hoping that the clouds will continue to pile up and keep the usual raid off, so that I can get some sleep.<br/>Tomorrow I have an interview with a big gun, but what about I don't exactly known. It may be that I will get instructions which will prevent me writing tomorrow, but I hope not.</p>
<p>St Gratien, France.<br/>6/7/18.<br/>Last Night, after finishing my letter, I went for a stroll with a couple of friends and then turned in early. In spite of a raid I got a fair night's sleep and this morning tried my hand at a nocturne - a night bombardment; they're wonderfully interesting things to do. At 2-30 to-day, I motored over to corps, where I found my 0.C. and Captain Bean. Bean is an extremely interesting man and altogether affable. In fact he seemed to me full of good qualities and I count it a pleasure and honour to have met him. Benno and Louis McC. were there too, and we had a quite extensive discussion as to the scope of our jobs. It developed that, for the present, at least, the more artistic side of the job will be, to a large extent, in abeyance and the part for which we went to school will take up most of our time. This was still further emphasized by the declarations of Major Casey who came along and gave a little disquisition as to our duties; from which we may safely anticipate a very busy time. But the appointments will be important ones, or should be, if we choose so to make them, and for apres la guerre the prospects are<br/>BON. Our 0. C. predicts that we will get our starts in about a month from to-day; May 5th being the starting date of the probational three months. We had afternoon tea with Captain Bean, who proved to be a charming and most entertaining host and when all was finished, he drove us back to our several stations; Louis being the first to drop off. When we came to my village, we struck Murdoch and Gilmour, two journalists who come in Mr. Hughes' train and as I got off, they got in and went on to Ben's abode, where they would leave him and so back to Corps.
