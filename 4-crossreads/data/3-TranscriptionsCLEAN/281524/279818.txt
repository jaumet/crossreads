  
 1/10/17 Hannebeke Wood and a 4.2 gun was still standing in it emplacement knocked right out. The pillbox was not a bad one. Someone complained of dead Germans sitting in a tunnel but our witty doctor said one would not expect to find live ones there now. A considerable amount of gas was put over during the night and the mustard smell was perceptible but did not warrant putting on the masks. It made me feel ill and with the close smell of herded men and the stink of the filth on the floor I nearly vomited. Got very little sleep. An order arrived from Bde. to relieve the 23rd. 24 hours earlier than we anticipated and I 2/10/17  (indecherable) had to send up for Bunning and Rodda at once to make necessary arrangements. Bunning was shaken having had men killed beside him and others wounded. I put both these chaps to bed. Rodda is a dear fat thing.
