Thursday 16 January 1919Rain again last night but the sand absorbs it.Dolly now writes she thinks she would like to sail next month for Australia - will cable you when she does & hope it won't be too hot in Deniliquin for her in March.  Nothing definite re myself but I have hopes of being home by then.  Not much chance of our sailing together.Played a game of Polo yesterday, am not much good but like it very much.
