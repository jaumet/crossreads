ThursdayHave been to Houplines.  It is my week at the Canteen.  The Germans have been shelling today down there.
FridayThe Hun has been pretty busy again at Houplines, quite a lot of shells went over our Canteen & landed about 100 yards away.  He is searching for guns evidently.  He shelled our trenches with shrapnel this morning.  Tonight at 8 oclock our guns opened a terrific bombardment which lasted 3/4 of an hour.  It sounded like a raid.  Flares went up continuously from the German lines.  The weather has been cold but not so cold as last week.
Saturday Feb. 17I did not go out to Houplines.  I had to have a hot bath & it took most of my morning.  This afternoon I made arrangements for Sunday.  The British War Loan closed yesterday.
