both ours & the Huns are veritable infernos. Still the conditions are good. The country is drying up fast, weather fine, and we are comfortably fixed up.
I must tell you that   I have now taken my Battery has now become a Howitzwer (4.5") The General (Rosenthal) wished me to have the Howitzers in our Brigade, as I had done a little of it, so that is how it has come about. The change is satisfactory to me of course as the "Hows" get plenty to do and are absolutely the latest thing in guns. We are now the 111th (How) Battery, not the 43rd as before , although the personnel of the Battery has not been changed.
It is good to see some of the old 1st
