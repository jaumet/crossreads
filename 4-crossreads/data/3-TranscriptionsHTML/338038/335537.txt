<p>[Newspaper cutting]<br/>The Sydney Mail.  29th May 1918<br/>[Photograph]<br/>Major Terence Ward Garling<br/>Born 15th February, 1894; died from wounds in France 5th April, 1918</p>
<p>Writes one who knew him:  A message born to me on the wings of ill-fate gave me a stab of grief as a blast from an icy blizzard, for it told me of the death of this young soldier.  I had known him from the joyous sunlight of his childhood, through his youth and on to his manhood, that proved him to be a man who knew how to die for his King and Empire.  With a captivating spirit and intrepidity borne of strong character and cheery temperament, he instilled that confidence to his men that he himself possessed.  He was as generous as he was brave.  Affection, kindness, love, and duty were to him dear as life.  His civilian occupation was spent with credit in the service of a firm of Sydney stock and station agents, and his military career speaks for itself, for he commanded a six-gun battery, A.F.A., with the rank of major before he was 23 years of age.</p>
<p>Leaving Sydney in October, 1914, he went through the Gallipoli campaign, fought continuously in France for two years in the famous 4th Division, was twice gassed, but never got a wound till, alas, the one that killed him.  His associations with France were not confined to the part he played as a soldier.  Some of his ancestors were educated in Paris, and he fought over the same fields in Flanders and Belgium as did one of his progenitors, Lieut. William Gordon Ward, 1st Regiment Royals; and another, Lieut. Fredk. Bedwell R.N., in the days of England's wooden walls served in the Northumberland when she conveyed Napoleon to St. Helens.  Sincere appreciation of Major Garling is added to by that of recently-returned soldiers who served under him.  He rest at Warloy-Baillon, on the banks of the Somme.<br/>"Above the grasses stands a simple cross<br/>Whose shadow falls athwart the leagues of sea<br/>Upon my heart &ndash; sad with its sense of loss,<br/>While tear-dimmed eyes stare on Life's mystery."</p>
<p>[Newspaper cutting]<br/>S.M. Herald  12/1/20<br/>Diggers at Amiens.<br/>Mr. Joseph E. Scott, Forbes , writes, taking exception to the statement of General Rosenthal, that the third Division of the Australians held up the advance of the enemy at Amiens, and states that the actual stopping of the German advance and the re-taking of Villers-Bretonneux were carried out by the Fourth and Fifth Australian Divisions.  In support of this claim he quotes from Sir Douglas Haig's report:- "A counter-attack was launched by a brigade of the 18th Division and the 13th and 15th brigades of the Fourth and Fifth Australian Divisions, and met with remarkable success.  A night operation of this character undertaken at such notice, was an enterprise of great daring.  At day-break Villers-Bretonneux was practically surrounded by our troops, and two battalions of the 8th Division worked their way through the streets and houses, overcoming the resistance of such parties of the enemy as were still holding out."</p>
