<p>25 December 1918 Wednesday<br/>XMAS DAY<br/>All hands merry many drunks- &frac12; lbs of PLUM PUDDING, 6 eggs, vegetables &amp; a parcel from the Comforts fund- football &amp; [indecipherable] different officers the recreation-!!!  Nearly all the old fighting men have gone &amp; a new lot are here who know not us-   Rumours we may leave here soon for nearer the Canal but who knows.<br/>Started an Officers Mess all together many months since we ate together now.<br/>I thought of you all today &amp; only hope we may be together ere long-  Just got a Post Card from Joe written in Vancouver I hope he got home safely-</p>
