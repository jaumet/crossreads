 March 1918 Tuesday 19 
 Messines 4.30 am. F.O.O. and A.T.P. heavily shelled with gas and HE  5am Roadway received another pasting with gas and HV At 6 am it commenced to rain and did not discontinue all day through. I guided Laurence to O.P. and on my return went to HQ for the pigeons, but came back without any birds owing to the rain. At midnight Fritz shelled F.O.P. some more, and increased the calibre to 4.2 Received a letter from Roy, he is awfully "bucked" about some good news.
