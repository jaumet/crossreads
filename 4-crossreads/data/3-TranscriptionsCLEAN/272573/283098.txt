  
 destroying a splendid bed of lettuces. 
 May 23rd. Tues. Put in charge to fix up 'D' Ward. 
 May 24th. Wed. Troops that are passing through the village from north to south of the line are selling curios or soveniers of their fights. German Helmets, Bells, Revolvers, etc. 
 May 26th Frid. Saw a remarkable instance of how a Steel Helmet saved a soldier's life. Their was only a slight wound on his head but if he had not had had the helmet on, his skull would probably have been shattered by a bullet 
 Received the Anzac Book which I had ordered and paid for in Egypt. It is a very interesting and good souvenier of our stay on the Anzac position. Every word and every picture of it seems to be familiar to me. 
 After having a walk along the road outside of the village we dropped in to Madame Couzet's to have a cup of coffee. I noticed that Madame tonight seemed a bit worried and on making inquiries I learned that the village people have been warned to clear out of the village within a month or remain at their own risk. 
 May 28th. Sun. Had the afternoon off. Walked out to Sailly. Sur. Lye.
