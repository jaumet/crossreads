<p>Just sent for 2 more of these Diarys the cost being 3/3 each, being practically double what I paid for the first I bought in Sydney before the war.   Orders out that soldiers asking for rations to be handed over to a guard as their are still a large number roaming about the country, relics of the retreat.   A body of 30 marched into the village yesterday &amp; tried to get rations.</p>
<p>Thursday 4th April<br/>    Rainy weather.   Made up a requisituion for dressings etc &amp; went along to Beauval to get them in the afternoon spending about an hour in Doullens on the way.    Passed large gangs of Chinese &amp; labour battalions digging trenches &amp; wiring them in readiness for Fritz should he advance.   Had word that we were about to move on my return so walked to "Acheux" the next village to see what the 54th Bn wanted.   Brought back one of their A.M.C. Staff &amp; gave him dressings etc.   Then supplied the 56th 55th Bris &amp; 28th A.S.C. &amp; then had to turn to &amp; pack up my own stuff as well as evacuate several sick to Hospital.   Turned in about 11 P.M. all my things being ready</p>
