<p>It was a pity that the rain spoilt so much of the young fruit as it did but perhaps the trees will be all the better for the good soaking in a year or too. As in Australia this has been one of the wetter years here for a long time and since coming here in September we have hardly had one fine day, and lately it has been raining constantly. I was very pleased to see that Aub was still doing well, perhaps he is on the real road to recovery this time. Also comes the good news that Ciss has another young daughter both of whom are doing well! I have had several letters from Clarry lately and he seems to be doing all right in Orange , he also has kept me well informed in home news of late. Percy informed me that he had spent the Xmas holidays up North so you must have had a very quiet Xmas all right.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems no time to me since Xmas day, yet 3 months of the new year have already gone.</p>
