<p>struck the identification disc, glanced off &amp; just left a flesh wound, a shell struck a water bottle leaving a bruise only, a wristlet  watch  shattered, a sailor stooping to pull a boat ashore received a bullet up the anus he afterwards died &amp; so on.

<p>Wednesday 28th  now steaming to Alexandria  All hands busy dressing wounds.  Myself mostly engaged at dispensary &amp; injecting morphia when necessary  Another job was to supply Iodine &amp; dressings etc to all.  Did the rounds at night with opium about 200 taking draughts.</p>
<p>Thursday 29th  Still fine weather.  Arrived at Alexandria about dusk &amp; M.O. went ashore to arrange about landing wounded.  It was decided to land 60 of the worst cases &amp; the motors arriving at 12 P.M. we commenced &amp; finished up about 4. A.M.  Turned in for 2 hours sleep</p>
<p>Friday 30th Up early &amp; was glad to be able to get a supply of oranges, as tucker lately not of the best.  The motors arrived again about midday &amp; we landed about 250 more bad cases  this being all the Hospitals could take the balance having to go to Malta. Tried to get leave but was unsuccessful could only sneak along to the next ship &amp; see some men of my unit.  Here they had 2 Turkish wounded</p>
