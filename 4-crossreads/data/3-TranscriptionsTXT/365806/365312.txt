 [On letterhead of John McLaughlin &amp; Son, Solicitors, Union Bank Chambers, Hunter Street, Sydney] Jn. B. 7 November 1916 My dear Judge: 
 Herewith letter of the 19th August you asked me for, also a cutting which will be of interest to you. 
 Geoffrey has, perhaps, fortunately been wounded &ndash; he received a shell splinter in his right leg.  He had just had his first ten days spell, and on return, apparently had forgotten the way to keep out of the road. 
 You need not trouble about forwarding these, as I will send up for them some time. 
 Yours faithfully, J. H. McLaughlin 
 His Honour Mr. Justice Ferguson Judges Chambers Court House Sydney. 
 Encl.
