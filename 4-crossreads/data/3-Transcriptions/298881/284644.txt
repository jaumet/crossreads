<p>a most painful yet comical sight.  Two Portuguese soldiers trying to drive a pair of mules.  Each animal pulling against the other and propping with their front feet all the time.  It was astonishing <strike>what</strike> how they managed to make any progress at all.

We then returned to the chateau spinning along at a great pace the Major driving.  We had to stop once to allow the engine to cool.</p>
