We move out immediately with full packs blankets up for Bazentin-le-Petit ? 6 miles further up where the Dressing Station was during the late stunt. Have 2 rests on the way. Pass Casualty Corner Pozieres, thro Contalmaison once agains. Point out the places of history to the new reinforcements. Arrive at destination on 5.30 p.m. tea. Pretty tired.
