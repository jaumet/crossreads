<p>different classes of the different countries I have been in, both rich and poor. Before I forget it tell George that there is no place like home and that Sydney is the best place to stay in. The 2 months fighting that I <strike>have</strike> have done in a strange country is hell with the lid off. Hard work sleepless days and nights on the watch, and your food not always at hand   when you get it, it is only Bully beef &amp; hard <strike>biscuits</strike> Biscuits some times a little extras not often. I hope to get back home very soon. Now a little bit home. I hope the the lane is just the same.</p>
