July, 1915Tuesday 13The hot climate & discomfort is making all hands very short-tempered & livery, a trip to Gallipoli & a bullet thro' the anatomy would be a good cure if not fatal. The Horses too are getting very fretful & fresh for the want of proper exercise.We cannot exercise so many & always in the Reed covered stables, tortured by flies they get short-tempered.
