<p>17 [16] May, 1916<br/>main body was camped   A Tp was rear guard to this spot.  I got a drop of stinking water here &amp; washed my parched mouth with it   After about an hour C &amp; B moved off &amp; I got in with the first of them   Some officers &amp; men started to throw in the sponge here.  We got to the palms where we started that morning &amp; I went on thinking I would get a [taste?] for the mare but the water was so low that a man had to get in the well &amp; fill the bucket with a qt pot - I got a drink when I got there &amp; I staggered as I got up from drinking - then after a lot of bustle got my bucket full &amp; I was rushed as soon as I got it, I handed it around to the famishing chaps until there was only a drop left then had a drink &amp; half filled my bottle but I gave this to my section mates &amp; Perce.  Harold went out to it here &amp; many others also.  about 36 were brought in by the Ambulance.  We started off for Katia about 4 miles, it seemed a hundred;  J Woods horse knocked up &amp; a lot of others;  My mare was wobbly &amp; panting but the plucky little beggar kept going.  I got a bit feverish &amp; was about all in when at last we sighted the well at Katia &ndash; here I drank about a gallon &amp; a half &amp; it's a wonder it did not turn me up &ndash; Les Godber boiled some quarts &amp;</p>
