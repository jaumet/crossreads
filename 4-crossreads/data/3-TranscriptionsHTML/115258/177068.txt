<p>She is a nice person. Her brother is in the 1st Regt&nbsp;and is now flying here. The films also arrived safely thank you. Am afraid this letter is very untidy but my pen went dry and now I&#39;m using just a stump of a pencil. I hope you wont go and think I&#39;m sick because I&#39;m in hospital. If I was at home and felt lie I do now I think I&#39;d go digging out rabbit burrows or something equally hard so that shows you how bad I am. Of course I&#39;m a bit thin, but weigh some where about 11 stone 10 lbs and expect to go some where about 14 stone when I leave land of milk &amp; honey and get on to the cream and honey at home. Gee that&#39;ll be fine I&#39;ll try and send you a cable if I find out what&#39;s doing at any time. Guess it will be a dinkum Christmas this year alright. Love to Hal and Fred and yourselves.</p>

<p>Your loving son</p>
