Feel off-   Had a glass of  Champagne  this morning & good food- only a bit weak now X Hear Kaiser has abdicated & all German troops gone back to Rhine is it true? Hope you won't worry when you see or hear I'm ill  Really nothing  & soon OK   May cable if I go as far as Cairo. Jerusalem is full of prisoners & captured GUNS & war material   I saw some labelled 1st L.H.
