<p><strike>Monday</strike> Sunday May 27.  Glorious morning.  In the Garden, a thrush was singing away merrily &amp; across the meadows came the call of the cuckoo.  I looked out of the window.  In the distance, the village Church bells were ringing &amp; all seemed good with the world.  What a difference to Bullencourt  After shaving &amp; ablutions I went down to Breakfast Bacon &amp; Eggs, &amp; nice Fresh Butter Gee! How I enjoyed it.  After Break. went round the Farm with Mr Blakeman, Frank &amp; young Alec.  My word he's a bonnie kid. <br/>The crops are looking excellent.  There is plenty of Food for the cows &amp; they look fat &amp; content.  How I enjoyed my Dinner.  Roast Beef, Potatoes, Cabbage, followed by Beastings Pudding.  I almost felt ashamed of my appetite.  After Dinner we adjourned to the Drawing Room where Ruth played, &amp; Jack's wife sang. Three kiddies came to Dinner.  The elder girl was very pretty but she played the piano viley.  I quite enjoyed that afternoon.  After Tea I went to Church with Mrs Blakeman &amp; Ruth.  We arrived late.  It was a very nice service, &amp; the parson preached a good serMon.  In his spare time he works on the Land.  We had supper on our return.  Then Mr B. &amp; I sat yarning for about an Hour.  I went to Bed feeling at Peace with the world.</p>
<p>Monday May 28.  After Breakfast I borrowed Frank's Bike &amp; went to see Lizzie Rowley, who lives about a mile away from Ruth's.  It was great to ride along the peaceful country roads, with the birds singing merrily &amp; the sun shining; &amp; very pleasant to talk to people in good old English after being in France &amp; Egypt for so many months.</p>
