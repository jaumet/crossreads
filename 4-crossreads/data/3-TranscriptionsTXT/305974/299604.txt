18 TuesdayA fine day.  Sea very calm.  Very stormy looking evening also windy. The ships paper never came out.  Supposed to have crossed equator today.  Rained during the night.  Slept below deck, but hot in a hammock.  We are all looking forward to the first issue of the ships paper.  It is very nice forward, but the majority of the troops seem to assemble there.
19 WednesdayA very cloudy day, rained slightly.  General kit inspection held to try & locate 7-10-0 & gold watch that was lost.  Detailed for Police duty.  Sports & Boxing held in afternoon.  Debate on Conscription - Voluntaryism held in F Ward in the evening.  Got negatives from Dispensary.  They didn't turn out very good, not bad though for an amateur.
