June 14 & visited relations to no end. Tonight we were entertained at Kings until nearly midnight. Seems strange seeing all the old spots where Dad played as a boy. Tinkers green is just behind us.  The Sexton (aged 50) related tales of long past.
15  Dull & cool but no rain. Visited the old town Hall which stands in the centre of the Street & its interesting too; the ducking stool, the stocks, the old Russian Cannon & several other relics paintings & silhouettes. There is also a fairly good library & pipes for heating purposes run round the sides of the roomLeaving for Portishead this afternoon. Later - Quite a crowd at the Station to see me off. Some swank! What? Just caught the train at Avonmouth after a sharp run. After tea we all went for a walk along the coast past the Nautical School & back It's a lovely walk too
