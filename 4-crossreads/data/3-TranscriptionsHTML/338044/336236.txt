<p>9th August:- Wednesday<br/>Every indication of a fine day as we leave home but towards midday turns out cloudy &amp; cold &amp; threat of rain. This does not deter us from pursuing our tour of the suburbs &amp; take a tram to Boisguillaine after work. From here another fine view of the town is obtainable &amp; in a different direction from Bonsecours. A fine monument of ernormous size is erected near here, represting the industries of France.
