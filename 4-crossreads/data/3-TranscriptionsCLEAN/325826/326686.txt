  
 Box Hill. Melbourne Friday 16.7.15 R & A 19.7.15 P.S. I meant to say that the boat left at 20 to 4, not such a long wait as I had feared.  Initials.  Yes, thank you Father the manuscript arrived safely yesterday.  Initials. My dear Father & Mother, I was very glad to get the home news when I came in this afternoon from seeing the "Demosthenes" off.  Father's letter was here waiting for me.  I hope Le will get on well & all the colds & "unwellness" in the house disappear, and that very soon. Rid went on board a little before 12 just before the troops went on- about 2000 there were, they said.  We were all kept behind barriers at the entrance to the Pier, about 5 minutes walk from where the boat lay- a big crowd of people there were & it was only just when the ropes were thrown off & the boat was about to leave that the barricades were unlatched & there was a mad scramble along the wharf to try to reach the boat before she got quite away, to wave the final good-byes.  Doris & I ran our hardest & just succeeded in getting a good look at Rid & a shouted message from him & the boat had gone!  But I had a lot of waves from him after, as she passed quickly out, for we had arranged a special sort of wave.  Everybody has been very kind indeed here & I will try & be content to stay a little while, though I feel terribly restless & want to get home.  Still I am going to try & remember that "A lowly heart that leans on Thee is happy anywhere." Forgive brevity, but I find it hard to write at length. Much love Ollie.
