<p>Monday 20 August</p>
<p>At 4 a.m. whilst I was asleep on the floor of the 5th Canadian Mobile Bact. Laboratory at Bailleul one of our car drivers entered and woke me up.  We travelled back via Pradelles, picked the bike up and dropped it in the workshops at Blaringhem &ndash; then returned to our unit in Racquinghem in time to hear Reveille blowing.  I made up my report of the accident and gave the names of three witnesses from a British Machine Gun Unit</p>
