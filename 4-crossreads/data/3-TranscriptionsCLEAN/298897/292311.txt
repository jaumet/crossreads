where that particular hospital was.
Tuesday 4th JulyA very busy day in the dispensary, a fair number of sick and had to supply four battalions with drugs.  Heavy rain in the afternoon quite a change from what we have been used to.  Can hear nothing of anyones whereabouts information being hard to obtain, a very good sign.  I can see evidence on all sides showing good management and a thorough grasp of details.
Wednesday 5th JulyHad a very interesting day.  Went with the car in the morning in order to pick up some sick from various billets & to give instructions to the billets or rather battalions how to conduct their sick parades & forward particulars etc.  On our way to the Hospital at Hazebrouck we dropped the Colonel at headquarters for him to get our pay.  This necessitated a big detour & I obtained a very good idea of the surrounding country.  Soldiers were everywhere.  Every barn, stable or outhouse had its complement & men were drilling & marching in all directions.  Here & there I saw old trenches & wire entanglements
