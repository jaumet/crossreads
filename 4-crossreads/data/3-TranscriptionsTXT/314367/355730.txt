There's a lot of wasters about like that in all expeditions - However they generally get a very rotten time & often wind up in gaol - I blame Johnson for a good deal - His absolute want of character makes him a cats paw among the men & he glides from lie to lie & plausible ones too like a snake from hole to hole - I had him up before an Officer & J remarked that I didn't seem to believe him & I said 'No I don't - I believe very little that you tell me - the greater part may be true or it may not' - Why a bad character like this goes with any expedition I know not - I took the man up to the Hosp from the Una as as Skeete & the military don't let it - This time I had my men well in hand - "Shore party will stand by Stretcher until ordered to proceed". That kept them together - I got the man shifted - "Shore party will now man stretcher & return to the whaler - Quick march"  I kept them all moving & shoved off & the job was done -
