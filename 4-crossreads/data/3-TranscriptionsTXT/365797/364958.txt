Are insects bad in France?
News all points in one favour just now but somehow I can't believe that theGermans will give down suddenly. There will be heavy fighting before they are driven out of Belgium &amp; we all feel quite disappointed that Mr. Hughes has not brought in cons-cription so that the men may all be in training at once &amp; ready to send along in the early spring.
We are very quiet now during week ends &amp; I am trying to get the house in order after the mix up that Dene had.
Good night dear; we are hoping for a letter by tomorrow's mail. With love from us all
Mother.
