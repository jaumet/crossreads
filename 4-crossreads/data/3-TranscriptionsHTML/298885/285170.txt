<p>of Clarmarris [?] Forest. This forest is said to hold good sport in the way of pheasants, deer etc. During our stay we took a stroll through this large thickly wooded enclosure with its dense undergrowth</p>
<p>It is a very pretty piece of scenery and the walk was very enjoyable, likewise the cool breeze, which blew gently thro the leave, we found very exhilarating.</p>
<p>These French woods with all their greenery have a picturesque view of their own, but as we made our way along</p>
