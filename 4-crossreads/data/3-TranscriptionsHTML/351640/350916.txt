<p>To return to your letter.   Dr. Kennedy will be here again soon.  I hope that he will come to see me or that I may have chance to speak with him.   As you anticipated two lots of letters were delivered to me this week.   Many thanks for writing so long and such interesting letters, it cheers the heart of an old man to have so much chat with you.   Thanks.  How strange that the necessaries commodities such as butter and sugar should be scarce with you.  There is full and plenty here.  My large family;  400 tonight require a lot of feeding in the way of common necessities but the material is always forthcoming, and the price does not seem to be excessive, judging from the fact that the money provided for me covers easily the material required and leaves plenty over.  My staff is of the best and I keep an eye upon the expenditure being made in the correction direction.  Every one is well fed and their needs being well satisfied they do not growl in the slightest, the money should all be spent on the family but when they are content what is the use of wasting it.  You may be imagining that I have grown to be a good housekeeper, if so it is the result of your training.

<p>Mr. Finney will know best what to do about selling the Lambton house.   Be guided by him in the matter.   He is the best to help you in all money matters.   You will pull through all right in the way of finances, in that I have the utmost confidence, and all will be well in the end for you.  When will the war end?   No one knows. Did you notice that one the of the men highly placed in London said during the week that by Christmas time the number of men and the quantity of munitions would be favourable to the allies, in my idea twill be at least then before such happy result will be achieved, and then only if Russia has recovered from the stunning blows which daily she is receiving.  Yes my dear we are on the down grade of the year and the months ahead will rapidly slip past to the end of 1915.<br/>The Argonne of which we became so heartilly sick some months ago has cropped up again in the war telegrams from France, it is somewhat disheartening to note that after all the loss of life and struggling that has taken place along the South to North line in France, the Germans are as far in the country as they were one month after they set out on the invasion, the while they have been fighting a great war at the other end of their territory against the most numerous of all their foes.  Mirabile dictu .</p>
<p>Yes my dear the Kinemakeler picture spoke truly when it showed the superior training of the German as a soldier.  You remember how</p>
