  
 28 Men were put into a Permanent Mess of 14 each and Orderlies for the Voyage was called for and I volunteered and will officiate for the Trip. We have got the best part of our Troop Deck, plenty of light and ventilation. There is accomadation for 480 Men and still plenty of room as it is very wide and everything is clean, the fittings all being new. I was a bit restless the first night sleeping in my Hammock, but was very comfortable and will soon get used to it. We draw Meals at 8 am 12 noon and 5 Pm and from all appearances the food is splendid, plenty of it and well cooked, The Bread is really delicious, we draw it at 7.30am, 5 long loaves per day and nice and fresh, quite a treat after the stale bread in France. All day long the Boys were doing Fatigue Work loading & stowing Red Cross stores and Y.M.C.A & Canteen Supplies. At 5 Pm High Tide, our Good Ship was pulled out of the Dock and backed down through the channel into the Thames which took them 1 1/4 hours as she is so long
