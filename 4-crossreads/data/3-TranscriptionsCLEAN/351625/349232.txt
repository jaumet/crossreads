  
 you can expect us home by next Christmas & what a time we will have, say at Shellharbour again.  I don't know whether I have told you how much pay we draw over here, it is 40 Francs a pay which  has  is supposed to be once a fortnight but of course we don't always get it regularly to the day.  1 Franc equals 100 centimes, 10 centimes equals 1 penny.
