The "Wassa"or the low & immoral portion of Cairo was the scene of another disgraceful piece of work organized by some of our noble soldiers. A rumor was spread abroad that a soldier was robbed by one of the women & in consequence vengeance was the order of the day. Fires were lit in a number of the buildings & furniture was thrown from high windows & balconys & for a time one could imagine hell was let loose
