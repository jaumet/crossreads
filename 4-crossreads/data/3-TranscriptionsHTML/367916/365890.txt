<p>I take it the [indecipherable] gives you any news about me that I sent her. I can't talk of couorse about the things I'd like to. Signals is all my life at present Jack.</p>
<p>France<br/>7th July 1918.</p>
<p>Dear Judge,<br/>Very many thanks for your letter dated 29th. April and the cable forms which all arrived O.K. I must tell you right away Judge, that the chocolate has been arriving O.K. all along and that I can't thank you enough for it. I have written you of this but I suppose the subs play up a bit with the mails.</p>
<p>Our knowledge of dates etc are so vague that when we are told a certain mail has gone down we haven't the faintest idea what letters we wrote that were about that mail.</p>
<p>Life is flowing along in fine</p>
