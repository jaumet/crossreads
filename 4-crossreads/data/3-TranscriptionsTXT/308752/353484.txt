Band performance in the gardens, met a number of old pals, including Holmes from Hooper &amp; Harrison, Dickinson &amp; Redmond from Neutral Bay.

He is only 17 years old &amp; is a Stretcher bearer. 27 years old today,  it the war lasts much longer I will be too old to settle down &amp; get married. Received parcels from relations in England.

(Of course as usual I will not b e able to mention any names of places etc.)   At mid-day we marched through C [blank] a fine little township situated on a hill from which a grand view of the surrounding country was obtained. Arrived at ---- about 7 o'clock,  every one dog
