Saturday 4th decWe asked them to join us they said they would welcome us to their table which was in the only sitting room. We had a jolly good time until about 11 PM & then as there was only 3 beds & a sofa we had to go to a cottage & sleep there. Our bed proved to be a long one on the floor. Mattress laid out & we found 3 Tommies already in bed. We were not long in getting into bed but I could not sleep & morning dawned but I had hardly closed my eyes.
I got up and managed to obtain a bucket of hot water from the good housewife. Of course she could not speak English & it took a lot of explanations to make her understand. Again refreshed I made a good breakfast on fried eggs
