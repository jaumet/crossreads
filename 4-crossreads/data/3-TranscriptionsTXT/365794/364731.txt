Friday 23 November 1917In Maxwell till 9.30 a.m. then Kitchener till 2 p.m., off 2-5, then Maxwell 5-8.  Nothing but wounds & dressings all day & such patient men.  One case practically whole of lower jaw & part mouth shot away - man so quiet & cheerful.  1 pt. told me how a wounded Turk had a few days previously implored the men, our soldiers, to lend him a razor to cut his throat, he had fallen off a lorry & lying by the roadside.  Our fellows gave the razor & watched him cut his throat!! & the man told me as though it were the most ordinary occurrence.
