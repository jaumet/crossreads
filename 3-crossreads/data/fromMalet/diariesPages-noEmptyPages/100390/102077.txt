the pick of the harems. Peasants in black veils, dark Italians Greeks, Spaniards with silk mantillas, are always here. Also the two types of English the wowser in tweeds, flat heeled, flat footed, and goggles and the spare smart aquiline officer's wife type. The bazaars are fine full of stuff that would make your mouth water from jewellery to carpets ? lovely brass urns, and bowls etc. The carpets are a dream. Streets streets of nothing but prostitutes from black ones sitting like monkeys behind barred windows to smart French women lounging at the doors. I avoid the lot ? they are killing heaps of our chaps. 
The atmosphere reeks of sex here and revolts the senses. In Australia you are all calm, holy, wowsers, to these folk. Everything is openly suggestive. In the back streets one relieves oneself in public, or rather the niggers do, and no takes any notice ? just like a dog. And the smell ? Oh God!
