 I went up and saw Mr Greenwood, and he had about 5 Tons of Copra which I bought at the price telegraphed to me. I also saw Whitten Bros. but they had none on hand at all, either to sell or to ship. Messrs C.R. Baldwin had a small lot of 5 tons which they have shipped to Sydney, and this and B.P's Copra was not taken on board till our return from Yule Island. 
 We left Moresby at midnight on the 27th Oct, arriving at Yule Island at 7 a.m. next day. A. Gabriel came on board, and I bought 3 Bags Copra from him. The tally of cargo here turned out 2 Cases Kerosene short. 
 Sister Patricius was a passenger from Yule Island. I was informed that the usual proceeding there v was to issue a ticket for people of the Mission who travelled by our steamers, and the Mission would be debited by Head Office for the amount of the passage. Acting on this, I issued a ticket to Sister Patricius, stating on it that the cost would be debited to the Catholic Mission.
