<p>a great view.  Last week I had no visitors whatever, it was a bit slow.  Since then I have had a stream of old ladies in.  Mothers of the other officers, jolly nice of the old dears to come in.  Next week a whole family is coming in.  One day a very nice girl bowled in, said good day &amp; sat down &amp; talked to me all the afternoon.  I said to myself, you must think I am someone else so said nothing, talked on.  Found out she was a friend of my sister.  I hope you win something at the show but for heavens sake don't fall off, it would cause such a stir, getting washed out at Manly would not be in it.  Am looking forward to a swim, no not a bit of it.</p>
<p>My family are all coming over very silly of them as the cold will drive them mad &amp; they won't [indecipherable] it a bit.  This letter will I hope do for an answer to John's as I really have no news &amp; bed is not the place to collect it.  Tell him he will have to alter Graham's war cry a little, he may remember what he told me it was.  The snaps are splendid.  Will now close &amp; remember me to old Mac.</p>
<p>love from<br/>Stuart</p>
