<p>Nov 10th  Beautifully fine day but place is still muddy.  Shelling is not severe &amp; very few casualties have arrived.  A German aeroplane brought down in flames a few hundred yards away.  Living comparatively well.  Nights are now drawing in &amp; it is dark from 5 to 6.  Baupaume is distinctly visible &amp; seems only a couple of miles away.<br/>Nov 11th   Still good weather.  Shelling not too severe though Fritz livened up this afternoon &amp; night.  A raid by a party of bombers failed &amp; everyone of the party were wounded or killed.  We had a trip to between trenches for a patient.<br/>Nov 12th   Last night was very busy &amp; we had three stiff carries a piece.  Shelling more severe than usual.  The part we went to between lines was just in front of Guedocourt wood where there is a dug out in our occupation.  Jack Tweddel has died of his wounds.  Baupume up to this morning has not been bombarded but now the tower is missing &amp; the bombardment of the place has commenced.<br/>Nov 13th.   Move back with the division to Longueval again   Relieved by the 4th Division.  The illumination mentioned on the 6th inst was caused by a successfull raid by German planes on a French munition dump.  Damage &pound;1,000,000.  Percy James has been mentioned for work done in the stunt a few nights ago &amp; Blondon &amp; the W.O. have been decorated by M.M. (2nd for ?)  Heavy shelling last night.  Coming out this morning I noticed some men getting "tanks" ship shape, oiling, etc. so this with the fine weather lately seems to portend another big move.<br/>Nov 14th  Awoke this morning to hear all the batteries in the dist in action.  The heaviest bombardment I have heard since Pozieres.  It transpires that the German line was taken in places and the ridge (commanding Baupume) &amp; three villages have been taken &amp; are holding.  Prisoners are coming in.  Our plat. was shelled as usual to-day &amp; three men killed.</p>
