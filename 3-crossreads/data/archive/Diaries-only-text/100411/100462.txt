fortnight. Back to Villers Brittoneux [Villers Bretonneux]. Up there a week got cracked in the ribs. Went right back to C.C.S. operated on piece of shell taken out, part of two ribs part of liver. A decent left swing. Put in 6 weeks at C.C.S. too crook to move then to Transport on coast. Sister at C.C.S. very good to me.
A week or so at Transport then up to Havre across to Southampton. From there train to Bristol. Put in 2 weeks there during which time I got up a few times in a chair. Then to Clevedon V.A.D. where I spent best 5 weeks ever. A proper home. Could shot a rock into sea from Hosp. nice esplanade. From there to Dartford London, 8 days there. On parties nearly every day, Theatres, dances, etc.
