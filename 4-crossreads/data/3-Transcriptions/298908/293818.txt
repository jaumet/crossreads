<p>my eyes &amp; jumped out of bed.  The maid brought me in hot water &amp; I had a shave &amp; was dressed in no time &amp; down like a shot to breakfast.  After this was over Mr. Duke took me round to one of his friends place Mr. Shelley, the Town Clerk &amp; we had a yarn there for a couple of hours &amp; then we went for a stroll round the promenade &amp; then back to dinner &amp; more arguments.  We get on remarkably well the old chap &amp; I, &amp; talk over all sorts of subjects.  He is one of the finest men that I could ever wish to meet &amp; before leaving him this afternoon he insisted on me taking &pound;10 to help me on my way &amp; he said I was not to trouble about paying it back any time would do.  He offered to lend me any sum but I would not hear of it, its alright having a friend like this over here for you never know when you might be pushed for money.  Before leaving I gave Miss Sparks a pair of my field glasses &amp; she was delighted with them.  Its not much for all the kindness they have shown me while in England.</p>
