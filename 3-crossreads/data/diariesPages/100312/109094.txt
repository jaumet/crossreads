20/10/17 Paris
Hot bath. The water is on today. Went by tube to Concorde and did the gardens of Louvre Tuileries but there was a heavy fog and they did not show to advantage. The flowers and fountains here must look very well in time of peace. The statuary as usual very fine. Passed through the courtyards of the Louvre to the church of St Germain from the tower of which sounded the death knell of the Hugenots so many years ago. Inside the old stained glass windows, a few worshippers and the smell of musty old age. Returned via the Grand Magasins du Louvre to the hotel and met. E. going for a walk up the Champs Elysees through the same places. Returned by tube and then went up to Webers meeting Padre Lamble Sandford
