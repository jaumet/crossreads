<p>[22nd May contd]<br/>purchasing some sausages found a classy eating house &amp; had them fried with eggs &amp; chips and the whole went well.  At first the people didn't want to cook it as today was a meatless day throughout France.  Stroll around for a bit thence return per boat to Pont D'Achilles in time for tea.  Was surprised at the number of new marquees (duly disguised) &amp; stretchers about the place.  There was a pile of stretchers about 12 ft high &amp; 20 ft long.  We were lucky enough to get an ambulance on way back Charing Cross and safely negotiated the road to this part of front and it has been evident that a push was in preparation.</p>
<p>Recently our guns have been peppering Fritz &amp; messines &amp; it is almost impossible to sleep in the lines.  A.M.C. work has been hurried on new R.A.Ps (not very solid) new A.D.S. &amp; the colossal M D S at Pont D'Achilles at which there are 6 ambulances (9.10.11.4.12.13)  all point to activities soon.  Our aeroplanes are particularly busy and live over Hunland some even descending almost on the trenches.  We have to sew our brassards on &amp; a green ribbon to denote 9th Brigade and all these things</p>
