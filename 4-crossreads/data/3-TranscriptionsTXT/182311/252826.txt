 From &quot;The Laundries&quot; Erquinghem near Armentieres the billet of the Raiding Battalion of the 10 th  Brigade, A.I.F. 
  FRANCE . 
  11-2-17.&nbsp; Sunday . 
 My Dear People, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; It is Sunday evening and such a curious way of spending the Sunday that I must tell you about it. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; The morning was spent in Route Marching for about one hour, then in teaching the boys demolition s , by blowing up rails and girders, then on that afternoon a church parade and at three o&#39;clock we were free, several of us wheedled some revolvers and ammuntion from our Adjutant and off to a range to improve ou t r shooting.&nbsp; I&#39;m getting quite a skilful with my Webley, its a big bulky weapon, with quite a kick, but by jove, it&#39;s a grand thing to use and its big leaden bullet not only stops a Bosche but knocks him down, then the big children (us, I mean) indulge in a game of &quot;kick the tin&quot; on the ice which has now begun to thaw. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, the weather today has become more mild and where yesterday we walked on frozen chunks of earth, today we slop through shallow mud for the thaw has commenced and the first couple of inches are wet. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I received quite a nice lot of home letters in the last mail, two from&nbsp; each. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; So Billy Cooper has his commission in the artillery, good for Billy.&nbsp; Just here an interruption occ-urred, for one hour I&#39;ve been lying out on a xxxxx shed  roof watching the splendid artillery cover for a raid made on Fritz&#39;s trenches by some Scottish neighbours of ours, and now that this bombardment is over, I can hear the mutterings
