<p>May 30/17 Wednesday Basieux<br/>came on here a few days ago to stop with the C.R.E while we are out here spelling. &ndash; 'Jock' Barclay &amp; I got a pass for a days leave in Amiens for Monday. We got hold of our passes the night before so set off Sunday evening &amp; walked down to Buire 5 miles away so as to be ready to catch the early morning train in</p>
<p>Got a camp for the night at Buire Baths &ndash; our camp consisted of a borrowed great coat each</p>
<p>Got into Amiens about 9.30 a.m &amp; had a good day, sweltering hot great to be amongst civilization &amp;</p>
