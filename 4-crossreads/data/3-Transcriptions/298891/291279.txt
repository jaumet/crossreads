<p>Wakened by 3 a.m. by the noise of disembarkation. Breakfast at 6.30. Stood around to go aboard a couple of [indecipherable] till 10.30. Said good bye to Capt &amp; officers of ship &amp; others. Paddlewheel broke then ropes broken &amp; we stood in that sun packed like herrings &amp; finally got onto the wharf about 2 o'clock. C.O. alert to the last sent us bumping up to S.W.H. in a motor lorry. We got down town to see Flochers &amp; report to B. Red Cross &amp; then Dr Bennett brought me up with her in Ford car to Ostrova when we arrived sans adventure at 1.45 on Monday morning to find that a sister had died at 9 in the evening.</p>
