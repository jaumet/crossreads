<p>24/4/19<br/>Wiesbaden<br/>Up early and caught train <strike>to</strike> at Wiesbaden with Gorman &amp; Miles to Mainz. Saw them off from the station and then did a round of the streets. It was raining and rather unpleasant so one's impressions of the town would not be the best. Still it seems much dingier than many other towns we have lately seen. The bookshops in Germany are very attractive and the books beautifully bound. Went to Mainz Cathedral which dates from 1000 in parts &ndash; inside it is dingy and not very good except for one or two good carvings of statuary. On the other hand there is an unusual lot of 16th century skeleton horrors. Had lunch at the French Officers Club and then walked up to the station ready to go to</p>
