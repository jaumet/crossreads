  
 Wednesday  9 July 1919  Very laid back today. Went to Belgrave Eaton Place but they can't help me   Some rush today. A real bonny warm day. Went to Eaton Place. Got a paper there & went to St Georges Sq. from there to Horseferry Rd clothing depot then to Regency St. then back to the Road then to Gt Peter St. for my pay book. They couldn't fix me up till 2 pm so went away & had lunch with Bill. Took my trunk & valise to Paddington. Went back & got my pay book then we went to the Army & Navy Stores & got a pocket book. Janet gave it to me for my birthday. We had ices, strawberries & cream & a drink there too. Bill then went out to tea while I had a rush to get my train. Got a taxi OK for the camp. Reported at No 2 Group. Allotted to No 4 Mess. Had a feed & got a bed. Met one or two I knew. 
 Thursday 10 July 1919 Warm again today. Went to the doc, & got my papers made out. Nothing else to do all day. Went to the Y.M. & had both morning & afternoon tea. Some excitement I don't think.
