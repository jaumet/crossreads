is a fairly large town which has a number of houses which have been destroyed by the Germen guns a week or two ago. Noeux Les Mines seems to be a coal mining centre, a big number of the houses etc have also been destroyed. It is only a mile or two from the "line".

The team which our unit team played was the 2nd. Tunnelling Corps, the latter team winning. They have a splendid Mess Room accommodation. It is a tunnelling corps but they can show the A.M.C. unit how to look after their men.

This village had ninty bombs from aeroplanes dropped into it one night not so long ago.

Singing and jollity ended the day except for a occasional member vomiting his inside out having indulged as usual too much beer.

Reached back to the C.C.S. a 7 oâ€™clock.
