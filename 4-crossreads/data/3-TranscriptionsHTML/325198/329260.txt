<p>3 March, 1916<br/>Serapeum<br/>This is the worst place I have ever been in to do any writing, the tent is always crowded &amp; it is so windy &amp; dusty that it is almost impossible to write in it.  To night I am writing down at the canteen it seems a bit quieter here &amp; there is a good light &amp; a seat.  These last two days have been particularly windy &amp; the sand gets into every thing. I don't know how much of it we must eat with our food. We have taken our dinner out these last few days &amp; indeed it is much better than having it in the tents as we dismount for dinner where there is a bit of a break in the desert &amp; it is not so bad.</p>
