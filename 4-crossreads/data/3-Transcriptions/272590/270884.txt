<p>1919<br/>Aug. 20<br/>anchored off Williamstown.  We moved into the wharf at 8.30 a.m. stirring up a lot of yellow mud greatly to the delight of the N.S.W. troops who escorted their Victorian brethren to the side of the boat, so as to point it out to them and enlarge at the same time on the beauties of "our harbour".  The Victorians disembarked about 10.30 a.m. and marched away from Port Melbourne up to the town.  We had an early dinner, the last meal on board.  The Tasmanian men disembarked and went across the wharf to S.S. Frankfurt, which was waiting for them.  We moved off at 1.30 p.m. and stayed on the wharf.  It was a fine big structure with three sets of rails, and wired for electric trains.  There was a fatigue party wanted for something or other, but Don McKinnon gave me the good oil about it</p>
