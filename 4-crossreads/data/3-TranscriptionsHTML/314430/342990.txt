<p>Something, indeed, to be able to show to her  - I confess I felt proud to be able to do so &ndash; the spoils of war; and I pointed out to her some of the longest guns, saying, "these were captured by Australians." It was saying a good deal, when one looked upon that huge mass of captured cannon, ranged before the proudest palaces in the world.</p>
<p>December 3rd :- Furlough concluded today. Reported to Convalescent camp at Sutton Veny, near Warminster.</p>
<p>December 15th :- Walked in the Churchyard of the Sutton Veny church, and there saw the graves of many <strike>deceased</strike> deceased Australian soldiers, marked with the usual humble White Wooden Cross. Many another churchyard in Wilts has received the bones of men of the A.I.F. These will be abiding links between the villagers, and the far country whence they came, and will become sacred spots for all time.</p>
<p>December 25th :- Christmas Day. The ground is covered with snow, but the sun shines brightly. After breakfast I went for a long walk, alone, through the fields. Bells in the villages of Heylesbury, Sutton Veny, and Longbridge Deverel rang Joyously, and brought to my mind Cooper's sweet lines:-<br/>"How soft the music of those village bells<br/>"Falling at intervals upon the ear<br/>"In cadence sweet! Now dying all away,<br/>Now pealing loud again, and louder still,<br/>Clear and sonorous as the gale comes on.<br/>With easy force it opens all the cells<br/>Where mem'ry slept."</p>
