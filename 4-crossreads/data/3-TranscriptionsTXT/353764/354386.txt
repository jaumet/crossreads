 Gurkha Troops came in to-day, which means that there must have been a fight down on the Canal. There is nothing much of importance to report here, as Heliopolis is very quiet. To-night as I sit on my bunk, I think of home &amp; everybody, &amp; wonder when I shall be back again. The War does not seem to be near its end, &amp; no one ever thinks of it out here.  It is only when one thinks of Everybody they left at home, that you feel lonely &amp; miserable.  Such is a Soldiers life. 
 24.1.16 Rained very hard &amp; nearly flooded us all out.  A peculiar thing of the storms we get over here, is the rapidity in which they rise &amp; then go away again. We purchased a good Piano to-day for the boys (on the hire system) &amp; have placed it in our Mess.  They are all over there Singing now &amp; appear as happy as can be.  It is a marvel what music can do to brighten up things. Still not much news of the war.
