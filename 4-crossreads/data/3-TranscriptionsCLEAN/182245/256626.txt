 APRIL 1917 
 21 SATURDAY 
 Fine & fairly warm. Cleaning 
 harness all day. I turned 
 my two horses out to grass 
 for a couple of hours. The Right 
 section & Staff played the 
 centre & left sections football 
 in evening & the centre & left 
 won by six to nil. Got 
 a couple of papers from home.
