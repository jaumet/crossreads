<p>1917<br/>March<br/>6 am.   We took the short road through Burcombe but made slow progress owing to the roads being slippery with ice.   We reached Wilton station just in time.   The train, (carriages nice and warm this time) landed us at Waterloo station London at 10.10 am.    We stepped out of the train and it felt like stepping into an ice chest, although there had been no snow.   I had to wear my overcoat every time I went out, both day and night.   We went across the street to the Union Jack Club and booked rooms for two nights to see how it went.  We were very hungry, having had no breakfast so had some. &ndash; porridge and bacon and eggs.   Afterwards we went to the basement and had a haircut.   We had an early dinner and started off down the street.   We had not gone far before we discovered that we were walking away from the city so turned back.  I bought some metal buttons for my tunic.   I wanted to get my Australian Notes changed for "Bradburys" so, after going over Waterloo</p>
