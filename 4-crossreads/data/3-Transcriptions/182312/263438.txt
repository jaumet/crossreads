<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The conveyance of the wounded from the battle field to</p>
<p>Hospital in England is a record of efficiency and tenderness from</p>
<p>beginning to end.&nbsp; In my case after being carried in from No Man&#39;s</p>
<p>Land by a stretcher bearer who came out in broad day light and under</p>
<p>fire to do it, I was carried on a stretcher about two miles down the</p>
<p>saps to the Battalion Aid Port where my wounds were dressed by the</p>
<p>Regimental Medical Officer Capt. C.N. Smith, late of Manly.&nbsp; His Aid</p>
<p>Port had come in for a good share of the shelling the night before</p>
<p>but fortunately had not suffered a direct hit.&nbsp; Having had my arms</p>
<p>free during the night I had been able to apply the first field</p>
<p>Dressing (which which every soldier is supplied) myself and thus</p>
<p>keep the wounds clean and help to stop the bleeding.&nbsp; This undoubtedly</p>
<p>is a great help and lessens the work of the Medical Officers.&nbsp; From</p>
<p>the Aid Port, still on a stretcher we went to Contalinaison where a</p>
<p>Dressing Station had been installed in the cellar of what had once</p>
<p>been a chateau but is now a heap of rubbish.&nbsp; Here a staff of</p>
<p>Doctors were busily engaged passing patients through.&nbsp; Five minutes</p>
<p>generally sufficed and after being innoculated with anti-tetanus</p>
<p>serum away they went by Motor Ambulance to Albert, about five miles</p>
<p>back.&nbsp; At Albert the same thing occurred only on this occasion a</p>
<p>proper hospital was available.&nbsp; In most cases the Medical Officers</p>
<p>just take off your bandages, say &quot;Oh Yes&quot;, put fresh ones on and</p>
<p>as you are carried out, they add &quot;Hope you have a good time in</p>
<p>Blighty&quot;.&nbsp; They have a cheery word for everyone which, when xxx one</p>
<p>considers that they have been working day and night for goodness knows</p>
<p>how long putting through hundreds of patients each day, is very</p>
<p>commendable.&nbsp; At Albert I had a meal and then went twelve miles in</p>
<p>a motor ambulance to Corbie on the Somme above Amiens.&nbsp; At the</p>
<p>clearing station at Corbie the patients are sorted out and those fit</p>
