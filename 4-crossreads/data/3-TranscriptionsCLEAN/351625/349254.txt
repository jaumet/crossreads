game is no fun. still  A few boys from Australia wont make any difference to the war now America is in & you will all be needed in Australia in the near future, so whatever happens dont come till after you are 19.  The weather here is getting quite warm now, the winter left well behind thank goodness, we had our share of it during January up to our knees in mud or else slipping all over the frozen ground
