<p>Mena Camp<br/>30th March 1915</p>
<p>Quite a while since last I wrote to you Im afraid but I must plead the exigencies of the Service to clear myself.  Well it really looks as if we are to move out of this god-forsaken country.  One Brigade has already gone, the Lord knows where and to-day Sir Ian Hamilton inspected us.  He is a grissled old soldier and has a withered arm.  Small-pox broke out in our Brigade and that has delayed us as we cant leave the country under 21 days from the date of the last case.<br/>We buried a comrade a few days ago, he died of pneumonia this is the first death we have had.  The day after his funeral</p>
