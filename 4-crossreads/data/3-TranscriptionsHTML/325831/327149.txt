<p>Hospital<br/>Birmingham<br/>4.1.1917</p>
<p>Dear Uncle Dowell,<br/>In this letter I hope to tell you more of my doings in France &amp; Belgium, &amp; particularly of my meeting with Tom. I wish I could send you news of Cousin---her letters are as brave &amp; interesting as ever, but so far we have not met. I am longing to hear that Tom is on leave, &amp; am daily expecting to. Both Cousin &amp; he may be able to visit me here.</p>
<p>Since I last wrote a new doctor has practically promised me the use of the left arm&mdash;two others had sentenced it to a cramped &amp; stiff existence. It will probably mean my going to "Highbury" (Chamberlain's Home), which is now a hospital a few miles from here. You can imagine how pleased I was to hear his opinion, on which I am building great hopes. It is bound to be a slow business, possibly a couple of months from now, a "Wait-and-see" sort of existence.</p>
<p>When I rejoined my Battalion, they were in billets near Poperinghe, having just been relieved from a section of the Ypres salient. I was sorry to have missed seeing the scene of so many struggles, though at night it was possible to follow from where we were the Salient's outline, because of the flares which were constantly being fired. Old friends told me the enemy had been very quiet there, he seemed short of guns, but had abundance of trench mortars, which are just as unpleasant for infantry. Our Battalion had carried out a raid, which was a complete failure, no damage having been done to the enemy, while we had lost several good men.</p>
