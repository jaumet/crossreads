Saturday. My dearest Mother  &  sisters. I have received such a lovely lot of letters  & papers. One from Belle, Ethel, Ella, Mrs. Barrie, Mollie, Jess, Miss Maggie Mackenzie, Miss D. Swinburne, Mrs. Copp  & P.C. from Marion also "Messenger" from Mr. Copp. Mrs. Roddick, & Argus, Una, Australasian, 2 Bulletins &  Punch from Mr. Osburne  I think. I have not received any letter from Terang yet. but the mail is so uncertain I may get another packet to-night. Did I tell you we had rather cool weather in the Red Sea. Oh, it is a lovely trip through especially at night by moon-light & I was fortunate enough to be on night duty.  Well, we arrived at Suez on Thursday-night, came by train to a station a few miles from Cairo reaching there about 9.30. p. m.  Had a very hot journey through the great desert  & a dust storm but we all spent the happiest time since leaving Melb. All Victorian Sisters, Major
