We came home about 8 oclock &amp; then went down to the Orderly Room, but could not find the list so I took the opportunity to write a letter, after an hour or so a chap came in &amp; I asked him what about the Dental list, why they are here he said &amp; fished them out from under a water jug, they had been there all the time, luckily it was only a short one so I was soon finished for the night. 27th.  Soon finished my job this morning for on Saturdays they don't have so many men to run through.  Looks a little clear this morning but I suppose it will rain again
