It cannot be Jamaica &amp; we are on the wrong course for Simonstown. It's either England or Gib. We expect the latter. It's getting hotter. Must add one or two stories of Falklands action. Rescue boats put off, &amp; approaching, bow man yelled as he threw the rope "Here, you blooming sossidge! Put this d__d rope round your (Shavian) neck and I'll haul yer in".
