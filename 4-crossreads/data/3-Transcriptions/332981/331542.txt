<p>December 10th 1918. Tuesday</p>
<p>After writing considerably about important events which has happened since the Armistice was signed, I now make a few notes of what concerns me.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon Nov 23rd I received notice to prepare to leave for Vron on Monday 25th &amp; take up the duties of a Blockman in Vron West Cabin, as it is quite a change or rather a relief off the engine for a while and especially during the winter months. On Monday 25th  at 8 am I took my stretcher &amp; kit bag over to the line along with a number of Australian boys who also were going up the line to relieve the Tommies in different Cabins  who were going away towards Cambria &amp; at 9 am along came the engine &amp; van &amp; all hands put their kits &amp; stretchers on &amp; in a few moments we were away.</p>
