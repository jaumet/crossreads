little pain with the actual incision, but the soreness is increasing and arm is beginning to swell.
Concert in evening by Ship's crew, but so crowded I did not go. Every square inch of room was occupied; every beam and crane and rail were covered with men in all degrees of undress attire. Wrote "The Wanderer". Bed, deck, 9 p.m.
Sunday, 6th:We passed the point, 60 miles from Cocos Island, where the "Sydney" dashed off to fight the "Emden". Church Parade 10.30 a.m. Sermon on the Syra-Phoenician Woman. Not suitable for troops and yet restful and inspiring to me and my mood---and perhaps to many others. We do not see anything of the Chaplain during the week. He is one of the Censors and has plenty of that to do, but why shouldn't that be split up between the Officers and let him come and have a yarn with the men? He is an old chappie, ripe in experience no doubt---and though I think a younger man is more fitted for the work, an old man is not without certain advantages, if he would only use them. Bed 10 p.m.
Monday 7th:Weather warmer still. Say cloudy, and atmosphere muggy. Have been at letter writing most of the day. It gets so wearisome because one cannot say half that one would. Writing is brim full of expression when one has time to translate the mental pictures and the emotions and sensations that one has---but it is perhaps a shallow vessel at best.
