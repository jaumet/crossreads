<p>round, I considered myself sufficiently cleansed &amp; dashed out, collected clothes &amp; got.</p>
<p>We went to the occupied beach &amp; <strike>went</strike> swam with the others off a punt, when the beach became shelled &amp; every 2 minutes we had to get under the pontoon: only lasted &frac14; hour &amp; then the freshness of the water repaid us for the unfriendliness of the Turks. I wash my clothes in the sea here &amp; consequently do not have the nuisance of "reinforcements" &ndash; one of the politest terms on yr account.</p>
<p>The date I am writing on is 3 days after the school children's festival that Father Kelly dislikes (not allowed to say it right out). On that particular day, had the most extraordinary day I've ever put in &ndash; The Turks for the day or two previous had been seeking an armistice to bury their dead &amp; as the trenches were almost unlivable in, to say nothing of the beautiful mountain air passing down our valley, I am very glad it was allowed.</p>
<p>At 7.30 a.m. they ceased sniping down this way &amp; I went up to our post of the week before &amp; climbed out on the ground in front of our weak end, where we lost the 14 men in one day killed. This had never been walked on since the heroic landing</p>
