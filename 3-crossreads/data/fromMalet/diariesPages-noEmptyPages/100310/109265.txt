11/8/17 Rouen 
and write this sitting near an open window. The river and wide quais are in front and busy traffic on the water. Beyond there is a background of white fleecy clouds and some distant woods. Went up the street and then returned to dinner at about  to 8. Not many in the restaurant ? some English officers and a French family or two. Some of these affect the filthy English habit and bringing dogs in to dinner. Opulent (siens?) perfume were the two chief points about the young French matron near me. Prices high. 12fr for dinner. How some of these English officers manage on their smaller pay I don't know. Some of them are on Base jobs elderly paunchy and alcohol up to the eyes. They serve liquers here in a glass about a little more than half the size of the ordinary wine glass and on top of a bottle of Sauterne and a Perrier, a benedictine was rather heavy. Circumnavigated the Cathedral by night ? it looms up black and silent the footsteps of passers by tread the same cobbles that have been there for ages. Returned to hotel and started to write but drowsiness was such that I just threw clothes off and turned in.
