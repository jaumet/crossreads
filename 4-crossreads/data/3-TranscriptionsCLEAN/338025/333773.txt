  
 Wednesday 22nd August 1917 Dickebusch Harnessed and moved out by 8am. Went to Spoil Bank (nr. 18lb gun pits) for a load of old ammunition (18lbs) and brought it back to dump at Dickebusch. On the road up we passed great number of naval and other heavy guns. You may drive past a hedge or a thicket and never dream that it masks an entire battery so cleverly are the guns masked. Another trip to the same place in the afternoon finished about 6pm. 10pm Tube over with lights but he returned very quick as our guns got on to him.
