 part of soldiering over here - we three sigs on C. Sqdn station are camped in a little gully and its just like being on a picnic party. We are absolutely left on our own and are our own bosses so in the day time one runs the phone and reads or writes, another one cooks and tother one takes the horses down to the river to graze and has a swim and we take it turn about on these jobs. At night we have two extra men in to work shifts with us on the phone so there is not too much night work! By Jove its a great life and a peace camp will will hurt I&#39;m afraid when we have to straighten our saddles and sleep with our noses in line etc. The last camp back in Richoa was good though - we played football there most of the time and everybody rather looks on it as our home from home I think. There does not seem to be much news this time Mother so I&#39;ll stop. Love to Father amd Hal and Fred. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson
