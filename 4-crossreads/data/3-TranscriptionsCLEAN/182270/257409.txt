Fine & calm. Sighted land at dawn
& got into Albany at 12.18 pm & dropped
anchor in the Sound. It was a very
poor homecoming for the Western
troops as there was not a soul
to meet them. They were taken
off in barges & put into quarintine
for three days. We got away
again at 6 pm. About 740 troops
got off - over half the number
on board. Got a wire from
home.
