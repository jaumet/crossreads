<p>Bushey Heath where D.W.A had her abode.  Had tea &amp; supper out here &amp; pleasant evening, returning to town about 11 P.M.  Made arrangements for tomorrow.  Sent off a cable to Sydney announcing the fact of my being on leave.</p>
<p>Sunday 1st Dec,  Wet morning.  Did some writing &amp; then went along to Piccadilly tube where I met D.W.A.  Had lunch at Slaters &amp; then walked down to Pall Mall in order to see the arrival of Foch, &amp; Clemenceau, Baron Sonnino &amp; Orlando.  They passed in the Royal Carriages, first Duke of Connaught with Foch, next Clemenceau with Lloyd George then the two Italians.  They each received a splendid welcome.  The route was beflagged &amp; the huge crowd which lined the way gave the typical British welcome, a long &amp; throaty cheer commencing in the distance &amp; travelling</p>
