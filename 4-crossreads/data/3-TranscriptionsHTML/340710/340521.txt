<p>why one feels the break.  However Im useless for six months and Ive got to go and Im now looking forward happily to the sight of the dear old place and people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother left a few days ago for Salonica, I saw him off from Paddington on a troop train crowded with men going out to do their bit.  The train moved out slowly leaving misty-eyed mothers, wives and sweethearts waving frantically to their soldier-men and then it disappeared.  The crowd turned and wandered forlornly out into the seething streets of the great city, here and there one saw the look in a woman's eyes which her soldier-man would never see there, the look she hides behind a wistfully smiling face, back they go through the streets of London to their homes to wait for- God knows what.  We have nothing with which to express this, the French would say "C'est la guerre."</p>
