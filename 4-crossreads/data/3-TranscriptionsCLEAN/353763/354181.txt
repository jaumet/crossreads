  
 going to hold a few Court Martials  -  Time was passing so we 4 left for the Boat  -  We found a short cut & then - when back in town - decided to call on the officer's (military) club  -  The Submarines are a thirsty cunning crowd & what they don't & wont do isn't worth worrying over  -  We called & asked for a chap who we didn't suspect of being there - but he might have been  -  He wasn't - but some officer asked us to have a drink  -  He was a colonel & then there was another chap Maning - I'd been introduced to his brother the day before & mentioned the fact  -  Patterson sat next the colonel & talked in his usual fluent manner with any amount of submarine bad language - as if he & the colonel were twins - I must say this - the colonel didn't turn a hair - He hadn't much  -  Well we had drinks & after a bit as I was the Senior I thanked the Colonel & said we must get on board  -  This mess is at the German Club & a very fine building
