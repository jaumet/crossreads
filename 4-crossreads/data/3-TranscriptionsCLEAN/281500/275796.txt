  
 from the Bombers and myself, he started to talk about something that did not concern him in the slightest, however one thing led to another and the Bombers who by the way think they are some class at drilling threw out a challenge to drill any platoon in the Coy., before the words were hardly out of his mouth Len had accepted it, so he fell his platoon in & the Bombers done the same then Capt Jacobs stepped forward and said he would give 25 francs to the winning team and 3 judges were selected from the "Machine gun section" who were with us, they tossed and Jock Mackie won it. He elected to drill after no 11.  So Len started off and the platoon went through their drill and done it well, real well considering it was sprung on them by surprise
