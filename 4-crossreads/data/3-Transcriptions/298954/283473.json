<p>1917<br/>3rd June<br/>Certain stewards are permanently assigned to <strike>those</strike> our tables &ndash; the only difference with the crew is that each man takes his turn as "peggy", as the steward is called.</p>
<p>The "Wairuna" was brought alongside the raider this morning and the work of plundering her commenced in earnest.  We were allowed up on the poop deck in the afternoon:&ndash; coaling planks &amp; baskets were rigged between the two vessels &amp; a big coaling party had commenced to transfer coal.  I obtained permission to go on board the "Wairuna" to "bring over my personal effects" (which had already been passed over by my steward.)</p>
<p>However, I managed to give the "tip" to those on board to bring over all the food possible, &amp; also managed to plunder a bundle of towels etc. from the linen-room.</p>
