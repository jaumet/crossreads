<p>4<br/>Well, you will by the time you have got this, have received from Mr. Boehme in London, notification of the fact that I have borrowed &pound; 7 from him. The reason for this is that my pay book being full, was taken from me &amp; sent to England to be audited before a new one could be issued, &amp;, as the rotten law is, no soldier can be paid without his book. Consequently being out of the line, &amp; the change of buying some decent food I have been borrowing. But I hope the allotment will cover things alright. I don't know how much the insurance &amp; other things amount to, but by the end of a years allotment I think things should be square, if not before. Of course I am living on 2/- per diem now, in fact we are only paid 40 francs (&pound;1/8/8) per fortnight, which doesn't go far towards some decent meals in the expensive land.</p>
