in Australia & in Victoria Hall, Manly, gave the same show here.  There were no girls of course, the whole of lady part of the show being impersonations.  Bo-Peep was lively & everyone was in love with Her (Him or course).  It was a magnificent show.
We are working on heads like old Nick- to get Home.  We'll wangle it yet & if we are not Home for the July sales I'll eat my Hat.  Nothing exciting
