<p>Glad you gave me your exam results.  They are jolly good and you ought to do all right in November.  I will be thinking about you, and wishing you all sorts of luck.  (Hope you will be able to read this, my pen has run dry, and I can't write with a frowzy pencil.)</p>
<p>Sorry you did not get my letter about being wounded.  I have it all in the diary however which you will see some day.</p>
<p>Laughed when I read that Mother's friend, the Folly-Pointer had taken over the Salon de Luxe.  She's a fair goer.</p>
<p>Mother has written that you are just it, Mick since I have been away.  Keep it up son, and you will make me feel happy with regard to the Mater being looked after well.</p>
<p>You have probably heard about our advance on &amp; around Aug. 6th.  I will not give any details as you will probably have read of the doings of the 13th Batt. ere you get this.  I was fortunate enough to have taken part in the big operations, and had a fairly exciting as well as a trying time.</p>
<p>No more news.  I have received letters from Kath Begbie, Myra, Enid Chandler</p>
