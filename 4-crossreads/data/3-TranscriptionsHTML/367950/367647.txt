Theres not to reason why "- I am now putting in all spare time on to the study of shorthand (Pitman's) I find with the amount of writing I have to do I am at a serious loss and where I particularly noticed it was at the School of Signalling at Zeitoun where I had to do such a power of writing when taking notes that ordinary longhand was quite inadequate for the purpose so I decided that after I had got through "David Copperfield" that I would <u>not</u> read anymore books until I had as Dickens put it "Tamed that savage beast Stenography " All my signallers have developed the Bridge playing habit very badly so much so that they " must finish this hand " before doing anything they are asked to , must make an alteration in that way very soon. I hope soon (DV) to put everything down in this diary in shorthand instead of the laborious longhand which is such hard work . It will mean a minimum of space with a maximum of information.
