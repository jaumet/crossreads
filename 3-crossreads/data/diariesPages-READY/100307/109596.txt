"D" Camp Mametz
30/3/17
Showery and cold. Battalion moved down to D Camp at 10 am. Astonishing the amount of rubbish that comes to light on a shift and particularly annoying is the dumping of government property blankets ammunition etc that so often occurs. Some fool put a Mills bomb in the incinerator and caused a big explosion. After everyone had moved out inspected the lines and left a very clean camp to walk down the road to a place where 24th had left. A similar camp to our old one but left in a dirty state. 
After lunch all the newer N.C.Os fell in and with Alderson, Archer, McKinnon W.O. Caldwell we tuned them up to some purpose in word of command smartness of movement etc. Drilled on a green hill side which had been shelled once ? a deep trench ran across it and shell holes and empty cartridge cases told of very bloody battle. At the foot of the rise was a small cemetery of German graves "Here rests in God" is their favourite inscription
