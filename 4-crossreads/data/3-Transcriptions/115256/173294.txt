<p>Thursday 4 February 1915</p>
<p>To-day, complying with the issued instructions as regards the new infantry organisation, the Battalion was reformed into 4 companies and sixteen platoons.  After the old order of things, this seems very strange, but I daresay we shall get used to it very soon.  My new section commander, although he is a very decent fellow, is, militarily speaking, an ignoramus.  So I am feeling very sore about going on active service under a man who knows such a lot about his job that he gives the order "For inspection, port arms" from the "Present arms".  It hurts, I can tell you.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the officer commanding the division to which the Fourth Infantry Brigade is attached, General Godley, officially opened the Y.M.C.A. building which has been constructed in close proximity to our camp, for the convenience of the troops.  In a short but appropriate speech, the General referred to the good work of the Y.M.C.A. both in Egypt and Australia.  This building, he continued, was especially of great service, as it would do something towards keeping the troops from playing the fool in Cairo.</p>
