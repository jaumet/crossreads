 My dear Judge, I have nothing fresh to tell you since my last letter we are still in this very happy home with a great many creature comforts and very little attention from the Bosche. 
 I have just completed a shift from 1.30 - 4.30 AM & am just being relieved. I have managed to clean up most of my letter writing troubles, the only interruptions being from a horror of horrors known as the field telephone. These are generally in code & take some little time to decode. Apart from them the night is as silent as can be. This place is the quietest I have been on & will suit me admirably until the cessation. 
 I shall now go and pull my relief out of his warm bed. 
 Am very fit Best Love Yours affectionately C R Lucas
