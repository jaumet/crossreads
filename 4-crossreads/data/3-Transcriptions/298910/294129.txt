<p>Thursday  5th 1917</p>
<p>Relieved at all Posts by 1st Division &amp; their Ambulance. We marched back to Bapaume &amp; stopped the night at the Main Dressing Station. Had a good nights sleep &ndash; also hot tea &amp; stew. Dull day, but fine. Saw a Taut brought down.</p>
<p>Friday  6/4/1917</p>
<p>Dull day but fine &ndash; Packed up all our Amb stuff &amp; it nearly broke our hearts to learn that instead of going for the Divisional spell which has long been promised us &ndash; we have to set to and build a rest station between Beaulencourt &amp; Bapaume. Had rather a heavy day.</p>
<p>Saturday  7/4/17</p>
<p>Raining &amp; snowing. Rigging tents etc, more horrors etc. At 6.30 pm a mail was announced &ndash; what a difference it makes to a blokes spirits &ndash; I got letters from Annie &ndash; Eileen &ndash; Jess Hagan &ndash; Lill &ndash; Kit &amp; Gert &ndash; Maud Single &amp; papers &amp; letters from Mabel Evans. As our mail is still closed cannot write at present. About 7.30 pm muster parade of Bearers, were advised to go to bed for rest as we would probably be called out to assist the 1st Field Ambulance about midnight, needless</p>
