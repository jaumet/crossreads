  
 Friday June 15th I am in the "Soft" squad here, we knock off work half an hour before the "hard" lot, both in the morning & afternoon. We get very decent food now, They shifted us to another cook house & the O.C. personally inspected the food we were getting, therefore the above result. Paid this morning 30/-, being about 3/- overpaid. The weather is getting very warm now, I have discarded all my winter clothing. 
 Saturday June 16th We haven't done much drill today, Went to an asphysciating gas parade, we were to go through the gas, but owing to so many, & us being the last, we hadn't time. Met Jack West accidently in the canteen. Talking over old times etc. 
 Sunday June 17th Went on church parade, all the protestants went to the church of England. Very quiet in camp. There was no reveille this morning, so we had a good sleep in. 
 Monday June 18th Raining nearly all day. Fell in 8 am & after a lot of unnecessary bothering about, we marched to Parkhouse Camp, a distance of about 5 miles. Things haven't altered much since I was here last year, most of the old staff is still here. Put in No 6 hut. There are a lot of fellows here who haven't  seen field service yet, They seem anxious to get over to France, & get as many tips as they can. Raining to heavy to drill this evening. Had our records taken also particulars of previous service.
