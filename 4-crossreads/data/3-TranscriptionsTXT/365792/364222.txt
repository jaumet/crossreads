 May 17 Went to short sing song &amp; service (C of E) &amp; rather enjoyed it. 
 18 Had a chat to Sister last night &amp; then straightaway slept until the Orderly woke me at 5 am &amp; wanted to wash me. Guess I can do that little job myself. 
 Went for a little stroll to the head of the lane &ndash; The Channel lay- shrouded in a thick fog blanket, through which issued at odd intervals the roar of a fog horn from an incoming liner. The sail of a fishing smack, the Pier-head &amp; a few scattered rocks close inshore were dimly discernible. &ndash; The night orderly looked rather hard at his slippers this morning, because don't you see, I pinched them last night. Going to England tomorrow, so hope the sun keeps shining. Today has been glorious. A waterplane just slipped in from the Channel, dipped lightly into the water &amp; thence into the Harbor. They'll be having aerial submarines soon.
