After a spell of an hour, we both made another attempt to secure the Tarpaulin and prepared for our journey back, after doing the necessary oiling and Shunting we left for Conchil at 1.15Pm with 60 Covered Empty Vans and our 3 Ration Vans, and  now it was more pleasant as we were running Engine first and the Wind was easing off a bit, after a good trip we arrived past the Depot and away to Conchil reaching there at 3-15 Pm and after stowing our Train away returned to the Depot and signed off at 4.30 Pm after a rough journey, in fact the worst trip I have had in France, & we were not sorry to finish, the weather now was grand. The Wind & rain had all gone and it was pleasant with promise of fine  weathe  few days as the pressure had worked around from the North West to North East.
