 The fiery reservoir that rides the vault A spendthrift spending ever yet unspent Upon this earth man's floating tenement  With life deriving showers makes his assault  With life imbuing light makes his assault Transmutating With the properties  of transmutation charged  imbued He spreads the coloured galaxy below The dull hued earth crops forth in  goodly  painted show  From bankrupts nought to beauty's wealth enlarged  And floral vestments clothe the barren nude.

Distant firing showed that the battle was not all over but we did not participate; and after waiting a couple of hours marched back to camp. We had only our overcoats and rubber sheets. It was pretty cold during the night and twice I got up and walked around
