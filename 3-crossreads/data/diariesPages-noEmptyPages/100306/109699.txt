high. Evidently of the prevailing chalky soil it is well torn about by shells and 6" hows. were bursting on it while we watched. The 18 pounders were on to Warlencourt and the observer would get "Gun fixed" by phone before we heard report and then we would have plenty of time to wait for the shell to arrive and burst. Yesterday the same guns got right on to a party of Huns and blew one chaps arm off and others were evidently wounded as they all ran away some holding their limbs. Returned to own H.Q. for lunch and got busy on plans for raid. Relieved 23rd Battn in evening, quite uneventful except that our runners did not know the way too well and machine guns were flicking bullets well into our trenches. All complete by 9.30 p.m. rations came up alright. Our patrols went well over to hun lines and heard them coughing talking and working in their trenches. Left patrols reconnoitring ground for raid but have no reports from them. Turned in about 11 and slept sound.
