Sunday 8 August, 1915
Visited Mena hospital met Cecil Watts. He is stationed there. He finds it a bit slow.
Had a ride on a camel & donkey, took some snapshots.
Spent the evening listening to Military band in the park.
Went to see the "Kursale" again for the express purpose of hearing a certain song sung by a French girl. I could sit & listen to her singing all night.
