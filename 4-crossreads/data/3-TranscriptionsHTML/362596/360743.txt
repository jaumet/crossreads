<p>France  7/5/18<br/>My Dear May<br/>I received your very welcome letter of 15/2/18 and I was very pleased to hear form you, but May I can't understand why you have not been getting my letters as I have written a lot to you since I wrote the one in French but it seems it must have been a failure perhaps it did not get passed the censor.<br/>Well May we have been having a very busy time of late fighting old Fritz but of course you will be getting all the news on the papers. He has retaken all the ground where we had such hard fighting but never mind we will beat him in the long run and his casualties have been very heavy. Our machine guns play havoc with his troops they cut him down like a hay crop and that is the stuff to give him.<br/>Well May in Mother's last letter she told me of Muriel's wedding it</p>
