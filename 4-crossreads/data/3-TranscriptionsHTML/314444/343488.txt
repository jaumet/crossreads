<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>Just a few lines to let you know that I am getting on fairly well. I have been in here since the 11th inst and I am leaving for England in a few days time. I was wounded on the 7th inst. I had a bullet through the thigh and a piece of shrapnel in the calf; the wounds wont heal in this climate.<br/>I got a very pleasant surprise when I heard Horace was on the Peninsula I went straight over to see him, and he looked the picture of health. He told me he had left Sydney without going to see Ruby. I was angry with him for when a fellow gets on that Peninsula he is lucky to get through safely.<br/>We had a good chat together and the following afternoon I saw him again and we had a swim together too.<br/>The next day (7th) we were in action and it was a terrible fight. I was wounded after about 4 hours hand-to-hand. <strike> Then</strike> We fairly tore the Turks to pieces. I have learnt since that Horace was alright and doing well. I only hope he remains so I have written him since I have been in here but I have not had a reply.</p>
