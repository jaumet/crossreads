<p>Bulford<br/>17/2/19<br/>My dear All,<br/>I am just a day late writing home as I have just come back from London after 3 days which I had made very happy being the first leave since arriving back from France. Since being away Harry has received 3 letters from home but as usual is out I believe at the washerwoman so poor Saddie cannot answer any questions which you may want to know, but I shall answer then in a few days.<br/>First of all I arrived in London on Friday noon when I went straight away to A.I.F. H.25 to see if I could hurry up my return home to Aussie really during my time on this question I really saw quite 10 officers of various ranks from Lieut. to Generals but my great sorrow and disappointment could absolutely get no understanding only that my C.O. here has said on my papers that we cannot be spared at present and they cannot overrule his decision, which has made me mad with temper  to think just because he says no I cannot get away. So all that I can do is wait which is making me very unhappy. So after leaving H.25 I went to see the firm to see if they could write in again and claim me.</p>
