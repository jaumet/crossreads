<p>3rd May 1917 Victoria Coffee Palace Stanley Street Brisbane.</p>
<p>"The shouting and the tumult dies<br/>The Captains and the Kings depart."<br/>The roses have faded, the long journey ended &ndash; and we are indeed home at last! What a long journey, what suspense at times!<br/>We landed at Melbourne on Anzac Day &ndash; a most appropriate time I thought &ndash; and we had a magnificant reception from the citizens of that city. We were cheered and hurray-ed from Port Melbourne to the Red Cross home just over the Flinders Bridge. We were granted leave immediately up till 11 pm. The long sea voyage being over and the excitement of the reception and the roar of traffic in the streets made my head giddy and I for one was glad to get into a nice comfortable bed.<br/>The next day we all paraded and <strike>about 45</strike>  were taken in</p>
