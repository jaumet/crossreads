<p>&amp; if we are going to be relieved by the 2nd Division I don't envy them their job, they wont have it quite so hard as us for we had to take the position &amp; consolidate it.</p>
<p>26th. Last night about 11 oclock we filed out &amp; I think everyone breathed a silent prayer when they got clear of it, I know I did for I never expected to come out alive the 17th Battalion relieved us, when we got out to the Gordon dump our cooks had hot stew &amp; tea waiting for us how we enjoyed it, God alone knows what a relief it was to us to be out in the clear ground again &amp; among the light; &amp; men.</p>
