August 1915Thursday 12Beautiful morning. An occasional shot from rifle and canon is to be heard. B. Coy in our Batt. was only able to muster 15 men after the charge. We are having 48 hours rest after doing 48 in the fire trench..
Friday 13Hot again. Turks heavily bombarded our trenches, but did no damage beyond burying a couple of chaps and raising an awful dust.. It is terribly fatiguing work in the trenches now we are all done up with our long stay in here and look forward to relief by the next Division.
