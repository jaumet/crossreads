All orders given in English which is spoken well by the S.M. & his Assistant (the latter speaks 6 languages fluently). These Scouts are distinguishable by violet neckerchiefs & are the best I have yet seen in Cairo. They wear English equipment & work on B.S.A. lines. Attended Evening Service at All Saints' at which I struck Willie Vane.
