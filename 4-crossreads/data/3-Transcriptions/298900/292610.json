<p>Gate for dinner after which I listened to good music &amp; had a nice quiet homely evening.</p>
<p>Thursday 10th Jan<br/>   Went along to S.M. &amp; Co. &amp; drew &pound;5 &amp; also left my souvenirs, 2 bayonets, 2 bombs, diary &amp; maps etc.   Had lunch at the Y.M. and wrote a couple of letters.   Visited Hugos &amp; Times Book Club having tea &amp; dinner &amp; NottingHill Gate.   Then went to see The Beauty Spot at The Gaiety.   The show was rather good but not quite what it was refuted to be.   Felt very downhearted all day at the thought of things in general so walked home to work it off.   Very successful as I felt better next day.</p>
<p>Friday 11th Jan<br/>    Spent the morning in the hotel &amp; met C. Price at 2 oclock at Euston.   Then had a busy time.   First had lunch, paid my bill at the Hotel, took a taxi to Horseferry road &amp; get the remainder of my Kit then on to Wilton Hotel at Victoria where we booked a room for the night.   I then ran out to Nottinghill Gate to say goodbye, had tea there &amp; met C.P. again a Piccadilly</p>
