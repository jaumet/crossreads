January 1st. New Year opens, finding us at Biesme some 16 kilos south of Charleroi awaiting our turn to go to Australia.
To-day a party of us went to the Field of Waterloo by motor lorry, seeing Quatre Bras on our way. The Lion other monuments the farms were seen, including the fine French "Dying Eagle Defends the Tricolour" Afternoon tea with some Australian nurses was very nice.
