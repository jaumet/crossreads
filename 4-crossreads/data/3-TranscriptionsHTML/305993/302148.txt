<p>own to Varna.  All the guns &amp; forts on each side of the Bosphoros are manned now &amp; could be plainly seen by naked eye.  The right side going out by the French troops &amp; the left side by British troops.  The Union Jack &amp; the tricolor of the French flying gaily.  It was a beautiful sight steaming through the Bosphoros, a sight which every one on board thoroughly enjoyed &amp; could hardly realize that we were in this particular part of the world, considering that so much fighting &amp; so much loss of life had occured such a short while ago.  The Katoomba passed us in the Bosphoros bound to Constantinople full of Turkish returned prisnors.  We have some splendid snapshots of sights whilst steaming through.  The German Cruiser Gobden [Goeben] we find has been moored 36 miles from Constantinople in the Sea of Marmara since her disaster whilst out of the Dardanelles &amp; when she returned after sinking the Raglan &amp; another monotor at Mudros.  She was run ashore in a sinking state &amp; got off &amp; kept away from the City so that the Turks could not see the extent of the damage, now manned &amp; surrendered to the British.  At Constantinople we were moored alongside British Battleship Casear several cruisers &amp; torpedoe boats also a Greek, Italian &amp; French fleet with all their guns trained on the different parts of the City in the event of trouble.  The Germans of which there are thousands are gradually rounded up</p>
