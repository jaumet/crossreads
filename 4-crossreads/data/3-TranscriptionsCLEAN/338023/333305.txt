My Dear Mother,
Look at the date above and then, remembering that I am within about five miles of the frozen desert we lobbed into on a certain morning of December, imagine just how joyful I feel about it. Also how the rest, the straggling rest, of the old 4th/9th feel. The other day all the best of the boys with only three or four exceptions, marched elsewhere. Gee, I felt bad when they went off - there are just as many behind, nevertheless the place seems empty to all of us 'originals.' The new crowd - well, enough said. The fact remains, the poor "specialists" having the honor to be such, cannot go. Apart from the above grouse I have 'nowt' to say against things in general. We are being fed as never before in the past six months. We sigs etc have the best end of it in this respect - to'ther night a large tin of "dinkum" Australian Cracknel biscuits

found its way into our hut. Some treat, let me assure you!  Also we get plenty  little concessions, notably in matters of dress. In fact I'm more than ever glad the job came my way - for its worth it if only for the fact that it leads to one ceasing to be altogether a numbered ticket in a bunch. After all, the biggest argument against the militarism (against which half humanity is fighting) is that it crushes all individuality. I don't fancy you would like this place now - a little while ago the landscape was a blaze of rainbow colors, but the flowers go ooh, fast as a good old north coast thunderstorm, leaving behind the old monotonous green that marked the early spring up north.  Down here the green is accentuated by glaring patches of chalk that dazzle in the sun - an unholy sort of combination for the eyes.
