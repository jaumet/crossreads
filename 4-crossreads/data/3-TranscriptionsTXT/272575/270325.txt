 Nell. C. has sailed for Australia so Dott. told me in her letter.  I suppose She has arrived home long ago, I was in hopes I would see her in England, but it will be some time before I see that side unless Fritz send me a free ticket, and does not overdo things.   I dont think that I am particularly anxious to go there, if I knew someone, or had a few friends there, it would be very different, no doubt if I did go over I would manage to enjoy myself, but I will not worry over that till I get there, life is too uncertain here,  One of our lads was killed yesterday, when he was standing in a  place where he seemed perfectly safe.   A Ricochet bullet got him, I must close as news is far from plentiful.   Love to all, heaps for Bett and Yourself from your Loving Son Chas. My Love to Bea and thank her for the present.      it has not arrived yet.   C.
