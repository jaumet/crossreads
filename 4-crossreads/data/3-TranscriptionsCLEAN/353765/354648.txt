Had been spkg to Bob. not a minute before & hurriedly left him to get into cart. Cart was not more than 50 yds away. Moved out further, outposts in touch & intermittent rifle & art fire on our front. Inf attacking & met with some success. Plently of rumours but nothing definite as to what was done.18th - Returned to near Wadi about 9 pm. Rough road & dust too thick to see a yard ahead.
