<p>for this and indeed many times during the journey the little French dictionary purchased in Cairo was very useful. We already had a large Union Jack that one of the officers had bought with him but wanted the red white and blue to put with it. At a well-stocked stall we obtained the daily papers and put them on one side to be read when the light failed.<br/>Leaving Dijon amid farewells from the people gathered on the station we found that the line now took a bend in a general NW direction and followed the Canal of Burgoyne for the first hundred miles as far as Laroche. A few miles out of Dijon we passed through a fairly long tunnel, the countryside generally being of a more hilly nature than previously. It was, however, being&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  utilised to the fullest extent. Copses, woods and forests in which many clumps of mistletoe were seen were more common. Piled on the outskirts of some were bundles of faggots sawn by hand, longer bundles of stakes for grape vines and numerous other bundles of the slender sucker-growths of elms, poplars etc. which by these careful people were saved for burning indoors. Steep slopes were terraced to allow of the land being used to the fullest extent, and stones had been laboriously picked off the surface and placed as low walls along boundaries. On one of these terraces was a girl with a shawl thrown over her shoulders industriously hoeing between the grape vines, but able bodied men were still conspicuously absent.<br/>Gradually we passed out of the vineyard country into the land where cereal crops predominated instead. In the sides of the railway cuttings was again noticed the economical idea of cementing in slabs of stone instead of tiles or bricks. Up on the crest of one of the hills, overshadowing a village nestled in the valley below was a large statue which with glasses we made out to resemble the Virgin. It was a reminder of the religious tendency of the country.<br/>We had seen no sun during the day and as the time passed it became colder and the French sentries were more frequently to be seen occupying their straw sentry boxes, structures that somewhat resembled thatched beehives. A number of these by the way, were seen in one of the gardens of a house near the line. Village scenes similar to those already noted were repeated again and again and as the Union Jack and French flag together were waved to the people, caps were raised and sentries saluted. Most of the cottages were small and in one place were built into the hillside, but there were also some better class houses even 3 and 4 stories high, with a high pitched roof but no verandah.<br/>By nightfall we had reached Tonnere and after fixing things up with the men, slept soundly in anticipation of a heavy day ahead.<br/>During the night before reaching Joigny we left the canal of Burgundy and followed the Yonne through Sens and Montreau, where we left it for the valley of the Seine. This was traversed through Melun almost to Paris, and at daylight when we woke a signpost indicated that we were only 3 kilometres from Paris.</p>
