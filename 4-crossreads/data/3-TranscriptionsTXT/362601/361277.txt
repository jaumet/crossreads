Go to Ottos's for plants. Ida & Nat come down & kids. I take 'em all paddling in creek. Gee they get in a mess. I dig & plant all day.

Dig & plant all morning. We go to Dee Why in afternoon. Meet Geo Lil & Myrtle. I am very quiet. I am better after [indecipherable] & watering my garden. Amuse Dad & Mum until nearly 9 pm.
