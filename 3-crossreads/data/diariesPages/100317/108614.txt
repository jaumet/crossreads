4/7/18
Colonel Sadler 17th Battalion marched in to our relief and our companies moved up to Banana Swith Villers Trench. The General moved some of the 24th further forward for use in case of counter-attack developing. Some Americans hopped over with our 4th Division today and did well. Hostile aircraft heavily bombed the 17th coming in but caused no casualties. The relief was all complete by m.n. and I tried to get some sleep but not very successfully. This is the rottenest attack of illness that I have had for some considerable time. This dugout is 30? under ground and hewn out of damp chalk everything soon becomes dank and moist. No chance of getting better here. On the front a quiet night. Sent up some parties to bury the dead. Owing to crops some will not be found for days
