<p>party of four leading, then myself  and another about 50 yards away &amp;  had not proceeded more than half a mile when bang went a shrapnel shell bursting just behind the rear man of the four, one of our stretcher bearers, &amp; severely wounded both legs above the knees, the bullets flashed past me on either side a special providence saving me from hurt. I rushed up &amp; rendered first aid &amp; whilst we were doing this, a second shell landed within five yards of us in the water fortunately not exploding rather a warm reception for a start. I &amp; 3 others then carried him a distance of about 2 miles to the main Ghurka Hospital where the major spent 3 hours on the wounds. By a wonderful chance the main artery was not severed although fully exposed but several muscles were completely severed. With great care he stitched the muscles together making a splendid job of it &amp; one which will evidently save him his leg. It appears that when we took our man away the remainders started a wee panic which discovered that we should return to Cape Helles. They appeared to become quite demoralized by the occurrence. Just as the doctor</p>
