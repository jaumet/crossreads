<p>Get my Kit Bag  &amp;  new set of brush gear having lost mine as well as boots, puttees, overcoat, etc. We got out here * about 1pm  &amp;  had dinner, were sent to various wards   &amp;  then have a look round. It seems to be a very easy going place, very few restrictions   &amp;  about a quarter of a mile from the largest Pyramid which is immediately in front of the Building</p>
