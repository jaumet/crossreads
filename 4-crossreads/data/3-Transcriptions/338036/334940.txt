<p>24th Aug. contd]<br/>Saw plenty of Portuguese en route and on arrival at Lumbres found the place fairly large.  Paper factory was a large building but didn't have time to inspect it.  The railway station was fair size.  Saw many of 1st Div Pioneers who were quartered in the town &amp; also the British Butterfly Div (19th)   Rather a pleasant surprise came when we saw a lion cub in a garden attached to the Divnl H.Q. and later on when we witnessed a tennis match by girls from the local convent.  Later we saw the train from Boulogne arrive and was pleased to see some English YMCA girls on board &amp; they sent some papers over for us.  Then we caught the midnight railway back to Ouve.</p>
<p>Saturday 25th<br/>We received orders to move again today from this area (11th Brigade) into that occupied by 9th Brigade.  Our billets allotted at a small village called Eseque [?] near Thembrionne  [Thiembronne] which was about 5 kilos from<br/>Faughemberghes [Faquembergues] on the midget railway.  Major Williams had our packs forwarded by car &amp; therefore the march &ndash; tho it was hot &ndash; was a pleasant one &ndash; the boys whistling the while.  On arrival we found the billets rather scattered and B Section had to walk perhaps 600 yds to meals &amp; parade.</p>
