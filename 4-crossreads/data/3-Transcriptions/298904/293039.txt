<p>into my arm here to drive the poision out of my system. We had several very fine concerts here one of them was a beauty &amp; there were some very fine artists there I was down in Helouan several times there are one or two very fine hotels here, mostly tourists patronize them, but theres very little doing while the war is on.<br/>On the 20th Len came out &amp; fetched  me a bunch of letters &amp; papers he was down on leave from Tel-el-Kebir for 24 hours so he did not have much time to spare<br/>A few days after this I was one of a party of 7 [?] patients &amp; about 10 nurses who set out for a picnic</p>
