<p>from the Admiralty stating particulars of a "Naval Battle" in the North Sea, and which was gibven out as follows:- "Two very fast, and heavily armed German raiders attacked a convoy in the North Sea ,about midway between the Shetland Islands and the Norwegian Coast on Oct 17th. Two British destroyers H.M.S. Mary Rose (Lieu Com. Chas. L. Fox) and "Strongbow" (Lieu Com Edward Brooke) which formed the anti-submarine escort, at once engaged the enemy vessels, and fought until sunk after a short and unequal engagement. Their gallant action held the German raiders sufficiently long to enable three of the merchant vessels to effect their escape<br/>It is regretted however, that five Norwegian, one Danish, and three Swedish vessels all unarmed, were thereafter sunk by gunfire without examination or warning of any kind and regardless of the lives of their crews and passengers"  Lengthy comment upon the action of the Germans is unnecessary, but it adds another example to the long list of criminally inhuman deeds of the German Navy. what</p>
