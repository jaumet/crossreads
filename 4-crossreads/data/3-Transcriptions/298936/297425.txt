<p>September 1915</p>
<p>Sunday 26</p>
<p>Rose at 5 oclock &amp; went to Holy Communion at 6.</p>
<p>There were only 3 there but I felt the benefit of it.</p>
<p>Had a curious dream last night.  Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hart, Bobby &amp; Rita were washed out to sea &amp; I saved Rita &amp; Bobby but could not reach Mr. &amp; Mrs. Hart.</p>
<p>Rita must have been thinking of me a lot today for I feel she is close to me.</p>
<p>Left camp at 7.30 carrying pack on back, blankets &amp; waterproof &amp; also black kit bag, marched 4 miles to jetty, only to find we were here a day too soon so had to march back again ( left kit behind and went to village in evening</p>
