  
 [newspaper clipping] S.M.H. 23/3/16 One of the finest descriptions of the evacuation of Gallipoli by our troops was contained in a letter written by Lieut. Garling to his father, Mr. Garling, of Angledene, Lane Cove River. As the story has been already told in print, Mr. Garling does not intend to have his son's letter published. It is worded in a clear, straightforward style, telling what happened, and the miraculous success of the plan, with a vividness of which the sincerity brings the actuality of the scene before the reader. Several of Lieut. Garling's letters home have been sent to the Mitchell Library.
