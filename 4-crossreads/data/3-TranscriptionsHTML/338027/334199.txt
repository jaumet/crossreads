<p>Wednesday, 23 June, 1915<br/>We had a pleasant awakening this morning by a sergeants voice &ndash; Come on get up you all have to be on the jetty at 9-30 so go on to the Scotian for duty.  Every man jumped up and we got the stores etc down in record time, a torpedo boat towed us over and we hauled our stores up by hand this finished we sat down to the best meal we have had since we left the Southern after dinner we had to put 200 mattresses &amp; pillows in slips and prepare beds as we expect a lot of wounded on board, this was hardly done when they commenced to arrive, and without a hitch they were promptly attended to, fed, and put to bed.  As usual my luck caused to be on night duty first night.</p>
<p>Thursday, 24 June, 1915<br/>Wounded and sick kept arriving all day in batches of a hundred at a time, we worked like niggers, as soon as we got one lot fixed up another 100 or so would arrive, just about meal time we had to feed them and then do the washing up, it was just Hell, talk about the parable of the fishes and the multitude, it was nothing to this, there were twelve of us to feed 800 odd all ravenous and they got three course dinner at that.  We worked up till nine at night when we received our last batch of 60 bad stretcher cases, by the time we finished with them our legs &amp; feet were just aching, I had done 18 hrs without sitting down, we sailed at 10 p.m. &ndash; Thank God.</p>
