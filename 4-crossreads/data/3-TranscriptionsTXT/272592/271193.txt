I cut my finger (little one) pretty severely today on a piece of tin & tonight it is very painful & hot hope it dont get bad on me, I also have a heavy cold in the head but Thank Goodness it has not settled on my chest
You wouldn't believe what a difficulty we have in keeping any thing here for the rats, the place simply swarms with them, & they are so bold that they will scarcely get out of your way, they tear great holes in your blankets & eat your clothes & equipment, even while you are lying down in them of a night, & when you are sleeping they simply run all over you
