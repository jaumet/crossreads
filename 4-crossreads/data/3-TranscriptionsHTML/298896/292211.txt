<p>reached there at 8.30. Had a breakfast of 2 rolls &amp; coffee &amp; entered the Casino sharp at 9 oclock. It was very grand &amp; I visited all the tables, the private rooms, seeing some of the tables in motion &amp; the theatre again. 'Twas very beautiful, ceilings painted &amp; decorations etc first rate! Next went into the Hotel du Paris, the grandest in the place. We then took the Funnicular railway to La Turbie a height which overlooks Monte Carlo &amp; the view was magnificent. An old Roman town here was very interesting &amp; traces of the fortifications could be seen by which thus part was prepared for any invasion. An English nurse we met advised us to visit an old Monastery at Larghet so we walked to the village &amp; were well repaid for our effort. The church was covered with crude pictures representing accidents etc from which people had escaped &amp; their faith in the virgin was thus demonstrated. They were extremely funny &amp; we spent an amusing half hour</p>
