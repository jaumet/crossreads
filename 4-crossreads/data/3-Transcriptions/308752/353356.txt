<p>right over the German lines. Probably giving signals to our Artillery. The airmen were often given a warm reception, shells burst all round them. A few shell caps from these shells fell near our dug-out, so it is best to keep under cover when these exciting events take place. Some of the chaps collected a few shell caps &amp; are keeping them as souvenirs, they are rather too heavy for me to carry about, the pack is quite enough.</p>
<p>3rd August 1916.   A very quiet day 5 p.m. The Germans have been continually shelling a house which is about &frac12; mile from us. The place must be an observation post. It is now a mass of ruins. It was a grand sight to see the shells hurl portion of the house, scores of feet into the air, counted 35 explosions altogether. Met an old school mate of mine today &ndash; Harold Biden. All through the night our Artillery kept up a continual bombardment at the German lines. Just a small gift for Fritz, on the anniversary of the second year since England declared war on Germany. The roar of the guns was terrific &amp; sleep was out of the question. Gas alarm during the night.</p>
<p>4th August<br/>A busy day, we had 9 cases to carry to the road, A very strenuous job, a wounded man on a stretcher soon gets very heavy. Another terrific bombardment during the night sleep out of the question.</p>
<p>5th August.<br/>From all accounts the Ambulance is all split up. One section is at a rest station, &amp; another section is miles away on another direction. Whilst A Section is working in the trenches etc. 11 a.m. Took another walk down to the front line &amp; saw a great number of my friends who were on board the "Beltana", including Lieut. Zanders (from Neutral Bay Rifle Club). It was very quiet in the Front Line of Trenches, not one shot was fired by either side whilst I was there. Saw the German Trenches through a periscope. 7 p.m. A British Aeroplane has just been brought down, it landed about a mile from us.  The dirty swines</p>
