  
 15/9/17 Dominion Camp Slept in until late being very full of a catarrahyl cold in the nose and had breakfast in bed.  After that spent all the morning on odds and ends.  Young Smith reported back from leave and took over his intelligence duties again.  Received a big crowd of aeroplane photographs of the front very well done.  The great drawback is the absence of contours everything appearing dead flat.  The photography is not the easiest of operations as they have to come low.  A squadron of Taubes flew over early in the day and archies and machine guns were firing at them.  At 3.30p.m. three busses called for our advance party for the front line.  The band rendered a programme during the afternoon.  Paid the men during the evening.  An Australian paper mail in.  General Paton came over for a talk before mess.  Fritz' s latest is firing into his own pill boxes by leaving the backs of them thin.  Cursed again with hay fevery symptoms the doctor advises a douche but nothing seems much good.  Am taking the men in with 170 rounds S.A.A. 3 days rations and water and no greatcoats or any blankets.
