tea overlooking the quaint harbor, with its red tiled villas terraced one above the other like amphitheatre seats. Danby lies another 14 miles, and at 6 p.m. we caught another slow train. The scenery is theses parts is delightful, great rolling hills with a tiny stream ??The Esk" winding through the valley, and typical sleeping villages nestling amongst the trees or clustered on the hillsides. We are staying at a delightfully comfortable little Hostel with the Cognomen, The Fox and Hounds displayed over the entrance. It stands on the top of a rise with moorland and farmlands all around, an ideal Haven of rest and recuperation. And such food! Good clean
