<p>16-12-1916<br/>Snowing, very cold.  A few shells about.  10 horses gone to Vet. Section mobile.  The total number sent to mobile from this position is 50.  The poor wretches are up to their hocks in mud on the lines.  Never out of it, day and night, where ever you go, mud, mud, mud.  Spent 2 hours putting a set of shoes on one of our original horses, fell down three times.  Three men on the job, one holding, one propping him up, and the other nailing the shoe on.  The horses are that sore, all over, that to pick up their feet causes them pain.  Absolutely the worst job that I ever had, and to think that I am trying to battle through with it, God, the people in Australia don't know what we are putting up with.</p>
<p>17-12-1916<br/>Foggy.  Shells amongst the 3rd Bty. last night, scattered the feed heap.  Got mixed up with one myself this evening.  Went to get a duck board, shells landed near me, rolled me over in the mud, I done a duck.  Now he is peppering</p>
