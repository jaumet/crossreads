Rumor has it that a message has been intercepted & that they - the German boats - have a rendezvous at a Known point with some colliers & our ships are going to rendezvous at the same part  -  Wont the sparks fly if that rendezvous comes off?
Our job of work is to wait in Rabaul harbor - AE2 & the Destroyers are to guard the harbor  -  A period of waiting is at hand  -  I don't mind  -  I am also told they want a P.M.O. for these parts  -  I must look up that job & find out what the perks are  -  Would it be worth while?
Thursday Sept 22  - 14Yes - Things are as I said  -  The Berrima troop ship went out early  -  The Frenchman Montcalm has gone  -  The admirals are reported to have met & arranged things mutually  -  The harbor looks quite empty  -  The Aorangi & Grantala come up to the Pier on W-day morning  -  Personally I am astonished at the Grantala coming up because I understood that the less she came into contact with the shore the better  -  They've been here 10 days & not a landing party has gone off from her  -
