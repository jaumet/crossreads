<p>My dear Mother,<br/>We are having a splendid trip and I have hardly been sea sick at all and am always as hungery as a lion and my word! it is good tucker on board after camp fare; soup and pudding and all sorts of good things.<br/>I hope you got my letter posted in the harbour I gave it to Capt. Riley the YMCA man; he was awfully nice and held a little farewell service before we left and then shook hands all round.  All our letters are censored now and I am not allowed to give dates or names of places or descriptions etc. so cant give much news.<br/>I wonder when I will get your letters if they are sent on; I will send Mr D'Arlot my address.<br/>If you have telegraphed to Uncle Walter he might be able to see me but dont suppose letters will have reached him yet.<br/>I hope you did not worry at not hearing from me when you expected; you never can be certain at what ports a transport will stop at so you must not expect letters from every port that a mail boat will stop at. Suppose you will be home long before you get this. It is jolly cold here at nights and I always sleep in my Balaclava cap. I will write to Father &amp; Aunt K &amp; boys and then you can get all the news so be sure of getting some of the letters. Heaps of love Mother dear from your affection loving son<br/>Rob</p>
