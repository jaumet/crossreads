<p>home at Eastbourne and I to Brighton.</p>
<p>March 3rd  Really it is wonderful what can happen in a fortnight.  As soon as I enter my room I am greeted with volumes of news &ndash; Some good &ndash; some disappointing &ndash; those of us who are going to France are delighted of course &ndash; but 4 of the original unit are being left behind &ndash; Sisters Bell Rush &amp; McMillan are three of them.  Then two weddings to-morrow Sister Walsh &amp; my friend S Davis.  I am pleased to be back for her.  Matron &amp; I went to the wedding &amp; She looked perfectly sweet &amp; pretty in a nut brown Costume.  Capt Hogan had on his Top Service Coat &ndash; stained with mud &amp; looking as if it had done good Service on The Somme.  I fancy Stills must have asked him to keep it on for when I whispered how unique it was she smiled proudly &amp; said "Yes, isn't it nice Anne?</p>
<p>7th  I'm feeling off colour with a cold &amp; a persistent cough that makes me feel like an old woman.  And these terrible northerly March winds pierce through one at every corner &amp; the ward I am in is like a vault.  We have 108 boys in J &ndash; mostly Australian such dear things, &amp; how they do appreciate Blighty after the trenches.</p>
<p>March 14th  Twas inevitable I could cry at getting Sick at this Stage &ndash; for the fear of being left behind &ndash; but I have been in the Sick Sisters 4 days and it's a perfect haven of rest &amp; with the Sweetest of Sisters looking after us.  I have a companion in distress Sister Mary McIlroy &amp; its laughable the efforts we make to get well.  I take anything even Cod liver oil &amp; [indecipherable] &amp; pray for the blue sky &amp; the blurred sunshine &amp; Mary pathetically says "Oh Anne for a bottle of Condensed Australia".</p>
