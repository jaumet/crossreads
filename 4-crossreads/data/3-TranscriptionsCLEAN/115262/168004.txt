Saturday 25 August 1917.
Nothing much doing. Tonsilitis seems to be prevalent among troops off the desert. 5 patients went to Raffa this morning. 3 Br. planes above all day. No rations.
(The last few days a number of boats are to be seen on the water horizon every evening, apparently on their way to Port Said.)
Ammunisiton barges were being brought up this morning at no distance from shore, to the dump at Beelah 6 miles from here towards the line.
