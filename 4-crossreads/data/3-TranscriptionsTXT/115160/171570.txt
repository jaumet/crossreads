 Darling Mither, 
 It was at this town that I wrote and told you how I had heard a Scottish Pipe Band thrill both soldiers and civilians with their music. &nbsp;We were stationed at Brancourt, a few kilometres away, on that foward stunt. 
 We have joined up with the Section two mornings ago, and we are all billetted in a big hotel. &nbsp;We loaded for the Artillery on the 27th at Roisel, and came on to Fresnay-le-Grand where we put in the night. &nbsp;We set off next morning and picked up the rest who had just moved forward from away down near Abbeville a day previously. &nbsp;In a day or so they are going back again to where they came from, where we will be back to the Artillery. 
 The weather has been remarkable for its mildness, and excepting a day here and there of rain and frosty mornings of course, it has been quite sunny and mild during the day.
