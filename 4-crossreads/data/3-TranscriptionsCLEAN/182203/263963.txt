  
 only done 4 hrs in hospital. Suppose Dorothy  & I shall be on Duty next week. We have had a number of cases in hospital    &  the Major was saying that a number of the poor fellows would have had pneumonia  & most likely died, if they had not been nursed. We had two very bad pneumonias last week but they are going on splendidly now & shall go on with us. The others are mostly influenza &  suffering from Vaccination.  We had a lecture from the Chaplin on General French last week but could not hear him very well - one thing we heard was General French &  John Wesley. how they came together I cannot see. Oh, the old chaps name is Rowe, he was the minister of Perth. W.A. church & built all those buildings that made the ground so valuable, so he says. He knew the Harmers & said dear old Mrs Harmer was a "Saintly Woman." I did say her son had married my sister. He is an awful old    Woser .
