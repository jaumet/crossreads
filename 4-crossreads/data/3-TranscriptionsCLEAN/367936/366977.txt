  
 Friday 12 May 1916 Very calm day.  Worked up like thunder storm but we only had a little rain.  Went down to stoke hole and engine room in evening.  There are 4 boilers each with 4 fires.  We are doing about 111/2 knots per hour. 
 Saturday 13 May 1916 Usual work still very calm.  Slept up on top deck & had my air pillow pinched;  but did not mind very much as it was pretty badly punctured.
