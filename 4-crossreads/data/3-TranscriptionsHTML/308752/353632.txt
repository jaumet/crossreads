<p>as after travelling for two hours, the train stopped for 12 hours at Chaulnes. The train "crawled" through the old Battlefield of the Somme &amp; the usual desolate, &amp; dreary scene, met our gaze. As we passed the ruins, my thoughts flew back to those stirring days at Thistle Dump, on the Somme in November 1916. Little did we think then, of the great victory that was to be ours, two years later. The next important place passed was Murcoing, it was here that some hard fighting took place.</p>
<p>Cambrai was passed about 10 o'clock on the 28th inst. I was rather surprised at the size of the place, it is a fairly large city.   It had always been recognised by the Military authorities that this town was a very important place to occupy. I should certainly say that it was judging by the net work of railway lines encircling the town.  The country in the vicinity was a mass of shell holes, which told of severe fighting, the town itself was badly knocked about, but not nearly as bad as Bapaume. All who looked on this town possessed a feeling of awe as we thought of the awful loss of life that occurred in the recent fighting there.</p>
