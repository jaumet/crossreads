 Sunday 18th November 1917 
 Went &amp; saw Laura who is getting on well. Then I went &amp; had lunch with the Cottons, the wife going to some friends Capt. Riddles. Laura will be up tomorrow, she gave me your letter of Sept. 9th &amp; JOES, a long interesting letter of Home news. We are off tomorrow so post this. 
 With love from both to you dear little Mother. 
 We go by all sea route &ndash; P. &amp; O. from Tilbury Docks Tomorrow.
