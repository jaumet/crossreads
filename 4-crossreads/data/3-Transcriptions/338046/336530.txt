<p>1917<br/>June<br/>Myatt, the man who figures on the left of the photo was an Englishman.   He had a very queer diary in which he used to record whatever dream he remembered when waking in the morning.   He used to leave this diary lying about, and some of the troops who were not particular about other peoples property used to regale themselves on his dreams.   Collins, you will notice is getting a "middle aged spread".   In Liverpool he weighed 11 stone.   About this time he was 13 stone 7 lbs.   McKee was a Bible banging fanatic of some heathen persuasion -  Primitive Leghorn or something, and was always trying to ram his creed down anyone's neck who would argue with him.  Needless to say he got plenty of it.   Apart from that, he was a good living lad and very quiet.  He sneaked off to Ireland for his leave and got married there to some Irish lass of the same creed as himself.</p>
