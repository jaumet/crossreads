Fritz is to have no rest this winter, for the settled policy all along the front is raid - raid - raid.

    Well, I will thank you for your prayers and good wishes, I want them all and value them too.  I often think of home but it's a place in another world, where it is sunny and warm, and old friends cluster round.

    Well, with all good wishes, 
       HAROLD.
