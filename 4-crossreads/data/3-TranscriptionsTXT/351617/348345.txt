for our eyes running for half an hour we were O.K.
On arrival back at the trench we built a fire & made a petrol tin full of Bully Stew but it came out blood Red, owing to some Idiot peeling the beetroots & putting them in. Anyway we were too hungry for a hot feed to let little things like that worry us so we just "hopped in" and there wasnt much of that stew left to tell the tale.
Next Day we decided to have a shave, not having had one since leaving Bussy, and I was just going to get outside the trench to get some water from a shell hole, when a shell landed about 15 yds away killing 2 Artillery signallers who were going over to their battery. We hopped out & ran over but they were both gone beyond help.
Somehow I forgot all about the shave and decided to leave it till after the Stunt and we were out of the line again.
