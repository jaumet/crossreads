A Toast to the "Reliable" Man.
Here's to the steadfast reliable man
The man with the tongue that's true
Who wont promise to do any more than he can
But who'll do what he says he'll do
 
He may not be clever; he's often quite blunt
Without either polish or air;
But though its not in him to "put up a front",
When you need him he's always there
 
So here's to the man on whome one can rely,
And here's to his lasting success
May his species continue to multiply
And his shaddow never grow less
