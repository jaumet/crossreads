 There are lot of thing that I would like to tell you , but I dont suppos that it would be advis but one thing , " I think I may say without fear , " I am glad that I fail to get into the Artilleri , for sever reason . one of which is that I am too fond of hors , and just now they are have a rotten time up there , I piti them far more than I do the men . for they are in no way to blame for ani part of this hell and they are there , do their share , carri food , materi etc and follow their master , patient and trust , with shell burst round them everywher . it is piti to see them struggl through the mud , but , Its no use think over these thing we are away from them for awhil , and it as well to forget , as much as possibl while we can . and the paper at home will give you as much , and more news than we can .
