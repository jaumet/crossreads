<p>The various movements I have had recently seem to have put postal arrangements all to blazes for I have found out in one camp that letters came for me and were sent to another camp but on enquiries there I found no one knew anything about them.</p>
<p>Now I have written into the base where all letters undelivered are sent so I may yet get them</p>
<p>I want them bad enough God knows.</p>
<p>From now until further notice address:-<br/>Sgt. G.O. Hawkins<br/>C/o Major Wall<br/>Garrison Quartermaster<br/>Zeitoun<br/>Egypt</p>
<p>Tell our children that when I was at Suez Dog mastiff bounded up to me in the street and went about a bit with me in such a friendly way.</p>
<p>After writing that simple story for our children it seemed so natural to see dog mastiff.<br/>This is quite true a dear old dog mastiff met me there and seemed to try to thank me for writing about him.</p>
<p>I dont know when the third chapter of that tale will be written.</p>
<p>Do you know AL-LEIL will be able to write I mean Girlie AL-LEIL means 'The Night'</p>
