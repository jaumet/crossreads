 Dear George, 
 This is a Dinkum Photo that we took crossing to I. of Man. I developed this Film & print. It is raining like the deuce & this is my seventh letter besides doing all my House-work since 6 pm, I am wanting to go to bed. Ellis or Siddie as we call Him (Dave will tell you why) is fast asleep  I hope you are all well. Give my best wishes To all the Boys & Mr Love. I met Norm Smith, you know the swimmer, the other day. I was only with him for a few minutes as I was in a hurry to catch my Train. He had a Swim with Tod Solomons, All. Barry & Charlie Bell up near London somewhere. Tod is in Park House 3 miles away where we first went from Egypt.   Best love to all  Harry
