 My darling Eddy, OXOXOXOXOXO 
 We do not see so many donkeys here, none to rise, they, poor little things are worked very hard. Must try   &  send you a picture of some loaded up with grass etc. We see lots of camels, you will see by it how they travel along. Hope to get a letter from you this week. Fondest love   &  kisses to you darling. From Auntie Eadle   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.
