<p>1915<br/>Nov. 1 Mon.<br/>Meeting of the 25th Nov. committee to-night. We have lost 4 of the 7 original Committee members who have been detailed for duty away from the Unit.<br/>Great excitement !  Staff-Sergt. Statt, Private Sec. to the O.C, has been made a 4th Class Chaplain with rank of Captain. Is there any chance of promotion for me, I wonder?</p>
