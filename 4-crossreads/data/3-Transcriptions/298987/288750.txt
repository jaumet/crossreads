<p>Monday 25th March 18<br/>Unloaded some trucks this morning Moved camp in afternoon about 1 mile back to where the remainder of a Company are camped. The four of us managed to secure a dugout on our own again. It is a miserable little afair not nearly as good as the one we built at our last camp Managed to get hold of some good bunks &amp; have made  our selves quite comfortable Yesterday was quite hot today the reverse A lot of rumours that we have had a big reverse about Bapume. Hope they are untrue</p>
<p>Tuesday 26<br/>Went out at 7 a m in a motor transport. Very crowded rough trip. Started excavating for the new job &ndash; another M.G. post &ndash; It was a very clear day &amp; we had a good view over the Hun lines. Do not know whe we are working here in the day time as the Hun must be able to see us quite planely</p>
