30 March 1916 ThurI was awakened this morning by the noise of the fowls outside ye old barn-house. Six of us were ordered to [Steenburque] as a clearing station to the 20th Batt. Left Thiennes 10 am. in full marching order & arrived at our destination midday. At this place so far I have enjoyed one of the best days I have spent so far in the military. We have a motor attached at our disposal. The night time was occupied in visiting the different taverns where we sat till 8 pm.
