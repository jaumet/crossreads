<p>Last night and today there was intermittent artillery activity all along this front.</p>
<p>It was showery this morning but turned out fine this evening. There has been an unusually large number of our aeroplanes continually go over &amp; returning from the enemy's lines. Some German planes came over this evening and were engaged by archies &amp; by our planes. Two were brought down, but don't know whose they were, as the fight was a considerable distance off. I saw a paper this evening, the first since I left Winnezeele. The war cabinet has sanctioned a policy of reprisals, but the "Express" pointedly asks "When?".</p>
<p>I was lucky today and received one letter dated July 24. No 81 from my wife &amp; also 1 large packet of Tobacco, Havelock mixture, &amp; 1 tin flake cut aromatic from W. Curtis.</p>
<p>Saturday October 6. 1917. &ndash; (1160.).</p>
<p>I was again on picquet last night. No. 1. shift, from 6 to 9. The first picquet is very dark now as the moon does not rise to late, but 2nd &amp; 3rd picquet there is splendid moonlight, unless the moon is obscured by clouds.</p>
<p>The drivers were very busy early last night shifting the Q.M. stores &amp; the cookers to another site so as to be more convenient for the Battalion who came out of the Trenches, or rather series of shell holes, last night. The cooks had hot soup ready for them.</p>
