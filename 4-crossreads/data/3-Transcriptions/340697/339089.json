<p>desert at Tel-El-Kebir about 60 miles south of Cairo.</p>
<p>It is a very large camp here and preparations are being made for a long stay. We expect to see some fighting on the Canal where an attack is expected shortly. There is an old battlefield quite close to the camp. The battle was fought in 1881. We visited the field this morning and explored the trenches 29.12.15</p>
<p>We are on duty as despatch carriers at Army Corp H.Q. 30.12.15</p>
