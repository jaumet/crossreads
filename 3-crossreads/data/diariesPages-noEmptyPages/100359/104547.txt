pack up all our gear and get ready to move off to Ferry Post. Finished off long letter to Lill and posted it. It might be the last chance I'll get for some time.

Just before we started Bert Evans, one of our transport men got thrown from his horse and injured his back, so he was brought along as a patient. We got into Ferry Post about 5, on Sunday morning. We flung off out kits, grabbed our blankets and slept until about 10 a.m. when the sun and flies woke us up. Then we turned out and searched around for water, in which
