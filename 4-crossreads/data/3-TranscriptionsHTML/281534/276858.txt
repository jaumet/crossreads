<p>27/2/19 Marcinelle<br/>First thing round to the 22nd. and had a talk with Davis &amp; Gorman. Then went down to the 23rd. end of the billets on canteen business. There are many funerals here daily owing to the grippe and mourners and hearses are only too frequent. In the afternoon saw Griffin 23rd. discussed the scandal of their badly managed canteen &amp; put him on the job as an auditor. Some rain &amp; hail came on just before Miller and myself walked to Marcienne au Mont &ndash; fine houses up here and from a football ground an excellent view of all the factories of Charleroi belching out fire &amp; smoke. Girls working on top of the slagheaps shovelling coal &ndash; poor slaves. The 7th. Beat 6th Bde at football. Spent the evening with Dr. and Mrs. Mathys in conversation.</p>
