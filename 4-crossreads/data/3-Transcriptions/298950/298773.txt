<p>Now I will deal with the <u>Camp Life in General</u> after this disturbance.  As stated previously our housing acomodation left much to be desired off.  Their wher first 6 than 13 &amp; so as the Pris. wher interned the Governement build more Barracks.  So at the End of 1916 our camp consisted of 45 Barracks.  The space also wher acordingly enlarged.  The Ground space of the Pris. of War Camp wher about 60 acre in area at the end of 1916.  The totall Internees amontet to over 5000 persones.  Our Camp consistet of three Parts.  The Area wich contained the Barracks.  Another for walking exercise, genarlly called "Chicken-yard" &amp; a Football &amp; Recreation Ground.<br/><strike>Ams</strike> The Military provide Barracks build out of different material mostly Wood &amp; Iron, but all of the same design.  Experients-trial they build <strike>one</strike> two Barracks, sides being covered with Asbestos.  During a struggle between two Pris. one got axcidentaly pushed against the walls of one of these Barracks, &amp; needless to say, that he found himself inside of Barrack having gone "clean through the Wall" as the saying is.  For this "Lurk" the Military deductet 30 shilling out of the Culprits</p>
