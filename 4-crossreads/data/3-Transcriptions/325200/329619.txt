<p>as there lies between our farthest out post  &amp;  the objective a waterless stretch of 20 miles. So it will go hard with us if we are repulsed. Rumour says 2nd  &amp;   3rd Bgdes  &amp;  Camelry to attack 1st Bgde to be supporting force. So with any luck we may keep clear of it, anyway I hope so. This fighting job may be all right in the regiments but it is too cold blooded a job for your  [indecipherable]  in this open country without a scrap of cover.</p>
