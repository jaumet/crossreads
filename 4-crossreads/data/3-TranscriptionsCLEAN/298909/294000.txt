  
 as it is no small item to have so many troops laying idle here - Boat drill & physical jerks. Have to carry our life belts with us at all times. Very hot below deck, most of us running about in only shorts - no boots or shirt. 
 21/6/16  Wednesday 
 Rather hot - Yards & Yards of orders read out. Some of sneaked over the side & had a good swim - Capt Coppleson afterwards got permission for us to swim at our own risk. Capt Coppleson got up a Boxing tournament & I entered & got a man a lot heavier, he only had one hit, but it was a good un & my ribs are very painful if not broke - he threw in the Towel in the 5th as I peppered him from his chin to back of neck. There is some very hot stuff on board & I don't think I will venture further in the tournament. The Officers arranged a Concert on Deck for us. Still lying in Harbour - all sort of rumours. 
 22/6/16  Thursday
