<p>Dear Mother &amp; Father,</p>
<p>Have been on the move to-day, came to a ripping little hut camp but unfortunately have to move again to-morrow.  May not be able to get another letter away for a few days.  Everything is going on alright.  Colonel is still on leave.  I am bossing the show.  The Bn has stood the strain of me quite well so far.  Have been dodging about quite a lot lately.  Things are going splendidly everywhere round here.  If only Russia and Italy would stick a pin in themselves.</p>
<p>Best Love,<br/>Your affectionate son,<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
