The roof consisted of a steep main gable with two valleys running into two shorter gables so &ndash; and on to these gables the roof then ran to the other end from entrance in the form of a half dome.  The wall supporting the dome was filled in with lovely windows finished in the Gothic style, and ornamented with figures of Saints etc.  These windows appeared to form the background for a beautiful piece of work in an elegant framework and under this structure was a figure in the lying posture of one of their martyrs.  Of course a lovely pipe organ completed the furnishing of this church.  The organ was built on a gallery on the entrance end of the Church, but after all I am glad that God listens to us here in any place just the same as in the elegant Church, and sometimes I wonder if God is altogether pleased with all this elegance.  It is tip top, but I am afraid that the people's lives are not altogether in keeping with their lovely Churches.  Well, I am travelling in the train now and I do not know where I am bound, but we have just passed through Caestre, Croiches, Tuchel, Doullens.  We disentrain at Doullens at 2.30 p.m.  We leave 2.45 p.m. and march on through Bagneux at which village we halt for dinner at 4 p.m.  We leave Bagneuse about 5.15 p.m., then on to Candas, where we see the Flying Corps men, and arrive at Canaples at about 8.30 p.m.  March distance about nine and a half miles.  We are billeted for the night.  Retire about 10 p.m. and bivouac for the night and have a good night's rest.
