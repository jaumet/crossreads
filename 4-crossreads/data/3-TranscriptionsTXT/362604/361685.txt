was run out when only (3).  We won the match by 3 runs.  All our good batsmen got out for a duck & the M.U.G.S. had to make up the score.  I was in Salisbury on Monday at Mr. Edmond's Home.  Thursday I went to Gy. & returned last night.  Well, Dad, I've given you all the news & I must scribble a note to Mum & then go on Duty.  I am glad to Hear that you are all keeping so well.  We are just tip top.  I go out on the Bike nearly every night for an Hour or so.  Kind Regards to all & Fond Love to George, Mum & yourself.
Your Fond SonHarry
