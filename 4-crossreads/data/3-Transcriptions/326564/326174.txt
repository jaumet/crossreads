<p>one of my Corporals, I reported him as on parade &amp; he wasn't, &amp; the best of the fun was that the Captain went round the huts &amp; hanged if he did not catch Lynch inside, of course he wanted to know what he was doing there for he was on no duty, what a gutser, but I got out of it easy enough for I had just taken the platoon over &amp; my roll was not complete.<br/>It has been very cloudy &amp; drizzling rain this afternoon but we had the afternoon off &amp; played bridge nearly all the time, it is a great game amongst us Sgts.</p>
<p>31st. Sunday &amp; nothing much doing except that the Colonel sent down for me wanted to know something about the discharge cups &amp; new bomb which had been taught us</p>
