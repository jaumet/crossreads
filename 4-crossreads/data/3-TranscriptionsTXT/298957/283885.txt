Ismailia. The Canal is 88 miles long and 140 yards wide built by an engineer named Ferdinand De Lesseps (a Frenchman). At Serapeum when we first arrived there the only means of crossing the Canal was by a punt worked on chains. A few hundred yards lower down than where we were there was a large camp of Royal Artillery men with their guns while nearby sections of Indian units - Hyderahbad Lancers and Queens Own Sappers and Miners were quartered. Just before we arrived I believe the Marajah of Mysore  & the Marajah of Hyderahbad were at Serapeum.
