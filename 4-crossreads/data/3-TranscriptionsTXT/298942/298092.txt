 Capt Young &amp; Sergeant [indecipherable] come round every night to see that all is well.  Tonight they told us that we might be leaving for another post in the morning.

 At about 3 p.m. Rogers &amp; B. came along with an order for me from Capt Young to return with all equipment to the central relay post.  (n       ear wagon loading post)
