<p>of Fighting Fritz in the Air. After thanking our Guide we made our way back to the Vans &amp; turned in, but could not sleep as Fritz was sending his shells over after the Dump now &amp; again just enough to annoy us, several shells burst very close to our Vans I was on the point of getting up &amp; shifting my Camp but as it was raining very hard I stopped where I was although when a shell burst very close, the Van shook with the concussion, I expected every minute to be my last. I dozed off to sleep after he stopped but was woke up again at 4 am Fritz with his Machine was close, in fact I jumped up &amp; looked out &amp; saw him just above a Hop Field near by, he was very low down. The Guns &amp; Machines were at him &amp; he was fireing his Machine Gun in return, the lights of the bursting shells made it a grand sight, anyhow after dropping two Bombs close by he cleared out &amp; all again was silent. Thursday 28/6/17. Fritz started sending his shells over after Breakfast so I adjourned to the Dug</p>
