<p>that it was a general impulse act prompted by irritation at what the Camp conceived to be injustice in the closing of the recreation ground. I also accept your further assurance, that their will be no further action of this sort, but that all orders of the Camp administration will be carried out as they have been in the past. I have accordingly, as I promises<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> ed requested the departement to excercise clemency and to withdraw the <strike>presecutli</strike> prosecution of the 141 Men of course may what the departement will do, but I hope it will see its way clear to do as I aske and that in the end the trouble of last week will ultimately result in the Camp matters working with less friction, than has been shown of late. I found all except 3 of the Men who wher <strike>interned</strike> placed in No 2 Compound (Singh Singh) have been replaced in the General Compound with except to the remaining 7, I cannot see my way clear to make any recomendation. As to the enquiry into the recent events I have only to state, that I have allready sayd, that I do not see what purpoases would be served as their does not seem to be any serious dispute as to the facts. Your memoranda, has been forwardet to Melbourne. You haive permission to write and aske for an Enquiry. I have as requested made a request to the departement with respekt to the release  &amp;  repatriation. If this request to the Departement can be accedet to, it will in my opinion do a lot to allay the present unrest. In conclussion may I beg of you personaly to use your bst endeavors  &amp;  prevent friction between the various elements in the Camp. From correspondence recieved their is by no means, unanimity in your counsels. I feel shure</p>
