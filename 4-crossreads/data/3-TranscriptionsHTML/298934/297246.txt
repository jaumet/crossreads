<p>part in a great feat of arms &amp; done all we had to do, no matter what cost.</p>
<p>2nd May Sunday 1915</p>
<p>Relieved the Marines in the firing line.  Last night/This morn the Turks at 1.30 a.m. blew bugles &amp; advanced with cries of 'Allah'.  As a result there are a lot more of dead 'uns in front of the trench.  We have very good trenches now.  A few snipers about troubling us.  Kitchener gave us 3 days with 30&percnt; losses to effect a landing.  We did it in as many hrs.</p>
<p>3rd May Monday 1915</p>
<p>Had a fairly quiet night in our part of the line.  Killed a few more.  We take turns to watch half hr. on &amp; half off every other man.  A party</p>
