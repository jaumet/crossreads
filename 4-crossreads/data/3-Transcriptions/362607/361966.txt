<p>2.6.17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>This is a picture of the famous Stonehenge. I've only been there once. It is a long walk. It is much nearer to Billy Alis Camp, which lies in the Shallow just below it. There are several places of interest that I have not visited yet but now the summer is here I hope to see them all. We are having very cool just now although June is in. The weather is very changeable here always one day fine, one day show &amp; another rain. We do not have snow now of course but we have lots of thunder storms &amp; wild winds. Well, Dad no news much. I am just writing to let you know we are all well. Cousin Marie has received your letter. Poor Aunt Hanna's Husband has spinal Trouble &amp; will have to lie in bed for two or three years. My Word Auntie has had to put her hand in her Pocket quite a lot.  Love etc George [indecipherable] Yourself   &amp;   Harry</p>
