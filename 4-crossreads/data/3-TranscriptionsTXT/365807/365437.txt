 My dear Judge 
 Yesterday was my birthday. After a long hot ride by myself I joined up the Battalion delighted to be back with them.  On my arrival I got 2 cables, one from you approving my promotion &amp; one from home with birthday greetings. I was also informed that I had been mentioned in despatches. I don't know what it was for quite but it is very nice to know that someone thinks your job is being decently done. 
 The Bri is out of the line training again. Everyone is working hard. the weather is awfully hot. the night &ndash; the dark part of it &ndash; lasts from about 9.30 pm till 3.30 AM. It is a marvellous climate. The grass everywhere is up to your knees. 
 I am at present 2nd in Command &amp; find plenty to do. The Colonel is commdg Brigade temporarily. 
 What a poor letter, am very fit 
 Cheerio. Best Love 
 Yours affectionately C.R. Lucas
