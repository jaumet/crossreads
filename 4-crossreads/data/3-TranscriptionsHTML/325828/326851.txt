<p>[Presbyterian Church letterhead]<br/>I returned to Camp that night.<br/>Walter will have probably told you that the ring you gave me fits me splendidly.  I think they have made a very good job of it, &amp; I am very proud of it.<br/>All being well, I expect to leave for Parkes to-morrow (Tuesday) night.  The Show is on Wednesday, Thursday &amp; Friday, &amp; I expect to <strike>leave</strike> return Friday night.  The train gets in early on Saturday morning so as I will not be required for duty till Saturday night at 10 PM. I would like to run out home for the Saturday.  In case I should be wanted whilst away, my postal address will be c/o Post Office, Parkes.  All the people of course roll up for Show Day so I hope to see most of my old Tichborne friends once more, perhaps for the last time.<br/>We have just on 62 patients in here now including 6 cases of mumps.<br/>Must close now, with love to you all,<br/>Your loving son<br/>Leo.</p>
