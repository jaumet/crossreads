<p>been doing. I have no chance to be shot here as we are a long way from fighting but we are in the first line of fire.<br/>Aunty I only hope that I can get near Rod for he would like me near him I sure and I got a letter from him the other day saying that he was in a rough place and had to gallop all the way that he went with rations and here is me here one camel escort to get rations of a morning and only can go as fast as a team of bullocks so I will have to close this time with a short letter so good bye.<br/>I remain<br/>Your loving nephew<br/>Oswald Castle</p>
