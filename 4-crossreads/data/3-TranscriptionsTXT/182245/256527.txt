 1917&nbsp; January 
 12 FRIDAY 
 Very Cold, with rain, snow &amp; sleet all 
 day, but cleared up in evening. 
 I went for a bath in the morning 
 with the bath parade. Out 
 exercising horses in the afternoon 
 I got a horse &amp; went into 
 Bailieul in evening with 
 Charlie Pearce to get some 
 things for the canteen, &amp; some 
 gum boots. Heard my R.F.C. 
 application was not 
 forwarded [past? post?] D.H. Headquarters 
 at Larkhill.
