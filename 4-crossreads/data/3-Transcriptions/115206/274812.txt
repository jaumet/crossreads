<p>August,1918<br/>Friday 30</p>
<p>Bourcy . Bty. Position.<br/>Weather cool and wet during early morning. We climbed out at 2.10am and pulled out at 2.20pm.<br/>After 2&frac12; hours on road, we came into position on the slope of a hill behind the above village. We are now back on the Somme battlefield of 1916 again and I can quite believe the stories of the mud that reigned supreme during that winter. <br/>Smithy and I wired the O.P. 3&frac12; miles kilos, and I reeled the best part up after shooting had finished. Saw our chaps though telescopes walking on the other bank of the canal .<br/>Wrote to Ken Gunn.</p>
