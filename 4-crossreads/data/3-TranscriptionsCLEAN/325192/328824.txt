With the end of this strike whe had peace in our Camp. Owing the Camp hawing granted permission, by the Comandant to run same on decant & proper lines, by ourself we formed a Committee wich duty it whas, to see justice & fair deal for both sides. This Committee consisted out of 1 Representative for each Company - or Barrack, whose duty it wher to see to everything needet in his company. These Representatives wher choosen by the Internees themselves under the Leadership of a President with the aid of a Secretary choosen by the Pris in General. Now we had our own Committee under the able & just Leadership of Mr Burkhardt wich retained this position untill Febr. 1916. so we lived under much improved condition
