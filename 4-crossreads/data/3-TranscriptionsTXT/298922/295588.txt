 Thursday 4th October 1917 
 Still hung up &ndash; we expected to get away today, now tomorrow - &amp; it is no use being impatient on active service. The ships come &amp;  down  go, through the Street as  it  appears of  TARANTO  - not unlike the scene in a comic Opera, where a big boat comes on the Stage. Beautiful sunsets &amp; still warm I am glad to say. Did not get off hope to do so tomorrow. 
 Convoys of French &amp; Italian troops go out each evening escorted by T.B.D.'s of different nations, the men are dressed in the Slate Blue uniforms of the Continent. 
  No war news. Posted notes from TARANTO.
