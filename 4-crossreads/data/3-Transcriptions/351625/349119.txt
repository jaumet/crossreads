<p>having a look at this we made on up the mountain, the monument being very high up we got a good deal higher into the bush and got a lot of silver leaves, some of which I am enclosing here as emblems of South Africa.  Coming down we set too and ran or tore down the steep hill for about half a mile having a race to see who would be last down and by jove it shook us up, when I reached the bottom my legs felt as though they were up in my body, next day we were so stiff that we could hardly walk.  On reaching Capetown we went and had a big feed and spent the rest of the evening walking about the street.  Every day we had leave I had a squad to take out with me but they have never yet all turned up at the place set down to meet as they get too drunk to get there and come in some time during the night, the last two times I was out I had a different lot of men, they were men belonging to my own table and were better at turning up than the other lot that I had.  The first time I had my own men 2 didn't turn up but came in dead drunk afterwards and about 3 of those that did turn up were drunk.  The next night I had about 6 drunk but having my own men I had trouble in managing them, in fact I had them telling me I was the best Corp. on the ship.  The sale of grog to Australians is prohibited but they get plenty all the same and often get bad stuff too which sends them right out or as mad as anything.  On Sunday we walked about 2 miles to church where I went to sleep as soon as I sat down I was so tired and stiff from late nights and the previous day's exertions &ndash; mountain climbing.  After dinner we went for a short route march, came on board and put out to sea for this place.  One day we went to the museum which is very interesting but not near as <strike>interesting as</strike> big as the Sydney museum.  Two more boat loads of Australians came to Capetown a few days ago and the chances are they will accompany us to England with the mail boat that is in there too.  I don't know whether I mentioned it in my previous letters but Corp Hosier wishes to be remembered to you all.  At Durban we tried to cable to you but all cabling is stopped for the troops.  The day we left Capetown a boat load of Portugese soldiers put in at the same wharf as us, they are a funny looking lot, dressed in blue grey uniforms with great big helmets of the same color.  When we were leaving their band came out and played Tipperary, God save the King and several other tunes.  They cheered us and we cheered them.  The gun we took on is a 6 incher I think so if we see any submarines we will give them a warm reception.  I had a nasty touch of influenza about the time we put into Capetown &ndash; the first day we had leave I was too crook to do anything but sit in a writing room and write but I am all right now except for a bit of a cough.  Back off going for a route march this afternoon with full equipment on, we don't expect to get any more leave here.  I am going to give this letter to someone in the street on the march so let me know if you get it all right.</p>
<p>Love and kisses to all<br/>Your loving son<br/>Douglas.</p>
<p>Ken sends his love to all, he says next time you write he will be a private again and I will be the same.  We have just got leave for tonight, which was not expected so we are all excited and intend to have a good time.<br/>Doug.</p>
