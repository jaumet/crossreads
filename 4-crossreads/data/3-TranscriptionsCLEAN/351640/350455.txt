Just think of it 1. per week.  As far as my judgment goes there was no greater deed of heroism in the anals of the world.  Nor were there ever braver men than the two privates, with the fate of the Medical officer ringing in their ears as it did from end to end of the land, who offered to make trial in their bodies of that power of the mosquito to do infect them with the fell disease.  They stipulated that there should be no monetary reward.  Is it wonder that Dr. Reed, who was speaking to them, on receiving their decision, jumped to his feet and said with his hand to his cap:  "Gentlemen I salute you!"  What is the name of the doctor?  Will it come to me during the day?  Is it not strange that no medical man to whom I have directed enquiry has been able to give me the name.  One had thought that on the tip of each professional tongue the name were ready to leap forth.  No!!!!.  Such is heroism?  Such is self sacrifice?
9 p.m. - The name of that doctor has not yet come to my lips.  Bother! Botheration!!!!
In your next letter send to me the names and addresses of the people whom you knew & who were kind to you when you were travelling.  Then if I am their way it will be a pleasure for me to salute them & thank them personally.
