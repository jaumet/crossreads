Taking 18 empty Camels down to Khan Yunis tomorrow morning at 7 a.m.  Tanks crew reckon that we attack tomorrow morning mais juoi je ne pense pas.
16th AprilDeir el BelahI think we attack tomorrow morning.  St. L & I have a job of taking out a convoy of 80 camels in case of emergency to anywhere that they may be required & as the officer in charge is Irish & town-bred & from all accounts is a bit of an idiot St. L. & I have been studying maps & compasses all the morning with a view of nursing him.  It is now dark & we have had no orders yet;  I hope we shall spend a peaceful night.  It wouldn't be much good us starting in the dark for none of us could find our way.  I suppose tomorrow morning they will lift the lid off hell.Today we put several H.Es. into Gaza.  Must have been an 8 or 9" gun I should think.If no orders come for us
