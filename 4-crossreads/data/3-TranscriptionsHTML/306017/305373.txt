<p>October 1916<br/>Answered.  A parcel sent by cousin Meg also arrived.  We have rumours that we are going East again.  It is probably correct, but I don't think any of us want to go that way again.</p>
<p>27th October to November 13th<br/>Still in the Hill 70 camp pursuing the same monotonous round of duties. The weather is getting cooler &amp; the days shortening.  Football is the popular sport each squadron has a team &amp; nearly all the spare time is put in playing. Alexandria leave has been cut out &amp; men are going for 7 days to Port Said.  However it is possible to get special passes to Cairo &amp; Alex from the Port Said rest camp which makes it fairly good.  The Regt has been doing its course of musketry again.  The range is a very poor one.  I got the 2nd highest score in the squadron  The shooting right through was very satisfactory  Received my first Xmas parcel on the 6th Nov.  Some West Indian troops came out to the Hill 70 camp.  They are big on boxing  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////, play the</p>
