<p>3-1-17<br/>Wed 3rd<br/>Heavy thunder &amp; lightning last night &amp; a good deal of rain, in fact it rained all night. B Sqdn (on Outpost) had a very rough time of it. The rain stopped at 8 oclock this morning but it is cloudy &amp; very cold, I went to Bde Head Qrs this morning &amp; Roger gave me a lively 10 minutes to start with warming us both up, I ran the coil of Turkish wire in today as the Sig Troop put up posts yesterday &amp; we now have an air line &amp; we cannot very well do without it here as the wire on the ground gets covered with sand &amp; the rains keeping the ground always wet runs the current to earth;</p>
