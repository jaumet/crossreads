<p>Mar: 10<br/>Manoeuvres.  For the first time after the many hard marches I have done, I fainted  - very amusing thing; I fell down just as is I had been shot; my companions, who were only a few yards ahead of me, within easy speaking distance, did not miss me until they had gone some considerable distance. I wonder how I'll get on when I am faced with the real hardships of War -  I casn only hope that I don't blow out before I have at least done a little.</p>
<p>Mar: 10<br/>Studies at the Caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>Mar; 11<br/>Flag drill &ndash; kit inspection &ndash; studies.</p>
<p>Mar; 12<br/>Manoeuvres &ndash; studies.</p>
<p>Mar; 13<br/>Visit Cairo with my friend Bell.</p>
<p>Mar; 14<br/>Studies.  Visit friends in Cairo; they say they are French but they cannot speak one word of the language and in every way are obviously Egyptians.</p>
<p>Mar; 15<br/>A great event!  I am given three days C.B. for refusing to attend that farcical absurdity Church Parade. Strike camp. Studies intermingle with my first experience of the "Angel's Whisper".</p>
<p>Mar: 16<br/>Bivouac &ndash; manoeuvres &ndash; and C.B.  All the camp are delighted to hear that Silas has C.B! &ndash; the lads are immensely amused and come along to see me do it; if it had been pack drill I think they would have paid a pound a head for front seats.</p>
