<p>a bad day for our squadron.  Of 30 men that went out, 8 came back safely, and they all had <strike>major</strike> miraculous escapes.  I was not sorry when we all got back.  A heavy bombardment of Achi Baba was going on and our work was to jump out and make the enemy think we were going to attack, so they would not send any men away to re-inforce Achi Baba.  Our demonstration is said to have had the desired effect.</p>
<p>13th<br/>Up at 3 a.m. on water fatigue.  Destroyers shelled old Gaba Tepe forts heavily.  Some of our re-inforcements arrived.</p>
<p>14th<br/>In new firing line.</p>
