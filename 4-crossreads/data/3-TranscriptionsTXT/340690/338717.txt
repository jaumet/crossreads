 down unsuccessfully to Y.M.C.A. for notepaper.  Wrote letters on return.  Walkers farewell order.  Out at 9 as usual with Bailey who took 3 men for loading pontoon at Botha Farm.  Worked this side of Post deepening and widening.  Some shells about 11 and chased us from job and two 5.9" very close.  Started work again and did about half an hour's work and shelling started again.  Dropped tools and mob cleared off home.  Not very dangerous shelling and home quietly with Finter &amp; Sergeant &amp; Bailey rest going their own way.  Caught pontoon on road and rode all way home, arrived about 12.30 with Groth &amp; to bed. 
 4.7.18 Fine but cloudy.  Up at 12 and read in afternoon and wrote some letters.  About 8.50 Fritz heavy barrage came down just behind Pradelles and a lot of gas shell.  Could only get just outside Borre and Groth &amp; Burnop returned from Pradelles with nose &amp; eyes running.  Waited for about half an hour &amp; rest went home &amp; Groth &amp; I went up to turn parties back if they came up.  Lot of gas going up and and shells in Pradelles.  Waited about half an hour &amp; came back meeting Robb &amp; 1st Coy men and Walsh, Reid, Burnop &amp; Sparkes near 4-5 forward batteries and had to go back with them. Took Reid &amp; to take shovels etc. back to Linton's job.  However tools all claimed as trench stores so straightened up and after talk with 10th Batt. came back and home about 12.30 &amp; to bed.
