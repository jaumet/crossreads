 Saturday September 1st Done guard from 8 till 9 am, so we only done five hrs guard  at  in twenty four. Dismounted guard at 9 am. Very windy &amp; wet again. Went down to Portland this afternoon. It was very quiet down there though. Nearly killed me walking up the hill home. 
 Sunday Sept 2nd Went to church in the Gym, was lucky enough to get an arm chair (supplied by the Australian Red Cross) &amp; slept nearly all through the service, a thing I have never been guilty in my  life  advanced life before. Went to Portland &amp; back via Easton this afternoon, both places are very quiet. A very fine day. 
 Monday Sept 3rd A lovely day. They are the biggest messers about I have ever seen, in this camp. Two muster parades were held today what for goodness only know. It is a dreadfully camp. Colonel Spencer-Brown (the C.O.) inspected the camp this afternoon. There are about 2500 here, but a lot of those are B1B &amp; B1a class. Boat rolls are the topical conversation in camp.
