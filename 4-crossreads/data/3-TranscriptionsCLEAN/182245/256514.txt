 Saturday 30 th  Dec. 
 Fine & cold. We arrived at Havre 
 in morning & anchored in the stream 
 till near midday, when we 
 went up the docks. Got all our 
 Cases ect off and after waiting 
 a hell of a time got off about 9 pm 
 & marched to a rest camp about 
 six miles out, where we picketed 
 the horses & got to sleep in tents 
 about 12.30 AM.
