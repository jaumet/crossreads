 Sept 1916 13th/20 &ndash; On 15th given another stripe, temporarily. Brass will come in handy. Probably last &amp; be confirmed later. Time to talk then!!!

On 29th at 7am Bde moved off &amp; we arrived at Romani about 4.30pm. We came via Qatia, bde followed railway. Collected what would probably be our last feeds of dates from Qatia. Fine dates. Oghratina fairly well stripped of them. Palm leaves also stripped from other hods. Road-making purposes. 20/30th &ndash; Took up 1st L.H.F.A. camp. Very dirty.

Mobile Section going  overland  on camel &amp; remainder by rail. Did not leave till 8.30 &amp; it was 5.15 on arriving at Hill 70. Gen'l Chauvel gave lecture on 1st &amp; gave D.C.M. to Lt Finley on 7th L.H. earned on peninsula. Chauvel seems to be getting very unpopular &amp; becoming Tommy-ised which troops do not like. Everyone against Hill 70. 1st went to swing bridge Kantara &amp; getting leave to  City Beach  Sidi Bishr Alex'da. Long while in getting fixed up. Given Operating tent &amp; eventually an E.P. S.S.
