<p>Our late transport officer, Connor, now O.C. (temp) of B. Coy. was in command of the last 40 men with 5 guns &amp; teams &amp; finally of the last 10 men after the guns were withdrawn. His men were all from my old coy., B &amp; Lt. Blanchard was his sub. Blanchard left Sydney as a Sergt. was promoted soon after arriving at Anzac to 2nd Lt., &amp; shortly afterwards to Lieut. for conspicuous gallantry. Capt. Ross had the last 34 to leave the firing line, Connor's position being on inner line of defence. Ross drew his men from A. Coy., where your son is now 2nd in command. After Connor left I had Capt. Hutchinson (Med. Offcr.) Lt. Broadbent, Orderly Officer, &amp; Lt. Caddy (Engineers) with me. I sent away Hutchinson &amp; the signallers, blew the mines, sent off Broadbent &amp; Caddy, saw all was clear &amp; I pushed off myself. The 20th have won undying glory for their excellent work &amp; have been congratulated on all sides, Genls. Birdwood &amp; Godley being particularly enlagestive.</p>
