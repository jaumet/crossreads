am told our westerly cruise took us near S Am. & consequently we reach Blighty about 27 or 28 not earlier.                                                                                           21/ ENE. Heavy Sea  63rd Day of trip. Lost my Belt to-day & saw another. Chap asked me did it belong to me. Had CGP all over & in one place CG Pryce. Charlie's life Belt on the way over! (what ship did he come over in?)                                        If folks saw the way their gifts are handled they'd take less notice of the Hot air in the newspapers about the Good Work. Several cases of Red X goods split up on deck to-day. NCOs on boat are getting mysterious bundles of knitted sox.
