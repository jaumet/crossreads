Freeme (who had previously won the D.C.M) in fact who was the first man to get the D.C.M. on the Peninsular) left via our trenches &amp;amp; went out under cover of infantry fire to carry out the work allotted to them.<br/>Unfortunately a trench which was supposed to be unoccupied by the enemy had during the night filled up with Reserves of enemy Infantry.<br/>Lieut Street &amp;amp; Segt Freeme were a considerable distance in advance of their &amp;amp; were surprised to find the trench occupied. Lieut Street immediately grasped the situation &amp;amp; saw that if prompt measures were not taken the whole of the party would be wiped out.<br/>He at once gave the order to retire &amp;amp; he &amp;amp; Freeme opened fire on the enemy with their revolvers &amp;amp; threw what bombs they had at the enemy &amp;amp; during the confusion which prevailed the whole party made it safely back to their own trenches.<br/>At Three oclock the following morning Capt Lloyd in charge of 50 men charged the same position with disaterous effects to themselves 5 men being left dead on the field &amp;amp; almost every other man being wounded.<br/>Capt Lloyd was Decorated with the Military Cross for his Bravery but in my opinion Lieut Street was just as much entitled to honors as I consider his deed was the bravest that I saw.<br/>No. 762.
