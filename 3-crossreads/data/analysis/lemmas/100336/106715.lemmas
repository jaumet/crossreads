 a veri poor finish to our Xmas holiday . This episod strengthen our resolv to escap . Our temper was often at the break point , through the constant jibe and refin cruelti they subject us to . They tri in everi way possibl to break our spirit . It was onli the hope of escap that kept us up at all dure that wretch persecut which last near five month from Oct 17 to April 18 whilst we were collect materi for our collaps boat . No doubt the German task-mast thought their slave drive each day would leav us littl strength or inclin when we were lock up for the night to do anyth els but sleep. But we work on past midnight veri often and befor sleep we hid the stuff in a cave we dug to avoid detect . Our feel can be better imagin than describ when everyth was readi . The suspens of the boat be discov and the knowledg of which await us if we fail was nerv wrack . But at last the long pray for chanc came on 29th April , and we resolv to put the result of our five month secret , midnight toil to the test . The failur of my first attempt and the consequ punish onli made me more desper and I secret determin that if I were caught again and brought back , death in ani shape was better than a continu of the slaveri and degrad of the last six month . There seem to be no end to the war . In fact it seem to be get further away . It was as well to attempt an escap as die of fever if we remain in the Camp . Note: - on Gelebek .: - Of all the differ camp I have been in Gelebek was by far the worst both for work food and fever . All these camp becam wors as time went on , becaus of the shortag of food and the great increas of price of local grown stuff own to the Turkish note , depreci in valu . Ear in 1918 it was possibl to sell a Turkish sovereign for 6:10:0 in note . Of cours we were alway paid in note and money come from England was alway paid to us in note . At the end of 1916 silver went complet out of circul . The Turkish govern print note as low as 2d which I suppos is a record . The Turkish livr i.c. is worth 16/8 in normal time .
