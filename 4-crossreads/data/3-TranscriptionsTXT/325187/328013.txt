 Bronchitis better Met another cousin Walter Weir, son of Uncle Joe Weir's- not a bad sort. Mr Ferrar takes me back per Motor today via Donoughmore or Tullamurry.  I passed thro Newry &amp; many old sayings of the Pater came to mind  Had afternoon tea at Class Drummond no servants &amp; great poverty, didn't see Joe although he knew I was coming   Frank &amp; Lue both married. Kathleen 17 years old &amp; had little education. the old place overgrown with weeds- Joe I believe had been drinking so did not stop long but very kind of course.
