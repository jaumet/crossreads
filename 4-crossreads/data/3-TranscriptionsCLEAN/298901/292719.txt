a new idea & a good one as his duty is to see if there are any drugs lying idle & if so to take them back.Had a visit from a man named Ede who enlisted with me in 1914.
Dimanche 19 MaiCollected drugs from Crouy,[?] a very warm & dusty trip yet withal pleasant.Had a little excitement last night about midnight.  Fritz had been putting a few shells over very close to us during the evening & About 12, landed one about 50 yds away right alongside the officers mess, killing a tommy who was seeking shelter behind a wall.  It was an extraordinary burst, throwing the man away 20 yds away & a huge stone weighing 98 lbs right over a large 3 storey building to crash through a roof & fall between 2 men who were sleeping on the floor, one of the men receiving only a superficial graze, an extraordinary escape.A gas alarm was also given but that was unnecessary & I only lost about 1/2 hours
