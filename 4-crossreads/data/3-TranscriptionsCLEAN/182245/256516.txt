 JANUARY 1917 
 1 MONDAY 
 Fine. Travelling in the train 
 till 2pm. We got out at a place 
 called Bailleul (about 10 miles 
 from Armentiers) and went 
 out to a farm about 7 miles 
 out & picketed the horses & the 
 men slept in the barns. I was 
 on horse picket all night. 
 Well I dont want to spend next 
 New Years day like this. . 
 We can hear the guns going 
 all day & night. 
   
 Aye free, aff han', your story tell 
 When wi' a bosom crony; 
 But still keep something to yoursel 
 Ye scarcely tell to ony. 
 Conceal yoursel as week's Ye can 
 Frae critical dissection; 
 But keek thro' ev'ry othe right man 
 Wi' sharpened sly inspection.
