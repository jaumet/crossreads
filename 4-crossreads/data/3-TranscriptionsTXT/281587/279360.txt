 The Archies did splendid work, and put up an excellent barrage, which turned Johnny.  He was not game to face it, and it saved the situation for us, as he was steering straight for us.

Jacko sent a few chance shells over just before nightfall.  If he had swung his gun a fraction to his left, he would have made it very uncomfortable for us.  As it was they harmed nobody.  It was very curious to watch them.  One would
