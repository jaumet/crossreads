1/7/19 London
much farming and agricultural land. Very flat. Reached Hull about 11 and used motor transport to get down to the boat transporting our drunks in a box car. The "Chemnitz" is a vessel of 8000 tons and had been used by the Huns for transport work in the Baltic. The reek of new paint is over all. The men were soon stowed away on a troop deck (our advance parties were more than 100 in total and issued with a blanket apiece and some tea and food. Afterwards the officers had some too and then all turned in between white clean sheets which are luxurious after hairy and blankets. Crowds of painters carpenters and others busy on the fitting out of the ship.
