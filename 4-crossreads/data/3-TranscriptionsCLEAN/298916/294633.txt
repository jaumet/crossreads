Teddy was very concerned over the possibilities of this set, as he put it, Heaven help the transport 15 miles away. Naturally, as is usual in most cases undertaken by "military muddlers" the efficiency of this low powered set was almost nil.

The resulting note was ragged & broken, often fizzling out in the middle of a word, picking itself up later on. The operator generally tried to overdo the speed rate & made an awful bungle of it.
