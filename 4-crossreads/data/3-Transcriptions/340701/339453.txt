<p>sweeping the streets with machine guns.</p>
<p>Wednesday 14-2<br/>Day off, Visited Corbie 16 Kilos away.  Had a good day.  Ate a lot of Eggs &amp; returned to Albert in the afternoon.  We visited the picture show there &amp; heard some good vaudeville stuff.  Signs of a thaw about now.</p>
<p>Friday 16-2-17<br/>German Planes came over last night flying very low.  The anti aircraft guns were firing at them &amp; the shells burst so low that the fragments were fairly raining on the roof of the Mill.  Fritz kept his machine guns going &amp; He managed to blow up a big ammunition Dump a few miles away.  In the cold weather they had a great deal of trouble with the logs owing to the sap being frozen &amp; blunting the saw.  There is a Bomb School close to our camp.</p>
