 At Sea 21 Oct 1916 
 My Dearest Mother 
 I'm just scribbling this to catch the pilot boat before she returns to port. By the time you get it we will be well out on old ocean &amp; I am led to believe that it will be some time before we touch a port from which we can write. All day yesterday we spent in embarkation &ndash; there was a dickens of a crowd, including many Sydney lads &amp; the ships looked fine.  Our boat is first rate though small. Fitted up A1 &amp; tucker of the best. Heaven only knows how we will employ ourselves &ndash; I expect that we'll be bribing the stokers to give us something to do before we reach the cold country. Am very fit &amp; well, like the rest, &amp; enjoy the change in tucker especially. We expected to be hung up in port for a few days, but it did not come off thank goodness. Must close now with love to all &amp; heaps for yourself &ndash; don't worry, we're going to have a fine time on this old tub or I'm much mistaken.
