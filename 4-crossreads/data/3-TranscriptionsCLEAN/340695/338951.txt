Village Chateau a fine big mansion. We have one of the back rooms which opens on to an old built up verandah covered in creepers. The grounds have been beautiful at one time but troops have cut it up a good deal. It would be an ideal spot to write a novel from I think Mrs Henry Wood and other "deep" authors must have resided in such a place.Had quite a Xmas last night received two parcels a couple of days ago & sank into them last night. Geo Veitch & a couple more lads of the coy. came along and all enjoyed the good things. Made a large hole in Dorie's cake, it was great. The parcels were from home & Dorie.
