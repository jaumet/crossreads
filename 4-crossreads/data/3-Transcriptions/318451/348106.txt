<p>life before.  That is hard for a Britisher to realise.  This is a narrow gauge line which winds among the hills &amp; through very pretty country.  After 2&frac12;  hrs. (15 miles), we reached Boulonge.  Boulonge is a fine place, beautiful beach &amp; fine shops &amp; in every way a prosperous busy town.  I put the day in here &amp; returned at 5 oclock.  I missed the road at about dusk &amp; after some difficulty, I managed to find my way home.</p>
<p>Saturday<br/>Returned with cart to Serques station for my purchases &amp; quickly disposed of them (cigs., Tobacco, etc.) on my return.<br/>Went to 36 Bat. H.Q. &amp; made arrangements for Sunday.  (1300 prisoners captured Arras.)</p>
<p>Sunday Apl. 15th<br/>Today has been wet &amp; miserable.  My parades have been much interfered with but I had 2, one with A Cy. 36 &amp; D Cy. 35, both in big barns, &amp; both well attended.  Wrote Home tonight.</p>
