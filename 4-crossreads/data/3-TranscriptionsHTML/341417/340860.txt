<p>bullets flew a little high over us but many went amongst us. I went back and brought Crowley in; someone else got Johnson and some others who had fallen when we ran into the fire &ndash; the bullets were still as bad as ever, and it was very unhealthy anywhere there.<br/>Stayed in gully for a while and helped a first aid Ambulance chap bind up Crowley's wound and a lot of other wounded &ndash; the top of the gully &ndash; or rather the narrow bed of it, was full of dead and wounded and I had to pick my steps moving about for fear of treading on them.
