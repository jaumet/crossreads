<p>Captain Anderson,<br />Master,<br />S.S. &quot;Messina&quot;,<br />Rabaul.</p>
<p>Sir,<br />It was my intention on arrival at Rabaul with the German Prisoners from Nauru, to have transferred the latter to the S.S. &quot;Matunga&quot; for transport to Sydney, so that your Ship might return direct to Nauru to load phosphate for the Pacific Phosphate Company, but unfortunately the &quot;Matunga&quot; sailed from here on the 11th instant.</p>
<p>As there will be no opportunity of sending the Prisoners now on board your Ship to Australia&nbsp; for at least 3 weeks, and I consider it highly undesirable that they should be taken on shore here, I have to request you to put to sea at 4-0 p.m. to-day, and proceed direct to Sydney and convey the Prisoners to that Port under a Military Guard that will be placed on board.</p>
<p>I have the honor to be,<br />Sir,<br />Your obedient servant,</p>
<p>Colonel.<br />Administrator.</p>
