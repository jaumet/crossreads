<p>Hospital straight away. I had only influenza, but on account of the very hot days &amp; cold nights, they have to be very careful of colds &amp; that sort of thing, as they very quickly turn into pneumonia. But you need not be alarmed in the slightest, I'll be OK again soon now. Have been here some 9 or 10 days &amp; am getting on fine. But there is something much worse than influenza troubling me. My company had only been at Abbasseih about 1 week when they were ordered to join the 13th Batt, whom of course they are Reinforcing, at Heliopolis, that is right next to me here, &amp; some of my pals often come in to see me. They had not been here 6 days when the 13th Batt together with nearly all the Infantry here received notice for ??? &ndash; we don't know where but are almost sure it is the Dardenelles. Our O.C. told our boys that they are almost sure to be under fire inside 5 or 6 days. There are some 40,000 French troops at Alexandria, &amp; they are also going over with the Aust &amp; NZ. Men. We hear that an army of 100,000 Turks are waiting for us, so there should be "somethin' doin'". Our army is expected to be landed, under fire from our warships on the Dardenelles &amp; most probably will engage the Turks at once, &amp; if all goes well, we'll start marching on</p>
