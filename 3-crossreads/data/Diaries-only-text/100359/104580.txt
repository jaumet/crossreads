Wednesday 19th
Another quiet day. Only a few cases coming in. One poor Chap died as soon as he arrived. Went to Bath House where I had a hot bath and change of clothing. This is a great place. We hand in our dirty clothes and get a complete clean outfit, socks, shorts, underpants etc. after bathing we hand in our dirty towel and get a clean one in exchange. Besides we can get our clothes fumigated while we wait. B.Sec. of the 14th F. Amb are running it. They have a party of French girls to sew buttons and do repairs. The germans dropped a few shells on a "factory" in the town this afternoon and made rather a mess of it. Wrote to Cis.
Thursday 20th
Last night about 5, one's ears were deafened by the terrific din of the bombardment. Things were quiet at our Clearing Station, the patients dribbling through in one's and twos, abut 10.30 5 Germans wounded arrived under an armed Guard of N.Z, of course everyone rushed to have a look at ?em and also see what could be obtained in the way of souvenirs. Their buttons disappeared very soon, All our M.O's were out in the trenches at the various dressing stations leaving only the Col. and "Maudie". Only 1 of the 5 was badly injured. He had a nasty wound in his back the rest of ?em were only slightly wounded. A number of us climbed up a tree at the back of the Brewery, where we got a good view of the bombardment. Our chaps were to change about 6, and we heard that they had captured the first 3 lines of trenches with very little loss. Of course everyone was delighted I "Turned in" at about midnight but everyone was too excited to sleep. About 2 o'clock every available man was called for to go it as Bearers, All B. Section, with the exception of about 10 of us, were already out. And all of C. Section, A. Section, transport and all turned out like one man, it was everyone one was dead anxious to be first, the rest of us had to stay behind to unload the ambulances.
