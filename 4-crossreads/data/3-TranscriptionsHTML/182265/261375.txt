<p>Entry <u>5/10/17</u> - Midday. Raining heavily on and off since last night. A light railway train is puffing past my little tent. Wonderful what loads these 2ft. lines carry. This engine is now pushing over 120 tons of munitions &amp; there are hundreds of these engines as well as bigger ones always going on dozens of lines. There are immense military stores everywhere one goes. It is no wonder a dump or two are now &amp; again blown up by enemy shells. Yesterday morning four of our Australian divisions made another very successful push. They caught the Germans just ready to attack us. They were lined up on their tape - 1500 of them - at daybreak when our terrible barrage came down. Not one escaped - 900 were killed &amp; 600 captured - so I have had it reported to me by an officer of 23rd Bn who was there.</p>
<p>Heavy guns are constantly firing somewhere or other the nearer reports sharp &amp; incisive, those far away like the trembling</p>
