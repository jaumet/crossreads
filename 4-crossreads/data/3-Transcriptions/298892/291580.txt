Everything had to be packed up and prepared for transport just as if we were going straight to the front. We set off at 9 a.m., with full transport column &amp;c., and with our midday ration of bread and cheese in our pockets. We had our dinner on the road-side and arrived at our destination, Lower Wallop, at about 5 p.m. We were billetted here for the night. The A.M.C. quarters were in a fine old house undergoing repairs and we managed to make ourselves very comfortable. Of course the house was vacant and our own cooks provided our tucker.
