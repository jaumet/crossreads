The "Franconian" sailed past this morning loaded with Scottish Troops.

The climax came this evening. One of our Sgt’s came into the Mess Tent and calling out a few names of which I happened to be one of them. We were told to be on the parade ground in ten minutes time. We could not understand what new move was on. We appeared on parade as ordered.

A number of other names were then called out and they were told that they were under arrest. We were told to put on our belts and were put on guard over the men under arrest.

This trial business seems to be becoming more funny every day.

Men from other units are beginning to learn about it and there is quite a big commotion being caused.

March 2nd. Thurs.
Quite a big rush of sick patients came into hospital to-day. They seem to be more serious than usual.

The chaps who were put under arrest yesterday were tried to-day. Nearly every one of them got 21 days second field punishment.

A severe sand storm to-day.

March 3rd. Fri.
Owing to about fifteen men being in jail the working of hospital is much heavier on the remaining staff.

The sand storm still continues.

March 4th Sat. 5th Sun.
One of Cook’s Tourist boats is now being used to transfer the patients
