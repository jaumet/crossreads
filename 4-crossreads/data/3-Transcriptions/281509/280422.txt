<p>1916 July 18<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>An exceptionally furious bombardment began at 7 p.m &amp; continued without interruption till daylight. Something must be doing  This part is considered one of the hottest of the line.<br/>Stayed about our billets all day expecting orders to move on. Did not come. Went to see some trenches further in wood. Wonderfully constructed, deep &amp; long. Artillery arrive in wood several batteries. Mud &amp; slush. Short rations  Go down to village and augment our tea with fried eggs &amp; bread.</p>
