 Coming back this evening I looked in at the H.Q. of the 45th Battalion &amp; am sorry to say got bad news of your cousin. As a result of the stunt on the 7th he is listed as "wounded, believed killed"  He received several wounds &amp; fell &amp; someone gave him water &amp; rations but had to go on. Eventually we failed to hold that part
