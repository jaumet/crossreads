Caught 10 a.m. train from Ludgershall arrived Waterloo, London about 12 noon. Went Kings Cross by Tube booked bed at Y.M.C.A. Then wired to Uncle Charlie Uncle Will about the leave. Walked right down Grays Inn Road to Holborn then took Tube to the Bank then went to Basinghall St. to Petersen Boesens but there were no parcels for me. Then went along Cheapside to St. Pauls which I looked at inside for few minutes. Then went along Cannon St. looked in at Cannon St. Rail Stn., then further along Cannon St. Tower St. to the Tower of London which I thoroughly went over. Saw in it the Armouries, Crown Jewels, Sir Walter Raleigh's Cell, Bloody Tower where Princes were murdered, Beauchamp Tower all historical places. Then went along Tower Hill on to the Tower Bridge. Came back then into Tower St. to Mark Lane Underground Rail Stn. went to Charing Cross Stn. Looked over the big Rail Stn. there then went to Trafalgar Square, Leicester Sq., Piccadilly Circus along Regent St. to Oxford Circus. There took bus along Gt. Portland St. Euston Rd.
