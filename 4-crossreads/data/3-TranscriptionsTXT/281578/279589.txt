[indecipherable] in this continual rain. Had a read in my little shelter, & blew the candle out at 11.30 p.m. Sunday 28 July Had to go down to Bn. Headqrs. again this morning; Lt Col Marks wanted to see the report I wrote of the canteen committee meeting. Blast their canteen committee, I wish someone else was the representative, these extra jobs are no bon. It is 5 kilos down there, but I got a ride back on a motor lorry. I heard bombs being dropped last night by a Fritz plane, & I saw today where one dropped beside the road where the motor lorries are parked. The drivers sleep in their lorries, but a corporal was in a dugout by the road, & the bomb must have blown him to pieces. I saw his greatcoat, which was riddled with holes & had been blown up into a big tree on the other side of the road. One never knows when his time is coming at this game. After tea I had a look at some tanks which are lying in the wood near us, they are awful weapons to the enemy against them, there's no doubt. Monday 29 July Had rifle exercises, pile arms & c all the morning. It makes us very wild, this recruits' drill when out of the line; it will take a good bit of sloping arms by numbers to drive back the Hun anyhow. After tea D Coy played a Tommy Siege Battery cricket, but the ground wicket made cricket not of the best
