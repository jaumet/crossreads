<p>My Dear Cousin Willie<br/>Your very welcome letter of 18.6.18 reached me a few days ago and I hasten to send my very sincere thanks for the same.  You were quite right in your letter in saying that I had not heard of poor old Terry's death by the 22nd April, in fact I think it was about the very end of that month that Aunt Bee wrote &amp; told me the sad news.<br/>Since last writing to you I have been trying hard to find out any particulars of his death, but I have not been able to find any of his fellow officers from whom I had hoped</p>
