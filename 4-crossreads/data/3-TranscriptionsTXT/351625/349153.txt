Abide with Me.
Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;The darkness deepens; Lord with me abide;When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,Help of the helpless, O abide with me.
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;Change and decay in all around I see:O Thou, Who changest not, abide with me.
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless;Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness;Where is death's sting?  Where, Grave, thy victory?I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.
Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes;Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.
Amen.
