at the time the preparatory bombardment was at its height & then moved on to the A.D.S at Becourt.  [in margin Becourt near La Boiselle.  Here we turned in until morning & slept through the most terrific gunnery until 5 am when we moved to the Aid Post.  Such a scene of desolation I have never imagined, the land being simply pock marked with great shell holes of the English bombardments.  The villages of Contalmaison & Pozieres were simply levelled & the High Wood bared of all but a few stumps.
Along the road were many mangled corpses & the wounded have been coming in very quickly.  Last night the 1st & 3rd Brigades charged & established themselves on the outskirts of the village of Pozieres, Contalmaison being already in our hands, but with heavy casualties.  Our work was hard & we suffered about 20 casualties including three killed.  Dock & Bantry both being wounded (Rest to memory.  We have now come out with the Division & are now [stretcher] bearing at the hospital for the 2nd Division who charged but owing to missing barbed wire, failed in their objective.  Heavy casualties.
Aug 1st  We are now resting at Warloy.
Aug 2nd  A party of 20 including myself have been sent on to Puchevillers where we are doing the local bearing for 44th C.C.S. [Casualty Clearing Station]  Things are not too bright & the food is far from the best, the head receiving the name of the 4th Batt Green & white.  The sisters vary as to personal charms etc.A congratulatory order was read out to us re the "great gallantry'(?) displayed by the 1st Field & we have been congratulated by Birdie.
Aug 4th  General Birdwood to-day spoke to a party of us individually, & told us that to-night the second attempt by the 2nd Divn is to be made to gain German trenches.  He is indeed a fine chap & speaks to men as affably as if we were on the same plane as himself.
August 9th  Leave Puchevillers to-day after a week's work & a good time?  Although none of us were crimed it was not the fault of one of us, what with arguments with the NCO's & nurses.  Arrive at Halloy-Genoes.
