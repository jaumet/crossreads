?Ome Papers.
We'll be glad if you'll allow us just to write and tell ? explain
With a foot of nice thick mud below and overhead the rain
Weve been looking at ?ome papers and if all we see is true
In them fine an? fancy photos ? just a word or two with you 
Chuck up yer bloomin pageants an yer fancy dress affairs
Yer can ?elp the poor at ?ome ? and us ? and never leave yer chairs
Knights in armour gaily prancin? may look fine in Martin place
But the nights in mucky trenches is the thing that wins the race
This route-marchin? too of ?Wombats? is spectacular fine
But a train is heaps the quickest way to join the thin brown line
Tho? these schools fer training officers may bring yer ?bucksheesh? stars
You?d be better as a ranker diggin? round fer silver bars
