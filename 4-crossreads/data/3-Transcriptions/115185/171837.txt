<p>8 &ndash; 20.7.1915<br/>All decks are used all day till about 5 pm to excise and parade the troops.<br/>Everything is very interesting that goes on &ndash; so different from any other ship I've been on &ndash; even different from a hospital ship. I did some sewing &amp; reading &amp; washing today and was inoculated for Cholera &ndash; in the chest wall. The spot is very painful now and one has been promised fever and discomfort for 36 hours. I wonder the various germs or antigerms or dead boddies or whatever they are that I've had injected into my body</p>
