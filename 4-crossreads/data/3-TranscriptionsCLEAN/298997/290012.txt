"Stand down" being given; but after a sleep, I felt all right again in the afternoon; so much so that I volunteered to take the place of a man on a fatigue to bring up rations from Clarks' Dump, where the light railway finishes; thinking that he naturally would relieve me of a later fatigue.  But he proved no sport, and almost immediately I returned I was on a fatigue carrying "flying pigs" to the Russian Trench Mortar.
