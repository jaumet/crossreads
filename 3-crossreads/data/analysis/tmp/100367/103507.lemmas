 The voyag of which I write was one of at least 60 day at sea , and not one vessel of ani descript was sight dure that time . Consequ , one take note of bird , weather , sunset , c. on such occas . One except calm day in mid ocean when the water were asleep , the steamer stop for some caus or other , and the Albatross were just swim and fli around the stern of the ship , enjoy the morsel of food thrown to them by the men . It was an extraordinari sight , and remind one of the swan as they glide on the quiet water of the pond at Botan Garden of our citi , when the children throw food to them . Then there is the Petrel , Cape Pigeon , and other sea bird the name of which are unknown to me . As we were about 4 day off the land , and near our first port of call , the Fli Fish made their appear . Rise on the crest of a wave , they would fli some 50 yard befor drop to water again . I am told that they fli till their wing or fin get dri , when they immedi fall to the water again . The porpois also made their appear leap from the water , and swim alongsid the ship , as if challeng to race . Whale also were seen to spout , but at a consider distanc away . Another interest item is the phosphor in the sea water , which of cours is onli seen at night . Peculiar matter this is , shine like numer firefli as it pass away from the ship 's side . In the shower of the Bathroom , if one chanc to indulg at night time , the phosphorus fall like spark to the floor .
