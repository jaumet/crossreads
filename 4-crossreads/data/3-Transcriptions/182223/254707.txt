<p>Monday 18&nbsp;October 1915&nbsp;<br />Up at 6-30 a.m. Wrote some sheets to the girls&nbsp;<br />After breakfast walked along the Anzac beach, climbed the hill to the Artillery Head Quarters. Met Col. Chas Cox. Spent the morning with him going through the trenches on the right flank of the position. Was at the most advanced posts with the men of the L.H. Regiments. Spoke with them. Examined the Turkish positions with periscopes, looked through the loopholes, straight on to the Turkish loopholes and sand bags, in some places but 40, 50, or 60 yards distant. Wonderful series of&nbsp;trenches on both sides. Great men each to exist &amp; fight for so long at this game&nbsp; Afternoon same experience.&nbsp;Great shooting from large &amp; small weapons of both British &amp; Turks. Fired about 40 rounds out of raise [?] rifles at the Turkish loopholes. Gen Ian Hamilton hands over command today.</p>
