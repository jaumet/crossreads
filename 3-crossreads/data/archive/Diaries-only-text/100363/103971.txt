Went to Zernukah - a native village a few miles from Headquarters. Beautiful weather favored an enjoyable trip - made a trifle exciting by the Ford getting stuck in the mud. We requisitioned the energies of some passing bedouins and soon got on the road again.
Zernukah like many other similar villages is built on a hill slope, its approaches being hedged by fine avenues of Cacti. The Sheik gave us all assistance possible, and all the rest of the indolent ragged population, and the ever accompanying crowd of small boys joined in. I had the 2nd Regiment paraded through the narrow laneways and in many other pictorial sittings. It is amusing what the troops will do for the camera. The various brigades have been marshaled
