<p>we were informed that we could not go through the Canal, as it was too dangerous, the Turks being pretty close and intermittently making rushes to try &amp; cross, though they seemed only half-hearted about it. The result was that we entrained at Suez &amp; came on to Cairo that way. The Railway runs right along the canal almost all the way to Ismaila, where we branch off to Cairo, &amp; though it was night when we went through, we could see plainly (it was moonlight) the Indians &amp; New Zealanders entrenched on both sides of the Canal. It seemed to me a funny thing that some 2300 soldiers should make that journey as we did, through hostile country, without even one round of ammunition. Why, had half a dozen Turks managed to reach the line, they could have held up our train &amp; given us a torrid time, &amp; we could have done nothing in return. However they didn't, &amp; I suppose we can consider ourselves lucky. It may seem funny me commenting on the arrangements made by the Authorities, but it is just as things strike me &amp; most likely would strike hundreds of others.
