In the days that are to come
We've left our dear old homeland,Our parents, sweethearts, all,We could not stay while every day,Would see our comrades fallThe glorious ambition,Which spares not friend or foeHas dared our might, so now to fightAustralians all, we go
Ch.So farewell my sunny landAnd farewell love to youOn land or sea, it seems to meI see your eyes of blue.But though my country claims my heartAnd lives maybe of someThere's a happy day not far awayIn the days that are to come
There's times when hearts are burdenedAnd fortune seems unkindAnd memorys bring a cruel stingTo every anxious mind"Tis you who fight the battleWho watch and wait and prayAnd so for you we'll dare & doUntil the happy day.
