It was more interesting for a time traveling through a canal instead of just open sea.  But soon lost interest.  It is mostly open sand instead of sea.  A "Teare" every few miles.  A lot of wireing & trenches on the Asiatic side.  Reached port Suez about 3 & left at 6.  Anchored well out in the Bay so could not see much of it.  Agricultur & Accountancy classes as usual.
