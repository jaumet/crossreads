<p>Sunday Mar 23<br/>We expect to reach Melbourne early tomorrow morning. We had Breakfast in Isolation &amp; just as we'd finished the S.M.O. strolled in. "Hello: he said, "are you still working here? About 380 are getting off tomorrow, so we shall travel very light round to Sydney. They say we are not going to stay to take on coal &amp; water, but are going straight on to Sydney as soon as we have dropped the Troops. I hope so, as we shall get Home all the quicker then.<br/>I wrote a letter to B.E. &amp; one to Mother &amp; Co, &amp; sent them wires. Gave 'em to Lakin to post. After Tea we had a Farewell Gathering in Suswy's Cabin. Len Read, Snowy, "Gib", Maj. Crow, Paddy Burke &amp; the 2nd Steward were there. We actually had two Bottles of Whisky.<br/>Mon. Mar 24<br/>Passed in between the Heads at 6.30 &amp; dropped anchor off Portsea at 7 a.m. The country is very pretty around here, &amp; the Buildings in Isolation look quite comfortable. Posstill, Jennings, Lakin, Len Read, "Snowy" Martin, Maj. Crow &amp; a number of others went ashore, so our Ships' Staff is now very much deleted. The little whisky I had last night did not agree with me at all, &amp; I suffered for it during the Day. We took a supply of Fresh meat &amp; other supplies aboard. One of the crew on one of the Tugs was wearing a 'Flu mask &amp; his appearance caused quite an exciting flutter among the Diggers.<br/>We left Melbourne about 10 p.m. &amp; are now on the Final Lap.  Received wire from Mother saying they were well.</p>
