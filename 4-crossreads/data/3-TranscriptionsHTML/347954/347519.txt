<p>Continue from Xmas Card enclosed, 2/5/1915.<br/>Sunday again (8th day of fight.)</p>
<p>Big gun fight has been in progress since early morn &amp; in the distance can be heard the large guns of the British squadron some miles down the peninsula south of observation station Kabe Tepe.</p>
<p>The roar of guns is terrific &amp; the contrast from our position of a few days ago is pronounced.</p>
<p>Today our Naval Corp sent across to the north end of peninsula small body of men to destroy an observation post which was doing a deal of good to the enemy gunners.  The raid was successful as I noted a large number of prisoners at the H.Q. &amp; also a number were killed.</p>
<p>The big 11 inch guns of the Goebin are still active &amp; throw great projectiles right across the peninsula at our transports &ndash; all to no purpose &ndash; our life appears to be charmed &amp; our luck everlasting.  In the field out beyond the 7th battalion I came on an awful looking trench caused through one of these shells falling short &amp; exploding under ground.  It easily would bury three men comfortably &ndash; Here also a number of graves show the last resting place of a company of infantry.</p>
