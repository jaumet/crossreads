 strike any more days like the 19th &amp; 20th of July. It is embedded in my mind. Of course, this was an exception, it may be quiet now for some weeks. We make our own fire &amp; cook our meals. It is our home, of course, we have to keep our eyes open when shells are flying round. During the afternoon I went down to the front line with two New Zealanders. The trenches are well built here, looked through a Periscope &amp; saw the German trenches, they were about 300 yds. away. 
 Snipers played hell during the night, we could hear the bullets whizzing past our dug-out, no casualties in the night. It is very hard to realize that some of my pals in the 30th Battalion have been killed. I was speaking to Eric Leask a few days ago at [blank] now he is in his grave. Roy Woller, a friend of Mrs. Bolten buried him. Still living in our dug-out &amp; all at work making it very comfortable. Our breakfast lately has been porridge &amp; bacon. Dinner roast beef &amp; potatoes &amp; a good cup of tea.  It is about time the cooks of our Unit learnt the way to make a decent cup of tea. Tea. Stewed Prunes, boiled rice for tea. It is like a picnic but of course we never knew when a rush of patients will occur. We were all scared during the night as bullets were whizzing round our dug-out,   Luckily there were no casualties during the night. Two men killed on the 24th inst. 2 a.m. Just taken 3 patients along the Sap to the main road where motors are stationed. In the portion that we are looking after there has only6 been 7 casualties in 4 days, thank God that this has been so. Shells are flying over our dug-out &amp; although they are bursting a long way off, none of us feel very brave. At the present time I am not on speaking terms with my underclothes. My blanket is almost alive with them, so I am evidently in for a rough time tonight. Its all in the game so its no use growling. Nic Coxan who hurt his leg in Egypt is one of our merry party. He wrote to you whilst living in the dug-out.
