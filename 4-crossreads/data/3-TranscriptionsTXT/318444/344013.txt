 Sun Aug 11th Moved forward tonight to gullies near Lihons &amp; n.e. of Rosieres. 
 Mon Aug 12th:- Mick Carmody &amp; Evans killed today by a shell. Rsm Robertson had his ankle shattered by Colonel Sasse's groom letting a rifle go off. The hostile 'planes are laying plenty of eggs around us at night. Owing to the casualties of the 2nd &amp; 3rd Brigades the 1st division is too weak to do a divisional stunt. 
 Thurs 15th Aug:- Moved back at 7pm 
 to bivouacs along railway line between Vauvillers &amp; Harbonnieres. "Fritz" giving his usual free issue of aerial bombs tonight. He must not like getting his "knock-back" for 11 miles.
