how long we will be here but not very long I hope, I never saw such mud or imagined it.
And I hope we'll go to some warmer place before long.  I haven't had a letter for ages, just as well perhaps as they would have been the finishing touch.  But I love to hear from you & to know how you are.
I am very well which surprises me very much considering the circumstances but you don't know how I wish the damned thing was over.  I can't write decently so will close.  Everything, earth, air & me insides are all a quiver with the guns, I feel like a jelly.  My love to Mac, the Boss, Graham & all at dear old Tog.
A merry Christmas, I'll be thinking of you good & hard.  Will write soon.
YoursWilkie
