 Friday 16 November 1917 On duty "Conaught" 8.30 a.m.!!  S. in charge a fault finder &amp; non-worker, waded on at tidying beds, 10 a.m. tea then dressings till 1.30 p.m., 5 to 8 p.m. tidied, etc. Feel tired but getting stronger.  Matron tells S. in C. "not to work me too hard".  Was there ever such a considerate woman in a position like this I wonder? Dressings are a sadness &amp; such good quiet boys, not a murmur &amp; not an untidy bed yet several are I fear maimed for life &amp; for what?  In a counter attack by Turks we have lost badly in men &amp; our Australians too. 8 p.m. went with S. Lee to concert in Surtees Hall, fair &amp; crowded with English soldiers.
