<p>Saturday 17th<br/>Weather very boisterous &amp; barometer lowest since we left. As very heavy weather expected there are no parades &amp; all men have been ordered off the top decks to their troop decks. Further good war news announced.</p>
<p>Storm increased and a furious gale blowing from S.W. High seas broke over the bow after the ship had risen on a high wave &amp; plunged down into the next. <strike>The</strike> We had a good time looking for the waves coming over the bow &amp; at times the blue of the waves rising right over the bow could be seen. The weather did not moderate all day. Just on darkness we saw a cargo steamer hove to. We past this as we were going at a good pace.</p>
<p>Turned in as usual though weather boisterous.</p>
<p>Sunday 18th<br/>The lights looked very pretty as we entered into the Bay. <strike>The</strike> Woke at 4 a.m. owing to rain dripping on me &amp; heard chaps calling us to get up &amp; see Cape Town. Could see very high hills through mist &amp; soon a searchlight was directed on us. We gradually moved in took on a pilot, turned about a good bit &amp; anchored in the outer bay. Had breakfast and then with two tugs moved into berth.</p>
<p>The bay is like a semi circle with a breakwater poking out from one side. Behind this is a series of piers like sketch. The Table Mount rises up straight ahead of us, &amp; with tracks showing on sides &amp; with a cloud (the "cloth") over the top it presents a great picture. Two high hills on the right &amp; one of the left of the table make a great background for the town which lies around the beach directly at the foot of the hills</p>
