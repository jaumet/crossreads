One boxing bout was very funny 4 of them were blind folded it was very amusing to see the way each would hit out &amp; swing round as soon as they touched one another. &ndash; The referee got mixed up among them for some minutes &amp; had rather a rough time of it. The weather has been lovely but a little rain fell this morning for the first time for a few days. Prior to day our sailing average fell to 280 miles per diem but has now again pulled up to her 310 the falling off was due to a defective boiler but is now O.K.<br/>25th  Saturday Very quiet day had [indecipherable] given by the A.M.C. which was very good indeed.<br/>27th Finished up the boxing tournament &amp; out of 3 events the Div.
