<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>In answer to your letters of 29.4.18, 5.5.18, 12.5.18, you do not know how delighted we are to hear of your visits &amp; visitors.  You know we are having rather good times in that way except that we do not visit people but places of interest.  I remember Mrs. Darnley &amp; I remember you telling me that Mrs. Peterson had asked you over long long ago.  Do you visit by the Trap &amp; pony or Tram &amp; shanks.  Now, Mum, as for the scheme of adopting a little Girl, I am thinking Etta is right.  There is this against it.  She will have to be looked after if you take ill &amp; Girls are a nuisance generally.  If she be about 10 years</p>
