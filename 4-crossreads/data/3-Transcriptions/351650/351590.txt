<p>shall answer all the questions you put in your last letters to me.</p>
<p>To begin with in one of them, you roused my curiosity by saying that Katherine has somehow given you rather a shock:  you went on to say what a good job it is letters to men on active service are not censored:  and then you say you won't write what caused you the shock in case your letter falls into other hands than mine:  a stimulated curiosity caused like that is a rotten thing to have, as it allows the imagination scope for rioting, so much for that.</p>
<p>I noted little Tommy Gibbons has enlisted &amp; gone off.  Why, it only seems the other day I remember him as a boy, so I can hardly imagine him as a soldier.</p>
<p>Yesterday I had a letter from Jim Ayre from Egypt, poor old Jim, I think he's rather fed up with being a soldier.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear your ears have been on the rampage once more.  Keep me posted as you suggest as to their condition, and I'll bring out the latest in ear trumpets.  Its rather rum, but we shall have to pass the ear trumpet back &amp; fore when we talk as I'm almost stone deaf in my right ear, but its better since Hunter Tod, a specialist I was under at the London Hospital when a student, did some operation last month to the back of my nose.</p>
<p>Farewell, Mrs John for today:  best love &amp; wishes to John, little John &amp; to you,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>John Chute Ellis.</p>
