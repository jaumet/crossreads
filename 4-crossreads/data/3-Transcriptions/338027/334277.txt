<p>Friday, 27th November, 1914<br/>Fearfully hot day, typical Red Sea, muggy &amp; close.  All engineers &amp; firemen knocked up.</p>
<p>Passed islands known as twelve apostles.</p>
<p>Men complaining of headaches, it is just stifling working 'tween decks.  On guard again, worst yet experienced, owing to heat.</p>
<p>Engineers absolutely beaten temperature below 135 in engine room.</p>
<p>Saturday, 28th November, 1914<br/>Like a clap of thunder came the shock of the voyage to us.  We heard the sudden news that we were to disembark on Tuesday next at Alexandria, Egypt &amp; there complete our training at Cairo.  The men were dumbfounded as every man expected to be going home for Xmas.  Although it upsets all my plans I am rather glad we are going to Egypt it is a country I always wanted to see.  The col. made a speech at concert at night.</p>
