<p>March 14th.<br/>Estaires bombarded. The shells landed right in about the college that our C.C.S. was in about ten month ago.</p>
<p>The little girls who lived in the house that Capt W. was billeted in, were, one of them killed and the other wounded. Had a run out to Gandesvelte with two patients to a C.C.S. In wending our way up by Mont des Cats, the way that the houses were situated there gave one the impression that it was like Katoomba and going up the Blue Mountains  When I got back to the C.C.S. we got word the place had ceased to be a D.R.S. and we are to take on our work as a C.C.S. again.</p>
<p>Great hub bub in the whole establishment except the O.T.</p>
<p>March 24th.<br/>On night duty. A very poor class of surgeon we have here at present</p>
<p>Bailleul has been bombarded worst than ever this last week  The old spire of the steeple has been knock away.

<p>It is said that this gun which Fritz is firing into</p>
