<p>small city about 30,000 inhabitants and is divided into three quarters &ndash; American, Spanish, and Niggers. It was intended by the Americans to be a health resort but the extreme heat is doubtless against it becoming popular as such.<br/>The houses all along the Canal Zone are built on the similar lines bungalow style, with wire gauze covering the doors, windows and verandahs, to keep out the mosquitoes and other tropical pests. These, however, have been practically exterminated by the Americans otherwise it would be hard for white people to live. The mosquitoes and yellow fever killed the French attempt to put the canal through years ago and caused the Americans a lot of trouble and expense before they could make substantial headway. Before leaving these parts it might be as well to place on record our "catastrophe" in the fruit bying venture. Bananas, oranges, etc., grow in such quantities in these localities that we thought it would be a good scheme to make a big collection &ndash; each unit separate &ndash; for the purpose, of buying a good stock of fruit. The sum of &pound;45-7/- was collected for this purpose and we had visions of a ship being specially chartered to bring all this fruit we thought this money would procure for us. Bananas especially are very cheap a big bunch for from 6d to 9d. imagine our surprise and disappointment when all that came aboard were a small number of oranges only, the price of each orange worked out at between 3 pence and 4 pence and most of them were dry and unpleasant to eat. Talk about being "rooked" they say some of the "heads" of course &ndash; did make a jolt (and a big profit) of it. The natives here are very clever at charging exorbitant prices no matter what they sell. Anyhow it was an experience which ended in laughter by the victims of their unprofitable investment, the following day, Tuesday, about 5 p.m. we made another start on our long journey and passed between a large breakwater and the mainland into the Carribean Sea,</p>
