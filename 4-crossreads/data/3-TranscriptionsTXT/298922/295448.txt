 SHELLAL 
 The Turksare better diggers than we are at present. We occupy what was once their Field Hospital. Big Crescent made of White Stones like rather worn Funk holes &amp; so suffer casualties. 
 [This sentence crossed through.] Turkswere reported in front early this morning but turned out to be PELICANS feeding on the plain when day light broke. 
 Your Parcel of Vegetables from Mutual Store arrived safely tonight, many thanks. 
 Jim Ayre is in my Brig. having a crack, he is pretty fit still &amp; just had some news of Jean &amp; Lucy. POLL DAY held in my Dug Out I.W.W. versus WIN THE WAR PARTY.
