<p>applied to the gun. Gunner Freddy King was wounded slightly yesterday afternoon.<br/>At 11am a determined attack was made by the Imperial Division on Achi Baba. We had instructions to stand by in case we should have to prevent any reinforcements attempting to reach the enemy forces there. As I write there is the continual boom boom of heavy guns and flashes all over the far slopes. There are a number of the Australian and NZ forces helping the British Imperial men there and in other attacks on the same position. Their behaviour is spoken of in the highest of terms of all the British Leaders.<br/>In the afternoon we received instructions to engage the Turks at our end so it would prevent them from sending any reinforcements along towards Achi Baba. Several parties went out &ndash; one on our right flank</p>
