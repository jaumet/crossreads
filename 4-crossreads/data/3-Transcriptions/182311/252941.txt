<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Entering Enemy Trenches</u>:&nbsp; First lie up for nights under his parapet and learn his habIts - by listening you can judge with reasonable accuracy his method of holding, his strength and habits, choose to enter in a place or at a time when no one is about and work away always securing your retirement and marking your gap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Return journey to be accomplished as carefully as journey out (for instance Burglar&#39;s methods) information secured is useless when enemy is aware that we have it, in fact it is dangerous as he may guess our plans and provide against it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter trench cautiously and then advise the posts that you are in.&nbsp; Every man should be examined for information and if not asked should insist on telling <u>all</u> he saw and heard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Aids to Direction</u>:&nbsp; Know your s tars.&nbsp; When going out notice which side of your face the wind blows on.&nbsp; Pick up landmarks, as salients and re-entrants in the wire, trees, ditches, craters, and if lost, lie down and wait until many verey lights have been sent up.&nbsp; Usually the British line is quiet and dark, but the German uses lights throughout the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Patience</u>:&nbsp; A scout&#39;s most useful qualification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Communication</u>.&nbsp; To be made as silently as possible by pressure of hand and by the use of string signals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Action on Meeting Enemy Patrol</u>.&nbsp; If fighting patrol avoid them, go back and <sub>^</sub><sup>Secure</sup> machine gun fire about the spot.&nbsp; If reconnaissance patrol avoid them - they will probably do the same if they see you.&nbsp; If it looks an easy snap attack them, but remember you are armed for defence and have only a few bombs and no long range weapons.</p>
