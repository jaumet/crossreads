<p>what they are.&nbsp; On my first visit, the links and the last few hundred</p>
<p>yards of the road were two feet under snow and greens were only</p>
<p>distinguishable from fairways (or bunkers for that matter) by the tops of</p>
<p>the flags which in most cases were visible.&nbsp; Rain however soon moved the</p>
<p>snow and we were able to play within 6 days.&nbsp; The Club House is a very</p>
<p>commodius affair and hung round the walls are the pictures usually to be</p>
<p>found in Golf Club Houses.&nbsp; With a view to bar-profits the course has</p>
<p>been arranged so that the 9th hole as well as the first - is quite near to</p>
<p>the Club House.&nbsp; The Links by the way, are out of the Principality of</p>
<p>Monarco but are owned and maintained by the Prince at what must be</p>
<p>enormous expense considering that all the soil for the fairways and greens</p>
<p>has to be carted up there.&nbsp; I heard that the Links when completed had</p>
<p>cost him with the Club House, &pound;70,000 but as this is only heresay I cannot</p>
<p>vouch for the information which however is quite likely as he must have</p>
<p>had to blast away a lot of mountains and things to make the links possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Casino, which to most people is the first thing of</p>
<p>interest in Monte Carlo, is a beautiful piece of architecture right on</p>
<p>the cliff&#39;s edge and surrounded by well kept gardens, promenades, etc.</p>
<p>A subterranean passage takes one to the Hotel de Paris on the adjacent</p>
<p>corner.&nbsp; The main entrance to the Casino opens into a large vestibule</p>
<p>similar to the vestibule at the Sydney Town Hall&frac12;&nbsp; On the left are the</p>
<p>two gaming rooms, each with eight or nine tables round which the punters</p>
<p>crowd from morning to night.&nbsp; Troops of all nationalities are forbidden</p>
<p>entrance to these rooms during xxx play and the Prince also forbids</p>
<p>admission to his subjects.&nbsp; To the right of the vestibule are the cloak</p>
<p>rooms, refreshment rooms etc.&nbsp; whilst to the right front is the entrance</p>
<p>to the Theatre.&nbsp; This little theatre contains some wonderful decorative</p>
<p>work including paintings on walls and oilings by world famous artists.</p>
<p>The seating accomodation would by no means pay for the upkeep of the</p>
