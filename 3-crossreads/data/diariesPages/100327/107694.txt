sea dashing over pier and carried some canteen stores stacked down there. Tent flapping terrifically. Rain teemed till 0000, but slept fitfully until then Suddenly awakened by other occupants just in time to grab tent pole. Held on there for 20 minutes while others got on to tent pegs. Bitterly cold and got little rest until 0800, bad with dysentery

Up at 0800. Sunday. Saw it snow for first time falling in driving flakes hills covered with snow. Biting wind. Took pick shovel and trenched mess and built up a dry floor inside. Spent day huddled over brazier. 151 Bde a lot of 54th Division leaving peninsular. Waterbarge driven ashore and things smashed up. Went down to beach at 1700 and found things in a terrible state. Great seas dashing over the dummy Dreadnaught and crashing in beyond breakwater Road awash and pier apparently not existent
