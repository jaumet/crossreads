  
 Well I think I have blown out of news, & don't know what to write to the others now.  Give them all my love.  I hope you have had more than one spell like the short one at Tarella & that the Pater keeps going along steady. [Four lines deleted]. I asked Kingy to send a cable to you when he went to London but havnt seen him since he came back.  I havnt had any cables since I got to France, evidently since I cabled & it was posted as they all are to England you all rushed to the conclusion I was knocking about there, instead of going straight into the line.  I am not very keen about leave plenty in the battery to interest me.  I hope all you folks are O.K. My love to them all. Affectionately, Geoff
