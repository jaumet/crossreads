<p>4th<br/>Just 12 months to-day since England declared war on Germany.  Went for a walk over to the Royal Flying Corps Headquarters, and had a good look round the aeroplanes.  Afterwards had a long ramble round the coast to a big camp, where there are thousands of troops, Sikhs, Ghurkas, &amp; Tommies.</p>
