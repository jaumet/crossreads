Hammond got a razor bladed dagger which will save his life if he always wears it & never puts it in a sheath! Most likely he'll cut his liver in two with it by accident (or someone elses.) Ours & N Zs only troops to get ashore. Must be over 12000 others on boats in the roads. Bad doings in the town. "White Coolies" general name for Aussies & N Zs. Much rough stuff, Funny to see our chaps coming in in their little short shorts after going to sleep in the Gutters of the town. The Bushmen will steal your teeth while you sleep.
