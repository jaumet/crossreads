Firing Line. Le Sars
13/2/17 Heavy bombardment on right during afternoon and some 5.9's and shrapnel dropped hereabouts. Two Huns tackled one of our planes and brought it down with machine gun fire behind our lines. Lloyds excellent artillery covering us and does nice shooting. As some of his snipers come out early and hamper our patrols I arranged for a battery to shoot on No Mans Land and search it with a creeping barrage back on to his front line. The relief was late in arriving owing to congested traffic and slippery roads. Colonel Slahe came in about 7.30 p.m. and took over. Relief complete about 10.30 pm and we set off for the Camp. A long, long way through the ruins of Martinpuich and along duckboards until we reached the Villa Station . Got on our horses then and trotted back to camp. Stewart had a great fall owing to his horse stalling but was unhurt. It was 2.30 before I got to bed. Hot meal and blankets waiting for the men at the huts. Heavy dry cold
