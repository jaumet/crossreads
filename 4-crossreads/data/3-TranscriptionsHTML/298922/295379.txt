<p>Thursday 22 February 1917</p>
<p>Khamsin again &amp; to show what this means &ndash; some Palms are now covered up to their FRONDS [see image for drawing] with Sand &ndash; where before they were on the flat &ndash; as I said before it is like the hummocks of Warrnambool.</p>
<p>Expect to go to Cairo tomorrow, am quite excited about it.</p>
<p>[The following sentence crossed through]<br/>In case my other notes miss you, will tell you again, you can address me as MAJOR from 2/2/17.</p>
<p>The WIND exposes many odd things on an old Battle field &ndash; this evening I picked up a Bayonet, some cartridges, 2 full TINS of Bully beef some Picket Ropes etc. etc. like finding Black fellows skin on the Sandhills after a dust storm.</p>
