<p>He could give us no satisfaction but promised to enquire into the matter on his return to Headquarters. Personally I applied to be attached to the Battalion with the Regimental Detail. In my opinion it is a much preferable position than in a Field Ambulance. He treated my request the same as the other and promised to let me know later through our C.O.<br/>It is rumoured that the Battalion will leave here during the week, part going on Tuesday and the remainder following later. They are going to Maitland to join the Division. I very much doubt the truth of this as I regard it as unlikely that the Battalion would be moved when there are so many in hospital.<br/>We had our first death in the hospital on Friday morning. The patient, a young chap named McKinnon, was admitted suffering with measles and he subsequently developed bronchial pneumonia. We generally send bad patients to the local hospital but this young fellow took bad so suddenly that it was dangerous to remove him by the time his case assumed a serious nature.<br/>Myself and two others as well as the doctor were with him all night but despite all our efforts he died at 8 O'clock in the morning. He was unconscious all night and never regained consciousness, passing off very quietly.</p>
