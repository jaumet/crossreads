<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>I received your letter yesterday dated 20th Jan also the catalogue of the wool sale from Father. 21 3/4 is some price! My Word!. Also today <s>your</s> cake came and its A1. It had a rather rough passage as it has been following us round in the rain, and it was a bit squashed - but its quite OK and we can eat the very broken pieces with a spoon. Those two shirts from Mrs Busby came, and will be very nice when it getsa bit warmer, especially as they have pockets and shoulder straps on; which I do like. Got two parcels from the LHCF too. I wrote to you last Mother on the the 8th March just after I came back from the Flying Corps, since then we have been up in the mountains in a bit from Jericho, doing outpost for the infantry &amp; had a rather rough time as it was raining and bitterly cold but when we came in they made it up for us as we are now in a German barracks in a Christian village about a mile from Bethlehem. We expected only to be here the one night, as we were going on a big stunt, but it has been posponed on account of a river in flood - perhaps you will understand this.</p>
