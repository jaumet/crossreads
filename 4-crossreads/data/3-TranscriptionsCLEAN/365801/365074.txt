At sea22.6.16
My dear JudgeAm now crossing Meditteranean [sic] in the direction of France.  Delighted to get away from the filth flies & niggers for a while.  Egypt is a vile place at this time of year & we are all very glad to be out of it.  At present the ship is too full to have any parades so we just don't.  The table living is excellent, and after having sand flies in everything for so long we know how to appreciate it.I am looking forward to a good time in France (barring accidents of course).  It seems to be a mere circuit [sic] compared with the Peninsular.  Was getting a bit stale on things in general in Egypt but am as fit as ever now & can play a knife & fork with anyone.  All the men are very fit.
Best love to Mrs Ferguson & DorothyYours everCR Lucas
