The harbour is full of shipping  - vessels belonging to neutral countries conspicuous by their prominent display of nationality both by flag &  painted lettering.Transports crowded with Troops are coming in thick and fast. 3 boatloads of Australians have arrived so far today each containing about 2,000 men.Managed to get into signalling communication with them this afternoon. Hills rise all round the harbour & near the city are houses can be seen on the slopes nestling among the forest green.Orders received to-night that we are to commence disembarkation to-morrow & establish field hospital
