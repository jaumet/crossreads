<p>a flower garden all around.  We have a big orchard on the main land &amp; I suppose that we will be able to buy some fruit.  The government Launch goes to town twice a day so we can always get anything we want.  Bill has just been nabbed to go &amp; help the Sergeant while Ellis &amp; I are sitting in the Cottage.  We will all get our turn though.  We have two bonza Captains &amp; one Lieutenant &amp; 3 Sergeants all good men.  Capt. Bray the Commander is always smiling &amp; walks about &amp; talks to us just like a private.  He is with us 4 days &amp; the other 3 days he is at L'pool.  We have about 150 patients &amp; there are some Characters amongst them.  One of them just passed me on the way up to their camp.  He had a linen collar, a pair of shorts &amp; a wristlet watch.  While we were waiting at L'pool, the patients ran along the line &amp; caught three goats but they let them go again just before we left L'pool.  They tied kerosene tins on the back of the train with wire &amp; had the outside of the railway carriages festooned with sanitary paper.  We have just got a supply of meat so we will not have bully beef to-night.  It is beautiful up here.  The views are glorious &amp; at 4 o'clock every day we have the baths to ourselves.  Of course we can go in any time for a shower but the baths will do me.  I am writing in Ted Grundy's notebook.  He is a cousin of Mrs. Clarke's next-door neighbour &amp; a lady I know well.  Billy also knows her.  Casson is here but is a bit of a loafer but the other fellows are shaking him up about it.  We will not be getting any leave except our final of 4 days &amp; then we will be off to Malta direct.</p>
