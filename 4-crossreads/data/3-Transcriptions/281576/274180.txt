<p>JAN. 28. contd.  After Tea a few parcels came along.  I got one from France containing socks &amp; a woollen Helmet, just the two things I wanted most.  Good old France.  Wrote Letter to Kath Williams telling her about poor old Peter.</p>
<p>Mon. 29.  Last night Tommy Ross took on the calling up &amp; I took his place in his squad with Colley, Bill Mac &amp; George Symister.  We didn't have a call all night.  This morning Tommy Ross &amp; I tossed up to see who should come out to Thistle Trench. I lost.  We came out at 2 oclock.  The 53 Batt. are holding this part of the Line &amp; we are in a good deep dug out with the Details, Scotty Sefton &amp; Jim Harrop.  They made us some Tea as soon as we arrived &amp; we had a snack.  Were just sitting back having a quiet smoke when a chap arrived with a broken arm.  We put him on a stretcher &amp; carried him through to Needle Trench where Billsy May &amp; party are. His name was J. Rea. 53 Batt.<br/>When we got back to the dugout Scotty made us some more Tea &amp; heated some Pork &amp; Beans &amp; Bully Beef &amp; we had the first warm meal since Dinner time last Wed.  Now we are sitting round hoping we don't get another carry before daylight.</p>
<p>Tues. 30.  Slept soundly &amp; warm till 9.30.  Didn't have a carry all night.  "Praise God from whom all blessings flow".  Got the old "Primus" going, made some Tea &amp; warmed a Tin of Pork &amp; Beans.  Then I had a shave, which made me feel quite fresh.  About Dinner time Fritz set up a terrific Bombardment.  Shells were flying in all direction &amp; we got prepared for a busy time.  About 2 p.m. the first case arrived, shell wound in the R. Elbow.  We carried him thro' to Needle Trench &amp; when we returned 2 more stretcher cases were waiting.  Capt. Cosgrove got some of the 53rd to give us a hand in with 'em.  When we got to Needle Trench</p>
