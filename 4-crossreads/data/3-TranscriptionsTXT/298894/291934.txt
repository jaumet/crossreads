a large number of head cases, many have lived but a few have died from shock.  Some few of the wounded are very young 17 & 18 & with their English faces look mere boys.
Tuesday 8th
Arrived at Alexandria during the afternoon and I had a restless sleep through the winch working etc.
Wednesday 9th
Unloaded all our wounded with motors finishing about 7 P.M.    We were given leave at night but not until we struggled for it & several had cleared off.  Uptown there were hundreds of newly arrived Australians doing the sights & getting into trouble in the usual way.   They were eager for news & many were the gory tales told to them by our chaps and others.
Thursday 10th
We were given leave during the afternoon much to our satisfaction.   My first day was to get my watch repaired which cost me 12 P.T. after a great deal of bargaining then I bought two cushion covers & blouses to send home & several postcards & photos packing the whole up with some curios in the form of coins bullets etc.   From here I went to see Lance who was camped at Sidi Bishr returning to the ship about 10.30 P.M.
Friday 11th
On board all day & did the town in the evening.   Spent about an hour looking through a curio shop wishing for the necessary to indulge in some.
Saturday 12th
The next few days were a succession of alarms disappointments & a display of mismanagement.
