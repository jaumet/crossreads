escent Camp team, scores 53 to nil. Weather still holding remarkably fine, whats more it is far from cold, all I have worn so far is just a singlet occasionally a cardigan jacket after tea, in addition to my tunic.
This morning after yesterdays strenuous scrambling I am as sore as can be, but I feel as fit as a fiddle otherwise, I am in the best condition now I think as I have ever been since I enlisted, I am feeling tip top am fast getting my wind back. Instead of going on parade this morning 7 of us were selected as being the best rifle shots in the Coy. Bill Cameron, Patrick Rusty Egan, Jack Hayes, Raffan, Len I, we got a lot of ammunition took a note over to Capt Booth whose Coy was using the range, asking him to let us have a couple of targets to try our rifles on, all right he said, so we started on the minature range first the whole 7 shot splendidly the bullets practically cut one another so accurate was it. We were in great spirits when we left
