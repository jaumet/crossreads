<p>The Military Fever prevalent in Melb recently &amp; its result</p>
<p>After great consideration<br/>With due deliberation<br/>And much [indecipherable]<br/>I sent my nomination<br/>Then came expectation<br/>Followed by realization<br/>And then consultation<br/>With heads of our nation<br/>I'm a soldier in creation</p>
<p>On board the Karroo<br/>The home of [indecipherable] stew<br/>We sail to our station<br/>We suffer in [indecipherable] time<br/>Suffer in starvation<br/>Vaccination privation<br/>Inoculation constipation<br/>Stagnation humiliation<br/>[indecipherable] examinations &amp; then<br/>No Germanation</p>
<p>Lights out</p>
<p>I thought you were an angel dear,<br/>But now I'm sure of that,<br/>'Twas only wings were wanting,<br/>Now, I see them on your hat</p>
<p>This is the luxury of wine<br/>It touches every key of memory<br/>And stirs all the hidden sprigs of sorrow<br/>And of joy<br/>I love it for what it makes me forget<br/>And for what it makes me remember</p>
<p>Thou art the hope of my after years<br/>Sum of my winter sorrows<br/>But the years go by neath a clouded sky<br/>When shall we meet who knows<br/>Who knows</p>
