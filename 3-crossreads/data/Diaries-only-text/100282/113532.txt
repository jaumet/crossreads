society fit inmates for such rottenholes. While waiting for James, I overheard an officer interrogating a German officer who was captured in last nights great raid by the 3rd 5th Div. the most successful that has ever been on the Western front, no less than 200 being snared, he was complaining bitterly of the way in which he had been robbed of a valuable gold watch chain by one of our lads he had about 2 inches of the chain left where the chap had snipped it off with a pair of wire cutters or something, he was also going sore about the way in which he said the ?B- Australians dished the wounded up also because they used cogwheels on sticks to knock old Fritzs heads off, little did he think it would recoil in their own heads for they were the first to start using these handy little weapons, some "knuckledusters" but our chaps only laughed at his tale of woe, if he took my advice he would be a little more careful about his complaints for accidents happen to these sort of men in such places.
