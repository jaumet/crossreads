<p>Motor ambulances, we never had to wait a single minute to get them away &amp; I hope the people responsible get every credit.</p>
<p>Our advanced Dressing Station is alongside of where they bury the boys &amp; its heartrending to see the dead waiting to be buried. All our Boys admit &amp; recognize we owe a debt of gratitude to the <u>Ox &amp; Bucks</u> also to a squad of New Zealand Field Ambulance men who gave a willing hand when we were all fagged &amp; weary to get the boys in.</p>
<p>22/7/16  Saturday</p>
<p>Was on duty with 3 others in the trenches from 8 am till 10 pm but we got no relief &amp; had to stay on till 6 am this morning, our relief couldn't get down to us owing to snipers &amp; machine gun fire across the road &amp; saps. killed 2 men &amp; 3 horses alongside the dressing station &ndash; Put in a very cheerful night. I don't think). Dr Minty said I could go &amp; have a good camp all day, so self &amp; 3 others got into a dug out about a mile back &amp; slept like a top till 8 pm. Very few casualties today &ndash; Some bearers went out on to no mans land &amp; got 2 men still alive one with bullet in leg &ndash; the other shell shock. Pte Hamilton said he had been over &amp; was coming back when they got him, he lay there since</p>
