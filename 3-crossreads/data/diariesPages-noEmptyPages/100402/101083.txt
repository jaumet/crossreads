Tuesday 4 June
Still glorious weather we are back at Borre, only to go up to-morrow evening for another eight days. The German prisoners who came through yesterday though very cheerful, were very poor specimens, 12th 39th Reserve divisions. The habit of "ratting" them for their personal property, disgusting to say the least, was carried out by some thoroughly. Some of the incidents were very amusing.
Wednesday 5 June
Move into the line again, to the same post as previously, Strazeele Station. At midnight we had a carry nearing the relay I was hit in the chest left side by a piece of flying metal. Narrow shave for the heart but it is only a scratch, however necessitating A.T. injection. Sent to Borre for a while.
