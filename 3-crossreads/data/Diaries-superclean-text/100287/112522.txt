our old style methods of living.
We had a stoppage this morning from 9 to 10 on account of a steam pipe blowing out in the engine room. Our firemen are giving more trouble they are I am afraid a bad lot, they threw their dinner today all over the officers saloon also heaved the pudding over the Chief Steward, some way of carrying on isn't it, the food question again, this time I am satisfied that they are in the wrong for I made enquiries saw the food for myself its practically the same as we are getting so heaven only knows what they want, it's a pity they could not have been with us for a while on Gallopili or 1916 in France, they would have known something about poor food short rations then, I don't suppose they have lived better in their life than they are now.
