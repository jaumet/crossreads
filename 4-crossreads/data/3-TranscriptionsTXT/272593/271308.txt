9.000 Stokes bombs, 10,000 MILLS No. 5, 5,000 Rifle Grenades & the same number of cartridges for them  24 boxes of Very lights & flares & numerous other small items, I am responsible for all this so you can imagine it kept me busy as the pushing parties kept on butting in & loading the wrong stuff. I told a few of them off for this, the pushing party was drawn mostly from the 3rd Batt  we had somewhere round about 150 of them & a few of the 2nd Bde. also. It kept Starkey & I pretty busy checking & counting truckloads.Saw a horse killed waggon smashed & the driver wounded this evening. A shell lobbed fair
