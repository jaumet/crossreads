  
 some days ago & I had thought it over - All the destroyers will be gone - Only the Una left under the orders of the Administrator - The military will do all the inshore jobs - What wd remain for me? - Very, very little - No I had thought of volunteering to remain another 3-4 months but decided against it  or  the end of the war - A year - too!  I've done some good work & I know my energy & willingness to go & do anything has been appreciated - Well I put  my  brains to work & got  all that washed out  - I am to remain on the Fantome - That's best I think - They are shifting - Gauntlet - (Gunner) Lane (Pay) to the Una - Some stewards & a lot of stokers & A B men - We take to Sydney - all the crooks & stiffs & rubbish & land them on the beach - The Destroyers go down too - A trusty friend will post Parts 1 & 2 - 6 & 7 of my Journal - The troops all leave inside a week - It's wash out in the Pacific I can tell you - The S.S. Navua comes from Auckland to Rabaul - 7.6 - & will shift troops - The Eastern & Matunga ditto -
