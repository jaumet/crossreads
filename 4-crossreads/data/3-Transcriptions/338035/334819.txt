<p>Found Mrs. Lund of 115 London Rd. Neath &amp; handed to them my letter of introduction from my friend Norman Farquhar.  In conversation I ascertained that they came from Ossett the town next door to Dewsbury where dad was born.<br/>Arranged to have dinner with them.<br/>To Hospital for an hour.<br/>Dinner at 1 and chatted with family, Mr. &amp; Mrs. &amp; Miss Dora Lund.<br/>Back to Hospital again with biscuits &amp; matches.<br/>One of the boys in the Hosp. died last night <strike>at Hosp.</strike> with shrapnel in lung.<br/>Left Hospital at 4.45.  Thence on to Swansea &amp; had tea near Station.<br/>Leaving belongings at Y.M.C.A. took a run out to Skeret, [possibly Sketty] a suburb.<br/>Things noticeable were selling fruit by pound, the calling of peanuts monkey nuts and the true Welsh people who contrary to my imagination were a dark skinned people <strike>liken</strike> much like French people.  Their language was impossible.  After fruit supper I turned in.</p>
<p>Sunday 10th<br/>Up early and after a clean up had to leave before breakfast.<br/>The town was hardly awake when I passed thro' and Welsh towns have that name on Sundays.<br/>Travelled by 8.45 train to Neath.<br/>Left belongings at Mrs. Lund's &amp; thence to Hospital with the New Zealander Barrington.  Took some fruit.</p>
