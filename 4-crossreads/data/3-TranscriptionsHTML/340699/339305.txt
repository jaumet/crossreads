<p>was incredibly muddy and slippery, and I noted when I got there how much in two days the scene, by reason of the ripening of the crops, had changed. The sun was playing hide and seek behind fast-moving water-burdened clouds and the effect was as changeable as a "movie". For that reason, more than the waning light, I knocked off sooner that would ordinarily have been necessary and went to see the American boys play baseball; but, when I got to the ground, they had ceased play and were very intently watching our chaps playing Australian football; a game strange to them.<br/>Our fellows, most of them wearing only boots and a pair of abbreviated knickers, were bogging in for all they were worth and the Americans were very seriously trying to get the hang of the game; asking all sorts of questions: "What's that for, now?
