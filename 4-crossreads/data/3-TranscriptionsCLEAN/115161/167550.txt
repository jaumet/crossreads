  
 not worthy of mention, but as I wish this book to contain a certain number of chapters, I fear I must inflict on my readers a few more of the petty experiences of my camp life, before passing on to the more exciting and perhaps - more interesting phases of my military career. 
 For the last few Sunday mornings in camp, an improvemnt (I should perhaps have said, an alteration) was made in our breakfast menu. We were given sausages instead of the everlasting stew. Sausages - I said - well! I mean that it was something done up small and covered with a thin skin. The allowance was two sausages per man. On one occasion I noticed a big fellow - he was a bit of a bully, and always tried to "rule the roost" - take his two and quickly cover them with mashed potato, then take two more sausages. Result of course was that the last fellow had none to collect (strange they had been counted correctly), well several fellows offered the poor chap half a sausage, and the big fellow who had collected four, even was so generous as to also offer half a one.

I decided that if I was ever near that big chap at the front, I'd keep a close watch on my rations.
