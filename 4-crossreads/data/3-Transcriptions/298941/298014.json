<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x<br/>After writing the above I suddenly saw a red cross limber passing the entrance to our grass yard. Running after I was very surprised to find Reynolds, the postman, who was on his way to collect the mail. The 3rd, I found, were not at Caestre, but back along the cobble road (Castre Cassel) the other side of the village where the lorries landed us. This village is St Sylvester Cappel.</p>
