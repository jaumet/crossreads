<p>I was also able to go through the Museum a very interesting place full of ancient pharaohs &amp; statues of all kinds, some of these are in a good state of preservation some of the statues have been patched up with plaster, huge lions caved out of black granite look well also some beautiful work in Alabaster, large jars with fancy carved stoppers, which contain the spices, which were used in the manufacture of Mummys   I should like to go there again but there is no chance we are on the move very shortly the Btn was going to hold sports to day but these have all been cancelled, &amp; hurried preparations for moving are being made   I was in Cairo yesterday</p>
