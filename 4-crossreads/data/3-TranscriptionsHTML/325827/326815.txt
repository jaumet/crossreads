<p>Dear old Waggy</p>
<p>I was a lucky man yesterday because I had 6 letters, 5 from Ol and one from you which I was exceedingly pleased to get.</p>
<p>First I am glad that you have the geometrical piece of wood off. Anyhow it is interesting to know that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the two squares of the other side. That is provided by the surgeon set it at a right angle. That helps a lot I think, square and all.</p>
<p>On the other hand I am sorry to hear you have come under the coquettish wiles of the fair sex on a motor car. Anyhow they are a good breed. Ol was telling me of a nice car trip you and she had and of tea at Edina. She seemed to enjoy it. The trips and bright company should do  you good.</p>
<p>I admit that a letter from Ol  (before she had the Viavi treatment) rather put the wind up me and I felt like coming home. I am so glad to lean from you and Daddy privately and the general tone of Ol's letters that she is so well. The other day I caught a slight cold and it at once went to bronchitis. I had my chest tapped etc by the doctor and he said I should return at once to Egypt or Australia as I could never hope to improve in France but would go up and down with the weather. I am a good deal better now and despite the Doc I hope to look after</p>
