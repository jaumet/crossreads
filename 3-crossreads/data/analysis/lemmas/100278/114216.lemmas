 it is possibl , for we are out to beat them and they are a long way from that as yet , though I 'm sure they are feel the pinch bodili , and we have the upper hand , there no one would be more pleas than I if it finish short but now we have fought this long I would like to see them beaten proper and for good . There has been a fair number of trench feet pass through here , some of them veri bad quit black . 19th Same old job again but one good thing the hard frost of last night made the mud as hard as a metal road , when I went out to have a wash this morn I found all the tap frozen so I had to go and break an inch of ice in a shell hole and duck into that . About 2 o'clock this afternoon
