May 15 Walked through lanes & byways down towards the town & then explored St Josephs Cathedral. Sorry I couldn't get up top, but all the same the lower part is beautiful & was well worth any trouble. Round 2 sides of the church & some distance from it runs a wide shady walk hemmed in on both sides by stout brick walls. From the top of the outer wall (which is 5 ft thick in one place) one can look out over the city below. Alongside the wharves were scores of fishing boats, (mostly sailors) & several liners & a Hospital ship. On one part of the wharf was a mine about 3 ft in diameter, which had been raked out of the Channel. Trains & trams were everywhere (almost as common as soldiers). Weighed myself 75 Kilos & then had a look inside the Post office.
16 Woke up during the night to the accompaniment of bombs - evidently from enemy aircraft. Am not going before todays board
