  
 We are right away to the N of New Ireland in straits called after Byron after (Admiral B) - you don't travel by night - only by day - You have a man always up at the foretop & the foretop &  the  bridge are joined up by telephone - These parts are very little visited - What impresses me is the hugeness of the pictures - the vastness of Nature's masterpieces - You can - from a boat - view the sea bottom - coral - all coral - Coral with green tipped prongs - purple tipped owls  prongs - so beautiful in life but dull grey in death - When we bathe we wear sand shoes or your feet wd soon be cut to pieces - in addition you may put your foot on a sea hedgehog & then you'll know it - One or two did that at Rabaul & where the spines entered  lay  remained dark marks - We've 2 police boys & a prisoner on board. The prisoner is said to have made 'Kiki' of his mother in law - He looks a ferocious sort of chap -
