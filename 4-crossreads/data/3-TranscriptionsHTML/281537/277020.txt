<p>10/9/15  Johnstons Jolly<br/>them calling us by our Christian names soon.  Today issued lime juice ration 1/10th of a gill to each man.  An old chap from "C" Co was acting as orderly and I gave him a tot of rum left over from yesterday.  He was greatly delighted " 'Ere's luck to yer Sir and to Orsetrilier!".  The same gentleman later on had the nosecap blown off his rifle in this evening's bombardment but escaped himself unhurt.  His lucky day!</p>
<p>11/10/15<br/>Cold as ____ &amp; pitch dark at stand to arms.  Signallers called us too early so had to freeze about for an extra half hour.  It turned out a lovely fresh morning with the sea white capped flecked.  With a telescope could see the sailors at work on the men-o'war.  Abdul was very jumpy all night and pumping in a lot of lead.  All</p>
