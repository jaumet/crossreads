<p>Christmas Day 1917.<br/>Christmas Service, held in marque, rather enjoyable &amp; impressive, I played the piano for the service. The dinner was a great success, plenty of poultry, vegetables &amp; plum pudding etc. The Sergeants acted as waiters &amp; plenty of good hearted chaff took place. Still I could not help noticing the slight depression of all, the fact is only too true &ndash; everybody is sick &amp; tired of the war &amp; we have been altogether too, long away from our homes. However we must look we must look on the bright side of things &amp; "keep smiling". In the evening a concert was held which was much appreciated by all present but it was jolly cold sitting in a tent this weather.</p>
<p>For the third time, since leaving Australia our cheery Christmas season is with us, &amp; though the world is in great trouble &amp; sorrow we shall forget our troubles &amp; celebrate the occasion with all the old cheerfulness &amp; as many of the old rites as our circumstances permitted, in this small village, in which we are billeted. We drank to success in the New Year, and a speedy return to our friends &amp; fair ones in that wonderful land of sunshine &amp; wattle. For a while we forget, the grim duty which called us away from home &amp; enjoyed ourselves.   Of course our thoughts turned to our loved ones, during the festive season.</p>
