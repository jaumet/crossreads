<p>Troops were thrown out again in the direction of El-Hisha &amp; El-Haminaln &amp; plane arrived to locate objective it is concealed by a hod &amp; after searching all the afternoon the first Regt found it. Pard Mastard and I was told off to dismantle the engine but it being too dark we had to leave it till the morning, we returned to Bir-el-Abd &amp; stayed there an hour  or two then returned to the Babas &amp; turned in thoroughly done being without water in the desert for 14 hours &amp; horses longer, they wouldn't look at the stuff at the Hod.</p>

<p>Slept the sleep of the dead &amp; got up at six, fixed up the horses &amp; messed about all day leaving for Romani at 4 in the afternoon my horse was settled from the jump but luckily for me held out.  The pace was painfully slow for so many men &amp; horses were blown out reached Oghratina early in the evening &amp; sat tight for 2 hours then saddled up &amp; came right through the Bile as usual losing themselves &amp; landing out Mahamedere way &amp; expecting Tommys to open on us at any minute, got into HQ's at 9 at night to find a good stiff meal awaiting us, turned in straight away.</p>
