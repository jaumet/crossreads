<p>we are billeted in a French village about 3 miles from the sea shore, in between Etaples and Boulogne. Leave can be obtained to both places, but I have been in both several times previously so have not troubled them this time. The class of French people around here ,that is on the coast are a filthy lot. I daresay the war has made them worse, but at any time I should imagine their standard to be pretty low.
