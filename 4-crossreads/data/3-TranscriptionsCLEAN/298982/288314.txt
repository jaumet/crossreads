  
 it look quite an inferno. 
 Wed 30th We had to stand to arms at 1 am. As only just got to sleep was wild as we most were. 
 (The aeroplane which dropped the papers on Sunday night asked us Austns to come over to them & we would be well fed etc & were only mercenaries.) 
 Five dead in morgue one of them a Turk. Said to have been the Ottoman Guard who attacked on left. Drunk or partially. 250 left dead or badly wounded in front of the trenches. 
 We went into trenches in morn. Rotten trenches, shallow narrow & enfiladed on both sides. No possie supports Heavy thunder storm at night & some rain not too pleasant. Some firing at night. No rum just when needed
