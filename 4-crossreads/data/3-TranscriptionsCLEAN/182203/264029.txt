  
 I'm to leave it for him. I may not see him again this week, so shall miss my friend. This afternoon I'm to go out to Sister Ross at Ras-el-tin to meet Sister Weiss & then we three are going out somewhere. It is very lucky having a few friends about. I have written to Norman, but find out that his Camp is about 20 miles out of Alex. so unless he could come in I shall not be able to see him. Tell Alice B. I shall write to her next week. I have received a letter from Dot Swinburne, Cris O'Neil  & Miss Stirling this week - none from home
