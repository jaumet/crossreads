  
 & I went to the theatre again in the evening & on the next evening we went to see a play "A little Bit of Fluff".  It was funny & I screamed all the time.  There are absolutely no lights in Grimsby & at night time.  People have to walk about with their hands out in front of them.  Lots of people get lost & I thought I was lost for about 5 minutes when I was coming from Mrs. Melhuish's place.  Jennie was just beginning to worry when I turned up.  I came Home next day having spent a very nice time.  I arrived in camp in time for supper at 9 p.m.  Well Dad, I think I've exhausted all news & I have 22 other letters to write but they will not be done to-night.  Kind wishes to all my old Friends & trusting that you are all well, I say Goodnight. 
 Best Love From Harry
