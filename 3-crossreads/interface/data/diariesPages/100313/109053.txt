13/1/18 London
Abroad before 10 and walked through to Buckingham Palace grounds past the Queen Victoria memorial to the Mall. Then to St James Palace to see the Guardmounting. The Welsh Guard relieved the Coldstreams. Drill very good but class of man poor. A fair sized crowd of spectators. A fine sunny day but cold. Returned to hotel and read. Lunched and then caught a bus for Wandsworth and there saw Thwaites and Woolf meeting lady friends of each. Back to hotel before dinner and then by tube to Blackfriars up a black Fleet St. to the Cheshire Cheese for dinner and an interesting yarn to a grousing Canadian. An old cockatoo here who draws corks and does other things too. An assignation with J. for onze houres which failed to eventuate at all. To quiet sleep at midnight.
