  
 July, 1915 Friday 9 We are now very short handed 1800 Horses stabled to exercise feed water & groom. Carry on Instruction & find men for Guards etc:- All hands were jubilant at going to be killed & the remainder very full up of the Desert & the Stables. I have a dozen snapshots to send you of Typical scenes & some of Himself. I now have 725 Seyces to help groom & feed - not knowing much about Horses they get kicked all over the place, they learn quickly. I cannot speak anything but Koppi & Collarendabir, they speak Arabic.
