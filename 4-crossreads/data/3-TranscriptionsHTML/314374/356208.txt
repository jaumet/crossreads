<p>(24)<br/>Near to Locre was a large Convent where about fifty orphan Belgian children were looked after by the Nuns.  We used to go down here of a night and in the big school (with its darkened windows and a few candles to light it up) have quite a happy time.  The nuns could speak English and they taught the orphan children to sing "God save the King" and "Tipperary" in English.  Some of the men taught the orphan boys to box and they used to give us some fine exhibitions.  Food was very scarce but the nuns would never let us go away without giving us a drink of wine or a glass of light beer, and we returned their kindness by giving them many little things that we could spare and which were luxuries to them.  A piece of white bread was worth is [its] weight in gold to them.</p>
<p>Major Willie Redmond (who died of wounds) was buried in the convent grounds and we saw his grave.</p>
<p>It snowed nearly all the time we were here.  I was then transferred to Lewis Gun Section.</p>
<p>On 26th January we marched up to the front line again to near Ploegg Steert Wood.  We occupied the line here for nearly four weeks without a break.</p>
<p>A party of us were sent out of the line one day back to Romarin camp on fatigue.  We halted for a rest on our way out at a post known as Lancashire Farm.  Met some Aussies here who were coming in.  Got in conversation with them and they proved to be Sir William (General) Birdwood and party.  Birdwood didn't look much like a General.  He had old clothes on covered with mud, with his steel hat and gas helmet strapped on.  We saluted and had a few words with him and told him it was quiet up the line and only a few shells coming over.  I believe that he spent the whole day in the trenches inspecting and visiting the various headquarters.  Some people said that Generals never exposed themselves to danger but here is one instance.</p>
<p>For a week I was one of the food carriers up to the front line.  We (eight of us) had a dugout in the reserve trench.  As soon as it got dark we went to the cook house, where large dixies of stew and tea were strapped on our backs, and we trudged up to the communication trench about 300 yards to the front line.  At midnight we had to bring hot coffee up and again at daylight the troops' breakfast.  Then we could sleep or rest in the dugout all day.  We couldn't move about in daylight as the position was too exposed, and the men in the front line had to do without any hot food from sunrise till sundown.  One night we went up to the front line before it was quite dark and had a narrow escape.  There was an opening in the communication trench (not noticed by us at the time) on which the Germans had one of their guns trained.  this particular night, as we were passing they put a burst of shot into us.  We ducked in all directions and one of the bullets hit the steel hat of my pal, but bounced off.  Thereafter we went up no more till it was quite dark.  The cook houses were always shifting their possies, as very often the smoke would put them away and they would be blown up by the enemy shells trained on them.  It didn't matter how careful they were, the smoke from them could very often be seen by the enemy.</p>
<p>One of the Battalion cooks was "Bony" Ford from South Grafton.</p>
