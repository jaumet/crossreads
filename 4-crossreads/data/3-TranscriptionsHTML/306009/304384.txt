<p>1915<br/>July 17 Sat.<br/>Fixed a number of prints in the afternoon. Some of them I took off borrowed negatives &amp; others were given to me. Shall send all the finished articles home.<br/>Moreton Crocker (Corpl. 26th Infantry) paid me a surprise visit about 2.30 p.m. As thin &amp; talkative as ever. Has only been in Egypt a fortnight. We went out to Mena House in a Motor Ambulance &amp; then went for a tour of inspection round the Sphinx, Pyramids &amp; a couple of tombs.</p>
