I have classed my small Kit into what I can carry &amp; what throw away &amp; am already for eventualities<br/>Scribbling these notes each day keep me in touch with you, <strike>little Mother &amp; that far away dusty little town</strike> &ndash; I hope you are keeping well to meet me when I come home once more.</p>
