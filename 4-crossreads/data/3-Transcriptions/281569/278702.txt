<p>Same old routine, our lines again increased by four, viz anti-aircraft, R.F.C &amp; ordance (&amp; lines to the artillery). Mustard &amp; I have got our leave at last &amp; are off in the morning.</p>
<p>Planes been rather busy of late &amp; they report that the Hod's are being gradually manned either by Turks or Arabs who proberbly have come down for the date season.</p>
<p>British are still pushing on in France &amp; doing well although the weather is against heavy operations for rains&amp; have made many of the roads impassable  .</p>
<p>Faroe sent away today with an impassable throat or sceptic &amp; is now under observation for diphtheria.</p>

<p>16 July, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>Up at 5</p>
<p>Set sail for Pt Said at 0530 &amp; caught the train OK arriving at Kantara about 0700 where we had to wait until 1130 before we got a return. Got into Pt Said at 1 &amp; first of all looked for sleeping quarters &amp; were fixed up at Hotel de-la-poste where we started off with an excellent feed then went for a stroll, the city is very clean &amp; very modern although the Italians are in the majority as usual, music is to be heard at every resturant. We spent nearly all our time in eating houses &amp; [indecipherable] cafes, after tea hired a garry &amp; went to the seashore where hundreds were bathing, drove all round &amp; finished up with two melons for supper, retired full &amp; tired.</p>
