<p>Sunday 9th January.<br/>Impressive Church service. I believe the Dardanelles are evacuated &amp; all the Australian troops which are withdrawn are camped about 16 miles from us, I may meet some of my friends.</p>
<p>Monday 10th Jan.<br/>Visited the engineers who have just arrived from Sydney. Met a number of my friends including a few of my pals from Neutral Bay, Jack Reid, from Oaks Avenue, Bob MacDonald from Grosvenor St. &amp; Jack Kernigan. The engineers brought a piano with them all the way from Australia, it is a real treat to hear some music again, the long evenings will be far more enjoyable now.</p>
<p>Tuesday 11th Jan.<br/>Monotony broken a little to day, had our first training in digging trenches &amp; dugouts, very good exercise as a matter of fact the officers do not really know hat to do with the men.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12th Jan to Monday 17th Jan.<br/>Same routine drill &amp; digging trenches etc.</p>
