<p>14 September &nbsp;1918</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>Its Saturday evening - time about half past nine and I&#39;m on the phone sitting in a bell tent which was camouflaged with bamboos and other green stuff a couple of days ago, <s>and</s>&nbsp;its just beginning to dry and the smell of it carries me back to the Cooyal lucerne flats, and I remember the evenings you and Father and I have driven past there with Joe in the old sulky and smelt the new own hay, on our way home after a day in Mudgee.<s> And</s> Now you tare past there in a car and I&#39;ll bet you go so fast you hardly see those flats - let alone smell them. But I guess the car will do me and I wont stop to smell smells or be poetical once I get going.</p>
