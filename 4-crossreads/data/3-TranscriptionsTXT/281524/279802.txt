22/9/17 Westhoeka fellow named Day who did Pozieries  Bullecourt and all other stunts came in with a fit of funk. "It is awful all my mates are killed or wounded I can't stand it &&" so sent him back to the Transport Lines. Preliminary orders arrived for me to extend my frontage to double what it is now by taking over more on the left and there is talk of the whole Division moving out tomorrow. Shifted quarters to a pillbox in front - the Germans are filthy and our men shovelled out loads of muck that stank. Colonel Brazenor came in during the morning. Overhead the Taubes were very active and drew a lot of fire from our m.g.s. The conversation of the details who occupy the other half of this place is funny. "Gawd" says one "our b--- 18 pounders whistle like --- galahs." The 23rd. caught a fat German sergt. major, yesterday, who had got lost.
