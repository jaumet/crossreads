<p>Thurs. 10" Aug (7 a.m.)<br/>It is wonderful how quickly the days go by &ndash; there is so much to do every day &amp; time never gets a chance to hang on ones hands. From 6.15 a.m. to 10.30 or 11p.m. there always seems to be something to do including, when I can manage to get it in French &amp; swimming which are at present my only forms of recreation. The French can hardly be called amusement &ndash; it is too solid. I have been keeping it up steadily for 7 months &amp; hope to be pretty proficient in another 5. The weather is at present fine &amp; the swimming good although the Channel is pretty cool.<br/>A couple of days ago King George came across to France &amp; his ship was escorted by 6 destroyers 2 submarines &amp; two airships making I believe, a jolly fine sight. I did not see it as there is</p>
