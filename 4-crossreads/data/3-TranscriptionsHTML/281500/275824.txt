<p>some one else said "stand by your packs", and etc, this is how a chap is generally greeted when he comes into someoneselse's hut, but the funny part of it was that the Dr was just behind Charlie coming in to have a look at my sick men, everyone grinned when the Dr said, "whats the matter" for he heard our remarks Ill bet he laughed when he got out. <br/>A lot of the officers are making it a welter on the whisky lately, if I had my way I'd straighten these jokers up I'll guarantee, I have no time for a drunken officer and I have told a few of them so, a lot of people think an officer is just IT but in a lot of cases they are sadly mistaken for some of them are wasters and I should be sorry to see any sister or lady friend of mine walking</p>
