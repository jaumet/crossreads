<p>away so we had a chat to McKeown &amp; a few more &amp; then walked home <br/>19th.  This morning I was up for classification &amp; what a farce it is you all stand in a row &amp; they run you through like a mob of sheep.  I don't know what he marked me nor care much for I have no desire to stop in this Camp long, it rained like hell all the morning but this afternoon things look much brighter, just before dinner Len came over &amp; took me back to dinner with him to his Mess, he is Catering Sgt &amp; has the best Mess on the plains I was told this several times by various chaps &amp; its true alright for it is very nice &amp; the food judging by the dinner plentiful &amp; good &amp; everything is run on a system so there is no hitches</p>
