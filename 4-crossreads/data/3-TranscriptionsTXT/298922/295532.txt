 No. 10 Convalescent HOME. When photographing Price's grave yesterday I found Markham Robertson's &amp; send you a photo to give Mrs. R. I'm posting Mrs. Mills one of Vivians. 
 The Colonial Photo Store, 31 Ramleh Street, Alexandria will find any mans grave &amp; photograph it &amp; send it out to parents. It takes a long time finding the grave sometimes. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.] Went to MONTARA with a Brigadier [indecipherable], whose carbon copy of letter to son describing the place I enclose &ndash; as he has done it so well, he read me the letter &amp; I jokingly said that will do me, so I enclose COPY.
