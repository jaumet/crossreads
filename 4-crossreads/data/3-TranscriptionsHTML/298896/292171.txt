<p>news through of a great success in Palestine 18,000 prisoners.<br/>Tuesday 24thSept.<br/> had yarn with Colonel, he had had a good holiday &amp; now intends to apply for Australia leave, he being a 1914 man. He told me that he had tried for a post in England for me as a spell &amp; that it would be arranged. In the afternoon went to collect drugs &amp; then on to Bray- Sur-Somme with some mail for our chaps on their way to Australia. There I had an exciting hour meeting old friends, Comrades of the old 1st. Field &amp; chaps I had not met since Lemnos Days. Several times I was hailed in the street &amp; all wanted to know why I was not of their number. It will be a glorious trip for them. Excellent news through of a big attack at Salonicka &amp; Palestine. On arrival home found orders out to get ready for the line so had a couple of hours work fixing things up, then the W.O. who was going on leave informed me that he had orders to hand over to me so that I will be acting Warrant Officer until he returns. This will mean heavy work if we go in the line</p>
