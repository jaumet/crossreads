  
 Monday 1 October 1917 1st Oct.  Daily routine the same.  We become more & more limp, all who can manage it are out in mufti - any sort - soft collars etc.  One more visit to Hold for blue bloomers, etc.  Then "Johnny Walker" in all his fancy attire.  (Wallace's coat & eye glass & stick, tall hat & swinging bottle.)  Rec'd "highly recommended". Waltzed a little, sang, talked & then to sleep.  9 sisters sleeping up on deck, myself not yet.  We gradually become acquainted & little friendships form which may last who knows for ages.
