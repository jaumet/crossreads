  
 night - we weren't delighted to hear it, as apart from the night stunt itself, it points to a hop over for us as soon as we go back in the line. After church parade General Birdwood presented military medals, D.C.Ms & M.Cs to men & officers who won them some time back. Then he gave us all a very fine address, a sort of farewell, as he is to leave the Australian Corps & go to an Army. However, he said the Commander in Chief had promised him the Australians would still be with him. He referred to the 31/2 years he had been with the boys in Egypt, Gallipoli & France, also he said the Australian soldiers had done more for the name of Australia than all the politicians since the days of Adam. We all then marched past old Birdie, he had on one of our turned up felt hats, & came back to Allonville. After dinner I played in a cricket match, D Coy. v. Bn. Headqrs. We went to one field, & some chaps were having a practice, then we were told the match would be in a field where the Bn. parade ground is, so we went there, but the 14th Bn. were playing there.
