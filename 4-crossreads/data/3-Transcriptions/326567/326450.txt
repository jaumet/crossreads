<p>Thursday 31/5/17<br/>After resting all day I went for a walk out past the Munition Works &amp; while I was passing the works the girls were coming out. It being 6.30 Pm the time they finish work for the day.There are a fairly large number of Women employed there, they dress strange. They all wear baggy overalls &amp; look like a lot of old Men from a distance. I noticed a few men here &amp; there. After continuing my walk along the Canal I came back through the Village to Camp &amp; took up my duties at 9 Pm. Everything was quiet until when the Siren again blew one blast, in a few minutes shells were exploding away to the North and Search lights were seen in several directions. The Shells were exploding up very high &amp; gradually worked around in a Westerly direction likewise the Search lights were playing up amongst the clouds looking for Fritz who evidently was somewhere about. The Siren sounded at 11.35 Pm &amp; the Shellls were bursting in the Air until after 1 am. No doubt it was a great sight, &amp; reminded me of a Fire Works display.</p>
