24-12-16Luden called on me today & told me that Bob was practically blown to pieces by a Shell on the Sunken Rd. near Flers.  He was taken to the dressing station & died there or on the way.  Luden wrote & told [indecipherable] Ciss that he died of wounds.  A most mercifull way of putting it.  Bob had fits on several occasions (4) & could have got out of it if he liked but wanted to leave with a few stripes. Some W.O. in the N.R. kept asking if he had got any.
