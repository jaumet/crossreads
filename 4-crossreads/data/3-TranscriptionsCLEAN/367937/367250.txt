  
 never seen rain and my balaclava cap has just gone on with my kit bag to the pack store near Cairo. There is a Y.M.C.A. in this camp but it some distance from here where we are camped and we have to pinch off there when we want to go as we are not supposed to leave the lines camp in case we have to the stand to the horses. Will you please thank Aunt Min for the fly net & the mirror and Aunt Katie for the pairs of socks. I wrote to Aunt Katie a few days ago. I wont be able to write to every body as I have been doing as the nights are so short we have to sleep in the day time and it seems hard to settle down & write letters out here so I'll try & write [indecipherable]  news. Ronald McDonald is camped close here but I have not seen him yet and Colin & Leycester are about a mile & a half away I think. Although I had to send my kitbag away I have still got a good bit of stuff with me, managed to stick it in my blankets on the quiet and so have got two spare frannels and socks etc and boracic acid vascelene soap.  That knife and falk affair you gave me is very handy.  Frank has nothing to grumble about being a W.O. it is a jolly nice job - expect he has gone straight to France - If you want to know what to send - anything eatable is good as long as they are not thirsty things - prunes, dates, cheese chocolate etc are all good things but butter scotch is a bit dry.  There are tons of date palms here but we never seem to get any dates.
