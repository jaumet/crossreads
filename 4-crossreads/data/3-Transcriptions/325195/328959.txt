<p>2.10.15<br/>Sat 2nd</p>
<p>This morning we received orders to shift our camp as we have been in A Sqds ground &amp; we had to move to make room for reinforcements that arrived last night, so we put the morning in making ourselves comfortable once more &amp; are now camped on a small terrace with a couple of reinforcement Officers, we are in a much better position than the last "bivy" &amp; are OK here; Hobson Randall &amp;Fox swam out to the beached sailing vessel to-day &amp; managed to force some slabs off the hatchway &amp; found one of the sails nearly new &amp; commandeered it for the Officers dugout also as much firewood as they could carry .Penny managed to secure 1 doz eggs at 1/6 at Anzac this afternoon so we are still right for rice custard.</p>
