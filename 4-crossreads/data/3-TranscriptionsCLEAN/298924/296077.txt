  
 Saturday 5 April 1919 I do hope Joe can meet Dolly in case I do go on to Sydney - if I do go Sydney will send Dolly's luggage by Permanent Weight & direct to D'quin & if Dolly does not wait but goes home with Joe, send a wire to C/- Wilkinson & Lavender, Sydney, then I would not go Melbourne. Love, Frank.
