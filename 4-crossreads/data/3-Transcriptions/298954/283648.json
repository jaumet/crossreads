<p>Wed.  22nd May (cont.)<br/>Leaving the Stettiner (a fine fa&ccedil;ade) we set off via various squares etc for the Potsdamer Bahnhof.   The vistas in the vicinity of the Pariser Platz were magnificent.   The Reichstaggebaude with it's gilded dome <strike>it seem</strike> did not impress me greatly;  it appeared to me that it is the glorious tree avenues and the monuments such as the Brandenburger Thor which have given Berlin it's reputation as a beautiful city.   The vista looking along "Unter den Linden" from the Brandenburger Thor is magnificent after such aesthetic horrors as most "Aussie" streets.</p>
<p>The Leifsiser Platz, opening into the Potsdamer Platz were very busy, the hotel terraces and the cafes being full of chattering feminity in new spring attire.</p>
<p>The German girl lacks, chic, but the fashions are still imitations of Paris.</p>
