and wounded four very badly. Saw a very touching parting to-day. A large number of Maltese are doing labouring work here. One of their number was going aboard the barge apparently being evacuated sick. His mates standing around one after the other shook hands, kissed one another on the cheeks, and tears were trickling down their cheeks. These Maltese, although they are only fifty yards from us, they are living in a "possie" which is being shelled regularly.

Dec 5th Sun.
Principally medical cases in the hospital at present. A tremendous bombardment is taking place midway between Suvla Bay and here. Heavy ammunition all simply being poured over on them. This happening only a mile and a half away we witnessed a magnificent spectacle. The shells come over one after another in rapid succession and the clouds of earth raised must be about fifty ft high. Learned afterwards that they had practically destroyed No 16 C.C.S. and some H.Qs. numerous soldiers have been killed and our staion is now full up having had to receive the patients who had managed to escape the bombardment of No 16 C.C.S. and no hospital ship is available to take them away.

Dec 7th Tues.

Still no Hospital Ship available.
