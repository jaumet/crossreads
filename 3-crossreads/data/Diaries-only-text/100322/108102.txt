Edinburgh ? London
Made Adieux and left Waverly Station at 10. Amusing to see the Station Master wearing a top hat. The run to London uneventful and pleasant. A good view of York Minster and the Peterborough Cathedral on the train. It is the ordered regularity of the fields etc here that constitutes the difference between our country this. In their paddocks there is no ?picking up" to be done. In Paddington at 7.25 after a tube run from Kings Cross. Got my hotel room and dashed off to catch a train for Hammersmith. Went to the Kings Theatre got a ticket dashed up the stairs and took my place just at the exact moment the curtain went up on a good rendering of ?Mignon". Bed midnight.
