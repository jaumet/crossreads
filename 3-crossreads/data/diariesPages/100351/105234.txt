Ch Parade by Canadian Minister v. Good. "Live a day at a time". He struck the right note at the right time. Leaning against a Pear tree in the orchard (he said, "he liked to be up against something when he talked") he talked in a charming manner to men face to face with the Great Unknown
Remainder of the day our own.
