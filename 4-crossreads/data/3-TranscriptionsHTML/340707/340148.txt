<p>To night I find a little caf&eacute; where one can dine conveniently well for 3 to 4 francs &amp; which several American officers have turned into a mess. I meet here [Maintor] a fine chap &amp; destined to be my sole companion.</p>
<p>13-6-19<br/>This day I have nothing to eat till dinner &amp; have a long yarn with Madam who runs the hotel. Louvre again this evening at 3.30 till 6.0 pm &amp; then [indecipherable] invites me to the concert organised by the Americans prior to their departure.</p>
<p>I spend all the morning in the garden de Luxemburg the prettiest gardens in this pretty city. The play of fountain &amp; walls of spray from the watering pipes under shaded walk among sculptures lends an enchantment to this fairy dell of green grass &amp; greener trees.</p>
<p>Alongside of me is a musical student who is huming Il Balen &amp; on the other side a would be artist who is spending his time feeding the sparrows with morsels of bread which he has specially brought hither for the purpose</p>
<p>14-6-19 Sat<br/>Rose in time to go to concert which is really excellent A W Browning an American</p>
