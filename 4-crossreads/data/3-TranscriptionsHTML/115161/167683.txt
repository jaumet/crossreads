<p>Gorgeous flower gardens, and surrounded by huge parks.&nbsp; One can imagine the sport obtainable in a place like this.&nbsp; Boar hunting is a recognises [recognised?] pastime.</p>
<p>While here a new boss arrives, and at once becomes a general favorite.&nbsp; It would not be possible to find two men so different in every way.</p>
<p>This man was a gentleman and he and I became as friendly as it was possible for a Staff Major and a Lance Corporal to be.</p>
<p>I have to thank him for many good times in France and Belgium.</p>
<p>His wife was <s>for some time</s> in Paris and she spent much time with me on my first visit there -showing me round -.&nbsp; Like her husband she was a real good sort - no swank or humbug -.</p>
<p>We move on from here by lorries to a place where we understand we are to remain for two or three months, as it apparently is at last recognised by the authorities that the Division needs a long rest.</p>
<p>We remain for one night at a small village, and arrive the following afternoon at</p>
<p><u>GAMACHES</u>.</p>
<p>Here we are quite away from all idea of war.&nbsp; Everything seems absolutely peaceful and quiet, we are fixed up in comfortable and clean billets, and we all settle down to have a good time and try and forget the war for a time at least.&nbsp; Everyone is happy knowing that we are really out for a long rest.</p>
<p>A very nice town where one can procure almost everything.&nbsp; Shops and stores, good and clean.&nbsp; People of a very different class from those we have met with before.&nbsp; It is the first time that Australians have been billetted here, and the popula<s>n</s>ce welcome us and treat us well, and their hospitality is not abused.</p>
<p>There is not much work to do.&nbsp; The troops are given more latitude, and so long as they do not overstep the mark, no action is taken against them.&nbsp; Entertainments are provided and taking all things into consideration we have a jolly good time.</p>
