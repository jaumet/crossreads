 we do not get much news here as the the paper only prints the German's fights I had another letter from Aunt Florrie She writes me nice letters. I have sent one letter to her and am sending another by this mail. She told me to be sure &amp; come to her place if I go to England. I don't think there is any chance of that yet a while. We have no idea when we will go. It will not be for a month yet. We have a lot of training to do yet. Give my love to Jess &amp; Marguerette &amp; Jack also all the Friends Kindly remember me to them &amp; tell them we are in great heart hoping you are all very well &amp; enjoying the best of health. With all my love &amp; kisses Your loving Son Tom
