<p>Cairo, 18/6/15</p>
<p>We are now revelling in a beautiful cool change.  Yesterday Will took Margaret &amp; me down to the Barrage on the Nile Delta.  It is a wonderful place.  We went by train &amp; then for some miles on a trolley hand pushed by two perspiring natives.  Left here at 3.30 &amp; got back at 7.15.  Best love to you both from all of us, always yours<br/>Rene</p>
