<p>questions the soldiers put to them are none too easy but they manage to direct them all.<br/>For instance I met two friends of mine roaming around looking for their boarding house. They had forgotten the name of the house and of the street in which it stood but had a slight idea of the neighbourhood in which it was situated.  I trotted them off to the nearest policeman and as I anticipated he solved the difficulty. He named several boarding houses round about and my friends recognised theirs.<br/>Other unique characteristics of London are the Motor-buses - which quite supercede trams and run everywhere - and the tube railways. Half London is said to be travelling underground at all times. I think I exhausted these subjects in my previous letters.</p>
<p>To come back to home - what a nuisance - Tommy workmen have been renovating our hut for the past few days. We had to turn everything upside down to suit their convenience whilst they recovered the walls up to five feet from the floor with galvanised iron and painted it. I couldn't find a clear space to sit down at to finish this letter and as a consequence it is now the 10th (Friday). We have had six patients quartered in our hut too during this week and they require a good deal of attention. Bronchitis is very prevalent in the camp just now and three of our five detail are suffering from it.<br/>Well I daresay it will be very nigh Xmas when you</p>
