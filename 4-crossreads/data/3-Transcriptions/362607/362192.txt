<p>Dear Mum,<br/>This is the Church Yard in which the Village Blacksmith  &amp;  his family are buried, The green lies near the Path on the other side of the Bushes near the Porch. In this porch lie the two stone images which were  dug up near Milstone, relics of times before Saxons were in England. The Village Smithy lives right opposite.   Harry.</p>
