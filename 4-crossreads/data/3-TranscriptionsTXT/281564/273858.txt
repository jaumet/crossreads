 Monday 7th September 7 AM Landing party No 5 company Marines left for  Fly River to guard wireless station 7.45 We left port &amp; by 8.30 were well outside the reef. During the morning we received a lecture on "what to do in the tropics" We are not to wash in the morning  but at night, &amp; then in hot water. Mosquito nets are to be supplied &amp; camps burnt off to drive off the insects. 
 12.30 do &ndash; more oblivion. During the morning the Queensland troopship "Kanowna" returned for some unaccountable reason to Townsville. Some say &ndash; probably the bloodthirsty element that her firemen struck.  Li'ghts out.
