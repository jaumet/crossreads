good time.Thank Ralph for his kind letter of congratulation to me, I will write him some of these days. Also dear little Beres I treasure all her nice little letters, although I havn't answered one yet. I am glad R is feeling better & wish him the best of luck in his final.Did I tell you I got my second star? I am so careless in these things I forget to tell you lots of things I should.I will see if I can get hold of the "Anzac Book" for you I had one & lost it they should have some in our office here.Thank you very much dear for your forethought in making me winter stuff, I hope I pull through this affair & get back home & repay you for your kindness to me since I have been away your letters are always cheery & newsy & you cannot imagine how I relish
