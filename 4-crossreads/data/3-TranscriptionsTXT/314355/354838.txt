June 12199.At 9 this morning an officer and 4 O.R. of the 4th attempted to raid an enemy post.  The post was manned by 20-30 of the enemy who shewed fight.  Our party succeeded in killing several - but then had to rapidly retire, followed up by heavy M.G. rifle and bomb fire.  Two of the enemy were brought back, but owing to volume of the incoming fire they were both killed in 'No Mans Land'.
