London
F. Dickens K.C. try Curzon Lawson on a charge of financial conspiracy. Back via Trafalgar Square to the R.A.C in Pall Mall to read the evening papers. Noticed little girls dressed in pages clothes calling taxis c. For dinner to the Cheshire Cheese in Fleet Street and had a good dinner. This old quaint place is my favourite resort for dinner but you have to pay for its oddness. Took a ?bus down to Trafalgar Sq which seems to be a concentration point for all the stray Tabbies Anzacs and others about. It keeps dark light until well after 10.30 and remained so until long after. I had packed up for my trip tomorrow and had changed back into uniform. An aeroplane flying over the city seems to attract a lot of attention.
