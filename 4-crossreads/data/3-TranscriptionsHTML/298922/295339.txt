<p>Hear a mail is in. Still getting a few Turksby our Patrols. Had the Turksused Barb wire at Maghdabad Rafa we would not have done so well. [The following sentence crossed through.] We are not amused BOSH on my neck &ndash; fancy as soon as a man gets on the Desert these things start.</p>
<p>I have been given a good book found at Maghaba &ndash; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Mantle by John Buchanan [Buchan]. You should try &amp; get it.</p>
<p>Tried to sleep on a Turkish Officers Stretcher last night but found I did better on the sand. Some of the Turkshave Medals that were given them for their Desert March to Romani!!! in Aug. these things will <u>sell</u> for 20/-.</p>
