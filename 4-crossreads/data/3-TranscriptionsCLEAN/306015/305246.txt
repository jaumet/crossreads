  
 on to motor lorries & from these transferred them to railway trucks about half a mile away.   This railway is on a miniature scale with a very small guage & tiny loco's and it runs right through the village at which we are camped and makes the place look a little bit civilised. 
 To-day I was on the earlier shift & our job was to salvage angle-iron and 'corkscrews'. 
 After work Alan & I  found  a small truck & put it on the rails & five of us set out for the Pozieres canteen.   About 3 miles away, pushing our truck uphill & riding it down.   We enjoyed the latter more than the former. 
 Coming home, we were flying down a steep hill at a terrific 'bat' when we caught sight of a petrol loco, coming in the opposite direction on our line.
