<p>To a false Patriot<br/>(By Sir Owen Seaman, in London "Punch"</p>
<p>He came, obedient to the call;<br/>He might have shirked like half his mates,<br/>Who, while their comrades fight and fall,<br/>Still go to swell the football gates.</p>
<p>And you, a patriot in your prime,<br/>You waved a flag above his head,<br/>And hoped he'd have a high old time,<br/>And slapped him on the back and said:</p>
<p>"You'll show 'em what we British are!<br/>Give us your hand, old pal, to shake:"<br/>And took him round from bar to bar-<br/>And made him drunk &ndash; for England's sake.</p>
<p>That's how you helped him. Yesterday,<br/>Clear-eyed and earnest, keen and hard,<br/>He held himself the soldier's way &ndash;<br/>And now they got him under guard.</p>
<p>That doesn't hurt you; you're all right;<br/>Your easy conscience takes no blame;<br/>But he, poor boy, with morning's light,<br/>He eats his heart out, sick with shame.</p>
<p>What's that to you? You understand<br/>Nothing of all his bitter pain;<br/>You have no regiment to brand;<br/>You have no uniform to stain.</p>
<p>No vow of service to abuse,<br/>No pledge to King and country due;<br/>But he had something dear to lose,<br/>And he has lost it &ndash; thanks to you.</p>
