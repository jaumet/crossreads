<p>Our horses are a bit shin sore coming off the Sandy Desert into this good country &ndash; they are all very good walkers now - &amp; got good grazing on the crops of Bearded Wheat &amp; Barley &ndash; but Water is still scarce. <strike>JOE 4/3/17. Letters from Mother &amp; Daisy &amp; May 27/2/17. Papers from Dolly &amp; a Cake from Laura. All very acceptable.</strike> - on our arrival back into Camp after 24 hours on Outpost.</p>
<p>Every day we can watch our anti aircraft shells bursting among enemy planes &ndash; not much success tho'. <strike>Day's letter had large cutting of D'quin Paper</strike>.</p>
