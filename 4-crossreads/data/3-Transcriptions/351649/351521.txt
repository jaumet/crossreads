<p>My dear Katherine</p>
<p>Many happy more Xmas's and New Years to you all at Burrabogie.  I just heard you had some good rains during October and that all is well, which is good.</p>
<p>How is little Tom???  Answer me at once, have his legs got any fatter or not.</p>
<p>There is very little doing on this side of the world except war:  everyone is fighting, and indeed I feel quite out of it in plain clothes:  there is a keen demand for decent men for officers and I am much exercised as to whether I should not chuck up the rotten medical profession:  in order to brush up my work, I am doing one of the jobs at the Hospital:  what a filthy business it is and what drudgery &amp; no chance of ever getting a smack at the German hogs.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of Colonials in London and one meets them everywhere, both women and men:  I shall get very stout if not careful eating such huge dinners and smoking fat cigars.</p>
<p>Address any letters you feel disposed to write me to C/o Dalgety, 45 Bishopsgate St., London, E.C.</p>
