Harry told me in his letter that he had left G. and was now a first class Sig. I hope he will get a decent job out of it, I fancy he will, and will I think, and hope be fairly safe. he also sent along one of Mothers letters that he had just received for me to read. I think I told Mother in my last letter that I had a letter from Bea some time ago. and a couple of weeks ago received a pair of Sox from her. Now there is very little else that I can tell you. hope that you have quite recovered from your illness and that you are able to help mother again. Must close now with love to all heaps for yourself and Mother from Chas.
My Love to all the Goonigal folk when you see them again. C.
