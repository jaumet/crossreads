 Melbourne, I have been a Charge-Sister at Caulfield Military Hospital, now Repatriation. On account of my Mother's bad health, I am obliged to try and obtain a position that will allow me to sleep at home. Enclosed, please find copies of four testimonials &ndash; Sorry I have not any since my service with the Military but shall forward some as soon as possible.
