New Kosciusko HotelThe day after King's birthday(I think one is allowed to state the date)Gallipoli Peninsula -
We are now up on our Hill again - quite like old times - very few casualties getting up. The Turkish fire is not nearly as thick as it was when we were up here before, but the accuracy is as of old.
Am sorry I cld. not write a letter last half weekly mail that went out but was busy unexpectedly & had just time to elaborate a card - Do not know how you get these letters I have written - In a heap?
Capt Smith the Regt Censor had some luck last week - He filled his haversack with censored letters & climbed down to post them at Section Hdqtrs - about 500 letters or cards - On undoing them there, a bullet had passed through about 3/4 & so I suppose a round hole was left in most of the letters - - - - -
Rather difficult to write: 400 ft below us - almost straight down - we see the road with men skipping across - very lively - Snipers (Turkish) are on this with great precision every day: we just had one lightly hit - on quartermaster's fatigue carrying food.
Had a rum ration
