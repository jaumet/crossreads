JULY   FRIDAY 21   1916
A beautiful warm day. About 70 of the Battery went on leave. The leave is badly managed as you only get four days including traveling to & from camp & it does not matter where you are going you have to go up to London first. I was an incinerator man for the day it is a good job. Got a cable from Linda to say all well.
