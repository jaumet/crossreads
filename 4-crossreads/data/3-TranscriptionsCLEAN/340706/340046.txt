  
 92 late. There are many guests & old mess is very bright & full of hilarity. After dinner drinks go the rounds & all is merry Young is dancing fling & Johnston sing [indecipherable] Hamilton is improvising Isaackson has been lucky enough to. Orgie continues far into the night & we finally go to bed about 2 am very early for us. 
 5-4-19 (Sat) This will be the last night that I will have a free leg in this town as I am booked for Opera to morrow night & on Monday I leave for Paris. Richards will go round with me & I am to meet him at Club. 
 In afternoon I meet Germaine & we go to Bon Secours & walk along the lands & orchards of Cote de Ste Catherine & then return to town where I leave here in Rue Jeanne d'Arc near Palais de Justice after putting her on the tram (No 12) 
 Then to dinner & then Brasserie de l'Opera where I lose Richards & almost decide to go home. However I strike a NZ Captain in street staring idly at a building but really waiting for some one to come out & meet him. I take a walk towards his home & then we decide to go the rounds for the night - 
 We go to Paris Hotel & meet Cameron & a New Foundland officers. We then visited Stephanis, Hill 60, Charleys Bar - now overflowing with civilians
