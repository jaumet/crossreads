<p>24 February, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>We got orders to be ready to move off at 9.0 to night &amp; all day we have been getting fixed up. Several of the boys are tanked &amp; some were betting odds that some would be left<br/>behind. Later we got word that we are not to leave until 12.00  Guess we will be tired out to morrow when we get to our destination. Serapeum is the name of the place we are going to</p>
