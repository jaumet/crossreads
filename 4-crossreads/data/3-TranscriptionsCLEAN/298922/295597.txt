Saturday 13th October 1917
Arrived Southhampton tonight!!!  We did not arrive land too rough & had to put back & tranship from the "Queen Alexandria" to the "Antrim" a bigger boat - all night we were buffeted about, the Channel very rough. We make another attempt tonight. No Cabins last night & no tucker, but I have a cabin tonight & am on shore at Cherbourg now, sitting down to a good dinner. It's a big undertaking travelling in wartime.
