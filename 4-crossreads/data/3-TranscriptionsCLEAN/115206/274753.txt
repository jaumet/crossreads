 Vaux sur Somme.1st Bty Posit. Weather glorious, wwarm with a very gentle breeze. Ken and I prepared our little whiz Bang proof home, - not of very much value. Tom Code volunteers to hop the bags with the F.O.O. on the morning of the stunt. Registration etc. the duties of the day. Slept very cold last night. Pas bon. Received a letter from Mother and Adrienne. Looking forward to shoot which commences tomorrow morning.
