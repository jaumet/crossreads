<p>a very thin time, but we are arranging reliefs of men etc for a few days at a time which eases the strain on them. We are firing on a average 1000 rounds a day per Battery and on the commencing day of the attack, my Battery alone fired just under 4000 rounds.</p>
<p>Arny Brown  is up in this vicinity &ndash; His Battalion went to the attack in the first wave and did very well. The same Arny is now a Major and has been awarded the Military Cross for his work on the Somme last year. He was up to see me today and stayed for several hours, his Battalion being out for a rest.</p>
<p>I have not seen Les for some weeks but hear he is OK. &ndash;</p>
