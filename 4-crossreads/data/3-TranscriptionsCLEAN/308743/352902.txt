Stables at 6The Instructional Staff took over their duties proper today and now we each have 3 n.c.o's & 18 men to instruct the class is starting from the very lowest thing and works up to the most technic points in the course, we have got our work cut out & can expect no help from the N.C.O's for they know nothing.  Mackworth is running a scheme tomorrow to see how much they do know.  The first mail arrived today and no pen can describe the feeling of the men discipline was forgotten for a few minutes but this is the mail dated December 6th I received 4 two from home one from Nell & one from Florie there is a lot of notes gone astray & I think that they must be in England & expect them to arrive any day.  I had the afternoon off and spent the night at camp work.  Bed at 9.00.
