30 March, 1916SerapeumLast night we bivouaced out in the desert, (the whole Regt) A & D troops were the "supports"  fortunately so the duty was not heavy,  Some of the other troops who went out on "out posts" got bushed  & they came back straggling in at all hours.  I heard that some of the Infantry have been on a bit of a march & they run out of water & some of the lad fell out & there were two or three deaths.  This morning when we got back it was red hot & we thought that we would not have to go out on parade however they took us out & we are having dinner now Under the oak trees on the bank of Suez Canal - I received a letter from Nanny Brown, Mum's cousin She said that there is a parcel coming - I hope it soon arrives
