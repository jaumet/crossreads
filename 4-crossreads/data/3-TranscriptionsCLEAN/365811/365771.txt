 Dear Judge, I am going like the dickens at present so you must excuse this short note. Its to tell you that the chocolate arrives regularly and is very much appreciated. 
 I am feeling quite fit but I must admit that the whizz of a shell becomes more distasteful to me each time I hear it. I  seem  am now a permanent sig. officer and it's a very good job too only of course the responsibility is at times pretty rotten. 
 Love to Mrs. Ferguson & Dorothy & clap K.A.F.on the back for me. 
 Yours sincerely J. Mant
