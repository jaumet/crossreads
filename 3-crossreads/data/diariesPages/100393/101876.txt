intervals of 50 yards between companies. After a certain distance we extended further with intervals of 20 paces between each platoon. When we got into the vicinity of Morcourt we extended even further with intervals of 10 paces between each platoon.Then we got up into front line supports here we were walking single file. No lights were shown no smoking was allowed.Our position for the remainder of that morning (we arrived about 1 A.M. after a long march heavily loaded) was spent in an old French trench, we had an old dug-out which served as shelter.A drink of cocoa an issue of rum were brought up and then we slept 'till morning about 7 A.M.22nd Aug.That day we did nothing except keep out of sight as much as possible. A hot meal was brought up during the day and that night another issue of rum came along, which was very acceptable indeed.Things were fairly quiet that day except that there was some shelling back where the cookers were, A few casualties were inflicted.That night in the dugout final instructions were given us so that we would know exactly what was doing. Maps and aireal photos were shown to us. After regarding those maps we knew the country we had to advance over and all prominent land marks. The time appointed for the attack was 5.15 A.M., about dawn. There was nothing to do now but wait.Some men got in a little sleep. Four of us played bridge smoked. Some sang. Others told yarns. From appearances a stranger, could it be possible for one to be there, th would not think that an attack was coming off in the morning, in a few hours.
