Dances. A few of the Girls were (although very nicely dressed) very real shrewdies in their Dancing style, made me think of Clontarf again.

17th, Saturday
Received letter from young Billy with views of Sydney.
When the 5th Division went over at Armentieres they were supported on the right by the 61st Div. The 61st had some Warwicks and Scotties attached to them. Some of the Scotties who were captured quarrelled continually with the 61st.
Tuesday, 21st
Time 3.00 A.M. We have been up all night singing. In view of the fact that we have handed in our Blankets and were to have our Breakfast at 2.00 A.M. it seemed hardly worth while but it is now 3 o'clock we have heard neither no Reveille nor has any Breakfast come to light. Hawker flew across the Atlantic yesterday 20/21st. (Later reports are to the effect that Hawker fell into the sea near the Irish Coast.) I nearly missed the Boat Roll today. We finally left Warminster Station after a sleepless night at 7.00 A.M. arrived at Liverpool at 3.30 P.M. We travelled via Bath, Cheltenham, Stratford, Birmingham, Bilston (very rough country here) Crewe. The Boat "Nestor" pulled out into the stream about 7.30 P.M. and left during the night.
21st, Wednesday
Left We passed Anglesey during the day.
22nd, Thursday
Rather squalmish yesterday today but have not missed any meals, by the way the tucker is very fair indeed
