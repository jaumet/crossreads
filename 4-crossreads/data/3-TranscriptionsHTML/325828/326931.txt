<p>the beastly Huns while we are at it.<br/>We are having good weather here now, &amp; the summer is coming on us week by week.  It will be a lovely sight here soon when harvesting is on I do wish I could whisk you all at home over here for a while to show you what France is like at this time of year.  At present it is crops everywhere sometimes oats, barley, rye, &amp; a lot of potatoes.<br/>A lot of places are worked entirely by the womenfolk, who do the harrowing, cultivating etc quite unassisted.<br/>On Saturday Wal &amp; I walked out to where Rid was billeted &amp; gave that gentleman quite a shock by our united appearance.  He &amp; Wal nearly embraced each other in their happiness at seeing each other &amp; had <strike>qut</strike> quite an old gossipy yarn over matters in general.<br/>I am keeping in splendid health &amp; strength &amp; sincerely trust that this finds you all well.<br/>Must close now, with love to all,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo</p>
