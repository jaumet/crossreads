<p>is a railway embankment not far away. Our boys have not gone back a yard here yet.<br/>5/5/17.<br/>Yesterday evening the enemy came over again and it was flaming hell for a while. I don't think he gained ground anywhere our machine guns cut him to pieces. The slaughter on both sides is sickening surely we will not be asked to hold this death trap much longer, the mob has lost heavily and the enemy is trying to cut us off; there are thousands of him but we have him well in hand as yet. The wound in my heel has been giving me fits, it has turned septic and is very sore.<br/>6/5/17. Came out a couple of miles last night with the remnant of "D" Company 20 officers and men. Went in about 200 odd strong. Reported my septic</p>
