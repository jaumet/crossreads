<p>Ryan only having his sword.  The first Turk he came to he was so excited that he forgot to use the sword, but grappled with the Turks throat &amp; left him for dead.  He then continued fighting for two days, when he was wounded &amp; taken on board the hospital ship Dongala, where he is now getting on well.  Some of the soldiers looking after supplies etc all day, get a rifle at night, without permission &amp; go sniping &amp; think its great fun.</p>
<p>One Division were in the trenches four days, having refused to be releived.  They said we have been waiting for this for nearly nine months now, &amp; we are going to have it while we have the chance.  Several have been killed in daring attempts to rescue wounded.</p>
<p>May 4th<br/>Last night was practically quiet, but at daylight this morning big shells started to fall all around the Transports, &amp; shrapnel burst over several.  We had 5 or 6 fall very close to us, so we decided to back out a bit.  All the Transports have been lying close inshore for over a week, now we have to shift further back, so I don't like the signs.  Perhaps that Aeroplane got our range yesterday.  It is a hard job to keep at writing because every few minutes something is happening.  Either a baloon is about to arise, an aeroplane is sighted, the Warships start banging away, or there is an artillery advance ashore or else shrapnel starts bursting among us, &amp; someone calls out, "here she is", "look at this one", "theres Lizzie again" or some such similar terms &amp; one just has to go &amp; have a look.  Already my work is a month behind, but I suppose one cannot watch a war &amp; work too.</p>
