  
 Monday 19 March 1917 [18 March 1918] Back to the same old round of no work & yet no chance of enjoying the rest as we "bed pat" all day long & the sister in charge is at the same mental strain all through. Concerts in the wards keep us from being too depressed & to see these long wards full of brave boys all in their blue coats unbleached calico shirts & red ties is very interesting to me & to study their faces a great pleasure.
