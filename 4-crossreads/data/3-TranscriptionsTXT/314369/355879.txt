After breakfast this morning I went for a bit of a stroll   &  heard from one of the medical officers that they were going to clear all the patients out to day.
About 4 pm we were all marched down to the Peir   &  put onto a trawler   &  she took us to the Hosp shipAbout 8 pm we had some beautiful Bread, Butter, jam   &  tea which was most welcome because we had nothing since 12 o'clock
