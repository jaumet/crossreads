  
 doors & skylights on the Station & Signal Boxes have been Smashed, there is very little doing there all the Traffic passes through to other parts, As the Passenger Train continued on to Colone I left it at Berguette & after a wait of about 1 hour I caught a Light Engine & returned to St Omer in time for Dinner. I must not forget to mention that all the way to Berguette the land is under cultivation the same as other parts & worked by somebody. 
 Wednesday & Thursday 10 & 11. I went the same way & came back on light Engines, on Thursday 11th the engine was a French one driven by a Frenchman & a very large Engine at that, having four steamchests & Cylinders. The Cab where the men work is very large & the parts are strong, being in different positions to our Engines, & the Fireman uses a lot of Water on the Coal & as it is very fine Coal he makes it into a paste & with a long handle shovel puts it into the Fire in lumps, & now & again in goes a Pricker & he draws it through the fire several times,
