<p>27<br/>try to record any new ones though often it may mean repetition.</p>
<p>This afternoon I decide to visit Parc de Montsouris &amp; commence to walk there. Day is hot &amp; I have had no meals I dont go very far when I decide to visit parc any day &amp; go up to top of Eiffel Tower 904 ft high an iron structure from where a most glorious panorama of the city can be obtained.</p>
<p>The people are no bigger than small points &amp; the houses have the same effect as from an aeroplane. Day is clear &amp; every suburb is plainly visible. Clamart with its dense wood &amp; Sacre Cour rising like a whitened [indecipherable] &ndash; a heathen symbol rising out of a godless city &ndash; The direction &amp; names of suburbs are marked above the glass 3rd platform is half glassed in but the 4th a few feet higher is exposed.</p>
<p><strike>Telegram &amp; PC</strike> can be despatched here but time does not allow me to send one. Paper thrown from top often wander a mile or so before dropping to earth or becoming lost to sight &amp; it is interesting to watch the childish play of expression whether of anxiety or delight that even adults take in this sport. Sunday ascents can be made for 2 fr weekdays 5 fr. Hence place is crowded on Sunday &amp; long queues wait at each platform for cages At one</p>
