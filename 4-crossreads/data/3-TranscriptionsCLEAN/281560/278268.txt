4/7/16.The daytime is quiet here except for the regular doses of "Hate" that we receive from Fritz at 7 A.M. and 5 P.M. or thereabouts. He threw a lot of heavy stuff over onto some place in the rear; he has succeeded in setting fire to something by conflagration I can see. During my shift last night I got onto "Parapet Joe's" emplacement; and kept firing at it till he got real mad and kept his gun firing on my bay for about five minutes. Have got my gear together for we are to be releived tonight. 5/7/16.The 45th reliveed us; their first time in the line, and the releif took some time. Marched through pouring rain to billets near Sailly-sur-Lys. The march was very fatiguing otherwise the releif was uneventful.
