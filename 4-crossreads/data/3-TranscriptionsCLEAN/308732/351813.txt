  
 Left Fovant Camp on 26.5.18 for France, left Denton Rly Stn at 9 P.M. arrived Folkestone at 3.30 A.M. and marched straight to billets in what had been before the war, a large apartment Hotel on Marine Parade, & fronting the Sea, these billets, as well as two other large hotels,  were  are surrounded by a high iron fence to keep the troops within bounds, and are only used for troops making a short stay on their way to & from France, The hotels look as though they would have been very nice to stay before the war, at present they are just stripped bare, and are pretty dirty with paper torn off the walls, and writing on walls etc. When we arrived here, we found a lot of New Zealanders & Tommies & Scotties also here, all going Overseas with us today. On the side nearest the sea, we are allowed to go down on to part of the "beach" as I suppose it is called here
