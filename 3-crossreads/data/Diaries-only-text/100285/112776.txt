Rather peculiar thing hanging up in one of the recreation rooms is a big picture, "harvesting at Colebrook, I have been trying to puzzle out whose place it can be but I can come to no settlement as yet, nor do I recognise any of the people shown in the photo.
2nd. Was marked out by the Dr. this morning they don't keep you here long, as soon as you can walk out you go, she's a nice place, but thank heaven I am feeling a lot better, but I could do with a weeks spell nicely
3rd. Fairly hot again today, nothing much doing, got a few letters a small parcel from Mr Duke
This is a very free easy place, no one stands to attention here when the Drs make their visits, just lay or sit on your bed while he questions you, they all smoke talk while he is
