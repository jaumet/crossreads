<p>A draft went to Joppa today but no orders for me &amp; I shall be content to do my 3 months in charge here. Dolly's Hospital will be within sight &amp; Ismalia where she will live is only 1 mile away. Note all your news, &amp; hope you got letters from England. Will look out for PARCELS mentioned. Went Ismalia for lunch &amp; interviewed British Red + &amp; arranged Flat for Dolly also saw C.O. of Hospital &amp; had a hot bath at the French Club.</p>
