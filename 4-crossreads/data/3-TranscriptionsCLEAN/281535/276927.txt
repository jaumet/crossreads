  
 23/4/19 Weisbaden in Chile and having lived in Germany all through the war had much of interest to tell & were inclined to the German view point. Our host proved to be ultra-hospitable and poured strong ten year old Rhine wine into us and then insisted in coming along and buying some Hockenheimer champagne for us in Wilhelmstrasse. He boldly announced that he was out for an orgie so Gorman and myself boldly cleared out to our rooms for a lie down before dinner. Dined and then went out to the Rhinegeld -  a dance hall where there many girls. All rather dowdy in dress and not made up at all. The "chicness" of the Parisienne is totally absent. Dancing & music here but all over by 10.
