Walked in Poperinghe through the rain & mud & reported at the station & obtained a movement order by which we obtained a concession at Calais when buying the ticket for Paris. A tip to the train chap gave us a good seat and the train left at 1.35 A.M. & reached Calais at 7 P.M. Here we had to change so left our bags with a Red Cap & had breakfast in the town. Then we wandered round the town rather a fine place & had a good view of market day, beach, splendid sands & pier etc, bought some fruit,had a shave & shampoo &bought postcards views of the place & then tram to the station catching the 12.30 train to Paris, tickets 6.20F each second class & reached Paris at 10 P.M. Before leaving Calais procured tickets for dinner on the train & entered the dining car at Boulogne there being no corridor getting off at Etaples, the train starting off again before we could get seated. This dinner was very good & very well served costing 6 1/2 Francs. Had an interesting conversation
