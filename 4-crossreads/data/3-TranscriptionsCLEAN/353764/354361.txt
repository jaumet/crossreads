It is remarkable how close their tears are.The ships alongside us, which are preparing to go through the Canal, are all getting rigged up with sandbags, so it certainly looks like trouble. The troops in Cairo & District are holding Sports & to see the various places is just like a hugh huge holiday crowd.

It is full moon here to-night & looks beautiful.  The Sun Sets at 5 pm & does not rise till 6 am.  So they are all short days. I am sorry to say the 1st death of the voyage took place to-day, the body being removed to the Shore. Lord Kitchener is at present in Cairo & is shaking things up considerably.To-night the Indian Transport, which has been laying near us & is crowded with troops, suddenly weighed anchor, turned round & steered back towards the Red Sea.  What it means I am unable to say.
