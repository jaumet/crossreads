<p>April 14<br/>Believe we are to resume the petrol tin stunt; in the meantime, today, we had more holiday, which however Fritz did not keep: the AA guns were in a constant state of agitation. As usual did a lot of exploration.  Marie Cappel lies on the side of the hill, - the highest land in this flat district, on which is Cassel.  Although it is only 156 metres at its highest, it is a very dominating eminence in the flat country.  We explored Cassel, a survival of an old walled town, whose Barons must have been able to bid defiance to the higher rulers of old before modern munitions were thought of.  There are survivals of the old walls; and a yearly carnival celebrates the survival of a tradition about giants who made their stronghold on the hill.  It is the most attractive town I have seen in France &amp;  I would like time &amp; money to spend there.</p>
<p>Marie Cappel has been turned into a concentration camp to gather up the men who have been scattered from their units during the recent demoralisation of the Tommy units.  I counted 28 different units in the camp to which our little Company's tents are attached.  Picquets go out searching the countryside, and as they meet stray soldiers order them to fall in.  They march in at night in parties that have become numerically strong.  Some of the men are without equipment, having jettisoned it in their anxiety to get away, or because they were weary of carrying it  Besides this men from rest camps etc are being poured</p>
