<p>1st July Monday.  Am Boarded by Dr or Col Maudsley and Sent to Weymouth to Monte Vidio Convalescent Home.  I was there 2 hour's and then sent to the Verne Citadel at Portland.  This Fort is a Revelation</p>
<p>2nd Tuesday.  am held for Inspection.  Dr Brook's say's I am a Passenger for Australia  That was Good News.  Our mates are catching it hard in France now But I would be of little use.  My foot is still Lame and I still use a stick  The Wound in my neck is still sore if I move quickly.  Have had a good look over the Fort to day &amp;  Watched Air ship's &amp; Seaplanes scouting around Portland Harbour.</p>
<p>3rd Wed.  Another Board.  Major Bell's this time  He is called the "Gutzer King"  He asked me my age I told him. He said is this Paper Correct, That is my Medical History, I replied I'd never seen it.  He said I suppose it is alright.  Dismiss.  He wrote something and called the next.</p>
<p>4th Thurs.  Had a day round Portland Easton and Fortune's Well.  Went over the Old Rufus Castle and paid &pound;1-0-0 to the Old Soldier who loook's after the Royal Apartment's in our Fort.  He showed me round all of it, it is all under -</p>
<p>4th Thurs  Continued.  - neath the whole Fort Parade Ground Etc. The Royal Apartments he said was used as a prison for a Queen of Portugal.  The Underground stores were Wonderful.  There was coal to last 7 years, also Condensed and Preserved provisions in the event of a siege.</p>
<p>5th Friday.  We were allowed (if the Dr permitted) week end From Friday at 6 to Monday Morning.  I was let go and the Dr said a glass of Stout would'nt hurt me, so I took the Blue Band's off.  I saw Pool from the train going to Weymouth, and I went there.  It is a lovely Place and it reminded me a great deal of Geelong.  I enjoyed my trip and remarkable to say I forgot about the stout.</p>
<p>6 &amp; 7 is all written together</p>
<p>8th Monday.  Had to report to the Dr  He said I'm alright if I go slow.  He laughed over me forgetting the stout.  Put in the day about Weymouth.  We saw some old History there and the Famous White Horse cut out on the side of the chalk Hill.  There are amusements here Galore &amp; the People are good to us.  I was taken to Wyke-Regis for Tea, Mr Tall is a Grand Old John Bull.</p>
