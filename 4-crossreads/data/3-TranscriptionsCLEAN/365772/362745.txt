  
 France 27.6.16 My dear Sister, As the mail for home closes to-day I am dropping you a line to let you know I am in the best of health & going strong, we are now doing another turn in the line, this time things are a lot more lively, a devil of a lot of artillery "strafing" by both sides, we have had the usual casualities & so far my luck remains good. I have quite settled down after my trip to London now, am looking forward to the time when I get there again, one thing about here if one gets knocked it means a trip to England & good treatment, not like Egypt, they give our wounded a fine time, there are so many women over there who are anxious to do something for the soldiers & their only way is in connection with Hospital work, so the "Tommy" is well catered for. Well my dear a lad is waiting to take this to the Field P.O. so will close with fondest love to self R & B. from Ken
