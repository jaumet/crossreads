<p>[30th Sept. contd]<br/>Wood.  Then we followed the railway up towards the front line and what a picnic we had following that railway.  Lumps of railway sleepers barbed wire etc sticking up every yard &amp; the whole riddled with big shell holes.  The Tommies had put a white tape down as a guide for night carrying.  At last we arrived at Rabbit Villa &ndash; a pill box designed to hold two men &amp; as there eight of us the remainder had had to shelter as well as they could.  This was to act as our relay post and we had to carry down the railway track to Lone Wood.</p>
<p>The day was fairly quiet from our point of view and we learnt afterwards that our boys couldn't get the wounded in from the shell holes as Fritz was sniping the stretcherbearers &ndash; wounding two of them.  As soon as darkness came though patients simply rolled in &amp; chances of a sleep dwindled.  And what a carry we had too.  Up &amp; down shell holes tripping over barbed wire or rails &amp; all the time Fritz shelling hell out of everywhere.  It was miraculous we got 10 yds without a scratch.  A N.Z. party were laying a cable quite near to us &amp; a plane sighting them, soon brought  hail of shrapnel &amp; H.E.<br/>Sgt Lees party were carrying to us for Railway Dump</p>
