Tuesday 6th Juneusual routine of drill, swim a loaf  . . . until 4 & then a lecture.  Had a rotten bilious attack so felt anything but happy.
Wednesday 7thAt drill in morning acted as a patient & received a very rough handling I pity the patients (real) now more than ever.  Pay day so am well set up.  Arrangements made for swimming carnival tomorrow & may have a cut at some of the events.  A raid made today on the mens kits several things being confiscated such as extra impedimenta they should not carry.
Thursday 8thHeld aquatic sports for the ambulance during the afternoon & had some good sport.  I entered into the 66 yds breast & back stat stroke & won being extended by a Victorian said to be a crack in that particular line.  My section came second in the relay race.  The old members of the 1st Field won 21 points out of the 25 so did very well considering how few they were.  More sports to follow both brigade & divisional
