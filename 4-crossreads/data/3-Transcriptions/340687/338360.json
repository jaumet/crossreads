<p>February, 1917. 1st in Lent. Quadragesima. Sunday 25<br/>Foggy in morning sunny late afternoon. Usual routine till 11. when Brigadier of 3rd Bde told us to go home as Fritz had retreated 2000 yds &amp; probably 18 miles eventually. Brigade moved up closer during day. One man of 9th told us patrols were over 4 lines of trenches towards Bapaume. He shelled obviously from that way at long range. Home at 12 and had a good bath. Altercation with Dave in morning and S.M. told me to go pipe pushing to-morrow at 9.30 for 3 days school. Welcome change. Feeling rather unwell with diarrhoea. Infantry moving up closer.</p>
