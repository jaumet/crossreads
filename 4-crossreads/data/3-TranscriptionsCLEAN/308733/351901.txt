  
 on board, and came on by train leaving Alexandria about 3 in the afternoon so had two hours to look at the country-side, very beautiful, the little plots nearly all lovely green with different crops. Plenty of oranges & with a splendid flavor to be had at every stop. Both Divisions are in camp here. Got a letter from you with a pile more so must get down to answering them. This is almost on the site of the historic battle-ground and they say there is a possibility of another scrap here. Must stop 
 Best wishes from Don
