our attention. She was right low down right over our heads, we took no notice of her for we thought she was one of ours, but all of a sudden there was a rattle of machine gun fire from the sky, this made us look up hang me if it wasn't a Taube never saw such a bit of cheek in my life before she emptied her belts into something or other then started to make off, we could easily see her for she glided like a great black bird amp made straight for her own lines thinking to get back safely but her luck was out for our chaps who must have been asleep to let her come over, suddenly opened with their anti-aircraft guns they soon got the range we watched the shots getting closer closer amp at last down she come a beautiful buster, our gunners made good shooting alright.
