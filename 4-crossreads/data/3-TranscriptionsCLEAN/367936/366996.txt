Asphalt road all the way beautiful trees.  Arrived Menah [Mena] house;  got camels & donkeys rode round Pyramids.  Went into Temple of Sphinx;  all been excivated.  Granite stone, biggest 16 x 8 x 8, Alabaster floor.  See light of candle through stone.  Roman wall, Sphinx nose knocked off by Napoleon.  Went into big Pyramid, marble passages very slippery.  Went into King's chamber, centre of Pyramid well ventilated.  Marvelous echo.  Lovely spin back, got some cakes at Gooddies, back 6-30.
