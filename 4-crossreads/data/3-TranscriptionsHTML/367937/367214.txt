<p>12th July 1916</p>
<p>My dear Aunt Katie<br/>Will you please tell the boys that on the 10th July I sent I sent them a registered packet containing some photos, films coins &amp; stones - the coins are (1) An old Roman coin (most likely made in Germany) (2) copper &frac12; malime fairly rare (3) malime (4) 2 milemes  - The stones I picked up in the old trenches at Tel-el-Kebir and thought that Hal might like them to add to his collection.<br/>I suppose you have seen all the photos and views I have sent home: they will give you a better idea of the places I have seen than any description of mine would.<br/>Yesterday I went to the museam and spent an afternoon there amongst the mummies and old stones and inscriptions etc. but I cant say it interrested me very greatly as all none of the speciments had names to them, only numbers and a catalogue cost 11 pts and was in French at that.</p>
