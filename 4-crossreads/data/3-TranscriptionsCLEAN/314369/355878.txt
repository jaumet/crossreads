 Last night all the patients who were able to get about w/out assistance were installed in a large camp of bell tents (about 10 in a tent) which for men in all stages of mutilation is not good business. For breakfast we were treated to a boiled egg   &  piece of dry bread   &  a    dixie   mess tin of tea which we drank   &  had filled about 3 times (a mouthful each) stew for dinner   &  Bread   &  marmalade for tea Some talk of removing us to night but it looks too rough

 We had a variation in diet this morning, Boiled Bacon   &  Bread. Bully Beef for dinner   &  Boiled Egg for tea so we did not do so bad. One good thing we can get plenty of grapes here as well as chocolate etc. Went for a   stroll    to Y.M.C.A. tent to get some paper   &  write home A big batch go away to the Base to-day so may not be here long 
 The little bay is so full of shipping you could not get another fish into it.
