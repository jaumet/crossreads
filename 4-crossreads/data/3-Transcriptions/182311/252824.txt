<p>uncomfortably draughty, but with a little ingenuity made fairly comfortable. Other billets have been in the house of a doctor in the main street of the town; in the house where once had lived the Manager of the Brewery which housed our lads and in the attic of which I found some stamps to add to my collection; Oh, and there was another Chateau with the grandest of appointments, walls oak-panelled and with much ornate carving, and frescoes, too, which were extremely beautiful, there were four young subs. to occupy this place and we roamed the house and chose the smallest room, about twenty feet square, putting our valises lonely, one in each corner.&nbsp; This was once the H.Q. of a British Division, but when it was shelled the General left and the place became an officer&#39;s billet only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I&#39;m xxxx lliving in one of the drying rooms of a big laundry, it is a long low shed, the men occupy one end and the officers quarters and mess the other, six of us live together in rooms about two-thirds the size of my old bed-room.&nbsp; There is a low hessian partition between ourselves and our neighbours, and the nights are enlivened by the&nbsp; passage over the partition of weighty articles, raids from room to room, and the groaning of a dispirited phonograph.&nbsp; So far these homes have been far better than I expected to have on active service, and it will be fine if we never have worse.&nbsp; But best of all have been my friends, for a few warm hearts make the coldest billet cosy and really I have met - and meet constantly - the finest of men, merry men who with jest and laugh help to put a bright side on the worst</p>
