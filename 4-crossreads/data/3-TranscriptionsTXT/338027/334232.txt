 Saturday, 28 August, 1915 Rather busy day for us a lot of patients came down there are some machine guns &amp; a battery of Indian mountain guns near us and they have been playing havoc on the Turkish ridges so consequently the Turks tried to locate them with shrapnel and we got the lot all round us, but no one was hit.  We now learn that in the advance on Chocolate Hill two days ago we drove the enemy back &amp; captured three trenches but our casualties though not heavy were enough.  The L.H. are now out on the left flank having left Quinn's Post. 
 Sunday, 29 August, 1915 The German Taube flew over us again this morning &amp; dropped bombs three fell near headquarters but did non harm, this was followed by a lot of shrapnel all over the gully they are trying to locate the guns, the amount of shells fired by the Turks without doing any harm is enormous.  Our canteen stores arrived to-day &amp; were distributed each man receives so much &amp; it is put down in value in his pay book it consists mostly of luxuries such as tinned sausages, fresh fruit, chocolate, cigs &amp; tobac etc such things as are luxuries on the field needless to say at teatime we lived like lords but we paid dearly as four of us got Ptomaine poisoning I suffered during the night but felt better in the morning.
