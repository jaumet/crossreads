  
 Mon. Aug 6th. The weather was showery - smooth sea.   The "Wolf" did not linger long here, but set off at once in the direction of German New Guinea. 
 The "Matunga" has on board 20 passengers and a crew of 44, has 500 tons Westport naval coat & 900 tons general cargo.   All particulars were wirelessed from Sydney some time ago (in clair) to Rabaul;   the ship herself wirelessed at 6 pm last evening that she would arrive at Rabaul at 2 am. Tuesday morning.   She didn't arrive. 
 Tue.  14th Aug. Since the Matunga's: capture we have enjoyed the privilege of sleeping on deck under the awning.   It has been glorious in comparison with our abominable prison under deck.   We had little concerts each night after "lights out" at which Rees and "Thoraaaah" were prominent. 
 Had target practice one day - the "Matunga" towing & wooden target and "Wolf" using Morris tubes in her guns.
