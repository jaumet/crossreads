-2- 19th September 1916
The rats are here in millions.  Spending our spare time teaching them Company formations and how to form fours etc., but they are not too amenable to discipline, and they want a constant application of the stick to knock them into shape (or out of it).
Still in the best of health and spirits.
Love to all at home and kindest regards round about.
Your loving Son,Roy.
