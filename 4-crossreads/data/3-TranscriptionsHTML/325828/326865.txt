<p>too exhausted from cold to help themselves.  We got them into a warm bath put them to bed, &amp; they were able to go out the following morning.<br/>We have about 16 in hospital at present, but I am sure a lot of the men on board won't last long in Egypt.  We have on board about 1300 men comprising remount Units i.e. men that are going to Egypt to look after horses there.  These Units again are comprised of men from every state of Australia including Tasmania.  I have been struck by the age of the men on board here.  Among the 1200 men belonging to the Remounts only there are more men over 45 than under.  I was talking to one old chap who had 7 badges pinned on his tunic &amp; he was saying he was 64 years of age.  A tremendous lot are grey-headed.  I was saying there were 1200 out of 1300 belonging to Remounts the other 100 is made up of Artillery-men, AMC, &amp; A.S.C.  There are only the 24 of us AMC. men from New South Wales &amp; then 6 Staff-Sergeants from Melbourne are on board.  Then we have about 130 nurses on who are going as reinforcements to Nos. 1 &amp; 2 Aust. Genl. Hospitals.  The Chaplin on board is Revd.- Harris (C. of E.) who has just finished at Sydney University   A very nice man, &amp; is popular on board.<br/>The A.M.C have a mess room to themselves now, but only since we left Freemantle.  We have no special sleeping quarters but I generally camp on top deck astern.  Most of them swing their hammocks (Each man provided with a canvas hammock &amp; 2 blankets) but I tried it one night &amp; fell out twice whilst turning over in my sleep so now I just sleep on the deck</p>
