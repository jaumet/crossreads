not allowed to land.
We had been told that great preparations had been made to give us a good time so that we were keenly disappointed. All that we saw of the people of Australia was a few who came out on a small steam boat and cruised around the ship looking for some of their friends.
Many sharks are to be seen swimming around the ship. Some of the troops are trying to bait them with a lump of meat. Others have been successful in shooting some.
Cases of Cigarettes and Fruit have been sent aboard by people from the town. We can see the town away in the distance.

Since we left Fremantle yesterday the ship has rolled considerably. This has been the worst part of our voyage.
Huge birds are following in the rear of the ship.
