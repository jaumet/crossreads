21-12-16couple of hours sleep this morning & at 2 oclock shifted our position from a village we were camped by to the range of hills & ran telephone lines to each of the Squadrons & connected up with Bde. No one is allowed on the beach now. El Arish from where we are looks to be a lot of white building with the mosque with a high spire on it in the centre, running down to the beach is a large palm grove with several mud villages scattered about. The water is good.
