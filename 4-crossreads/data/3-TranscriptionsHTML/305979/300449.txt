<p>Our duties being over early in the day I found a nice 'posie' between our ceiling &amp; the next floor right against the port-hole &amp; there with Mrs.Brownings poems &amp; a packet of chocolates, &amp; the fresh breeze right off the sea which was just a few feet away, the world &amp; its troubles melted out of my memory &amp; the bliss of heaven entered only to be distubed when it was time to get dinner ready.</p>
<p>It is evening now, &amp; once more Allen &amp; I muse audibly to one another on our past experiences &amp; our ideals for the future, until the sun sets &amp; leaves the world to darkness &amp; to us; still we sit on till the stars shine out brightly , &amp; we think of all at home in Australia by</p>
