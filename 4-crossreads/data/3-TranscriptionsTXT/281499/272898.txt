 The 1st Pioneer Battalion have been working on the trench we are in for the last couple of day's it is the remains of an old German trench &amp; they are strengthening it in case of having to fall back on it. They put some big shells dangerously close to us this morning, one just seemed to miss my head &amp; landed a few yards off me throwing earth &amp; muck all over me, but still no damage done to life or limb Everything very active this morning guns, shells aeroplanes, balloons are everywhere to be seen &amp; you can hardly hear yourself talking.
