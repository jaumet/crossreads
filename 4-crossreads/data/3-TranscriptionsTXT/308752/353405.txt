 Arrived at -------- at 4 p.m. &amp; marched about 3 miles &amp; are billeted in an old factory at R------. After spending two days here we moved off on the 16th &amp; arrived at the Clearing Station at B------. The same spot where we were stationed last November, after having experienced that awful 3 weeks in the mud. It was still the same miserable hold, plenty of mud.
