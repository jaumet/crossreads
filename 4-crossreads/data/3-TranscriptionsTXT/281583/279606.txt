 19.8.16 Saturday 
 Last night was another Hell of a night and the Artillery Salvoeff from the 750 guns on our sector was terrible to listen to. The struggle has again opened up with redoubled fury and our objective this time is the famous fortress of Thiepval: whether it falls or not is an entirely different question, but if we can only take it, the terminating point of the whole German position will have been reached and the Germans will find themselves compelled to retreat. As is only natural the struggle is of a terrible nature and each step gained is paid for in blood. But the latest news available is to the effect that the Germans are being slowly pushed backwards. Evidence of the heroic nature of the struggle in progress is evinced from the fact that a column of 1500 un-wounded prisoners marched through today. They were all sorts and sizes and each one seemed to be mighty pleased that they were captured. 
 On our right the French are doing well and by a concerted action with our extreme right flank carried the key positions to the Towns of Maurepas and Baupume, It is at the last named place that the Germans have their big guns mounted and the loss of it to them will be serious. 
 They realise the fact that they are being forced out of their impregnable positions
