This flight is certainly one of the longest night opperations yet undertaken by aircraft in this war, and possibly constitutes a record 24/11/1915 Half an hours attack, from 7 till 7.30. Terrific rifle fire and bombing. Artillery fire very little. The Turks were repulsed with awful slaughter, They are hanging dead on their own barb wire entanglements. Today our Artillery are shelling their trenches at regular intervals. Their reply is feeble. The weather is mild again, although still cloudy. An alteration in horse exercise, beginning this afternoon from 3 to 4.15. Later. Exercise shelled, 4.7 percussion. Just got the ride into the lines in time. They shelled the exact spot that we were exercising on. Our luck was with us still. Not a man or horse touched. A man from 3rd Bty sentenced to 14 days C.B. and 14 days pay.
