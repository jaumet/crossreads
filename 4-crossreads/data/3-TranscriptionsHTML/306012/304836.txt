I have been <strike>just</strike> put on nights with a Cpl. &amp; 2 men.  Yesterday afternoon two of us went down to Locre where we ran the Div. Rest Station last time the Division was in the line.  We got a ride down on a motor lorry but walked the 6 kiloms. back along muddy roads.  It was a frosty day with a bitterly cold wind blowing.</p>
