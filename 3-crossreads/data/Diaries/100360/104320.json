Then we grabbed our Gear &amp; pushed our way to the R.T.O's office, where we were given Tickets stamped \"Detained at Etaples from May 31 till June 3.\" which were very useful to men who had overstayed their Leave.  We then went down to the Station &amp; got aboard the Train.  It did not leave till 9.30.  After an uneventful &amp; most dreary trip we arrived in Albert about 4.  One chap fell out of the Train &amp; got his Foot crushed.  I almost envied him.  We got a motor Lorry from Albert to Bapaume.  On our way back we met Sammy who informed me that I had been away the M.M. to which I said \"Hooray\"<br> \r\n [He was awarded the Military Medal]<br> \r\n Monday June 4th   Reveille at 6.  First Parade at 7.  We were excused the early morning Parade, &amp; also the others.  Break at 7.15.  The rest of the crowd went for a Route March with full marching order.  Snowy &amp; I stayed behind to fix up our things.  This is a very pretty Camp we are in.  Just the ruins of a number of Houses.  Some are in fair condition.  Our chaps spend quite a lot of time in the Garden, &amp; it is beginning to look very nice.  Outside the Tents they have made mottoes with bits of broken pitcher.  Some are very good indeed.  Billsy May returned from Hospital.  The wound in his back is not healed yet, but the silly beggar reckons he can't stay away from the mob.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300085\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 85]<br> \r\n Tuesday June 5.  Finished Letter to M.S.  Also wrote Stone, to Old Road.  Glorious weather.  Quite hot.  Went for Route March with Capt. Irving.  Tried to get to Picture Show at night with Snowy, Billsy &amp; Towny but after waiting around for about an hour they came out &amp; announced that the Show was off.  We went into what is left of Bapaume Church.  The Huns blew it up.  In one big vault there are a big number of skulls, which are said to be some of the Heads that were chopped off during the Revolution.</p> \r\n <p>Wed. June 6   Weather continues good.  Gas Helmet &amp; stretcher drill.  This afternoon our cricket team played the 3rd C.C.S &amp; beat them by 3 wickets.  We drove down to the Ground in Motors.  After Dinner I wrote to Ruth B &amp; Mother.</p> \r\n <p>Thur. June 7.  Squad Drill with Capt Irving.  It was very hot &amp; he kept us moving.  After Dinner went to Baths with Stan Wright.  Fritz put a few shells over at night.  Les Townshend went into Amiens &amp; returned in the early hours of the morning.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300086\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 86]<br> \r\n Fri.

There was a big crowd &amp; it was some time before we could get our Tickets.  The fare was \u00bd F.  The Train left Albert at 8.30 &amp; arrived in Amiens about 9.45.  There was a big crowd of our chaps in the City &amp; the shops did a thriving Business.  The first place I visited was a photographers.  I got my picture taken &amp; they promised to send them on in 3 weeks time.  20 Fs for a dozen.  Snowy Atherton, Nigger Bowden, Bluey Stanton &amp; Bricky Mason  were with me.  We visited the Cathedral &amp; spent some time viewing the wonderful carvings.  Most of the best work is covered by sandbags.  The weeping Angel is a very fine piece of work.  It is a copy of the original in Rheims Cathedral, which was destroyed.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300087\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 87]<br> \r\n Sun June 10 (cont.)   We had Dinner at a very nice place, where a girl works who Billsy May is always talking about.  Her name is Marie Louise.  We found out that while Billsy &amp; Sid Royall were there they helped M. L. to wash up, so we give ?em a [rib?] about it when we return.  After Dinner we strolled around the City &amp; made a few purchases.  I bought a little souvenir for Lill of the Weeping Angel.  After wandering around for a while we went for a ride in the Tram.  <br> \r\n In London the drivers are men &amp; the conductors girls, but in France the positions are reversed.  After the Tram ride we sat down in the Park for about an hour.  Then we had Tea.  Steak &amp; Eggs &amp; Bread &amp; Butter, &amp; cakes.  For this we had to pay 4 Fs each.  We went around the shops &amp; bought some P Cards, then we got back to the Station.  The Train left about 8 &amp; we got to Albert about 9.30.  We walked along the Bapaume Road &amp; waited for a Motor lorry.  One came along about 11.30 &amp; we were soon back in our Tent &amp; asleep, as it had been a very trying day.</p> \r\n <p>Mon.

Glorious old 26th,  2 years ago today was the happiest of my Life,  thanks to a certain little Girl saying \"yes\" to a certain question.  It is a glorious day. Just the same as it was 2 years ago.  I made up my mind as soon as I woke to try &amp; refrain from using any Bad Language all day - &amp; actually managed to do it.  Commenced writing my weekly epistle.  Got as far as page 6 before \"Lights out\".<br> \r\n After Tea we went down to the village to see the finals of the Brigade Boxing Tourney.  There were 4  3 - 2 min round Bouts &amp; most of ?em were either clever or funny.  One little officer caused a lot of amusement.  He was a good age, too, but only lasted 2 rounds.  There was a middle  weight match for 50 Francs which was quite exciting.  The 8 Brigade Band played at intervals &amp; Gen. Tivey was there.  It passed the night away very nicely.</p> \r\n <p>Wed. June 27th   Busy day getting ready for the Competition.  We had a go at Waggon loading today &amp; did very well.  Maj. Bond awarded D.S.O. which he richly deserves, as he did wonderful work at Bullecourt, the night Fritz put the Gas over.  Capt. Minty of the 15th got the M.C. which he certainly earned.</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300093\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 93]<br> \r\n Thur. June 28th  More stretcher drill &amp; Waggon Loading.  Breakfast was very young this morning.  At 2 p.m. there was a special Parade &amp; the Col. presented Maj. Bond with his D.S.O. ribbon, also presented ribbons to all who got the Military Medal.  I was one  of ?em.  That's another x  M.S. owes me.</p> \r\n <p>Fri. June 29  Same old [indecipherable].  Stretcher Drill.  For Dinner we had quite a good Feed.  Steak &amp; plenty of Beans &amp; Cabbage.  Posted Letter 23 to Lill  &amp; inclosed a piece of Ribbon.</p> \r\n <p>Sat. June 30th   Went to Henencourt &amp; had a \"try out\" over the Course.  The 14th &amp; 15th were also there.  On Sat.s. showing we stand a good chance of pulling off the prize.  Let's hope so, anyhow.  Went to Anzac Show.</p> \r\n <p>Sunday. July 1st   Glory Alleluia!  Out to Henencourt again.  No Church Parade.  A man will soon forget his prayers at this rate.  After Dinner I picked an eleven to play Miles Sheean's Team.  It was most amusing.  Alec Ewing made 30 runs &amp; Dad Good ? 50 ? quite a surprise   Miles &amp; I were both put out for a \"duck\".</p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300094\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 94]<br> \r\n Monday July 2.

July 4th  The great day arrived at last. Had Breakfast at 6.30.  Paraded at 8.30 fully dressed for the event.  Before we left Camp the Col. addressed us &amp; wished us \"Good Luck\".  He also pinned Shag's medal on, which was overlooked when the rest of us got ours.  We got out to the Ground about 9.45.  Rode out in the Motors.  Our first part of the Comp. started about 10.30  The 14th led off ? but had not got far with their drill when it came on to rain, so we had to take cover.  We had our turn next, &amp; the 15th last.  Our Waggon &amp; pair of Horses were easily the best on the Field; &amp; our Tent pitching squad had their Tent up in more than a minute quicker than the 14th or 15th </p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300095\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 95]<br> \r\n Wed. July 4 (Assault at Arms) cont)<br> \r\n Our First Aid Squad did very well, too,  If anything was at all doubtful it was our Stretcher drill.  [Barny?] gave the orders in an uncertain manner, which resulted in the movements being a bit ragged.  Every man was a trier, though.  It was a very interesting programme, &amp; the Anzacs showed up very well.  Birdwood &amp; a score of lesser lights were present.  Our Cooks brought out a Copper &amp; made us some Tea, so we had Dinner on the Grounds, &amp; made quite a picnic of it.</p> \r\n <p>Thur. July 5th  They gave us the day off, after about an Hour's Gas drill.  We played Cricket &amp; I did some washing.  A job I detest.  Received Pipe from Mac; who is at Weymouth.</p> \r\n <p>Friday. July 6th   Received Letter from Ruth.  Went for route march with Maj. Wooster through the villages of Hedauville &amp; Forceville.  We had a good spell in a deep forest, which was very cool.  On our way back we passed a big bunch of cavalry.  They went by at the trot, &amp; presented a very fine appearance.  Played Cricket after Dinner.

Hope to the Lord I'm back with M.S. long before another year is gone. </p>\n<p><a name=\"a5300092\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 92]<br><br />\n Tuesday June 26.  Glorious old 26th,  2 years ago today was the happiest of my Life,  thanks to a certain little Girl saying \"yes\" to a certain question.  It is a glorious day. Just the same as it was 2 years ago.  I made up my mind as soon as I woke to try &amp; refrain from using any Bad Language all day - &amp; actually managed to do it.  Commenced writing my weekly epistle.  Got as far as page 6 before \"Lights out\".<br><br />\n After Tea we went down to the village to see the finals of the Brigade Boxing Tourney.  There were 4  3 - 2 min round Bouts &amp; most of ?em were either clever or funny.  One little officer caused a lot of amusement.  He was a good age, too, but only lasted 2 rounds.  There was a middle  weight match for 50 Francs which was quite exciting.  The 8 Brigade Band played at intervals &amp; Gen. Tivey was there.  It passed the night away very nicely.</p>\n<p>Wed. June 27th   Busy day getting ready for the Competition.  We had a go at Waggon loading today &amp; did very well.  Maj. Bond awarded D.S.O. which he richly deserves, as he did wonderful work at Bullecourt, the night Fritz put the Gas over.  Capt. Minty of the 15th got the M.C. which he certainly earned.</p>\n<p><a name=\"a5300093\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 93]<br><br />\n Thur. June 28th  More stretcher drill &amp; Waggon Loading.  Breakfast was very young this morning.  At 2 p.m. there was a special Parade &amp; the Col. presented Maj. Bond with his D.S.O. ribbon, also presented ribbons to all who got the Military Medal.  I was one  of ?em.  That's another x  M.S. owes me.</p>\n<p>Fri. June 29  Same old [indecipherable].  Stretcher Drill.  For Dinner we had quite a good Feed.  Steak &amp; plenty of Beans &amp; Cabbage.  Posted Letter 23 to Lill  &amp; inclosed a piece of Ribbon.</p>\n<p>Sat. June 30th   Went to Henencourt &amp; had a \"try out\" over the Course.  The 14th &amp; 15th were also there.  On Sat.s. showing we stand a good chance of pulling off the prize.  Let's hope so, anyhow.  Went to Anzac Show.</p>\n<p>Sunday. July 1st   Glory Alleluia!  Out to Henencourt again.  No Church Parade.  A man will soon forget his prayers at this rate.  After Dinner I picked an eleven to play Miles Sheean's Team.  It was most amusing.  Alec Ewing made 30 runs &amp; Dad Good ? 50 ? quite a surprise   Miles &amp; I were both put out for a \"duck\".</p>\n<p><a name=\"a5300094\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 94]<br><br />\n Monday July 2.  Stretcher drill.  Getting pretty good now.  Received Parcel from Mac D. containing Pipe.   </p>\n<p>Tues. July 3.  Snowy Athertons Birthday (21)  Went out to Henencourt again &amp; put in the morning rehearsing for the stunt tomorrow.  Had afternoon off.  After Tea Smithy &amp; I went for stroll down the village.  Met \"Snowy\" &amp; Johnnie Maggs as we were returning.  They had been celebrating.</p>\n<p>Wed. July 4th  The great day arrived at last. Had Breakfast at 6.30.  Paraded at 8.30 fully dressed for the event.  Before we left Camp the Col. addressed us &amp; wished us \"Good Luck\".  He also pinned Shag's medal on, which was overlooked when the rest of us got ours.  We got out to the Ground about 9.45.  Rode out in the Motors.  Our first part of the Comp. started about 10.30  The 14th led off ? but had not got far with their drill when it came on to rain, so we had to take cover.  We had our turn next, &amp; the 15th last.  Our Waggon &amp; pair of Horses were easily the best on the Field; &amp; our Tent pitching squad had their Tent up in more than a minute quicker than the 14th or 15th </p>\n<p><a name=\"a5300095\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 95]<br><br />\n Wed. July 4 (Assault at Arms) cont)<br><br />\n Our First Aid Squad did very well, too,  If anything was at all doubtful it was our Stretcher drill.  [Barny?] gave the orders in an uncertain manner, which resulted in the movements being a bit ragged.  Every man was a trier, though.  It was a very interesting programme, &amp; the Anzacs showed up very well.  Birdwood &amp; a score of lesser lights were present.  Our Cooks brought out a Copper &amp; made us some Tea, so we had Dinner on the Grounds, &amp; made quite a picnic of it.</p>\n<p>Thur. July 5th  They gave us the day off, after about an Hour's Gas drill.  We played Cricket &amp; I did some washing.  A job I detest.  Received Pipe from Mac; who is at Weymouth.</p>\n<p>Friday. July 6th   Received Letter from Ruth.  Went for route march with Maj. Wooster through the villages of Hedauville &amp; Forceville.  We had a good spell in a deep forest, which was very cool.  On our way back we passed a big bunch of cavalry.  They went by at the trot, &amp; presented a very fine appearance.  Played Cricket after Dinner.  Commenced Letter 24 to Lill.</p>\n<p>"}]},"field_working_notes":[],"field_transcript_image":{"und":[{"fid":"105218","uid":"0","filename":"a5300015h.jpg","uri":"public://a5300015h.jpg","filemime":"image/jpeg","filesize":"1060996","status":"1","timestamp":"1389068103","type":"image","field_file_image_alt_text":[],"field_file_image_title_text":[],"metadata":{"height":920,"width":1400},"alt":"","title":"","display":"1","description":null}]},"field_diary_title":{"und":[{"value":"Arthur John Moore diary, 11 November 1916-11 January 1918","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"Arthur John Moore diary, 11 November 1916-11 January 1918"}]},"field_page_number":{"und":[{"value":"15"}]},"field_review_notes":[],"field_url_path":{"und":[{"value":"/page/104320/view"}]},"field_status":{"und":[{"value":"6"}]},"field_transcript_edits":[],"panelizer":{"page_manager":{"entity_type":"node","entity_id":"104320","revision_id":"104343","name":"node:transcript_page:default","no_blocks":"0","css_id":"","css":"","pipeline":"standard","contexts":[{"identifier":"User","keyword":"user","name":"user","type":"current","uid":"","id":1}],"relationships":[],"did":"0","view_mode":"page_manager","css_class":"","title_element":"H2","link_to_entity":"1","extra":[],"display":{"args":[],"content":{"73":{"pid":"73","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:transcription_document_ref","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"hidden","formatter":"node_reference_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"0","locks":[],"uuid":"9ccbf756-f2b4-4d57-bbfd-7c7fa38c5a8f"},"74":{"pid":"74","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:page_weight","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"hidden","formatter":"text_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"1","locks":[],"uuid":"d24dfe39-4671-47ec-be85-d537d02b50be"},"75":{"pid":"75","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:field_page_completed","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"above","formatter":"list_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"2","locks":[],"uuid":"f9c3ede0-b95f-493f-9535-0a7366ece5b1"},"76":{"pid":"76","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:field_transcription","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"above","formatter":"text_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"3","locks":[],"uuid":"b609cc6b-c87b-4692-9520-01c431aa0e77"},"77":{"pid":"77","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:field_working_notes","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"above","formatter":"text_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"4","locks":[],"uuid":"127fb571-c17b-4a8f-8e0c-00fa63bdc743"},"78":{"pid":"78","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"entity_field","subtype":"node:field_transcript_image","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"label":"above","formatter":"file_default","delta_limit":0,"delta_offset":"0","delta_reversed":false,"formatter_settings":[],"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":[],"extras":[],"position":"5","locks":[],"uuid":"ccd0c00a-13dc-4501-a91e-34e3d2b10f67"},"79":{"pid":"79","did":"13","panel":"center","type":"node_links","subtype":"node_links","shown":"1","access":[],"configuration":{"override_title":false,"override_title_text":"","build_mode":"page_manager","identifier":"","link":true,"context":"panelizer"},"cache":[],"style":[],"css":{"css_class":"link-wrapper"},"extras":[],"position":"6","locks":[],"uuid":"1ea8cc9d-43fc-484e-8bd9-467b53d82f4a"}},"panels":{"center":["73","74","75","76","77","78","79"]},"incoming_content":null,"css_id":null,"context":[],"did":"13","renderer":"standard","layout":"flexible","layout_settings":[],"panel_settings":[],"cache":[],"title":"%node:title","hide_title":"0","title_pane":"73","uuid":"8914f91c-b456-4f63-a7b8-22ba91035943"}}},"cid":"0","last_comment_timestamp":"1397715541","last_comment_name":null,"last_comment_uid":"1","comment_count":"0","name":"webadmin","picture":"0","data":"a:3:{s:7:\"contact\";i:1;s:7:\"overlay\";i:1;s:25:\"overlay_message_dismissed\";i:1;}","num_revisions":"1","current_revision_id":"104343","is_current":true,"is_pending":false,"revision_moderation":false,"path":"http://transcripts.sl.nsw.gov.au/content/arthur-john-moore-diary-11-november-1916-11-january-1918-page-15-1"}
