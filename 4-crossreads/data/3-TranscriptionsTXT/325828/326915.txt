Among it were 5 letters from you dated 27.2.16; 1.3.16, 5.3.16, 5.3.16, &amp; 6.3.16 also one from Mother dated 27.2.16.  Thank you both very much for your very welcome news.  I have also received a pair of sox that you sent out to me.  I have any quantity of these in hand just at present but they will all come in useful sometime or other. Things have been much the same since I last wrote.  There is in fact very little to report. I am expecting to get 8 days leave for London pretty shortly now, &amp; as soon as I know definitely I will send you a cable asking you to send over some money.  The cable will be {"John Waterhouse, Chatswood, Sydney.  Cable Ten Commonwealth Bank, London, furlough, well, love, Leo Waterhouse France."} I hope this won't give you any trouble, Father dear.
