<p>volunteered for the 4th Division of Artillery. I am quite prepared to do my stripes etc in &ndash; the A.M.C right through is not what it is cracked up to be.  For instance I've learn't nothing but what I've taught myself &ndash; we have not to date done any decent ambulance work &amp; there seems to be no possible of us joining our unit. I have been doing nothing but in charge of fatigue partys, so have decided after due consideration to join the artillery, where we will probably have some fixed work &amp; probably learn a lot.</p>
