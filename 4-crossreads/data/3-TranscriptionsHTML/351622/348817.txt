<p>26 April 1916 Wed<br/>Fatigue work the best part of the day painting tents &amp; making them invisible from aircraft. Paid after dinner. Took a walk into Steenwerck with Marsh enjoying a good tea of eggs &amp; chips. 7.30 p.m. the whole front is lit up with star shells &amp; exceptionally heavy artillery duel. All the boys full</p>
<p>27 April 1916 Thur<br/>At 3.am this morning George Long &amp; Nick Beattie leave for old England on furlough. They are the first to leave the 5th Field Ambulance. Solid work all day loading &amp; unloading carts with manure. A rotten job. Went into Steenwerck to night adjourning to an estaminet where we met Sid Bragg &amp; Johnny [indecipherable]. Plenty of noise &amp; plenty of laughing</p>
