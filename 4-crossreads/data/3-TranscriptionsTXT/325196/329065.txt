 24.12.15 Fri 24th. Left Mudros at 9 o'clock this morning , &amp; as soon as we were clear of the submarines nets we had to put on life belts &amp; have to have them with us always, an artillery gun is also ready on the stern with two machine guns in case a periscope is sighted; The weather has been rather chilly &amp; drizzling rain during the last day or two, but are getting into warmer air tonight.We are getting plenty of good food here &amp; having an easy time. Capt White (Adj) is getting himself well disliked on board he called the sergeants together yesterday &amp; gave orders that the N.C.O.s are not to mix with the men in Egypt, &amp; everything is much stricter that it was before we went to Gallipoli; He will find the men will not stand too much of it.
