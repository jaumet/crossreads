<p>Here's a little sketch of our harbor &amp; the way we be in it  -  It's the crater of a huge volcano &ndash; very deep &ndash; foreshore &amp; then the side of the circular crater &ndash; thin lipped &amp; then the plateau or peaked tops of other volcanoes &ndash; wooded to the waters edge &amp; ribbed by pluvial denudation  -  Dense Coco Palm grows on foreshore &amp; a lot of undergrowth  -</p>
