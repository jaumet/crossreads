  
 Monday 16 October 1916 A glorious day in spite of a very few drops of rain in the morning : quite cool but bright & sunny. Left Arneke abt. 9.30 & on horseback I branched off at Ochtezeele to have a look at the old 1116 church. Came through really magnificent fertile country of an undulating nature : mangolds & beet being pulled : potatoes being ploughed out : maize being cut for cows : beans being stacked : lovely cabbages being cut : in one place wheat being thrashed, a horse on a treadmill supplying the power. The route was for a large part through lanes bounded by hedges where the hawthorn & brier berries looked beautifully red, & the intertwining blackberries were laden with lovely fruit which for some reason did not seem to be appreciated by the local people : not so by the soldiers! Gorgeous autumn tints shown on chestnuts & certain other trees. Nearing Watten the road skirted a steep slope below which was a fairly large canal & on its banks the populous town where a good deal of manufacturing seems to be done. From here we went on to Westrove, a very small townlet with scare & scanty billets. A cold night.
