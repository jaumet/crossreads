<p>France Poziers July 30th<br/>Lose a few more men to day leaving our platoon with six men Dug a trench on our left, in conjunction with the tommies In this operation we lost a few more men one each side of me being put hors de combat   &amp; I wasn't sorry when we where called in. As the Huns had spotted us   &amp; we where getting a warm time from their Machine Guns Volonteered to carry water from Contalmaison a mile distant owing to a heavy barrage fire from German 5.9 had to return to firing line again   &amp;</p>
<p>France Poziers July 30th<br/>Returning was worse than going. Out of our party only a few of us remained. Being almost choked with sulphor, from bursting shells was in a terrible plight. Lost our guide which made things worse. Caught like rats in a trap We gave up hope of ever getting out alive   &amp; trusting to Providence. Which came when the germans eased down a bit, made a bold dash for it  The sights I met on my way back I'll never forget The mangled forms of what used to be men   &amp; the groans from the wounded was terrible</p>
