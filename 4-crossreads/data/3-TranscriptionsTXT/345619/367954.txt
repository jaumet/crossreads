 [Post script at the top of the page] Arrived safely in England 11/1/18 will write when I get time. A. 
 H.M.T. Leasowe Castle 26-1-18 My Dear Mother I don't suppose the last letter I wrote you has left Egypt up to the present, but by this time you probably know from the Cable, that I arrived at Egypt safe &amp; well. I have written yards of letters to Annie, I know you will hear anything of interest in them and will not expect me to write the same amount to you as it would only be a duplicate of Annies, and another thing, I have to write to Annie or she might divorce me. 
 I got few little things for you in Egypt for you, and hope they arrive safely, and that you will like them. 
 We are now on board a ship for the dash across to Italy. They seem to take this part of the trip very seriously here, judging by the precautions taken, We are all well and as happy as possible, This is a most interesting country to see, &amp; would like to have more chances of seeing it, I am sorry I could not get more snaps here, but the days are very short, &amp; there are only a few hours in the day that are suitable for snaps. I will be glad when we get to where-ever we can get some letters from home, so I can here how every one &amp; every thing is getting on. I have just bought 100 oranges for 5/- from a boat along side. The natives generally ask much more than they can expect to get, &amp; quite expect to be beaten down. No more now, Mother dear, &amp; don't worry about, Your Son
