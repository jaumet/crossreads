 ABASSAN KEBIR 
 Reveille 3 A.M. & reached Camp in time to see a good aerial fight, but the HUN got away. We have some new fast planes now. Back in the Dirt & dust & stand to arms etc., still we had a good spell of 10 days at the Sea. RABBITS were issued in lieu of meat tonight - I suppose trapped,  but  they've given me many a sleepless night, when the beggars would not take the poison, well our men don't like em but we eat to live & after all it's a change from BULLY, provided the weather is not too HOT - it is WAR. Posted notes yesterday & some snapshots. I hope you get them O.K.
