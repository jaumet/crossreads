<p>June Thursday 14 1917</p>
<p>Busy night. Patients need a lot of attention. Have one ward surgical &amp; other medical. Former takes up all our time. They are all chest wounds &amp; in almost all cases pneumonia follows as in a  [indecipherable] sequence. Medhurst, Pittams, Skinner &amp; Williams all very bad. <br/>Rather like work of attending tho tis very constant. Sister Wood a good sister &amp; considerate.</p>
