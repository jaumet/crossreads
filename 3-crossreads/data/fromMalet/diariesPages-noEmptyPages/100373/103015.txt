Oct 8th Saturday 1914. Sydney NSW

After a great deal of hesitation I decided to volunteer for Active Service, in the war against Germany and Austria. I had gone up to Victoria Barracks twice previously, but had turned away for reasons all my own, before finally submiting myself for Medical Examination.

Today passed the Medical Test and became attached to the Australian Army Medical Corps. After having taken the oath, I was told to report back on the Monday following.

Oct 10th Monday.

Reported at the Barracks. Supplied with a suit of dungarees and a white sun-hat. Marched out to the parade ground, dressed in the above, and put through some elementary drill.

Our sleeping quarters were in the large drill hall at the barracks. There we stayed for a fortnight. We were very fortunate with regard to our kit. We were provided with everything essential to Active Service conditions, three days after joining up.

After a fortnight’s stay in the baracks, a week of which I spent going to the Sydney Hospital for training, we went into Camp at Queen’s Park, Waverley as No 2 Australian General Hospital. It was a splendid camp and was more like a week-end camp for pleasure purposes than military purposes.

The work there was of a routine
