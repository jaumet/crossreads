<p>I have a return of the beastly rheumatics in the knees   Every night without fail I am awakened with the awful twinging, almost forcing a groan out of me.  As soon as I can get to a chemist I will fix myself up with amm. tinct: of <strike>giucum</strike> guiacum.<br/>When up before the Medical Board this morning, I was given a good overhaul &amp; classed B1 A2.  I was recommended for 8 weeks light duties &amp; have put in an application for the job of hospital orderly on an Australian Transport.  Strange to say they are short of men (A.M.C) who have had <u>at least 6 months</u> service in France, &amp; also men of hospital experience; as I can fulfil both of these demands I hope my application will be successful.  It is thus faintly possible I may be [text missing] to N.S.W. before many months are out.<br/>I have a fairly heavy cold on me at present &amp; a bit of an attack of laryngitis, but otherwise I am keeping A1.  Weather here fine but very, very cold.<br/>Must close now, with love to Walter, &amp; all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.<br/>My last mail from home was dated about 3rd October received two months ago.  Expect there is a bunch of letters about for me somewhere.  Keep to the old address.  Leo.</p>
