  
 Half an hour ago two men arrived here, they travelled by the S.S. Orsova, were disembarked at Suez and sent on by train to Cairo.  Dr Kennedy was one of the medical officers. Thinking tha Weston might still be one of the officers I sent him a wire to Port Said hoping to greet him there.  I was wondering what had become of the Orsova, and now by accident discover that she is a troop ship, she is advertised in the papers as to carry mails to Australia from Suez on the 11th Septbr, I judge therefore that she is to be a trooper for but one journey.   Good night. Good night. Good night. [A line of Xs and Os.] Caggie. Joseph. Kitty. 
 13.8.15. 9 p.m.  Tabbie dear;  a letter arrived from you to day, it was addressed correctly to D.M.S. but some silly ass, with a blue pencil in his hand wrote on the envelope The High Commissioner;  London., it therefore went to London, and has been sent back from there;  a Melbourne letter was treated in the same way.  What should be done to the fellow who had the blue pencil in his hand?  Perhaps he had good intention. 
 9.10 p.m.  A wire from Weston just handed to me.  It eminates from Port Said, 6.46. p.m.:  "Thanks wire.  Left to quickly to visit 219, but all well there; Should love to see you.  Regards."   His ship brought troups from Australia, landed some at Suez, and is reported to be taking others to England.  Did I know how long he might be in Port Said I might get chance to run down to see him. 
 Your letter bears date at end of 9th June, and is therefore some what behind others that have come to me.  I have not had a letter from Clarrie Bridge.  He is probably swelling round in England.  When he returns to his native land he will be a very much travelled man, such is the general thing in the navy, but in these times of war some of the ships go farther and faster than is the normal. 
 What a long time my Kitty stayed at Maitland.  But she deserved a holiday.  It is good that she is enjoying life.  The world is a very good place to live in, especially for those who have had sense enough to have put by enough money for the rainy day.  Why do you not write sometimes to my Buddie?  She is a sweet Buddie.   There now.  You did not express an opinion as to whether the removing of the trees from the Northern end of Macquarie Street was an improvement.   What think you.   What things my Joseph?   What thinks my Kitty?  My best wishes to Matron and Mary O'Connor.  Tell Mary that only cattle should eat tomatoes, weter in sandwiches or out of them.
