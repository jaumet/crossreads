<p>thankyou, and will be very handy in Port Said, though I hope not to have to use much of it. The news all round seems very good at present and it really looks as if a person may soon be able to get back to the ploughing again - I sincerely hope so anyway. Well Father I don&#39;t know what you will think of this long rigmarole (would like to know if you think its readable, as this is a sort of an experiment on descriptive letter writing for me) but you see I&#39;m only doing it for my own amusement and in the hopes that it will interest you and I&#39;m <u>not</u> a war correspondant, so of course you wont let any of it be published! My fountain pen went dry just up there, but I did not want to go away and fill it now, so I finished off with this green stuff, which was on the table beside me. It makes the other ink look a very dirty colour; does it not? I must stop now. With love to Mother and Hal and Fred. I am Your loving brother Robert C. Wilson</p>
<p>PS. I posted you a little booklet on Jerusalem a couple of days ago.</p>
