My dearest Father,Just a brief note before mail closes.  I have just returned from the Dr.  Went in just after dinner, & filled in necessary forms at Police Station, that I handed to the Govt Dr. (Dr. Johnson, with whom Dr. Walker is in co.) but he wouldn't pass me on account of my leg.  Nothing serious he said & with care would be right in about a week.  Advised me to try again end of next week if the wound is healed.   Will probably go in on Saturday week & try again.  Very frosty weather fine but cold.  Am keeping wellLove to all at homefrom Leo.
