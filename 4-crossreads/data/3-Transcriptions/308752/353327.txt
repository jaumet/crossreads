<p>open their lips to take a sip of water. Our Colonel was very much annoyed at the way the Brigadier (who had charge of the march) was treating the men. They call this getting men fit, why men from Gallipoli said that they would rather face Turkish shells &amp; bullets, than to even attempt a march like this again. Every few yards we passed kits &amp; packs &amp; rifles etc. that the men had thrown away,   They will be sure to get into trouble for this poor devils. Reached our second camping ground at about 5.p.m. very tired &amp; needless to say very thirsty. Two or three Brigades of New Zealanders were camped here, who were expecting us, &amp; put their tea aside for the men. We all thoroughly enjoyed it, stew &amp; a good cup of tea. All turned in directly after team, so as to get a well earned rest. Only about 160 men (infantry) arrived to time, out of about 4500 men. So you can imagine how severe a test it was.  The New Zealanders proved to be good fellows, they marched out &amp; helped to bring in the stragglers, a great number were brought it, in wagons,    The Zealanders were working till the early hours of the morning. A great number had to be put in the hospital. Our Colonel was pleased with the way the stretcher bearers came through the march. Only four fell out.</p>
