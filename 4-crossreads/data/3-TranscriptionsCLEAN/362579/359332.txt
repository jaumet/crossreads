Suppose Mother will be having a birthday cake soon. I wish I could have a slice. Perhaps next one I shall.
My dear Mother   &  Sisters.
About 2 days ago received Alice's letter of April 10th from Talbot, whichI was very pleased to get. So glad you   &  Eddy had such a nice holiday   &  trust the dear little chap has been able to go to school   &  will be happy there. It is really the best for children to go   &  compeat with others.
