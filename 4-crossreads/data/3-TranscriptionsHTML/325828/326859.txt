<p>My dearest Father,<br/>There is nothing definite through yet about my sailing I have been picked alright &amp; we heard we were sailing on 15th inst. but word came over that it has been postponed till probably the end of the month.  At any rate I will phone you up as soon as anything definite comes through.<br/>I have been very busy to-night though all my patients are sleeping quietly enough at present.  When I came on at 10 o'clock, I had one patient with a temp. of 105&deg;, but with attention, I have reduced it to 102&deg;.<br/>I am enclosing a letter from Joan Bentley that came to me by mistake through the envelope being addressed to Chatswood to Mr. J.L. instead of Mr. J. I don't know whether you could do anything for her at all as you don't come into contact with the boys as you used to, but if you could I would be so glad Father dear.  Perhaps Mr. Hinder might know of a suitable boy, or if you were at the school you might happen to find one.<br/>Raining out here to-night &amp; seems set in,<br/>With love to all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
