 My father's father built a house -- a little house & bare      And there I brought my woman home --  that heap of rubble  there !                                                                                 The soil of France !   Fat fields & green that bred my blood and bone!                                                           Each wound that sears thy  bosoms pride burns deeper than my own                                                                       But yet there is one thing to say, one thing that pays for all                                                                             Whatever lot our bodies know Whatever fate befall           We hold the line ! We hold it still !                                       My fields are no Man's Land,                                          But the good God is debonair And holds us by the hand_
