 AUSTRALIANS IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND

 The Australian Machine-gun Training Depot is located in Belton Park, at Grantham. The surrounding country (writes H.C.Polyblank, Australian Y.M.C.A. officer with the A.I.F.) is enchanting. Camp conditions are exceptionally good. In the training veterans of three years' service lend a helping hand to young warriors just preparing for the fray. Concerts, tournaments, and outdoor sports receive the encouragement of officers and enthusiastic support of the men. The sparkling spirit of Australia is unabated, despite the miles that separate us from the homeland of wattle and sunshine.
