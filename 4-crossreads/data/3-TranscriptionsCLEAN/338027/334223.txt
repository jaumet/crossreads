  
 Tuesday, 10 August, 1915 Still in charge of the collecting zone.  Our casualties are very heavy the wounded are lying in all directions, our ambulance was doing hospital duty as well as by feeding our patients & thus allaying the suffering.  The hill was taken & lost twice during the day, the Maoris & Gurkhas doing wonderful work, but some of Kitcheners army are very poor they lost the firing trenches that the N.Z. won & retreated 1/2 a mile.  The enemy brought up heavy reinforcements in masses German style but were moved down the shelf, one wounded officer said he got 2000 Turks with his Machine gun.  Our Warships bombarded the ridges all day & the enemy slaughter was terrific but it also killed many of our men.  I had the narrowest escape to-day taking a patient down on a stretcher two shells of shrapnel burst over our heads knocking my mate over but missing the patient & I by hairs breadth, the case landed at my feet & their was a great aeroplane duel between one of our men & a German Taube but the latter went for his life.  The Austs have won immortal fame and a man is proud to belong to them. 
 Wednesday, 11 August, 1915 We had a rather quiet day there seems an ominous lull in the fighting.  The English Reinforcements did not prove too good, the Turks are making a great stand on the ridge, but our guns both naval & here are cutting them to pieces.  We had a gruesome task to-day, we had to bury a dozen dead men, this was done for health sake as the stench was unbearable, we put rough crosses over them at their last resting place.  Another of our men was knocked out, shot through the stomach, our [indecipherable].  The Col & tent division arrived to-day when the heaviest danger was over, but we were glad of the reinforcements.  Achi has reported to be fallen, the Turks.  The hills around us are just alive with snipers & spies dressed in our clothing, our men arrested them, instead of shooting.
