<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>With reference to your letter of the 13th September, relative to your application for a telephone connection at your office, I am directed to inform you that it has been ascertained that there are 121 applicants for telephone service with prior claims, but you will be given preferential treatment, in common with other returned soldier applicants, as soon as equipment is available.</p>
<p>As your premises are situated in the area that is served by the new City North Automatic Exchange, you will be connected to that Exchange when material is available. It is not possible to provide you with service as present, as there is no accommodation available, but it is anticipated that sufficient equipment will come to hand in about six months to enable 200 lines to be connected.</p>
<p>The Chief Electrical Engineer proposes to visit Sydney at an early date with a view to seeing whether or not it will be practicable to connect any addditional subscribers to the new City North Exchange or the existing City Manual Exchange.</p>
<p>Your faithfully,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Mr Shepherd?]</p>
<p>Secretary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. L.W. Jaques,</p>
<p>14 O&#39;Connell Street,</p>
<p>Sydney.</p>
