Dear J. Your Birthday, today, if my memory does not play me false, and though it is rather late to send wishes .. still I send them and had I the means, would certainly send something more substantial So far as news is concerned I have very little of interest to tell you, for here, one week is very much the same as it's predecessor, Save perhaps, that we may have a little more rain, or snow, one week, and a little extra frost or mud the next, this week we are having three of them at once, a little rain, a little snow, and a dickens of a lot of mud. "and we cant shuffle the blame, onto the War, the National party, or the strikers, so have to curse the climate. Over here, one wishes that the human species, were of the Hybernating variety of animal. Then the climate would not matter, so much .. over here many a man who cursed the heat out in Aussie, would gladly go anywhere west of Bourke if he were given his discharge, on condition that he did so .. I'm not so sure that I would not do so myself. for with the war, and weather, to say nothing at all of a few other trifles, I'm just about fed up, "any I've not seen such a lot of fighting, there are plenty who have seen more. But, that's not what I sat down here to tell you, first I must thank you for your letter of 13th. Aug. which drifted in a couple of days ago .. strange how long some letters take, the last I had from Mother was Nov. 5th. it arrived same time as yours. Letters have not been coming along too freely of late, there seems to be a hitch somewhere, in the postal dept. it may be Transport difficulties across the channel, or the Postal Staff may be .. well not up to the job
