We are now watching each other, Brother Turk has entrenched & we are pretty right too, several of our planes proceeded to well & truly Bomb them this morning.Less sleep than ever now.   Cold better.  Posted notes yesterday as did not wish to run the risk of taking them to Constantinople.  We left a lot of Australian Papers in the Hods or Palms & w I'm wondering what our Germs & Turks think of Billy Hughes & Co-  & our recruiting- politics etc.  May have more interesting news shortly- I'm off to England this time if I get cracked.
