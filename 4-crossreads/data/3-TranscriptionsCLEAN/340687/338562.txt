  
 September, 1917. Saturday 15 Fine day & weren't called till 4. Out on job and did some work but had to stop at 8.15 probably as a bombardment was expected. Home at 10 and walked both ways 12 enemy planes flying low over here about 11.30 and dropped 2 bombs and all got away safely. Spent afternoon writing and reading. Work at 9 to-night and out on pontoons but blocked on Warrington Rd as it was blown up and walked rest. 
 Shelling intense and stopped work several times - Luckily no one hit although 3 & 4 struck it heavily. Walked home usual way & still strong. Very tired. Each section digs a strong point after stunt Probably on Wednesday.
