Seven were killed outright &amp; a good number wounded.  Our hydro plane has endeavoured to locate the position at various times but without success.  Great excitement prevailed along this particular beach this morning when a horseman was observed advancing towards our camp with a very large handkerchief in the air;  the token of surrender.  It proved to be a Turkish officer who showed evidence of a very rough time &amp; his own statement proved that such was the case.</p>
