<p>went down through Corbie  &amp; stopped at the Y.M. for a drink of cocoa. Corbie is a lovely town, prettily situated on the Somme, with some very nice buildings, &amp; it is a shame to see it shattered. We walked through Corbie &amp; on through lovely country, the crops all out in, &amp; flowers growing wild in the fields, red poppies among blue &amp; white flowers. The Crops, like the villages have had to be abandoned when Fritz pushed in March. We came finally to a village called Lahoussoye &amp; were told that the 37th Battalion was camped hereabouts, &amp; we are to take their pozzies when they go out. All the directions we got were practically nil, but I suppose being Australians, they thought we had plenty of savvy &amp; could find the place. Nearly every soldier we asked on the road, belonging to other Australian divisions, hadn't the slightest idea, but at least we found them. A, B, C &amp; D Coys were spread all over the  compass. Merrett &amp; I went to C &amp; D, &amp; the two for A &amp; B left us a mile further back. I got there at 3.30, went to the cook-house; &amp; had a bonza feed, roast rabbit &amp; potatoes. I don't know when I last tasted roast spuds. I had a chat to the 37th chaps, &amp; then looked up the company sergeant major, he showed me round the pozzies. It is a lovely spot here tall green</p>
