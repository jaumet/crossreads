  
 be renewed. What sort of a name has the Twentieth over in Australia? At Gallipoli it was known from one end of the line to the other. I suppose you have already heard that we were holding the key of the position at Anzac, & when we were relieved the relieving battalion were not game to hold the position on their own; so the rest of that brigade was put in support. Even with that strength there they lost most of the underground works & things got so bad that we had to go back. As soon as we got settled they withdrew the supports, & although it was pretty hot the first few days we got superiority again. I'll write again soon but the bugle has gone now. 
 Your affectionate son
