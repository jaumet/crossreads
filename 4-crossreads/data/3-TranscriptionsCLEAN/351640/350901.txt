Today there is a terrific bombardment all round.  Dunkirk is being bombarded again also Furnes [Veurne] from early morning.   Taubs [Taubes] over nearly all night and day.  A few of the Furnes shells have fallen short and dangerously close to our hospital.
For several nights there has been big cannonading something big must surely happen soon.   Oh! it is a sight to sit at ones window and see these great flashes.   It all seems to facinate one so
