 Letter writing and studying.  In the afternoon the Camp Commandant arrives and after filling in our Demobilisation Papers we are told that for certain reasons "The Anzac Coves" are broken up & no longer exist as a Concert Party.  We are then given a choice as to our next individual move - Application for "Corner of Blighty" - The spell is at last broken.
