  
 without a single days Training - my S.C. is young Mackenzie of Duntroon the only Survivor here of seven of them - There is no single C.O. - 2nd in Cmd - my qm N.S.W. Rgms - Sqn. S.M. Sqn. qm - ORC left to us. Holswick is in England disabled, and Gollan his successor also gone - all our Batman evaporated, so we are rather a bag of Newnants, but what then are we all gold - And the finest on earth - As of course are all the auxiliaries & N. 3s excepting the 5 Krim shankers who have jobs away and don't get back - This is one I make to difficulty as the ironical arrangements are bad so bad so far as the cooperation we receive from them in sending the fit back-  They are heard of all over the world. Some in London, India, Florence, Malta, Egypt etc and the doctors help us none - They have had no experience of the professional coldfector who beats them every time. - This war knocks the mickeing cover out of all. The F.S.Rgms and all our pet theories - and so far as I can see war now resolves itself into (1) Superiority of heavy long range Guns with Superior mobility (2) Superabundances of Ammunition for same (3) Numbers of Machine guns (4) Bombs & grenades including day range (800 yds) Trench mortars and short range 40 to 300 yds Mobile Mortars which can be quickly moved from place to place - in Trenches - (5) Bayonet (6) and not the least essential pick & shovel (we have not used an entrenching tool here).
