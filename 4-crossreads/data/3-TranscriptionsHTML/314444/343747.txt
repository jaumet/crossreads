<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>It is with feelings of admiration at the gallantry of a brave Australian soldier who nobly laid down his life in the service of our King and Country, that I am directed by the Honourable the Minister to forward to you, as the legatee of the late No.874, Sergeant T. H. Hill, 19th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, the Bar to the Military Medal which His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to award to that gallant soldier for conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty while serving with the Australian Imperial Expeditionary Force.</p>
<p>I am also to ask you to accept his deep personal sympathy in the loss which, not only you, but the Australian Army has sustained by the death of Sergeant T. H. Hill whose magnificent conduct on the field of battle helped to earn for our Australian soldiers a fame which will endure as long as memory lasts.</p>
<p>I shall be obliged if you will kindly let me know whether it comes safely to hand by signing and returning the attached receipt slip.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br/>(Sgd.) J.M. Lean.<br/>Major,<br/>Officer i/c Base Records.</p>
<p>Mrs. A. Hill,<br/>"Euterpe"<br/>Kurraba Road,<br/>Neutral Bay. N.S.W.</p>
