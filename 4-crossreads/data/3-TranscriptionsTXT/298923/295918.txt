 9 September 1918 Monday Went Jerusalem to sit on a Board of Enquiry  into the loss of 400/-/- Cash stolen from AIF Canteen-  Road very dusty &amp; "Jericho Jane" amused herself by firing long range shots with her naval gun into Jericho-  Camping near Railway Station at Reinforcement Camp was like a Miller on arrival from the Dust-  Will be up here for 3 days I expect a nice cool change-
