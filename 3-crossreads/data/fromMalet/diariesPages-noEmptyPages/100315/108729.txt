30/3/18 ? La Basse Ville
before dusk. At 7.30 went up the line and walked round to La Basse Ville where I saw my two firing line O.Cs and Major Dooley having a yarn. The place was all dripping and wet. The Billjims standing to arms were all encased in ground sheets and all fairly cheerful. Some of them were not wearing their water-proofs because out on patrol or on wiring party they glisten. A shrewd old bird is our Billjim. Back to Bn. H.Q. calling first at the R.A.P. The night was most devilishly dark and we kept tumbling all over the shop.
