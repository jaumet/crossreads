<p>[Written note on top of the printed letter]<br/>The Gen. Sec: YMCA wrote saying that the money would be spent on a building which would be for the users comfort of all soldiers.</p>
<p>[Letter in "Egyptian Gazette]<br/>RED CROSS &amp; Y.M.C.A.</p>
<p>To the Editor, "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
<p>Sir, - "Australian Woman" desires to thank the General Secretary, Y.M.C.A., for his indulgent criticism, but must point out she is labouring under no misapprehension. On the contrary, the General Secretary, Y.M.C.A., has quite missed the point at issue. The money was subscribed, &amp; earmarked in Australia, for a specific purpose, that of providing comforts &ndash; not comfort : a delicate distinction &ndash; for our soldiers, not to be expended on the erection of buildings, no matter what purpose the buildings might, when completed, be used.</p>
<p>With regard to the disposal of funds, as a matter of fact "Australian Woman" happens to know that various members of the Australian Council in Cairo have never been consulted in the matter.</p>
<p>Thanking you in anticipation,<br/>Yours, etc.,</p>
<p>Australian Woman.</p>
<p>Rossmore House, Cairo, July 14.</p>
