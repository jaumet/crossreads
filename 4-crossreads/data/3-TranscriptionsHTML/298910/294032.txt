<p>it is hard to say, but that our own lads suffered from our own stray shells which dropped short into our own trenches.</p>
<p>Boys who were wounded at Gallipoli, say that last night was hell &amp; Gallipoli was not in it. Got orders about 9.30 am to move out, as our Dressing Station was not safe, owing to roads about to be closed during next few days &ndash; Packed up in double time &amp; our section moved our about 12 noon &ndash; Left A &amp; B Sections to fix up balance wounded &amp; evacuate them.</p>
<p>Marched about 4 miles towards Armentiers &amp; took possession of a fine big Woolen Factory owned by a German, but now deserted, cleaned up &amp; made preparation to receive 1,000 men if necessary, we may have to hold up to that number &amp; evacuate them first opportunity when roads are open. About 5 pm 14th Field Ambulance blew in to give us a hand, so we expect something big &ndash; As I was too busy dressing this morning I missed my turn to go to the trenches. 3 of our Stretcher Bearers missing &ndash; 8 pm got word to prepare for heavy casualties.</p>
