<p>Returning back. I was once more installed in the cook-house, we had ample choice of houses, as there had been a great exodus of troops recently. The huts as I shall call them showed some ingenuity in construction. I used to be at work constantly tiding up the place.</p>
<p>We were able here to live pretty well indeed. Often times a roast meal would be provided for the troops. We cooked for about 48. It was so good that the officer came along and dined with us. Eventually we got away and boarded the vessel that was to take us across to France.</p>
<p>We sailed from Alexandria, one of the oldest towns in the world but about 1898 the old houses were abolished and new ones were put up in their places.</p>
