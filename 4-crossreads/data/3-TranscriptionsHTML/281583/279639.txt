<p>It is a bit of a pang to leave my little Pony of whom I am genuinely in love with, but it cannot be helpful &amp; I suppose it is only me who knows how sorry I am in leaving him. I have had him now 9 months  - in Egypt &amp; France &amp; during that time he has been constantly under fire &amp; escaped without so much as a scratch. It is also a bit of a pang to leave all the chaps with whom I have been closely associated with for the past 12 months but again never mind.</p>
<p>13.9.16 Wednesday</p>
<p>I left Reningalt at 7.45 am &amp; proceeded to join up my new unit as S.Sgt Supply 29th AASC same train. After a very monotonous wagon ride I arrived back in France at their lines at 2pm &amp; went straight onto the issue. As far as I have gone it is a very decent job about 3 hours work &amp; I am finished for the day.</p>
<p>My Section are a very decent lot of chaps among whom I struck 1 of the old [indecipherable] Boys &amp; one from Merrylands named Len who is my clerk. The weather is bitterly cold &amp; I can scarcely hold my pencil. I intend writing</p>
