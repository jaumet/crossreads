<p>4/1/18 London Belgrave Mansions Hotel<br/>chief topics of discussion. We dined well, waited on by a silent neat maid, in quite the old English style. They had some splendid sherry with a fascinating bouquet and haunting taste. Left at 9.45 and trained to London Bridge which we walked across. The broad silent river quietly bubbling on &amp; no one else on the bridge. Passed the monument which a policeman said was William IV &amp; took a tube. The tube not as good as Paris. An English A.S.C officer fat, gross &amp; evidently boozed sleeping with head on the shoulder of a little girl. Reached Victoria about 12 and made all arrangements for being called early. Nearly all the employees at this hotel are "Swiss". Packed up and then arranged to be called.</p>
<p>5/1/18 <br/>Up at 7 and much bustle. Left at 9 by taxi for Paddington after the usual orgie of tipping. Reached Paddington early &amp; put in time on the platform until getting a good seat in the heated carriage of the G.W.R. Another dull and foggy day</p>
