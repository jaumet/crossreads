  
 Mon. Sept. 17.  Left Racquingham.  Last night we slept in the Orderly Room.  Stan Wright & a few more of us.  We turned out at 6, & got ready for the Road.  Left Racq. about 9  & marched about a mile along the Road till we joined up the Rest of our Brigade.  It was quite a warm day & the Juice ran pretty freely.  We tried a new idea on this march, forming ourselves into Gun Teams.  Instead of carrying our Gear on our Backs, we loaded it on Spiders & hauled it along.  "Shag" Miles, Woodsy, were among my Team & they were real good Haulers.  On the Road, Miles & I dropped out to find the "correct Time".  Before we started on the march I dashed down to the Photogrs  & got the remainder of the Photos.  Arrived Steenvoord about 6 p.m. 
 Steenvoorde Tues. Sept. 18.  Last night I slept next to Billgy May, on the cold hard floor of the Barn.  Luckily there was plenty of straw.  We left the Farm, where we billeted immediately after Break. & marched through Poperinghe where our Nursing Section have taken over the D.R.S.  The Bearers were soon set to work, sorting out poles & Tents & pitching  them.
