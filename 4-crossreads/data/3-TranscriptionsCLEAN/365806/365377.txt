There's only one consolation re the mud in the trenches & that is that instead of being up to your neck, it only reaches half way up your thighs.  At present we are in reserve about 3 miles behind the line & though continually shelled nobody ever gets hit.  Dorothy's muffler had a very smelly end in a very mushy trench.  We were stooping to avoid some of Fritz's hate & I happened to put my foot in the end of it - the muffler not the hate - with the result that it was immediately sucked under 4 feet of thick mud & drowned.
We are in rather a historic place &  it is rumoured that there was a village here before the war, it is now a mass of big shell holes
