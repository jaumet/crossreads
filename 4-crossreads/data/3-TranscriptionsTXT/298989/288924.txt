26/12/15Boxing Day broke with a very fine sunrise and although cloudy cleared later on but not as good a day as yesterday. Church parade at 1000 went off well. After an inspection took place of the men and a number were found with unshaven chins and long hair. During the afternoon their mates were busy with clippers and razors brightening them up.
After lunch met Harry Conway and walked across to the village of Portiana and another place both thronged with soldiers. Dirty places with pigs very close to living quarters. An old church on a rocky place surrounded by a stone wall. Watched some women grinding corn and a grain like small peas between two circular stones &ndash; the bottom one fixed the top with a handle revolving. A laborious operation as each handful was ground several times and winnowed by the lady blowing on it. An Indian sepoy was after a chicken but the answer was "finish". All nations around the Meditteranean seem to know this word and use it more extensively than any other.
Called on Dicky and found him comfortable we stayed for afternoon tea. He says we go on Tuesday but he only goes by rumour. His location will probably be shifted to Alex. Furpheys today (1)We are all going to be turned into mounted infantry (2)Our new camp is being prepared at Tel-el-Kebir (3)Greece &amp; Roumania have joined on our side.
Some good football matches in progress today. Sent Cawthorne and a party off to see if they could get 70 bags of mail belonging to us said to be on beach. It is the one thing our men need to make the Christmas complete. Drummond unwell today. This harbour takes my fancy &ndash; so capacious and yet the narrow entrance with its guns is easily defended. The boom is a double one. Turned in about 2130. Drummond ill.
