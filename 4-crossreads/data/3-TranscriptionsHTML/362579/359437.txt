<p>I shall be expecting Aust. letters this week. It seems strange to get yout letters answering mine of last June. I'm sorry I cannot remember that I wrote in letters that have gone astray.</p>
<p>There is nothing exciting these days but I'm very well   &amp;  comfortable. Shall be quite ready for fun when on Leave</p>
<p>Hope you are all well   &amp;  happy. Must have some tea now to warm myself.</p>
<p>Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all. Love to all my friends</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
