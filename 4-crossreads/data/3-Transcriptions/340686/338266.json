<p>a few red ones and the artillery started a fairly heavy bombardment. Fritz replied feebly and concentrated mostly on the front trench. A remarkable phenomenon was a series of 8 flares connected sent up in twos following each other at about half hour intervals. Fritz's flares were not confined to the front line and some went upon his hill presumably signals. Returned at 11 arriving at 12.</p>
<p>25-12-16<br/>Got breakfast and stayed in bed all day until towards evening when we cleaned up a bit. Received our 3f worth of free goods from canteen including a pudding and had them for dinner. Two mails came in but nothing for me at all.</p>
