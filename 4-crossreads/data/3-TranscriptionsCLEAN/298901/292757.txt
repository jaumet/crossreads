Provisional Field Ambulance 33rd Division joined us for experience.  They were soon surrounded being still an object of curiosity.  These Yanks are a fine crowd, being fresh with plenty of spirit & will do well.  They are proud to be with us.  One infantryman said to me, They ought to put us over the top straight away as we have plenty of spirit being fresh & having been talked into it are now at our best.
Thursday 25th JulyA very quiet day, rain at odd intervals.  In the evening we now have a hand at cricket.
Fridau 26th JulyNothing doing.  Had a splitting headache.  Rain during the day.  Expect to move in a couple of days now.  Just been published that the British Gov. is going to pay gratuities to Australians who possess the V.C. M.C. D.C.M. & M.S.M. so I'm included.  The idea tickles me a lot, it will be a connecting link with my army days after the war.  Our 3rd largest liner has been sunk.
