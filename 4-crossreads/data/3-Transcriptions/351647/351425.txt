<p>feel so frantically keen on it, I'm still a bit down over Jim &amp; also I have to go alone.  Madame Herault (who used to live in Sydney) is away in the country et ma petite Jeanne (de Amiens) que ete a Paris pour <strike>deux</strike> huit semaines <strike>revendrai</strike> elle retourna a Amiens dernier Lundi, par consequent je sourrai personne.</p>

<p>My dear I've been to Paris &amp; I feel <u>almost</u> as if I'd been to Heaven.  It is a simply enthralling place.  Even those first spring days in in dear old London with Tan didn't uplift me as much as my little stay in Paris.  It is a good thing I have the magnet of you dear people in Australia pulling me back irrestibly otherwise I don't think I could stay away from Paris &amp; London for long.  Its the most beautiful place, Paris lovelier far &amp; more fascinating than I ever even dreamed a place would be.  I feel almost ashamed to enjoying it so when so many of my pals have gone or suffered &amp; when I won't see Jim any more I must have a light nature after all.</p>
