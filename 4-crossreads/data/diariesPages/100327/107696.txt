Found mess filthy and no sign of breakfast. Sat round brazier yarning until 1000 when bacon came along and we put it on the brazier eat slices with fingers using big hunks of frozen bread.

Reason for breakfast fiasco said to be pipes being frozen and no water available.
Afterwards went to Greek canteen and had a penny cup of cocoa and then to seafront.
