 The history of this Egypt is intimately connected with the basis of the modern world, which as acknowledgment of the separation of the ancient eara [era] from our time, marks all events as before or after Christ.  In the first book of the New Testament and the second chapter, the 13th to the 22nd verse, is told the story of the flight of Joseph, Mary, and the Child Jesus, from Bethlehem into Egypt.  Even, unto this day, are persons shown the places where the holy family rested during their sojourn in this country.

Such as have been more fruitful of good results, than have followed the acts of any single family of all time.  Strange 'tis that in Egypt, as elsewhere, the saying holds good that &ndash; "A prophet is of little use in his own country".

It is common belief that many persons go mad during the prevalence of these winds.  Their acute duration is from three to five days, becoming so at any hour during the fifty days.
