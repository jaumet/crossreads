<p>On Monday afternoon left here about 3.30. p.m. with Lt. Wright Smith  took tram to Cairo &ndash; had Ice-cream    &amp;  then got a Garry  &amp; drove out to the Zoological Gardens. They are beautiful &ndash; in the ground where an old Egyptian Palace was &ndash; the walks are made of different colored pebbles (cream, black, red    &amp;  blue) &amp; very pretty designes. Each pebble cost 1 Piastre (about 2 1/2 d). There is a wonderful collection of animals &ndash; one huge "Hippo" <strike>&amp;</strike>, is tamed so well by the keeper that he does anything he is told. We did not have time enough to see much of the gardens but enjoyed it immensely. We had a lovely dinner out there, then got the Garry to Cairo &amp; motored at the rate of 35 miles to Hospital where we arrived just in time for me to go on duty. We were sorry to come back, it is so beautiful out driving at night. Next morning my friend left for Alexandria. Tuesday afternoon Sister Murray &amp; I went to visit Matron Cornwall at her hospital about 15 mins walk from here &ndash; Major Webb is the head of things there  We also saw him &amp; had a nice talk. The building is really a factory &amp; has been taken over for a 2nd Auxillary Hosp.</p>
