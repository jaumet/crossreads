<p>Monday 6 Nov. 1916<br/>Up a little before 4 o'clock &amp; set out with the General, but owing to the darkness &amp; greasy going caused by the drizzling rain, progress was so slow that the General soon decided not to go on, so we turned back &amp; went to bed again. About midday we went up to Bn. H.Q. getting back for a very late lunch. There were some showers &amp; a little hail, but in general the weather was fair. A mail came in from home &amp; was oh so welcome.</p>
