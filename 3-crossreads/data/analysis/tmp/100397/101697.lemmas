 ani secret of the fact , some of them are better off in Blighti than they ever were at home , but I wont say ani more about them for I guess you ll find it dri read . Late the weather has been with us , and I begin to believ that this place is at time " A Sunni Franc " but the end of the Summer is near and we may get bad weather at anytim . I can tell you it not a veri cheer prospect , Last October was enough for me , I was proper in the mud that time and will not forget it for quit a long time . The news today seem to be good the Hun is fight hard at part of his line but in mani place Hindenburg 's line has been broken and now the High Command is think hard , and wonder what will happen next , well let them wait and see . Have not heard of Nell Crom . for age She was further south and was right in the fight zone . I expect that Her Hos . had to pull out , and make for safeti . Had word from Overstrand all were well Mrs H. was overjoy to have all the Boy back Harold some of his mate were all on leav togeth Last mail brought along a letter from T. Kennett of Blue Nobbi . he has left the place and is now at Wallangra . had not seen the nag for quit a long time but thought that he was allright . Also had a letter from Grace Lord , have n't answer it yet , will do so later on . She said you had told her that I would be glad of news of the Old Place , so she wrote . That about all for the present You will see by the way this is finish up that Im in a hurri so will say no more except to Send Love to all at home from your Affec Bro Chas G.P This paper was captur near here from the H. Qrs of the " Schwer Grupp " which I take it mean the " Right Group . " or right wing of an artilleri divis ?
