<p>25/4/19<br/>Bingen<br/>but could not be definitely certain that I located the celebrated chateau. It is wonderful to see how every tiny plot of ground here is under cultivation. The Rhinegau [Reingau] stretch of the Rhine is very lovely but I like it best above Rudesheim and Bingen because it is more wild. Passed the gigantic statue of Germania &ndash; each nostril of her is said to be large enough to receive a man. Bingen ("sweet Bingen on the Rhine") is faced by a terraced bluff of vineyards and on the opposite side we passed Bishop Hatto's Mauseturm &ndash; a low tower now used for navigation signals. The old ruined castles seemed  to become more frequent in this gungy part. Burg Rheinstein the Enemy brothers and the Stolzenfels were all noticeable ones. The large cliff of La Lovelly</p>
