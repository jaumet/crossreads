falling into bad habits.
Tuesday 18th JuneFine weather, very few wounded but more sick.  A Fritz brought one of our balloons down towards evening.  He dived out of some clouds & the two observers jumped out with their parachutes but one, through some accident failed to open & he fell like a stone.  The enemy shelled the batteries rather heavily in our neighbourhood also Franvillers, 300 yds up the road & another village a bit further away.  So far he has not shelled our station but we hear them passing overhead quite often.
Wednesday 19th JuneRained during the night & the roof of my dugout proved faulty, result being that my blankets were wet.  Quiet during the day but had a few gas patients in.  Mud in terrible state, the old Somme variety.  Rain at intervals during the day & I repaired our roof & made a mattress to sleep on so hope for a better night.  Mail in today & tells me that Syd has another daughter
