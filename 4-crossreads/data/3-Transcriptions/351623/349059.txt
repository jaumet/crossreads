<p>aboard again just before 10 oclock at night, not much too soon as we got under weigh shortly after 10 oclock for the last run to Aussie. We left some soldiers &amp; one sailor behind in Colombo, we also picked up some trays that were left behind by other troopers.</p>
<p>2nd Feb to 9th Feb<br/>At sea in Indian Ocean. Passed Cocos Isld on 6th.</p>
<p>10 Feb 19<br/>Arrived Freemantle, but find to our disappointment that there is a great Flu scare throughout Aussie &amp; that no leave will be given anywhere &amp; that all troops will be quarantined in their respective ports. A good welcome after 4 years.</p>
<p>11 Feb 19<br/>W Australians were disembarked today. Got underweigh for Albany.</p>
