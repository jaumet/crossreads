<p>Monday 23 July 1917</p>
<p>Am afraid writing is impossible at times. Raided Turkslast night. They lost 100 killed, we a few. Still doing these days &amp; nights as well. Owing to a fog during one of our RAIDS we lost a good chance.</p>
<p><strike>Out all night &amp; in the morning were surprised at seeing our Division marching towards us, i.e. towards</strike> BEERSHEEBA or BIR SABA originally BIR meaning WELL &ndash; EL place of SABA &ndash; Seven &ndash; 7 Wells - <strike>our intelligence!!! said it had been evacuated &amp; we simply had to march in. Well we are back in our old Camp not in BIR SHEEBA tonight</strike> - VERY HOT by day &amp; heavy FOGS by night &ndash; wets everything.</p>
