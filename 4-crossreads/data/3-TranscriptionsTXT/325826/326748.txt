 Pension Wales&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. 5.5.16 Cairo. April 4th 1916. 
 P.S.  Would you please give Millie &amp; Evelyn the news about Rid's cable, I simply cannot write as often as I used to. O.L.O. 
 My very dear Father &amp; Mother, No Australian mail for nearly a fortnight now so that in a couple of days there ought to be the joy of getting one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you get a cable I sent on 29th. March, saying "Walter gone."  As in the previous one concerning Rid &amp; Leo, we decided that it was useless trying to be more explicit for fear they might not let the cable through at all.  It should have got to you quickly for they will not allow me to send the cheaper week-end wires, it is only soldiers who are allowed to send them, and though they only pay half-price they are not sent so promptly. It was the next morning after I had posted my last letter to you that Wal came in about 11 o'clock and announced that they were to go that evening to Alexandria &amp; embark the next day.  However much one is prepared for these "going offs" they always seem sudden and upsetting when it actually comes to the time, don't they?  I'm sure you feel like that about the cables.  And while I am speaking of that, I do hope it is not unkind to send you these bald cables; just for a minute or two I thought it would be kinder not to, but when I put myself in your place &amp; thought it out I decided that even if it were unsettling &amp; upsetting at the time you would be glad of as close knowledge of the boy' whereabouts as possible: Wal &amp; I agreed on that point though whether we were both wrong you will have to tell us when we come home. Well that morning that Wal came in with the news we talked for a little while, then went out to Groppi's (and with all mention of this famous restaurant I believe I have never happened to tell you that it is only &frac12; minute from the Pension)
