I think the Turks must have been celebrating the glorious Fourth because they kept up a heavy big gun fire all day  &  the best part of the night
1915 July 5Monday
The 16th Bat left here for Imbro. Is this afternoon in a number of trawlers which were heavily bombarded w/- shrapnel by the Turks.We hear from some N.Z. artillery men that the cause of all the shelling of our water tanks was an old water cart which looked just like a Howitzer from their position   &  the Turks must have thought the same.
