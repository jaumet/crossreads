the place - 4 hours it took  -  The Berrima leaves detachments here & then goes to Sydney  -  She may go to Europe  -  He told me there was a Native Hospital here in charge of 2 German doctors - one of whom had been under Ehrlich & spoke English  -  He said he'd seen cases of Ankylostomiasis   - Beri  - beri - Dysentry there  -  I must go & call as soon as I can  -
We then had lunch together & after lunch rested till 4 pm - then P & I resumed the initiative & P wanted to again see the old engine at the Wireless  -  Its 1 to 2 miles walk - up hill  -  I suggested commandeering a horse & trap  -  We went off to transport headquarters & got due permission & after some delay got fixed up with a trap built by Bell & Son of S.Brisbane & a small but sturdy pony  -  P. hates equines so I drove & off we went & very nice it was - talking & letting the horse work  -
