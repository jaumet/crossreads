<p>Nile from CAIRO and about 420 miles from Alexandria Very long way to go to water It takes about an hour to go there and return. We are now on the usual Camp routine and I don't mind saying that it does not meet <strike>where</strike> with the approval of the men. They like to be up and doing Cant beat trekking its good fun and good for the horses too. We are contemplating the reforming a Sergeants Mess but from what I can see of it there seemed to be a <u>mess</u> right enough. previous accounts have not been squared up and generally speaking things are not looking healthy on the face of things Probably have a meeting tonight and go into matters. Bobby Farnes of the Signal Troop goes away today as a first Lieutenant in charge of the 2nd Signal Troop. I have watched his progress from the rank of private through every grade up to that of officer.</p>
