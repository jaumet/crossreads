Sunday 12 May
Beautiful day.
This evening we went into the line to the right of where we were last took over an R.A.P. at Strazeele station about five hundred yards from our front line. We evacuate along the railway line on trucks line 4 feet 8" gauge. Things appear to be quiet here so far shell fire has been practically nil. Three patients came in last night, two of whom died here. The country about which I know well is as flat as a pancake the Boche has observation from Mont de Merris. We are living in a cellar of the house of a merchant of pommes des terres. Our first billet in France is only a couple of hundred yards north of here.

Wet to-day but very quiet on the front, in spite of changing over, we had no carries.
