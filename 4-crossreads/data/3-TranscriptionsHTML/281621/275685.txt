<p>Sunday 11<br/>Last night the 4th &amp; 5th went over on a raid which was an utter failure. Of the 100 who made up the party 75 per cent; were casualties. Our HDS is very inconvenient &amp; our colonel incapable.</p>
<p>Wednesday 14<br/>Went for a walk to Edwards post to show Perkins round. A stunt is expected shortly &amp; he is in charge of reserve squads. Came back through High Wood where many tanks are stranded &amp; many monuments erected to those who took part in the fighting there. The tanks are being cleaned in anticipation of being used again. No word of leave yet.</p>
<p>Thursday 15<br/>Tonight we were warned the Fritz intended bombing all rail heads.</p>
<p>Friday 16<br/>This morning I was awakened by bursting bombs, machine gun fire &amp; anti-aircraft firing. Fritz caught a big ammunition dump &amp; from reports he caused considerable damage. Great clouds of smoke roll over the hills a few miles away, and the explosions are almost continuous.</p>
