<p>Dear Mrs Read,<br/>I have the pleasure of conveying to you the appreciative thanks of the Members of Malvern Hill Red Cross Society for your most interesting address given to our Meeting (Public) on Oct. 26th.  All friends present expressed themselves in highest praise of your address, &amp; we think most kindly of you to take the trouble to accept the invitation to come from such a long distance to give us some idea of the work of our Doctors &amp; Nurses in Egypt as well as other incidents with regard to our brave men, which we very much enjoyed listening to, &amp; hope to work all the harder for our Red Cross.<br/>Please accept the thanks of our Branch with enclosed.</p>
<p>With kind regards<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>Y.E. Fry, Hon. Sec.</p>
