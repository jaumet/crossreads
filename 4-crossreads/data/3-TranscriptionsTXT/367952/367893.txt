 Dear Auntie Beat 
 Just got copy of the cable. It was addressed to Canon Wright so owing to rules and regulations of the Post Office I could not get an official copy. But these are the exact words of the cablegram. 
 "Canon Wright Merewether Officially reported Private Thrityseven Seventy (3770) Thomas Bell killed in Action, Please inform wife in Edwards St Merewether"
