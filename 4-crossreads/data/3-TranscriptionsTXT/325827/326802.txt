R 10.9.1619th May 1916Souvenir for Anna enclosed
Dear Father Mother & AnnI have just been one of the fortunate ones tonight -I received about 10 papers 2 parcels of sox and two letters. They have all been to Alex & readressed to 1st Au Div Artillery & all endorsed "not known FAB" & considering that 15th  F.A.B. is in the 2nd Division the delay is needlessly long. I am fairly hard on sox and this lot of 4 will set me up for quite a time. The two parcels were in your handwriting so someone at home is guilty of the kind thought & work re the sox. Thanks to whoever sent them. I did not notice any names attached to them so whoever should be thanked will be by this. I have written to Ol regularly & she has the latest news. Today has been one starting with the noise of guns in one direction, misty & warm. Later it was a perfect day, sunny now artillery plenty of planes including two enemy which got a real peppering from our guns but got away untouched. There is a wonderful fascination in watching the flash of light in the sky, the puff of smoke & wondering from near the shell has gone to the plane. It isn't so nice watching our own getting shot at & though the sky is like a mass of white clouds from shell bursts I haven't seen one of our planes brought down yet, though of course a proportion must get hit & brought down. Our men are just "great" in the air. With a dictionary in my hand & much shocking French grammar
