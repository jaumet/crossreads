<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>Yesterday there was delivered to me from Australia a New Years card from the Australian Trained Nurses Association whose office is in the Equitable Building, George Street;  also a letter from Dr. H. L. Harris dated, "Australian Hospital, Wimereux, France, 5/2/15".  Herschell appears to be in good spirits and flourishing, he wrote that: "Eames is A.1.  Dick is alongside of me while I write in the Golf Club.  We all get on well together and are very comfortable.  Was in London for 96 hours.  Have had a couple of letters from Carrie, she gives me all the news."  Won't he be pleased on learning of the arrival of the nephew?</p>
<p>A notice in the morning paper &ndash; "Sixty-five bags of mails from Australia were distributed to the various camps during yesterday."  I hope that amongst the letters will be some for me.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I dined with Dr. Schuber.  He is a native of Riga, the capital of the Baltic Provinces, Russia.  I enjoyed the dinner better than any meal since leaving Australia.  The cooking was of English kind.  The soup was a little greasy.  The fish was served with a slice of good lemon.  The fowl &amp; parsley sauce were O.K., the peach Melba was just correct.  I passed the curry.  The doctor is an educated gentleman, with a well stocked library of surgical books, a collector of stamps from places along the Mediterranean littoral.  Some of his specimens are valued in the books at &pound;50.  He is a batchelor, and if appearances be judged correctly by me a rich man.  He and his housekeeper have been very kind to me.</p>
<p>The number of our patients is rapidly diminishing and we shall be ready for any orders in a few days.</p>
<p>3-15 pm.  No letters have come so far for me.  Some one posted to me a copy of the Bulletin dated the 14 Jany. 1915</p>
<p>[Lieutenant Colonel  James Adam Dick (1866-1942), surgeon and army medical officer, embarked with the 3rd Australian General Hospital under Colonel Thomas Henry Fiaschi on 15 May 1915 on RMS Mooltan. He served at Lemnos and then in France in various roles, being promoted to Colonel in 1917 and placed in command of the 1st Australian General Hospital at Rouen.]</p>
