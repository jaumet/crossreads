  
 20 April, 1916 Salhia We went out & bivouaced last night & I struck horse picquet.  We did a bit better than the other two troops the last time B Sqd were out at Serapeum they got lost in the desert & a lot did not get back until morning.  We had to go out as covering party & came in to our lines at dusk.
