<p>something, when a snow-storm started, and as I couldnt persuade Bowen to come on I went back with him. War, as far as we are concerned just now &ndash; we are in reserve &ndash; is a quiet thing.  I have met  practically no drill since I have been in France &amp; very little discipline.  We have a fall-in in the morning, a rifle inspection, &amp; a few games, &amp; the rest of the day is ours.</p>
<p>Dec 21.<br/>I discovered that there is one place in Kemmel where there are still civilians &ndash; a quaint little shop with vulgar, highly colored cards &amp; an assortment of all sorts of foods.  Some diggers were knocking at the door, which was closed, and when I got near a woman opened it &amp; said "Horsh! Horsh! you will wake the baby!"  Fancy waking the baby that seems undisturbed by the guns! &ndash; for there really is a baby there, it seems.  But fancy also civilians hanging on in the battered place!</p>
<p>Dec 23<br/>Have discovered three things.  Neuve Eglise, Dranoutre, and a man to play chess with me at the <strike>School of arts</strike> YMCA &ndash; Beebe, who was a member of the School of Arts, Sydney.  He belongs to another <strike>troop</strike> battalion.  Neuve Eglise is the headquarters of our 3rd Brigade, and is almost as badly smashed as Kemmel.  Taking a straight line between Neuve Eglise</p>
