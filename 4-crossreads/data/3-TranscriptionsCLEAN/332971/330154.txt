  
 service to be held but the beautiful scenery of Marseilles is in sight - & twill be lovely to be on land again. 
 31.6.15 We landed or anchored at 3pm but the business of getting pass ports took us till 7 & having to be back on board by 9.30pm we saw little - but next morning we were up & away by 7 am having 4 hours.  Everything was most interesting - only we found our French diddent help us much.  The most notable place to see was the Church of Notre Dame de la Garde - which is built on one of the highest peaks & where you get a beautiful  view  of Marseilles & the surrounding Country.  I am sending most of you a picture of this - you will see at the top a statue of The Virgin & child - which represents them guarding the Sailors of the Sea.  Saw also the Cathedral of Marseilles - a grand building. Marseilles is a busy port - numberless large boats along the wharfs which seemed to me to extend quite 2 Miles in length & boats either side.  There were several troops marching in the streets.  Many of them Indians
