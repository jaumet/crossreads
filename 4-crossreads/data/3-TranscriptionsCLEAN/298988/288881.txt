May 13th  Firing went on pretty solidly all day today.  We got news that the H.M.S. Goliath was sunk a Turkish Torpedo boat, at Cape Helies.  It was also reported that the Turks sank her with our own A.E.2. that they captured.
8 p.m.  A patrol boat just came alongside of us with some cheerful news.  All the officer said was, "Admiral requests that you put all lights out, expect enemy submarine attack.  Good night.  Good luck to you."  The Captain then got our men busy preparing for it.

10 a.m.   Got orders to proceed to Imbros Island and anchor there.
10 p.m.  Nearly all vessels that are not immediately required are here in this Bay at Imbros.  Besides Transports there are three Men 'o 'War, the baloon ship, & the Aeroplane ship.  A seaplane that had been out flying returned just before dark & it looked fine as it alighted on the water, skimming along at a fast rate.  There are two Destroyers patrolling the entrance here, so I reckon we are pretty safe.  The report is that there are 5 German Submarines about.  One of them got "had" in Mudros Bay.  We have got an old barge done up like a Battleship with canvas funnels & wooden guns & other extras to look like the H.M.S. Tiger & a German Submarine put three Torpedoes into it & sank it.  As torpedoes cost a lot of money, they lost
