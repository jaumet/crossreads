  
 Aug 3 procession (minus the Anzacs) at 6.30 including a reed band & 2 "brassies". This child  is  on the boat roll alright. Am afraid though its going to be a 2nd or 3rd rate boat. Beautiful weather; temp' only 76 in the shade, nice spring weather 'twould be called in Sunny New South. Thousands of girls to choose from - What! 
 4 Boat Roll to be called again this morning. (Today is the Anniversary of Great Britains declaration of war against Germany). Got photos OK. The full length is alright, but the other is rotten.
