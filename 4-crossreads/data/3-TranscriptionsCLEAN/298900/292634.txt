  
 it so that now I have only to fix up the cross.  I wonder what "records" will say to me as I wrote & denied that the grave was there. 
 Tuesday 19th Feb    Cold but fine beautiful sunshine.    Aerial activity one fight taking place overhead - which I believe our plane was later successful.   Finished the Cross & gave it one coat of paint.   Tackled French again. 
 Wednesday 20th Feb    Made up an indent for drugs & sent it along for signature.   Nothing doing much except about 4 wounded through in the early morning.   A very successful raid on our sector.   15 men went over and brought back 7 prisoners without sustaining a casualty.   The bombardment we put up was very sudden, a whole brigade opening up & putting a wall round the point raided and as suddenly ceasing.
