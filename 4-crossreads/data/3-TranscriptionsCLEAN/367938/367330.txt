 - - - - - Had meant to write you quite a long letter but you have no idea of our discomfort here. The heat is intense - about 88 & like Sydney - no cool verandah to write on - only a blanket just over ones head. The flies are the ghastly limit - give one indigestion as one has to blow & bolt ones grub. I cannot grumble however as I have again been on board the "Sicilia": This time got very weak from starvation following on a weeks indigestion, owing to an issue of bread, mostly dough - & getting influenza on top of that, I was sent away.

I cld. write a good article on the carelessness & mistakes of everything from beginning to end & I'm awfully glad I went to Lemnos for I see now how the mistakes etc reach here: but must wait for a Chair & table & comfort. 
 I had to go off the Sicilia as she was off to Malta. On landing with 7 others I deposited my small kit bag & a box of food I was taking to trooper Knox of the Vic 4 L.H. from Graham, & eventually we separated & I was taken  by  alone by a Cpl to No 1 Hosp. (Australian).
