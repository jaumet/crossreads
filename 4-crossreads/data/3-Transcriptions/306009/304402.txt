<p>1915<br/>Aug. 6 Fri.<br/>Have during the last few days come across a rather decent Egyptian (a Copt). His father is the Govt. Minister for Finance.<br/>The Egyptians are of 2 religions &ndash; Coptic &amp; Mahommedan. The Copts are Christians, few in number, but staunch upholders of the British.  The majority of the people are Mahommedans &ndash; same religion as the Turks &ndash; and only respecting the British because of our superior strength.</p>
