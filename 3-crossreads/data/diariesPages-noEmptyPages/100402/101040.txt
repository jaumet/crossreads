Wednesday 13 March
Very quiet on the front, and what few casualties there are are from gas.
We are living well, doing nothing. Our meals are far better than we get at camp I am No. 4 chef.
Thursday 14 March
Wet to-day. In a raid last night by 10th 12th Battns. on our left, fifty prisoners were brought in. Fritz dropped a few showers of whiz-bangs about our dugout to-day some close. They appear to have been a H.E. shell a sneezing gas the object being to render one unable to wear the respirator. We opened a bombardment on Fritz to-night at 9.30 but so far no retaliation.
