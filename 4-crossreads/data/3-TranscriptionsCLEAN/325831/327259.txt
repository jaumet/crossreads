 down by these filthy strikers. Could not the necessary steps be taken to shoot a few of them or send them over for our long suffering Company commanders to deal with. I have been on three courts martial lately & rather enjoyed them. The prosecutor in two of the cases was conducted by Alroy Cohen. Cohen is quite fit & is of course in his glory if he can get hold of a Manual of Military Law & a Summary of Evidence. As a soldier his abnormally developed conscience will get him into serious trouble some day, he nearly drove one Company Commander to suicide. 
 We have a Battalion Canteen which is an excellent thing in its way, but it is often difficult to get sufficient stock transported. N.B. They  never  stock preserved ginger & not often chocolate. 
 Do you remember J.S. Anderson a freckled white-headed chap with a protruding lip who once lived in the same house as you. He is our Senior Major & a splendid fellow. 
 Best love to all. There is nothing I want except a trip home. 
 Affectionately yours 
 C.R. Lucus
