 After a good nights sleep I have to send a sapping party of 24 men out at 6 am. 4 more of my platoon go to hospital this morning. Not much doing that we hear of. A few shells come over but do no damage. x Go into trenches at 7 pm We are making the trenches very safe   &  comfortable but hope that no rain comes yet.
