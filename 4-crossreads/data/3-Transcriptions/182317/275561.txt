<p>Selborne Chambers 174 Phillip Street Sydney 10th June, 1965<br/>Dear Judge, On the morning of your retirement from the Supreme Court I would like to offer you my good wishes for the future. I was unfortunately not able to be present at last Friday's farewell to you in the Banco Court, which I would have  very much liked to have attended. The unfailing kindness and consideration shown by you to such a junior member of the Bar as myself made my appearances in your court during the past four years occasions to be remembered by me with pleasure. With all my best wishes for long and happy years of retirement, Yours sincerely, John K. McLaughlin.</p>
