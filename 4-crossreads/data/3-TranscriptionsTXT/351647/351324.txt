 funniest thing I've ever seen &amp; George Robey the greatest comedian.  It was a great show.  Tonights the Night at the Gaiety was the daintiest &amp; most finished.  Quite perfect, funny &amp; sweet.  I liked Grossmith. 
 The best individual item was a simple little song, A Broken Doll, at the Vaudeville by a girl named Billie Carleton.  I'd leave my happy home for her all right.  Had a good trip back &amp; they were all glad to see me &amp; reckon I look much better &amp; I feel it too. 
 Things are changed a bit, we are now 2nd Section, 2nd D.A.C., A.I.F., France so a/d that way in future.  I don't like the change but we can't help or alter these things.  Have a new O.C. a nice chap &amp; very decent to me but I liked the former one very well &amp; we knew &amp; suited one another.  However:-  Nice for you to have Stella Wheeler with you &amp; good for Graham too.  How is the scamp.  What a pity the Ellis kid is so delicate.  Hope he improves.  What is Miss McLean like? 
 Now I must flee &amp; to bed as its late &amp; I have to be up early.  My regards to the dear old Boss.  I hope things are good with him &amp; that both Tog &amp; Telleraga are in tip top order &amp; that he has a good shearing.  Hope you're well &amp; that you're not feeling too restless.  Good night, love to Graham &amp; yourself.  Thanks so much for all your niceness. 
 Yours as ever Wilkie
