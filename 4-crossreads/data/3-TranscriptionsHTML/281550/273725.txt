<p><u>December</u></p>
<p>The german who wrote these notices no doubt thought that he was fairly well up in the knowledge of the English Language.</p>
<p>On about the 18th a Frenchman was shot dead by a German sentry just outside my hut. The bullet entered his stomach and passed out halfway down his thigh.</p>
<p>The men who saw him shot said that the German deliberately shot him for nothing at all.</p>
<p>They said that he was just walking along whistling to himself.</p>
<p>He was buried on the 20th. The Germans gave him a decent burial, They had the Band and firing party and buried him with full military honours in the cemetery adjoining the Camp.</p>
<p>On the night of December the 21st we weer officially ordered to get ready to leave Soltau to-morrow the 22nd</p>
