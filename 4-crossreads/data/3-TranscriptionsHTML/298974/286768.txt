<p>3<br/>1 bob per diem, &amp; leaving an allotment to his wife! The other day he took some L.H. pals of his to Barrenjuck in a car, the trip cost him &pound;15; that wasn't done on 1 bob a day? He's very fat and one of the funniest men I've ever met. He wears the 2 S. African ribbons and weighs 17 stone, &amp; t'other day the G.G. beamingly came up to him &amp; asked him who he was in Africa with. He replied, "The Bushman contingent sir" the G.G. laughed &amp; Ossy seeing the joke explained he wasn't so fat then. The other day the O.C. said "You havn't shaved to day Osbourne." "No Sir" he said, "I started to shave and the razor tickled my throat and made me cough, and my cold is awful bad sir!" fancy the hide.</p>
<p>On Sunday we have hired a car to go to Barranjuck. This will be the first time I've been out of camp. The exes are only 35/- each &amp; we go through Yass, a distance of about 50 miles there &amp; 50 back. It ought to be fine. One of the Bartlett boys from Hercules St. C. is here &amp; is a very nice chap. Give my love to the family and tell Hazel not to get excited over details and to be sure and be a little late, its good form</p>
<p>Your loving son<br/>Dene.</p>
