26/7/17 Aveluy
A day of parade ground work. The Battn. formed up as such and did some ceremonial before breaking off to their tasks. The band played. Physical, gas and bayonet drill mostly. A lowering cloudy day. After lunch we had 21 Lewis guns spread out fanwise and put our bombers and rifle bombers through the loading and firing instruction. For a change the gunners did some musketry work and two squads of officers were going ? one under Sutherland in the use of the prismatic compass and one under Thwaites in the Lewis gun. After mess this evening Alderson gave a very good lecture on Mess Etiquette and got home some excellent home thrusts particularly at a few of the younger chaps who have still much to learn. For the first time for a long while recd. today some letters from Australia. Staff Capt. arrived with orders for entrainment tomorrow.
