<p>canal banks. So after talking it over I had to get back into the car and let him drive me back to Cairo again</p>
<p>I had no particular desire to tramp 28 kilometers to Wadan in the dark. with no revolver in my pocket. I had an automatic revolver but it was in my kit bag in the Camp. So I got back to Cairo about 8.30 pm. and had perforce to engage a room at a hotel which cost me another 25 piastres and another 8 piastres for a "Chota hazri' (light breakfast) at 5 AM. I made no mistake about the 6 oclock train. when got back to Camp I handed in the pass and after explaining matters I was let off. but I was sorry that <u>I</u> should be the first one to miss that fatal 5 oclock train although last night several men missed it and there will be a good many more yet. There is no other way of getting to Wadan if one misses that 5 pm train <strike> and from</strike> which I found out at a cost of 228 piastres</p>
