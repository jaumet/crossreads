<p>A Cry from the Wilderness</p>
<p>To Sister Susie</p>
<p>Dear Susie, you&#39;ve lived in Tasmania&#39;s fair isle</p>
<p>Midst peaceful surroundings in nature&#39;s fond smile</p>
<p>Whilst we have been fighting in dust and in heat</p>
<p>Or storming great mountains: The Hun foes to beat.</p>
<p>Of course for the empire you&#39;ve well done your share</p>
<p>Growing apples in Tassy so rosy and rare</p>
<p>Still - I know you&#39;ll relent when you hear me complain</p>
<p>Of the ills you have done us &nbsp;- Here let me explain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple jelly is sweet and was prized by the crowd</p>
<p>Of men over here, and at first they felt proud</p>
<p>That Tasmania had sent it; but changed when they found</p>
<p>They were doomed to endure it, the dreary year&#39;s round.</p>
<p>A poor soul that&#39;s been damned and cast out into space</p>
<p>For ever in darkniss, its lone paths to trace</p>
<p>I blest beside us, if Jones continues to send</p>
<p>Apple Jelly unceasing, till this wicked war&#39;s end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the subs have been sinking our shipping so free</p>
<p>Your apple exporting&#39;s gone all up a tree</p>
<p>But it&#39;s we have to suffer out here in war&#39;s zones</p>
<p>When you send all your apples via Hobart to Jones</p>
<p>Well the cure for al this I can print out to you</p>
<p>Your apples for export - just let the pig&#39;s chew</p>
<p>Dont keep them for jelly. Turn &#39;em all into ham</p>
<p>And in future tell Jones to send changes of jam.</p>
<p>Tpr. Willie.</p>
