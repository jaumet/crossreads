Saturday 25
Left by ferry for Inter Base & after landing had to walk 3 miles carrying full kits to base camp.
This camp is pretty miserable but is situated on a hill with a good view.  There are 3 villages in sight & they look picturesque in the distance.  The sunset over the hills reflected on these collections of stone house made a very nice view.
Food very poor - bread hard biscuits, rice & bully beef stew.
Informed that we move on to Anzac in the morning at 7 oclock.
