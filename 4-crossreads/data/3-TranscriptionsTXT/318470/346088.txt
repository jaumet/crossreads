12-5-17this morning & took some trenches & Bullecourt & are holding position.  15th took 170 odd prisoners & altogether about 300 were taken.  Casualties were rather high & Fritz supposed to have suffered heavily.  Visited Ecourt & Noreuil today - what is left of them?  Came to sunken Rd. near Noreuil in evening to work on deep dugouts.
13thMy party continued to work on Deep Dugouts till 6 oclock this afternoon & then returned to camp.  A lot of shelling by both sides.
14thCame back to Bug St. this afternoon with 17 men to continue work on Dugouts.  About 9 p.m. Jerry started to throw Gas shells over making things very unpleasant.
15-5-17Still working on Deep dugouts.  The shelling last night was very heavy & our casualties in the Front line heavy too.  Fritz attacked & a few of his men got into a portion of our trench but he was repulsed with very heavy loss.  The gas attack last night with shells was the longest on record lasting continuously for 5 hrs. & about 9 hours intermittantly.  It was mostly Tear stuff but at times carried "K stuff".
16thThings were quiet this morning but fairly lively in the afternoon.  Raining.
17thA good deal of Artillery work on both side.  Nothing fresh going.  It is thought that the enemy has gone further back on our Front.  Still employed on Deep dugout work near "Noreuil".
