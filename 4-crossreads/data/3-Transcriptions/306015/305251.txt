<p>up for supper, &amp; then more sleep;  lazy boy!</p>
<p>July 11.   About ten of us missed our breakfast this morning as a result of oversleeping ourselves by an hour, and rising at 9 instead of 8.   Alan  &amp; I warmed a tin of sausages for ourselves, instead, and did the mysterious concoction full justice.  I think that these sausages would be very nice for our next Como picnic.   We salvaged wire in the evening.</p>
<p>July 12.   Early shift again;  wire salvage.   In afternoon we visited the canteen in Pozieres &amp; our booty included Pineapple conserve, biscuits, jam &amp; Custard.   Alan made a dixie-full of custard when we returned.  He also made the jelly which was sent to me from Australia.</p>
<p>July 13.   I was detailed as mess orderly</p>
