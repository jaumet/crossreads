 March, 1915 Friday 19 Saw a Desert Hare today, a whitish grey with Brown ears &amp; a little smaller than our English Hare &ndash; Dogs (pariah) come in from the Desert at night &amp; prowl around our Camp, picking the Refuse pits, all breeds &amp; shapes, &amp; ferocious from starving &ndash; On Reconnaissance today I rode over to what is known as Virgins Tree, the spot where Virgin Mary camped on old Heliopolis  You  would enjoy going to see all these Historical places.
