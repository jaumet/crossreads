<p>Thursday 28 June 1917</p>
<p>Had no mail from AUSTRALIA for a month now &amp; no further ENGLISH news but we must be patient. I enclose with these a collection of snaps not very good but they may interest you. Weather warmer &amp; I'm reducing my KIT to 2 Blankets. Flies in 1000s &amp; the Horses with docked tails &amp; manes are suffering.</p>
<p><strike>The first thing an Englishman does is to cut the tail &amp; mane off.</strike></p>
<p>Post this <strike>with love to all</strike> as tomorrow we will be further away.</p>
