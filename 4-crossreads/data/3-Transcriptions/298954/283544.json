<p>Sat. 10th Nov.<br/>Awoke this morning to find the now quite familiar episodes attendant on a chase by the raider in full swing.</p>
<p>The hatches were closed down, a flutter of excitement on deck above our heads and old Martin was grinding his teeth under my hammock and prophecying in broken English that the quarry was a French mail-boat, armed for and aft and preparing to give the raider and all on board (including us! of course) speedy dissolution!    At 7 am the bulwarks dropped and the prize surrendered without even a stopping shot being necessary.   The rumour immediately went round that a Spaniard loaded with coal had been captured &ndash; this proved to be correct.   At about 8 pm we went on the poop to see the deeply loaded prize waddling along on the port quarter.</p>
<p>She is perhaps the most valuable prize to "Wolf" that the raider has yet caught since the coal problem is now solved for months to come.</p>
