<p>At 7.45 am the Indarra &amp; the rest of the troopships zig zagging at the rate of 17 to 18 knots. The last of the Omrah was seen with her boats full of troops around the ship.<br/>At 10 am sighted a large Deregible at a distance coming towards us from Malta travelling about 60 miles an hour. It rounded &amp; lowered within 100 feet of overhead of the destroyer next to us &amp; semephore &amp; asked the position of the Omrah. Then disappeared in that direction it having a large cage under with 2 guns mounted &amp; 2 propellers distance about &frac12; mile .<br/>At 10.30 am 2 Jap. distroyers came up to us as if from nowhere tearing along at 30 knots to replace the two that remained behind for the Omrah. S.O.S. &amp; position of Omrah received by our wireless &amp; also secret code messages from the Jap. distroyers there.<br/>At noon when relieved on the navigation bridge I asked our wireless if any messages came through re. Omrah (none). At 0.15 pm two destroyers &amp; the dirigible was seen astern coming towards us &amp; making towards Malta. So by apperaiances</p>
