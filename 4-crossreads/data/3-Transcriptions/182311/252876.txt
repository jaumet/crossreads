<p>not damp-proof or shell-proof, then my fighting patrol chased Fritz from N.M.L.&nbsp; New trenches were dug, old ones improved and now we can move from the front line to the B.H.Q. with dry feet, wearing ankle boots.&nbsp; Then we sent over two very successful raids from other battalions, they went through and from our trenches; five prisoners, few casualties, these raids put a full stop to Fritz&#39;s activities and he wouldn&#39;t leave his own wire while we were there.&nbsp; Then he started on us with artillery, but our gunners sent him four for one; then his Trench Mortars, Minenwerfers, (Mine Throwers) started to smash in our trenches, but we located their positions, christened each with a girl&#39;s name my idea and whenever one opened phoned the name to the artillery who promptly dropped a load of ironmongery on the spot.&nbsp; Oh yes, we had Fritz well down by the time we handed over, and it was a nice quiet sector our opporite battalion, the 40th took from us . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; These weeks have been busy ones for me, for during the first tour I acted as Scout Officer and the Second Intelligence and Scouting together while out for the seven days a busy time training the Scouts.&nbsp; Now I&#39;ve got time to write and a pile of 44 letters to answer almost affrights me for in that three weeks we have had four Australian mails and parcels too, why I&#39;ve had five in a fortnight and they have provided cigarettes and suppers galore.&nbsp; We are pleased to think that Christmas will be spent away from the line and look forward to a celebration with reminiscences of our last</p>
