  
 Wednesday 2 [1] May 1917 [1918] 11 a.m. comes C. Murphy & takes yet another swab of my luckless throat & if neg. I may go. Miss Warrel visits me & talks as usual of her age which worries her evidently. Choubra holds a reception 1st Wed. in every month & Miss Oram graced the building today. My kites fly down for chicken bones every lunch hour & my pet sparrows come at 5.15 a.m. for crumbs. Met the O.C. on the entrance & had a friendly talk, am glad as fear my behaviour thus far has been churlish in the extreme but it is two nervous people meeting. Met C. Spencer also & redeemed my behaviour too I hope. F.E.H. is not a success as a pt. - that I now know.
