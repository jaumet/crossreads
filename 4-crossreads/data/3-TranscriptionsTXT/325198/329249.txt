 20 February, 1916 Maadi I sealed church this morning, cracked sick, was in the unfortunate position of not having the cash to buy Boot polish &amp; did not like to go dirty or be a hum on my mates so stayed &amp; did some writing in stead.  Played a game of footer this afternoon &amp; was on the losing side. to night I met perkie &amp; we took a bit of a walk &amp; had a decent chat.  Got a letter from Bert this morning, he say he will be in Cairo next Sunday so there is a prospect of me seeing him. I hope I do, perkie is going to try &amp; get leave also.
