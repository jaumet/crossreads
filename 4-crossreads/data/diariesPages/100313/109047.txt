11/1/18 Oxford
Heavy rain was falling early but cleared off before breakfast. Walked down through the old walks to Meadow Fields and skirted a canal before reaching the main stream of the Thames ? here called the Isis. Moored here are many old barges bearing arms of the different colleges. The river is tranquil and straight and boathouses are on its banks. The course seems ideal for rowing. Although bare and gaunt owing to winter the many trees were very pretty and in Springtime these walks must be charming. Returned to the Town, first taking a look back at its many towers and spires. To Christ Church College where there is a tall old tower called Tom's Tower opening into a large quiet secluded quadrangle. Through two little arches into Christ Church
