<p>O.C. of the Imperial Cooking school at Jellalabad Barracks at Tedworth came along &amp; took me in his motor to the school, put me in the hands of a S.S.M. and showed me how the ovens etc. were to be built and I am to see that they are built the same.  This is a soft cop for me.<br/>Tedworth is a one eyed village of two or three streets and seems to be nothing but barracks all with indian names. Putra, Lucknow, Allaharabad etc.</p>
