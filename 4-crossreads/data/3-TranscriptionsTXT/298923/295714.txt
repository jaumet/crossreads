17 February 1918 SundayWe have been issued with STEEL HELMETS & the boys chaff each other by calling out "Have you seen the ""Orsetralians about chum" pretending they are Tommies.Moved on another 15 miles over stony rises along the old Turkish railway Joppa-Jerusalem- now in good order again-We captured many engines & much rolling stocks last STUNT.Camped at Zacheriyeh along lime stone hills & Caves-   On the march I noticed many Cyclamen in bloom, the same mauve color as glass at Carrakoorte.Did not Zachereyih live in a tree here!!! Somewhere?
