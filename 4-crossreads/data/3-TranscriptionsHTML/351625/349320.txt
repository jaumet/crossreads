<p>long away from it.  I had a letter from Ken a few days ago, he seems to be doing well, he will make a good officer, you will think I have slipped some him beating me but I havent, you know everyone hasent the same luck.  They are just waiting for this letter so I will have to say au revoir, best love &amp; kisses to all</p>
<p>From your loving son<br/>Douglas</p>
