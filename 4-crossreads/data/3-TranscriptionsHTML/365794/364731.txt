<p>Friday 23 November 1917<br/>In Maxwell till 9.30 a.m. then Kitchener till 2 p.m., off 2-5, then Maxwell 5-8.  Nothing but wounds &amp; dressings all day &amp; such patient men.  One case practically whole of lower jaw &amp; part mouth shot away &ndash; man so quiet &amp; cheerful.  1 pt. told me how a wounded Turk had a few days previously implored the men, our soldiers, to lend him a razor to cut his throat, he had fallen off a lorry &amp; lying by the roadside.  Our fellows gave the razor &amp; watched him cut his throat!! &amp; the man told me as though it were the most ordinary occurrence.</p>
