where we are camping.  Great aerial activity immediately after fog lifted.
Thursday 23.11.16Fatigues at A.D.S.   Again foggy.  Fritz shelled heavily within a few hundred yards of us & caught an A.S.C. depot.
Friday 24.11.16Cold & windy.  Left camp about 1 pm to take up posts on line. Working out from Delville wood & Le Beoufs.  Quite a route march to farthest post which I was unfortunate enough to strike.  Fritz shelled us on the way out & again shelled heavily at about 8 pm.  Very long distance to carry, but going much better than on the other front we worked a few weeks back.
