  
 we lost poor Capt. Brown.  He was killed by a shell explosion at Motor Car Corner.  He was very highly respected & his loss was very keenly felt by the Batt.  He was buried in Tancred Farm Cemetry. Some little excitement was caused by an attack on one of our baloons & one of Fritz's planes appeared to be hit.  It came down very low but I believe reached his lines. I have reason to think I shall shortly be moved form the Bde.  It seems the Anglicans are going to put a man with this Bde. & in the 35th Bn. 
 Sunday My service this morning was better & again with the Engineers very good.  The weather has been very good & the Lilac & flowers are blooming beautifully.  Our men went into the Trenches tonight to the Supports. 
 Monday May 21st I went up to the 36th H.Q. in the line, had lunch and then went to see the boys in A Corp.
