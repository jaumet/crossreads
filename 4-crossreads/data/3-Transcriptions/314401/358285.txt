<p>beach &amp; sailed round us, with Hip Hip hooray in Gallic fashion &amp; Kiss L'Angleterre". They had learnt to say "Keep the flag flying". They clapped &amp; cheered, but as usual we took not the slightest notice. I must confess it was very nice to look on pretty women's faces. We have hardly seen any since June, for when we were in Sydney three weeks ago we were too absorbed &amp; hurried to notice anyone. These who are passing us now are quite far enough away to make it quite safe to look at them. I have just heard that one of the troopships either the Monowai or the Moeraki has gone ashore in the harbour which means that we may have to wait for the next tide to lift her, but we shall soon know. We had a most impressive sight just now. The Montcalm returning from calibration crossed our bows with every man at attention &amp; her band playing "God Save the King". But she is a funny looking ship like this. [Transcriber's note: Simple diagram of a naval vessel has been drawn]<br/>The troopship is aground &amp; her name is the Manganni, I was mistaken in calling her the Monrovia. I am bringing a plan of Noumea with me &amp; I will show you where she was. At any rate she cannot get off until 8.30 tonight. This afternoon permission was given to one third of the officers to go ashore. I did not go, preferring to go ashore at Fiji. When they came back they told me I hadn't missed much. It is Sunday morning now &amp; everything is ready.   <strike>Manganni</strike> Monowai, after all is off &amp; no damage done. The ships are moving off in a grand procession. Pyramus &amp; Psyche first then the troopships followed by the Philomel. Then come Melbourne, Montcalm &amp; last of all ourselves at intervals of twenty minutes. All goes well until it is the turn of the Montcalm. She is inside the harbour &amp; we guess she has either fouled her anchor or hasn't room to manoeuvre. The leading ships are well out of sight &amp; so we go on leaving the Montcalm to come on when she was ready. There is a curious natural canal between the reefs from the open sea to Noumea, ten miles long. We are to traverse that, and then wait for each other &amp; reform. We wait a little while &amp; the Montcalm comes panting up, &amp; we take line astern, flagship leading. The night is dark &amp; cloudy, and it is most impressive to dimly perceive a distinct outlines of the ships behind us, throwing up dense clouds   <strike>of</strike> . </p>
