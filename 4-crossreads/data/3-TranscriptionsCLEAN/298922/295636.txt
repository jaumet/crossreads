  
 Monday 3 December 1917 
 This is an old ship built 22 years ago & RATS & ANTS are plentiful now that the warmer weather is here. Many of the P. & O. are in use as Hospital boats, Despatch Boats & some are armed as auxiliary cruisers. 
 About 4 p.m. we got a S.O.S. wireless from a submarined boat north of us, but we did not alter our course as the Navy attend to that. Rough again  & the little wife did not sleep.
