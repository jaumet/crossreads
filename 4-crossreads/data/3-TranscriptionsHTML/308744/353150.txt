<p>Later the same day three of our machines bombed KASTAK Railway Station with good effect. The same day AMMAN Station and Aerodrome were bombed by machines from other Squadrons. Altogether five raids were carried out. An entry in the German Flying Corps diary referring to these raids states:- "On the 21st AMMAN was attacked with bombs five times. Two machines of 305 Squadron and one of the Turkish Squadron was strongly damaged, and several men were killed and wounded."</p>
<p>On the same day Lieut, E.S. Headlam (pilot) and Lieut. W.H. Lilly (observer) drove an enemy two-seater down near the AMMAN Aerodrome.</p>
<p>The 22nd is a red-letter day in the history of the unit, being the date upon which the Squadron claimed its first enemy machine shot down in our lines. In all previous cases, even when the combat commenced our territory, the end came behind the enemy's lines. On this occasion the two Bristol Fighters, Pilots: Capt. A.R. Brown and Lieut. J.M. Walker Observers: Lieut. G. Finlay and H.A. Letch M.C., were patrolling our line when an enemy two-seater appeared over RAMLEH at a height of 17,000 feet. They attacked the enemy machine, and in the fight that ensued immediately over our aerodrome, one of our machines was shot down out of control, and both the occupants, Lieuts. J.M. Walker and M.A. Letch M.C. were killed. The other machine carried on the combat and a few minutes later drove the enemy machine down in our lines. The enemy Pilot and Observer were uninjured and were taken prisoners. There were several bullet machines in their machine and engine. One bullet passed through the enemy pilot's glove, and three others through a map board that the observer had on his knees. For this work Capt. Brown and Lieut, Finley were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.</p>
<p>The 24th August is notable for the great aerial battle fought on the front. Taking off in response to a hostile aircraft alarm, Lieuts G.C. Peters and P.J. McGinness, D.C.M. (pilots0 and J.H. Traill and H.B. Fletcher (observers) met an enemy two-seater at 11,000 feet over JELIL. As our machine approached the enemy machine turned Westwards and fired a signal light. Shortly afterwards our machine found that they had been led under a formation of 6 scouts which were about 3,000 feet above, having come in from the coast[.] The leader of this formation fired a light and then dived on our machines followed by the others. By smart manoeuvring our machines evaded the onslaught, and got above the enemy machines. In the combat that ensued the enemy two-seater was crashed, one scout was sent down in flames, two others were shot down and destroyed, while a four[th] was forced down on to a road where it collided with a motor lorry and crashed badly. It was ascertained from enemy records that of the seven enemy machines engaged in this combat, only one scout got back to its aerodrome. The four officers named above were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for this performance and were personally congratulated by the General Officer Commanding, Royal Air Force, (Middle East), upon their 'brilliant achievement.'</p>
<p>On the 27th the JENIN Aerodrome was vigorously attacked by Lieut. S.A. Nunan (pilot) and Lieut. F.C. Conrick (observer). When approaching the enemy aerodrome seven scouts and 1 two-seater were observed on the ground. Our machine patrolled immediately over the aerodrome at a few thousand feet for about an hour, and as none of the enemy machines showed any inclination to come into the air, Lieut. Nunan went down to a lower altitude and he and his Observer proceeded to machine gun the machines and hangars. Men were seen to run away from the enemy machines as the Bristol Fighter approached. 500 rounds were fired at this target and traces were seen to enter the machines and hangars.</p>
<p>On the 29th a Handly Page machine '09681' recently flown from ENGLAND to EGYPT by General A.E. Borton, D.S.O. was taken on the strength of the Squadron. This was the first of this type of machine to arrive on the front.</p>
<p>Two enemy two-seaters were destroyed in aerial combat on the 31st by Lieut. P.J. McGinness, D.F.C., D.C.M. (pilot) AND Lieut. H. Fysh (observer). Both the enemy machines were shot down by the 'rear guns' one crashing in our lines. For this Lieut. Fysh was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.</p>
