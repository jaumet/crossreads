<p>France<br/>6/1/19</p>
<p>My Dear All<br/> We have received a letter from home dated 3/11/18 and by jove you were excited about peace goodness only knows what the next will say. Ah well it means a lot to us too, we have been in France two months but we shall soon be leaving here for England  again. I told you Harry and I wrote to Billy Hughes to try and get home at once. Well we received our reply to-day also some</p>
