<p>The wharf shed was a mass of flags and flowers, &amp; we breakfasted to the strains of a bagpipe band (surely a unique breakfast "orchestra"?), the meal being interrupted by Lord Mayors etc making speeches of welcome.</p>
<p>After breakfast we expected to slip quietly away to London, but got the shock of our lives.</p>
<p>The "Ficaria's" passengers were breakfasted before the "Primula" people landed and we then went to the exit &ndash; to be assisted on to one of a string of motor lorries draped with flags to resemble movable pedestals.   Ted's gorgeous uniform caused him to be pushed to the front seat of state, I sat modestly behind.</p>
<p>Ted was known evidently, &amp; as the huge line of lorries drew away a little two very smart warrant-officers and a lieut. came over and congratulated him &ndash; and me, then.    Then the procession started &ndash; and the fun began.   A triumphal arch with "Welcome Home" in huge letters barred the dock gates &ndash; swinging into the town (we were near the head of the procession) a hoarse cheer went up</p>
