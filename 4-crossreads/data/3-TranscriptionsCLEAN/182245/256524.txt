 JANUARY  1917 
 9 TUESDAY  
 Dull & misty rain all day & very  
 cold. Took the horses out for 
 exercise in the morning and 
 grooming all the afternoon. 
 there was a big bombardment 
 going all day at the front. 
 Saw little bunches of wooden 
 crosses hanging on trees 
 along the road. The French 
 peasants make them & anybody 
 killed near there they have 
 a cross handy to put on 
 his grave.
