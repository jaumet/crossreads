The wounded men were helped along by their comrades.
We shifted further towards the line to a village called Caulx and we did not camp in the village itself for a few nights, but out on an open field where it was raining nearly all the time. Later on we explored the village and found quarters in an old chateau which the Germans evidently had not time to wreck, as they systematically wrecked all standing property in the villages as they retreated. They even left the remains of a dead horse in the yard of the place we camped in, and by the way the animal was cut about, we could see that they (the Germans) must have been short of meat for their rations. From this place we did fatigues up to the front line for about a week and took up outpost duty in front of a village called Longat. The food had to be carried to us in this out-post near Longat, and the consequence was that the Germans observed the position in which we had the post. From the time the Germans observed this we were shelled very heavily at intervals for the remainder of the time in which we stayed there, which was about 10 days. From the position we were in, we could see a tank to the right of Bullecourt, and we came to the conclusion that a sniper was hidden in it. We of course informed the artillery information Officer who directed his battery on to the correct range, the consequence of which, the tank was blown to pieces after several direct hits. We saw the whole village of Bullecourt, which was occupied by the Germans, razed to the ground by the artillery fire in the course of 5 days continuous bombarding. It was a marvellous sight to see great clouds of bricks and sheets of iron roofing bursting up into the air continually.
We moved back from this out-post in front of Bullecourt to a village named Faverail, and where we camped in tents, the scarcity of tents being so great as to warrant our Colonel putting as many as 22 in each tent. It was raining heavily and the ground was sodden and in spite of the fact that we were sitting up all night on our waterproof sheets, we were wet through. The reason we marched back to this Camp was that we were to prepare for a stunt which was to come off in a few weeks hence;
