longing for the Sunny South & our own girls.I have been writing todays doings in the big hall of the Royal Sailors Rest in Devonport, & as I now write a chap is singing "I'll sing thee songs of Araby".  This is a fine place for every night they have good music & plenty of it & songs scattered in between.  The place is large enough to seat a couple of thousand people & it is always well patronized by sailors & soldiers.  Attached to it are restaurants, billiard rooms, reading & writing rooms, plenty of good hot baths, a thousand cubicles for sleeping purposes, hair dressing saloons & goodness only knows what else.  It was started by Miss Agnes Weston 60 years ago & she died only a few weeks ago.  I went to her funeral.  Among the sailors for whom she worked principally she was known as Aggie Weston & she was held in great affection by them, she practically devoted her whole life time to their interests & the work she started so humbly has now grown to an immense undertaking.
