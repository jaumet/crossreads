 Saturday 17 November 1917 Reported to Home sister 7.45 a.m. &amp; sent to "Maxwell" for day? Took temps., did dressings till 1 p.m., off 2-5.  Went to 14 A.G.H., 4 p.m. tea with Cobbie, then D.3 &amp; found Dick Rutledge, a pt. with injury to leg, looking so gay &amp; well. Evening duty, dressings etc.  Major Farrant operates for this ward &amp; interviews us re dressing of wounds, etc.  Capt. Mitchell is M.O. for ward.  Capt. Grant called &amp; accused me of running away from "Connaught".  Can one wonder? Gradually we settle down to our new life but to me it is very lonely &amp; always a longing for a real friend worries me (spoilt I fancy).  Weather cooler already.  Three weeks here today &amp; I am the last on duty.  30 English sisters on after the A.A.N.S. &amp; now F.E.H.
