<p>midnight, I found the whole place taken up with Tommies going back to France from their leave &amp; dozens of girls were there seeing them off singing &amp; dancing all the time, they were kicking up a great row, while waiting here great trainloads of Yanks kept on coming through they were just off the ships &amp; I was the first Australian they had ever seen so they were greatly interested in me &amp; my uniform  they have been hearing a good bit about the Aussies since the Yanks made that attack with our chaps &amp; they think the Australians are <u>the</u> fighters  they fairly crowded round me as if I was a piece of curiosity &amp; the questions they asked it was very amusing to me, but they are a fine lot of chaps no mistake</p>
