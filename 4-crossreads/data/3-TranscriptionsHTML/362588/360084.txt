<p>Judge Ferguson</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Will you please have names shown on this letter added to your list.  Mr. Gray suggests the presenting of "Colours" to the 20th on our returns;  <u>from the people of Albury</u>.  Will you get in touch with him please?</p>
<p>Your son is in excellent health &amp; has greatly improved as a leader.  He should get another star shortly.  I have already recommended it.  Col. Lamrock is sick in Cairo &amp; may not rejoin us.  Major Jenkins is in command (temporary) &amp; I am 2nd in command (temporary).  We are at Lemnos &amp; should be in the trenches within 24 hours.  So far our men are in fine form &amp; all anxious to fight.</p>
<p>Sincerely yrs.<br/>R.F. Fitzgerald<br/>20.8.15</p>
