<p>morning, we eventually gaining our objective &ndash; 150 yds and trench.  We assisted as much as possible.  It was a glorious sight and heroism and grit displayed by our boys baffles description.</p>
<p>28th July  1916  Relieved this morning and went back amongst the Artillery.  Glad to get out of the trenches where the strain is awful.  Position as we found it.  Things were a big mixed all right.</p>
<p>29th July  1916  Still in reserves and carrying rations and rum to firing line.</p>
<p>30th July  1916  Moved up to supports where we do indirect fire.  An Officer captured at Pozieres said that our machine Gun fire did more damage than Artillery.  We are enfilading a main sap.  Some of each Brigade charged to-night, but the Artillery failing to cut the wire failed though the German line was entered at several points.</p>
<p>31st July  1916  Still in supports and being very much worried with gas and lachrymatory shells.</p>
<p>1st August  1916  Relieved again and backed into Reserves.  Harry Austin and Plume and Hearst caught the full force of a gas shell.  Afterwards all died.</p>
<p>2nd August  1916  Supplying fatigues again.  Our Brigade has done marvellous work and badly needs a rest which won't be until we take the Ridge in front away.</p>
<p>3rd August 1916  Up in front line again.  Fritz is shelling like blazes.  One of our guns buried and Sgt Tate killed, two others had to go out with shell shock.  Rotten night.</p>
<p>4th August 1916  2nd Anniversary of the War and we hopped the parapet to-night.  Our Artillery has been going all day and cut all the wire in front to bits.  Barrage started at 9.15 and lifted 9.18, when 18 and 20 and some of the Company Brigades went over.  One of our guns went.</p>
<p>5th August 1916 Morning found us in possession of two more lines of German trenches and our chaps running about looking for Fritz.  Resistance only slight.  Fritz is pouring in shells like hell.  Three of our boys wounded in charge.</p>
