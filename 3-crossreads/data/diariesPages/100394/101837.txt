We will probably be moving away again tonight. Our boys were terribly cut up in the last charge and hundreds of dead and wounded are lying between the trenches but are being collected today. I will be glad to leave as the place holds nasty associations. The Germans flooded our boys out of the trenches as soon as they took them and had no ammunition in any case. We got away from Camp about dark and came on to Gris Pot Posted letter home and to Moll.

I am on duty today at the Headquarters of the Battalion whom we are to support. Wye Farm it is called about 2 miles from the Battery. We haven’t fired a shot here so far and are moving back again to our last position tomorrow. They won’t allow us to get settled in one place more than a day or so and consequently we can’t make ourselves comfortable and our rations are messed about Bombardier Prior left us today for H.Qs. and has been relieved by Bombardier Connors

Have been on duty on telephone all day at Wye Farm and expect to be on until we move off sometime tonight. The Tommies left any amount of tucker behind them. They are much better catered for than we are I don’t know why. Our troops are awfully badly fed and clothed. The 56th Battalion are stationed here at present We got away from Wye Farm about 9 p.m. and went round to the Battery and we all came round into Camp near Fleurbaix again.

This morning Capt Prior sent 24 Gunners and 3 spooks back to the Horse lines for a weeks spell. I was one of the Spooks. We have nothing to do at all so we will have a good rest and plenty of tucker. It will give me plenty of time to write letters anyhow. I have had two from Dorrie lately and wrote to, Tom.
