Mrs. Deery has won for herself a good name, but in all probability there was in her home not strict enough discipline, which must at all times insist upon a correct line of action in the affairs personal and public of each moment.  Kelty, Kirkland, and others have chosen a first-class ship in which to travel to  Adelaide  Tasmania.  Mr. Andersons paper has not yet come.
