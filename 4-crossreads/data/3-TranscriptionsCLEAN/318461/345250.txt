  
 building with a Bell Tower & on top a statue of the Virgin & child weighing 6 tons this was hit at the base & fell overhanging the street an awesome sight to walk under, its about 300 feet from the ground. It was secured in its Present Position by Aux Engineers. but in my opinion will come down one of these days the strain on the Brick work being awful . Saw some women & children first for about 31/2 months also shops etc, some of the people have chanced it & come back again but they have a look about them that is not pleasant & no wonder. Got home again about 8.15. Bombardment still going on.
