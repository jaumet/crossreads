<p>I left off writing this on Sunday and have just been reading it over again - My word I had a bad attack that afternoon alright, must have been very sentimental, suppose it was intergestion, but I&#39;ll let it go - only I must take back a couple of lies I put in it. First one was - it was not an olive tree I was sitting under; it was a fig, but all the trees round were olives and I did not notice till afterwards that the one I was under was not. 2ns - It is all rot to say that the melons were in tropical profusion, because there were not any palms or rushes to make it look a bit tropical; but it was all very thick and was say - a mass of matted greenry - which sounds well</p>
