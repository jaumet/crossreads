  
 23 January 1916 Sun Being the Sabbath - church held on the desert very hot. Visions of large glasses of beer & ginger ale. Had the afternoon off which was spent playing bluff poker lost as usual. Letter from Harry Fay received. Wrote to Joyce Walters. Bellemey very dry. 
 24 January 1916 Mon Stretcher-drill all the morning. Enough to break a man's heart trudging through the sand. Route march in the afternoon to the old trenches of Tel-el-Kebir. Short lecture by Major Moseley & Captain Frizell. Went to the canteen with two-speed Murphy who shouted two bottles of beer. Wrote to Maude Griffiths & Joyce Ross.
