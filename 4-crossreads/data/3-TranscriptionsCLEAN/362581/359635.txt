My dearest Eddy.
It was my birthday a few days ago   &  spent a very quiet day. Hope to be with You all next year. It is becoming colder now   &  had a lot of rain, think may try to get out of France for this Winter. How do you like school? I shall hardly know my little nephew when I return. Fondest love  &  kisses  From Auntie Eadle  XXXXXX
