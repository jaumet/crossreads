Tel el Kebir, Egypt4.1.16My dearest Sister,As you will notice by the heading I am again in the desert land, this time as far away from Cairo as they can get us & only a native village near by. The name is no doubt familiar to you on account of the battle of "Tel-el-Kebir" which Wolsely fought with the arabs here in the "eighties". The only thing of interest at all is the graveyard where the British troops were buried & that is a pretty gloomy thing to go sight seeing.I received a couple of letters from you & some more from the rest of the family yesterday, which has been waiting for us for a few weeks, your "overflow" parcel turned up alright & will
