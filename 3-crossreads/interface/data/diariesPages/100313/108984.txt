5/12/17 Mt. Kemmell
Rode to D.H.Q. to a conference of C.O.'s and G.O.Cs all the heads being there gathered together. Major General Smythe presided discussed many matters arising out of the campaign and our experiences. Rode on into Bailleul with Brazenor and dined at the Officer's Club there. The roads were slippery and smooth. Returned to our place and saw the last half of an excellent football match between ourselves and the 23rd, which the latter won. Afterwards we entertained 18 of their officers to mess, Cutler, our cook excelling himself and turning out a good meal. Habel the mess corporal is a good manager. After mess we had a bridge tournament and badly beat them at it. Altogether a very interesting evening and one of which I hope we shall have more as it brings the officers together and lets them exchange views about their work c.
