outside the village, some go right over to Bailleul.      Did up several papers etc to post home.
Wednesday 20th March   A little rain again, did nothing myself but the new orderly officer put a few men to work on the revetting so apparently he is going to run it himself in the future especially now that there are three General Duty Sgts available.  Did a little reading & writing & sent some papers home.  Fritz shelling all round us & we have had several casualties in.   The line is much more active now and our planes appear to have the air well in hand.   We have been warned that Fritz is sending over large gas shells up to 9 inch & the heads apparently expect much from him in that respect.   Gas drill now on every day.   Fritz was over bombing last night but did not hit the village.   The people here (Dranoutre) rather a good class lot & speak perfect English altho' many cannot speak French.   There are many 1914 graves in the place.
