<p>[The beginning of this letter appears to be missing.]<br/>shrapnel bullets &amp; fuze caps of shells.  Not a few dead 'uns also but they are mostly <u>very</u> dead, "a rag &amp; a bone &amp; hank of hair" so to speak.</p>
<p>I am living at the wagon lines, its much more convenient for me &amp; they haven't room for me forward.  I have a bonzer dugout &amp; really am more comfortable than I have been since enlisting.  With this new job I am not so tied down, can get out &amp; roam round &amp; am not glued to the office like I used to be.  My appointed as Sergeant is now confirmed so I'm Acting no long but there's really no difference.</p>
<p>We had the thaw but it wasn't so disastrous as we feared.  Very little rain thank heaven so the place wasn't the sea of deep &amp; liquid mud it might have been.  In places it was bad enough but nothing near like the autumn &amp; it is drying up very well.  The spring is in the air &amp; really it is a most delicious feeling.  Even I, old hoss that I am, can feel it &amp; you can notice it</p>
