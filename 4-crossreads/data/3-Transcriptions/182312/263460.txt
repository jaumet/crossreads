<p>once a week are another good idea and in addition to reducing our meat</p>
<p>requirements by a seventh will probably do our constitution no little</p>
<p>good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is the question of the cultivation of the British</p>
<p>Isles.&nbsp; Thousands of acres are lying idle which should long ago have</p>
<p>been put to use.&nbsp; The Farmers say that they cannot secure sufficient</p>
<p>labour.&nbsp; Then it must be found for them.&nbsp; France is densely cultivated</p>
<p>not an acre being wasted and this with EVERY MAN of military age at war</p>
<p>or war work.&nbsp; Who then does the farming?&nbsp; The women, the children and the old men and they will have to do it in the British Isles.&nbsp; In</p>
<p>France they do it with a will for the love of France and I trust that</p>
<p>in Britain they will not have to be conscripted.&nbsp; There are any amount</p>
<p>of women of the leisure class who could be put to this work with benefit</p>
<p>both to the country and to themselves, whilst the supply of child labour</p>
<p>and elderly peiple in the immidiate vicinity of where the work requires</p>
<p>doing, must be considerable.&nbsp; There is in England at present a section</p>
<p>of women who treat war work as a sort of Society fad.&nbsp; Just at present</p>
<p>farm work is the fashion.&nbsp; They get an elaborate farming costume made</p>
<p>in Bond Street in which they have their photograph taken standing along-</p>
<p>side (not <u>too</u> close) a nicely groomed tame cow borrowed for the</p>
<p>occasion.&nbsp; The next step is to have the photo with suitable letter press</p>
<p>inserted in&quot;The Tattler&quot; whereupon their joy is complete and the lap</p>
<p>dog gets an extra lump of sugar that night.&nbsp; On the other hand there</p>
<p>are thousands of women willing and anxious to do any work which may be</p>
<p>of use - anything so long as they can feel that they are helping.&nbsp; All</p>
<p>it wants is someone to organise womens labour, show them exactly what</p>
<p>wants doing and they will do it.&nbsp; So far no attempt seems to have</p>
<p>been made to organise this voluntary labour and it is a matter which</p>
<p>wants attending to at once.&nbsp; The British woman is no sluggard, give</p>
<p>her a job and she will master it in no time;&nbsp; this much she has proved</p>
