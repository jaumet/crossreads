<p>Dear Mrs Waterhouse,</p>
<p>I saw your son, Lieut.  Walter Waterhouse this morning in the Wandsworth Hospital, where he is recovering from wounds received in France. He is in good spirits and is getting on well.</p>
<p>His brother, who is convalescent, was visiting him at the time. I though you would be glad to know that both are doing well.</p>
<p>I had a letter from the Rev. R.C. Oakley from France, yesterday, and am pleased to be able to tell you that he is in good health, in spite of the severe weather they are having there. He is also doing well in his Chaplaincy work.</p>
<p>Your younger son, is going to 'light duties in England' for the present. Lieut.  Traeloar, who is just leaving same Hospital, wishes to be remembered to you and your family.</p>
<p>I wish you a Happy New Year.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>James  Green<br/>S.C.F<br/>(Methodist)</p>
