  
 25th Same as yesterday. Dammed cold. Fritz makes thing lively about noon sending some big shells fairly close- apart from that everything was quiet. 26th Cold & bleak. Artillery fairly active. Nothing much doing. 27th I was awakened about 4 am & I was very forcibly reminded of July 29th last. Same bombardment was in progress. Fritz's lines were shelled continuously for 2 hours. A charge was made which resulted in many prisoners being taken. This was done by Welsh Fusiliers of the famous 29th (Gallipoli) Division.
