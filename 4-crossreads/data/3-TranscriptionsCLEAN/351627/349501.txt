Christmas was very quiet here, we each received a billy containing delicacies, chief of which were the old plum puddings which we all enjoyed thoroughly. We had a heavy shower Christmas night & another on Boxing night which made things rather uncomfortable as we have no tents.
Last night was not too pleasant it was cloudy with a very cold wind blowing & as I was on outpost I felt the cold more than I have fore some time.
I have had great accounts of Artie's wedding from home. some time ago Mother said she sent me a paper with the account in but I have not received it yet. I have written to Artie congratulating him.
Well Aunty as I can think of nothing more at present, I will close.
