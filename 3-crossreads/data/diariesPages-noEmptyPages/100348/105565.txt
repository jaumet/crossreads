Received another issue of army tobacco it is of very fair quality this time. 
Washed clothes at the Laundry then went to the Tommies camp and had a "Russian Bath" in their steam house. It was a treat, the best bath I have had for a long time. I think it is a good omen, that we will not loiter here much longer. Futter has arrived from Egypt with artillery details. A letter form Sep, from El Alamien.

Got a good job as Divisional Orderly went on duty to Etaples after being paid 20 francs. Spent the afternoon there. Fell foul of "Charlie" the Sergt.Major; we clapped bills and he wanted to put me in the "clink"; came the old soldier stunt of complaining to the adjutant.
