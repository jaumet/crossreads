<p>ambulance but it was an orphan.  To go out at 8.45 with Walsh.  Got party of 20 at usual meeting place and working near hedge in front of old billets.  Very slow but good workers from 6th I think.  Some shelling on right front and left.  Home feeling very tired and giddy at times.</p>
<p>15.5.18<br/>Slept all day and not feeling at all well.  Temp. 102.2 and in evening saw Major at F.A. [Field Ambulance] who gave me no duty.  P.U.O [placed under observation] and many piles.  Can't eat and heavy pains in head like influenza.  Fine &amp; warm.</p>
<p>16.5.18<br/>Restless night.  Saw Hayward at 11.  Stayed in bed rest of day after shaving and a wash before side parade.  Can't eat anything.  In evening very clear and two planes over and saw transport ready to move up long before dark.  A good few shells came over about 9 and a number of shrapnel.  One dud in next billet No. 1.  Most fell in back but some quite close and everyone went over to shelter of church except Burkitt, Sidman, myself.  Pretty warm on job according to accounts.  Slept alright at 1 after reading magazines.  Very warm and fine.</p>
<p>17.5.18<br/>Fine &amp; hazy.  Stayed in all day.  Pains in back otherwise not bad.  Edmonds came back in afternoon.  Also Dola &amp; some others.  Quiet.  Everyone in this floor cleared out to more congenial billets headed by Linton and Carter.  Slept all right.</p>
