<p>are very muddy today.<br/>I was called up to the Orderly Room today to sign a paper in connection with leave. I am to go to Blighty on or before the 13th of this month.<br/>With Bill Wilson I went to the 21 Battalion camp to see his brother George but he was in the lines. He had some rum which was issued to his mates in his hut. There is a rumour afloat that we are to go to Egypt before the winter is over This rumour has been afloat a long time &amp; is very persistent. It looks as if the authorities expect the war to end this winter &amp; we would be that much nearer home &amp; in the event of the war continuing we could be easily sent to Italy or Mesopotamia.</p>
