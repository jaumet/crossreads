<p>Tuesday 2 October 1917<br/>Very hot days now and the sea like glass, lovely sunsets and full moon.<br/>Sisters sleeping on deck.  "Ayrshire" paper contains full acct. of fancy dress dinner.<br/>Evening given to Book evening.  F.E.H. went as I.O.U., guessed at once.  Nothing very original and most told to particular friends without any guessing.  I, being on the straight, got 10 only.  Read "The Snare", Breath of the Dragon, both good.<br/>Plenty of snaps taken of fancy attire.</p>
