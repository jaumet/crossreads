<p>467<br/>For a discharge out of the service &ndash;I believe if I got to Australia they would accept me there &ndash; However I will be able to let you know my plans more definitely by next mail.</p>
<p>I espect to leave te hospital on the 24th and stay with Aunt Isabel till the Monday.  the White Waters have the girls and myself to Wildwood on Boxing Day. They are having a riding party &ndash; I shall be horribly afraid of my riding pants bursting as I have put on so much condition.</p>
<p>The girls forwarded me on a letter from Betina, she seems to be doing wonderfully well, but rather depressed as some of the doctors she liked have left Lemnos  - Dr Jamison is in London I think, if he is I look forward to seeing him &ndash; The girls came up last Sunday</p>
