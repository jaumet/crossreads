  
 London & Ludgershall 
 13/9/16 Attended the mounting of the guard at St James and did some shopping thereafter returning to hotel for lunch.  Took taxi to Waterloo Station getting a fine view of the city from the bridge. Left at 1pm for Ludgershall (Perim Downs Wiltshire) travelling down with Davis and others.  Reported at Camp and allotted a good room in a hut. 
 14/9/16 Still here on Perim Downs - a fine but very cold day with a piercing wind.  Winter here must be awful.  Walked into Ludgershall a couple of times and poked around camp bored to extinction and imbibed whisky and sodas.  Disgusting to see the cold footers hanging round here swanking it over everyone. Men who have been sent here from their regiments for acts of cowardice and unfitness for command instead of being branded as such and put in a special camp and stripped of uniform are allowed to hang round on training jobs posing as Lords of Creation. 
 15/9/16 Received orders before lunch to report to Rollestone to join a draft for France and the Commandant lent Major Currie and I his motorcar.  We had a very pleasant spin over the chalky plain now so thickly populated with military and pulled into camp & received orders to take 960 men over to France with us leaving here at 2.30 am.  Having duly dumped them at the "Bullring" at Etaples  we hope to get a clear run right through to Ypres.  Very good mess dinner tonight -wine cigars and full menu and the staff capt. said their exceptional mess man runs it on 2/- per diem.  An English major at dinner relating at great length to an M.O on his unfitness owing to shell shock some time ago but shrewdly pumping the doctor to find out the reasons for tapping knee re for reflex; and so on with other questions really I fancy just to find out how to outmanoeuvre doctors on his re-examination.  Casually picking up a paper in the mess, Currie found he had been awarded the D.S.O. the first he had heard of it.
