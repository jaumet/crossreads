<p>we have been punching through the winter months.<br/>Major Holdsworth lectured us last night on our duties in the field &amp; by all accounts he expects us to be in France within a few months time.<br/>I went for a long ride this morning &amp; got my column of horses mixed up in a Camel Convoy which was about 5 miles long &amp; consequently was very late getting back.<br/>Somehow or other I have a homesick feeling on me to-night as I sit on my bunk writing this up &amp; at the present time  I would give my whole <strike>worlly</strike>  worldly fortune to be back.  I have a fancy that all our mail is being held up whilst the troops are moving.  Such being the case I suppose everybody will naturally wonder what has become of us.<br/>The 1st &amp; 2nd Divisions are now on the water &amp; we will Sail if everything goes O.K. in a months time, &amp; a happy good riddance of Egypt.<br/>Just fancy last Saturday (18/3/16) by date is the 4th month out of N.S.W.  I wonder how many more are to pass before my return.</p>
