<p>there, I like "Birdy", he gave me a friendly nod, not that he knows me, but he's not a bit like a general with the boys. Generals Monash &amp; McLagan were also there. Billy came round afterwards, &amp; shook hands with two ranks, &amp; our old Brig., who was evidently busy &amp; wanted to get away, said "Is there anyone here knows Mr Hughes personally?" There was no reply, so he spoke in Billy's ear &amp; drew him away. I was one of the last to shake with Billy, he called me "sir." After tea we all drew extra arms, bombs &amp; grenades, pick &amp; shovel. Lor' knows how we'll go over the top with all this load, a chap won't have the strength to bayonet a plum pudding, let alone a Fritz. Our platoon officer Mr Smith, explained our position on the map, &amp; how to read a map by the numbers &amp; letters, to the N.C.O's of his platoon. We are hoping the attack will be very successful, &amp; that few of our good lads may fall. Our company moved up to the line tonight, Boo's will go up tomorrow night. I saw him, also Smith &amp; Eldridge before we went up, &amp; wished them luck. We got to the front line safely, &amp; the 50th Bn went out. There is a lot of luck in this game alright, on the road up, Fritz was dropping shells both</p>
