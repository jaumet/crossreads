MondayWent up to headquarters yesterday said farewell to the boys & the boss. he was very pleased to have had too such decent chaps on the run, they are not always to be found among the Wallaby men, certainly we did not kill our own mutton, as we might easily have done. for which if we have done wrong may we be forgiven. The scrub hens are building up their nests again I was going out to one this morning about 3 miles away but I wont bother now. Chas is going down to Yetman this morning. So that I will be able to tell you how he gets on.
Our box of treasures (very few) will arrive in town no doubt before I will. I am sending it per Wright Heaton & Co. they will collect at your end of course. When I get down I will be able to repay you. Should the trunk arrive before me get father to force the lock. there is a lily bulb inside which will want attending to. I hope it will grow. the emu eggs on the top belong to Chas. the others are mine.  I don't think I would make a good war correspondent. I would use up all the note paper on the first charge. I seem somehow to have the nack of using up a lot of ink and paper whenever I want to put anything into print  With love to all from Alan L. hoping to see you all before long.
[Written in margin] There was no work for Chas at Yetman.
