<p>6<br/>British took over the Somme from the French. The dugouts are all about 30 feet from the ground, all stoutly timbered, a neat wooden staircase with a rail leading down, and nearly all lit by electric light. Of course much of this was taken away or destroyed. It is certain that they simply evacuated the line during the bombardment. Well, now the three of us live in just such a place, &amp; read our letters, &amp; chat, &amp; smoke, &amp; cook steak. Our luck is right in, for we get our rations, &amp; can do as we like with them. No watery tasteless stew, no fear, good wholesome fried fillet. Jove, if you could only see us. It's one of the pities that you cant see us when we get a good possy, they are only too few. Down here in "de bowels of de earf", there is no sounds of guns, just a kind of dull thud, &amp; if a heavy cannonade is going on, just a few crumply pieces of earth through the cracks in the ceiling. Otherwise blissful quietude.</p>
