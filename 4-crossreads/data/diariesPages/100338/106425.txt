[Transcriber's note:
Parsons describes his time in a prisoner of war camp until the end of the war and then the period spent in England awaiting repatriation and his return trip up until leaving Colombo, Ceylon. His treatment in the camp seems rather benign, he refuses to work without appearing to suffer any consequences and is right up to date with the activities in France and the disruptions in the German parliament. He does not say how this information is received. While awaiting embarkation in Sutton-Veny, Wiltshire, he contracts influenza and is extremely ill.]
