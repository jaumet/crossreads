Red Cross &amp; Y.M.C.A.
To the Editor "The Egyptian Gazette"
Sir,
In regard to the discussion on the above subject that has appeared from time to time in the columns of your paper &amp; which was initiated by an "Australian woman" drawing public attention to the donation of &pound;500 by the Australian Red Cross Society to the Y.M.C.A. building fund &ndash; it appears to me that the whole question resolves itself into this bald statement of facts :-
(1) the sum of &pound;10,000 was subscribed by the people of Australia &amp; was officially earmarked for the purchase of comforts for Australian soldiers &amp; for them alone.(2) part of this sum has been donated to the Y.M.C.A. building fund.
Admitting unreservedly that the Y.M.C.A. has done excellent work for our Australian soldiers &amp; even granting that our men have been supplied with Red Cross comforts there is no justification for this distribution of money to be used for a purpose other than that for which it was specifically intended.
We know that the people of Australia provided the wherewithal to ensure
(1)  that our wounded en route from the Dardanelles to the Base here in Egypt should be well supplied with bandages &amp; dressings, pillows &amp; pyjamas,
