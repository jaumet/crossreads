<p>Gallipoli Peninsula<br/>2nd June 1915</p>
<p>My Dear Mother, Father, Brother  &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>Now that my Company has been relieved from the Firing line for three (3) days I have a chance of answering your letter which I received about a fortnight ago. I have seen now nearly six (6) weeks of active service at the abovementioned place against the Turks. No doubt you have by now heard of what the Australian Troops have done, how we landed with only twelve thousand Troops on Sunday the 25th April against thirty Four thousand Turks, the Sunday we landed we had no trenches, but the Turks were well entrenched however we drove them back out of their trenches</p>
