<p>this trench where we put in the livliest 4 days I'd had for a long while. A wide open trench, it was infiladed from both flanks with machine gun fire, and Day &amp; night was raked from End to end by Artillery and trench morters. I dug a little sitting position in the safe side &amp; roofed it with 2 Bomb-proof waistcoats and a piece of Board. Over these I piled about 2 foot of earth &amp; here I sat to eat &amp; sleep. The 3rd day in a coal box burst right on top of me about 3 feet up, taking everything off except the piece of board &amp; leaving me untouched except for being deaf for the next 5 minutes with the concussion.</p>
<p>This was absolutely one of the narrowest escapes I had had to date and I cannot make out how I was not riddled with schrapnel as each side of the truck was peppered. It was while in here</p>
