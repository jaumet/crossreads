<p>pennies. In Egypt the children ask for Backshish, in the France the children ask for a souvenir.</p>
<p>We often see French soldiers, in their quaint blue uniform as we travel through the country.</p>
<p>April 7th. Friday</p>
<p>Noticed primroses growing on the banks of the railroad.</p>
<p>Slightly wet this morning. Passing through splendid grain-growing country. Travelled through the famous Forest of Fountainebleau to-day. Fountainebleau station is very pretty.</p>
<p>Reached the station at Velleux St Georges at twelve o'clock to-day. We had been travelling continuously for fifty two hours. At this station we had to wait for six hours to change our train.</p>
<p>We left this station at four o'clock and had a splendid reception from the people all along the line.</p>
<p>( <strike>The</strike>) An English nurse maid, apparently from the large house near by, who was standing at one of the stations which we stopped threw a number of magazines amongst the troops, who like the children with the pennies hustled and pushed one another to get them.</p>
<p>We were disappointed because the authorities thought it best to avoid Paris, a city, at one part of the journey we were quite near to.</p>
<p>A French munition worker travelled in the same carriage as us and although he could not speak a word of English, by means of a French Dictionary we managed to instruct one another in a few words of our languages.</p>
<p>We had to change trains twice during the night time. The night was bitterly cold, but by the kindness of the Red Cross</p>
