Moved on this evening and camped for the night in a certain village. The whole countryside is a ruin, trees, shrubs. Villages have been ruthlessly destroyed, our gentle Hun is nothing if not thorough. He made great belts of barbed wire entanglements to stop our cavalry. He is still retiring slowly.

Went to the line last night with ammunition for Machine guns. It was strange to be walking about over stubble feilds ducking bullets. There is not a bit of cover. We were moved to a bivouac in Velu Wood. Have made a shelter of the boughs of a Yew Tree. It is an evergreen. Generally from the pastoral aspect of everything it is hard to believe there is a war on.
