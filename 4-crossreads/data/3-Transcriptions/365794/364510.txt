<p>Thursday 19 [18] April 1917 [1918]<br/>Sewing grey silk underskirt, writing letters &amp; reading passes the long day.  Pts. watch me from roof, grounds, windows opposite &amp; run up &amp; down ladder outside window what time I bathe, get out etc., while all day orderlies fly in at any old moment to answer bells so any modesty I entered Choubra with is long since flown.<br/>N. Warrell visits me and the soft &amp; gentle Matron, Miss McLean, not long from Khartoum comes for a friendly chat.  New night nurse, 3 yrs. service in Egypt, pleasant woman &amp; quiet.<br/>10 a.m. comes M.O. &amp; after feeling pulse as usual remarks "Oh, yes a much better pulse today, doing well, pulse from 64 to 80 very good, soon take a swab, good morning sister" &amp; so leaves me.<br/>For such a tiresome pt. consider I have not been as bad as I expected, that is all I can say.</p>
