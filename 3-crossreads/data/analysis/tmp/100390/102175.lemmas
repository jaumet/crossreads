 By Jack Sommer written at Anzac publish in Sydney Bulletin 1915 JS. Anzac Let the deep gun toll their knell They who fought so hard and well ; Let the westwind sing a drige Pile wreath of Saro ? surg . Let the shrapnel 's fleeci white , Cloud by day and fire by night , Deck their grave along the height ?Samothrak ? golden crown Brood abov the hallow ground . Gaba Tepe battl torn In her sunlight seem to mourn ; Where our southern hero fell , Let the deep gun toll their knell .
