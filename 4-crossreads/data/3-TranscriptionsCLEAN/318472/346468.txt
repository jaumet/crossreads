 Another sad case of  suicide  today. following on that of Sunday last. One of the lads named Ray threw himself over board in spite of all efforts to pick him up he was lost. We are having rather rough seas now but the wind and waves are in our favour being almost astern We passed the island of St Paul at about 2 - 3 P.M. A barren rock covered with a thin layer of sand & perhaps a few miles in length Usual Church Services.
