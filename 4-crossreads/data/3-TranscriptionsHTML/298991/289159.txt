<p>Wednesday April 18th<br/>Every day longer I am here, I hate the place more, there seems no hope of our being sent to our own hospital, &amp; the treatment is cruel, it makes a fellow wish to goodness he was well up in the front line trench, although I hope never to go back there again. Very dull weather, still snowing. Feeling much better today, although I had rather a bad night.</p>
<p>Thursday April 19th<br/>There is a lady who comes round every Wednesday &amp; pays the Australians; we are allowed to draw 3/6 a week. I have had no need to draw any so far I still have about 14/-, She is an Australian. Very fine day, sun shining nearly all day.</p>
<p>Friday April 20th<br/>A lovely day. Dr marked me as a walking out patient. The weather is that enticing that I would love to go for a real long walk, but I am not strong enough on my legs yet. A convoy arrived this morning, we received about eleven patients which just filled our ward up, there were a couple of stretcher cases. Went to the pictures (cinema) this afternoon. They are shown every week for the benefit of the patients. Had quite an enjoyable time. It is about a quarter of an hour walk from here. I felt a bit tired when I got back. The fellows here are up to all sorts of jokes of a night time, there are some real hard cases among them. I don't suppose there are two out of the same unit here.</p>
