<p><u>Sunday 23rd May 1915.</u>  At 6am a deep-sea pilot came abreast and said he had orders to shift us to sea.  As the Skipper had no orders he instructed him to pilot us to an anchorage in the bay instead.  The Sultan arrived from Cairo during the afternoon to spend the summer here.  For this auspicious occasion the streets were gaily decorated.  After tea I went ashore and went for a walk around the city.  Two other officers were with me and it was with the greatest difficulty we kept together.  There was an enormous crowd parading the streets, and the gharri's were lined up in hundreds.  We visited the Casino, a place where vaudeville turns are given gratis, while people partake of their drinks.  A huge crowd of soldiers were in town, their khaki showing up against the sombre dress of civilians.</p>
