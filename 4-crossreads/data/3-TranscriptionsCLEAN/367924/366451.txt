  
 I write to Birts wife fairly regular, she writes a very nice letter. I am sorry to hear that she is not very well, no doubt she has a lot to worry her, especially with both her brothers in the firing line now, has it must he terrible in France just now. 
 I still have the little pillow that I brought from home, I would like to be able to bring it home with me again, but I am afraid that I will loose it next time we shift out, as I believe that we are only carring our overcoats and our rations, they have taken our bayonets and ground them up, so it looks as if we are going to have some bayonet charges and on horseback too I believe, so there will be some thing doing any time now. 
 Poor old George must be having a rought time of it. And Denny's arm is not alright, he has had a run of bad luck alright. Is Captain and his wife still away. Just fancy Frank Butler wanting to come down their and work, I wonder what Mrs. B thinks of the war now. I can tell you that the ones that should have came here and dident are going to get a very rough time of it when the war is over and the men all return, that is when they are going to feel their position. 
 Remember me to all my friends. Kind regards to the boss, is Alie still has pally with him as she used to be. Well I must close with sending you my very best Love. Take every care of yourself. Good Bye for the present 
 I remain Your loving W. Weaber.
