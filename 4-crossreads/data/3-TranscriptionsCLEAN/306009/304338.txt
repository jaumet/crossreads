  
 1915 June 1 Tue. We have just received  spec  by the Kyarra, special reinforcements consisting of 32 men. An officer & 3 more men who were away on transports, reported back to-day looking fit & well. Lemnos Island appears to be a strong advanced base for the Med. Exped. Force.  There are several hospitals there including 1st & 2nd Stationary Hospitals which came over with us on Kyarra - lucky dogs. Received some letters to-day posted in Sydney in January. Wherever have they been?
