<p>doubt an officer and a gentleman. Although a lot here gives him a bad name<br/>2/10/1915<br/>A terrific bombardment last night, on the right flank, held by the French, in fact a fair amount of shooting all day. Hostile aeroplane over this evening, just scouting about. A new hospital in position, and nine tents erected during the night. He just flew over it and made off. Two shots followed him. The Howitzer party left this morning at 6.45 enroute for Alexandria. The Battery is now in four pieces. We are now waiting for transport, things are at a standstill everything postponed. Today the Vet Officers horse is attached to the 2nd Battery. A note today from the provost Marshal, complaining of the state of the camp, rather sudden considering that the vehicles had hardly left. Heavy shooting by the Navy this evening over Krithia Village<br/>3/10/1915<br/>Sunday nothing doing. Not a shot fired so far today. A large number of troops arriving. We are still waiting for orders to move. We have everything packed up ready</p>
