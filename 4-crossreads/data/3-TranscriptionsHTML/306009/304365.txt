<p>1915<br/>June 28 Mon.<br/>Visited the Acquarium (&frac12; piastre admission) which is quite near the Hosp. Fish in glass cases let into walls of a big grotto which is in pretty gardens.<br/>After tea went for a walk through the extremely pretty Gezira Gardens.<br/>Everyone  must now have a pass to get out the gates of the Hosp.<br/>Formerly the guard was very lax &amp; patients in pyjamas could be seen everywhere even in Cairo streets. Members of No. 2 G.H. have permanent passes.</p>
