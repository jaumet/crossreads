Sat. July 7th Spent a rotten morning at Squad Drill. After Dinner we gave our tin Hats in to get painted. Frank Woods returned from Blighty.

Sunday July 8 Another Air raid on London. That’s Bad news. It’s nice to know that the Frenchmen shook Krupps up a bit Gen. Holmes killed & Billy Holman suffering from shell shock. Fritz is doing some damage this week, but our turn will come. It rained heavily this morning, & we had to go to Henencourt again to practise for a display before the King on Thursday. Finished Letter 24 to M.S. also posted her some P. Cards & a few copies of the "Tattoo".

Sunday Monday July 9 Mother’s Birthday
Another wet day. Went out to Henencourt again & put in some good work preparing for the great event next Thursday. Yesterday Tom Shearer fell foul of Barrisgill & he is banned from drilling with the Botts. The weather cleared up after Dinner & two scratch Teams played Rugby League. A very enjoyable & amusing game.
