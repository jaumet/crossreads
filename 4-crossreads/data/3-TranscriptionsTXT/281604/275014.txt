 home at reveille next morning. It was at this billet where we started our training which consisted of 4 hours hard work of a morning &amp; recreation of an afternoon. On the 30th I was made Lance Sergeant. December  Next day the 1st we were taken by motor lorries to Elaphes for a bath which was very acceptable. Whilst in these billet the battalions took up football &amp; a great number of inter company &amp; inter Battn matches were played thus helping to break the monotony of training etc. We next made a move on the 14th &amp; marched as far as Zoetux where we put up for the night &amp; next day marched as far as Ledingham &amp; it was a fairly long march. Next morning we had to pack up once more &amp; marched to the old Mill at Assingham &amp; it was very cold. Our stay here was very short for reveille was at 3 AM next morning the 17th &amp; after a scanty meal set of on the march with a blizzard blowing in our face &amp; went as far as Hizernes where after a lot of waiting &amp; fooling about we entrained. After spending a few miserable hours owing to being jammed in we reached Neuve Eglise where we disentrained &amp; marched to Ramille Camp at Himmel. This camp is well organised &amp; compact &amp; therefore we were very comfortable.
