<p>Flanders<br/>We have been in this part of the front for about five months while the battalion was resting at Millencourt, on the Somme I went for my leave to England, had an enjoyable time, spent the greater part in Bradford. On rejoining I found that the bn. was still at Millencourt. Shortly after I was sent to the Anzac Signall School, there I did well, obtaining an A.1. certificate, on rejoining again, found the bd. at Lynde, they had been there about a fortnight &amp; remained there another  fortnight, then we moved up to the front</p>
