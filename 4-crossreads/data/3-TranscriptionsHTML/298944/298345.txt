<p>answer was in the affirmative.</p>
<p>We are now, 27 of us, in one of our old friends the horse-boxes, at Wizerne, (where we were once before) bound for the Somme. The news came out rather suddenly yesterday. Before then we were under the impression that we were going to the Boulogne area for a rest. Now it seems we are leaving the train at a place the other side of Abbeville, whence we shall be transported by motor lorries</p>
