  
 three weeks of my furlough to do  a sergeant in the pay office gave me 5/- for the day and entered it in my pay book in advance, so went out to brixton by tram some few miles out of London to the skating rink spent in there till 6 o'clock where I had to meet my mate who came to Scotland with me and then came back to London had tea and went to the vaudeville theatre in The Strand a very good show after caught a tram to Russell Square and went home to bed.  but while I was at head office in the morning I may state there was a registered parcel which contained a truth and a Herald from Melb for me they were dated Oct 2nd 15
