<p>The Salvation Army and address with flag emblem.<br/>Military camp, Liverpool N.S.W.<br/>Tuesday Night 29.6.1915.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 1.7.15.  J.W.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I arrived back here this afternoon, &amp; found everything upside down.  Firstly we have changed huts altogether (at dinner-time to-day this happened)  We are F2 Coy no longer but have been drafted into the reinforcements &amp; my address is now Priv. J.L.W. 3rd Reinforcements 17th Battalion, Liv. Camp. Sydney.  Then I found that Walter had gone into Sydney at dinner-time today &amp; that he hadn't received any letters at all from you so I was beginning to shiver lest my medical certif. had gone astray; so I set out to look for it &amp; it had only just come in, (the one you posted Sunday Night)  Even tho' addressed to Walter I had to <strike>get</strike> open it, solely to get the certificate out.  Your 2nd letter of Monday Night has not yet arrived  I forgot to say that Walter went into Sydney to get an Officers Uniform as he is to go into the O.T.S for certain on Thursday.  I had a rare picnic collecting my blankets pillows etc as they were all over the place when the changed huts. &ndash; Feel A1 at Lloyds now &amp; fit for anything   Expect we will be pushed forward now as we are reinforcements.  Have to fix up my prolonged absence in morning.<br/>Love to all at home,<br/>Leo.<br/>Still address letters to F2 Coy.</p>
