<p>September, 1917. Wednesday 5<br/>Perfect day. Great raiding activity last night and bombs fell fairly close. This morning two german planes hovered over Bailleul for 15 minutes attacked by many M.GS &amp; AA guns but both eventually got off Bailleul bombarded a lot lately. Painting all day signs for use up line.</p>
