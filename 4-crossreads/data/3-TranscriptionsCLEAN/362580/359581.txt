  
 from Dorothy.  Poor kid I hope she will not be sea-sick.  I wish I had been with them but suppose something is in store for us. 
 Do you ever see or hear from Mr Tom Newton?  If so remember me to him & tell him Dorothy & I are separated once more. 
 Suppose Charity has told you the news by now.  I had a nice letter from her a few weeks ago & one from her hubby the last mail.   Hope she has good luck & everything goes well with her. 
 Fondest love & kisses to you all. 
 From Your loving sister Edith.
