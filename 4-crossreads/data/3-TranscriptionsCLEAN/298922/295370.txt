BIR-el-ABD
Arrived here. You will remember me speaking of BIR-el-ABD last July - now a big military Camp, Pumping Station, Hospitable etc. & a canteen both wet & dry.
[The following is crossed through]2 Officers came along & offered 2 bottles of Beer (with patent costs) for some butter. After they had gone we found bottles refilled with Water - Assualt made & Bivouacs wrecked - am afraid there will be many sore heads tomorrow, so many of these chaps overdo it when they reach a Canteen.
[continued from the end of previous page]sorry after all Mother's work but am afraid it went "down" a boat.
