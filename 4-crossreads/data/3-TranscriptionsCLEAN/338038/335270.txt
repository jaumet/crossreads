  
 9.11.16 My dear Father & Mother, 
 Ted forwarded me your cable received by him on the 7th. I wrote fully from France on the 16th, (the day after my accident occurred) giving full particulars, but as this letter would not reach you for another fortnight, I thought it advisable to cable as follows: 
 "Small bone ankle broken through fall, set satisfactorily duly requires rest" 
 You would naturally be anxious for particulars, but don't worry about this for one minute. It is only a simple fracture, and there is not the  remotet  remotest chance of the injury being permanent. It is now being massaged daily and in a week at the outside I should be able to start walking on it. I have put on a lot of weight the last few months (14st. 11 lbs) and it will not do to hurry it too much. 
 I am getting first class attention and am most comfortable
