<p>regards this war the Prince maintains a strict neutrality with an eye to</p>
<p>business after the war of course.&nbsp; His neutrality however is not so strict</p>
<p>as to intern British Officers who wander about his domain in uniform and</p>
<p>as a matter of fact at his invitation we visit his palace and gardens at</p>
<p>will and attend his theatres free of charge.&nbsp; His Palace on the</p>
<p>Promintary at Monarco simply bristles with guns which point out over the</p>
<p>sea in most menacing fashion.&nbsp; I was however, unable to find one dated</p>
<p>later than 1770.&nbsp; His army which wartime economy has reduced to three</p>
<p>men is dressed up after the style of the announcers outside picture shows</p>
<p>and it solemnly walks up and down in front of the Palace to the awe of</p>
<p>the inhabitants.&nbsp; The Museum and Aguarium which are housed in a</p>
<p>magnificent building right on the sea front are well worth a visit.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>Aquarium contains an extraordinary collection of weird sea animals all</p>
<p>kept at a temperature to suit them.&nbsp; An octopus with a spread of about</p>
<p>four feet occupies one tank, a turtle three feet across flounders about</p>
<p>and seems to enjoy life, sharks, live sponges, star fish,cuttles and</p>
<p>fearsome looking deep sea cretaures all find a tank and settle down to be</p>
<p>fed at stated intervals, although at any time half a franc given to the</p>
<p>attendant to tickle the octopus&#39; appetite is money well spent.&nbsp; One deep</p>
<p>sea genius who apparently inhabited the darkest depths of the ocean had</p>
<p>a headlight arrangement rigged high up on his &quot;hump&quot; (the hump being after</p>
<p>the style of a schnapper) and when he was hungry he had merely xxxx to</p>
<p>turn this thing on and wait.&nbsp; Small fish coming along would see the light</p>
<p>and to avoid it would dive - right into the ingenious gentleman&#39;s mouth</p>
<p>which was situated fully 6 inches under his headlight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Museum is stocked with remains of more strange fish also</p>
<p>whales, seals, sea lion and various whaling gear and articles collected</p>
<p>by the Prince during his whaling cruises in his yacht, the &quot;Princess Alice&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Golf Links are at Mont Argel about 2,000 feet above</p>
<p>Monte Carlo and a great deal of work must have been put in to make them</p>
