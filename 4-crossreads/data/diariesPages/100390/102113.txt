My Dear People
You must forgive the brevity of this note. My hands are badly poisoned with these awful flies. Every chap has septic sores from these flies. My hands are bandaged up. Its very painful too I can tell you ? the flesh refuses to heal the sore just spreads spreads. God what a nice clean country Australia is after the East. Ill get alright some day its all in the game 
Yours affectionately
Jack
