<p>About 8.30 this morning we sighted five Transports, Auxilary Cruiser, and French Warship.<br/>At 9.30am we started going round in a circle as we had to wait until the other ships made up to us and it was a great sight watching the manoeuvers of all the boats getting into line.(These were the transports that left Sierra Leone a few days before us, to get guns at Dakar)</p>
