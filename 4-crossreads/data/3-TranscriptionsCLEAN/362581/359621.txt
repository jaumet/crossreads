 My darling Eddy, 
 This is the only card I have but hope to get some good ones on my way home. This one 'Your King   &  Country thank you" was given to me by one of my poor one legged boys. He was asking me if I had any little brothers or nephews. So I told him about you   &  he wrote on it with great difficulty. Fondest love   &  kisses Auntie Eadle.
