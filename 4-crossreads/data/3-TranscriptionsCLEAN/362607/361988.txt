 Dear Dad, This is another view of one of England's favourite Watering Places. We thought that Manly was the greatest Place on Earth. It   is still  to us. But for Promenades & Hotels, gardens etc. Manly is absolutely out of it. The Beach is not equalled but everything else is tawdry & hum drum compared to English Sea side places. Now in Bournemouth you never see a bit of rubbish or paper lying about & every street is as clean as the Corso on Sunday morning at 9 am. The Cliffs of the Isle of Wight are easily seen from here. I suppose they are about 10 miles away. This Zig-Zag Path is quaint & nice but I went up the Cliff by one of the lifts. I had a note from Norm Upton that I used to work with.  JB expect him over today. But, it is such a weary windy wet day that I do not think He will take the walk on. It is 5 miles each way from where He is camped. No news Dad, except that we are both well & that Winter has started.  Love From Harry
