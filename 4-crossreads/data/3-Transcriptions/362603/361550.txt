<p>Church Army Recreation Hut letterhead<br/>!9.11.17<br/>Bulford<br/>Dear Dad, Mum, &amp; George,<br/>I have answered all your letters except those of 26/8/17 which only arrived a few days ago.  I tried to write last night but I was on Duty.  I am on Duty again to-night but I have left the Canteen to look after itself.  Ellis &amp; I are going to see "The Sunshine Girl" played to-night so I am answering this while waiting to go up.  I have answered nearly all my letters, about 25 last week &amp; now I only have 6 or 8 to do.  I do not suppose that Dad objected to catching a later boat up &amp; an earlier one Home.  He would be able to do a bit of odd-jobbing round the House.  I suppose there is always something to do.<br/>It is a surprise to me to know that the Petostrum (How do You spell it) has flowered already.  There are 3 aren't there.  2 on the right hand side of the gate &amp; one at the end of the bed on the left.  Have You got those old stones near the House hidden up yet.  That is the only thing that spoils the place.  I'll soon fix that up when I get back.  We are very glad to hear that You have the trap to drive about in.  You can have many a nice spin to Narrabeen, go when You like &amp; return when You like.  Does Mum go into Manly &amp; do Her shopping in the Trap.  I</p>
