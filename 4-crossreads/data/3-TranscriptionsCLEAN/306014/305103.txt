  
 Camp at "Lark Hill", about 1 1/4 miles from "Rollestone". 
 After dinner we walked to the village of Orcheston, - about which I have already told you, - but to our disappointment we discovered that we could not get tea at the Inn, & of course the store was closed. We had expected to get tea there & to attend the local church in the evening, but had to wend our way back to Shrewton: Once there we soon found ourselves inside a small mud & brick house with eggs & bacon & bread before us & in the usual way we said good-bye to the victuals. After warming ourselves before the big open fire for an hour we adjourned to St Mary's Church & were back to Camp by 9 o'clock, tired & sore but still hopeful & happy.
