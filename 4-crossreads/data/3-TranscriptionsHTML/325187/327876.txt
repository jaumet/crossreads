<p>Photos<br/>Return to Reg today to Hill 70 (hills only in name, really sand dunes.<br/> [Following paragraph is crossed out]<br/>Lost my job for a time owing to row with a Yeomanry Brigade Major, tell you all about it someday<br/>I said-"The Yeomanry were caught napping" he reported me to Army Head Quarters &amp; General Chauvel sent me back for a while, anyway, as he could do nothing else am afraid I often say too much in these notes.<br/>Our Brigade just marched past so covered with dust they were hardly recognizable.  No Tents tonight under the stars again.</p>
