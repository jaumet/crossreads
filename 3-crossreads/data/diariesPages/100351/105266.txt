10 a.m. we had to report to C Coy. Prepared to Reinforce front line. Under a very hvy bombardment we made our way to line. Gas turned on us made progress very difficult. Enemy had range of communicating trench too true used his knowledge to our disadvantage. Bombardment at Poziers worst of all at any front of line not excepting Verdun. After hanging in for a couple of hours word came thru that no counter attack coming & we were withdrawn to 2nd line Casualties all the time every shell almost. Charlie & self with 5 others buried. Saw to Charlie 1st found him breathing Cleared next man’s head & lungs
