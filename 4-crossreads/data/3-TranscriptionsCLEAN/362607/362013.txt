Bulford10.3.18Dear Dad, Mum & George,Devonshire Cream has been commandered by the Food Comptroller but I had some cider. It was horrid stuff like beer & I did not like it a bit. Devon is lovely. Although it was winter time the views were grand. It must be lovely in Spring & summer time.  The soil is a browny red hue. We are used to chalk cliffs      & it is so strange to see anything else. Ellis has gone out for a stroll  but I am on Duty & can't go. Best of  Loving Wishes.Harry
