 Thurs 28th Today has been warm, but a heavy sea still running & the Small Hospital boat (that takes this sick from the pier to the Ship) has been in difficulties all day the sea would wash her away to the north & towards the beach, & it kept one tugboat busy all day towing her to & from the shore to the  beach  Ship I raised enough energy to go for a swim & do some washing this afternoon the water was not at all chilly & I enjoyed the dip some bullets however cut our swim short as they commenced to fall in the water too close to be comfortable; I believe on Walkers Ridge a good bit of mining has been going on by both sides, but everything is very quiet here, The warboats are shooting every day
