 R.A. to Berrima To Brigadier  I have a document detailing officers for armed forces at Paparatava.  Rebra Raluana and Luttick.  The latter place is high and understood the local name for Herbertshohe.  Raluana is to westward of Herbertshohe on the coast.  Rebra is  high  I believe the W.T. Station now in our possession and Paparatava is about eight miles inland on the road to Toma where Governor was yesterday.  Do you require any more assistance from me otherwise I will propose to go into Simpsonhafen.  Will you have Governor informed that you are now in command ashore and he would communicate with you with regard to handing over control 0740.
