<p>13 July 1918 Saturday (X to X crossed out)<br/>Life goes on much as usual Wiring every night &amp; a good many F.G.C. Martials by day.<br/>X I feel sure climatic conditions etc have a lot to do with latter &amp; I remember how an officer often feels &amp; he is better fed &amp; gets more sleep than the o/ ranks.  I wonder how Joe will stand it    one thing as a Soldier he gets good attention medically. X<br/>Killed 2 Scorpions under my Blanket this morning, they live in the stones with their friends Centipedes &amp; triantulas.<br/>We get many rumours about an attack but personally I don't think they will: too HOT.</p>
