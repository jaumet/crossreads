when old Fritz opens a pretty heavy bombardment with every class of gun explosive he has, I can tell you things were pretty willing for the next couple of hour's, you could hardly hear yourself speak for the roaring, crashing shells bombs, most of the fire seemed to be on A. B. Coy. but we got the backwash of it, pieces of red hot steel iron were constantly digging in all around us the steel helmets saved many a man from a nasty crack, for these small pieces hit with some force, our guns especially the Belgian battery of 75's retaliated hot strong we had the last say, our guns were blazing away a good 15 min's after he had ceased fire I don't know what his object could have been but I think it was on account of our mortars they have been punishing
