 Dear Mrs. Jack, 
 Hope I don't burden you with my frequent and dull letters.  They are dull because there is nothing I can tell you of interest.  We don't do much really & you wouldn't be in the least interested by a recital of the daily programme. 
 Same thing every day, now that I have sort of settled to things I can keep the work well down & have I think too much spare time, so I am going to start swatting up gunnery again.  I have sort of dropped behind lately. 
 The weather is still most uncertain, quite warm & close & drowsy the last few days & we had a tremendous storm on Friday evening, one of the real Riverina ones.  Most spectacular but I didn't enjoy it as I was 8 miles from here & had a bike & was rather worrying about getting back.  However it cleared up & I managed all right.
