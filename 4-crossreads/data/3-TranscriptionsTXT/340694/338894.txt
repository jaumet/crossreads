 9 I had a pass to go across in the Officer's boat &amp; rather enjoyed the trip. A steamer was seen coming down the Canal with her search-light full on. It was a lovely moonlight night but very warm. Coming back I hopped on one of our wagons this side of Canal (They "break" the bridge even night) &amp; rode back to Supply Depot.
