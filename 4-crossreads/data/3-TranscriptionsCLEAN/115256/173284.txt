 More Red Sea weather to-day, so things were far from pleasant on board.  However, it was pay-day so everybody, under most trying conditions, was far from irritable and bad-tempered.  Besides receiving my twenty shillings (most of them have already disappeared in an effort to obtain a supply of good food from the saloon galley, per favour of a certain steward), I was also presented with a few million smallpox germs.  A short time ago I was passed as being successfully vaccinated.  But apparently military red-tape has asserted itself with the result that a convoy order was published stating that  every  man must be done while aboard ship. 
 I only realised to-night what getting to [too] much of a good thing means.  We have all been interested in our brass band, and have listened to it day by day, and have appreciated its increasing proficiency.  But now, the continual blare is becoming boring and nerve-racking.  We get too much of it - too many marches and "patriotic selections".  Anything for a comic opera selection, or a tango dance played by a string band!
