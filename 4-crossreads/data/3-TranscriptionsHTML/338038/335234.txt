<p>SS "Haverford"<br/>June 1916<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother</p>
<p>We are at last out of the "Land of Egypt" and en route for Marseilles, thence we don't know where &ndash; but expect to go somewhere in the North of France.</p>
<p>We left Alexandria on the 2nd inst and have come a very roundabout course so far on account of submarines, which are supposed to have their bases   <strike>off</strike>  on the African Coast. After leaving Alex we went up to the North of Crete, then South West to Malta and are now just creeping along the Western Coast of Sardinia</p>
