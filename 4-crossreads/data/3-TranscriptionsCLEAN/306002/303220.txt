5.7.15Mon. 5th.  Signalling again to-day as usual.  At Steel's Post early this morning our Engineers put 300 lb. of gun-cotton in a drive under the Turks Trenches, & fired her off apparently the Turks also had a mine ready & the explosion of our mine set the Turks off too, a few of our lads were slightly wounded in consequence.  The Turks also gave Steels Post a healthy peppering of shrapnel soon after daylight causing a good many casualties to us.  Stan went to the telephone on Walkers Ridge at 6 o'clock this evening to do a shift in Calthorpes place as he has been wounded.  I went for a dip after making our dug-out as rainproof as possible.  I believe it is nothing but the swimming that is keeping the troops so fit & healthy here.
