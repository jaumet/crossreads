<p>1915<br/>Mar. 26 Fri.<br/>Nothing particular happened to-day.<br/>Rather exciting little combat between members of the Office Staff &amp; others working in Mena House about 9 p.m. &ndash; Turning out the electric light saves the situation.<br/>As the room I have been occupying is to be turned into a ward I have found fresh sleeping quarters on a balcony &ndash; on an iron stretcher &ndash; very nice, too!</p>
