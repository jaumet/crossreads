  
 I got some huge star-fish - weird - red tuberculated beasties & they now lie drying in my cabin - By the way its quite impossible here in Rabaul to get \p-cards - photos or any curios - It's also far too hot to go into the Bush even if allowed - When we got back we found our fellow officers - inboard - very lively - very cheery  & good hearted & shouting drinks for us - . I had a drink & then awoke to the fact that they'd all put in time at Bridge & Cocktails & the Cocktails accounted for much - never mind - we put in a good, good, eveng in true 'roaring ranting' naval fashion - By Jove, this is a life on its own - The man on the beach knows nothing of this life - of course on a gunboat with a small crowd of us, we must all pull together & this we Fantomians do with a vengeance - We've improved the mess as much as  we can  & for the rest say nothing but when we get a chance to get a meal - outside - we take it - True sailor philosophy.
