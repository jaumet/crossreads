Bank in London, so I am getting a chap to draw it for me, and he is going to send it down this week. Thank you and Dad very much for sending it along so soon. There is so much difficulty in getting money cabled from Australia that I thought you might have had some trouble in getting it away. All we are allowed to draw in Hospital is 3/6 a week, it is just enough to buy papers, envelopes, etc. Things are a bit upset in England at present everything is rationed out. 1/4d worth is the total amount of dinner a chap can buy so there is no fear of spending too much in the food line.
I am anxious to get some home letters and am expecting them every day, as soon as I get them, I will write a long letter Mother.Trusting that all at home and the boys are all well.With fondest love to allYour loving son,Gordon
