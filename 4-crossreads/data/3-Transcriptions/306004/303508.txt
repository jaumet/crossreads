<p>3.9.16<br/>Sun 3rd<br/>This morning R.S M. Mc Keown Sgt Laney &amp; I rode to Mahomedia &amp; caught the 9 oclock train to Port Said.  the line is only a small one &amp; we dropped the sides of the truck &amp; let our feet dangle within a few inches of the ground but as we were crossing some points about half way to Port Said one of the lads was pulled off but was not hurt &amp; we continued our journey &ndash; after putting the sides of the trucks up, it was a rather rough journey as we were packed in as close as it was possible to get; the sea was within a few yards of us on out right all the way down &amp; sand &amp; salt lakes on our left. We arrived at Port Said after mid day &amp; there was a rush for boats to get us across the Canal &amp; we.</p>
