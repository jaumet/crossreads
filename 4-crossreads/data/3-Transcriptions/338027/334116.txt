<p>Friday, 8 January, 1915<br/>Whilst galloping his horse this morning one of our officers Capt Ramsden met with what may have been a nasty accident.  His horse stumbled &amp; fell heavily breaking its neck &amp; dying instantly.  We extricated the Capt immediately.</p>
<p>We received a lot of mail from Aust to-day but it was all Dec. 10th so consequently there are three months gone astray.  I rec. two letters but not the ones I wanted one tells me that my brother Harold has joined the force.  He is in camp at Broadmeadows.  A paper came to hand with the report of a divorce case in which our Colonel was co-resp.  The scandal caused much amusement.</p>
<p>Saturday, 9 January, 1915<br/>Melb. papers are greatly appreciated by the men, apparently things are very bad over there at present.  Recruiting is being carried on briskly so our reinforcement must be near Alexandria now.</p>
<p>All the N. Zealanders paraded to-day before Sir Thomas Mackenzie at Gezira &amp; he delivered a stirring address to them.</p>
<p>There are a few black sheep Australians who have been playing up in Cairo and consequently get the Aust. a bad name.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon is now a half-holiday which is needless to say very popular.</p>
