Wednesday 25 October 1916Dull & threatening morning with rain later in the day : miserably cold & MUDDY. During the morning stayed in the tent & got my Xmas cards away. In the afternoon went up some distance towards the line to try & find an unoccupied tent to bring back, but without success. A cold night again & during it a number of enemy shells landed round about us. In one short break in the weather counted 38 aeroplanes up & abt. 20 sausage balloons.
