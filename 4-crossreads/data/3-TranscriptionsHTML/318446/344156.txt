<p>I made very excellent meals the last two evenings cooked by myself.  Yesterday's dinner menu was</p>
<p>Fried bacon &amp; Fried bread<br/>Toast<br/>Marmalade &amp; Swiss milk<br/>Tea &ndash; Egyptian Cigarette</p>
<p>Today's ran as follows</p>
<p>Fried Bacon<br/>Fried Bread<br/>Corned Beef Fried in Bacon fat<br/>Cabbages (machon ochies)<br/>Toast<br/>Swiss milk<br/>Tea - Egyptian Cigarette</p>
<p>Not so bad in fact.  I enjoy cooking &amp; eating these meals more than any others.  One has to live absolutely for the moment here or else one would die of melancholia.</p>
