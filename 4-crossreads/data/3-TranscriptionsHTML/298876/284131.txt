<p>Very hot all day &ndash; arrived in Colombo 8 am. We were just through the fine breakwaters when we heard the bum boats cry of Di Di Di &amp; Ta-a-ra-ra Boom De Ay &ndash; etc &ndash; all li all li all li.<br/>Dozens of the boats offering pineapples &ndash; Bananas., the pines were <u>English</u> variety but of poor size &amp; not nearly the same quality or taste of our own Ripley Queens, the Bananas</p>
