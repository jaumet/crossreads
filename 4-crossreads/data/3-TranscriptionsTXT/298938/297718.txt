I have had two more letters from Rita of Feb & June & she is as staunch &hopeful as ever.In reply I sent last night I have re-iterated my desire for her to come over & marry me.No reply in connection with Corresp Schools.Work is increasing & I always go to bed tired out, these days.Have made about 6/- from photos this week.
