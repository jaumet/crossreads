<p>Toulon. On the way to the railway station we passed the Civil Hospital &amp; decided to go in and have a look round but were politely informed inside that visitors were not allowed to enter the wards. The Paris express arrived at 5.20 &amp; we hopped on board, not however before we were greeted with shouts of hullo, Australia! Where are you from? From several Adelaide[?] tourists who were on their way to Paris from Nice[?] &amp; had just caught sight of the first two Australians they had seen in France. We arrived back at Musso about 9 p.m after an  enjoyable day in beautiful weather spent touristing in active service.<br/>We are on the move again already! Orders were received yesterday to commence packing our equipment straight away in view of an early move &ndash; the original hospital we took over to be kept</p>
