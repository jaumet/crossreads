Tuesday 18.1.16 (27th)We come in sight of land again this morning at 2 am. Some fellows sat up & gazed on it till daylight. It is a high mountainous coast & we are steaming along about 10 miles out. We saw a tramp to starboard homeward bound to Australia. We also saw a fellucca sneaking along the coast south.
A small dhow passed astern about 1/2 an hour ago & when we went up on deck at 6.30 we saw all the Nurses in Pyjamas & wrappers hanging over the side looking at it.
I am cleaning knives again this morning
