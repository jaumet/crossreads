<p>A New Zealand picket was shot last night by a Bedouin. Excitement is running high among the Boys as what Headquarters will do in the matter.<br/>Wednesday Dec 11<br/>The crowd went mad today. Unless something is done they threaten to burn down the Bedouin camp. Things are looking ugly. I do not think it will come to this but I think it is time Headquarters moved on the matter.<br/>Thursday Dec 12<br/>Last night the Division exacted revenge on the Bedouins at Surafend &amp; a camp situated near the lines. They surrounded the village &amp; asked for the guilty</p>
