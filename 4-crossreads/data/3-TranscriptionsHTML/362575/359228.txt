<p>I am very busy here, we do all mounted work.  I have not done any before &amp; it is a great change after doing nothing but gun drill.  It is quite near, 12 mls. to Tunbridge Wells &amp; if stay here another week end hope to get over there.  John's sister may be still living there so will look her up if she is.  It is quite rough country all oak &amp; pine forest &amp; when you go trotting about with guns the poor gunners get jolted inside out.</p>
<p>My sister is down at Bath with some friends but expects to be in town for the winter staying with my Aunt Katie Bowman.</p>
<p>Last I heard of Fred Bell he had been put out of the gunners on a medical test &amp; transferred to the Archies, but have not heard of him for some time now.  Mrs. White is up country somewhere, as Ned was ordered out of town by the doctor, but by this time may be in training.  They have both had rotten luck with the doctor &amp; one would say they were perfectly OK to look at.</p>
