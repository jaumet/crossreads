<p>in the elephant hut we built yesterday</p>
<p>30-10-1917<br/>Dirty, wet, cold, and windy. Full moon, terrific Hun air raid, all last night. Bombs dropping all around us. Although windy, the night was clear. Vance down from guns. His gun out of action. More mules coming to Bty.</p>
<p>31-10-1917<br/>The Hun aeroplanes night raids are getting worse. Last night was terrific. Bombs dropping in hundreds. Two more men wounded, and 2 horses lost. Our hut punctured</p>
<p>1-11-1917<br/>Light fog; Bombing raids awful, terrific slaughter, 30 horses in one Bty killed also a number of men killed and wounded. We are still fighting for the PASSCHENDAELE ridge. The account of the Italian defeat, has cast a gloom over our troops. These bombing raids put the wind up a man. The vibration of the ground is terrible.</p>
