<p>France<br/>15.5.16<br/>My dearest Sister, Your letter of 11.3.16 to hand with enclosed P.C. from little Beres "one of the Gumnut series" thank her very much &amp; give her a huge kiss for me, for thinking about her Uncle.<br/>I am very sorry Ralph has been ill &amp; had to let this years exam go by, it is bad luck after all his hard work, it was much better to let it go than ruin his health perhaps permanently.<br/>Well dear things are very quiet here, this trench warfare is awfully dull, although we are having casualties all the time, one of my best men "an old hand" got a nasty hit last night, a bullett through the small of the back from right to left, missed the spine fortunately but touched his kidneys, six of us were doing a job behind our line &amp; ran foul of a Hun machine gun which darned near got the lot of us, one of the closest shaves I have had.<br/>My leave will be granted very</p>
