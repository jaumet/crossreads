 22 April 1916 Sat A great number of aeroplanes up early this morning several German, exposed to heavy shrapnel fire from anti-aircraft guns. Met & had a long yarn to the old Captain Penfold Sydneys balloonist who is resting our our station. He is very amusing telling of his experiences in the air over Sydney.

 23 April 1916 Easter Day A beautiful day for the sun is shining the first time for over a week. Sid Bragg & myself went for a long walk & had not got far when we saw coming our way two or three battalions of soldiers. They were the South Africans who had just arrived from Marsielles. We then adjourned to the estaminet meeting several good chaps including a D.C.M. of Ypres & also a cove who seconded Carpiartere in fight against Gunboat Smith.
