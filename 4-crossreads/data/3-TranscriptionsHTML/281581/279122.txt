<p>15th Jluy /18</p>
<p>The Heather is just bursting into bloom and the moorland is a gorgeous carpet of purple and deepest green. I scarcely enjoyed a walk more. Mrs F. is a lovable companion and we chatted over our many experiences and times.</p>
<p>16th July 18<br/>Stor my weather and rain throughout the night.  Up at 6 am and left Danby for London by the 7.45 am train. The few days spell has done me a great deal of good and the sun and rest cure has quite given me a fresh lease of life. Changed trains at Middleborough and had a few miles walk around town, which I found uninviting .</p>
