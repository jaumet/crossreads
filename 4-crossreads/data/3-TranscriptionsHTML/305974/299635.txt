<p>3 Thursday<br/>The grass about is getting burnt through the heath.  Every one was checked re enoculation in the morning, some not being done for the different diseases, I have had my full compliment.  We indulged in some bandaging in the afternoon, &amp; it is considered by all that work of this kind should have commenced long enough ago.</p>
<p>4 Friday<br/>Sent parcel containing belt, badges, &amp; negatives home.  Register No is 428.  Gave Pay books in to be audited.  Church service held in church of England to commemorate the beginning of the 3rd year of the war.  Went for a bit of a march &amp; done some bandaging in the afternoon.  Went for a walk in the evening.</p>
<p>5 Saturday<br/>Drilling all the morning.  It still keeps very dry here, rain would be greatly appreciated.  It is beginning to get very dusty, which seems to be a very light dust.  Review held in front of headquarters to General Robertson, &amp; like all the others was a very Keystone affair.</p>
<p>6 Sunday<br/>Went on church parade but it only lasted 5 minutes owing to the fact we had to march to Tidworth in the morning to be presented with the colours.  Slept all the afternoon.  Went out in the evening.</p>
