<p>22.8.16<br/>Tues 22nd<br/>A wet Canteen has been erected by the YMCA &amp; was opened today &amp; good many of the lads are rather merry tonight in consequence; We went over to the Field Amb. again this afternoon for our second innoculation against Cholera, I have been feeling very sick today but am better tonight we had a visitor from the  6th L.H tonight &amp; had rather a gay time here, nearly every tent in the Regt has some Scottish lads in it tonight as our chaps have been rather free &amp; easy today &amp; made pals with the Scots at the Canteen; Mergha Mac went away to hospital a couple of days ago he had been drinking very heavy for some days</p>
