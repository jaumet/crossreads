<p>Novembre 10<br/>Went to the Colliseum in afternoon &amp; saw a good show with Mr &amp; Mrs Smith. Afterward went to his sister's place in Isslington &amp; spent a pleasant evening.</p>
<p>Novembre 11<br/>Went to Liverpoole with Mr &amp; Mrs Smith to see Mr Smiths brother who was wounded at Hellfire Corner. He is doing very well. We had a rather rotten trip owing to a bad train service between Liverpoole &amp; [indecipherable] &amp; to the fact that we missed the tram coming home. Had an enjoyable day though.</p>
