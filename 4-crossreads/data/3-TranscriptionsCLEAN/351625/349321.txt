Dear Mother,
It is just about up to me to write you another few lines, you will wonder at me writing in ink, I have lost my pencil so had to borrow a pen.  Thanks very much for the parcels you sent me.  I got the one with that nice cake in and another with socks, etc. in.  I have received 5 altogether from you & others the last couple of weeks & a number of mails & bulletins.  I am writing this in my tent which consists of a bit of canvas square shape tied down
