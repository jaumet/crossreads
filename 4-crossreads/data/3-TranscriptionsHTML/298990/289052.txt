<p>L'Etoile 26/10/16 Awakened by Stewart (Adjutant) at 2 am with a move order and issued one of my own at once.  We remain here until tomorrow but our transport leaves at 8 this morning and is right detached from us for two days.  We go tomorrow by motor buses  As all our baggage had to be taken too it was necessary to have all officers kits at once.  A wet and cold day.  Laid down a program of work which had to be substituted by lectures etc.  Owing to not having full maps our billeting people went to the wrong Ailly and I had to send another officer to the other place and then arrange an exchange on the busses passing through the other village.  Rumours of big French push and our route lies more southerly than last time.  After lunch the weather cleared and a pleasant sun came out.   The companies were on parade from 2pm to 4.30 pm and did drill and inspection work and also physical exercises and games.  Quite a change for both officers and men to get out and do some drill.  All companies went a little out of the village on open ground.  Went round with the Adjutant and saw them all.  The sun shining on deep greens still wet from the recent rain was very beautiful and twisting little hedged lanes led into the village.  Many fields near the river are dry in summer but at this season are completely under water almost.  A good deal of quiet steady "potting" is in progress.  Men today have improved their appearance greatly by cleaning their clothes and smartening up generally.  Waited for orders all the evening and eventually issued my own after seeing Col Forbes ( 21st) and arranged to have the men standing by early in their billets.</p>
