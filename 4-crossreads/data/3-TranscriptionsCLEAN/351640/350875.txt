Yes my dear I do sincerely thank God that while making you fair he had also made you good, because you have never done aught but done me credit in every way, by act and thought.   Clever and gay truly is the festive Maria, my love to her, the second letter that she wrote to me has evidently gone astray.   Good man Bruce MacLaughlin [McLachlan]?   It is well that the cold has gone from my Joseph, please tell her to take care of herself, and you keep an eye on her for me.
Joseph dear: Glad that you liked the photograph wherein were the pictures of Colonel Braund, Sgt. Larkin, both since dead, and Jerrom.  The idea of having it taken struck me at the moment.  I say the reproduction in the Town and Country which came with the letters this afternoon, a most unusual happening for a paper.   I told Jerrom that his wife and daughter had called, he was well pleased.  I have loaned the papers to Captain Williams as I am busy answering your letters to night.   The town hall show for Dr. and Mrs. Phipps went off very well.   Good.
I am sure that my Kitty will make herself very agreeable to Mrs Fisher for her there will be the attraction of being near to our Buddie, they appear to be as great chums as ever, but it has always been a great consolation to me that you four girls were ever kind and considerate to each other, in this also hath God made you good.
How strange it is that amongst the British when a disaster happens the recruiting becomes more numerous, under ordinary circumstances one might expect the opposite to result.
Your second letter Tabbie dear: I told to you about Sister Draper in my letter of last week.  It was thoughtful of her to call.   On this side no one knows what is to happen next, or with whom one may rub shoulders tomorrow.  The letter to Dr. Harris must have done some travelling before getting to Macquarie Street.  Perhaps it was the Maloja that brought your letters, I should have liked to have met Maggie Phipps.   Kathleen and her sister will not care for Wallsend after having lived in Mosman for so long.  You all think that soldiering has improved Bruce MacLaughlan.  It does the same for every man who is worth his salt as a man.   A letter from Kathleen Bryan came to day, she was standing on the steps of St. Mary's watching the military march    Colonel Holmes we have been told is coming in charge of the new brigade for this
[Lieutenant Bruce Harding McLachlan, 22, a clerk from Mosman, NSW, left Sydney in August 1914 and served withgeneral Holmes in New Guinea, returning to Sydney in January 1915. He then embarked from Sydney on 19 June 1915 on HMAT A61 Kanowna with the 18th Infantry Battalion, 2nd Reinforcements. He was wounded at Gallipoi on 22 August 1915 returned to Austraia mid-1916.]
