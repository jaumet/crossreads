Some of the grease was afterwards scientifically examined, but it was not proved to be human. One of our shells had penetrated the roof of this room. A captured German officer was taken to see this place. He said that it was a soup kitchen and that the Hun in the pot had been blown there by the bursting shell. I often have wondered what the 10 or 12 dead Huns were doing stacked in a row up above. I had a look at one Hun that had been killed on the road (one of these that had been shot down by his own gun the day before). He had the ribbon of the Iron Cross. I felt like taking it as a souvenir, but thought better of it. He had probably earned it while alive. I did not go through his pockets, somehow I never became properly</p>
