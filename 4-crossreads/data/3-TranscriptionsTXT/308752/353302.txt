After tea our usual Saturday nights concert was held on the aft deck, it proved as successful as the previous ones. Both Eric & Bob contributed an item.
So far this has been the most interesting day since our departure on Australian shores.
5th December.Weather intensely hot. On account of the heat church as been postponed till the cool of the evening, the service should be an impressive one as this will be our last Sunday on board. The Chaplain is a real decent chap, I believe he has written home, I hope he gives a good account of the Matrons behaviour. Passed a fair size steamer this morning it was only about 1/4 mile away. We actually saw a female on board the only one we have set eyes upon since our departure from Sydney. They signalled good luck to us from the bridge, & we all cheered him in return. A tropic storm overtook us the rain came down in torrents. These tropical storms are very peculiar they only last a few minutes, & then the weather is fine & hot again. In the evening an impressive church service was held.
Monday December 6th.Another big boxing match was fought on the aft deck, our A.M.C. man again coming out on top. In quite a lavish manner we entertained Captain North & Captain Moralli at night,
