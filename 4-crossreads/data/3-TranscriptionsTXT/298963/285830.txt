 3rd April Reveille at 7 a.m., got up at 8 a.m., told off for duty, passed a quiet day.  Two "Fokers" flew over at a great altitude.  The guns in Albert opened fire on them, without effect.  It was interesting to watch the shrapnell burst all round them.  Washed in the River Ancre which flows at the foot of the grounds. 
 Went into Albert in the afternoon.  Saw ruined Cathedral.  Legend says that when the virgin falls from the top of towers, that day the war will end.  British engineers have fastened it so as, they say, it cannot fall.  Went to Anzac Coves a vaudeville run by the Anzac troops.  Saw Sharo there &ndash; knew him in camp &ndash; he is their commedian.  Very heavy snow fell.
