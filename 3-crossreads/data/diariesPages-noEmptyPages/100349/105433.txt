the Hindenburg Line. It is high time we got some recognition. There is a beautiful old cathedral in Amiens, that is well worth seeing.
9/6/17.
Went to Amiens again yesterday. Had a good time, missed the train smuggled myself on a motor-lorry came home via the Albert Road. We are training briskly preparing for the Contest. Went out today and did a stunt, practicing with "Contact" aeroplanes. Who kept in touch with us during the operation. We attacked in mimic battle over the hills around Dermacourt and burnt flares and made fireworks generally. The country is very pretty now that spring has come again. Am feeling quite fit again.
