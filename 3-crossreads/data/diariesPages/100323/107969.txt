I saw a big whale on a train being taken along to be cut up. White bellied and several times the size of the locomotive. Stayed on board nearly all the afternoon as it was wet. At 7 pm went by motor launch over to the "Orsova" which was anchored in the stream. She is a fine boat with splendid decks and fitted up luxuriously. Meet Mrs Corney and others ? mostly nice girls. Also met some of our Sisters and the cattiness between both parties is really rather funny to watch. Generals Tivey, Burgess and Griffiths were also on board. Crowds of wives, brides and babies. After leaving one got a small idea of what a floating hotel a big passenger ship like this is. Some of the young girls coming out know little about what they are coming to
