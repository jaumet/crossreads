<p>here. We only anchored for half an hour. The Signal ship of this port is "Gleneagles".</p>
<p>At times one thought the signal ship was going to topple over owing to the heavy swell of the sea here.</p>
<p>A few minesweepers passed us in front of the harbour.</p>
<p>Being in the danger zone the bugler does not sound the reveillie. Instead the orderly sergeant of each unit goes round and wakes the men out of hammocks. A very inenviable job indeed, as you can well imagine.</p>
<p>There are so many troops aboard to be fed that the getting of meals is "some" job owing to the congested part of the ship where the kitchen is.</p>
<p>A contrast to the beautifully laid out dinning saloons of the officers who have everything that they desire, and the most of them are better off now than ever they have been in all their lives or ever will be when the war is over.</p>
<p>Beautiful snow white table covers laid with beautifully polished cutlery, and sparkling glassware and china. With soft cushioned chairs to sit on and rich carpeting on the floor. Smartly dressed in stiff white shirt and blue Eton shaped clothes, the stewards dart backwards and forward serving these officers with their every whim and fancy.</p>
<p>Why such contrasts between the men and the officers are allowed I do not know. It is not because they have more intelligence, of that I am certain, for ability is rather looked on with jealousy and is not recognised as a valuable or necessary commodity for an officer.</p>
<p>From what I have seen in the Army</p>
