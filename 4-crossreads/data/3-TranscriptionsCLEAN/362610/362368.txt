Thursday 1 June 1916A glorious day again. Had to take a fatigue party out in the morning & so missed a big brigade parade & inspection by Mr. Hughes & Mr. Fisher, other heads as Gen. Birdwood also being present. From what I heard I did not miss much. The day was evidently a very special one with the French, a number of girls in pure white throughout & boys with white bands & rosettes being seen everywhere, & the people in their best clothes. Got back from fatigue before lunch & went up to the divisional baths where I had a lovely hot bath followed by a cold shower. Great aerial activity on our part while the inspection was on.Busy censoring letters &c. during the afternoon & evening. Very heavy bombardment away to the SSW towards St. Eloi(?)
