4the mummified bulls have been removed to the Cairo museum.
I am living in great style on a Dahabiyeh or house boat on the Nile at Ghezireh. There are 5 officers & the wife of one of them besides myself living on it and we are very comfortable.  It is a big affair with 6 cabins (one double berth) & a large dining room, two bathrooms, kitchen pantries etc on one deck & the top deck is devoted to lounges etc - sort of drawing room affair. It is a bit out of the way but a car calls for us each morning & brings us back for lunch & in the evening so that's not so bad. We are just opposite the sporting club which is an advantage.
I am not sure yet of my future movements. I am hoping to effect a trip to England with some hospital work attached - for six or twelve months, before returning to Australia but dont know what my chances are in the ballot. There are a good many entries & all cant get a place. If I slip for that I dont quite know what I shall do - perhaps return - perhaps get my discharge here or in England. I'll decide when the time comes.
Remember me very kindly to Mrs. Ferguson and, with kindest regards believe me
Yours very sincerelyR.J. Hunter
