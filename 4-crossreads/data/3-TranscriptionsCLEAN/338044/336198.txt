Issued with bread & hot tea & we made a good meal of boiled bacon, bully beef, bread & tea - about the best we had for some days. At 2.15 pm another parade was called &  we marched out on a route march to the wharves, arriving there at 3.30 pm, unloading all our cases from the waggons (hard work for two hours) put on our coats & marched back to camp.
