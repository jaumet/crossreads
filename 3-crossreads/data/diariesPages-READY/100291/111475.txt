1917 Tuesday 16 Jan.
I go to see Bob at Heally after breakfast. Found him safely in bed. very sore but nothing more serious. On the whole he was fortunate, could consider himself lucky. He will probably be evacuated in a day or two to a Gen Hosp.
A heavy snow fall last night transformed the country. It is now buried under inches of a soft white mantle. Indescribably beautiful, especially to us unfamiliar to the sight. Great snowballing going on hare hunting over the frozen paddocks.
