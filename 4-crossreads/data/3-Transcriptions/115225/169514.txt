<p>what damage Fritz had done to Hazebrouck with all his shelling &amp; bombing. it was pretty knocked about especially near the railway &amp; station - I went to Pictures in the evening with Burnie &amp; Scotty &amp; afterwards for a feed of eggs &amp; chips. it snowed all evening&nbsp;&mdash;</p>

<p>Dec 29<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to Steenwerck as usual for supplies - When we got back to Park we had to paint out our shamrock sign (<em>[</em><em>shamrock symbol]&nbsp;</em>signifying supplies) &amp; paint shells on instead in red &amp; blue as we are forming the amunition section, much to my satisfaction - fine day but pretty cold. Frank &amp; Beachy had an argument which ended in blows &amp; then not till Beachy threw in the sponge (which I should say he was in need of at that stage in the region of his face) &nbsp;the weather got warmer in the evening</p>

<p>Dec 30<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We have finished drawing supplies for the Brigade now, their G.S. Waggons will do it from now on - We moved our five lorries to Steenwerck &amp; parked with 3<sup><u>rd</u></sup>&nbsp;D.S.C. in the square &nbsp;- The 12<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;bgd loories took our place with the 1<sup><u>st</u></sup>&nbsp;D.S.C. &amp; the 12<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;Bgd lorries &amp; also 3<sup><u>rd</u></sup>&nbsp;bgd finished drawing supplies for their respective brigades&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
