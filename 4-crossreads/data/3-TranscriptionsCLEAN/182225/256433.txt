NOV.   FRIDAY 10   1916
Fine & warm. Took the guns & waggons out in morning & the guns went into action & the waggons had a battery drill under Lieut Jordan & he is a great fellow & knows his work well. Its a treat to work for him after being fooled about by coves who know less than yourself. Cleaning harness all the afternoon. Poss & self & Charley Scott went down to 28 Camp to see Joe Clonan & Pop Lloyd but they had a big dinner on in the mess & we did not see them. Got letter from father 25th Sept.
