<p>January 23<br/>Blue Henry near Wychaete last Jan.  Nick not yet back, and Clarrie's away in the last draft.</p>
<p>Shepherd, Arthur, Frank D. and Burton deeply involved in the producing of an Amb. souvenir book:  they after sketches or articles:  will try something from old diaries at Mrs. Hadlie's during leave.</p>
<p>A cold good day:  faint snow in the morning, so stayed in bed, and the sun and clearing cloud skies in the afternoon.</p>
<p>38.<br/>Tonight a yarning with one of the official photographers of Bean and the Correspondents and Artists, Dyson and Leist.  Bean left London on the 11th for home with his full war history of the A.I.F. &ndash; so far only read by his two secretaries and himself.  Tale goes of Gen. Monash desiring a look-see &ndash; and later a demanding for censorship!  B stood on his dig, &amp; held it closely.</p>
<p>Tale told of B's close investigations late at Fromelles, of setting out a 100 yd. paced square, and a counting of 5th Divvy old skulls &ndash; 470 to the square after the years.</p>
