  
 August 1915 2nd - on board who waited on us. Good Table. Perhaps best since leaving Aust. Several tried get ashore but pinched by W.O. My name among them, he evidently saw double. 3rd - Attempted escapees lectured only. Issued with bottle of beer or wine for dinner but had to pay 4d for it. About 2.30pm we weighed anchor & dropped the pilot outside bar Sea rough & nearly all sick. Cabins lively, so a poor attempt at disinfection made under R.A.M.C. men. Nearly all camped on deck. 4th - Sea moderated to great extent. Scored good cap & khaki shirt from ordinance when at Alex'dria Also nearly whole corps got infantry packs etc. Also sent letter to be posted at Anzac to Dave. Most of our chaps playing cards & reading all day. Sea very calm in afternoon, no doubt due to islands - etc 4th - A year ago today Gt Britain declared war on Germany at 11pm. Speaking generally, not satisfied with military matters but no doubt,  of  when munitions problem solved, & Dardanelles forced, matters will vastly & rapidly improve. Germans more than holding their own in Europe Advancing on Eastn front & holding Allies on westn front in check. Naval situation splendid, no interruption at all. 5th - Sea still calm, doing about 12 knots. All day yesty head winds delayed us & rough weather the day before. Expect get Lemnos this afternoon about 4pm. Wrote Mater & Molly in pm. Anchored inside boom about 5pm & about 6pm entered, & anchored about centre of harbour. Went in for swim off boat. Got down a rope. Did not enjoy it much as water too dirty & had been churned up by reversal of propeller. Had fresh water bath after it. Put bob in each for fund for tips for stewards & stewardesses.
