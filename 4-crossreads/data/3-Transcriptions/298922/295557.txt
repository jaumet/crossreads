<p>Tuesday 4 September 1917</p>
<p>No word re boat yet. I would of course like to go to Australia &amp; see you all, but am considered very lucky in getting to England. <strike>All today have been interviewing Red + Commissioner &amp; Commandant re getting DOLLY to come back with me to Cairo .</strike>  Nowell did not turn up but came for breakfast he has a cold, but is better today. I go to see him tomorrow. All my friends want to know "How I worked it to get home".</p>
