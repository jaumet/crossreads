From the above you will see that I had two good reasons for not at once informing you of my joining.  In the first place had I been rejected well that would have been the end if it &amp; in the second place I though I would be better able to explain things in person than by letter, as however we are not going to England it is impossible for me to see you in person (for the present at all events) that being the case I must do the best I can by letter. 
 I don't mind admitting that not only myself but all hands are extremely disappointed at being sent to Egypt for that means we shall see nothing at all of actual warfare but instead will have to take the place of the Regulars &amp; garrison Egypt.
