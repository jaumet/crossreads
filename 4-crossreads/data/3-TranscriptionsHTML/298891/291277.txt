<p>Dropped anchor at breakfast time in harbour of Melos where we rode at anchor all day &amp; saw a lot of shipping. Such dull land &amp; puny little white villages like grave yards &amp; windmills. All so white in the glass barren ribbed treeless hillsides. Walked deck for exercise after dinner. Pulled out dinner time as usual. Lovely smooth going.
