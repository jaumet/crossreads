it is From the Sands of Egypt to the Roses of La Belle France".What is in store for us one cannot tell, but judging from the weather we are going to be tuned up a little.I understand we stay in Marseilles for a week, then begin a weary train journey of 3 days nights to the North of France.I am looking forward to the end of the struggle now will be pleased when the 4th Division embarks for Dear old Australia.I am going to try pay a visit to England, as we are allowed 8 days furlough, but of this I will write later on.I am now many thousands of miles away it makes one feel more lonely than when I was in Egypt, but as for that place I hope I never see it again, saving from the deck of a troop ship.We are all expecting a good mail when we get settled down, as all our mail has been going to France for the last month.
