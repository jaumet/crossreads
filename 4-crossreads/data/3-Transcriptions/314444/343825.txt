<p>Mena Camp<br/>Egypt<br/>27/2/15</p>
<p>My dear Mr Garling</p>
<p>I received your long letter of Jan 24th. Letters from our friends at home are very welcome and I can tell you they read and reread a good few times. we get a mail from Australia every two weeks, it takes us two weeks to answer them.</p>
<p>Those who don't receive any letters are very disappointed I am surprised you have not received any letters from Terry for I know he writes every mail, because I have been riding with him on Sundays (mail day) and we always returned early to write letters. I am afraid he has mentioned things about the movements of troops and they have been stopped in Australia. I could at this present moment give you some very interesting news about the movement</p>
