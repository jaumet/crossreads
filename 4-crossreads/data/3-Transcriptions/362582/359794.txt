<p>1st A.G.H. Egypt March 7th 1916<br/>My dear old Jane, I have just received Belle's letter dated Jan 24th, and so sorry to hear that you &amp; Eddy had not been well, but trust you are both quite alright by now. Your T 98.4 is normal, I suppose Belle meant that by 98 &frac12; - It seems a long time to waite for letters now, it is a fortnight to-day since I received the last mail but I have not got <u>one</u> newspaper since I've been here. The weather is getting very warm again, hope we will be in a cooler place for the summer. It is very nice here but it is Egypt &amp; one summer here is enough for me. On Sunday I went to early communion, it was our Chaplain's last Sunday with us, he has left for France. We are all very sorry to part with him. In the afternoon Lady Maxwell gave a Concert to the patients and all the Sisters</p>
