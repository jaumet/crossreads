Tuesday 20 April 1915
All preparations had been completed for the fleet to sail for its destination at some place or places as yet unknown on the Gallipoli Peninsula.  Officers superintended the final packing of our kits, and were ordered to see that every man had his water bottle filled, that he was in possession of a 24 hours' ration as well as two "iron" rations, and also that he had 200 rounds of ammunition and a first field dressing.  All this had been completed, when, at about 11 a.m., an hour before the time set down for our departure from Lemnos, the fresh winds increased to hurricane force.
