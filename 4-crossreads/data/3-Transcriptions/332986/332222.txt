<p>11-8-1917<br/>Hun aeroplanes over during the night; Dropping bombs. I counted 30, Some distance from us. Gun crews again gone to Bty. Showery. Another stunt coming off. Infantry going up to the line all day. Saw one of our planes bring down a Hun, smart piece of work, fell about 400 yards in front of our guns. Hundreds of our planes about.</p>
<p>12-8-1917<br/>Thunderstorm, this evening,  Another baloon of our brought down in flames; Twice this baloon was attacked by the same plane; Our men (2) landed well. Two Hun planes brought done by our men. My shop shelled, working in a place like a barn, cow-shed, pig pens, and stable combined, Three shots missed, the fourth a direct hit, what a mess, tiles, bricks, and timber flying in all directions, boxes of shoes buried. The Brigade Head Quarters cook house filled with dirt. Our B.H.Q camped here, I managed to get out of the wreckage with- out harm. Two or three bruises. Packing</p>
