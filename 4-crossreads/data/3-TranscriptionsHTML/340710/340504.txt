<p>X  Extra page to be inserted at the Cross.  [See next page]<br/>I have talked of a sea of mud but even across that sea of mud several cases of Christmas presents, cakes and puddings arrived most opportunely last night from the War Chest Fund.<br/>To-day the boys are feeling the benefit of these things, their day has been made cheerful by their advent, it has somehow brought them nearer home, they feel that there are still friends who think of them and work for them.  No Christmas mail it has been delayed, no parcels from home but these cases with their presents and a postcard addressed to the donor.  I went into some of the huts.  One chap said "More work for you, sir" I said "Why" "Oh! We've all got a new girl" I laughed and went out into the wind again.<br/>"God bless the people at home," I thought, If they could only see the result of their labours, they would have their share of happiness.</p>
