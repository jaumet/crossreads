 My dear Mother 
 I have just received no less than 46 letters and about 16 papers and 2 prs of socks! Think of it. It has just been too lovely for words. 
 When we first came to Egypt from England, after being 10 weeks from home, we got our first mail. You can imagine our excitement; Certainly no event on the trip has excited us to such an extent. Well, we went back to England, stayed there 2 weeks and, the last day before setting out for Egypt & Australia again, I got one letter from Aunt Katie. You can imagine how delighted I was, for we long for letters. Now, 3 weeks later, I have picked up my last mail before seeing you all again. I hold the record for the remit; 38 was next best. I feel quite proud of my relatives & friends, for they all noticed it (especially the sorters) and chiacked me over all my girls. But I'm afraid Ive been acting like a child for the past 24 hours over it; its just too ripping for words. 
 Therefore I ought not to be unhappy, should I? But I feel quite glum.
