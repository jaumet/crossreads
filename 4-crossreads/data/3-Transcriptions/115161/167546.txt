<p>waiting outside the pay-office, an order was sent along for all ranks to attend a C.O&#39;s parade at once, so again we left the pay-office without our pay. We managed however, to obtain it some time later that day, and in the evening many of us would stroll down to a place not far away, and try to forget our miseries in a little gentle refreshing beverage.</p>
<p>I remember that close to the camp there used to be a little shop where one could obtain a hot pie, or saveloy and roll, so one cold night I wandered down there and asked to be supplied with a hot pie, which the girl supplied to me, I then saw some other fellows eating saveloy and roll and as there appeared to be more in that than in the pie, I asked the girl if I might change my mind and have a saveloy and roll, she said &quot;Yes! certainly&quot;. so I&nbsp;handed her the pie and she gave me the saveloy and roll. while I was eating it, the girl asked me for four pence, I asked her &quot;What for&quot;? she replied &quot;For the saveloy and roll&quot;.

She seemed to look a bit worried over the thing so I gave her the fourpence. I expect she still wonders over the argument that I put up.</p>
<p>Some time before we left camp, we were all vaccinated. The result was tragical, nearly all the fellows were so ill that they were laid-up for two or three days (in the hut). I thought that if I had to go to bed for a time &nbsp;would sooner be in bed at home, so feeling pretty queer, one day I went to the O.C. and told him that I was feeling very off-color, and would he give me a couple of days off to get over the vaccination, and I&nbsp;wished to get away that evening. Unfortunately he would not grant it, so I just went off home with a &quot;pass&quot; just for the evening, but failed to return the next day and the day following. I reported on the third day and everything seemed alright, so I&nbsp;concluded the matter had been overlooked. On the following pay-day however, I discovered that they had deducted two day&#39;s pay. I decided to get even with them somehow, so</p>
