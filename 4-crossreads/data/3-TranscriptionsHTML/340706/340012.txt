<p>58<br/>10-2-19 (Mon)<br/>No snow fell last night but it is bitterly cold. I shaved in warm water &amp; left my razor on table. Returning in half an hour I found the razor parts frozen together &amp; hard to detach. This will give some idea how cold the room is &amp; I dont leave the windows open.</p>
<p>The roads this morning are impossible as they are frozen hard. Even the sun cannot thaw them The inhabitants are spraying soil over some parts but this is only in a very few places. My chilblains on my left foot are now confining me to my rooms compulsorily &amp; not by choice as heretofore.</p>
<p>11-2-19 Tuesday<br/>Had a warm bath last night in a room in which the standing water froze &amp; the windows were encrusted with ice Washing is done in detachment. First head &amp; face &amp; these are dried &ndash; then body &ndash; then legs &amp; feet. After which I roll into bed.</p>
<p>This morning Carr is ill &amp; stay in bed all day. Weather is as cold as before. In addition to agricultural classes I am now attending for one week 9 to noon &amp; 2 to 4 pm each day. Chilblains are deadly</p>
