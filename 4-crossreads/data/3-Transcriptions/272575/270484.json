<p>and though the sky was clouded over when I got up this morning, and rain had been falling it has once more cleared off and the sun is shining.   I hope that it continues for a few more days at least.  it is no use wishing for it to keep on all the time .. for one might just as well wish for the moon.   This particular part of France has little to recomend it, from any point of view so far as I can see.   a coast line of Low sanddunes covered here and there with stunted firs and ragged looking shrubs.  here and there one comes across, a small artificial wood. Oaks, Beeches Poplars etc, but they are nearly all bare now and, so there is nothing pretty about the place it may be healthy enough, and so good for Hospitals and it may be convenient from the same viewpoint, But I dont suppose running the place down will do it any good, or harm either our own coast line, is prettier, with all it roughness and I must say it suits me better.   Coming down in the train I saw very little of the country for we started away from the C.C.S. at night, and were well on our journey before I bothered looking</p>
