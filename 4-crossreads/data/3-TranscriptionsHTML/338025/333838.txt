<p>Tuesday 6th November 1917<br/>7.30 am left lines and reported to 10th Bat. Lines (near Ypres) with wagon. Got a guide to take us to the pits. We had to go about 31/2 miles along the corduroy road. Fritz shell very heavy (all big stuff). Dead horses and mules, wagons and limbers lying on both sides of the road. Very wild looking place, and I was glad when we got out of it. Every pillbox we passed was blown to pieces.<br/>While getting our load of empty shell cases he (Fritz) was trying to get on a heavy battery with his coal boxes. As we were only about 100 yrds away we wasted no time in loading up. Arr home safe at 5.30.</p>
