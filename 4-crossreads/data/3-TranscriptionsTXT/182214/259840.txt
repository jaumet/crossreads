were able to spend all the money we wanted to, Tel-el-Kebir is about 2 1/2 hours run in a train from Cairo so men were given leave to visit Cairo for one day in their turn, I received Xmas parcels from Australia here better late than never & I appreciated them very much & shared them with my mates who in turn shared their own with me. I got my days leave to Cairo & went to the pyramids I went right inside to the Queens chamber its fearfully stuffy inside & hardly worth the trip, our stay at Tel-el-Kebir was about a month. I do not think the boys liked it as much as the Sepereaum [Serapeum] camp in spite of its canteens & other attractions such as Boxing & Picture shows
