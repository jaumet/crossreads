<p>May 12<br/>Took to the Road again today.  Roused at 4 am. Road good along the valley.  We took a couple of Persian youngsters as servants.  The one with Scotty &amp; I boasts the name of Zilleman &amp; is about 13 years old.  A Regular little gun.</p>
<p>May 13th<br/>Easy stage today, reached camp before the heat of midday. Nearby rises a huge cliff from which rushes water from several springs.  Had a good swim.</p>
<p>Tho the place is now called Bisatoun, there still remains the ruins of an ancient city with its history carved in ancient lettering on the face of the cliff which rises at least 1500 feet.</p>
