7/10/18 Villeret
Awakened at 6.30 with orders which involved the Battalion moving at 7.30. Great rush and scurry and at last we started off half an hour late for which I told off Anderson. The Keithlet has a poisoned foot and is much handicapped. I miss the capable and willing little chap. Routemarched via Hesbecourt to Roisel where our cookers gave us a drink of tea before marching to the station. The 6th Field Ambulance came in here and I asked their officers to have a cup with us. Then proceeded to the Railway Station where there was great troop concentration and got about the familiar French trucks "Hommes 30-35 Chevaux en long 8". Our journey was all through the reconquered ground and took us to Peronne ? a fine town laid waste. We also went through Chaulnes all the time
