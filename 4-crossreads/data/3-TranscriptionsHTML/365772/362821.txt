<p>on rejoining &amp; in a few months should get my Captaincy.<br/>I have given a great friend of mine a Capt J.J. Collingwood a letter of introduction to you<br/>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is being invalided back &amp; is pretty badly knocked up - here is his record - came away originally as a private was on the Peninsular the whole time, getting a Military cross as a Sergeant &amp; a commission, received his Captaincy in France &amp; was severly wounded at Pozieres, he was recognised to be our best &amp; gamest officer, a reputation to be envied in a Battalion like ours.<br/>Well my dear sister, fondest love to your dear self- Ralph &amp; Beres.<br/>from Ken</p>
