<p>muffler, balaclava, cap, 2 abdominal belts &amp; about 8 pairs socks, towele &amp; toilet gear &amp; sheep skin vest &amp; a rolled blanket straped round the outside as well as a mess tin which is also attached to the outside, so you can quite understand we have a fair weight to carry but one does not feel it if it is properly put on.  Of course it won't be any fun doing a big route march with it on but I don't expect we will have any long ones.  I am getting the photos we had taken sent to Aunt Greta's, she will send them on to you so I hope they arrive safely.  Excuse this short note but I have a lot to do tonight &amp; not a great deal of time.  Give my best love &amp; kisses to all.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your loving son<br/>Douglas</p>
