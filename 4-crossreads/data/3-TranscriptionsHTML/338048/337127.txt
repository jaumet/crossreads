<p>Friday 18th<br/>Out with cable wagon as No. 8. This is an easy job as you have to stay at place where they start to lay cable to be ready to look for a fault should one occur. There was a fault in the afternoon &amp; I had to saddle up &amp; go out. My horse was rather frisky so I was not able to proceed very fast. When I tested the line the second time I found it working well so returned.</p>
<p>Saturday 19th<br/>Mess orderly today so am having time to write. Rather fine today after continuous showery weather we have been having for last 4 days. Busy all day with mess orderly duties and retired early for a change.</p>
<p>Sunday 20th<br/>Church again at Wilstead and having leave for the day remained in village instead of marching back. We intended to ride to Luton but could not obtain bikes. Returned to camp &amp; caught motor car to Bedford. After having a hurried look around returned to camp. Church again in the evening.</p>
<p>Monday 21st<br/><strike>Stables again as usual and the second parade were detailed to dig dug outs. As usual the required tools were not all there but we were fixed up somehow. In the morning worked and rested alternately while in afternoon had &frac14; hour. rest every &frac12; hrs. work</strike></p>
