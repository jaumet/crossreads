[Two photographs taken in London]1919May 27with, & a ticket to go over Windsor Castle.  After dinner, went with a party over St Pauls Cathedral.  We went down into the crypt & up into the whispering gallery.  The old guide was very keen to display his powers & was very annoyed when some of the fellows displayed theirs as well, by whispering against the wall & making people move on who were right across on the other side.  I also saw the picture "The light of the World".  It is in a very bad position & one has to stand immediately in front of it to see it.  A little to one side or the other, & the light spoils it. Hawker & Grieve (two Australian airmen) had tried to fly the Atlantic but failed & landed in the water when nearing their destination in Scotland.  They were to arrive this evening so made my way to Kings Cross Station to see them.  A dense crowd had collected along the route they were to take & I took up a position at the rear of several people with a 3rd Div. Officer.  A party of Aussies
