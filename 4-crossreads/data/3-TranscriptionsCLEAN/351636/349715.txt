 Dear Mr. Horsefield - I am sending Mrs. Thorne who has had some reduction in pay this month & her grocer & rent bills due 
 Her allowance for the future will be 35/- p w & having two children she is a little under scale 
 I am enquiring into the matter of pay & let you know later on. 
 Yours faithfully B. Booth - Hon Sec
