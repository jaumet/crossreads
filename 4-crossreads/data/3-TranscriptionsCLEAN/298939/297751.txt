  
 Yesterday we had an all-day stunt.  We went to Wollop, a village near here, & had our rations at an inn supplemented by beer, cider & sloe gin. During the day we marched 20 miles & had a very enjoyable time. Today we were drilled for some hours and informed that we are to make part of an emergency ambulance to go to Bulford next Tuesday for the Kings Review. That will be a new experience, to be reviewed by the King, but it will be rather tiring I fancy
