<p>Thursday 17 February 1916</p>
<p>A beautiful day, cold in the morning &amp; evening but nicely warm during the day.</p>
<p>Early morning parade as usual, &amp; there was plenty of doubling &amp; movement to keep the men warm. Marching in at the head of the column from the forenoon parade I got a great shock to find Ollie [sister &amp; wife of Rid] standing near our orderly room: Rid [brother-in-law]was inside enquiring where I was &amp; as soon as parade was dismissed I joined them. Ol was looking fairly well but Rid had evidently not recovered altogether from his tonsillitis. At once went to the Adjutant &amp; got leave for the afternoon.</p>
<p>At once changed &amp; went out with them, getting a "garry" (carriage) close by in which we drove up to Heliopolis. The garry is really a low phaeton usually drawn by 2 horses, two natives generally sitting on a box seat. To a large extent it takes the place of the Ceylon rickshaw in that officers almost invariably ride in one instead of walking. The fare is set down as 3 piastres (2&frac12;.) per kilometre when reckoned by the distance &amp; 5 P.T. (I think) 10p.c. per hour when taken by the time. Most of the horses are miserable weedy animals but the vehicle rides very smoothly.</p>
<p>To the town of Heliopolis the road took us through the camp on the outskirts of which were numerous canteens that seemed to be well patronised by our troops: some of the legends were rather amusing, e.g. "The Meeting Place of Brave Soldiers", "Where friends meet" &amp; so on.</p>
<p>The camp gave place to the town of Heliopolis, said to be only about 10 yrs old, &amp; rather a decent place. Streets in first class condition &amp; buildings of stone or plastered material</p>
