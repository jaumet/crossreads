<p>passing General Birdwood &amp; his staff in the square &amp; home again, about 8 or 9 miles altogether  Nothing doing the remainder of the day.  Taubes over at night bomb dropping but ignored our village.<br/>Tuesday 21st. Aug.<br/>  My section took over the Hospital as I had the dispensary again.  Went to Hazebruck for drugs then out further to the depot as they had moved owing to the town being shelled.  Found them just opening up so went on to No 19 which was at Godewaersvelde almost in Belgium.  They could not supply my wants so returned again having at least had a splendid run in the Ford which I drove most of the way.  'Twas a very interesting run saw plenty of Hop plantations &amp; a large number of new British regiments.<br/>Wednesday 22nd. Aug.<br/>  Had another trip for drugs this time being fixed up at No. 11 so did not have so far to go as before.  Spent a couple of hours going</p>
