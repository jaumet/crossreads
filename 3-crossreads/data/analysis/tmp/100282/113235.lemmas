 So end my trip to Scotland the finest holiday I have ever had in my life , after leav Edinburgh I did not care how soon my leav finish for it would be rotten without Peggi . On the way down to Liverpool we pass through typic Scottish countri all hill valley creek everywher fenc made of granit the old Scotch fir climb about the hill , when we got to Carlisl we had to chang I had an hour a half look round the old town . Ran into Liverpool about 5 oclock I set out to find Mr Hawley 's place which I thought from the address I had was at Kirkbi but no one seem to have even heard of the place not even the policemen , they knew of Kirkdal Kirbi , at ani rate I thought the best thing to do to make sure was to go round to the Post Office
