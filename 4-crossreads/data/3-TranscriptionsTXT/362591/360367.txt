 Egypt 13-3-16 
 My dear Judge, 
 We have come in from the desert and are now at Ismailia quite a pretty place and comparatively clean &ndash; for Egypt.  I have had a bit of trouble with my ear and have been treated at the hospital here.  I come in every day go to hospital, lunch at the Cercle du Canal de Suez &amp; go back after lunch to camp.  It has been quite a nice change and a rest for me apart from the ear troubles.  The treatment has been very successful and I am now almost right again.  The specialist says that it is only a matter of a few days.  The beastly thing pulled my condition down a lot but I am getting it up again as fast as I can now. 
 My mails &amp; parcels have been arriving well.  I consider myself very fortunate in having so many excellent people who always seem to be able to pick out and send just the things I am in need of at the time they arrive.
