<p>Tuesday 13 August<br/>Poor old Ridgeway died of his wounds. Wonderfully quiet all day, but very hot.<br/>Several 'planes have come down in flames &amp; I think that one must have been ours.<br/><strike>A C.C.</strike> The village of Rosieres just on our right is one huge dump.</p>
<p>Wednesday 14 August<br/>A German 'plane brought down by the A.A.'s this morning.  Just now a Boshe plane chased one of our R.E. 8s old slow artillery observers extremely low down &amp; brought him down about a hundred yards away.  It was the coolest thing I have seen, two miles or more over our line but of course our plane had no hope at all. Very hot again to-day.<br/>Fritz heavily shelling Vauvillers just on our left.</p>
