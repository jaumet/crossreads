<p>&amp; a general overhaul of our engines &amp; deck work.  The Australian hospital ship Wandilla arrived today from Turkey with returned invalid soldiers.</p>
<p>15.11.18<br/>The Caladonia arrived today from the Dardanelles after taking Indian troops to man the forts &amp; came back direct here.  She is one of the P &amp; O Transports.  Good news this day re the Germans retreating everywhere &amp; leaving all guns ammunition &amp; war materials behind at the front &amp; of the Kiasar having gone &amp; abdicated to Holland also rumours re the Crown prince having been shot whilst trying to cross the Dutch frontier &amp; escaping from Germany.  Also of a great revolution in Germany &amp; of the Rulers leaving their respectful countries &amp; of the Socialists governing the different German states.  All the Naval <strike>warlike</strike> war ships &amp; appliances are here in Egypt very quiet since the Armistice was signed, a great change from a few weeks ago.  All the hospital ships &amp; Prisnors of war ships are exceedingly busy bringing troops that have been captured in Turkey &amp; the whole coming back in a very poor condition.</p>
<p>16.11.18<br/>In the City of Alexandria the British troops on leave of which thousands are to be seen about the streets a large number being drunk are commiting great disturbances the breaking of glass windows &amp; doors &amp; actually robbing several shops wholesale to the disgust of the respectable soldiers &amp; not a single case of any trouble amongst the blue jackets of which hundreds are to be seen in the City going about peacefully.  A special patrol of pickets are about</p>
