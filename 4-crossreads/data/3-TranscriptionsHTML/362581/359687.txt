<p>My darling Eddy,</p>
<p>Yesterday received two lovely letters from you. I was so delighted to get the,   &amp;  know you are so well. Mother was very good to take you sailing. Hope you keep strong now   &amp;  grow fat. I think I may be home with you this year. The war seems much brighter. Fondest love. From Auntie Eadle.</p>
