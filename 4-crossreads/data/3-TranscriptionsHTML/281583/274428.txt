<p>14.11.16  Tuesday</p>
<p>We passed another terror of a night &amp; it is still continuing during the day. Shells are falling fast &amp; furious &amp; to speak the truth, they have us fairly bluffed. Under cover of a fog Fritz has sneaked a couple of long range guns up &amp; is peppering us properly. At 6.30 pm last night our guns opened up a terrific bombardment &amp; kept it going  the greater part of the night. Regular sleeping was impossible &amp; one could only catch alternate intervals between the tremendous roars of the big guns. Unofficial news came to hand that we had captured Letransley but is not yet confirmed.</p>
<p>The early part of the morning was not quite so bad but it opened up at dinner time again. A very bitter pill for us to swallow is the fact that Fritz has a couple of observation balloons up which can observe our positions, &amp; we are sure to feel the effects of his observations tonight. Already he has commenced by putting over a few haphazard shots, but they are too close to be comforting.</p>
<p>The planes are out in hundreds &amp; wherever you look, you can see little puffs of smoke which denotes bursting shells.</p>
<p>One plane was brought down in flames but I do not know whose it was. It fell in the German Lines.</p>
<p>Traffic is still congested &amp; I do not think it will be right again until warm weather sets in &amp; dries the roads</p>
