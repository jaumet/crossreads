<p>charge here and you had better clear out before the sergeant of the Picquet comes along. Theres been too much stuff   "Pinched" off this line lately."(There has been so many petty thefts of saddlery off our line lately that I have been to Head Quarters and complained and now the sentries on the the Staff and Signallers have had drastic orders on that subject<br/>myself .   " I am in charge of this line horses saddles men and all"<br/>I had been standing close up to my horse during all this dialogue and then I came out the sentry evidently recognizing me.<br/>The sentry  " Oh!
