  
 [Wednesday 27 December 1916] 
 Wet last night but the sandy soil is not as bad as France- Quite a lot of shipping is going on here now,   We hope for better rations soon- Posted letters by Camel escort yesterday, hope they arrive. Hungry Armenians who have been working for the Turks come in all day- All Christians now!!! No doubt our success will help the Sheik of Mecca. We are bombed daily but High Explosives in sand do little damage except to Horses, & a man is not supposed to have any here. I can hear a Turkish gramophone we captured playing Casino airs from the Ottoman City.  Oil sheets were the best Loot
