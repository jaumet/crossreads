  
 April, 1915 Friday 9 Left today for Luxor 400 miles South - the site of Ancient Thebes & the Libyan mountains - I have posted a Photo-book showing these Temples & would advise you reading Baedeker on Egypt or Encyclopedia for information - all very wonderful to think of 3000 years B.C. & yet the Paint in the Tombs is as fresh as if only done the day before. Karuak on one side & Thebes on the other side of the Nile with the Tombs of Kings & Queens in splendid condition. I took many photos & will only hope they reach home. One really wants longer time, but we were lucky to get off.
