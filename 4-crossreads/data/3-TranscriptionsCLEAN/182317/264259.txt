the end of July. When I left over there we had just come out of the line after a two months spell near Armentieres - we were in the line for Christmas when it was bitterly cold but very quiet - in fact it was so quiet that we were several times able to go down to the River Lys duck shooting. Ralston has left your old battalion & is now in England. Jack Scott, formerly of the 19th is now C.O. 20th. Len Robson still blooms forth as adjutant of the 18th whilst Dicky Francis occasionally looms on the horizon looking like a medical officer. Walter Mac is making a continued success of his job of Brigade Major but so far for some reason or other has not yet obtained his majority. What about dropping me a line even though you are a gilded brass hat - the best address to find is care of Robert Reids 19 Chiswell Str, Finsbury London. Best wishes to all your people & most especially yourself. Your devoted admirer Ginger Allan
