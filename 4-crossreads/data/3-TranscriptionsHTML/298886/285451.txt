<p>8.30 pm. Just been haul'd out &ndash; 4 nosebags missing out of the eight which were put behind the horses this evening. Had a "wordy" 5 minutes with the Sergeant of the <strike>Pick</strike> picquet. No wonder all my horses were not fed up at 8 oclock when some of the bags were "pinched" Going away on trek tomorrow some of them are short on nosebags. Very obvious!<br/>Now for bed.</p>
