 I hear an Australian mail is in but letters take longer of late & some say they leave Australia via America for Egypt, what a touch. I enclose you snapshots of my Horse the one HLA bought from Harrison. You see he looks well after all his work. 
 One days pay per Officer & other ranks is being collected for a memorial on Suez Canal in memory of our mates. A life size  bronze  horse with rider, has been suggested. BRONZE. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.]  My pen is bad, but better than pencil. As a mail is going out I send these notes with love to all.
