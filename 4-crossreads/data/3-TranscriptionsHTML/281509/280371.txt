<p>28 May 1916<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>Second Sunday in Etaple camp. Ye. Gods, isn't it slow. No where we are allowed to go. Nothing to do. Everywhere out of bounds save our own hut &amp; immediate surroundings.  We suffer from the misdemeanours of our earlier comrades. Church parade at 9.30.a.m. breaks the monotony. Over in half an hour. Preacher not as convincing as the Scot. of last Sunday. Usual walk after tea. wrote letters to Uncle Bob, &amp; Glad. Robbins, Postcards to Bert, Cis, Annie Gardner.</p>
