12/4/18There are lots of things that happen that we hear of and forget.There are memories that we cherish, there are those that bringregret,There are tender recollections that the darker hours console,But there's thoughts of bitter sorrows that will grip your verysoul.We'd a colonel in command of us, the gruff old veteran brand,Beloved by his battalion and the idol of the bandThe boys all called him Billjim for he'd proved himself their friendAnd swore that where he'd lead them they would follow to theend.
