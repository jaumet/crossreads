<p>My dear friends,<br/>I wonder will it be a pleasant surprise to you to receive another long letter so soon after the other.  You see I was so far in arrears that I feel I must now I have the time make hay while the sun shines, and even though the letter was the longest sent, there is yet a lot I haven't told you.</p>
<p>You know I really do enjoy telling you everything for you seem very appreciative and interested, and I hope overlook mistakes in spelling and punctuation.</p>

I was put in charge of the evacuating section which consisted of 9 large marquees (3 ordinary marquees which consisted of a 9 large marquees being one), that including chiefly the walking cases, gas and post anaesthetics.  It was to the latter I gave most of my attention.  They were called the less serious cases (surgical) that had had operations, but they were mostly big and varies, but were considered fit to take the train journey, and we were always glad to get them away for the sooner they could be made warm and comfortable in a bed at the base so much the better for them, for until</p>
