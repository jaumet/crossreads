 JUNE   FRIDAY 9   1916 
 Another cold bleak rainy day. About the coldest since we left Sydney. We drew out from the wharf about 9 AM  and anchored out in Table Bay. We then carried on as if we were at Sea. Headquarters staff had a buzzer lecture in morning and flag practise in afternoon. I was a mess orderly for the day. Its rotten being able to see land so close & being unable to get ashore. We may be here for some days, waiting for other transports and an escort to take us to England.
