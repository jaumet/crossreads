 Revielle at 6. 
 Stables stables as usual. When we went over to attend to machines we found to our chargin that two of the machines were missing mine & Norm's after looking around I found mine secreted under the Grandstand it had been ridden about 20 miles & was returned OK not a sign could we find of Norm's & all steps were taken for the recovery of it. Maj Williams cut up rough over it & has shook us up accordingly. Lines in future will have to be kept a lot cleaner. Bill gets roared up a treat & is at all times trying to shift the blame to our shoulders. I had to visit the Base depot & met Joe G who is looking anything but well he informs me that he now is a Staff Serg. I then had to go to Kasr-el-Nil for [indecipherable] Home at 6 Bed at 9.15 pm. 
 8 April 1915 Thursday 
 Revielle at 6. Stables per usual. [indecipherable] sent out early to scour the country for his machine first to Mena, [indecipherable] & Maadi. The Second Troop have their new jiggers, one a twin mag L. & two Rudges. An Inf Lieut reports at 11.30 am that he noticed a motor at the baths without an owner. Toby goes over & finds that it is ours so all's OK again. In the evening I ride over to "Charel" to visit that home I'm concerned in & find the little kiddy is OK then go into Cairo, meet all the artillery going away & see Geo Lister. Received three letters from the boys they are having fine times & are attached to the Gen staff & sailed yesterday on the "Arcadian" for Sicily, the wireless are on the Minnawaska with the Company under Mackworth. Bert M is made pretty right with Maj Williams Bed 11.30
