 (A Child&#39;s Shoe) 
 =====&nbsp; &quot;&nbsp; ===== &nbsp; &quot; &nbsp; ===== 
 Mute &quot;pathetic relic&quot; from out the peaceful past 
 What memories awaken, of the one who wore thee last 
 &#39;Round you my vagrant fancy, a story sad doth weave 
 For a little kiddie owned you, &#39;Tis easy to perceive 
 Just a baby&#39;s tiny slipper, lying all forlorn 
 Amid the scattered debris, that was once a happy home 
 Yet you speak of tears and laughter, baby prattle, mother&#39;s love 
 While you shriek aloud for vengeance to  He  who dwells Above
