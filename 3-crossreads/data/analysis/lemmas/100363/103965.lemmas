 The Gener who is fame for his genial gave me a fine display of boomerang throw in which he is expert . The 1st and 2nd Brigad are move toward Deiran tomorrow and I have decid to travel with them . 12 Jani /18 Reveill at 6 am earli breakfast , out in the open under an old figtre . Tent struck , limber pack and the column move off at 10 a.m. The seem endless stream of men and hors wind their way across the plain , recal to mind the great column of the African fight ant on their way to battl . Far away from the horizon the stream move slowli along ; over rise , into valley , across stream it push impress . The men were in high spirit , and the hors in good fettl . I rode my littl favourit Abdul .
