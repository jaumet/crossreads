<p>Sunday Nov 17<br/>Today a few of us rode to Jaffa for a swim &amp; general look round. The Town has been cleaned up and there is a remarkable difference to when we first entered it.<br/>It is now quite a business place &amp; the inhabitants as is usual in this country try to palm off practically worthless souvenir's on our boys at top prices.<br/>We returned about 6pm after a very pleasant day.<br/>Monday Nov 18<br/>Today we visited the villages of Wadis, Heatean[?] &amp; Dieran. They are still the same sleepy villages we saw last time we were down. These are Jewish villages. There is a Bedouin village</p>
