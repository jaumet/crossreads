<p>several of the boys who have returned home &amp; who were with us those dreadful days if they knew anything re his wounds or death, but really I can assure you that there are none who can give us any information.  I would like to know, how &amp; where he died.</p>
<p>What a grand thing for you to have that card, with all our signatures on, very few of us were lucky enough to send or bring ours home.  There is another batch of wounded arriving here tomorrow &amp; if there by chance any of the boys who know anything about him, I will let you know for we all know what it means to hear about ones pals.</p>
<p>Trusting that since writing you have heard something more definite from the Military Authorities.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours faithfully,<br/>A. Maurer<br/> &amp; F.J. Heavey</p>
