  
 30 miles to Swindon in order that I might catch a train for London in the morning. I went sound asleep and did not wake up until I reached the hotel, a filthy little place at 1.30. I threw stones at the barmaid's window until she came down and let me in in a very bad temper. 
 Sunday December 12 th    Left Swindon at 10.10 a.m. Arrived London at noon. Gina lunched and dined with me.     Monday December 13th     Went to Brighton with Gina, George, my brother, and Fenton. We all lunched at the Royal York Hotel with Harry Preston who gave us one of the finest repasts I have ever known. He is indeed a strange littel man. Lectured at the Town Hall afternoon and evening. Marshall Hall presided in the evening. Caught the 10 p.m. train to London. 
 Tuesday December 14th    Went to St Leonards to lecture in the afternoon. This is assuredly the most benighted seaside resort in the world. Lunched withpoor old Gilly Farquhar. Returned to Lodon and went with Fenton to see More at the Ambassadors.     Wednesday December 15th     Made the most extraordinary mistake and missed my train to Bournemouth by driving to Paddington instead of to Waterloo. However caught another and only arrived 20 minutes late for my lecture. Lectured again in the evening. Stayed the night at Bournville.     Thursday December l6th     Returned to London and spent a very busy day, as it hasnow been decided that I shall sail for Australia on the 23rd. Gina lunched with me.     FridayBDecember 17th     Busy day in London. Don't know how I shall ever get off in time.
