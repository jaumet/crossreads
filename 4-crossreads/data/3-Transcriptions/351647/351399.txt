<p>my head 50 times a day &amp; have to crawl in backwards.</p>
<p>The water leaks in &amp; I have to bail out at intervals but its pretty warm &amp; not draughty.  At present I am writing there and at intervals of three minutes a German shell goes whistling over head to crash about 150 yards or so on.  Sounds so thrilling, but I wish he'd stop.  I can't help wondering if he will shorten up some day, the brute does this every few evenings.</p>
<p>One of my protegee's got bunged yesterday, poor beggar he'll lose his arm even if he gets over it.  <strike>He</strike> I was going to get him a billet as married overseer on Bringagee after the war, &amp; now I'm afraid he can't be an overseer with one arm, he couldn't catch sheep or class them or do windmills &amp;c., &amp;c. could.  Poor Edgar he was or is engaged to a nice girl too.  I haven't heard of Tom for ages, we dodge his crowd very successfully.  Duncan Macfarlane rode over to see me a day or so ago.  He loves being an Ossifer in the R.F.A. but he gets no more pay than I do.</p>
