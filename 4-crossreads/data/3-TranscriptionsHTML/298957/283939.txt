<p>anywhere else but to France. At present there is a huge camp of N.Z. Mounted Rifles behind us. A long train of 600 camels today passed over the pontoon bridge. Beautiful day.</p>
<p>17th February (Thursday)<br/>Glorious morning. The monitors "Aphis" &amp; "Scarab" returned and this time I had a good look at them. They draw only 4ft of water. The "Scarab" is slightly an improvement on the other inasmuch as she has maxim guns. Lecture on First Aid by Capt. Donald. First replies to our letters written on board the "Ascanius" received this afternoon.</p>
