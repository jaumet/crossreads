<p>side of the  dug outs protected by stones &amp; bricks from near by ruins. At Lille Gates I saw a very big bell which was being specially guarded for it was considered to be the most costly of all bells in the world. The story goes that a collection was called for throughout Belgium to purchase a bell for the cathedral &amp; there was that much copper &amp; silver collected that it was decided to melt it all down to make the bell with which proved a huge success for the bell could be heard for about twenty miles. Just inside the gate the Australian Comforts Fund had erected a big sand bag dug out where the troops passing backwards &amp; forwards to the front line could get a hot cup of cocoa, biscuits &amp; cigarettes free any hour of the day &amp; night which was much appreciated by all the boys. After having a good look round we made our way back arriving at the company just in time for dinner. At dusk that night I was sent to the railhead in Ypres where I met a platoon of the 10th Battalion having to guide them to our position in reserves for they were to relieve our battalion. When the relief was completed I had to put all my gear on then guide my own platoon back to the Railway yard where we were put aboard a waiting train. our ride in the train only lasted about twenty minutes for we disentrained at Poperinghe where the regimental band met us for they had remained out of the line &amp; we were taken to a camp called Dominion Lines arriving there about 2.30 AM next morning. It was not long before the battalion was wrapped in slumber not being disturbed till about mid-day. That afternoon I was detailed as company orderly corporal being told this duty was to last for four days the duties being far to many to enumerate &amp; there was always plenty to keep me well occupied.</p>
