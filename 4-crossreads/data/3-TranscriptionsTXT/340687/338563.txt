 September, 1917. 15th after Trinity. Sunday 16 Home usual way at 5. and slept  till  nearly all day barring mealtimes. Out again at 9 &amp; 3 of 3rd Squad in by Menin Road on to job. Bombardment easier but plenty of gas shells and got it once or twice thinly. Carried up stunt material for strong point and stopped about 10 to 3 and came home. 
 Motor caught on Menin Road and another capsized on Corduroy. Shelling lighter although our guns heavy. Some men lost their way and didn't get home till 8.
