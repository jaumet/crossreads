 1918 July 27 a London regt in to relieve us. It was not far but pitch dark. I knew the track well, so after picking them up strode off in front of them. Soon I heard "Say choom, not so fast as your legs are too long". So I waited. I discovered that the section in front was comprised of lads about 18. They were very small and their rifles seemed to be about the biggest part of them. They relieved us, their officers asking us stupid questions about where we had our Lewis Guns placed etc. We told them that we had been occupying these trenches for a rest and that they need not have any fear of an attack while the 32nd Bn AIF was in the line 4 or 5 kilos ahead. We found that we had to go into the line again. July 28 We marched to dugouts east of Bonnay near a road arriving there about 3.30am. At 10.30 am Bill Collins and 8 had to go off as advance party for our Company to Morlancourt again. We went through Maricourt. Some mobile batteries had been pulled in here in readiness for the stunt. We stopped at Ballarat line for a bit, then moved up to Cobar line
