<p>3<br/>of the famous Cloth Hall, and the splendid old cathedral.<br/>'Flash' _ 'Bang' _ 'Cr-r-rack' Suddenly two of our guns have fired from their debris-covered hiding places somewhere on the other side of the cathedral.<br/>For a moment the pink and vermilion of their flash forms a beautiful background to the ruins which leap us it were from the darkness into momentary existence.</p>
<p>The shells surge through the air above us towards the enemy, with a sound as of two swift flowing narrow streams of water.</p>
<p>Then darkness as before and those portions of the ruins which are [indecipherable] on the silver of the sky.</p>
<p>Nothing more.<br/>Flash, flash, flash<br/>Bang Crrrack &ndash; Crrrack &ndash;<br/>more hidden guns have fired again the beautiful background to the ruins, but brighter, grander again the leaping forth of ruin masses.<br/>Again the darkness and the music augments on the silver of the sky</p>
