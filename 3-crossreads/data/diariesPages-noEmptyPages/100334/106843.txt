examined our each man for skin or Venereal Disease and our name ticked off a list and then in under Hot Showers with plenty of Soap, were we all had a good wash and coming out we received a Towel and then on giving our Number, we received our Boots, and a Sea Kit Bag containing a Flannel, Shirt, Drawers, and Sox's, and then along came our Uniform from the Fumigator, and once dressed we went out and handed our Number at a Window and received our Bag of Valuables handing back the bag when empty, the whole process taking about  an hour, no waiting, no delay, and bustling, all working together like a piece of Machinery, which gave us all a good impression and opened our eyes at the number of Men handled so quick. After Tea we had to parade and March over with our Kit's to No 1 A.B.D. Camp where 26 Men were put into Bow Hut and three Blankets supplied to each man. As there were a large number of Men in this Camp, word came along during the Evening for us to parade at 8 am for Breakfast, 2nd Sitting.
