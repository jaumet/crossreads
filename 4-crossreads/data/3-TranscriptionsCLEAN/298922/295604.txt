Thursday 1st November 1917
91 Lord St. between 10 & 12.30 a.m. ask for Lt. Findlay.
Dolly of course did not get any rest as an anti aircraft gun was outside the Hotel. Had lunch at the Carlton with Mrs. Nevil of N. & F. Mulberrygong then called on Col. Murdock Red +. To "Arlette" in the evening with Mrs. Burgess of SHAFTESBURY.
Raids do not affect the pleasure loving public & every theatre was crowded. We were lucky in getting a TAXI home - Dolly smudged Mrs. -
