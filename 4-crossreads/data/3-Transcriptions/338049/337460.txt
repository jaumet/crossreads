<p>Saturday 7 Sept.<br/>Things easy for a while then moved off immediately to past Peronne which is knocked about thoroughly. Then ordered out on 11th Bde line to Tincourt. Went well until cable ran out.</p>
<p>Waited about for cable to arrive. Officers "forgot" it. Harrassingly shelled. Rough time. Finally cable arrived. Commenced work but shelling put us to flight. Henderson severely knocked.</p>
<p>Finally finished line returned home. Put up camp.</p>
