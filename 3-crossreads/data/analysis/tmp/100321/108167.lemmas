 4/2/19 Gourdinn More snow this morn . I went round the billet we are give to the 23rd . with Hugh . Just befor lunch they march in and were soon settl down . Jack and Beith came and had lunch with me . Latest rumour seem to indic that our next draft will be postpon . After lunch I had the greatest difficulti in tear myself away from a good fire and go out for a walk . With a climat such as this I do n't wonder that the Belgian lead such a veri sedentari life . Took a half an hour stroll along snow cover road and over snow carpet field . Thin powderi flake keep gentl drift down . Spent the even read until 9.30 and then had a yarn with the Crochelet famili .
