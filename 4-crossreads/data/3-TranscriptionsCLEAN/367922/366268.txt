5.little woman, hurts me dreadfully & adds greatly to my grief & infinite regrets. How cruel circumstances have been. Had Mother received my first letters, full of loving thoughts & my regret for the pain I'd caused her to suffer it they might have helped her to survive the illness & then my letters & parcels would have followed quickly to interest & comfort her.
Mum struggled bravely but it was the first two newsless dreadful months that crushed her, & within a little week of my first letter. As you say, you knew quite well the great love there was between us, & you will understand how it causes me unutterable grief
