<p>13/7/19 Chemnitz<br/>Sunday and a hot one. We are going through a deep blue sea its wave crests dancing in a bright sun. Padres Fox and Ash held church parades &ndash; the latter I attended feeling rather queer before it was finished. Retired to bed before lunch and went back again after. It was hot enough today for the wear of light tunic. Several other officers down with sore throats. The S.M.O Marshall operated on a chap this afternoon. He had poisoned his foot through rubbing crude winch oil into a cut. On the promenade deck after dinner had a talk to Capt. Young. The British seafaring man is a fine product very different to their effeminate landsmen. In bed at 7 and called in Dr. Marshall. Temperature 102 and feeling very ill.</p>
