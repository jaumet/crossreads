12/9/18 Cappy
Another threatening day. Formed up the Battalion for parade and practised the General Salute with the Band. The rain then came down and put a stopper on the show. Let all the men go back to their "bivvies" and arranged some form of gas inspection but the morning was wasted. The afternoon like others lately was fine. The companies were at games. "C" Coy had a competition for the best turned out platoon and were very keen. It was a good smart turnout altogether and we decided on No 12 as first with 10 second. Towards evening we had a sunny hour or two. After mess walked out for a while in the twilight but another shower (the prelude to a wet evening) forced me home to my little room half above half underground. It will flood in winter time.
