 People in writing about Egypt always put ins an account of the wonderful ways vultures have of appearing from nowhere, when any animal dies out in the desert. But my experience is that vultures are not in the same street with the waiters in these Upper Egypt Hotels. Whilst you are staying at the pub you hardly see a waiter the whole time you are there, and certainly there is never one within miles if ever you want anything done but  an  just before leaving as you walk out through the main hall you see douzens of them all lined and just waiting to pounce on you. Of course they dont ask for Buckseech straight out, but each one holds out his hand palm upwards and keeps saying Good bye in such a loud voice that you jolly well have to give them something to stop them drawing the attention of the whole darned town on to you. If I write much more I&#39;ll have to send this by parcel post so I&#39;ll tell you about Assuan&nbsp;later on Mother. No more mail in since I left Port Said, but a big one is expected soon. Love to Father, &amp; Hal &amp; Fred &amp; yourself
