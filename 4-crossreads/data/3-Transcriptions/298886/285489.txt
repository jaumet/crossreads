<p>Not too much dust and fairly cool. I have been in the Regimental office the whole day copying out a list of casualties which have occurred since the 12th May 1915. I filled 10 pages of foolscap written closely on both sides of the paper. The Base Post Office wanted it for some insane reason. The idea I think was for the redirection of correspondence to men who are absent from the regiment, and who have been absent from the regiment now for about 11 months &ndash; wounded, sick, and malingering. Hundreds have gone to England and Australia hundreds are floating around in all odd corners of the globe anywhere &amp; everywhere  a good percentage genuinely wounded and crippled  a good percentage genuinely sick, and a fair proportion neither but are well known to be downwrought loafers. and I could with about an hours work with the pen enumerate them  I may perhaps have the luck some day to be behind them when they are in the midst of some stirring narrative <strike>as</strike> about when they got "wounded" on Gallipoli (no one will admit that he was sick). However let them go for now.</p>
<p>Volunteers were called today for men who are tradesmen to form an Engineer Company to be attached to our Brigade about 25 men were selected</p>
