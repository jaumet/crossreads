  
  30 /6/17 (?) Appear to have gone wrong a day somehow as several have remarked tomorrow is 1st. July & being the anniversary of offensive some bombardment is looked for. Morning devoted to cleaning and draining camp medical inspection, rifle, clothes & boot overhauling covering helmets with sacking [indecipherable] All the morning the Band played selections. Afternoon drill and specialist training. Summoned to BdeHQ at 3p.m. to a conference   the General doing a severe strafe over some quashed Court Martials. Returned to camp had a rest and then walked via Riencourt to Bancourt to see a platoon of the 48th. Divn carry out an attack. About 200-300 officers there mostly English & two Major Generals both in their dotage - old, old men who should be at home. Our G. (Smyth, with his V.C. and 3 rows looked a live wire. The practice was well done by the Tommies. Returned to Camp and, after mess, Penna gave an excellent lecture on Consolidation. During the evening Leon Barbier of the Mission Francaise came in and we discoursed at length and read the "Petit Parisien".
