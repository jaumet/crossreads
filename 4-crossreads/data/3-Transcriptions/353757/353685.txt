<p>It is a very cosmopolitan place.  The Egyptian, for the most part is a filthy lousy poxed up bag of bones, stinks like a camel, &amp; great in the art of theft.  We are having a rough time here but aren't we treated well?  Didn't Gen. Reid visit us &amp; say today we were true Australians?  By the way, one amusing episode, one of hundreds here, is worth recounting.  The Officer, the other day came along the rank to inspect the faces before him.  If you don't shave every day you get pack drill or C.B.  Said this officer to a private "Ha ha, no shave!"  The answer was:-  "He He, no fucking razor".  He got the pack drill &amp; worse.</p>
<p>To show the poxed up condition of the community &amp; Australian Soldiers included I attach a notice each man has to carry with him.  They have a tub of Condy's at the gate, &amp; each man, whether he has been whoring or not, has to go through this formula.  There are a lot here with doses also crabs, which latter are of a most vicious &amp; hungry nature.</p>
