  
 The work is well in hand, and looks magnificent. 
 9th May 
 Selecting negatives and arranging pictures with L.ieut Leist. 
 Leist has been for borne time assisting in producing the pictures whilst I was away in Palestin. Bought a bracelet from Stewart Dawson for Tony 57.10 
 10th May 
 To Australia House where I now have office and with Leist arranging prints for the coming exhibition. The work is extremely tedious as I have such an abundance of subjects and find great difficulty in selection. Cold continues to incapacitate my voice which embarrasses me greatly.
