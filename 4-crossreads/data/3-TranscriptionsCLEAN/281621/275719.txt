  
 Sunday 7 Move back to Dickebush for next 24 hours. The weather is awful, wet, & the conditions up the line must be worse than previously. 
 Monday 8 Spend day at Dickebush & tonight we move up to Westhoek tunnell. We are due for a stunt in the morning but the more important part of it is on our left to the sea. 
 Tuesday 9 The result of this mornings stunt is successful. The artillery on our side is very active but Fritz is comparatively silent. In a great air duel one Fritz decended in flames & one of ours came down. The airman came through our post but was dead. From the artillery just now 6 p.m. a counter attack is in progress. 
 Wednesday 10 Move back to about 4 Kilos north of  Poperinghe. What is exactly in the wind I know not but rumour has it that we move from this area. The Australian part of this last stunt was a great success & now all the high ridge commanding all the surrounding country is in our hands. The treatment the 1st Field meets out to its men is anything than a credit to the unit regards food, clothes & general. 
 Thursday 11 The weather we are now having gives evidence of the rapid approach of winter, raining off & on daily. Visit Poperinghe & see Eric Greenwell. Poperinghe is much the same as last year but in darkness. Enemy aerial activity 
 Saturday 13 Visit Rininghilst. Weather still wet & miserable
