<p>is going to Brussels &amp; Antwerp if I can finance the trip which is doubtful as my book has just had a severe strain.  I hope you do not mind my sending all my home correspondence to you.  The reason is that I dont know whether my Mother is likely to leave Fairfield or not &amp; dont want to lose some of the things I send home.  Well Bon soir with love to all from your affect nephew<br/>Walter</p>
