 To the enliven strain of the Band the column move off at about twenti minut to seven . What a differ the Band make to a march , the crowd step out like veteran and look fit to march ani where , but , oh , what a contrast to our arriv at Moaska , our second stop . Quit a number of men drop out even in the first mile with sore feet , and general knock up and as the day wore on and it got hotter and hotter and the water bottl got empti , they were drop out by score and were scatter all over the desert . After each spell the band struckup it liveliest tune , but music wo n't heal a man 's sore feet , or quench his thirst and they continu to drop out faster and faster . We were sent out in squad again and did the best we could but our suppli of water was veri limit , , and we could not do much . The hors in the waggon were get knock up , too , so the wagon order got order to carri the men pack for a mile and then put them off . Talk about be hot , I have experienc some hot day in Australia , but here with the sun beat down on the sand , and the fli bite us , it was enough to make one dement . The spell for dinner was veri welcom and our squad just flop down in the shade of a waggon , with our tongu hang out . The forc had by this time lost about a third of it number . I felt sorri for the poor beggar out there in the desert , with no shade of ani descript . It was a great relief to take off our cloth and have a rub down with a towel , to get rid of the stale perspir .
