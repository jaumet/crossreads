the Greeks.They were charging 7 P.T. a bottle for beer I believe & after a number of men were drunk, it was an easy matter for a riot to start.

The ropes were cut & The the affair fell down with the Greeks inside.They were rescued with difficulty.Officers were pelted with broken bottles & stones & isolated mobs smashed
