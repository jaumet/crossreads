 by the time you get this letter, I sincerely hope to be approaching the end of this training work, and hope to be able to get along satisfactorily with my exams:  they must surely want nearly every available man at present. 
 It is rather funny that some of the very best men in the Field Artillery are the last to get to the front:  the reason is that if they know their work well, they are given perhaps a Captaincy, and left in England to train some of the new batteries, for you can understand that the men, as well as the officers, are only chocolate soldiers at present:  then by the time the battery is competant, the Captain will also have improved considerably himself:  for of course the training is miles too short to make officers of anything like the regulars standard. 
 I hope all this shop talk has not bored you, but one gets obsessed with it &ndash; its thoroughly on my nerves, especially as it is nicer to do well than badly. 
 I hope Riverina is prosperous and smiling once more, and that we get a good run of years to par for the war:  With kind regards &amp; good luck to you &amp; john. 
 Ever yours sincerely Jock Ellis
