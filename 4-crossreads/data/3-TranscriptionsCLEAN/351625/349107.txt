 Dear Madam 
 On behalf of the actual recipients I tender my sincere thanks for your very welcome parcels received recently. 
 Unprecedented delay occurred in the receipt of them & also on my part in acknowledging but "better late than never". 
 Our surroundings, conveniences & the weather in this part of Froggy land don't offer many opportunities for correspondence hence
