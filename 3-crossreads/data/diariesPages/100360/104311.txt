Tues Nov 14 Got word tonight that our chaps are holding 2 lines of trenches. Some of our Bearers are bringing the wounded up from the Train to the Tents. They are all very cheerful

Wed. 15. The party working at the station last night returned to Bunk this morning about 5. They were knocked up.

It was jolly hard work & the night was frightfully cold. The rails & sleepers were white with frost. We were kept going solid till about 12.30 then we walked back to Camp. Lorry gave us 2 good nips of Rum, which put a bit of Life into us, otherwise we’d have been frozen.

Thur 16, Issued with shirts, socks, sheepskin vests, a pair of woollen gloves, also sheepskin mittens, so we ought to keep out the cold now alright. I didn’t require a vest as I stuck to the one I was issued with in Egypt. We got back to Camp about 2 this morning, & Kirby lit a fire. We raided the cookhouse & found
