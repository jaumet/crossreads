Organization of Bread Supplies. Accounts Receipts and issues for all Bakeries. British and Australian. I had decided to use an old Australian recipe for Yeast in view of the fact, That the supplies had only Potatoes to draw on. When British Bakeries arrived the master Baker of 11th. who had 20 years service was determined to use his own recipe regardless of the splendid results we achieved. His effort was a complete failure and 26000 rations were condemned. After that instructions were issued that Yeast supplies would be controlled by 13th. A.A.S.C. We were fortunate I suppose as not one Loaf was condemned baked under my instructions during the whole of my service. On one occasion the C/O an Imperial Officer told me I would sure get a D.C.M. as Headquarters had given definite instructions the Australian Baked Bread "only" was to be supplied to Headquarters. I certainly thought on one occasion I would get a G.C.M. as I neglected during a shortage to supply Headquarters for two days. Our A.D.S. was a sport and made a joke of it. As a matter of fact our own Camp was on Biscuit at this time. Some of my charges had a large piece of the Devil in Them. Most of them I suppose, but when it came to a question of loyalty to their comrades in the line, they were very staunch.
