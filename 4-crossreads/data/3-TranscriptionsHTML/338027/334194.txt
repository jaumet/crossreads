<p>Just after we came up from our swim and finished breakfast we were surprised to hear a loud report on rushing out we found that there a was a German Aeroplane overhead and it had dropped a bomb in the very spot where we had been bathing.  he dropped two more without effect although they both landed close to us. Then our warships commenced firing.  he circled around out of range twice then as one of our shots went close he made off.  One of our trawlers was sunk by a floating mine just outside the harbour.  We went for a route march into the country in the morning and enjoyed it then returned to find that we had to shift camp as our tents were wanted by wounded so we were on fatigue all the pm erecting tents etc down next the R.A.M.C.  A pleasant surprise was another big bag of mail. The latest I got seven letters and eight papers, it has been a great week for us.  They have heard in Aust about our lads on April 30th 16 days after the first fight. [?]<br/>Monday, 14 June.<br/>Twenty thousand Scottish reinforcements have arrived at Cape Hellas in Kilts and plaid trousers.  I had a rather exciting adventure to-day, I was told to take four bags of   [indecipherable] the drivers [indecipherable] to the headquarters boat the Aragon.  I left the camp at 4 pm and went over in a Navy pinnace, delivered my charges then had to wait for a boat to take me back, after an hour's wait three chaps from the No 2  S. Hosp arrived in a sailing cockleshell manned by two Greek natives.  At their request I went with them for a trip around the harbour visiting all the transports with reinforcements and meeting a lot we knew.  it was nearly dark when we left the Seane Choan [?] to get back to the jetty, then our troubles started, we were nearly run down by a transport and a destroyer missing the former by a few feet, it was miraculous then a squall got up and the Greeks lost their heads our tiller broke and they let the mainsail go and we were carried right out into the ocean it took us two hours to get home, how we did it I know not, but we were wet through to the skin with spray,   [indecipherable] making for Woffer [?]</p>
