 Dear Ted 
 Your letter to hand a couple of days ago which you wrote Sept 2nd   &  was pleased to hear from you   &  to find you all fairly well leaving me OK you should have received a couple of letters at least from Egypt from me before you wrote that one the mail they went with arrived as I had an answer from one I wrote home   &  two or three elsewhere I also had one from old Alick he said he had a letter from you   &  you had no complaints   &  enjoyed reading it so I answered it right away so I don't suppose I will    not   get another from him for a while as I have not wrote to him much I am sorry but any how he tells me he has a go job
