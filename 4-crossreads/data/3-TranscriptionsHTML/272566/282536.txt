<p>Sunday 1 April</p>
<p>April Fools Day.  A Balloon went up from Villers Au Flos &amp; Fritz immediately flew across and brought it down in flames.  The Airmen came to earth in parachutes.  This is the balloon we saw on the 28th ult.<br/>Connell &amp; I were today ordered to go to the front line with the 55th Batt. for the purpose of ascertaining whether provision has been made out there for bringing wounded away.  There is to be an action tomorrow morning.  We walked all day carrying blankets &amp; passing through these villages:-  Haplincourt,<br/>Breakfast was the only meal we had today.<br/>Returned to Bancourt in the evening and are now quartered in the old church ruins.  All the above named villages are wrecked in a frightful manner.</p>
