The harsh conditions imposed upon us by our German taskmasters in their haste to forge this link in the chain of communication between the Mesopotamia Palestine fighting-fronts their bases of supply, the time taken in the preparation execution of my two attempts to escape my many visits to Hospital, due to attacks of the Fever which was ever-present in Turkish prisoner-of-war camps; all these things hampered me in my attempt to keep a diary.
However I managed to keep two notebooks, in which I jotted down the most important details of my sojourn in Anatolia, with the aid of "Memory's Diary" where the writing is not blurred but very distinct, I am able to fill in the gaps.
The interest evinced, by friends strangers alike, since my return, the constantly recurring questions, suggested to me that this narrative might have a wider interest. Hence this book.
