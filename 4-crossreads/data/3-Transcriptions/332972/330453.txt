<p>German Concentration Camps Holdsworthy March 28th 1918<br/>The Honorable The Acting Minister of Deffence. Melbourne.<br/>Sir. As we haive not yet heard about our request regarding (I) Rollcall (II) Permission to cable to Swiss Legation London Re Consul, Kindly let us Know your decision. In Memo 3 863 you state:: The Departement is in full possession of the facts concerning the disorder . . . that is the recent strike. This is a step in the right direction. But mere Knowledge that the savagery of 1) Depriving Men of Bread meat  &amp;  Water. 2) Of thus goading unarmed Men to breaking point with view to Bloodshed. "is of no use unless the Department deals with those guilty  &amp;  prevents such violation in the future. Five tousend Men are absolutely convinced that the facts, about wich Mr Justice Harvey states "Their does not seem to be any serious disputes", carry on their face the deliberate intent to murder. Surely you do not condone much less aprove of such murderous intend? Do you think that this facts bear any other construction? In the minds  &amp;  hearts <strike>of</strike>  &amp;  memories of 5000 Men these facts will never bear any other interpretation. In the minds  &amp;  hearts  &amp;  memories of 10 million German People, these facts can never bear any other meaning. Thereof the mere admission that you know these facts is, to say the least rather inefficacious. Awaiting your reply I remain Yours faithfully Charles Jerger. Chairman</p>
