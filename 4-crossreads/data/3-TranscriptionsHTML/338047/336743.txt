<p>1918<br/>July 28<br/>and looked in at our old possie. We got this far mostly overland. The trenches were up to our thighs in mud and water in parts, but were mostly knee deep. There had been rain at last and as these trenches had not been built up for a permanent stay, things were sloppy.<br/>[Photograph inserted title "57. Knee Deep in Mud at La Basse Ville. 24.1.18] Mud.<br/>The 29th Bn were in this trench. We went to the front line to the Right Company HQ, and took a sketch of the position that we would have to occupy and laid a new line to it from a big dugout that had been built back along the Communication trench. This was to be Battle HQ. We then returned to Cobar Line. The 29th men were just moving out. Their Sgt Major gave me a big tot of rum. I thought that it was for Bill and me but he said that I could have the lot. It was just a bit too much for me and it took me about an hour to get over it. Bill got the same. We sat in the dugout and waited till our mob turned up about half an hour later</p>
