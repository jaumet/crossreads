<p>My dear Jack,<br/>Got both yours &amp; Clare's letters &amp; glad to see you are more settled than when Clare wrote. Hope you are still all well also the new arrival, &amp; that the job is still holding out well.</p>
<p>This war is going to play old Harry in the next few months though in the long run it looks to be the making of Australia &amp; the Empire generally. Let's hope that in the future we will be buying &amp; selling only English marked goods. No doubt they are putting up a great fight; yet when we think how well prepared they were, it looks as if they must be getting to feel rather disappointed that they are not yet in Paris.</p>
