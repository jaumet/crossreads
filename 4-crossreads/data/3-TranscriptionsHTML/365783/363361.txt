<p>Just before lunch we passed Mocha &ndash; we were a good distance away from the town but with the aid of glasses could make out the curious flat topped houses, the semicircular domes of some of the buildings &amp; the tall lighthouse looking like a big barber's pole with its alternate bands of red &amp; white.  In the afternoon a deck hockey match between the Nos 1 &amp; 2 General Hospitals took place, our hospital being victorious.<br/>On Sunday 10th January we passed the lonely Daedalus lighthouse marking a small shoal in the middle of the Red Sea.  In the early morning of the next day we entered the Gulf of Suez &ndash; land in sight on both sides &ndash; barren &amp; rugged mountain country.   On the starboard side there was a wide stretch of gradually rising sand between the shore &amp; the foot of the mountains.   Each prominent mountain peak that we passed was reckoned by some one or other to be Mount Sinai &ndash; as a matter of fact it is some considerable distance inland &amp; has probably never been seen from the deck of a ship.   At breakfast time the "Maliva" bound for London passed us &ndash; the family of one of our officers was on board her.   I felt quite jealous of him that it was not my folk that were so close instead of his.   We heard that she had mail aboard for us but I do not hope to get any as any letters she may be carrying for me will probably be addressed to London.</p>
