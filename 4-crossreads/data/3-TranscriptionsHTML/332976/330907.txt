<p>August 1917<br/>6th   I have had leave to-day &amp; went to St. Omer, a large town about 12 miles from here.   We had to go to Hazebrouck to catch the train &amp; had a good look around there before it left.   St Omer, although a large place is not very attractive, but the gardens there are very beautiful.<br/>7th   To-day we have been doing some "barrel-piering," &amp; made a couple of "Flying-foxes" during the afternoon.<br/>8th   We had a 5 mile route march this morning, &amp; finished up with squad drill in the afternoon.<br/>9th   Some of Fritz's planes were over last night &amp; several bombs were dropped in the neighbourhood.   A few civilians were killed, but little other damage was done.  To-day, he shelled</p>
