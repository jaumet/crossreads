<p>but don't get downhearted. This will all end soon &amp; things will be alright.</p>
<p>Wait till I come home. You'll be quite surprised the way things are going to go. So cheers. Hope dear old Clare is up to form again. And also all the kids &amp; Al &amp; Ted &amp; all the others. Tell them some day to expect a letter each, but I don't know when.</p>
<p>We are continuously moving &amp; life is fairly strenuous. Our horses are getting What Ho' but they are good stuff &amp; stand well.</p>
<p>Now excuse this note &amp; don't think I'm shelving any questions from your last letter. Fact is I've come out here in such a hurry that I haven't got any of the old letters here.</p>
<p>Now heaps &amp; heaps of love to you all. You'll probably get this long after Xmas but lots of fun &amp; a happy New Year.</p>
<p>Yours gratefully<br/>Bill</p>
<p>(Dont forget that par about Lizzie)</p>
