<p>are almost too lovely to describe for it is the prettiest I have every seen in my life, such a wealth of flowers, glorious dahlias, rose's chrysantheums, pansies &amp; etc abound everywhere while the Rhodendenrons in all their glory of colors are a never to be forgotten sight, such a variety of colors, pink, mauve, blue scarlet cream gold there they are in a bewildering mass of beauty coloring the whole ground, &amp; sending forth a perfume &amp; incense that defies my poor humble pen to describe, I could wander for hours &amp; hours in this magnificent garden, for there is everything to please the eye &amp; sooth the nerves, it is a little bit of heaven, scattered all over the place are lovely big shady trees &amp; birds are singing everywhere</p>
