March 1916
just returned from the Persian Gulf where it had taken a lot of Tommies to. 
On the 24th I was put on ships guard it was very monotonous but at about 11 am. That night we were supposed to have passed a transport which has been torpedoed by the Aleins. At 2 pm the next day we passed the island of Malta very pretty it look too but we did not call in. On the 26th we were all inoculated the following day I was put on Submarine Guard the same afternoon pulled into Toulon Harbour where we stayed till the next morning. We entered the harbour just after dinner it is one of the prettiest places Ive ever seen for you have to pass a big brake water to enter at the land end of the brake water are some fine big building of white stone with red tiled roof big green lawns surrounding them. There is also a township built-on the water edge at the foot of a big mountain on the right hand side when entering. On the left are some more fine buildings at the head of the harbour is a big naval base coaling station. Near where we were tied up was the remains of some sunken vessel it is several feet above the water. Ferry boats were busy running about several other transports French naval boats occupied
