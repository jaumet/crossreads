  
 Here we are again Mother, and this time we are camped right along side a beautiful stream of water - a better one than the Wadi Kell even, and we are all lovely and clean once again. There is nothing much to do here at all so I am spending my time at the dentist as I have a couple of hollow teath, which it is just as well to get fixed up at once. I had a letter from Colin yesterday - he was pleased with the snap I sent him and his mate wanted me to let him have a douzen of the pontoon bridge one but I cant do it as I sent the negative home a few weeks ago. Every body is talking of a new mail coming in in a few days so I'll try and write again as soon as it comes. There is absolutely nothing to write about here. Love to Father and Fred and yourself. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson
