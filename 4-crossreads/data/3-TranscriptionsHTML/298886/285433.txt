<p>I went with some of my men for a ride out to one of the outlying stations about 8 miles. Hogarth of the 11th Light Horse has gone back to rejoin his regiment which is reforming at Heliopolis. He was sorry to leave us but it was General Birdwood's order, or rather promise to the Regiment that if they were ever reformed again they would get all their men back again. Some of them had made themselves here at home here with us and were genuinely sorry to have to go back to an unsettled state which certainly will exist for quite a long while until the regiment gets properly settled down. Hogarth was one of my smartest men and I am sorry to lose him. I shall have to replace him.</p>
<p>The two signallers who are on duty on the phone are sitting in the dark just close to me waiting for a call one is munching chocolate and the other is sitting "mum" I wonder where their thoughts are now! Three men who took signal officers of the 11th Regt into town apparently got "full" they should have returned early today but failed to do so. It is now 9 30 pm and the sergeant of the picquet</p>
