<p>our party.</p>
<p>There was seven battalions in the attack altogether, but the 13th 14th 15th &amp; 16th Battallions which comprise the 4th Australian Infantry Brigade suffered the heaviest casualties. The section that the attack was made on, was the "Hindenberg Line" between Reincourt &amp; Bullecourt.</p>
<p>I estimate the casualties at 2,000 Killed &amp; 14 hundred Prisoners, The Majority of wounded were amongst the Prisoners taken.</p>
<p>This attack was always known as the Bullecourt blunder amongst the men. But with good management  it would have come off alright &amp; not one twentieth of the casualties would have occurred.</p>
<p>The reason why the Tanks failed us, was through the lack of artillery support. The Tanks given a proper chance are the best wepons that have been used in this war to work with the Infantry.</p>
