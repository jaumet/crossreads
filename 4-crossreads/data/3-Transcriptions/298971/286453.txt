<p>the night.  Still raining &amp; miserable out.</p>
<p>4th November (Saturday)</p>
<p>At 9 am a relief from the 6th F. Amb. 2nd Division arrived and we were quite merry over the thought that we would be leaving the Somme.  Our Amb. is now working in the 2nd Division after having done its share with the 5th.  Both the other ambulances have left.  On arrival at Green Dump orders for leaving at 2 pm were cancelled and sub. by orders to prepare for action again tomorrow if the 5th F. Amb. do not arrive tonight.</p>
