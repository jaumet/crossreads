Tuesday 3rd
Another wet day. Trenches very muddy. They made a terrific din with trench mortar last night and Fritz sent a big lot of "mumies" over, but we didn't have a single casualty. There is a crowd of Frenchmen making drains near our dugout a number of shells burst in among them and it was quite amusing to see them duck. Quiet day, only one case to take in and him sick. Played 1/2d poker after tea. 
Wednesday 4th
24 N.F. changed over again today with the 26th They livened Fritz up with their machine guns. Had Roast beef and baked potatoes for dinner, which is not too bad for Trench fare. No bloomin? mail in yet, we are beginning to wonder where it is.
 
Thursday 5th
Snowy Hunt and his party went for a bath today to Armentieres. Fritz bombarded the town very heavily, but did very little damage, only injured a few civilians.
Gas Alarm. Thursday 5th
Glory ?Hallelujah? Mail came in at last Got 2 letters from Lill and 1 from France. There is a chap named Foster in the 26th N.F. who comes from Stoke-on-Trent. I have had several interesting yarns with him about Stone. We took him into hospital tonight suffering from Malaria, which he got in the Islands. On our way back we found that there was Gas Alarm so of course fixed on our Helmets, OUR chaps sent the gas over, but we also had to wear our Helmets in cast the wind changed and blew it back on us. This is the first Gas Attack we have been through and was quite the funniest experience we have had for a long time. We could see the Gas going over quite distinctly when the star shells burst. Fritz evidently expected the gas, as he sent up about ten times more star shells than he does usually and the place was almost as light as day.
