18-5-16through fine loose sand, & our horses had had quite enough when we arrived out alongside the 2nd Brigade.  the horses were very thirsty as it was about 11 oclock when we got here & it was very hot travelling through the sand but they did not drink much water as it is quite salty from these wells & only just drinkable;
We put the horse lines down had dinner & few minutes sleep under the saddle blankets for a shade & then set to work to erect the tent & put the camp ship shape;  We were issued with a bottle of fresh water each this afternoon & it is quite a treat after what we have been drinking since we arrived;  The Interpreters were going to be left behind at Minia but the H.Q. Interpreter is a bit of hard doer & is out for adventure & asked to be allowed to come with us, so both the others had to come also
