been in, in all my travels in France as I found out after.
The people themselves were a picturethemself to look at, as they were very clean, and also pretty.
Nealy everybody kept an estaminer that is a place where you can get beer lollies and buscuits in fact you can get anything you want.  This village was a place called Eblingham which we stayed at for about three week's, we got a move on one morning in April just as we were beginning to know the place.  Our next place of call was a place called Meteren which was about 14 miles away, and which we knew was every inch of it as we had to march there, on the cobbles, and as it was a very hot day we feelt it very much as we have to carry our full pack's and blanket's.
