<p>case, it is usually one shell only which causes the trouble.&nbsp; Of</p>
<p>course a great deal depends upon the nervous state of the man at</p>
<p>the time but if a shell explodes immediately in front of him so</p>
<p>that the red flame or flash is right in his eyes it seems in many</p>
<p>cases that the recollection of the sight of that flash is passed</p>
<p>on from the eyes to the brain and thence to the nervous system.</p>
<p>The effect is more pronounced if the same explosion killed a couple</p>
<p>of men alongside.&nbsp; A man might have his back turned on a shell</p>
<p>which blew several men to bits and spared him by some miracle and</p>
<p>he would not turn a hair:&nbsp; it seems a recognised thing that he</p>
<p>must get that flash into his brain through his eye.&nbsp; The effect</p>
<p>of shell shock is to make a man shake all over.&nbsp; He cannot rest</p>
<p>and any sudden noise such as the dropping of a mess tin will make</p>
<p>him jump.&nbsp; I have seen a couple of cases of the sort in the</p>
<p>trenches, men who were as cool as cucumbers, men who had been</p>
<p>exposed to any amount of shell fire both here and in Gallipoli.</p>
<p>A week or two back behind the lines has generally fixed them up</p>
<p>but of course some are never able to face it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;No Man&#39;s Land&quot; which is the space between</p>
<p>the opposing front lines is always a place of interest and</p>
<p>excursions out there at night are tinged with a certain amount of</p>
<p>adventure.&nbsp; Just where we have been the lines are from 300 to</p>
<p>400 yards apart and the intervening land is quite flat with a</p>
<p>bit of a stream running parallel to the trenches.&nbsp; For some</p>
<p>distance out from the front line each side has a barbed wire</p>
<p>entanglement designed to prevent surprise attacks.&nbsp; This wire is</p>
<p>constantly being damaged by shell and mortar fire and as fast as</p>
<p>it is destroyed it must be repaired.&nbsp; Consequently parties set</p>
