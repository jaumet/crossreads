  
 you too badly, you will be feeling excited at being so near home & how glad you will all be to be there again together.  Send me a line when you have time.  I know you will be frightfully busy for a time after you get back. Very kind regards to the Major and with love for yourself & bairns in which Mer. joins. 
 Yours affec. Hennie Fletcher 
 P.S. Mer. & your brother were in to dinner to-night, it was so good having them;  your brother is off with a batch of orderlies & medical men to the Dardanelles in the morning as a stretcher bearer.  We hear they are in need of 500.  Why was'nt I a man?  He is so very pleased to be going.  I have taken the liberty to tell my brother-in-law to ring you up for news of us.  Grandma is nearly eighty and as only son of her eldest son, Mer. is almost the light of her eyes.
