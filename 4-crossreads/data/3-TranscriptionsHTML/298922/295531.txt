<p>Thursday 9 August 1917</p>
<p>Am hunting up VIVIAN PRICE's grave, he died here &amp; I hope to get a photo to send to the MILLS family. Left Ernie Armstrong of GUNBAR in the Hospital in Cairo . He is a full blown trooper &amp; has RHEUMATISM. A moist heat here like Sydney &amp; it does not agree with me. Am sending you some little water colours done by an Arabian Artist here. They want mounting.</p>
