<p>Wednesday 21 June 1916<br/>A good deal of "straffing" with artillery during the night. A beautiful day &amp; fairly quiet. In the morning I happened to catch sight of a small working party of Germans our side of their parapet &amp; got the trench mortars on to them. There was a pretty violent cannonade during the afternoon on our right. Capt. Herrod's birthday, &amp; Father Macaullife came to lunch. In the evening there was a very pretty sight, four of our battle planes sailing over us on their journey home : at the time there were no less than 9 planes up, 7 of ours &amp; 2 of theirs.</p>
