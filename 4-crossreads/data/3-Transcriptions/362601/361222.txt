<p>20 June, Friday</p>
<p>F.<br/>English lesson in morning. I read all day. We have Book-keeping in afternoon. I get the problem right but no one else. I read all day &amp; night &amp; go to bed early. All the plates slide down the table. It is impossible to enjoy a meal.</p>
<p>21 June, Saturday</p>
<p>F.<br/>The boat gets a horrible list to port. I get pushed from pillar to post &amp; do nothing all morning. Jack &amp; I play cards on deck. I write all afternoon &amp; night others read a little. Lights go out &amp; boys sing. We have preserved ginger for Tea. We roll about a lot. Watch lovely sunset.</p>
