so I am afraid that the wet weather is on us in earnest now.  It is unfortunate.  I had hoped that we would be back at Wadi Hinane before where the other two Bgdes. have made what appears to be a permanent camp, before the rain came.
Now there is every probability of an unpleasant wet trek in front of us over two ranges of mountains before we can get settled down & watertight.
Suiweileh, 25.10.18What a wonderful Prophet I am.  We moved today directly it started to rain & are now faced with the pleasant prospect of a wet dreary trek right to Beisan which is where we are heading I believe.  And so well a fervent prayer for good weather, to bed.
