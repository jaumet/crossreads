November 1916

It was fairly late that morning when we got back to our support line & we were all tired & fatigued & had a well earned rest. It was while in this line that we witnessed one of our aeroplanes set on fire by two Alien planes & although desasterous was a great sight. During the afternoon of the 5th & also the night our own heavy artillery were too short in range & our platoon which held the front line suffered severly by it. That night our platoon had to go on fatigue to the front line to clear out the trench which had been filled in by artillery & on finishing had to remain in line till stand to next morning.

During the morning of the 6th we got the order to pack up & were releived by "B" Coy & we went back to reserves where we passed the night. Next morning I had to go & look at the dug outs etc in second reserves & later in the morning were releived by the 11th Battalion & we moved back to second reserves where we stayed for several days. Throughout our stay in the trenches our rations were brought up by pack horses & also the small artillery ammunition was carried the same way. Another great thing is that our railway goes within four miles of the front line & keeps a lot of traffic off the roads. During our stay in second reserve trench air duels
