<p>1915<br/>Nov. 26 Fri.<br/>The Egyptians (or Arabs as they should be called) are a very poor race.<br/>I always have a mistrust of &amp; dislike for "Gippies". They have no backbone at all &amp; are sly &amp; cunning. Guess their army would not win many "scraps" &amp; the Gippy soldier is always on the lookout to "hum" feloos off one of us.  The lower classes are more like animals - running about in filthy rags &amp; living in smelly little mud hovels - the poultry living on the roof of the latter &amp; the domestic animals (if any) occupying portion of the "Mansion".</p>
