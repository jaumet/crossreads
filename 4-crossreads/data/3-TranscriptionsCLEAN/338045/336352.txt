Nov 14th Tuesday
Misty & cold day. Very glad am not in camp or at the front. Still waiting for a letter from home. A few games of billiards & usual resting about. Another good concert by Welsh Guards, who are in camp near here.
Nov 15th Wednesday
Beautiful day, first sunshine. Very little to do by eat, sleep, & be merry. No further news as to what is likely to happen. Horrible concert by some amateurs.
Nov 16th - Thursday
After so long waiting the long envelope arrives
