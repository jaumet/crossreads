  
 Nothing else of any importance transpired so will set to & write some letters 
 1.2.16 Had a very busy day numbering & fixing harness in order to be ready to meet  all  anything that may come along. Oscar Josephson came along to see me to-day & I was very pleased to see him. Rupert Josephsons Regiment moves down to Tel-el-Kebir to-morrow so I will have to say good bye to him which I hate to have to do, as it may prove impossible to get him transferred to this Company. I am going into Cairo to-morrow night with O.J. & will have a good time as it is the first time I have  not  been in for some time. 
 2.2.16 Went into Cairo & had a nice evening. Heard that the Persic was rumoured in Sydney to have been sunk.  If I do not soon get some Letters I will send another Cable.  I returned to camp with R Josephson & Oscar Josephson at 10 pm & had some trouble with a man on Guard (Allen.)   I had to put him in the Motor Car, take him to the Dr in the 5th Training Bat..
