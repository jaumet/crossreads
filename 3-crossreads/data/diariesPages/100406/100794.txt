as hard and dry as sand, it makes a crunching noise like sand too. It is impossible to make snowballs with it.

For the last few days the Tommies have been using explosives to break up the Ice as it forms near the place where they are building the Bridge. I tried sliding today with very indifferent success, found a few Marble quarries on the other side of the River (St. Anne's Marble). Seen a number of kids with little sleds and driving them along with steel spikes one in each hand. They got along at a fair pace. The School is not doing well. We have tons of Dynamos, motors, etc. installed but the only prime movers are a Traction Engine about 30 or 40 H.P. and a portable Engine of about 8 H.P. The severe cold has frozen the water pipes so that most of the time these two Units are out of action, they also break down periodically.
The chief industry of this part of the country just now is scrounging wood. Every other person one sees is pushing a barrow load of wood. The wrecked houses, Factories sheds up the River are being taken away
