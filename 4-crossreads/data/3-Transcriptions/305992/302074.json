<p>14.10.18<br/>6 am we passed [blank] &amp; [blank] &amp; steamed out of the Persian Gulf into the Gulf of Oman. Still warm &amp; very oppressive. Temperature 91&deg; during the day &amp; 90&deg; at night. No wind, calm &amp; the sea like glass. The troops drilled physicial &amp; rife &amp; machine gun drill each battalion has 16 Lewis machine guns. They are capable of firing 140 rounds a minute manned by 6 Indians &amp; proved very effective.<br/>A robbery being committed on board during last night. One of our ships quartermasters lost &pound;29 in notes from his room &amp; a able seaman &pound;8. No trace of the culprit. Inquiries fruitless having so many thousands on board. Another boiler lit &amp; the speed increased to 12 &frac12; knots on account of being 12 days steaming</p>
