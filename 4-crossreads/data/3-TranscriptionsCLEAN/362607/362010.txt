Bulford16.2.18Dear Mum,Just a few lines while I have the chance. I expect Norm Keirle over tomorrow & I may not get the chance. I am Relieving the Night Corporal so that he may go to the theatre. I have had another busy week. I went to the theatre 3 times. I saw Sir Frank & Lady Benson in "the Taming of the Shrew", "The Merry Wives of Windsor" & "The Merchant of Venice. They were fine & the latter in particular. Ellis, Dave Williams & myself went to the latter together. I went over to Hudscott on Thursday on Duty. I had to take a chap over there to be boarded for Aussie. Strange to say he was the S/Sgt. Major Imperial Man, who first gave me "Pick 'Im up" in Warwick Farm. I met Reg. Keirle & we had supper together & a long yarn. It was a 4 mile walk back to the Station so I would not venture. I met a chap that was at the Ball in Salisbury & he fixed me up with a lovely meal. Then I got myself sleeping quarters & a bed & blankets. Of course we all talked about Aussie & where we would like to be. One chap wanted Burwood.  See No 2    Harry
