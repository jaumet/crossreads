<p>Sept 1916<br/>13th/20 &ndash; On 15th given another stripe, temporarily. Brass will come in handy. Probably last &amp; be confirmed later. Time to talk then!!! Had a dispensary made of palm leaves etc. Great improvements on bell tent. Cooler &amp; much more rooms.<br/>20th &ndash; Bob T left for Port Said for canteen goods etc. News of further good victories for Allies all fronts. Newspapers straggling in. Another mail expected shortly.<br/>20/29th &ndash; mail came in dribs &amp; drabs of papers, no letters till about 26th. Everyone grumbling at it. Rumours of all sorts flying round. On 29th at 7am Bde moved off &amp; we arrived at Romani about 4.30pm. We came via Qatia, bde followed railway. Collected what would probably be our last feeds of dates from Qatia. Fine dates. Oghratina fairly well stripped of them. Palm leaves also stripped from other hods. Road-making purposes.<br/>20/30th &ndash; Took up 1st L.H.F.A. camp. Very dirty. Understand, some of 1st L.H.F.A. remained to strike their tents &amp; clean up their camp.<br/>Octr 1916<br/>1/6th &ndash; Morning of 2nd left Romani. Mobile Section going <strike>overland</strike> on camel &amp; remainder by rail. Did not leave till 8.30 &amp; it was 5.15 on arriving at Hill 70. Gen'l Chauvel gave lecture on 1st &amp; gave D.C.M. to Lt Finley on 7th L.H. earned on peninsula. Chauvel seems to be getting very unpopular &amp; becoming Tommy-ised which troops do not like. Everyone against Hill 70. 1st went to swing bridge Kantara &amp; getting leave to <strike>City Beach</strike> Sidi Bishr Alex'da. Long while in getting fixed up. Given Operating tent &amp; eventually an E.P. S.S. Wilkinson returned. All sorts rumours &amp; counter rumours</p>
