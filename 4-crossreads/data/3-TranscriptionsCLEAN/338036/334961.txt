ZONNEBEKE[30th Sept. contd]consequently two were wounded & on calling for stretcherbearers I went across & got them & took them to the Dressing Station after applying a field dressing.  Forgot to mention that the ground we were walking over was only captured a few days ago and the stench of dead bodies was overwhelming.  Plenty of horses too. From our pill box we could see Zonnebeke quite plainly & the also the ridge which was to be our next objective.  On our right was Westock & Polygon Wood also.
We were situated on the ridge opp Zonnebeke & there were pill boxes all along the sky & of course he had a nasty habit of shelling them.  The night was moonlight & that assisted us considerably.  At about 4 am distress signals went up & soon our guns & Fritzs too were hammering away like billeo  Probably a counter attack.  At 7.30 we put up a special try [?] out barrage & it was great to witness.
OCTOBERMonday 1stSam was in a larger size pill box dug out nicely finished off & with electric fittings.  At about 11 oclock I went down to Lone Wood for a doze as things had quietened down a bit.
