they started us playing games & etc, this kept things lively & moving until it started to rain & then we all took cover under an old tarpaulin shed, & in here were a lot of German prisoners taking shelter from the heavy falling rain, while in here we started a singing competition this caused a bit of amusement for there was a prize of 10 francs to the winner & this little bait caught a good few. About 12 oclock as it was still raining they called the stunt off & marched home & just about got wet30th Had a nice little mornings work "Outpost Company" this a quiet & decent little job.Rained heavily last night but it cleared up again by dinner
