grimy this is of course on account of the tremendous amount of coal that is handled here for all parts of the world. I have put up at the Railway Hotel, 6/- bed breakfast seems a nice quiet little place very clean, it is now 11.30 I have been round the town have returned am now sitting in my bedroom scribbling these few lines before retiring
17th. Here I am hard at it again buts its only a little after eleven tonight, a West Australian chap I have been knocking about all day, it was raining a treat about breakfast time this morning but thank heaven she cleared up about 11 oclock, during the morning we knocked about the town went in had a look at a Wax Work show, there are some horrible things in there alright, enough to make a man sick
