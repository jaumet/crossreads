April 191716th   We were on roads again yesterday & today.   This morning we were up near Bapaume & at about 10 a.m. we were recalled, & the whole section went out to the other side of Villers-au-Floss with "battle order" & shovels where we had to assist in digging a trench in order to check any big advance on the party of the enemy.   This morning a heavy bombardment was in progress & Fritz counterattacked, capturing three villages & 9 of our "18 pounder" guns.   It was just before the "change over" & as soon as the reliefs came up we attacked & recaptured the guns & villages, & also forced Fritz back about 300 yds past his original front.We came home during the afternoon pretty tired & very wet.   It has been raining all day but shows signs of clearing up towards evening.
