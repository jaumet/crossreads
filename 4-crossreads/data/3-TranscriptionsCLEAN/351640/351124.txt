Just look at the map of Western Russia and Poland, note the long way into Russia that Hindenburg and Makenson have led their armies - almost to Riga in the North, and Kief in the South, while the gallant Servians are squeeze into the South Western Corner of their Mountain fastnesses, Monastir and Prizrend [Prizren].

[Anton Ludwig August von Mackensen (1849-1945), German soldier and Field Marshal, led the successful German, Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian campaign against Serbia in late 1915.]
