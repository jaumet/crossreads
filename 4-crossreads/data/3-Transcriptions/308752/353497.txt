<p>stop for our two days spell at those rotten dugouts again.  It was rather disappointing news as we were al looking forward to returning to our Unit. I jumped on a lorry &amp; went to the Unit on my own accord &amp; enjoyed a splendid hot dinner, a hot bath &amp; a complete change. Certainly a great relief as the clothes I threw away, well I was not on speaking terms with them. I was greatly surprised to see Stan. Hedger at our camp,  he called in to see me &amp; he nearly had convulsions when he caught sight of me. I was mud from head to foot &amp; had quite a beard on my chin,  unfortunately I just missed Oscar Hann,  he called this morning to see Eric &amp; I.</p>
<p>Returned to the dugouts the following day &amp; even here Fritz could not leave us alone in quietness, his airmen must have caught sight of the relieving troops in the town (will be unable to state who they were) &amp; a few big shells came over killing a considerable number. Sgt. Mathieson, Sgt. Morris &amp; Pte. Hall attended to the wounded &amp; deserve much praise for their work. I should have been giving them a hand but I felt queer at the time, one can have too much at this game. I am not the only one who is not up to the mark,  all the other bearers are beginning to break up. Why the nations can't live in peace is a mystery, the whole terrible affair is a disgrace to civilisation but I honestly think that it will be a better world when the struggle is over,  there is a great deal that I would like to state here but I can't &ndash; enough said.</p>
<p>Some of the items I read in the papers are most amusing. Here are a couple &ndash; The Australians after resisting several counter attacks on Tuesday took all their objectives in their stride yesterday. They had hard fighting at ------  where one of them said &ndash; We had great fun &amp; they thoroughly enjoyed flushing the enemy from the "Pill Boxes".</p>
<p>No doubt it was a great victory for the Australians, but as for saying</p>
