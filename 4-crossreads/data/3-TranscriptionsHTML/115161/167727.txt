<p>Oftentimes I would get on a tram and forget the street which I should get off at, resulting in my usually going further than was my original intention, and necessitating a long walk back [handwritten amendment] to my &quot;objective&quot;.</p>

<p>I took a lady friend one evening to a concert in the Albert Hall, she had not been there before, but I had on two or three occasions.&nbsp; Got off the train alright at South Kensington, and from there took the wrong turning, we walked about for more than half an hour in my endeavours to locate this popular building, resulting in her being too tired to appreciate the grand concert.&nbsp; She never complained but she must have thought a lot.</p>

<p>Many other stupid and foolish things happened through my refusal to make enquiries, and my temporary loss of memory.&nbsp; I would never take the trouble to note the names of streets or roads, thereby resulting in my wandering about in localities which were to me strange, and far from the object of my search.</p>

<p>I tremble now to think of what might have been my fate, into what trouble my foolishness might have led me, what idiotic positions I should have been placed in through my own stupidity, what dreadful results might have</p>
