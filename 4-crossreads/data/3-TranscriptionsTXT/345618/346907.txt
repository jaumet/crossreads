A.J.'s farewell
And so you're off to Palestine!Let's drink a cup for auld lang syne &ndash;Gin is the surest anodyneFor every woe.I hope the weather will be fine &ndash;It looks like snow.Sailing's the devil when it's snowingAnd more than half a gale is blowing,For you can't see which way you're goingOr what's ahead;
And any moment &ndash; there's no knowing &ndash;You may be dead!This is not quite the time of yearThat one would choose to volunteerFor foreign service.  It's d-d queerAnd mighty risky &ndash;U boats are always in or nearThat Bay of Biscary.
