 [Note at top of page says leaf of diary missing] Sitting on Court Martial Assuit this is a nice town &amp; Capital of  Upper  Upper Egypt. The Sikh is a hard man to get evidence out of &amp; we will be  hear  here for some days as all evidence has to be taken through an Interpreter &amp; dragged out of ARAB witnesses also.  These are fine looking men &amp; it will be pity to have to Condemn to death such soldiers. We have the use of the main Court House &amp; the seats etc. are crowded with Curious Egyptians come to see this trial by the British, altho' few can understand what is being said.  they seem to take great Interest.  110&deg; today.
