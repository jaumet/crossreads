Thrashing the Russians on one flank, while on two other sides he prevents the Allies from advancing, if he can but give the Bear a little more pummelling he will have but  little  small trouble in downing the other opponents during what will be left of the summer of 1915.   It is not comforting to have to admit this, but every day adds to the self evident fact that both by land and sea the German is winning all along the line, if one but accepts the few yards of trenches that the official wires claim for the French.  Do you notice how grudgingly the Gallic press acknowledge the actions of the British troops, but for whose assistance the protection the German eagles had months since been floating from domes of Paris and the whole country but a German province.  In their illustrated journals the British officers, as high up as Marshall French are depicted as second rate drilled men, it makes me almost angry to look at the pictures.

 4-7-15.   8-40 P.M.   The months wax on and we are on the down grade of the year, as you may note from the date.   By phone I have been advised that there is a letter and a parcel at Gezeirah for me, I have sent Jerome for them and if the former be from you it will be answered tonight, as I like you have my letters posted on Monday that there may be no possibility of their being late for the weekly mail.
