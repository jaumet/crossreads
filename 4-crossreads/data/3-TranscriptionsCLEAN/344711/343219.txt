We went out around the Cinnamon Gardens, the Victoria Fountain, and the different parks and sports grounds.  We saw a fine residence that used to belong to the German Consul, who is now in prison.  In the gardens are banyan, rubber, and bread-fruit trees and cocoa-nut palms. 
 Saw a German spy arrested and marched away under fixed bayonets.  I got caught in a heavy rainstorm but my coolie pulled the hood of the rickshaw up, and kept me fairly dry.  Went back to the ship at 4 p.m., after a very enjoyable day.  The Dutch boat left about dusk, making a fine sight as she turned into the open sea with her decks ablaze with lights, on her way to Java.  Received news of the result of Caulfield Cup, V.R.C. Derby, & Melbourne Cup.
