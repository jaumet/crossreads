the month.  At noon we are lying due west from Cape St. Vincent.
Punching balls, gloves & medicine balls introduced.  The weather hotter & finer and the sea a good deal calmer.
Favourable winds prove most welcome.
During the day I read & much enjoys "Echoes of the War" (J.M. Barrie).
Recite at a "Sing Song" on "A" Deck.
