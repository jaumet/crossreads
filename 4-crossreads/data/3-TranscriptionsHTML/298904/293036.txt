<p>me, after this I was taken up to the bathroom, &amp; had a bonzer hot bath the first for 9 months it was a snifter, I was given a clean suit of linen &amp; taken down to tea, I had a good meal &amp; my arm &amp; leg was dressed, I was then put to bed, theres no one knows what it felt like to be in between clean sheets once more after all the roughing &amp; hardships I had been through. I slept for 12 hours  without waking, for I was pretty tired that day I was put under the X rays &amp; they showed pretty plainly where the pieces of steel were  they were taken out, 2 from my arm &amp; 3 from the leg, it stung</p>
