Dear Old Dod -How are you, you must be well the very opposite to me.
I got a letter from you this morning. I have a swolen gland as well as weak eyes. For any close work like reading and wrighting I have to ware glasses as I [indecipherable] gogles. I had drops in my eyes at first.
Every body is well here. The last few days in bed has been rotten because I could not read.
I must now say good-bye
Good luckAlan
