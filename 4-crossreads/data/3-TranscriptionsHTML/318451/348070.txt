<p>I hope it will be a success, I think it will.  The guns have been fairly quiet but as I write, 10 p.m., there is a rumble of guns, heavy at times.  Capt. McLean called today &amp; Capt. Davidson who has been away with sciatica for 7 or 8 weeks, looked in this afternoon.  I spent the evening working up an address on "Watch Ye" for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sunday Feb. 18th<br/>Today I had 2 services, one at Houplines with C &amp; D Coy who are billeted in an old Brewery.  It was a very good service, the other with A &amp; B in an old Factory near town.  As the men had just come out of the Trenches, the numbers were not quite up to usual.</p>
<p>Monday 19th<br/>Have been at Houplines again today.  The weather is considerably milder &amp; it rains occasionally &amp; things are sloppy.  I had lunch with Capt. Blake &amp; B Coy's Officers, drew pay today.</p>
