as I expected to see one large University it consists of 24 Colleges scattered all over the town.We saw St. Magdalens Christchurch and all Souls etc.  Most of these were built by Wolsey.  We also had a look at the Thames and its tributaries where rowing takes place.It is a lovely place.  Each College has an elaborate houseboat to which the boats are moored while the men change.
