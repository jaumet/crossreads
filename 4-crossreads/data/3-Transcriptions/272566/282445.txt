<p>Tuesday 2 January</p>
<p>Striking a hospital tent in the morning and erecting it again in another part of the grounds.  At 1 p.m. 10 of us went to the famous Caves near Naours where refugees used to hide in times of Invasion.  These Caves contain about 300 rooms, one cave being &frac12; mile long.  A whole Division of troops 20,000 could be accomodated here, horses, artillery etc.  The names of John Norton &amp; Eva Pannett are to be seen autographed on a stone just inside the entrance.  Met "Ginger" Smith from Mosman.</p>
