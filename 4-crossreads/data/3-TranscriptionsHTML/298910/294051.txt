<p>a heavy night carrying thro the mud &amp; slush, the air seemed to be thick with bullets whizzing &ndash; As the road is so dangerous our Ambulance Cars cannot venture further down than the Estaminet &ndash; result all patients have to be carried 4 miles. Fritz dropping H. E. very close to our Aid Post all night, none of us had any sleep.</p>
<p>20/8/16  Sunday</p>
<p>Dull but no rain &ndash; We all went to bed about 5 am after clearing the wounded, about 6.30 am Fritz lobbed over some H. E.; the 2nd one took the cover off our dug out, others riddled our water cart etc &ndash; as we have no decent dug outs we all thought we would be in heaven in time for dinner, after about an hours suspense, he never got us &amp; we started business as usual &ndash; I don't care who the man is this sort of thing unnerves him more especially, when he gets no sleep, that is our biggest trouble.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>21st 1916 Fixed up the Aid Post as well as we could &ndash; Started building a decent dug out &ndash; Fairly quiet &ndash; not many casualtys</p>
