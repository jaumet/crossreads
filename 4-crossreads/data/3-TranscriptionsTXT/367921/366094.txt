regards their interest in us, nothing was done, so that our conversation had to be carried on in whispers.        It would be impossible to describe our joy and feelings at being entertained in a comfortable drawing-room, and to enjoy women's company after the life of isolation and discomfort we had led for some months.        We had some trouble in making ourselves understood at first, but later on our "Platt Deutches" became more easy, but we were never "stuck" for when we did get a trifle mixed we always had the interpreter, who spoke the language like a native, to help us out of difficulties.
