The last shell fell within 60 yards of us. There was a scatter and a shower of earth fell over us. Orders were given to remove all horses out of the stables which we did in quick time & took them half a mile up the road to another stable. As we were going up shells were bursting around many of them being shrapnell shells & bursting high in the air, one very close to the baloon.  A stream of women & children followed us up. We came back for tea leaving a picket with the horses. By this time the schrapnell were bursting short of us falling about Erquingham. He had a balloon up observing his shots. Our big guns are now busy replying and I hear no more of the enemies shells from that direction S. of Armentieres. 
 Tursday June 12. 1917 (1044) Fine & warm to day. There was another terrific bombardment of the enemy by our artillery last night which continued with varying intensity throughout the night. From a point  South of Armentieres Fritz this morning shelled Bailleul with a long range gun; the shells passing right over our stables & billets. He is evidently in search of our aerodrome
