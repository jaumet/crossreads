 3.  the 9.50 A.M. train for London.  Arrived in London we went to Trafalgar Sq. via the Tube &amp; lunched at the Strand Corner House, some place too.  We then Hurried up the Street to Charing Cross &amp; the Train was just moving, so we hopped on.  This Railway is the famous South Eastern &amp; is the slowest &amp; roughest in the Country.  It was just like riding in a Cattle Truck.  On the way down to Dartford the    whi    railroad runs along the Thames for a good way.  It is about half way to Gravesend at the Thames Mouth.  We saw a Caravan City of about 150 Caravans.  I do not Know whether the Tenants were Gipsies or not as all were out of sight.  I saw hundreds of people on this potato planting business, some women &amp; many boys.  Arrived at Dartford we had a mile &amp; half to walk.  We hurried on &amp; I soon got rid of my Patient &amp; caught the 3 pm train back to London.  I saw a British air Ship while at Dartford &amp; tried to take a snap but could not find the thing on the focusing screen.  The train did not arrive back at Charing Cross but at Cannon Street.  I did not know the way back to the Strand so I had to get a Taxi.  I then went out to Edmonton on the Motor Omnibus to try &amp; see Cyril but He had just gone out.  I had to ride back on the Bus again &amp; I can tell You that I had St Vitus Dance for half an hour afterwards.
