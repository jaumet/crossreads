  
 I bought a pretty tray-cloth - but did not have time to buy anymore. Thought it may be useful if not for myself for home - We then went to see St John's Church - The most wonderful church I have ever been in. The paintings are some of the oldest    & best in the world & the marble & other work most interesting.
