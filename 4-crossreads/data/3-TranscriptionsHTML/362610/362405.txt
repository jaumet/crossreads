<p>Saturday 8 July 1916<br/>A rather threatening morning turning into a lovely summer day, distinctly warm in the afternoon. In the morning reported to Bn. H.Q. re my new appointment, &amp; in the afternoon had a company inspection by the Colonel. Austn. mail up to 15 May received at afternoon teatime &amp; specially good. Rode round to Sailly to see whether Leo was still there, word having come thro' that we were to move in the morning. It was a lovely ride, but found that Leo had moved some days previously. Busy in the evening arranging details for move : a particularly lovely sunset. Shaved in order to save time in the morning, &amp; as far as possible got my gear together.</p>
