 JANUARY 1917 
 3 WEDNESDAY 
 Fine, but cold &amp; cloudy. Took the 
 horses all out for walking exercise&nbsp; 
 in the morning while they made 
 new horse lines for them. Fixing up 
 harness &amp; grooming horses in 
 the afternoon. 
 The name of the village we 
 are quartered near is 
 &quot;Strazeele&quot;. Did not hear any 
 guns firing today, but suppose 
 it was because of the wind.
