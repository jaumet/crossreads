Everybody slept in this morning till about 7.30 as we had very little sleep owing to a Gas alarm. Bricky Masom was on picquet from 1 till 2 and he rushed in and woke us all up. We spent the rest of the night in expectation, but nothing came of it. Bathers commenced to arrive about 9. Last night we were allotted to our various jobs. Stan Wright and Frank Woods are M.P. Bert Hunt is issuing clean clothes and taking in dirty ones. "Payney" is looking after the Officers Baths, "Bricky Howard is also in charge of a bath. MacDougall is in the store room with Frank Newton and I am in the Clothes Office, issuing clean tunics and pants. Not a bad job at all, too bloomin? good to last I'm afraid. One big artilleryman came in with his tunic blown to ribbons but he wasn't touched himself. There is not much doing, and we are all having a jolly good time. Alec is doing the cooking, with "Bluey" Stanton as Offsider, so that part of the show is alright.
Saturday 29th
Last night Mac, Alldis and I took a stroll back to our Ld.billet at Enguingham, where we had a beer and a yarn with Madame. She says things are very quiet now, as all the soldiers are in the trenches. Bricky Howrd has been recommended for D.C.M. for hopping over the trenches at Fromelles under heavy fire and rescuing wounded man. 
One meets quite a number of celebrities in these parts. Last night we came in contact with a Serg. in the R.C.A, who has the D.C.M. and also the French Military Cross, and today Serg. Bassett the first N.Zealander to gain the V.C. came in for a bath. He is quite an unassuming little chap, and was a Bank clerk before he enlisted. Snowy Atherton said to him, after he had bathed and dressed "we don't get V.C.'s here every day. Have another Bath". There is a party of N.Z. billeted just behind our baths and last night they were bombing the fish in the canal. Got some beauties too, looked like perch.
