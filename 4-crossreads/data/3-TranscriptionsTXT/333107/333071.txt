 heavy fighting in the Hun's mad endeavour to reach Amiens. Trenches and wire entanglements were everywhere. 
 We marched into Town and were told off to billet in various houses. We, of the Postal Corps, have a Cottage to ourselves. 2 rooms are intact, but the rest of it is badly knocked about. We "set to" and soon made it fairly comfortable. In the kitchen is an enlarged portrait of a smiling little Girl, and lying about the house and yard are several playthings. This kind of thing upsets a man more than any of the front line happenings. 
 The stove is in good working order and we heated pork and beans, and made Tea on it. We got word tonight to report to the P.O. H.Q. tomorrow when we shall be told off what our Jobs are to be. Gee: B.E. &ndash; I do long for you tonight. 
 Tues Aug 27 Last night Harling and I intended to see "the Coo-ees" Concert Party, but when we arrived at the Hall the "House Full" notice was displayed, so we were disappointed. 
 This morning I woke up with fearful pains in the stomach, and went outside, where I had a fit if vomiting and diarrhoea. Gee: it was lively. The pains got worse, so Bert Phegan went round for a 3rd Div A.M.C. chap, who gave me some kind of dope, but it had no effect. As I showed no signs of improvement he got permission from the H.Q. Adj to send me to the 2nd F. Amb in a car. Here I was seen by "M.G. Sutton, Maj" who told me to get between the Blankets, where they administered into me 1&frac12; ozs Ol Ricini [Castor Oil]. This very soon had the desired effect and I was "kept moving" all aft. and night. I put "my funny feeling" down to some rather doubtful salmon I ate for dinner yesterday. 
 The rest of the Postal Party went up near Amiens.
