<p>9th Oct:- Rough weather again but not so bad as before. Not seasick this time. No land in sight  &amp;  we are glad that we are well on the way to Egypt. May we soon reach there.</p>
<p>10th Oct:- Sunday</p>
<p>Still rough  &amp;  windy. The ship rolling a lot. A concert was to have been held to-night, but was postponed owing to the weather</p>
<p>11th Oct:-<br/> <strike>Sunday</strike>.  A little calmer &amp;  getting warmer  Work as usual. The water has been very bad. Half salt  &amp;  hardly drinkable. The tea  &amp;  coffee is awful. Water better to-day. Plum pudding for dinner heavier than lead. Two strong men had a piece on a string  &amp;  managed to drag it round the deck.</p>
