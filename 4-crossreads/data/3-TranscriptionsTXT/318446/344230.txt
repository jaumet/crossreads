 Anzac Police Corps, the latter coming off second best, the alleged reason being that some of the police reported two sisters &ndash; from 14th General for overstaying leave.  They are a low crowd any way &ndash; the Police I mean, most of them can be squared, &amp; a lot of them are the worst cold footed scum of Australia.  I am glad they got it in the neck.  But I believe it means the end of Leave. Heard a faint rumour today of our next move.  Apparently three places to be attacked simultaneously, Infantry to attack Bir Saba &amp; also Gaza &amp; mounted troops to attack some place further south.  The 1st Reg. came in here yesterday, the Yeomanry taking over their camp. We did not go out there after all.
