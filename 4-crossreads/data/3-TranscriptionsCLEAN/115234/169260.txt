  ashing   ashining 
 For us blokes who came 
 overseas 
   
 When the political 
 coves were yapping 
 Win the War - was their 
  eternal wheeze   main  squeeze 
 But twas us  xxxxx   who  
 did the scrappin' 
 Us blokes who came 
 overseas 
   
 When the cold feet guys 
 were sneering 
 Tin soldiers was their 
 wheeze
