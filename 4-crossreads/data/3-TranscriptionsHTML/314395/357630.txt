<p>France<br/>17.9.17</p>
<p>Dear Dad<br/>I am sending you my medal for safe keeping.  I received it yesterday from Gen. Birdwood in Clairmarais Forest, where we are now resting.  (Near St. Omer, Uncle Emil will know it well.)  I am giving it to a mate to despatch from England, which I think will be a safer route.</p>
<p>Your affect. Son<br/>George.</p>
