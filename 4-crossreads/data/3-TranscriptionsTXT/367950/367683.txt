 vegetable &amp; meat rations made hot on the fire, bread, jam, and tea with plenty of milk (Ideal) we cannot complain about rations we get well fed . There are times of course when things are a little "tight" but they are only spasms and we are soldiers and can put up with a little inconvenience now &amp; then. This time tomorrow we shall be about 15 miles nearer "Jacko" and each man (apart from Signallers) in the Brigade is carrying 200 rounds of ammunition. Each man has a spare bandolier full of cartridges around his horses neck. And each Lewis &amp; Maxim gun is carrying 3000 rounds per gun So "Jacko" had better keep out of range. The Signallers by the way only carry 50 rounds as they scarcely ever use any ammunition they having communications to keep up at all times and consequently have no time for shooting and the more fighting there is going on the more messages are going through from the Regiments to Brigade and vice versa and the more important these messages become so where would the commander of a Regiment be if an important message was in course of transmission and the Signaller left his telephone or Heliograph to have a shot at the enemy? And beside the Signallers have to carry heliographs which weigh about 15 lbs and telescopes and stands and flags etc etc
