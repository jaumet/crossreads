<p>finished up with 2 reels so that's not so bad.  I have got 5 on hand now getting ready for my trip home to "Aussie" there's no one has any idea how scarce these things are nowadays nearly the same value as gold.  After dinner I went out to Ilford caught the train at Liverpool St. &amp; was soon in Courtland Avenue where Jessie Alderson lived with her people they have a very fine house fitted with all modern conveniences.  In the evening I telephoned in to the city for 2 seats at the "Kingsway", there is a very fine farce on there "A Weekend" is the name of it.  We had fine seats 13/- each pretty expensive but well worth the money I &amp; for that matter both of us thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  I was sitting next to a little Japanese officer, it was very funny &amp; amusing to hear him talking.  I could just understand him, he is over here on a mission from Japan &amp; seemed a rather nice little chap.</p>
