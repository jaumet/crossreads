<p>1/7/17 Beaulencourt<br/>Lowering skies. Church parade at 10 am with the 21st &amp; 23rd. Battns. General Smythe was there. Lamble preached a good sermon. Men wore drill order and greatcoats and looked well. Pay day today much gambling and two up about the camp &ndash; nothing else fro the chaps to do. Stayed in all the afternoon and did some French exercises. In the evening orders arrived for tomorrow's stunt and took the OCCorps out with me to reconnoitre the ground for our attack. Old German battery positions hereabouts and some of their graves. One grave bordered with aeroplane slats is of a British airman shot down by them. Till 11 p.m. issuing operation order for stunt tomorrow &ndash; a complicated affair of map references, barrage times and other complexities enough to drive one mad &ndash; one of the reasons why the Government pays me 30/-  a day! On the front much flash and roar of guns and all of it is not ours by any means. Tiny Heath was in to afternoon tea having been right forward</p>
