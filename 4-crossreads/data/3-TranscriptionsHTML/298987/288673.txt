<p>examin properly as we wanted to see Cecil Rhodes Home. Took train to Newland &amp; walked to Groote Schuere Fine old fashoned old house. Built when people were not in a hurry set in very fine grounds. Quite a good Zoo. Australia is well represented &amp; the 'Roos etc look very well &amp; have plenty of room. Went on to the Memorial It is some clime but well worth while one sees right down the valley over suburbs part of Town &amp; harbour &amp; out to see. The Memorial is plane &amp; massive with a bronze Bust of Rhodes guarded by two huge lions There was a very takeing little Tearoom behind the Memorial <strike>of</strike> as usual we were hungary but were doubtful if we could finance a feed. Decided to risk it They did us very well &amp; being quite cheap our cash stood the strain. Only have 6d left tonight &amp; it is borrowed</p>
