<p>corpse was draped with a union jack &amp; the officers &amp;men of his Coy on one side of it  &amp; the firing party &amp; buglers on the other side. After the service by the Rev R A Gordon (Chaplain) the firing party fired the salute &amp; the buglers played the "last post" making a very impressive ceremony. My arm was still a bit sore during the day &amp; my wrist has also been troubling me a lot being very week. Slept on deck. No land or ships sighted : Bible class in afternoon : boat stopped during burial</p>
