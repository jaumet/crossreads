<p>Wed. Feb. 27<br/>Wet, squally day.</p>
<p>Very little news in the Papers. Wrote to France and Lizzie Rowley, commenced Letter No 10 to B.E.</p>
<p>Thur. 28<br/>Another month gone. Big day in the Mess. Everything seemed to go wrong. I cleared out and was thinking of resigning my Job, but after thinking the matter over I changed my mind.</p>
<p>It is jolly cold in our Hut. The only place where we can get properly warm is between the blankets.</p>
<p>The "clink" where we sleep has its' walls covered with Sheet Iron, which makes it always cold.</p>
<p>Finished Letter No 10.<br/>[Sketch of a young lady]</p>
