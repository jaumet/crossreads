<p>Isn't this a beautiful old gateway? There are lots of places like this in this City but we did not have time to go and see them. We are having a great time here in Cornwall, such lots of little kids like my two, &amp; that's what I like best, heaps of love &amp; kisses from Dad<br/>XXXXXXXXXX</p>
