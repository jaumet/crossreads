  
 that I can read a person fairly well Nurse Bayliss declares that what I told her is exactly what an old gypsy said some years ago about her, & they all consider I have got uncannily close. 
 9th. Have got a bit of spare time on my hands this morning so I will try & give a description of how a man when wounded is conveyed from the battlefield to Blighty when lucky. 
 The first man we come  in contact with is the Battn or Coy. Stretcher bearer, who paints the wound with iodine & dresses it with a shell dressing if it is a large wound, or with the mans own Field Dressing if a small one, the man is then helped or carried to the Reg. Aid Post, here the man is again dressed by the M.O. & a morphia injection is given in exceptional cases when a mark is made on the patient's forehead
