 Our 'Arbour 
 20/4/19 
 Easter Evening 
 Just eating a buttered bun Aunt Katie sent me. 
 My dear Mother 
 been in the 'Arbour for nearly three days now. Anchored near Watsons bay, and tomorrow we go to North Head for Quarantine till Anzac day; when we are to march (or "drift" I expect it will be) in the precession. We are a 'clean ship" so dont know why we are being kept in, but it seems to be the usual thing. I received yours & Fathers letters of 17th April. Sorry to hear it is still so dry, but glad you are not coming
