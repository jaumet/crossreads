  
 fixed up blankets, rations for 24 hours etc. Took off in Hospital charge for Suez - 26 Isolated cases - 24 Mumps & 4 Cot Cases - My Party moved off with the 14th 2nd Light Horse - to whom we are attached with Lt Trickett in charge - Left Suez at 12.30 - unknown destination - The troop train consisted mostly of 3rs Class Carriages - Our Party were allocated half a carriage & were quite an important body as we were the only 8 Ambulance men on board - luckily we had no cases of accidents etc to attend to. 
 From the time the train started we began to see wonderful sights & Curiositys & the further we went the more we saw - the Lazy Nig & the Energetic Nig - The desert in itself is one big object lesson, together with the must be seen to be believed Irrigation scheme - The Line thro desert is one straight line & very level
