place, say a month or two later than we have done, when the vines and fruit trees were in leaf it would present a very pleasant if not beautiful picture, but as we saw it, with the shroud of winter hardly lifting from it, with its wildernesses of stone walls dividing each small allotment, and surrounded by with the barren sterility of the rocky slopes which encompass it, it looked singularly waste and barren.
On the left, as we passed through, rises on the opposite slope the village of Beit Djalah. This village is entirely Christian, and many fine vineyards and olive orchards surround it. After we had passed a little way out of Bethlehem, we came to the tomb of Rachel, the beloved wife of Jacob, situated on the top of the rise on our left. It is a small simply constructed structure surmounted by a stone cupola. This, I believe has been destroyed, or partially so more than once, and again rebuilt, the latest addition being the closing up of the Arches by the Mohammadens. Then came the Monastry of St. Elias, an ancient edifice crowning a height on the right of the road. This place dates back to 1160 at least but, the Emporer Heraclius founded it long before that date, and restored in 1160 by the Emporer Manuel Comnenus. To the right left of the road is shown the rock where Elias was fed by the angel.
A little further on is Before this Before this comes the a Hospital founded by the Knights of Malta. Shortly afterwards we came in sight of the Holy City. The view is certainly not impressive from this entrance, apart of course from the associations which surround it, for right and left is country rich in historic interest. Just before we come to the Station is the plain of Raphaim on the left, the scene of many Israelitish conflicts. A long, winding, descent leads
