 Darling Mither, 
 There&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve forgotten to mention in my two last letters. &nbsp;I was going to send you an Australia&nbsp;&pound;5 note which I have gotten hold of. I have thought over it and think it is a bit of a risk sending such through the post. &nbsp;But I want you to take&nbsp;&pound;5 from my account for a Christmas Box, and I want you to write and tell me that you have done so. &nbsp;Now, do this, Mither, otherwise I will be very annoyed. I still carry with me in my pocket-book the only wee note I&#39;ve had from you so far, so treat yourself as you wish, and write and tell me you have done so, there&#39;s a Darling.
