<p>Tuesday<br/>28 Nov, 1916<br/>[This page crossed through and marked Cancelled]<br/>Im tired of I's &amp; We's of this journal so am going to introduce a Lance-Jack to its pages,  Woods says "hes not a bad poor ----" but Woods neither knows nor cares, he is a personal friend of mine how ever, &amp; what I dont know about him no one else does, some of his doings are strictly censored of course but if theres any thing worth the telling Ill be in a position to gaurantee the truth of it.  For convenience we'll call the boy Jack, I could never stand those double names so guess he <strike>would</strike> likes them no better than I do</p>
