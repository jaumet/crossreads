I don't care now how soon I get back to France now Len has gone, for theres nothing much of interest to me round here now.
On our way home Lindsay I picked up Bill Graham the 3 of us went in to the 1st T.B. looking for Digby who had just returned from his 6 months leave in Australia, we found him he told us all about his experiences reckons they had a rotten time for the first 6 weeks no one would recognise them, but after they were found out they had a glorious holiday, I am jolly glad I did not get away now for we have our leave in front things will be in running order when we get to Aussie so there will be no delay it was the same when first I came to England on the Cadre last year
