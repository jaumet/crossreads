  
 surprised & pleased at meeting each other. During the week the Night Birds gave another performance which was a success as usual. 
 We have now been out of the Line for a fortnight, enjoying a short period of fitful rest. That is to say we are just beginning to settle down to peace & quiet, after one of thos trying intervals when shells come flying through the air,   Wild rumours circulating round in regards to our movements, that one hardly knows what to believe. The war news during the past fortnight have been glorious, great victories have been gained by the British & French on the Western Front. Every day we hear of thousands of Fritz prisoners being captured, also a large amount of war material, such as heavy guns etc. etc.. Mile by mile each day the Germans are retreating, sometimes leaving many dead & wounded.  It is useless me stating any more on the subject, as the news will be in all the newspapers. The weather to day Tuesday 24th is really beautiful, the route march we have before breakfast each morning in such weather is very pleasant. The last five days have been fine.
