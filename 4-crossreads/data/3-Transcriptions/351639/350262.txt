<p>These groups offered a splendid target to the Colonials when they surged forward to the assault shortly after three am stop  this attack from the top of Monash Gully was repulsed with heavy loss by four am stop  a series of attacks against various points were now delivered being directed with special severity against Quinns and Courtneys posts but these faded away beneath our rifle fire delivered at close range  piles of dead being left in front of the trenches stop</p>
<p>at five am on the nineteenth as soon as it was light the Turks opened up a very heavy bombardment on our trenches the beach and the interior of the position bringing into action twelve inch nine point twos howitzers and field guns and most of the casualties suffered during the action came from this fire for the Turkish rifle fire had little or no effect on the well made trenches stop  from six am until nine thirty am the Turks made a series of desperate attacks against Quinns and Courtneys posts but the Colonial line never yielded <strike>a foot</strike>  and not a Turk, ever set foot inside the trenches although hundreds lie dead within a few yards  some even on edge of the parapet stop</p>
