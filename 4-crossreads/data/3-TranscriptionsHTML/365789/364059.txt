<p>It was while we did so that I noticed a little grey procession coming towards us from the ground out beyond the trench in front of the German lines.  They came very slowly &ndash; the steady even pace of a funeral.  The first was a man, a weather-beaten, square-jawed, rugged old bushman, who marched solemnly, holding a stick in front of him from which hung a flag.  Behind him came two men carrying very tenderly and slowly a stretcher.  By them walked a fourth man with a water-bottle.  They were the stretcher-bearers, bringing in from out there some of the wreckage of the night before.  We went along the trench further, and at a later stage we could see men in the mist in ones and twos out in front of the line.  A rifle or two from somewhere behind the mist were pecking regularly there &ndash; sniping from some German outpost &ndash; and it seemed not wise to show yourself too freely.  The mist was lifting, and you never knew whether the Germans were this side of it or not.  But though those bullets pecked constantly at the small parties of stragglers, the little procession with the flag passed through unharmed.  If the sniper saw them he must have turned his rifle for the moment somewhere else.</p>
<p>We made our way back, when we went, across a hillside literally flayed of all its covering.  The barrage of the night before and of other days had fallen there, and the slope was simply a ploughed field.  I could not get rid of that impression at the time, and it is the only one that I have of it still &ndash; that we were hurrying up a ploughed country side along a little irregular newly-made footpath.  We had come out upon a road, and crossed it at once.  After a second or two of thought one realized that it was a road, because the banks of it ran straight.  It had been like coming on the body of a man without his skin &ndash; it took you some time to realize that this flayed thing was a road at all.</p>
<p>There was a shrapnel shell regularly spitting across that country.  We knew we should have to pass it, and one was naturally anxious to be under cover at the moment.  At this time I noticed on our left a little group of figures faintly seen in the mist attending to some job in the open.  We came in sight of the trench we were making for, and they hailed us, asking the way.  They were standing above the trench intent on some business that needed care when the expected shell whizzed over the hill and burst.  I ducked.</p>
<p>The men standing on the brink above the trench there did not even turn a head to look at it.  Five or six angry pieces hissed by, but they no more heeded them than if it were a schoolboy pelting mud.  They were intent on their business, and nothing else.  They did not ask for a trench to get into, but only to show them the way. Their burden was carried easier over the open.  They were stretcher-bearers.</p>
<p>We started home a good deal later from another part of the line by a short cut.  Five minutes after we had set out the Germans happened to turn on their barrage across a patch where our aged trench seemed certain to lead.  There may not have been more than fifteen shells in the minute, but it seemed, looking along that patch, more like thirty.  They were of all sorts mixed &ndash; ugly black high-explosive shrapnel bursting with the crash of a big shell; little spiteful .1 shells flinging up fountains of it.  We pushed on until the trench petered out, and the shorter shells were already bursting behind us, and the trench was little more than a crater to nip into when you heard them singing towards you, and then we decided to give it up.  At one time, as we dodged back, a visitor came singing so straight that we dived headlong into a crater, just as you would dive into the sea.</p>
<p>A few minutes later we were back in the comfort of a fair trench, perfectly snug, watching the storm.  As we reached that trench and turned into it two men were clambering up on to the bank to join a party of five others who were standing up there already in the open.  They were stooping down to arrange with others the lifting of something up to them.</p>
<p>They were stretcher-bearers &ndash; Australian stretcher-bearers.  The two pairs on the bank</p>
