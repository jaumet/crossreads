TUESDAY, JANUARY 7, 1919.
Fine. Knocking about town
in the morning. Went down &amp;
put in an application for an
early return to Australia at
Horseferry Road in the&nbsp;evening&nbsp;afternoon.
A big mob of us went down to
the Pic for&nbsp;lunch&nbsp;dinner &amp; got
a couple of boxes for the &quot;Boy&quot; after
&amp; had a good evening.
