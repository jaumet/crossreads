<p>Wednesday 18 July 1917</p>
<p>Am afraid our boys are having a hard time in France &amp; we should not grouse here. It is HATS OFF to the Infantry after this War. This climate makes a man very lazy &amp; livery a big long tiring night march, SHELLS, etc. then a day or two in Bivouac. As I used to say in the old days &ndash; "Keep a bit up your sleeve for a Bush Fire". A man never knows when he may be turned out at any hour &ndash; hence we visit other Units very little. <strike>Just heard from Lance that Charlie was back in England slightly wounded in face but nothing serious.</strike></p>
