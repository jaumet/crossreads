It's very green - covered with dense scrub & full of all kinds of black brother. B.B. appears harmless enough & inclined to be friendly to the khaki - from long association with transports (coaling) he has adopted something of a military style & may be seen after hours, strutting roundin khaki riding pants & leggings. Always he carries a highly polished stick. The pants are pinched - the stick comes out of the scrub & is usually crooked & far from light. One thing is very noticeable - B.B. says 'Australian soldier good boy' with great sincerity of expression.  Aus. soldier good boy because he treats B.B. to spare coppers, bread, condensed milk & cigarettes in return for Ju-Ju dances. We had one Ju Ju dance rendered by old Nicks favorite grand child. The biggest & ugliest human being I ever hope to see. Put him on the Tiv. & he'd bring a fortune - if he didn't start a panic. The whites here look on the nigs as so much dirt, but from a physical point of view BB looks the better man - excepting Raffir & Coolie. The up-country natives are easily picked out by their graceful carriage & big limbs. Some of them would be rough customers to handle.
