 Us blokes wot come 
 ___&nbsp;&nbsp; overseas&nbsp;&nbsp; _____ 
 &nbsp; 
 When the bands were 
 loudly blaring 
 And flsgs flung wide 
 to the breeze 
 They cheered our pluck 
 and daring 
 Us blokes who come 
 overseas 
 &nbsp; 
 When the Tabbys the 
 streets were lining 
 Our hands they grabbed 
 and squeezed 
 With love in their eyes
