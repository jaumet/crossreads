 Thursday 28 August 1919 Nice &amp; bright today. Old Botha is dead. Crossed over to the bluff in a ferry &amp; walked a few miles along the beach to a big whaling Coy's cutting up &amp; melting down station. No whales in. Had a look at the place. Nothing in a whale is lost at all. Oil, bones or flesh. Flesh &amp; bones made into manure. Went back to the boat over the hill. Took the sweat out of us too. After lunch went into town &amp; down to the beach. Had one or two ices. Did some shopping &amp; then came back to the boat. It had moved over to the coaling station. Have to go &amp; come by ferry now. Expect to go to Pietermaritzburg tomorrow. Have two parties. 
 Friday 29 August 1919 No Maritzburg for me today 'cos the Court of Enquiry is on. We didn't finish this morning but have one more witness to examine. After the court Osborne &amp; I were put on guard so that we could go to Martizburg tomorrow. Finished my letter to Nettie. Went on Guard at 5 pm &amp; came off at 1 am. [indecipherable] starting [indecipherable] during this guard. Rained fairly steadily during the night. Had a big thunder storm at 1 am.
