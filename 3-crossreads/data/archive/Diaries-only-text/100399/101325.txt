October 1916
2nd I have now been away one year six months of which has been in France. We are running a D.R.S. near Poperinghe Belgium after coming out of our part of the Somme offensive.
Oct 9th The weather here is very changeable every day it is windy with an overcast sky. However the days are not cold we have had very little wet weather. The trees are gradually losing their leaves some changing colour to Autumn tints. All crops have been gathered wheat stooked hops bagged the flax stripped. In fact the country is looking much the same as when I saw it first. To day I visited the local ?drome had a good look at the ?planes.
