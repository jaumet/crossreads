<p>22 July 1918<br/>Monday<br/>Left Avonmouth <strike>about</strike> early in the afternoon &amp; ran to Barrydock where we waited for a few hours picked up two Q boats &amp; the Marmora as Escort &amp; left about 6.30 The weather is not at all pleasant &amp; the sea fairly rough. The Marmora is an Orient Boat fitted as an auxillary Cruiser &amp; appears to carry about 8 guns. Barrydock is a very important coaling station on the Welsh side of Bristol Channel &amp; appears to be very busy just at present.</p>
<p>1918 July 23<br/>Tuesday<br/>Weather rather wet with heavy rain squals. Am under Captains orders on Bridge keeping look-out for Submarines. About 2.45 P.M. Marmora which was lying close in on our Port Bows &ndash; was torpedoed &amp; sank in 65 min: Two Q boats that were escorting gave chase to the Submarine &amp; dropped a lot of Depth charges but I think with one effect except to frighten Fritz away from us. Reported all hands saved but some must have killed by the explosion as it was very heavy. I was on watch at the time &amp; saw it happen one of our Escort have left us with the crew &amp; of the Marmora &amp; one is still with us.</p>
