with her.  Please thank her very much for the fags she so kindly sent.
Shan't repeat my own little experiences during the last six months 'cos I know Mother usually lets you have the news, but Gee! we've been knocking out a topping time of it - its really a delightfully pleasant war over here in England, they've given us a fair opportunity of dashing around the country & our conditions of living have certainly been luxurious.  Then the flying game itself is ever so interesting, only wish I'd taken it up earlier.  All this, together with splendid health, has converted our "strenuous period of training" in Blighty into an absolute picnic, which we have every reason to believe will continue - with variations - on our return to the haunts of the elusive & wily Hun-bird.
Please give my love to Auntie Bella, Alice, Ethel, Ede, young Eddie & your dear self.
Yours affectionatelyChas H. Copp.
Say! What about a joy ride when we get back to Melbourne, Bella?
