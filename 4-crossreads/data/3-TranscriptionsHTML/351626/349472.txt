<p>Tel &ndash; El &ndash;Kebir 10.7.1916. 6th A.L.H Details<br/>Dear Margaret,<br/>I believe the mail closes sometime this week so am writing a few lines.  I have not much time just at present, but anyhow there is no news except that although we will most likely move from here, it does not seem likely that we will ever leave Egypt.  I owe Connie a good many letters but am not sure of her address so will send them via Croydon.  Hope you enjoyed your holidays   &amp; that you like your new position.  Kind regards to M Heard.<br/>Love to all from your affectionate brother<br/>Charlie</p>
