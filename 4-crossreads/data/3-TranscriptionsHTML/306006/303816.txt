<p>12-4-17<br/>arrived at out destination at 3 oclock &amp; took over from a yeomanry Brigade &amp; the Regts split up, a squadron at each post about a mile apart &amp; are digging trenches. I ran a phone line to A Sqdn as soon as I arrived &amp; had a lively time doing it as Roger is very lively. I then ran one to C Sqdn &amp; we were linked up everywhere in a very short time. A good many mud buildings are scattered about here these are now deserted, &amp; are the home of "cockies" the country is undulating &amp; practically the whole of it is under cultivation &amp; our horses are having an exceptionally good time in consequence, a good many motor cars (armoured &amp; otherwise) are flying about this part of the world; We met some tommies bringing in a captured Turk.</p>
