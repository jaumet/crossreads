<p>occurence here.  Nights seem very long; dark at 5.30 pm &amp; no light whatever allowed.</p>
<p>25/12/15  Saturday,  Christmas Day<br/>What a contrast to previous years; never expected to spend Xmas in the desert.  Beautiful morning after shower last night, although rather cold early.  Surprise for dinner; Christmas pudding &amp; preserved fruits, very acceptable after food we have been receiving lately.  Received bad news during day, re Allies evacuating Dardanelles.  Worked most of the day making dug out, to act as dressing station in preparation for an attack.  Turned in 10.30 pm feeling very tired.</p>
