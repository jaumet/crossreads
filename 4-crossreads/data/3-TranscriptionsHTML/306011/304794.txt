<p>wearing red fezs were working on the roads which were crowded with horsed waggons, lorries, motor ambulances, etc, all painted a dirty, dull grey colour. French transport has a very nondescript appearance; the horse waggons are old hay carts, furniture cans etc. of different types &amp; the mechanical vehicles all seem to be second hand &amp; done up on requisitions. However they get the work done which is the main thing. We had 4 hours in Dunkirk &amp; had a good look round. First went out to Malo-les-Bains in the tram, a well known seaside resort before the war. In the other direction we went to St Pol by tram. Both in the town &amp; out at Malo were evidences of German handiwork. Dunkirk has been both bombed &amp; shelled (from land &amp; sea). Rusty barbwire entanglements run along the beach with trenches behind them. Inside the harbour entrance there is a fine system of waterways &amp; canals full of naval &amp; fishing shipping. We dined in an up to date restaurant &ndash; a real good French dinner. The town is fairly quiet &amp; prosperous looking. There were numerous American sailors, Belgian officers &amp; English military &amp; naval men</p>
