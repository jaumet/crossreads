Only a short note this time & I want you to let the remainder of family know that I am O.K. We have been fighting again I cannot give you particulars of the scrap till we pull out of this area sufficient to say the old 2nd covered itself in glory taking 3000 yds & a big village off Fritz. I took a company over & we had the toughest proposition but won through losing "I cannot give figures" some men 1 officer killed he was my sergeant in Pozieres & my best officer this time, poor fellow was hit in the head leading his men. Lots of prisoners my company sent back nearly a hundred unwounded ones, besides wounded & lots killed. Received pat on back for work done am enclosing message commanding officer sent me please keep as a souvenir. Quite a novel experience for me not to get wounded, it is much better to pull through unhit I think, lots of betting about me being the first officer to come back wounded, the old Doc was quite disappointed about "as he puts it" me failing him. Lots of love to self B & R. from your loving brother KenCK Millar
