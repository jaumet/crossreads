<p>29 December 1918<br/>This morning at 7 am we entered in France &ndash; the land that for over 4 years has been the scence of turmoil &amp; carnage, of stress &amp; patriotism. All seems peaceful here &amp; save for the uniforms &amp; while the activity is such as one would meet in any large seaport town.</p>
<p>We go ashore like a gang of school girls frightened to lose each other. My importance has increased as I alone can speak French. I have Badeker with me &amp; the names of the streets &amp; restaurants &amp; know where I am going.</p>
<p>We pass a YMCA hostel &amp; all decide to enter. This was originally the Hotel D'Angleterre but has been taken over by the YMCA as an officers rest house. It is thronged with Americans who seem to be in every little hamlet of this country. After this meal we report &amp; are told to be in camp by 11 am As this is impossible I do not attempt to reach there but spend some hours in Havre with Davies</p>
<p>The whole life of the town</p>
