<p>Letterhead as before.<br/>3.  which we have a Photo.  We walked up to Harris Thrace then &amp; saw the old place.  It is very shabby now &amp; Marie says that they have almost let the place go to ruin.  I saw the Institute at the back which was the residence of Mrs Hickmot too.  We then went down &amp; sat on the Prom. for a while &amp; after some more Tea at 7.30 pm we caught the Train to Sulby where Auntie met us with the Pony &amp; Sulky.  We arrived Home 20 minutes later.  Grandma was away nursing Hannah's Husband so I did not see Her nor did I see any of the Others.  But Marie &amp; Auntie Annie are the Ones I want to see Most.  We all went to bed about 11 pm but I could not sleep in the Feather Bed.  I heard the clock strike every Hour but 2. a.m.  I woke them all up at 7 a.m. next morning &amp; enjoyed my meal immensely, everything so nice &amp; danety &amp; clean.  I amused myself in the morning at the Piano while Marie &amp; Auntie did the work.  After dinner the Pony refused to work in the reaping machine with the other mares so Auntie &amp; Marie &amp; I drove over to Uncles Farm at Ballabane, 6 miles distant &amp; a very pretty drive too. From the Farm I could see the Mull of Galway in Scotland &amp; the Mountains of Maughan in Ireland.  I do not know the distance but the nearest point of Ireland is 34 miles &amp; the Mountains are not very near the coast.</p>
