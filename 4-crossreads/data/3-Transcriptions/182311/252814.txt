<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to our occupation Fritz had, unusually, been rather quiet but seeming to know that he had &quot;green&quot; troops to deal with he became very active and pushed his snipers up to our lines, killing a lad in a listening post, this made our lads a little nervy but our little Lewis Guns eventually beat down their fire and sent some of them to their long long home, we saw them being carried into their lines in the morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning early, Captain Lansell staggered into the Company office with a blow over the eye, evidently from a spent bullet, he was sent to the dressing station then away, now we hear that he&#39;s in London for the next three months with a fractured skull base; now Captain Trebilcock is on his own for Mr.Collins was left in England, so was Mr.Lipshut and Mr.Thomas is doing the work of Scout Officer while I am detailed for a special job and am away from the Company for about three weeks training for a very big and important job.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fairweather and Bogle were on the job with me, F. got mumps then they sent Lieut.Moore in his place, he got mumps next day, tonight Bogle and I <s>went</s> <sup>await</sup> another officer and wonder whether he too will develop mumps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, we are out of the trenches again and very comfortable in Billets, training ourselves and the best of our men for three weeks, we will miss some of the worry of running a Company shorthanded, the men will miss fatigue dut and all are well cared for, so &#39;tis good.</p>
