 When the boys come home 
 We are proud of our boys, our brave boys who for their country are fighting Not for the sake of conquest or gain but for the wrongs that needed righting For the sake of the lands that lie ruined  For the sake of the homeless &amp; sad For the sake of the loved ones in homeland They have given up all they had  We think of them there in the trenches In the cold the mud &amp; the rain With the fiery shells bursting round them While they fight with might &amp; main But what keeps our brave boys so steadfast with courage that never gives way? The Lord stands beside them to help them and he is their strength &amp;  their stay 
 But where did they learn of this Saviour save from the lips of their mother or from some comrade who loved him who spoke of Him one to another But some had forgotten this Saviour Till danger, death &amp; alarm (when the comrade fell dead beside him) made them fly to his sheltering arm 
 But what about you in the Homeland Is this Saviour precious to you Do you pray him to keep these dear lads &amp; commit them to him anew. are you keeping your promises to them are you helping with all your might To comfort cheer &amp; help them who have bravely gone to the fight 
 When this terrible war is ended &amp; the boys &ndash; the brave boys &ndash; come home come back to loved ones - &amp; mother ah! what will they find when they come a world where all is against them a struggle for life to begin or their loved ones &amp; dear mother  awaiting to welcome them in.
