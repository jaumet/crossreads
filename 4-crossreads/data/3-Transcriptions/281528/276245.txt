<p>25/3/18 &ndash; La Basse Ville<br/>O.P.'s command a splendid view and our observers tell us of many Huns seen, some with maps and glasses, on the sector to our left.  Returned to Bn. H.Q. and word came through from Bde. that the S.O.S. had come through on wireless.  Great excitement.  All our cooks, batmen and direlicts stood to arms and as no attack developed we concluded that our wireless had caught a message errant from down South.  The G. found two of my men drunk in a sap today owing to some officer's carelessness of supervision re issue of rum.</p>
