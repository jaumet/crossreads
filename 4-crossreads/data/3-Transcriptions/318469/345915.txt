<p>25th<br/>Left Queen about 1.30 am with Destroyer towing.  Landed 4.30 amid a perfect Hell of lead fired when we were about 100 yds away &amp; we charged through until we were only 10 yds away from Enemy.  Infantry charged magnificently &amp; drove the Turks back over 1 mile before midday.  Shrapnel on landing &amp; heavy firing continued all day but the operations were carried out splendidly.  The Turks position should have been almost impregnable. Our Infantry work was wonderful &amp; drove everything before it.  Our casualties for day said to be about 2 Bttlns.  Our Coy lost 4 killed and about 4 wounded.</p>
<p>26th<br/>Our Forces continue to have good success.  Losses not so heavy as expected.  The bombardments of the Enemy's position by our boats was enormous &amp; tremendous amount of firing being done &amp; keeping the Enemy's reinforcements back British troops coming up behind Enemy.</p>
<p>27th<br/>Hard fighting all day.  Our boys have pressed but holding their own navy do splendid work.  Queen Elizabeth reported to have blown up Fort at Shanuk.  Tonight No. 1 Sec.Engs trenching and barbed wire.</p>
