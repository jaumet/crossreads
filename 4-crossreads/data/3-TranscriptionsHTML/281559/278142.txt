<p>my pay book is in London but the Capt is going to lend me 200 francs &amp; that will give me enough with my private cash : went to cinema in afternoon :</p>
<p>Monday Aug 26th : Mardyk</p>
<p>Cleaned myself up in morning : caught the 5.30 pm to Calais, dodged the M.P.s. &amp; caught the ordinary Paris train instead of the slow leave train : weary ride :</p>
<p>Tuesday Aug 27th : Paris</p>
<p>Arrived at 8 am &amp; got fixed up at the Barracks : went to the Leave Club &amp; fixed up for a bed : it is in a large hotel which has been taken over &amp; is run by the English girls &amp; women of Paris : tucker &amp; beds are splendid : trip to Invalides : trophies of war in the yard interesting : fine building : beautiful pictures round the walls : tomb of Napoleon is glorious the light effect on the crucifix in front of it is lovely : architecture inside &amp; the dome painting very fine : went to the big wheel (300 feet high) &amp; went round : fine view of Paris : seen the big gun captured by the Ausies &amp; it is a beauty : complete train ammunition &amp; all : Paris people very enthusiastic over it : home &amp; tea : after tea to concert given by the leading members of the Opera Comique : sketches from Operas etc &amp; it was great : fine acting &amp; the voices wonderful : a French Lieut rendered the Marsellaise at the end in a fine style &amp; the show finished with the National Anthem : bed &amp; welcome too as I felt tired out :</p>
