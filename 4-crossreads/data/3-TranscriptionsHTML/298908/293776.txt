<p>All the Sgts. are up before Orderly Room again in the morning.  I'm hanged if they will go on parade, they have all worked their heads pretty successfully of late but I think its coming to an end they are absolute experts in dodging parades &amp; I don't blame them I should be with them myself only I am lucky &amp; have my little dental job this excuses me from all other duties so I am set, it's a most peculiar thing how once a Sgt. gets over in these English Camps he will do anything rather than go on parade, yet in his Battalion he does not mind it so much.</p>
<p>4th.  Had an early tea tonight so as we could catch the 5.15 train to London.  4 of us Clatworthy, Bull, a 7th Battn. Sgt. &amp; I had a car ordered so we left fairly late &amp; just got into Warminster in time to hop on the train, the train was packed with soldiers &amp; we ran into Paddington a few minutes after 8, then there was the devils own rush to get to the tubes &amp; away for the night.
