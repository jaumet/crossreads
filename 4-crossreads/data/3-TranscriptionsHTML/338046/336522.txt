<p>1917<br/>May<br/>was transferred to B Company, and joined a Regimental school for budding NCO's.   We had a fortnight of it and an exam at the end.   All our legs were a bit stiff owing to the extra quick marching that we had been indulging in.  I, with about 39 others, out of 40 passed the exam.<br/>One man got a stripe out of it.   The rest of us came a thud.<br/>About this time food began to get scarce in England.   In Wilton School of Arts there was a notice:-<br/>"Owing to the scarcity of food, will you kindly have only <u>one Tea</u> in Wilton today."   So we cut out our usual three feeds and confined ourselves to two.   Over in Broadchalke church one Sunday, I found a soldier playing the pipe organ.   Just as we arrived the old organ blower reniged, so as I had blown a pipe organ before, at Seven Hills church, I  volunteered to take his place, and we had some fine music.   Getting back to the food.</p>
