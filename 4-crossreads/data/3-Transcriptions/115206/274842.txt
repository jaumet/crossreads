<p>September 1918.<br/>Sunday 29</p>
<p>Advanced to position in rear of Hargicourt. Weather very soggy. Reveille at 1 am. Left for position in rear of Bellinglisk at 3am. Barrage opened at 5.15 am. Yanks took their first objective by 11 oclock. They were slightly disorganised by fog and m.g. fire.<br/>We landed into a very rough possie, and have so far been fortunate enough to only have two casualties. Mr Kerr and driver Hutchinson &ndash; both Blightys.<br/>Laid a line through a m.g. barrage and 5.9, 4.2, ditto but find I could not maintain same owing to the dirty wether. Slept in a shell hole for the night.</p>
