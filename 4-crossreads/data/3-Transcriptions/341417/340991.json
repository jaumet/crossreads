<p>No 1 Aust Gen Hosp<br/>Warminster<br/>England. 18.8.19</p>
<p>Dear Miss King</p>
<p>Just a short note letting you know that I am leaving England for home on Sunday the 24th of this month (August) in the Hospital [ship] Kanowna.</p>
<p>While I have been in camp in England waiting for a Boat I took ill and it turned out to me Malaria fever, so they are sending me home on a hospital ship.</p>
<p>I hope you did not think I had forgotten you for I was so uncertain of my departure for home that I did not know whether to write or not. However I will soon be amongst you all and I think it time dont you?</p>
