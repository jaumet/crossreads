<p>disease for a Gyppo village has a odour distinctly its own.<br/>At the stations the Gippos make plenty of noise with their Eggs are cooked etc. We passed through Tel el Kebir the graveyard where some of the fallen if previous wars lay at rest. It looked very pretty with its abundance of flowers &amp; Greenery &amp; appeared to me to be well looked after. Tag a Tig was a junction and appeared a Town of Fair size. We arrived at Cairo at 1.20 pm &amp; were bundled into two Trams &amp; taken to Abbasia some two miles from Cairo. Here we camped near 14 AG.H &amp; 31st General Hospital. We placed in large huts near a refreshment room which sold everything a soldier needs</p>
