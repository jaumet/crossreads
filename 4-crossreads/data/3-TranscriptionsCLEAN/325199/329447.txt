Saturday morning June 3/16A wet march into Seymour to catch 6.15 train to city. Said Good Bye to Lizzie and steamed out of Seymour. Arrived at Flinders St safely & hence on to Port Melbourne Pier about 9. Had lunch & roll call and went on board about 11. Sailed out from the pier about 1 p.m. amid the cheers of a large crowd. Had dinner about 1.30. Wrote 2 letters as we steamed down the bay and posted them with the pilot when he left us outside the Heads at 5 o'clock.
Sunday, June 4. 1916Sick all day, a very rough sea. Passed Cape Bridgewater early in the morning about 7.
Monday June 5. 1916Sick again today but not quite so bad as yesterday. Sea still very rough.
Tuesday June 6. 1916A little better today, had some breakfast & dinner. The medicine I got last evening & this morning from the doctor done me a lot of good.
