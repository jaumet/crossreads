  
 Just as I arrived at St Pancras a train load of British prisoners arrived from Germany & they received a great reception. Some Sheffield gentlemen travelled with me from Leeds to Sheffield & they were explaining all about the Sheffield works to me. For miles it is all munition factories in that district. In Sheffield saw where Zeppelins had dropped bombs. Midland railway carriages are very comfortable - I think about the best over here.  Nice fine day. When going down to station at Barrow, saw the cruiser Amethyst in dock for repairs.

Went with him to Poplar where he works, going along the Strand, Fleet St, Cornhill, & Commercial Rd, passing en route Petticoat Lane. While he was doing some work I went along High St & Preston Rd Poplar to near the East India Docks to Millwall Station & had look around. Also saw the Blackwall tunnel. After having cup of tea & sandwich each, left works at 2 pm & went along East India Dock Rd to near Mile End Rd & got a tram to Aldgate. There took Tube & went via Charing Cross, Victoria, Sloan Sq, Earls Court to Richmond. Went & saw Thames River & then up Richmond Hill to Star & Garter from which there is a fine view.
