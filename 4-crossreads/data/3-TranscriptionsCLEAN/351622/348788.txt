28 February 1916 MonStart of tent week this week. I have with me Pat Murphy as partner. Venereal diseases very prevelant. Good information from Head Quarter that we will be off to France in a couple of weeks hence. News came through to-day concerning the big battle of Verdun. Good news & all rejoicing.
29 February 1916 TuesThis place is becoming quite a home. The only drawback is the insufficient supply of water. One cannot wash even a pair of socks let alone his body. Tucker here is very good. Football every afternoon after tea. A spy was caught in Egyptian clothes to-day out here & taken to H.Q.
