Great trouble in getting the lads out, they were dogtired after last night and their clothes all sopping still. Moved off by sections to Erquinham and went through the old fashioned little town to a brick building once a laundry and a dye factory now Divisional baths. Thomas late of S/6, now an AMC Corporal was in charge. The men marched in and took off all their clothes, lousy garments were disinfected while they were bathing and on coming out all were issued with clean underclothes &amp; socks. Passing inside there are big wooden vats full of hot steaming water. The men all got right in up to their necks and soaked and washed for about half an hour. Great joy and splashing ? about 500 there altogether. Special place for officers ? had the best bath since last at Shepheards Hotel Cairo.

A few shells landed not far off and blew out some machine gunners, one getting his cheek blown about. The Brigadier round and annoyed at one of my men (who was not aware of his passing) using the utterly depraved term \"f---ing\" in referring to an aeroplane, and also handed out a jolt with reference to a fellow who went out into full view of the enemy \"just to watch it better\". </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Returned to my billet at noon and got word our artillery were going to strafe \"Fritz at 3 pm.

Relieve us on Thursday and we don't go into the trenches again before going into reserve. Our artillery did a mild strafe in the afternoon and after tea we had a daring exhibition of flying by British Aeroplanes. Hundreds of shells bursting round them but very daring flights continued.
