He told me to come to his barrack the next morning for breakfast.  I turned in without undressing, and as bad as the bed was I slept through, but the next morning didn't we all feel rotten.  Every man in the barrack had a terrible cold (which I for one never lost the whole time I was in Germany).  Then the Huns marched us to the bath house, clipped our hair as close as possible.  The rest of the hair on our body was burnt off by a chemical like blue grey paint.  We then had a hot bath.  Meanwhile our clothes were being fumigated, then we were marched back to barracks.

He was with four other English, all very nice chaps, and I can tell you I had a jolly good time while I was in the camp.  I had all my meals with them.

They made us change in the open in view of everybody, and by jove it was cold. 
 On the 20th March we were formed into transports of twenties to go out and work.  Of course Bill Brookes (my mate) and I got together as usual, and at 4 a.m. on the 21st March we marched off.  It was raining and it was as cold as ice, and pitch dark.  We arrived at the station,
