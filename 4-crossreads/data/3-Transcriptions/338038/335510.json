<p>Dear Mr Garling<br/>Yours of 6th .8.18 to hand.  I am very pleased to state that under my treatment I have improved wonderfully.  So much so that I am looking for an entry into civil life again.<br/>First I must explain I am still in the forces &amp; under treatment yet I am like the Scot looking for a new job before I lose the old.<br/>I will give you an account as near as possible the battles my late O.C. commanded the battery in.<br/>He joined the battery in a position behind "Flers" relieving Capt Shepherd.  We then moved to a place in front of "High Wood" &amp; whilst there the battery along with others was mentioned by General Monash ?  for supporting the 13th Btn in an attack on "stormy trench".</p>
