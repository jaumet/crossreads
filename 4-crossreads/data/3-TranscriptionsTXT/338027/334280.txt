Thursday, 3rd December, 1914A German tramp named Triffles which was captured by the British passed us in the morning.  She had ammunition on board.  An aeroplane passed o'head about 9-30 am & another before lunch.  We entered the canal about 2 pm in the wake of the Miltidaes.  We were cheered all along the beautiful entrance by French, British & Egyptians all detail of the trip up the canal I have written in my note book.  The canal was patrolled right along the banks with Indian troops, encamped & with batteries.  Canal beautiful scenery expect to reach P Said in morning.
Friday, 4th December, 1914Arrived at Port Said at 5 am anchored alongside dock with 3 French Hydroplanes & Port Said crammed full of boats.  Three firemen gave trouble & marines from the H.M.S. Swiftsure came aboard, they took the men off and charged them with insubord, refusing work & thieving from troops.  They informed us that they were going down the canal to bombard the Turks, who are reported to be not 50 miles away.  All the eastern district of Port Said is flooded by dykes thereby protecting the city.  Took French leave over side of boat at night & went ashore with a party had royal time.
