Tuesday 22.1.18 to Monday 28.1.18
Foot extremely sore for the first few day, could not sleep at night owing to pain. After a couple of dressings improved now is fairly good only I cannot walk very well. Have not yet been ordered up by the Doctor but get up each day for the last couple of day; get very tired of bed. Food conditions here very poor no amusements of any description, will not be sorry to get out.
Tuesday 29.1.18 to Saturday 9.1.18 
Still in hospital but am going to be asked to be marked out in a day or so.
Time drags awfully, nothing whatever to do to pass the time. Have walked out
