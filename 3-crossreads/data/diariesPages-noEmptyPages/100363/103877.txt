Wet and stormy all day. Remained at camping packing up instruments and siding up things generally. 
Had dinner with Azzi Webb, Wilkins and the Officers of the 7th Field Engrs. Retrospecting on my work done in the Salient, I conscientiously feel it has been successful and is complete in all -details. 
With Wilkins record work practically every branch has been dealt with. We have both applied ourselves diligently to the work and now sense the reward of our endeavours. Wilkins is an excellent fellow, enthusiastic, conscientious and diligent. The innumerable hairs breadth escapes, and our marvellous good luck I only hope may continue. And we return thanks for it.
