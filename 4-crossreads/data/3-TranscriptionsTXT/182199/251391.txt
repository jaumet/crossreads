My dear Mother
I am writing this - my first real letter to you since landing - midst&nbsp;the peaceful calm of a Sunday morning. Today it is exactly three weeks since we landed and though in one way we seem to have been here for ages, in another way the time seems to have slipped by very quickly. I am writing this letter in the trenches. I have a nice little dug-out in which I have rigged up a desk and chair by means of two biscuit tins and an ammunition box. This leaves just room for me to squeeze in but I am now firmly established and unless something unexpected happens from our friends across the other side I am free for the next two or three hours. Things are beautifully quiet. The artillery have left off for lunch and even the snipers seem to have succumbed to the warm sun and gone to sleep so everything is propitious for letter writing. I will go right back to the time when we were still on our German prize the Derfflinger.
