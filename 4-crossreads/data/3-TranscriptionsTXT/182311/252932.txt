 Headquarters, 3rd.Australian Division. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Lieut Peters, M.C., is returning to his Battalion today, and I should like to express my great thanks to his Battalion and Brigade Commander and to your for having spared his services to us for so long.&nbsp; He has worked extremely hard and with great keenness, and all our Raiding parties have benefited from his instruction. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; It has been of the very greatest help to us to have had an experienced man who has been able to give us first-hand knowledge on the subject of Raids, and no better xxx selection could have been made so far as we were concerned that that of Lieut.Peters.
