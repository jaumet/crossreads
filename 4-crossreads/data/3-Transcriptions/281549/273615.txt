<p>markes which serve to show to the person passing that at one time a nice peaceful village was situated there.<br/>The beautiful wood at Fricourt is in an awful state almost every twig bears either a bullet or shrapnel mark, A lage part of the finest trees have been wantonly cut down &amp; destroyed by the Hun.</p>
<p>The following day the 19th I went with a fatigue party to Mametz wood, to cut wood for use in camp. Close to where I was working there was 6 dead Germans, the bodies were in a half decayed condition &amp; all their heads were missing. They have probably been lying there for six months unburied.</p>
<p>At lunch time we took some water from a shell hole &amp; boiled it to make tea. After we had finished our lunch &amp; drank all the tea, we discovered that the portion of a germans body from the knees to the chest was floating in the water that we had used, Of course the thoughts of it upset our stomachs &amp; bit some of the men were sick afterwards.</p>
<p>Until the 22nd of the month nothing much occurred except the usual routine of the camp.</p>
