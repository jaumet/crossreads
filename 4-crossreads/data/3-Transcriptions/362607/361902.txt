<p>Dear Dad, Mother &amp; George, I am Orderly Corp to-day &amp; as I have 2 P.C.'s left I thought I would send them Home. We had nice light Soda Biscuits, butter &amp; cheese, figs, grapes &amp; dates with Lime Juice to drink besides Bread &amp; Jam for dinner. What Ho that for a feed. We often get a feed of figs &amp; they are really lovely. The dates which I have eaten for the first time are luscious, &amp; not nearly so sickly sweet as when we get them packed in boxes. We had &pound; 2 saved out of Rations in some way &amp; the 2, Masters Assistant bought the above with the Money. We are living such a lazy life &amp; there does not seem to be any chance of moving.  Love Harry.</p>
