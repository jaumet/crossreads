 12.3.16 Sunday Sea Sickness seems to be leaving me now.  I have already had two good meals. Mess orderly today.  A man fell down the hatch this morning & broke his collar bone.  We have had splendid weather so far.  No chance of getting exercise here we are packed like sardines. 
 13.3.16  Monday Among the Coo ees there is a chap with a voice like Will Oaklands, he is a lovely singer.  The man who fell down the hatch is pretty bad suffering from internal injuries he never wasted  any time
