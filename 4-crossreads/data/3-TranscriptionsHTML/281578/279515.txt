<p>I wrote long letters to Mother &amp; Elsie.  Saty. 25 May Had saluting by numbers &amp; rifle exercises today. At 3 pm. we marched down to the next village, Cardonette, &amp; had a hot shower, &amp; were given a clean shirt &amp; underpants each, it was very nice to feel quite clean &amp; 'new' again. At night a cove from the 16th Bn. &amp; I found an estaminet where they had eggs, &amp; we had a good feed, 5 fried eggs &amp; 3 glasses of coffee each. It was the only one in the town, most of the people have gone, &amp; they were making a fortune. The place was full of soldiers &amp; an old chap fried the eggs on a small stove in a little pan, so it was a case of wait your turn. The chap I was with, is billeted down at Cardonette, &amp; he got a dozen eggs &amp; carted them in his hat. On the stool near us sat a V.C. hero, a country-looking old chap from W.A., named O'Mara. Came back, had a yarn to Boo, &amp; went to "bed". Sunday 26 May  Reveille at 6.30. pretty tough for Sunday, but it was a big morning. We fell in at 8.30, &amp; the whole of the 4th Brigade marched out a couple of miles along the road; before church parade started, the old Brig. (Brig.-Gen Brand) pointed out a ridge &amp; wood to us, &amp; explained a night stunt we are to carry out tomorrow</p>
