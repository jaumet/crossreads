  
 somewhere in France.  I must leave off soon & write to his sister.  He or I had an agreement once, that if anything happened either of us the other would write home.  I wish I could see him but alas - I cannot yet I feel him near and Harry too, has saved his brother at the cost of all that made life worth living.  Poor Harry I feel sorry  from  for him.  He has an old mother to keep & someone else is waiting for Harry, far away over the water.
