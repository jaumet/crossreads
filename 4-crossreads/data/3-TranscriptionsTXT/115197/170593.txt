The fascination of the Ocean.  Read & conclude book of "Prayer".
A very enjoyable & interesting motor excursion. Starting from Mentone we pass along the Sway Road through Lymington & Lyndhurst.  At Lyndhurst (20 miles from Bournemouth) we enter the local church famous for the fresco behind the Altar painted by Lord Leighton.
A beautiful modern Church.  An organ recital.
