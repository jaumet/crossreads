<p>where we are camping.  Great aerial activity immediately after fog lifted.</p>
<p>Thursday 23.11.16<br/>Fatigues at A.D.S.   Again foggy.  Fritz shelled heavily within a few hundred yards of us &amp; caught an A.S.C. depot.</p>
<p>Friday 24.11.16<br/>Cold &amp; windy.  Left camp about 1 pm to take up posts on line. Working out from Delville wood &amp; Le Beoufs.  Quite a route march to farthest post which I was unfortunate enough to strike.  Fritz shelled us on the way out &amp; again shelled heavily at about 8 pm.  Very long distance to carry, but going much better than on the other front we worked a few weeks back.</p>
