 19/3/16 Sunday 
 Had the most wretched night I've had for a good while - often got slightly wet & had rig tents - tighten pegs of an night at Enoggera - but last night was exceptional for Cairo - It had been blowing dust & Sand all day  yesterday  last night about 1-30 am the rain came down - had about half an inch, it came thro our grass hut - my blankets kept it out for a while, then I tried my Coat but had to get up & walk about, when I found I was laying in water - never said anything but booked it up against the Kaiser. 
 I went down to Mass at the Zeitouin Convent.
