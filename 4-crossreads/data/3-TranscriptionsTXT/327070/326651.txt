Saturday 4 March 1916
A rather cloudy day not so summery as last 2 days. Helping with company work during the morning, &amp; after lunch went in to Pension Wales to find Oll up &amp; ever so much better. Went out for a stroll together &amp; got a few more street snaps afterwards having afternoon tea at Groppi's.
Home for 6 o'c mess &amp; afterwards developed 4 rolls of films that I had on hand.
Sunday 5 March 1916
A beautiful day. No parade before breakfast.
At 9.15 church parade for "Other Denominations" conducted by Rev Finigan who spoke on "Christian Soldiers". There was quite a fair-sized parade making one wonder whether some of the men did not to this, the 1st parade so as to get away the earlier into Cairo: attendance at one of the parades is compulsory for all.
At 10 o'c the C. of E. parade was held &amp; I went to this as well &amp; was very glad afterwards for it was a splendid service. Capt Maxxed spoke about the significance of Lent &amp; was fine, carrying the men with him all the time. There was a good spiritual tone about his talk &amp; he seemed much more manly than the previous speaker, &amp; more powerful.
Over &amp; over I have longed to be in the unit Rid is attached to, &amp; feel sure that he will do great work with the Artillery.
After midday dinner went straight to Pension Wales &amp; found Oll practically herself. Together we went out for a stroll thro' some of the Cairo streets, Oll taking me to see where the Museum is situated, &amp; then had afternoon tea.
Returned to camp for 6 o'c mess &amp; spent evening at letters.
