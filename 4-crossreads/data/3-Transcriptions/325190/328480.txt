<p>wrong.  Religion, the mainspring, is not only unknown in most places, but a hypothetical substitute is set up in its place, which makes the position more hopeless because of misleading.  So little is sincere nowadays.<br/>On the other hand I myself have tried to practice the Christian religion &amp; have failed lamentably, so most of my puny efforts to right wrong have been neutralised.  It seems to me that only two ways confront the sincere man, open religion or open wickedness.  This hypothetical compromise is so useless &amp; misleading</p>
