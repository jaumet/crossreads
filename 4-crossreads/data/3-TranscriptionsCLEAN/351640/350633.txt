 My dear Girls:/ 
 8.45 a.m.  St Patrick 's Day has come and gone once again, quietly here into the limbo of obscurity, being counted amongst the three things that never return - time.  You know of course the other two as enumerated in the Khoran by Mahomet for the faithful to remember:  "There are three things that never return: the fleeting moment, the spoken word, and the lost opportunity".  In regard to the latter there is a very terse, very true, frequently applicable her, quotation on the Ruskin calendar of this morning:- "Much education sums itself in making men economise their words, and understand them." If you had only to listen to the continuous silly chatter, irresponsible egoism, want of understanding, of the little, rotund, vain, uneducated, mendacious, arrogant, commedian who sits opposite me a table, you could the more fully appreciate, the truth of Ruskin's sentence, which is taken from his Munera Pulveris. 
 It is noted in history that the conversion of the Irish by St. Patrick, was in the 5th Century, c 450 A.D.  During the same century the English began to settle in Britain, and the Kingdoms of Kent, Sussex, Wessex, and Northumbria were formed. 
 In the 6th Century, circa 597 A.D., Ethelbert, King of Kent, was converted by St. Augustine. 
 In this morning's paper I noted, that the Orama sails, outward from Suez, on the 25th inst.  I shall post what has been put together on this & following pages on the 22nd or 23rd inst., with hope that they may be sent to Suez and thence onward.
