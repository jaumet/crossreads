<p>November, 1915<br/>Tuesday 30<br/>Letters are going to be few and far between now &ndash; Too cold &amp; wet to write all is covered with snow but we will see it out. I am wearing Flannel shirt, Cardigan Jacket, Sheepskin Jacket Overcoat Macintosh Bear Skin cap &amp; 2 pairs of soks in my brother Officers boots &ndash; We all wear the same boots if possible as they are warm for the new man when he goes on duty.  The "old man plain" on a winters night is nothing to this Peninsular. Odd Turks gave themselves up poor half frozen clad beggars.</p>
