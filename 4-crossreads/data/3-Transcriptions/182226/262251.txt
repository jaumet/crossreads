<p>Tuesday 17 August, 1915</p>
<p>Yesterday &amp; today have been days of missery spent amongst the most apalling state of filth &amp; grime conceivable.</p>
<p>It turns out that the transport originally intended for us broke down &amp; we were sent off on this boat. On her last voyage she carried a cargo of coal, everything you touch is black.</p>
<p>Our rations have for the most part been dry biscuits &amp; bully beef with water. Anything would be an improvement on this.</p>
