 Alexandria Arrived 7.30 p.m. Spent the morning with Nowell at the ZOO  and posted you my notes and some snap-shots.  I hear the Mediteranean is alive with PORPOISES of the TIN FISH variety but am sure my luck will take me over alright. 
 [The remainder of the page crossed through.] I'm a bit scared at the idea of Dolly travelling & would take a job at home if I got the offer. 
 Anyway I'm having a good holiday now & my only worry is the waste of good L.S.D. Regina Hotel is my new place of abode. It is quite cool here.
