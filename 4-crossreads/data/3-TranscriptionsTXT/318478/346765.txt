Dear Mick
I've 'done me job' here and tomorrow I push out with four other ranks &amp; Colonel Bruxner, whom portrayed in pencil last year, for Kantara, which is near Ismailia &amp; Cairo that is home, &amp; the base.  Amman &amp; Salt must be left to some future date as I find that I am not the only weary man in the outfit.
I have a job to do at Kantara of the Field Ambulance work, very interesting and this and a week or so of camp life may do me good &amp; leave me fit for the only two places still unrecorded by the Official Artist, after which Home! with four aitches.
Yours AgainG.W. Lambert
