<p>We are near Albany so will soon be in the Indian Ocean. Saw my first flying fish this morning. Albatross not so much in evidence. Picked for Sergeant of the Guard, commencing 6 p.m. Not feeling too good. Finished London's "Cruise of the Dazzler". Bed 10 p.m. (on deck). Went rounds midnight. All correct.</p>
<p>Thursday, 3rd:<br/>Rounded Cape Leeuin during the night. No land in sight this morning. On Guard until 6 p.m.; 2 Corporals. Feeling better. Had a pipe of Lucy Hinton tobacco, the first smoke since I have been on board and it made me feel tip top. Concert in evening given by the [indecipherable] of the 5th Inf. and others. Sang "Kings of the Road". Bed 8.30 p.m. Artillery Sergeants had a group photograph taken this afternoon.</p>
<p>Boat rolling considerably but little pitching. Southern Cross and Venus very beautiful. Basil and I spent an hour, before going to bed, on the port saloon deck. We did not say much. The sky was very wierd, great scrolls and masses of deep, mauve black with luminous hieroglyphics of yellow in one great line along the west.</p>
<p>Friday, 4th:<br/>Drill (Signalling) on the poop deck for 3rd of the 6th. Physical Jerks before breakfast. Feeling much better. Boat still rolling---but no pitching. Weather warming up. Slept on deck. Bed 8.30 p.m.</p>
<p>Saturday, 5th:<br/>Inoculation for Enteric in morning. Very</p>
