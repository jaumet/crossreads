<p>I keep all your letters &amp; occasionally put in an odd half hour looking up back numbers &ndash; I also keep Margaret's they are so characteristic of her.   I don't  think you need send those Kahki handkerchiefs I have plenty of nice white linen ones.   In my last letter I asked you to send a tobacco cutter   I would like this if you can manage it.  The Easter egg has not yet arrived.  Cucumbers &amp; apples sound very good I think you might risk a few bobs worth   we dont get "kukes" here &amp; the apples are uneatable &ndash; the oranges however are very good.   Some nice sweets also would be a bit of a change.   But don't send any thing of any value because of the risk of its going astray.   I had a letter from the old man by last Australian mail received a few days ago &ndash; not much news in it &ndash; they were still up at Medlow and were both in tip top health and that is good news.   Fancy you writing to the "Times" but what a good idea.    We had some cruel days here early this week;   wind &amp; dust &amp; heat; in the day time the flies &amp; at night the mosquitoes fairly eat you.   Gee I would like a fly veil one of those green ones the country louts wear at home in Australia.   I have latterly been sitting at mess with helmet on &amp; goggles but they don't prevent the brutes committing suicide in one's cup of tea.</p>
