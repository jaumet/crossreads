64 September 22ndI am able to promenade round the square 3 or 4 times each day now -
The 6 officers who escaped several days ago have all been captured & are now in cells in this camp - They were captured right on the border, as they were they were crawling through - it was only a matter of half an hour & they would have been free again. They say sentries are 4 deep there & the places is lousy with dogs so I think it is practically hopeless to get through now we all feel very sorry for them especially for Robinson & Baerline on account of their previous trouble -
no concert tonight -
I exercise myself on the parallel bars & other gymnastic appliances every day now - & am slowly improving. no parcels again today

Macintosh & Co brought back late last night feeling very fed up - They were only 500 yds from the Rhine & say they could swim it as it was not more than 75 yds wide. They have been confined to cells pending their trial - Their total absence was 9 days.
Osborne, Marshall confined to cells 2 days for misbehaviour & being absent from Roll Call - They were well inebreated when admitted to cells & as a result smashed windows & forced the Cell Door open - besides keeping the whole camp awake till 1 am
