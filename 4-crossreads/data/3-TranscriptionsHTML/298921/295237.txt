<p>September, 1915<br/>Thursday 23<br/>Heard an interesting story re the building of the road to Pyramids about 6 miles across desert sand was completed in 3 days &amp; 3 nights by 70,000 men by order of the Khedire who fell in love with the Empress Eugenie when she came to open the Suez Canal. He was responsible for many of the best buildings in Cairo, being a very extravagant ruler, the Opera House (rarely used) was built same time as above road, &amp; was completed in 3 months cheap labor &amp; plenty of stone from MOKATTAM Hills, some caves have been made by stone getters, in which a squadron could be hidden</p>
