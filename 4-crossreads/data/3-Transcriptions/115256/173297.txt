<p>Sunday 7 February 1915</p>
<p>I was a member of the Quarter Guard to-day &ndash; the first land guard that I have done since I joined the Force.  I may mention Guard is not a very strenuous job usually (although you have to keep your wits about you).  But to-day there was a lot of "presenting arms" to generals and other "heads", as a big ceremonial church parade was held.  The massed bands play the hymns, and it took two of the twenty-two-and-sixpence chaplains to conduct the service.  Generals Maxwell and Godley were present, and a march past was subsequently held.</p>
<p>To-night I put in a couple of the coldest two hours I have ever spent.  I was on sentry-go towards midnight, and the cold was really "something to write home about".  You can put your hand flat on the ground, and, it does not need a great deal of imagination to suppose that you are laying hands on a block of ice.  Being a Sydneyite, these cold nights, after fairly warm days, do not in the least appeal to me or my exaggerated idea of comfort.</p>
