<p>8/4/18 &ndash; Amiens-Albert Road<br/>closely crowded together and if a heavy strafe occurs there are going to be many killed and wounded.  Dug in a couple of strong posts about 200 y. behind the front outposts and garrisoned them.  Things were quiet enough on the front.  Coming back to Bn. H.Q. found some daily papers and read some war news therein.  It appeared strange to think that all the world's eyes are on this push at Amiens and here are we sitting down across the road to Amiens &amp; wondering what the war news is.  Plenty of dead about &ndash; collected a lot of belongings off them.  Our snipers killed a number of Huns yesterday.</p>
