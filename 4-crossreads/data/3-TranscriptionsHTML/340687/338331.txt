<p>January, 1917. Saturday 27<br/>Cold wind all day. No duty. Cleaned up in morning and chopped wood in afternoon. Considerable aerial activity. Very heavy bombardment in early morning and later heard Fritz attacked but was barraged off and suffered severely. We took 600 prisoners and counter attacked taking three trenches which we held. We are supposed to attack again to-night and heavy guns have been active all day. Ingram may join C.L.R.</p>
