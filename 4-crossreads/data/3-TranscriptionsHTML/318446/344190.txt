It was this way &ndash; underestimating the turks capacity for defence or strength, the brigade advanced in close order mounted, to try &amp; rush the position.  The turks never fired at the screen &ndash; who by the way advanced nearly on top of the Turkish trenches &ndash; but waited until the whole brigade, mounted &amp; in close order, mark you, advanced to within 300 yds. of them, &amp; then let go with three or four machine guns &amp; some hundreds of rifles.  The brigade of course broke &amp; scattered back to cover &amp; reached it without one single man or horse being hit!!<br/>Christmas tomorrow on bully beef!<br/>Two 'planes over this morning, dropped several bombs but did no damage.
