<p>taking things very easy today. There is not much to do and the heat is very trying.</p>
<p>The heat this afternoon was very intense, especially late in the evening, about 6.P.M.</p>
<p>I was on picquet (4) <strike>this morning</strike> today from 4.30 to 7. It is a</p>
<p>Friday May 17. 1918.1383.<br/>a beautiful morning. I had a very easy picquet this morning. The horses being in a stable they required no attention, &amp; the morning was an ideal one. It is going to be another hot day.</p>
<p>This morning at the aerodrome there was a march past by the whole battalion with the Transports before General Monish and after dinner another before Sir Douglas Haig and party. It made a lot of extra work for the Transports all the other Battalions of the Brigade were present. There was a lot of adverse criticism by the Transports, some wishing that [Indecipherable] Monish was present as they considered it was only a waste of time &amp; effort, in the hot sun, &amp; delayed other &amp; more useful work.</p>

<p>Saturday May 18. 1918. 1384.<br/>Another hot day but not so hot as yesterday, thunder &amp; threatening rain in the evening.</p>
<p>There was a brigade show this morning being a competition between the Battalion Transports. The 38 Transports got 1st for everything, including the best Transport &amp; the best cooker, the best Limber and pair etc. the 32nd running second in some classes. The show was held in the aerodrome which by the way is not now used as an aerodrome owing to it being so close to the new front. It was 1130 when we returned. There were seperate judges for Limbres, harness, mules &amp; men.</p>
