Dear Jack,Just a note as we are on the move for another camp & things are upside down. Got a letter from you last mail & judge that you have been having a rough time. Gee-whiz but you must have a few howling matches there occasionally.
Hope dear old Clare is OK also Allie K. Give Clare my love. Also tell her that I wrote to Mrs Dye & she has invited me up to Pt Said. As things are now of course I can't get away just for a while.
We are expecting to be brawling with Johnny Turk & hope to give him a load or two. Things are greatly stirred here just now. Any way, the Devil looks after his own so have no fear & expect a line of more length shortly from your lovingly
Bill.
