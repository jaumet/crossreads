As it was coming from Boulogne with Soldiers returning from Blighty, nobody knew where it was. Anyhow after waiting about it eventually arrived at 11 am, it was full of Soldiers from all parts going to all parts a regular mixture of Regiments. After we joined the rear portion the Front portion was taken off, we started at 11.20 for Steinwerck. The Weather now had set in wet, so I expected to get a wetting looking for Brother. An Australian Soldier in our compartment happened to know exactly where No 3 Divisional Motor Transport Workshops were stationed, so he directed me successfully. The First Station we stopped at was Strazede were the 58th Coy of Canadian Railway Men were operating they having a small Depot to handle after stopping there a few minutes we proceeded on to the next Station called Baileau where a lot of Australian troops were quartered, a lot of Australian Soldiers detrained there after a few minutes travelling we arrived at Steinwerck where I said Good Bye to my Companion I made my way to some Transport Wagons in the yard.
