Wed, Feb 19 (cont.)We had cold Lamb for Tea which was very nice. It's a wonder they can't put up meat in a more appetising manner than as stew, especially in this hot climate; but I suppose its hard to find out how to dish it up at all, as it would soon go bad.At about 6 p.m. we "up-anchored" & started on our second phase of this wonderful Journey Home. Findlay, the chap who was supposed to have fractured his arm went ashore at Port Zufic, to get his arm Xrayed, &luckily found that it was not fractured. Every day I say to myself, I'll commence a letter to B & E, but I'm hanged if I can settle down to do anything.Thurs. Feb. 20.The sea is as smooth as glass & the ship is sailing along quite merrily. Its mighty hot sleeping down in the cabins & one wakes up in the mornings feeling much the same as one does in Melbourne when the North wind is blowing. Two of the Light Horsemen who came aboard yesterday are patients in our Hospital. One a shell shock case & the other malaria. The shell shock chap is pretty bad & has to have someone with him night & day. I had the job all the morning & one of his mates sat with him during the afternoon.  [indecipherable] is looking after him at night. It's mighty hot. They put the canvass over the decks today which makes it nice & coolon deck. We had oranges for dessert today & they were very acceptable.
