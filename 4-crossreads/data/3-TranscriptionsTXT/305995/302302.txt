 During the past seventeen days, our Division has travelled about two hundred miles per horse, come in contact with the enemy on two occasions &amp; have captured over four thousand prisoners, besides a large quantity of guns; ammunition, etc. 
 When one considers that after a ride throughout the night without rest &amp; then sees action at daylight the following day, it only proves what a fine healthy body of troops they are &amp; the way they play with the enemy is an eye-opener, I assure you.  On the Magdhaba "stunt" on Dec. 23rd we covered twenty five miles in four hours &amp; a half, but the journey from El Arish to Raffa occupied fourteen hours &amp; still they seemed as fresh as daisies &amp; anxious to "mix it" with the Turks as soon as we arrived. Now to get back to the work of the ambulances &amp; cleaning stations. OVER [in margin]
