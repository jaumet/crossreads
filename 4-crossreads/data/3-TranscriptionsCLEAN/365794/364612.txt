  
 Monday 29 July 1917 [1918] Yesterday was anniversary of Kath's birthday 16 years ago & yet it is all so vivid it might have been yesterday. Went 27th 5 p.m., all pleased to see me.  Miss Gemmel on duty after 8 days at P. Said. How I love my own room again all to myself! even if the kitchen noises are deafening, gum leaves rustle out through the window & stray falling leaves drift onto my bed.
