Hut very much. I did not take much notice as I thought that a Big Gun had come up the Line had fired a shot, which they often do, but when the Engines came down at 4 Pm for relief, one Driver told me that a Terrible Explosion had occurred at the Zouave Salvage Dump had killed about 50 men injured about 100 that they had an exciting experience putting out fires with water from the Tender prevented any further explosions taking place. There were great excitement in Camp all the Evening discussion the Explosion. 
Thursday 10/1/18, I signed on at 8 am went up to St Jeau Yard did some work then I had an oppertunity of going over viewing the siding where the Explosion occurred, Zouave Siding is about 100 yds from the yard had first been used as an Ammunition Dump but latterly part of the siding is used as a Royal Engineers Park for storing material the other part as a Salvage Dump for all kinds of damaged shells bombs. There are two roads running paralel about 15 yds apart, between these roads was were the Explosion took place. On approaching the Siding I was horrified to see pieces of flesh clothing laying about everywhere lumps of Mud laying about, right between the two sets of Rails. There were two large Craters, one about 30 ft
