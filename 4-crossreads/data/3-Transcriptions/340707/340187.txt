<p>59<br/>much has occurred that it is almost impossible to remember what happened on the different days so much so that I cannot recall what I did on some dates.</p>
<p>This day I took Madelon to Sacre Coeur &ndash; Place [indecipherable] &ndash; Madame Nini &amp; Spanish Bar, &amp; then walked home in the early hours of the morning</p>
<p>11-7-19<br/>Impossible to say what happened</p>
<p>12-7-19<br/>Madelon has asked me to an afternoon tea that is given by herself &amp; friends Besides myself there are 3 other men all Grecian but either naturlised or students one of them has been in French Air Service &amp; carries a bracelet of thin gold chain which he says is distinguishing mark of Air Force. The refreshments are on luxurious scale for two students Conversation is ordinary.</p>
<p>Madelon I think intended this to be a celebration of her exam which ended this morning but unfortunately she failed on the last day.</p>
<p>12-7-19<br/>Slept nearly all day in order to get some sleep in hand as this is the commencement of the festivaties</p>
