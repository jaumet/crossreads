<p>scene of the desert on either side, was inspiring. At 11 oclock the cheering again burst forth as we were passing two "Aussie" Camps, 10th Lighthorse on the left &amp; the 4th Lighthorse on our right. I rose at 5 a.m. on the 12th and the scenery along the banks of the Canal, was magnificent. Picturesque bungalows, or Oriental houses, surrounded by huge palm trees, could be seen. Words cannot describe the different colouring of the desert, as the dawn was breaking. There is without a doubt, a certain fascination about Egypt, and it rightly named, when called the fascinating East. About 6 a.m. we anchored at Port Suez, &amp; more stores were put on board. The Karagola went by, &amp; we gave her a cheer. On again shortly after breakfast, and words fail me to describe the view that met the eye.

Aden was passed on the 4th day after leaving Suez, &amp; then the weather improved slightly, soon after passing through the Gulf of Aden.  It was a great relief to be more in the open &ndash; the Indian Ocean, away from the desert winds. Hells Gate near the Island of Perim, was passed about 5 a.m. on the 15th inst.   Barren looking places with a lighthouse dotted here &amp; there &ndash; the name is rather appropriate. It is rather interesting to mention here, that the "China" ran ashore at Hells Gate 1898, and it was many months, before she was refloated. About mid-night in the Light house at Aden could been seen.
