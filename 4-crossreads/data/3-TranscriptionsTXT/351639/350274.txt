 [Continuation of Compton Mackenzie's despatch of 30 June 1915] Sir Ian Hamilton at once gave the D.S.O. to Lt. Col. Wilson, an honour in which every man in his regiment may be said to share.  Of the Royal Scots one can add nothing but that they are Edinburgh Territorials brought in by the fortune of War to make the twelfth regiment of the immortal 28th Division whose deeds since the twenty-fifth of April may have stirred the ghost of Homer to sing their valour. 
 Mention has been made already of the difficulties that oppose our advance upon the two flanks.

Even the Haricot redoubt with its damnable entanglements and its maze of communicating trenches was in French hands.  On the right, however, the First Division after reaching their objective had been counter attacked so effectively that they had fallen back.  Again they advanced: again they were driven out.  It began to look as if
