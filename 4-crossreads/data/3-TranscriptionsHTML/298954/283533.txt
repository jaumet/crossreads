<p>Wed 5th Oct.<br/>At 5.30 am. "Wolf" pulled away from "Hitachi" and steamed out onto the trade route.</p>
<p>We all felt that we would have gladly exchanged the excitement for a peaceful transfer to the "Hitachi" as she lay behind us, placidly at anchor.</p>
<p>Dr Flood etc stood at the rails and waved "good-luck" to us as we pulled out.</p>
<p>'Plane rose at 2.30 pm</p>
<p>Thu.  4th Oct.<br/>"Wolf" is cruising up and down on the one route changing from N.E. to S.W. every few hours or so.</p>
<p>Sat.  6th Oct.<br/>At 2 am this morning the alarm bell rang.   All cleared for action on deck.   I managed to slip up to the poop door in the bustle &ndash; on deck the guns and tubes were manned, it was a clear moonlight night, and a warrant officer was focusing on a mark on the starboard beam.</p>
<p>We were hustled below and the torpedo doors fell.</p>
