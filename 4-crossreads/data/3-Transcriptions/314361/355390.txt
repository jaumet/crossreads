<p>Amiens is a fairly large city, &amp; has a beautiful Cathedral, When I saw it It is about 8 kilometers from Raineville, which made a rather long walk. Amiens is full of shops, crowded streets all narrow. This city is regularly bombed at night by aeroplanes, so the cathedral when I saw it was sand bagged, there is a wall of sand bags in front of the main entrance, &amp; a good many in the interior, protecting special parts. The interior is beautiful, high roofs with [stru?] columns reaching up to it, beautiful windows &amp; statues, it was all in good taste:<br/>Rest Camp Allonville<br/>18. 11. 16.<br/>Have been in this place about six day, the last little time I had in the Somme trenches, brought out a complaint of long standing, a sort of rash &amp; hitch, which they call scabie, though I have not got it in the worst form. Allonville is about four miles from Rainville. I am having a fairly easy time, sleep in untill breakfast, do a little fatigue work when I cannot dodge it. The treatment is hot</p>
