<p>Diary<br/>June 20th<br/>Some of the Regiment went for a bathe in the Mediterranean today, only four miles away but I have not been yet &ndash; It is heavy sand to ride over &amp; men &amp; horses want rest &amp; sleep chiefly &ndash;<br/>Off again at 3 AM or 1,500 as we call it on another 2 days stunt to Johnny Turk &ndash; The men in the line, always seem to know long before the officers get orders, what is going to happen &ndash; like in the Bush where the traveller can always tell you when each station will commence shearing &amp; number of sheep to be shorn<br/>21st<br/> Hot as Hell- Marched all night &amp; all day &ndash; Horses [indecipherable] up wont drink brackish water &ndash; heavy sand &ndash; Destroyed some wells &amp; burnt some huts, took a few Bedouin prisoners &ndash; very rough on both the men &amp; horses &ndash; We take our wireless plants with us on Camels when the little oil engines begin to work in the dark it sounds just like an aeroplane &amp; then men tumble out, if very tired a Zep  would not wake them<br/>22nd<br/>I am trying to write this &amp; get under the shelter [indecipherable] upon my sword &ndash; No trees All night another</p>
