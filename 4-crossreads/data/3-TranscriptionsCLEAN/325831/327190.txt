 2. As a matter of fact I have reason to think that the son will be engaged in training for some time, as he has shown peculiar aptitude for it, & as you know it is enormously important, & we have suffered rather seriously in the past for the want of efficient training of the troops who go into the field. You will be able to assure the Judge that if he is efficient at training, he is doing more valuable work (in any rank under a Major anyhow) than he could possibly do on the field of battle itself. 
 Kindly thoughts. 
 Truly yours
