  
 to Wednesday & Thursday. Although we are only a couple of kilos away from Marquaix, we dont get shells near us except at long intervals, & we are able to get a drink of tea at the Y.M.C.A., & also such a pleasant way of spending an evening as a concert. It is the first time I have ever known a concert party to show so near the line as an A.D.S.. They start at 8.15 & was to be finished before Fritz comes over. 
 I feel lazy & happy today.
