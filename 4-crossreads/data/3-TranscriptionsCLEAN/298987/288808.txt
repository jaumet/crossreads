 Monday 19th A little; very little drill this morning Swimming carnival in afternoon too cold for me. 
 Tuesday 20th Drill this morning at least  it w  we are supposed to drill. We do  a few moments untill the Officers get away & then sit down. If an Officer comes along when we are doing nothing the Sargent says he is giveing  us a lecture & the Officer smiles & passes on. Went to see a Company of Infantry practicing an attack covered by Tanks The tanks can go practically anywhere & it is wonderful how they stand the bump when they go head first into a trench
