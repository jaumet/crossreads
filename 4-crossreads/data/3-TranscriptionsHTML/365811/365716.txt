<p>My dear Judge,<br/>The last Australian mail &ndash; about a fortnight ago brought a letter from you written at Cooma while you were en route for Melbourne per car. And a few days later I received from England the January copy of Current History. Thank you very much for both.</p>
<p>I was down at Moascar attending an AMC officers school for two weeks, recently. I'm afraid I did not gain much knowledge but I managed to fill in the time well enough. Ismailia, about a mile from where we were camped is a very pretty place, on the canal, &amp; boasting a French club, a couple of hotels, a Cinema show &amp; very nice gardens. I was in there most evenings.</p>
<p>The 14th A.G.H. &ndash; the one Australian Gen. Hosp here now, has recently shifted from Cairo to Port Said and I went down there from Moascar for the week end. Port Said is the least attractive of any of the places I've been to in Egypt &ndash; about on a par with Suez or Aden. Theres nothing to see there &amp; nowhere to go except for a sail which means going along the canal &amp; back again &ndash; not at all exciting. Of course you can drive but the only way is along the Kantara Road which runs along</p>
