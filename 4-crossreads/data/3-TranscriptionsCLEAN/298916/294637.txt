 29th October. About ten am the mail boat (a chartered tug) came for letters & delivered those for each transport. Letters were to be left open for the censor. Those letters closed would be delayed a fortnight before being posted. On this tug boat was Major McCall who was the C.O. of 16th Engineers Signal Troop at Victoria Barracks & with which troop I serve. He & numbers of others were to meet on the flagship at noon for the purpose of attending a meeting - the outcome of which was generally the same; Many good intentions. There were several tug boats chartered for the use of the navy & on one boat were two elderly ladies & two girls who evidently intended going the rounds on a pleasure trip. By the look of their faces - green - their dishevelled hair & agonising "wupps" it could be seen that they were far from being happy. One girl lay with her head on a sergeant's knees & another threatened to overbalance but for a grip on her ankles. It was a great sight & all enjoyed it - but from experience we pitied them. Just before lunch the N.Z. transports arrived with H.I.J.M. Ibuki.
