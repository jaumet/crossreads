SEPT.   FRIDAY 1   1916
Fine & fairly warm. I was picked out to drill with the NCOs & drilled under Lieut Hill all morning and was doing a bit of gun laying in afternoon under Warren Hogarth. We were all inoculatd the second time for "para-typhoid" in the afternoon & we all had pretty fair arms at night. Bill & Jack Hunter & Self went up to the picture show at night, but it was not much good.
