<p>too late as they had closed.  I intend going over in the morning for same.<br/>Troops are still moving out &amp; it is anticipated that there will not be any Australians in Egypt after 6 weeks time.<br/>Had a bad night with my cold.</p>
<p>2.4.16 Sunday<br/>Passed another Bad night coughing most of the time.  I rode over to Zeitoun in the morning &amp; procured parcel of Handkerchiefs &amp; Envelopes sent by Mother &amp; which were very acceptable.  We had a bit of amusement to-day with our Buck Jumping Horse.  A Cpl from the 27th A.S.C. came down to ride him &amp; after a tough struggle managed him, although he was thrown pretty heavily once.</p>
<p>There was sensational item of our Division Caused to-day.  The Brigade Troops had to march from Tel-el-Kebir to Serapeum, a distance of 39 miles over the Desert.  The Sun was frightfully hot when they started, &amp; they lost their track on the Desert.  They had all been living (like all of us) on Bully Beef &amp; this makes you very thirsty. The consequence was they ran out of water</p>
