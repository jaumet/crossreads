<p>December 1916<br/>24th    also a fair number of Tommies who are attached to us.<br/>The civil population here is not very big but we are well off for shops &amp; estaminets.<br/>Being Christmas Eve we had a fairly merry time under the circumstances &amp; got to bed about 11 P.M. (our usual bed time is about 6 or 7)<br/>25th   Christmas Day-   It has been fairly quiet but we are getting settled down in our new abode for a while.<br/>Reveille was blown at 7 a.m.  Breakfast at 8, &amp; we fell in for parade at 9 a.m. but were dismissed immediately after the roll call.</p>
