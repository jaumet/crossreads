Tuesday 14 May
Beautiful day, Aeroplane activity has been great to-day to-night.
Fritz has been shelling off on to-day to-night but so far no casualties have resulted. We have spent the day in trying to make our place fairly bomb proof.
Wednesday 15 May
Glorious day things have been very quiet except for desultory shelling round about.
We are still living very well indeed. A very big gas attack is to eventuate shortly here, about 1200 projectors to be sent over. Since in the 8th Battn. has had no stretcher case at all.
