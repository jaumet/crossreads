<p>1916 &nbsp; MONDAY 10 &nbsp; JULY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; showery by turns. We were taken off the &quot;Argyllshire&quot; at 9.15 AM by the tug &quot;Sir Walter Raleigh&quot; &amp; landed at the London &amp; South Western Railway Company&#39;s station where we were put straight into a train &amp; taken to camp at Amesbury, a part of Salisbury Plains. We got out of train at 4.15 pm and marched about 4 miles to camp. We were all glad to get off the old A8 although she had been a good home to us for 60 days. Capt Chicken shook hands with everybody as they left the ship. The journey up was very interesting to all, the prettiest journey I have ever had All the country looked beautiful. We did not enjoy the march out so much as we were very tired &nbsp;The camp is a model though. Huts about 60 ft by 20 &amp; beautifully built and only thirty men in each &nbsp;Picture shows, hot &amp; cold shows post office ect</p>
