<p>Wednesday 28th November 1917</p>
<p>Colder this morning &ndash; but we should feel thankful to be afloat &amp; also well. I had a hateful nightmare last night. I had let my squadron down in a retirement &amp; I felt all the horror of the bullets around me &amp; I rode away &ndash; am I really a cur I wonder &ndash; or is it only liver thro' over eating. 10 days at sea now &amp; only off Portugal. We have men on board who have been torpedoed several times, &amp; their nerves are not of the best. When will it all end I wonder.</p>
