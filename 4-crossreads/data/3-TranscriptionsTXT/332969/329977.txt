our Platoon with Leut Westbrook went out boating over to see the Queen Elizebeth.
Saturday 24.4.15  still on boat
Sunday 25.4.15    About 6 am we got into Destroyers & were taken some distance towards the shore & then got into life boats & were tugged towards the shore with small tug boats then we had to row the rest of the way. I can tell you it was a very exciting time shells were flying every where & some of them were splashing the water over us its a wonder to me that any of us are left to tell the tale.  As the shrapnel was whistling all round us & one of the boys sitting next to me got hit in the thumb. when we rowed close enough to be Beach the officer gave the order to jump out & make for the shore. I made a jump out and found myself in about 3 ft of water. anyway it did not take me very long to reach the sandy beach & I can tell you. I was not last in arriving there we had to run over the sandy beach & get under cover for the shells we busting all round us & plenty of my mates only a few feet away
