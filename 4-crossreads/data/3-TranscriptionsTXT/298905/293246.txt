now comes the funny part of the business, when they got back to their rallying point one of their number was missing, so they went out & searched a couple of hours for him but could not find him anywhere so they came to the conclusion that he had missed them & had gone back but when they got in they found that he was missing,  so they went out again & searched till daylight still no result, so they gave it up & came in thinking the Germans must have captured him, the next night they went out again & searched nearly all night but could not find any trace of him, so they gave him up for lost, the next night he turns up & had a queer tale to tell, it appears when the machine guns started on them
