16/8/16.Left Contay yesterday morning and marched through Albert, a pipe band of the Gordon Highlanders play ahead of my platoon as we marched through the town. Rested some hours in the reserve line. Cold and raining. Then went over a terrible track to the front line, reaching it in the daylight. Of the Pozieres village not a trace remains, and this position on the left of the windmill overlooks Courcelette, so some one has been working while we were away. There is a good deal of shelling going on but happily not much comes our way. I got a bit of sleep in a Hun dugout. There were some very dead huns in it but I did not mind. They had a tunnel to a machine gun emplacement thirty yards long.
