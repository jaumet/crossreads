<p>the rippingest ward of the rippingest hospital in Blighty. We have a piano and lounge to ourselves, and the nurses come in every afternoon or evening to play or sing. Two other wards have also a piano apiece.</p>
<p>I have just sighed another long sigh of content. Each ward also has a small library in addition to the general hospital collection. All Military methods are taboo and napoo. Civilization reigns uninterruptedly. Everything works smoothly. There is no lack of soft pillows and clean linen, and the fancy coverlets for the beds are pretty and pleasing. We each have different coloured slippers and dressing gowns. Warren wheeled me in spinal chair to Church (Hall)</p>
<p>Monday, 30.<br/>Was wheeled down to the town by Waghorne thence to Howard's to be X rayed. 2 plates of back and 1 of left leg taken.</p>
<p>(Several quotations from letters etc. follow).</p>
