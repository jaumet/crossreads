<p>December, 1915</p>
<p>Sunday 5</p>
<p>Never slept a wink all night for the ache of my leg, mostly due to the rotten stretcher.</p>
<p>No hospital ship in so will remain at Clearing Hospital until one comes</p>
<p>Heard <strike>that</strike> no ship nearer than Alexandria.</p>
<p>How heartily I cursed the man responsible for this blunder not on my own account so much as other &amp; worse cases.</p>
<p>There is an amputation opposite me &amp; a loss of sight to the left,</p>
