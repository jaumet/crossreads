Flessells 3/12/16  Some trouble today in the way of claims from people for damage to property.  One dame claims 50 francs for fowls stolen and tells very circumstantial tale of men creeping out of hen yards with fowls under their coats.  Possibly true and we shall have to pay but some of these folk never miss putting in a claim to every unit that comes in.  Some of our chaps are rather careless and think that, like in the bush, they can go out and cut down trees etc for firewood.  The Marquise is much disturbed at the loss of about 40 young trees whose growth he has been very carefully watching.  At one billet the old dame is of a very amorous turn of mind and wishes everyone to sleep with her.  My French is not progressing at all.  Rarely do we get to a place where one can converse with the people and then do not have the time to spare.  Tonight for the first time for a long while I am sitting down to read books.  Generally the daily paper and tactical stuff constitute all my reading matter.  In this little village I do not think there is a single man of military age left - the Army has claimed them all.  How much better is the French organisation than the English! It is very hard to find the way about in this village because the streets wind most erratically.  We now have 3 phonographs which are under the padre (Durshford) and in the men's billets for their use and disposal.  He also has a small organ for sing-songs.
