It is soking into the ground &amp; most of our "dugouts" are suffering<br/>The dump is growing in size &amp; now occupies a fairly large space of ground.  Fritz has been shelling us very freely since last night.  Some have landed very close to us &amp; he is continuing it again to-night.  It is mostly "high explosive" but he gives us some schrapnell occasionally &amp; it is anything but pleasant.<br/>The rain shows signs of clearing off but it is still very cold.</p>
