 Blaney Tronville  - D.A.H.Q. Had a fairly busy day  No lines. Met Bob Bulcher, and a few other old companions including young Craven from the Oaks. Rained hard throughout the day. "Morse Code" looks fairly tired on the strength of his heavy work. Fritz bombed the vicinity with some fairly nice bombs. He is also shelling the roads between Corbie and Fuillory
