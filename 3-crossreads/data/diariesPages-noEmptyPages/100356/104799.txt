Spent all the morning running about on the bus after petrol horses etc went down to the remount depot found that our horses would be ready at 12 but when we lobbed at 12 the rotters told us to come again at 3, when we finally got them had quite a circus on the way home, horses everywhere, preparations going on apace for the morrow when the Brigadier is inspecting troops who move out on the following day. Aeroplanes up all the afternoon we had the check to gallop over their aerodrome but nothing doing as they happened to be Tommys. Matthew left us today took up his new job, wrote letters, met Bill Chatham this morning in all his importance only not feeling quiet to comfortable in his new role as Sig officer to the 3rd Bde.
