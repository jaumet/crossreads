I sent an orderly with a note to Col Agnew in hopes he would be able to stop the Captain coming ashore - For he is a very busy man - and it was blowing and bitterly cold - well, I was ready at the hour appointed with the other sisters and went down to the South pier in an ambulance with all our luggage. Capt Tyler & Lt Col Worsley came ashore and I met them. However they were as usual very charming and stayed and talked at the pier for some time. Then I suggested they should go to Col Agnews quarters and ask for tea - which they did - we did not go on board that night - waiting in the cold and dark for the lighter. Major Smith took us back and gave us soup & cocoa in their mess tent and we unpacked our rugs and turned into bed in our dismantled huts. It was a freezing night - but an orderly filled our hot water bags. We came on board here for breakfast at 10am. The Matron and sisters on this ship have been very kind treating us
