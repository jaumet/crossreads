Heavy fighting everywhere to-day, our artillery horses have landed & from Walkers Ridge they can see the Artillery galloping into action, our advance still continues on both flanks & we are doing all we can to keep as many  many  troops engaged on our front as possible.  The L.H. charge yesterday was only for the purpose of  get  keeping a large quantity of Turks here, apparently the Turks expected the main attack from here.  The Ghurkhas & Maoris & Sikhs have reached the foot of hill 971 (their objective).
