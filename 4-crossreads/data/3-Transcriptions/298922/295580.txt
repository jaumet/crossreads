<p>Wednesday 26th September</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]<br/>If my Bronchitis is no better I shall try &amp; get "boarded" for Australia from England, others are doing it so why should not I. Of course I hardly expect such luck but I <u>don't</u> want to go back at present. I may feel different after being away another month.</p>
<p>My Papers came today &amp; I'm really off tomorrow, all very secret &amp; no name of boat mentioned. I shall be glad of the chance of seeing something of ITALY. Left Alex Sept. 27 wire Cable on arrival.</p>
