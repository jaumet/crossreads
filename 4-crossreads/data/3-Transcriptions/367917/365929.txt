<p>movements and experiments, and particularly at a time like the present am I loathe to go very far away from them. Just what I may do after three years of solid and I hope satisfactory study at Oxford I do not now care to predict, but I am certainly looking forward to at least a trip out to Sydney within the next few years.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear that Keith was making good general progress and I see from [indecipherable] that he is taking quite an active part in the Varsity life. No doubt it will take some years before he quite recovers, but his recovery will probably be hastened now that there is no need for him to have at the back of his mind any thoughts of a return to warfare conditions.</p>
<p>I hope to be able to write to Dorothy this week as I have owed her a letter for eight weeks. Even when I return to B.E.F. I may be able to continue with the job of replying to a file of unanswered letters, for although the 4[indecipherable] Army, in which I was, is going to the Rhine, I fail to see the need for hurrying forward of balloons to those regions particularly at this time of year.</p>
<p>I will write again before long and let you know my doings &amp; plans. My afft. regards to Mrs. Ferguson, Dorothy, Keith &amp; yourself.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>[indecipherable]</p>
