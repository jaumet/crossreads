<p>And the click of the swing gates meeting.</p>
<p>3.<br/>Give me the scents of the Bush again<br/>In the good grey land down under<br/>The scent of the red gums after rain<br/>When the ridges roll with thunder<br/>The reek of the dust when the scrubbers ring.<br/>In the trampled yard wings turning<br/>The scent of a sandal bush in Spring<br/>And the smell of a box log burning!</p>
<p>4.<br/>Give me the sun swept plains immense<br/>Where the countless herrds are feeding.<br/>The shimmering line of a five wire fence<br/>To the rim of the world receeding<br/>Give me the long unmeasured track<br/>And the far untrodden spaces.<br/>The peace &amp; rest of the plains outback<br/>And the width of the warm Bush places</p>
<p>Will Ogilvie.</p>
<p>Home Weary.</p>
<p>[Shorthand transcribed as follows]<br/>Says the Sydney "Club" the [indecipherable] this, Will Ogilvie will soon be back from his native Scotland to the land of wide spaces, of fair women and grey horses.  [end of shorthand]<br/>1.<br/>Give me the sights of the bush to see<br/>That I only see in dreaming;<br/>The silver moon on a gangyall tree,<br/>The Sun on a sandhill gleaming;<br/>The dip &amp; lurch of a ten ton load<br/>As it swings through a Western clearing,<br/>The dust of a mob on the open road,<br/>Through the scattered salt-bush steering.</p>
<p>2.<br/>Give me the sounds of the Bush to hear<br/>The bells of the horses jingling;<br/>The Magpies carolling sweet &amp; clear<br/>And the laughing jackass wrangling,<br/>The clang of a sliprail dropped in place<br/>The drum of a bare hoof beating,<br/>The clatter of sheep in the drafting rail</p>
