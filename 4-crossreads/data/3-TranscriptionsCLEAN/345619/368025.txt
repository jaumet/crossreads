  
 On Active Service 3/3/17 My Dear Ruth Thank you very much indeed for the box of cigarettes which reached me safely amidst the shot & shell at a time when I had run out of smokes, so you can imagine how thankful I was to get them. 
 I am still alright & in good health, but have had many narrow escapes at times. Give my love to your Mother & Granma & Mrs Charlie & say I often think of the time I spent at Rooty Hill with you all 
 Yours sincerely Horace C Lovegrove
