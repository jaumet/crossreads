<p>Dear Father</p>
<p>Havent had any letter from you lately.  I dare say it shall come along shortly.  Have <strike>ing</strike> been hoping you would write &amp; let me know what Bert was attached to.  I believe the troops at Liverpool have been making things pretty lively in Sydney from letters received in camp here.  I posted a parcel to you a few days ago.  A belt of numeral's also a small box a bit of Egyptian work.  I thought it would be a bit of a novelty for the Smith girls.  I leave it to you what you do with the things numerals etc.  I expect you will be rushed for them for hat pins.  Well Father there is absolutely no news I can give you this time.  Don't be surprised if there aren't any letters from me for a while.  I will write whenever I get a chance.  I can't say any more you will understand.  Of coarse I may be abel to write each week &amp; I may not.</p>
