<p>1918<br/>Aug 8<br/>grew on for "Zero" our excitement increased and those who had watches began to consult them. The tanks lumbered on past us, some going right ahead, and others forming up just in front of our trench. At 4.20am to the tick, the barrage opened. I never expect to hear the like again. The dropping shells covered a space of 6,000 yards in depth, by a length, (I suppose) of 10 to 15 miles. There was one gun just behind us, that I could hear firing, as it nearly deafened us every time it went off, but the remainder could only be heard as one tremendous roar mingling with the whistle of the shells overhead. The machine guns were well ahead of us so could not be heard. It caught Fritz napping and he did not reply for a while, but before long, shells began to burst near us and the heavier stuff could be heard bursting back from us. This continuous roar lasted for one hour without cessation. At 5.15am we hopped over the top and formed up on our tape, behind our tanks. I was only just out of the trench</p>
