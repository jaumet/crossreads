<p>30.9.15<br/>Table Top at 10 oclock: The warboats were fairly busy at intervals during the night giving the Turks trenches opposite Walkers &amp; Popes a rough time: Went for a dip this afternoon the weather has become quite mild again; at 4 oclock this afternoon the warboats opened fire in the Achi-Baba again &amp; one would think by the noise that a violent storm was approaching from the South; Beachy Willie which has been silenced the last few days again started to-day &amp; is causing some commotion at Anzac, a hospital boat leaves here on an average of about 1 per day with sick &amp; wounded (principally sick) We are on duty every night in the firing trench &amp; have a very steep hill to go over to get to our post:: The batteries in all the phones here are about to run out &amp; they do not work too well &amp; we cannot get the new ones in here</p>
