<p>tremendously hot with full kit up travelling in this hot weather May have to put up with worse yet down in that Canal Area  What is in store for us?</p>
<p>5th May <strike>Thursday</strike>.Friday.1916 Sohag.</p>
<p>About 21 men went away today to the Artillery somewhere in the Canal Zone. They have left the Regt for good. They are the best we have got. Sergeants Locke, Galloway Uhlmann, Ferris-Scott. And some from C Squadron at Assuit Corpl McDougall my signalling Corporal of B Squadron has also gone. Balderson and Phillips two more signallers went as well. We are now <strike>Is </strike> I should imagine a supply regiment to make up deficiencies of other units. Those of us who are imbued with a feeling of "pride of regiment" very much regret all this. One does not care how soon ones own turn comes but were for many months a splendid regiment and we have done good service as such but now! Nuf sed!</p>
