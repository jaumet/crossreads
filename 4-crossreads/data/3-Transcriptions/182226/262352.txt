<p>Friday 26 November, 1915</p>
<p>Money running short again, it&#39;s a hard world! Fortunately it is pay day so we will be able to restore our financial position to its former glory (10/- each?)</p>
<p>I went out to see my girl at Pieta. Sid took his over to Sliema so I did not see him again that night.&nbsp;He went out to camp but I dossed in the usual place.</p>
