9th August:- WednesdayEvery indication of a fine day as we leave home but towards midday turns out cloudy & cold & threat of rain. This does not deter us from pursuing our tour of the suburbs & take a tram to Boisguillaine after work. From here another fine view of the town is obtainable & in a different direction from Bonsecours. A fine monument of ernormous size is erected near here, represting the industries of France. Owing to the war the fountain display attached to it is not working   Spending the evening with a long chat at home, with the object of improving my French.
