 extending along the shore. For some time the actual harbour could not be seen, it being a large breakwater running parallel to the shore.  Accomodation very  liberal  limited this perhaps being the reason of the transports coming singly.  Our escort left us when we entered the harbour &amp; rapidly disappeared from sight to take up no doubt more of the tiring work of patrolling.  The chief object of interest noticed in the town from afar is a large church with a golden figure on its highest point.  It is built on a high hill &amp; looks down upon the surrounding town.  An island standing in front of the town appeared to be well fortified but is probably obsolete.  An appearance of lifelessness was to be seen everywhere just sufficient being done to keep things going.  Women were employed on the wharves with the men doing most of the light work.  My first impression of Marseilles is that tis' not so large a place or important as I imagined it was the harbour being especially disappointing.
