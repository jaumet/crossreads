There is a charm about this General for those who know him that would send them through hell for his sake. A leader of men! Spent the afternoon quietly and then after mess had a conference of the officers commanding companies and discussed the march today. Caustically caned up Mackinnon for being late. Discussed the plans for our Brigades hopover in conjunction with the 4th Division. Moved down to a new and good billet further down the road feeling very unwell went to bed early. My batman Charlesworth got influenza today and O.P. Hunt took over in his place. Once more into the breach. The ?flu epidemic continues to grow. Our new doctor had a very busy time today.
