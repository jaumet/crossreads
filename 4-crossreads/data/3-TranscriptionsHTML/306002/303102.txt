<p>7.4.15<br/>Wed. 7th.  Another Regimental scheme to-day &amp; had a good time of it;  we were working by the pumping station, &amp; had dinner there arrived back in camp about 3 oclock.  The supply of tucker has fallen off the last few days, &amp; we appear to have a short allowance now;  leave was granted for Cairo to-night, &amp; Nelson has taken advantage of it &amp; gone in.  Nelson has been working with H.Q. the last couple of days &amp; "Penny" &amp; I have been working C Sqd. on our own.</p>
