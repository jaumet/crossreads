  
 cot and ten walking cases, so here again our anticipations were upset, leaving us still practically empty until we reach Port Said which is our next port of call. 
 October 27th: - A fearfully windy day during which rain fell heavily at times making it almost impossible to stay on deck for any length of time. 
 On ward duty in the morning but off for afternoon and night; the latter fortunately was perfect after 8 pm when the rain cleared off suddenly. 
 October 28th: - A glorious day throughout. Ship travelled at a great pace all day in perfectly smooth waters. Slept on deck. 
 October 29th: - Similar to the previous day, it being perfect. On ward duties all day but not very busy. 
 October 30th: - Arrived at Port Said at 7 am, the morning being fine & clear. Took aboard 30 convalescent patients all of whom were sent to Wards F1 & 2. 
 Sailed at 1 pm and at 1-15 pm we entered the famous Canal in which were passed several large steamers. 
 At 11 pm we anchored in the salt lake and remained there until 5 am as our ship had no headlight. 
 October 31st: - Sailed on at 5 am & at 12 o'clock we arrived at Suez where we cast anchor. 
 Divine Service in morning and at 2 pm a joyous event took place for our mail was received; 47 letters was my lot along with a dozen papers & the boys were in wild delight for the rest of the day.
