<p>12.4.18<br/>Lovely day.  Up at 7 and gradually got mobile at 10, marching order and then cleaned up billets.  Moved off at 11 and marched with numerous rests with pack up past Longchamps and a big R.N.A.S. [Royal Navy Air Service] aerodrome.  Stopped at 1 just outside Amiens and had tea for our dinner.  Hot tea at 5 and during wait several went down for a swim and rest of us watched aeroplane scraps.  Not moving till dark.  Played bridge again till light failed.  Just before full darkness a good few Fritz's bombers came over and started bombing Amiens.  About 4 fires were started and one incendiary shell dropped.  Searchlights picked up about 3 planes and they got a warm reception from A.A. [Anti-aircraft] guns &amp; M.G.  Two fine parachute flares were then dropped after bombing the station and approaches, the planes must have seen our transport.  One big bomb dropped only about 50 yards away making a hole in chalk 50 feet across and wounded a W.O. [Warrant Officer] &amp; Sergeant of A.M.C. [Army Medical Corps] passing by on horseback.  8 more smaller bombs were dropped making holes about 15 feet on cross roads near our transport and wounded two of our horses.  Just before these bombs were dropped</p>
