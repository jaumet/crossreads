<p>[New letter written on YMCA paper]<br/>Oxford<br/>England<br/>13-8-1918</p>
<p>Arrived here this morning, very weary with the travelling, and still am weary so won't write much, tomorrow I ought to be fresher. I am in a beautiful place, "The Examination Hall" it is called, I suppose of the University.</p>
<p>I must now send my change of address to the Army Post Office, as there are sure to be some Aussie letters along soon. Love to my little kids &amp; you from<br/>Your husband.</p>
