Para 1 Reordered
The ruling of the Q M Q in the attached letter makes it clear that replacements can only be made for losses under the approval of the Army Commander.
The Corp Commander is prepared to recommend the replacement of lost revolvers only in cases where Commanding Officers have complied strictly with Army Corp Routine order No192. No other cases will be considered when replacements are claimed for revolvers lost.
Commanding officers will only only require an officer to hand over his revolver in very special circumstances where considered absolutely necessary.
