<p>Dear Mrs Fry</p>
<p>I am very sorry indeed to have to tell you of the death of your son 1340 L.Cpt. Fry, 13 Bat., Australian imperial Forces, who died here this morning from the result of abdominal wounds. He was brought in here very badly wounded and in a very collapsed condition, but though the surgeon and sisters did all they possible could for him he never improved, &amp; died at 6.45 A.M. this morning. He will be buried in the Village Cemetery of Warloy by our chaplain. With deepest sympathy  T.M. Whyte Sister.</p>
