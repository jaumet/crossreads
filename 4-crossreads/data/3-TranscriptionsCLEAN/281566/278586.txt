We rested at Delville Wood until Monday 6th Nov when we again shifted up  &  in the vicinity of the line relieving No 1 Gun on the following Wednesday.

German artillery was exceptionally busy on the night of the 8th  &  early on the morning of the 9th as a prelude to a days heavy bombardment our light batteries set up a heavy barrage on the enemy line.
