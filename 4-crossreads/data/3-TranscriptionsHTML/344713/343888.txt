Have gone out &amp; made a new front line in front of us. Yesterday when Fritz made a new advanced firing line our bombers <strike>whe</strike> went out in broad daylight &amp; bombed him out of it.<br/>Got buried &amp; had a few abrasions today but still O.K.<br/>Relieved tonight by A &amp;B Coys &amp; are now just behind in support trench.<br/>"Fritz" bombarded us all last night &amp; kept it up pretty well today. Trenches are not much protection against well-directed H.E. but it is some satisfaction to know that "Fritz" is getting his issue too.<br/>All going well this afternoon as "Fritz" was in a little too far with his range on us &amp; the shells were bursting about 100 yds. behind when unluckily one of the shells in flight hit a tree of the grove in front of line.<br/>We got the whole explosion &amp; tree on top of our bay &amp; the result</p>
