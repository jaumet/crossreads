<p>6th August.<br/>The cellar we slept in, was underneath a ruined cottage, we cleared out one of the rooms, secured a few articles of furniture, &amp; lived fairly comfortable for a few hours. We also enjoyed some good tucker &ndash; fried bacon, steak, &amp; potato chips.</p>
<p>At 7 p.m. another move is made for the reserve trenches, which were situated about a mile from that famous village which the Australians drove Fritz out of on the 24th. April last. The Bearers slept in the trenches for the night, fortunately the weather had cleared up the previous night, so our conditions could have been much worse.</p>
<p>7th. August.<br/>We live in the reserve trenches all the day, &amp; at 11.15 p.m. we receive our last orders, &amp; move off towards the support trenches in rear of our Brigade.  Several times the support trenches in rear of our Brigade. Several times we got lost &amp; wandered about for a considerable time. This sort of caper, carrying gear &amp; stretchers on a dark night on the Battlefield, is not the game its cracked up  to be.  Passed a number of tanks in our travels. Eventually arrived at the support trenches at 3.30 a.m. Two miles in four hours rather quick walking "I don't think". Of course every one was very near</p>
