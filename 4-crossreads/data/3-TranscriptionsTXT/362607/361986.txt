 15.10.17 Dear George, A P.C. to let you know that we are both doing well. I met Jack Powell last Saturday night in the Council Chambers at Salisbury. He was just returning from Duty in France. He is over in England on 6 months Duty. I have to go out all day To-Morrow on Duty. I will take the Bike because all the Camps are at least 3 miles from the Railway. I like walking but it takes too long. We are going to the theatre tonight. I have booked our seats for Peg 'O My Heart. We have bonzer theatre shows sometimes. How is the Surf this Year? It is over 2 years nearly since I had a surf dip. I had a lot of "dailies" given me by Wal Patterson from Brookvale. He was going up to see  Wal Parker at Oxford when I saw Him last Saturday. Have not met Eric Merrett yet. Met Alec Ross from Manly the other day too. But you do not know him I suppose. Well George, I'll have to buzz off. Best of Love to You all  Harry X
