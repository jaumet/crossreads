CairoJune 3rd 1919
My dear wife & twice Mother by the gifts of God and humble co-operation.
We are again to become Heroes - I use the plural advisedly, but not in the same sense as used by Royalty nor by the little boy with a worm but in the sense that I am with you or rather what is left of me is with you and the boys included.  The sense of duty w of duty is a personality in itself and I am really going up with it to see that it does its best.
Two hefty henchmen, tried & hardbitten scouts, go with me so I am alright & possibly will regain my health & optimism.
I would like to rub my beard against your very soft cheek by way of benediction but bully & biscuit will have to do.
I leave Cairo within two hours returning from the blue within two weeks.
Yours EverG.W. Lambert
