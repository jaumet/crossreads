The transport sailed at 10 A.M. Alexandria is a busy port crowded with ships. The ship is under convoy and the fact that we have to always wear our lifebelts remind us that we are in the war zone. The submarines are bad just about here.

The torpedo boat "Rattlesnake" came alongside this morning, and we picked up our escort soon after; it is a small cruiser. I saw a fleet of minesweepers at work and the escort lead us through the swept area. We are sailing by a great mountainous island there is much snow on the tops of the mountains. A ships officer tells me it is the island of Crete. I looks very pretty this evening.
