<p>March 1917<br/>9th.   I continued with my same job today &amp; have made considerable progress with the consolidation of Bull's Eye dugouts.  Fritz shelled us heavy this morning &amp; again this evening.   The weather has been very cold, but the sky is clear &amp; Fritz's observation over our lines has been at its best.<br/>At about 3 P.M. it started to snow again, &amp; continued through the night.<br/>10th.   We had more snow this morning but the sky cleared up about noon &amp; about 3 P.M. Fritz opened up heavily onto "Needle Dump."  We received the news to-day that Count Zeplin died, the day before yesterday.</p>
