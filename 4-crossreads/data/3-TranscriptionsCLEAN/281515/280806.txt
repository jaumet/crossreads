one of our officers got a tin of Petrol & spread it all over the ambulance & the Huns & set fire to it & burnt the lot & got rid of the beastly smell of dead Huns.
Our first night was the worst I remember, as we had not been in the trenches very long when we all put to improve the trenches by digging a bit deeper.  shell fire was very constant & in the next bay to where I was with 4 others, there were, one officer four stretcher bearers & 2 signallers,a shell came & got the lot (wounded) the officer got wounded through both wrists & the others in different parts of the body    well all had to be bandaged up as best we could, that left 4 of us one sentry who got blown down off the firing step & two others who had shell shock one chap was crawling on his Hands & knees saying Oh where am I, where am I, & the other one was silent & like a drunken man, useless of course to me
there I was on my pat, with two shell shocks & a sentry who did not know where he was either    I thanked God when day light came as the trenches were being flattened out as once I looked over the top to see what which direction the shells were coming from & there were flashes from directly in front & from the right flank & when daylight came what was left of us were taken out & moved to a trench which was a new one & put there to reinforce some other men of another Battalion they were only 33 strong out of a company & we were 14 so that made 47 in this trench & we were close
