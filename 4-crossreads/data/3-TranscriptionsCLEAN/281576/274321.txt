Behold in me, alas! a stretcher Bearer,In Sunny France, O horrid tranceOf all the mud & shells a wretched sharer,Ah! Ambulance.  Curse my mischanceWhen out on greasy duckboards slippingIn Trenches wet; And dry - [pertet?] Clammy water from my tunic drippingNo issue Rum - my sole regret.
With a cling, clang, crash BangComes another shellMakes me think, with Dante, I'm in - wellMy head is plastered thick with mudGood God, here comes another dud,I wish I was in Blighty,Where they treat the dinkums well.
Once again behold in me a war worn Failure,My arm, O Lor: Effects of War I'm bound, O how I hope for dear AustraliaEncore: Encore.  Tres biens, messieur.I've swung the Lead with skill & great precisionMy Fate is nigh.  But hope is high.And now, with dread await the Board's decision.Hi, tiddly, Hi.  I'll ne'er say die.
With a crook wing I sing, to the BoardMy Tale of woeIt's bound to get round the Doctor's Hearts I know.And if I once get on the BoatBound for Home for which I dote,I promise you, fair dinkumThat from Home I'll never go.
