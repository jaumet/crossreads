<p>No good being frightened of them as Josh Billings would say "If yer gits em yer gits em" and that's all about it. I heard a fellow say recently "If your name and address is on em you'll get them".<br/>This special patrol which has come out has orders to go to the Wadi El Arish South of Gel Arish itself and will go inside the enemys lines &ndash; and ask for water several engineers have accompanied them. They are going on a very dangerous mission I wish them luck.</p>
<p>6th December 1916 Gerarat Wednesday</p>
<p>Mail day. Got 3 papers. I was ordered to go out at 6 this morning on a special patrol in support of Captain Brown's patrol which left last night and had everything ready but later it was cancelled the 3rd Light Horse were doing it. Have been eagerly searching the horizon all day for signs of the patrol which went out last night up to now &ndash; no signs. (2 pm)<br/>Our cook Smythe has gone away as cook to the A.I.F. Canteen Staff back at Railhead and we had Watts from C Squadron in his place but he has no love for the job and he went this morning.</p>
