<p>1919<br/>Aug. 21<br/>familiar scenery.  Hardly a man, I suppose, but glanced at Liverpool Camp as we went through and thought of the time when he was a raw recruit there, three or four years before.  The train whistles heralded our arrival with "Cock a doodle doos".  We reached Central Station about 3.30 p.m. pulling in to one of the Illawarra Line platforms.<br/>Cars were waiting to take us to the Anzac Buffet in the domain.  Mum and Aunt Nellie were waiting at the rails for me.  Patty could not say much and neither could I.  I gave them my bag and went on.  Eric was waiting further on.  Ron Mawson, Nora Forsyth and a lot of 30th Bn. men.  Private Mountcastle &ndash; now Nora's husband showed me where to go.  I signed up a few papers, told the Doctor I felt OK, and that my teeth were all right, and got right through in 10 minutes.  I came out again to be hugged by Mum and photographed by Eric, now grown to quite a young man about town.</p>
