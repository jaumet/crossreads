Rain seems to have set in this evening it is blowing howling outside a treat, but I am quite comfortable sitting in our well appointed billiard room in a nice easy chair beside a good coal fire, I am just counting the days now till we get our trip home to "Aussie." I see the 1st 4th Divisions have just put up another splendid stunt the papers are giving our splendid troops great praise, I wonder how Len is getting on he will be in all this heavy fighting.
