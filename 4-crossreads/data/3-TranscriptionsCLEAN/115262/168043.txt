  
 Wednesday 3 October 1917. 
 4 Taubes over at 10.30 a.m. Persisted in their reconnoitering and shelled very closely at times. Hundreds of shells fired at them. At times when over our position they flew low, pieces of shell landing in our lines and roundabout. 
 As shells burst the pieces sang through the air above our heads. All took to dugouts. Natives frightened out of their wits. Expect air raid tonight from all accounts.
