<p>P.S. I'm so glad your delighted at my love affair &amp; only wish you could meet him.</p>
<p>I'm missing him terribly but there is a good time coming.  Fancy poor Capt. Smedley sent me a little note this morning, on his way to Cairo.  He was going to Hospital there.  He had been camped somewhere near Port Said, but shall get a letter from him in a day or so, explaining things.</p>
<p>I'm afraid he is ill again.  Funny I had a nice letter from his sweatheart yesterday from England.  She is a pal of mine &amp; a jolly pretty girl.</p>
<p>Love<br/>Edith</p>
