<p>The respirator is carried in a haversack at the side &amp; troops at the front are never without it.  When in use it is slung round the neck in front of the body, it consists of a mask that fits over the face in an airtight manner with a mouth piece &amp; nose clip inside;  we breathe in &amp; out through the mouth piece &amp; the air coming in has to come through a tin of different chemicals which purifies it.  The air that is breathed out gets away through another channel by way of a rubber safety valve which will not let any air come in.  One other thing used for gas is what is known as the P.H. helmet which is rearly only a flannel bag with eye pieces in &amp; a mouth piece through which you breathe out &amp; the air that is breathed in has to come through the flannel which is chemicalised, this helmet is also absolute proof against all gases</p>
