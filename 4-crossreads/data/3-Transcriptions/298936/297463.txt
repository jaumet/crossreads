<p>Wednesday 3</p>
<p>Letter from Rita/photo have arrived.</p>
<p>Shell Green dressing Stat</p>
<p>First case in morning: a man shot with high explosive through shin.</p>
<p>Returning thru gully at foot of Green when a 75 burst over Artillery Rd. sending pellets all round me. Calls from all parts for stretcher bearers &amp; doctors.  Major Butler famous for charging with Infantry  ( vide Australian Press at time of landing) was working near me &amp; he was unhurt  while two men near him were wounded.  One of our men at Artillery Rd. wounded. Pellets struck ground a foot from me later &ndash; luck holds.</p>
