 I have one 75 shell for you don't know yet about the helmet, I think I promised Mr. Hyman first. 
 Believe Dr & Mrs. Fiaschi are in London, think he took a risk coming over at his age.   There are no old men or women here.   The work is too tiring.   Dr. Defage does a big abdo [abdominal] case in less than an hour.
