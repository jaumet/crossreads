Major Heane has arrived back in camp and I put it on him for leave to get my teeth done but nothing ever came of it. Got a parcel from Bill and a sheepskin from Aunt PrisThe xmas one from home has not hit here yet and I don't suppose it will either.Went on leave with a pass this time, and came back under escort so here I am in durance while awaiting trial but I had a fair time and hope to have many another
17.1.16 Went before the Colonel this morning and was handed out a nice long lecture and 10 FP No 2, which is no joke
