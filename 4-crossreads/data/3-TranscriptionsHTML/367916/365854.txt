<p>France<br/>12/6/18.</p>
<p>Dear Judge,<br/>Just a little note to let you know everything is going O.K. Your chocolate turns up very regularly and it is very much welcomed. Does me fine for iron rations when everything else goes.</p>
<p>I am still on the old iddy-umpty job and it is still as interesting as before.</p>
<p>My sig sgt. has been sent over to England to get a commission and also my corporal in my platoon before I got this job has been awarded his for gallantry on the field. We have Geoff Street with us now and the Sydneians now number 7 in the mess.</p>
<p>The old bn. is going as strong as ever. Raked in a few MC's and mentions in</p>
