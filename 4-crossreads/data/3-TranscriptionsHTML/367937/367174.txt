<p>I wrote to Aunt Katie from the boat; hope she got it.<br/>We get a paper here every morning "The Egyptian Times" but there is absolutely no news in it.  I will send you a copy later on if I get a chance.<br/>I am not going to spend any money on post cards or souvenirs of Egypt; the photos I take are more interesting I think don't you?<br/>Please give my regards to Mr Radcliff &amp; Florrie Love to Aunt Katie.<br/>What sort of time did you have at midwinter?<br/>Cold I suppose I wish I was!<br/>I am your loving brother<br/>Robert C Wilson</p>
