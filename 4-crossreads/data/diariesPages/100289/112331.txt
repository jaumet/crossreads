very "fed up" with this life.
Sunday 7.4.18 to Sunday 5.5.18.
Went on leave from 8th.4.18 to 11.4.18 which time I spent in London. Very quiet in London compared with ordinary times owing to no men being on leave from France.
Visited a few of the theatre's "Box of Tricks" at Hippodrome, "Bing Boys on Broadway" at Adelphi Colliseum. Had a quiet though fairly enjoyable few days Have received quite a lot of mail from home during past month, have also met Alf Wells "Barney" Weil. Things in general very quiet here in depot as
