Aeroplane reconnaissence of today reports that troops of the enemy are still in their old positions if anything El-Salmana is strengthened. All ready to move out at a minutes notice tonight.
Left camp at 1000 instead of 0400 tomorrow first of all got in our wrong position in the column, when they moved off eventually they went in the wrong direction missed Katia, the trip was an awful one, cold tiring I was asleep on several occasions on my horse.
Heard all sorts of rumors of the boys in France but don't attach much importance to them for they are only furphies, Chevaul led us on the march is just the same as ever.
