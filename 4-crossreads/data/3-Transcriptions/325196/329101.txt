<p>up by English &amp; Aust. soldiers into a street, a few shots were fired &amp; 9 of the Egyptian reserves were killed but everything was very quiet tonight.</p>
<p>31-1-16<br/>Mon 31st<br/>This morning I left Stan just before breakfast, went to the A.V.C. to see Arthur &amp; Bottomly, &amp; then went to Maadi &amp; saw Les Regan. Ted Oates &amp; Mabray &amp; came back to Wardan by the 5 oclock train &amp; heard another version of the demonstration yesterday &amp; a more probable one; it is said that the Egyptian Reserve were called up for the Camel Corps. they paraded before the Sultans Palace making a demonstration, they said they objected to Australian Officers over them &amp; wanted their own officers &amp; they dispersed quietly after the Sultan had spoken to them</p>
