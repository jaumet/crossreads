<p>I really am sorry that I have not sent p.c.'s to all my friends this year but On Active Service in France is very different to Cairo. One cannot buy any cards, &amp; papers unless you walk miles &amp; then very poor quality. Also I'm afraid I've got lazy. I shall try &amp; write a few lines to them some future day. <br/>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all &amp; hope you will have good-luck. Fancy T.R's. paying a   <u>Div</u>   Hope will repeat the dose. Send me summer weight long-sleeves combinations (wool) about three pairs please. Must wear wool here &amp; find it hard to get.<br/>From,                                                                                                                                                                           Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                         Edith.</p>
