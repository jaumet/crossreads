  
 pleasing to notice how this glorious advance has cheered the AUSTRALIANS up. Even the poor fellows in the Infantry have lost that discontented look & seem merry & bright. These fellows deserve all the honour & praise we can give them in this terrible struggle.  They have at last got Fritz with his tail down, & are still pushing him back. At 2 p.m. we received orders that we would move on again next morning, we have come a good distance already, it must be close on twelve miles. The country surrounding the town was looking very fine. The barbed wire entanglements scattered about the fields stretched over 3/4 of a mile in places & between 30 & 40 feet wide, but this did not hinder our advancing troops. All wells, & food stuffs lying about must not be toucher, in case of it being poisoned. Our squad consisting of Corpl Marlow, E. Calfe, Pat Eagan & myself, spent another quiet night, discovered another comfortable dug-out & all slept like a log. 
 March 19th. A beautiful spring morning. Arose at 7 a.m. & took a walk through the town.
