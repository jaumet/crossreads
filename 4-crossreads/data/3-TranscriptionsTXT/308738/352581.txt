 A Realistic Account of the Landing of the Australian Troops at a Dardanelles Sunday 25th April 1915 
 Half a boats length half a boats length onward Nobly our brave boys forced the shores and landed 
 Up the Steep Up the steep Dashed our heroic Australians Machine Guns in front of them Wire entanglements around them Vainly impede their way 
 Storm the heights Storm the eHeights Show the Turks how Colonals fight Proud of the colors you bear Proud of the khaki you wear Brave of Deed &ndash; Swift as steed Onward &amp; Upward Dashing Australians 
 Up the Cliffs Up the Cliffs Onward Stormed our Battalion Flashed all their bayonets bare In the bright sunlight &amp; glare Oh the Brave Dash they made And the Dear Life they gave Oh the rich Blood they paid And the great victory they gained Noble Colonals 
 That was the way it was done That's how the heights were won Theres not a mothers son Faltered or failed. Out for the Empires good Firm was their trust in God Bravo Australians
