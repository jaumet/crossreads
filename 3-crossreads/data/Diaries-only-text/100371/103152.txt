Tuesday Sept 11th Changeable weather fixing up about furlough, was paid. head bad tonight, no arrivals tonight. 
Wednesday lovely day, we left camp at 8.45AM for our furlough, caught 10 AM train to Waterloo arrived there about 3 PM then marched to Horseferry Rd received our ration allowance (4/- a day). 
We were very disappointed at Weymouth as we put in for our 14 days furlough but was only granted 6 days, we may later on be granted the balance.
