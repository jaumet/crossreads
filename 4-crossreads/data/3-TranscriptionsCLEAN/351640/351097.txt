  
 26-10-15. 8 p.m. More than elven months have passed since the Kyarra left Sydney (24-11-15), here am I in the good ship Demosthenes on the Mediterranean sea approaching the port of Alexandria. All going well we should be safely at the wharf early on the morrow. 
 If such happy ending comes of the voyaging of an eventful three weeks, this letter will be dropped in the post, that account may in due course be with you of some of my experiences midst the scenes of peace and war. 
 How little did my mind ever anticipate that my eyes in old age should look upon Egypt the Isles of Greece, mongst them the sacred Island of Lemnos, European Turkey, and be witness to such sights as came within their scope at Lemnos. Let me hope that my words have, in some manner, given to you idea of war as it is waged under modern conditions, and in what degree your countrymen have borne themselves. 
 Of one thing be sure, you and all those native born to Australia  may  have just cause for pride in the prowess, as fighting men, of those native to your country. Your prayers should assail high heaven that God may deal leniently with their offences, & grant to them the highest reward that the brave deserve. To M. M. Dominic & your Sisters my best regards & wishes. To you tons of love & loads of kisses from Your loving & affectionate father John. B. Nash.
