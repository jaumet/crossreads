<p>Thursday June 23rd<br/>Raining nearly all day. The draft which was picked yesterday, is in full working order, equipped, &amp; ready to leave for France any time. Owing to a misunderstanding a few of us did not fall in when the bugle blew at 3 pm. Result, all put on gardening fatigue. It rained just after &amp; we had to knock off, everyone that did fall in had to stop out in the rain, until the roll was called etc, so we had the best end of the stick after all. Put on guard at the orderly room 5 pm this evening.</p>
<p>Friday June 22nd<br/>Done guard till 5 am <strike>this morning</strike> &amp; 9 &ndash; 11 this morning &amp; 3 &ndash; 5 this afternoon. Received fourteen letters from Australia this afternoon, including 3 from home &amp; four from my sister. Very quiet on guard. There is a concert on tonight, but I have too many letters to answer to go. Did not write letters. Went to concert: Very good.</p>
<p>Saturday June 23rd<br/>Put on Quartermasters fatigue, very easy job, only worked about twenty minutes. It is a bit cold today. Down at the Y.M.C.A. playing billiards, bobs, &amp; bagatelle all the afternoon, had a very decent time. Draft finally examined, &amp; paid this afternoon they are leaving tomorrow morning at 7 am. I will be sorry when they go, as every one that is out of this hut is very decent fellows, they are absolutely the best I have met.</p>
