Things are fairly quiet here this afternoon although a pretty strenuous bombardment was waged this morning by both sides. Good news is still filtering through. I have heard that a large Australian mail has arrived so am looking forward to it with interest as it seems to be rather a long time since I received a mail.

The weather is once more fine, but it is the dying flutter as we now only have one more brief month of good weather then the winter starts , but I`m hanged if I know where it will finish. There is a wretched machine gun just outside my dugout. Spitting away like furry & it fairly gets on ones nerves. Crack crack every minute of the day.

I was up at a machine gun position yesterday & it was trained on two cross roads about 3000 yards away, along which the Germans have to bring their supplies etc to the trenches further back the Ridge. You talk about cunning. The gunner would give a burst & then shut off for a half hour this period of quietness would give the Germans heart & they thought that the gun had moved to another position, when just as they would be crossing with vehicles & columns of men, away she would spit again & of course cause a lot of destruction & confusion
