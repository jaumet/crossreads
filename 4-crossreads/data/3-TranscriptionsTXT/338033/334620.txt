Lying around. Right opposite is the church where the Smith daughter used to sing. He and his family are supposed to be buried in the grave yard here.We went in and had a good look at the church coming out to have afternoon tea in a small building adjoining the church.Here we were served by kind ladies, with tea, cakes and scones and on asking the price were told it was a free buffet. We came back by Durington attending service at the Methodist church there.
The following Sunday I took a walk to Maddington
