  
 The spanish coast looks like the South coast of new South Wales but the villages are white instead of Black.  The Rock itself [sketch outline of the Rock with locations marked] Water sheds, Paths, cottages, village or town, Harbor inner, coal stage, Main Harbor, Mainly landlocked One side of the rock looks like an old Ivory Brooch, the other side rises sheer? There are plenty of war craft about including a Submarine.  There was a rumour on Board yesterday about a naval engagement in the North Sea.  There is only a strip of sand connecting Gibraltar with the Spanish coast, Somewhat similar to Nobbys at Newcastle.  The Rock itself looks very pretty from the inner harbor side.  There was some gun practice going on & the echoes were very perfect.  It took the sound a long time to travel to us nearly 1/2 a minute for about a mile.  When you are close to the Rock, it looks exactly like a picture because it rises so rapidly & ends so abruptly that the houses & trees look as if they were painted on it.  It is like a slice of cake in fact. 
 Wednesday 7-6-16 Left Gibraltar at 7.30 A.M.  The men scrambled money to the Coal lumpers yesterday evening & it was one of the funniest shows I have ever
