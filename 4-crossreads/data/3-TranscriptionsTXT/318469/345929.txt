been accustomed to look at in the North as we used to look at the dear old Cross in the South.  While this was happening a Field Gun was hurling shells close over our head into the Turkish lines in amongst the very people who have done so much against Christianity which St. Paul did so much to establish.
14thA fairly quiet day although there was a fair amount of Artillery fire from both sides.

18thLight Artillery & rifle fire on both sides nothing fresh.
19thSame as yesterday.

21stLittle artillery & rifle fire during day.  About 10.30 p.m. we opened with heavy rifle fire & bombs all along the line to which the Turks vigorously replied.  Our fire had been to find out their relative strength at different points along the firing line and it worked well.
