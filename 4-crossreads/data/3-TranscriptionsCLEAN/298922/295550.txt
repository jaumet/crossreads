  
 Tuesday 28 August 1917 
 Musketry on the Range:-  wherever a Standing Camp is made TARGETS are put up to keep the mens' "eyes in" & to exercise the new drafts of Reinforcements - which come along from the BASE. Some are Bushmen & some are  not . 
 40 c/s of Comforts from the Aust. Comforts Fund for the Regiment arrived last night. Tinned Fruit Juice, Pickles etc. & some excellent Khaki Shirts for the men. Not the least valuable were the cases for Firewood, which is always a very scarce commodity in this part of the Front. In FRANCE no doubt they have plenty.
