Dearest Mother & Father,I was glad to hear that you are all well. It is getting close up to Xmas. I am sorry to say that I will not be able to spend Christmas Day with Auntie. I have to stay here & look after the Christmas Dinner & New Year Dinner. We will have a good time I am getting poultry fruit nuts etc. There will be plenty of wine on the table. So I will not have too bad a time.My word it has been foggy lately. Isn't it rotten & so cold. Today has been a glorious N.S.W day, beautiful sunshine, only there is plenty of snow on the ground still. I am still unfit for active service. i think the square heads will turn it up before six months. They can't stand the boys coming at them in the winter.Remember me to all my friends, as I am kept busy & cannot get much time for writingHoping you are all well best wishes love & kissesYour loving SonTom
