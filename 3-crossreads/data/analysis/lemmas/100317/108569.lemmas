 As we continu along to the right we had to duck along veri fast . A shell whistl veri close was onli a precursor to anoth that land right over our head blind us with flash and deafen us for the moment . Sat down to get a breather and then locat old Keith Anderson and had a talk with him . He was dug in slight close against a chalk bank . Fritz snipe us a bit as we hop into the . All the way back we found that we were in heavili straf ground . On it floor were mani piec of metal and now and then was a whole shell case . Did not get back to Bn H.Q . until near 6.30 pm be veri tire and sweati . Near our Bn HQ a man was laid out . Lift the blanket I found he was a young chap of the 21st Bn
