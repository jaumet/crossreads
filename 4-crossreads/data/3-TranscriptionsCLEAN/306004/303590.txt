Cox & Gen Kater [Chaytor].   horses are led out daily & allowed to pick grass & there is fairly good horse feed here in tufts; at 8 oclock tonight a party of twelve men on Camels were seen approaching an Outpost at A Sqdn & when halted they turned & made off S.W. the sentry fired on the, & killed one Camel   they were pursued by Mr Moores Troop but they did not catch them, they were Bedouins & apparently came in to Willigha after dates, only a few late dates are obtainable now; I sent Edwards (Sig) out to Geisi today & am teaching 6 more men for 'phone work.
