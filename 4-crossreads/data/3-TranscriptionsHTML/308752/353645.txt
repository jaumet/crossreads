<p>of Tosca is said to be the best soprano in the World. The acting was very good &amp; the staging &amp; effects were magnificent. The theatre was packed &amp; there was a fair sprinkling of Australians amongst the audience. After the performance we visited a number of cafes, &amp; returned to our hotel about mid-night. The day had been an interesting one, as we had seen all the most important sights in the city so decided to visit the famous &amp; historic city of Antwerp the following day.</p>
<p>7 a.m. found us at the Gare du Nord (North Station) and at 7.15 a.m. we boarded the train for Antwerp. It is worth while mentioning, that a small sandwich was procured on the station, the price was 1 franc 7 &frac12;, equal to 1/5 1/2.    This will give you an idea of the price of food over here. The distance from Brussels to Antwerp is 27 &frac12; miles, but, the journey took 2 hours 45 minutes.  Rather quick travelling.  About halfway we passed through the town of Malines.  It was a busy place, full of factories &amp; railway workshops. It has a population of 50000 inhabitants. The country we travelled through from here was looking very fine, considering the Wintry conditions. At 10 a.m. we arrived at the Gare Centrale (Central Station) Antwerp. The station was a massive piece of construction &amp; much bigger than the Central Station Sydney.</p>
