Sun. 14th Apl. (cont.)At Cassel (10 a.m.) a most pleasant surprise awaited us.  My old acquaintance the waiter (still clad in evening dress which did not appear quite immaculate at such an hour as 10. a.m.) ushered us into the 1st class Damenzimmer & fed us on veal, unlimited potatoes & sauerkraut, cakes & coffee.   The cake was apparently made from sawdust but we were not in a critical mood.
By the way, lest it should appear that the Huns were treating we prisoners very well in the matter of meals I must explain that everything we ate we paid for ourselves.   Not a morsel is allowed us gratis & we are heavily billed for everything.   I breakfasted in state at the Brass Hats' table.   (which seated 8.)   Our parade back to the train was being awaited by Hunnish hundreds.   Revue stars are not in it with war-prisoners.
