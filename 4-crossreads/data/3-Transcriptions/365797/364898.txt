<p>Home<br/>Lindfield.<br/>Sydney.<br/>16.5.15.</p>
<p>My dear old Alan,<br/>Your letter on Tuesday has made us all feel both sad &amp; glad; sad that you have been ill &amp; disappointed, but glad as each day brings news of the great losses at the Dardanelles that you were not there. The paper accounts have made us feel proud of our own soldiers &amp; officers in this their first real fighting. Father is sending you cuttings.</p>
<p>I am hoping you have had our letters by this time, and oh! how we wish we were near to see to some things for you.</p>
<p>Dene went off to Camp today, and is to be in the A.M.C. with Jim Beattie. I think I told you that Uncle Jim is going on the 20th. as Major in the 19th &amp; Cairns is his Lieutenant. He had a lovely (Zeiss) pair of field glasses given him by Mr. Henderson who was selector so long with him in the Ruby Union, &amp; the Union Committee gave him a lovely pipe &amp; pouch with his monogram in gold. Some girls gave him a chamois vest, Aunt Soph gave him a lovely rubber carry-all fitted out with shaving &amp; bath</p>
