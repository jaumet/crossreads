<p>[Extract from the Melbourne Argus of 21 January, 1916]<br/>Visiting Troops</p>
<p>Soldiers from New South Wales were on leave in Melbourne at the time of the recent street disturbances, &amp; it was hinted in some quarters that they were involved in the trouble. This was due to a misapprehension. The officers of the Victorian Headquarters Staff have expressed their appreciation, declaring that the behaviour of the troops during their short stay in Melbourne was exemplary.</p>
