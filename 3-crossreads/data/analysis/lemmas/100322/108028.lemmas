 18/4/19 Marcinell peopl are about their hous . They scrub the outsid front wall and lintel daili with soap and water and the scrub of the flag is an event of two or three time a day . Their care in this respect is a mark contrast to their filthi lack of sanit and their dislik to wash their bodi . On the canal this warm pleasant even are mani barg and the watermen and their wive sit yarn . Got away from Charleroi station at about 9 pm on a pack train . The journey all night was one of the most wretch I ever rememb . Had to sit on my suitcas crouch up against the heater of a wagon lit . All night had no sleep ? there were women ( some elder ) crouch in the corridor .
