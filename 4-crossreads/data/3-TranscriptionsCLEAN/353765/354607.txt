June 1916[Note in margin:] Friday9th - News re K's death confirmed by papers. Also state that Genl Sir W.R. Robertson takes his place. Hearsay only. The question here now is "Are we going to France" or not? I am inclined to think we will be there before long, but indications point both ways, understand N.Z.M.R. kit bags have been sent to England & the L.H. kit bags are at Port Said. Heard that the Col. trying to get ours here. Don't want mine. Too much of a nuisance. 7th L.H. seem to be building stables. They had their felt hats withdrawn & helmets issued again. 5th L H'men said that a lot of English infantry now at Qatia. Another batch of paratyphoid inoculations put through.
