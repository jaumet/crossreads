<p>23 May 1915<br/>Whit Sunday</p>
<p>Our turn at trench sapping<br/>Work the four platoons in 4 reliefs during the day.<br/>This blooming navvy work was something we never bargained for but it is as necessary as eating   &amp;  nobody ever complains</p>
<p>1915 May 24<br/>Monday<br/>Whitsun Monday, Bank Holiday</p>
<p>We are awakened early in the morning   &amp;  told to get our breakfast as we would be burying the dead all day.<br/>A successful Armistice having been arranged from 8 am to 4 pm.<br/>The job is absolutely awful. The corpses having been exposed to sun   &amp;  rain for nearly a month   &amp;  when we attempted to move them they fell to pieces<br/>It was simply gastly searching them for papers.   &amp;  Identification discs<br/>We get an issue of rum when the job is done.<br/>R.I.P.</p>
