Military Camp at Holdsworthy.C Company, 9th Battalion.3rd. November 1915.
Dear Douglas/.As you will see by the heading I am now in Camp at Holdsworthy. I suppose mother has already given you particulars of my enlistment and failure to get into the A.A.M.C.We are very well looked after here - plenty of food but not much variety. On arrival at the Camp all the new recruits are greeted with cries of  "Marmalades" and "You'll miss you Mummy" and similar witicisms. This led us to expect that our chief jam would be Marmalade but we found on the contrary that we got very few tins of marmalade.Our tent is named "the Keystone" that name having been painted on the front by some former occupants, and it is very appropriate to the present inmates. Despite my ambition to be a second Charles Chaplin I must admit that I am outdone by the members of the Keystone Company. They are always having furious wordy warfares over trifles and some of them are a treat to listen to. They all come from Ashfield and knew one another well before enlisting. They are not a very pugnacious crew, despite their rowdiness, and no matter how much they quarrel amongst themselves, they leave Stirling and me and all our belongings strictly alone.We all retire to our bunks early and while Stirling and I doze off to sleep the others play cards or "argufy".
