<p>50<br/>a Mission Tent at Perham Downs was introduced there by my old friend Horace Horsewell. I spent very many happy evenings there and one evening was given an opportunity of testifying for the Lord. Revd A Cook, a Baptist Minister presided whilst I was there and one night he spoke from a paper on the life of Gen Gordon, the hero of the Sudan.</p>
