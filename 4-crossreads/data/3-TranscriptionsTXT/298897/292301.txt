Passed the island of Pantellaria about 10 P.M. close enough to see lights.  Having a splendid trip plenty of fun & frolic & then after dark we congregate in the mess & yarn & smoke over a glass of beer.  The mess is in what in ordinary times is the 1st class smoke room which is panelled off in oak in old fashioned style.  No electric light being allowed we manage with a few hurricane lamps & candles, blankets being hung over the ports.  The result is a scene which conjures up scenes of olden days, of men gathering in the village inn for gossip & smoking & yarning or listening to the scratching of a fiddle.
Monday 26thJuneDay opened up cool & misty.  Passed what we believe to be the South of Sardinia about midday still being escorted by our T.B.D number 69.  Sports & boxing during the afternoon, the boxing being of the willing variety.  Cool change at night but slept on
