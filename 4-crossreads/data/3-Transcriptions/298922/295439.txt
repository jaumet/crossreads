<p>Monday 23 April 1917</p>
<p>Move out to support again. This is a new line of Trenches. Casualities have been heavy. I hope Nowell Forth is alright. I believe he came out just before this fight began.</p>
<p>Bombed again today &amp; more horses &amp; men Killed. I must say I do not like bombs.</p>
<p>Our horses are SHIN SORE coming on to the hard ground after the Desert Sand. There are no trees in this part except <strike>on ground</strike> Orchards of Almond, Peach, Apricot, Vines Figs Pomegranates etc., not in season yet &ndash; tho' 1000s of acres of Barley &amp; Wheat are nearly ready for the stripper. NO FENCES in this country.</p>
