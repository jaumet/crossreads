<p>Friday 29th June 1917:-</p>
<p>For the past three days have been finding plenty of work to keep me going. My predecessor let things slide a bit and I have been bust bringing them up to scratch. The weather has been very changeable. It is sometimes hot &amp; sunny, then cold &amp; cloudy with a downpour of rain now &amp; again.</p>

<p>Last night had a visit from a couple of chaps who used to belong to No 2 A.G.H. &amp; transferred to A.Y.C. Detail, 5th Inf Battalion. We were talking over old times for quite a long time.</p>
