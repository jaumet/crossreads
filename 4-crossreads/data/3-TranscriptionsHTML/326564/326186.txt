<p>falling but things are very muddy but this did not stop us from going on the usual route march, &amp; for a change we had the band with us they marched us for a good hour then about turned &amp; back to Camp without a spell, pretty rotten I reckon, but they have treated us very shabbily here, &amp;  Capt Somerset is the cause of it all, he is too regimental for us, &amp; is thoroughly disliked by the Coy, I wish we could get rid of him, for he is making things very unpleasant for the lads &amp; I might say for all of us<br/>Today we got orders that we were moving tomorrow for the Somme &amp; that we were hopping in for our cut at the earliest opportunity &amp; so there will be a few of the lads missing in a week or so worse luck</p>
