<p>digging. It was the only one up on either side all day, ours don't seem to be about when Fritz appears, but it was a dull misty day. When we went over to company headquarters to join the usual carrying parties, some sad news was heard. His shells have been falling thereabouts all the time, &amp; Captain Wallach who came up from the cellar he was in to have his tea was killed in the room by a shell. Not only that, but D Coy. hasn't an officer left, as Lieutenants Smith, Watson &amp; Jones have all been wounded by shells. Lt. Lilley, in charge of our platoon, was evacuated last night sick luckily, or he might have gone with Capt. Wallach. It's an awful business; he was one of the best, only a very young chap but tall &amp; wiry, &amp; liked by all his company, rose from the ranks too I think, &amp; won the Military Cross. Our section was there first, &amp; as it was too light at &frac14;  to 8 to go for rations, the company sergeant major told us to wait below in the cellar, as shells were dropping occasionally. We talked to some signallers there, &amp; were jolly glad when a chap came in later &amp; said the rations were all up. Had some hot stew &amp; tea, went back to our trench till the 3a.m. trip is due with tea &amp; next day's dry rations of bully, bread &amp; jam. I was on gas guard from 11 till 12, &amp; the cursed shells</p>
