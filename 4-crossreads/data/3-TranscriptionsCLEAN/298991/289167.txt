Sunday May 13thWent with Uncle & Tal to the Baptist church here, I did not think much of the sermon as the parson just spoke of the ways & doings of the missionary in Congo, it wasn't at all interesting. Went for a walk to Victoria Gardens with Tal, I quite enjoyed it very much. Didn't go out tonight, we had a visitor, & sang some hymns.
Monday May 14thVery smoky & Hazy day this morning but gradually got clear about noon. A lovely evening. Mr & Mrs & Tal Robinson & I went to the Natural Museum at South Kensington this afternoon. A most enjoyable time was spent. The museum is a fine large building of some wonderful artistic work adorning it. The most particular place of note was closed today, that was the whale house, I regret very much not seeing it. The next place of interest was birds & their habits in their natural state. We later visited where very old structures, cupboards, chariots, carvings etc were exhibited. I was very tired upon arrival home. Went round to the London Fire Brigade, where we saw Mr & Mrs G. Swaine. (nee Miss Robinson).
Tuesday May 15thStopped a home all day. Very muggy day. Went to Coleseum Theatre in the night, It was variety, & every turn was very good, we (Tal & I) both had quite an enjoyable time. It was about midnight when we arrived home. There is a "Bus" strike on here. The streets seems to be very quite without them, one thing a fellow hasn't to much trouble & dodging getting across the heavily trafficked streets. Strike caused through grievence with Government.
