 Left off work at 1 o'clock &amp; went to Kosturgan beyond Dragomanci for sports by 706 &amp; 708 Co. M.T.A.S.C. S.W.H. (13) were captured by the sergeants for dinner &ndash; given a great spread. Left for home at 11.30 bringing 4 Sergeants with us. Got home at 5 a.m. Sergeants considered it great triumph to have us. Hid 2 bottles of whisky under my chair. Plenty champagne.
