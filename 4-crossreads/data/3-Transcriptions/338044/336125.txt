<p><u>1915</u><br/>1st December   <strike>30th Nov</strike> :-<br/>A cold day &amp;  raining slightly for the first time since we are in Egypt. However the rain soon goes away &amp;  I proceed to the Base with my orders to report for duty. First day in office is rather irksome after the outdoor life &amp;  comparative freedom of the camp. Our quarters are in Opera Square, Cairo, where we are supplied with wicker beds (of the native pattern)    &amp; the meals are very much to be appreciated, but not nearly so good as home. Native waiters of course, Arabs ("Niggers") &amp;  they have a bad time, mixture of Arabic &amp; French &amp;  English being hurled at them from all quarters. Mosquitoes are awful &amp;  therefore my first nights is greatly disturbed. Having no net</p>
