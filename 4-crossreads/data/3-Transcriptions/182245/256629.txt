<p>24 TUESDAY</p>
<p>A perfect day. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness ect all afternoon</p>
<p>&amp; took our horses out</p>
<p>for exercise &amp; grazing</p>
<p>in morning. Some of the</p>
<p>sergeants rode into</p>
<p>Bolougne, but lower ranks</p>
<p>are not allowed to go.</p>
<p>I got letters from Linda</p>
<p>father &amp; M<sup>rs</sup>&nbsp;Allison but</p>
<p>none from mother.</p>
