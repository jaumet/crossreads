We left Perth about 6. o'clock, and were soon at Fremantle once again. The night was very dismal, a light drizzling rain setting in.
The next day, the 30th October 1916, was particularly fine. Some 750 troops embarked on our transport (Western Australians)
At 5. o'clock, we left Fremantle amidst great enthusiasm. In an hour's time, we had seen the last of the shores of Australia for some time. In a day or two, we settled down to make ourselves, as comfortable as possible. We were fairly crowded though!
All sorts of amusement was indulged in, "Crown and anchor", race games of all descriptions, "two up"!, and who can call to mind the rest! Light drill and exercises were carried out
