3 - I long for news of you.I have not had letters from the girls or Gibson for a long time.I enclose a funny snapshot of some sisters & me coming on duty - taken by a patient. I don't know why I'm looking so stiff I didn't know I was snapshotted till I saw the print. The nights are still very cool - but the sun is very hot - crossing the drill ground from our home to the hospital. I live Constance's letters you enclose - give her my dearest love. What a happy peaceful life she has - but full of romantic sorrows - such as the story of David's tooth. Oh Mum I long for you to talk to and I can hear you say - "now go to bed my poor little girl and don't think about it any more." The way you used to when I was full of all that had happened during a busy week at P.A. I hope Father is well. You cannot know how I long to see you all again - and yet if Father & you keep well and strong I feel I am of use here as long as I am strong.
