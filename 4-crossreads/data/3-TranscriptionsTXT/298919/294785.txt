sending out particulars when another steamer Zealandic sent out SOS at 4.45pm giving her position 20 minutes of Long. also being chased by sub.  Their relative positions were 20 & 40 miles from us.  The Zealandic is fitted with guns, and she is supposed to have fired a shot at the sub, but do not know how it got on.  At 6.5 pm two destroyers were working.  One evidently containing the commodore, signalled the other City of Edinburgh being chased by submarine, steering Q[?] Westard.  Get into direct touch if possible.  I expect you to save the ship".  At 6.15 HMS "Melpomene", signalled to the City of Edinburgh "Two destroyers in your immediate vicinity, speak them direct by wireless".  These two ships reported that they had lost sight of sub at 5.40pm.  At 6.35 I could hardly believe my ears when for the 3rd time in 2&#189; hours I heard SOS.
