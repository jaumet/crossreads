 August, 1915 Monday 2  We are more settled today but the ship is very dirty &amp; we have 200 more men than room for.  We change into destroyers &amp; mine sweepers tomorrow night &ndash; Just washed a shirt so as to be clean. What men want training in in Australia is Rapid fire Musketry &amp; Trench work. I was sorry to leave my horses but glad to get away from the Desert &amp; into the firing line.
