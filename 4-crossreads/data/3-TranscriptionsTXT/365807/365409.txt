 Dear Mother, 
 What little news there was to tell has all been used up on Dorothy, but I have made a most remarkable discovery. One of my doctors &ndash; I appear to have three of them &ndash; who goes by the name of Capt. Nicolls (its certain not to be spelt that way, but it's the way to pronounce it) is a most remarkable man. I think I told you of his nasty habit of sticking pins into one, a practice which he carries out with such efficiency &amp; finesse that one would think his whole life had been given over to a study of this art alone. But you would be wrong for he is an author between whiles, &amp; hides his identity under the nom de plume Martin Something Swayne. He wrote 'Lord Richard in the pantry', 'The Bishop &amp; the Lady' &amp; many other delightful books. 
 I enclose a clipping from The Times
