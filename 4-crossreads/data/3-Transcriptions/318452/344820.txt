<p>Father Le Maitre an R C Chaplain<br/>Early on the morning of the 31st we put out into the stream and there we lay for 3 days and this morning at 12 we left.<br/>I have met quite a lot of lads I know among them Bob Nelson &amp; T. Roberts, Lt Jon Tarn &amp; Brian Cavanagh The OC is Col Fewtrell<br/>The weather was too bad to permit of an official parade at 10 so I went to C Troop deck &amp; had a very nice little service.<br/>There are 10 boats in the Convoy &amp; an escort of Destroyers &amp; a Cruiser Maria. So we are rather a formidable convoy. The sea is nice &amp; calm but we are only steaming slowly<br/>I have a service at 6. Rough on the troop deck</p>
