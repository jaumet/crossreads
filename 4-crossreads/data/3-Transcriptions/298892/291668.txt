<p>2nd. February '17.</p>
<p>Dear Mother/.<br/>We are having a spell in billets again now so I have at length an opportunity of writing you a long letter in answer to your last two.<br/>I sent a couple of active service Post cards as I was unable to write the last two weeks to let you know I was well. I was more than pleased to receive a photo of you although as you say you don't look quite yourself. I am looking forward to receiving more of the family and a more faithful likeness of yourself. Douglas's photo was missing from your letter although you mentioned sending it. Yours is indeed a great libel on</p>
