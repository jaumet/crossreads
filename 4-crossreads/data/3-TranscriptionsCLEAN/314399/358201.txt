Thursday 24 July 1919Got the 10.20 to town & met Janet at Victoria at 1.40. We then had lunch & went by train to Clapham Common & by bus from there to Leatherhead. We had tea there & walked about a lot & then got a train to London Bridge. Janet got her train from there at 9.10 to Brighton. I then went & saw Marie & had supper at the flat.
