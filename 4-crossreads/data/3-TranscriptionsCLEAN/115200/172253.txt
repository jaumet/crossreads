It is just 12 months ago today Since we left Dear old Australia and many things have happened in that time  Since then we made our famous landing at Gallipoli and Some of my Best mates have Been Killed. When we were Embarking at Port Melbourne Some of those that were Killed were all Smiles  But they now rest in a lonely grave [on?] Gallipoli
