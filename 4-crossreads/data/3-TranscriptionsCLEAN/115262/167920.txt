Saturday 2 June 1917.
"Still at sea" & air very foul in No 3 & No 4 deck. Paraded with bad cold & was given "no duty". (1st time since entering camp that I've had to parade sick). Japanese Cruiser signalling "short of coal"
We are now 1 day behind time & at 6 pm have 155 tons of coal left in bunkers to get to Colombo - now 250 miles away.
Stayed above deck & read & yarned. Went aft at 6 pm & watched "log".
Air slightly improved & cold feeling a shade better.
Speed 8 to 10 knots per hr.
