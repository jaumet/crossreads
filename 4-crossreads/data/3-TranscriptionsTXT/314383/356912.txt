After a lot of delay we managed to get our point in, i.e. we wanted a few guides to show my officers to the various villages among the hills.  We spent about 4 hours then had tea, fruit juice drinks of sherbert &amp; and Mais  (sour milk). 
 The part one has to maintain in these visits is ridiculous. For instance, Guide ahead with two officers in rear &amp; 4 Sgts behind them, &amp; even tho'  it is not a &frac14; of a mile, one must ride. The Sgts are bricks &amp; carried out their part of the farce excellently.  They jump about as if the fear of God is in their hearts at the least look from &amp; never give the show away.
