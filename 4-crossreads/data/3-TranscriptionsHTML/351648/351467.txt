<p>The famous 6th is nearly all split up &amp; a tremendous lot of them have now got commissions in other branches mostly in the Infantry.  I heard delightful stories of them all, Alison, Sandy Jacques, young Hardy, Street, Reynolds, Lamrock, McKeown, Hasty A'beckett, Macaush, all of whom I knew &amp; very many others.  Weary &amp; Sandy were the wits of the party &amp; kept them continually amused, Weary in particular, he grew as you know a huge red beard, wore a blue singlet &amp; very abreviated shorts &amp; they called him Jesus Christ from his resemblance to <strike>the</strike> his pictures. <strike>of that</strike>  One night at Lone Pine when he was on guard duty when rations were particularly short <strike>the Adjutant</strike> &amp; Weary who was always hungry was particularly so the Adjutant was doing night rounds &amp; when he got to Alison was pulled up there.  Halt!  Who goes there?</p>
<p>Friend!</p>
<p>Advance friend &amp; give the Counter Lunch!</p>
<p>The Adjutant who had to reprove him did so very leniently &amp; was finally overcome by the humor of it all, the stories are numberless of them all.</p>
<p>It is my very great regret that I did not get over in time to get to the Peninsular, in future years in Australia it is going to be a hall mark, &amp; even now there is a feeling of comradeship amongst those who were there at any time, no matter if only for 36 hours, that is very noticeable &amp; which will in future become more marked, I feel quite an intruder &amp; outsider amongst them all.</p>
