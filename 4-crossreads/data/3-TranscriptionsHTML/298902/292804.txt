Returning to the Station I decided to stop the night &amp; catch the 9.30 A.M. train next day from the Turlinfin [?] Siding.  Had a good meal at 6 P.M. and was unfortunate in my bed, it being very second rate.  However I slept well, turning in about 10 P.M.  Raining most of day which did not make the return any more cheerful.</p>
<p>Friday 13th Dec.  Up at 7 &amp; went to station to collect my things then had breakfast after which, set off to the Siding, about 3 miles away but received a lift for most of the distance.  Had to pay for the bed &amp; breakfast of my companion, a stranger, but didn't squeak as 'twas my own fault.  The train, composed of trucks, several of which had seats &amp; fireplace provided, left about 10 A.M. &amp; we travelled very slowly but otherwise fairly comfortably.  Had difficulty over meals as I had nothing with me</p>
