Saturday 4/9/14In the morning we go a good distance into the harbor of Langini (Simalu) so as not to be seen from outside. We are coaling up till 10 p.m.
Sunday 5/9/14At 6 o'clock coaling continued. A Kanaka tells us that when they were in Ceylon 2 warships were laying there. They were alternately going out and often brought back a steamer. One day they went out together and only one returned - with one funnel. We presume that they had been in action with "Konigsberg." Among other things we heard that "Konigsberg" had already captured about 10 steamers. Whilst "Emden" was coaling a Dutch Government steamer from Sinabban entered the harbour and anchored near by. A Dutch official, representing the Dutch government requested that "Emden" and "Markomania" must, as soon as possible, leave the harbour as this was no place for coaling and
