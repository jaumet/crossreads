<p>Wednesday 10 May 1916<br/>A beautifully bright clear day, the camp consequently being a busy scene with men drying clothes &amp;c. Up at reveille &amp; going hard during the day fixing up company matters with the exception of &frac34; of an hour taken up at the dentist's. A block in the railway traffic occurred in the early morning &amp; it was very astonishing to see how the trains backed up.</p>
