<p>Tuesday Sept 25th<br/>"J" boat roll was called this morning, &amp; as I expected, I am on it. There are about 800 on it, out of this camp. The next boat roll is expected to clear the camp out. Went through medical inspection this morning, &amp; kit inspection this afternoon. I had to hand back a pair of boots, a tunic, jack knife, &amp; knife, folk &amp; spoon. Everyone seems to be very pleased to be on the roll. A Bournemouth party gave a concert in the gym this evening, they weren't too bad.</p>
<p>Wednesday Sept 26th<br/> "L" boat roll left early this morning to embark. We are expecting to leave tomorrow morning. Very dull &amp; wet day. A party from the Pavillion Theatre, Weymouth gave a concert in the Gym this afternoon, they were very rough.<br/>Received orders tonight, reveille 3.30 am tomorrow morning, breakfast 4 am, so we will have to be up pretty early.</p>
