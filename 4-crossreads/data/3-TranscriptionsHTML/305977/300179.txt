<p>night at this camp.  Peter Gosling was one.  Went over to find him but he was away looking up some of the 7th.</p>
<p>Sunday 21st<br/>Full Protestant Church Parade in the morning.  Had leave after dinner &amp; caught the 11.35 train from Maadi with several of D troop lads, including Walsh from Dorrigo.  Went out to Mena &amp; got Ted Rabbitts.  We all went into the Pyramid &amp; had a look into the Kings Chamber.  It is very hot inside &amp; the passages are very narrow.  The construction is a marvellous bit of work especially the ceiling of the Kings chamber.  Also had a look at the Sphinx.  Had tea out there.  Came back in the tram &amp; went to the Pathes pictures.  They were very good, but we miss a lot not being able to understand the French explanations.  Got back at 11.15.</p>
