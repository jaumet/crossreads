<p>they knew I was ill.  If I happened to be asleep when any work came along for which I was supposed to be due, they would get someone else in my place, &amp; not wake me up.  One night, I woke up suddenly &amp; found myself alone in the trench.  A horrible nightmare of an idea that the line had been abandoned &amp; the whole lot wiped out came to me; but then I remembered &amp; got out on the wire fatigue.</p>
<p>Another night I found Judkins had taken my place on post, though it was my turn; &amp; he didn't want me to take over from him.  On another occasion, after I had been having some shivering fits, George Abrams brought me along a dixie with rum in it, &amp; said the boys had all subscribed half a spoonful &ndash; a fine thing when the way in which rum is prized in the line is considered.</p>
<p>Of course, I did what I could for the boys: wrote letters for them, gave them advice, &amp; helped to get matters rectified for them in paybook mistakes etc; &amp; I used to tell them yarns; but I appreciated  their acts of consideration, especially when a lot of them turned out to give me a send off when I left in the ambulance.</p>
