<p>We had a route march through the town, it proved to be a typical dark man's habitation. We nearly roasted on our march!<br/>On either side of the roadway, an admiring crowd of these black people, wondered what the last shower had brought down.

We were now free for a few hours We made the best use of our time, visiting this queer type of town.
