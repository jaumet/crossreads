More Cavalry drill trotting about, & what we should do if we had lances etc. - the old saying "if you want to learn how not to make money out of the Land go to an Agricultural College".
[The following sentence crossed through.]Letter card from May & just heard of the evacuation of KUT by TURKS.
The S.S. "HUNTSEND" boat I came from England in has been torpedoed [indecipherable] in the Aegean Sea so I was lucky to arrive here safely - 2 LECTURES a day & much Military LAW, this is soldering!!!  We've only been fighting.
