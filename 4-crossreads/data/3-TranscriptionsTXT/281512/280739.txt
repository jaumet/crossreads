Colonel Shellshear called during the evening, & is going to spend the evening with us. Outside it is blowing a gale & pelting rain.

25th Octr./17Visitors are a confounded nuisance. Col Shellshear stayed the night & though perfectly welcome, delayed an early start. My results suffered, as the days are now short & today was of rare sunshine. I visited various waggon lines around Dickebush, also a concentration Camp where I met the 58th. Batallion. The 58th.
