SEPT.   SUNDAY 17   1916
Fine all day but came on to rain at night. Alan & self had dinner with Cam Williams & we went out to Hendon with him afterwards. I went up for a fly there & it was great. I was only up for a quarter of an hour & got up 800 odd ft & he did some spiral dives ect  It was great & I could do a lot more if I had time. Went back to the flat at 91 Jermyn St & there were about a dozen Australians there & we had a great time. Got the 7.20 from Waterloo to Salisbury & met Warren & we got a car home. I had a great week end.
