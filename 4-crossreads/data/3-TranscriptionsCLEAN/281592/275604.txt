 Jan 16th Sat.  Pay 10/- 
 Rain in the forenoon.  Went ashore in a small cutter. 
 Went through a part of the town which was made up of native shops and dwellings.  It was a picturesque scene to see these shops all open to the street.  Fruitshops, Grocers, Bootmakers, Drapers all with a peculiar air about them which I had not seen previosuly.  Every place was open to the public eye and one found it extremely interesting to watch the native blacksmith, cage makers, bootmakers and broom makers at work.  We wandered about with no particular aim in view till we reached Ras-el-Tin Palace.  In the Barracks some Manchester Territorials are stationed at present.  A few of them took us round the barracks and showed us the place.  We then made our way along the  water   sea front back to the city.  Had dinner in the Soldiers & Sailors Home.  Not very much life about that place. 
 We took a cab after the usual bargaining on prices.  The driver drove us to Pompeii Pillar and we saw Catacombs under it.
