<p>&amp; at night when the city was <strike>light</strike> lit up it looked very pretty with 50 or 60 boats lit <strike>light</strike> up as well. The high mountains which form the back ground of the city is called "Pedrotaliagalla" &amp;  is 8,280 ft. high.</p>
<p>Monday 16.11.14.  The Captain &amp;  some of the ships officers went ashore &amp;  brought back the papers with the latest war news. The Dr. read it out to us all which we were very pleased to hear.

<p>Tuesday 17.11.14.  This morning is very warm, last night was passed away by a boxing contest it was very amusing two fights ended in <strike>ko</strike> nock-outs, there was great excitement when Jimmy Gray of (H Coy) &amp; another chap entered the ring to have a 4 round spar. it was the wildest hitting I have seen for many a long day  Jimmy nocked up his hand in the first round &amp;  had to throw the towel in.  We left Colombo at 12 pm &amp;  were escorted out by a Russian &amp;  English Cruisers. they passed quite close to our boat.</p>
