  
 very nice; especially the preserved fruit, which the chaps nearly go mad over here. You ought to have a splendid spring at home after all the rain but you want more now I suppose to stop the wheat setting down too hard where it has been boggy. The Corriedales seem to be increasing well; there is no doubt they are the sheep and we are going to do great things with them - we will have to get all the land we can under cultivation as soon as I get back so as to make the lambs grow well - we will never have much trouble to sell the rams judging by the way people want them now. I thought you would soon have the road up to the house fixed once you got a car, the wool shed is too far away for a garage - I suppose you keep the sulky there now. I heard that Leycester's wound is alright again and he was expected back at the regt. So may go over and try to see him to night. Am afraid this letter is not very interresting but I do like talking about home and you would laugh if you could know all the schemes I work out in my head for getting rid of the rabbits and more wheat in when we get back.
