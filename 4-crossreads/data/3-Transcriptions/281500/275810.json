<p>6th Reveille at 6 0clock this morning for we were moving and consequently things are very busy especially for me, for the Sergeant of a platoon is responsible for everything and there is quite a lot to do, the first thing is to get the men out of bed and these cold mornings they naturally don't like stirring, after they are up I have to see that all blankets are rolled in bundles of 10 and that they are properly labelled and then carried round to the place where the transport picks them up, this has to be done by a certain time then the rations have to be drawn and I have to distribute them to the section commanders, who in turn dish it out to their men equally.<br/>After breakfast the billets have to be cleaned spick and span and all rubbish carried away to the</p>
