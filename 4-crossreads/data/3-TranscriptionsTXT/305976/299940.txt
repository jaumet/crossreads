moved on towards Railhead Half way along road we were told it was a short cut across country. We took it & arrived in Ramley about 3 pm. Our horses are showing themselves weary owing to the rough time they have had Ramley seems rather a large place & on first impression strikes one rather forcibly with its white buildings. Such a contrast to the hovels we have passed. It is connected by Railway and is surrounded by Orange Groves & Orchards.Friday Nov 23At last we have caught up with Division & moving out to Jaffa this afternoon.
