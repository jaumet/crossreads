<p>two perfectly sweet little girls, one about as old as Bill &amp; the other about two years old. They are the dearest little kids imaginable and are allowed to come into the drawing room and all. I was there for an hour yesterday for afternoon tea &amp; the old dame is perfectly sweet. She shakes hands with her two hands &amp; is most genuinely glad to see soldiers.</p>
<p>There is a great beach here and Im going down presently as its Sat. afternoon &amp; all the population goes there. The ladies have good complexions here and I haven't seen a dark one yet they are all blue eyes &amp; fair, so you see I'm quite safe, for they are sure to like dark boys. The Zulus are the most magnificent specimens of men I have ever seen, &amp; those who pull the rickshaws adorn themselves &amp; paint up wonderfully. The city is not a large one but it has one fine street, West Street.</p>
<p>I was not sick at all coming over &amp; we had one big storm too. I think the Karola broke me in. Well Mother dear give my love to all &amp; hoping grandma pulled through that awful pneumonia.</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
