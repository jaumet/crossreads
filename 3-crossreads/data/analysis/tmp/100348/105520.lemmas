 19/1/16 The " Oster " sail at 3.30 P.M. We pass Queenscliff and Pt Lonsdal about sunset and I was abl to get a good look at the old beach were we use to play when we were kiddi . I saw our old home quit plain , the sight of that littl old hous where I was born woke a lot of memoir . We drop the pilot onsid the " Rip " just as the sun went down , rather a thrill spectacl for there was rather a heavi swell on . 20/1/16 Mal-de-M has claim mani victim today . There is a heavi sea run . I have had no indic of sick as yet but I am thorough enjoy this trip .
