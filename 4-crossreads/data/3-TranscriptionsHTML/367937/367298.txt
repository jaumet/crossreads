<p>14th September 1916</p>
<p>My dear Hal and Fred<br/>Thank you for your letter of 10th July which only came yesterday, containing the eight photos of home.<br/>My word! I was glad to get them and see a little bit of home again but I dont think the paper you used was too good as all the photos had gone rather blurry. The one with Dick in the cart and also the one of the horses were good also the one of the house but it was very hard to make out the people in the car and the corriedale rams had nearly gone altogether &ndash; I could see Mother and Miss Sterling very plainly in the Reedy Creek one &ndash; anyhow I was jolly pleased to get them; and does not the car look grand: I almost imagined I was sailing along in it I sat looking at it so long.<br/>Am posting Mother some views of round here and one of some high class ladies in Cairo.<br/>They are good cards and show you the class of country we live in no 5 is our camp and the oscis one is a good one of the date palms. I had to pay 3 piastres each for them so they are worth keeping and I'll be able to tell you lots about them when we get back. I wrote to you only a couple of days ago. Love to Aunt Katie<br/>Your loving brother<br/>Robert C. Wilson</p>
