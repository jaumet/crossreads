22/6/18A windy dull and blustery day so I remained in bed all day in order to complete a recovery. Feeling better. Remarkably quiet and uneventful day.
23/6/18Remained in bed. There was an inspection and presentation of ribbons by General Monash at Bde.H.Q. and as some Bishop or other turned up there for lunch our Band went down and played for them. After lunch General Patton looked in and had a yarn about things generally. From the Staff nowadays we get nothing in the way of advice or criticism unless something goes wrong to a glaring extent. Usually they are content to pick C.O.s carefully and leave all to them. Keith Sutherland, Stewart Davis Matthews and others dropped in for a yarn. Sgt. Cop & R.Q.M.S. Hawkins got their [indecipherable]. Gorman continues busy on his monumental work history of the battalion.
