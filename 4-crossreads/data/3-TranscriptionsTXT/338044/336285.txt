 14 About 10 30 great scare &ndash; we stopped went astern booster round then ahead again about &frac12; hours shuffling. Garbled explanation apparently nearly a collision &ndash; two vessels got mixed up between or near our escort &amp; ourselves. Owing to us showing no lights then were coming directly on to us until evidently they spotted our escort or were signalled to by it. The larger vessel passed us on the starboard side at a distance of 50 yards &ndash; the other &amp; smaller vessel appears to have cleared off as soon as it spotted us
