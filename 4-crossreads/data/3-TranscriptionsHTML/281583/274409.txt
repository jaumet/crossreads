<p>of same. Our Division commenced to move out today &amp; we go on Wednesday. The "Tommie" relieving us have already arrived. It is a moral that we are going down to the Somme again, &amp; I suppose just in time to participate in the push for Baupaume. This is going to be a terrible fight for possession of this place &amp; one cannot tell how we will get on. But from what I can hear it is absolutely essential for its capture at an early date. It is hard lines to leave the camp we have prepared for the winter &amp; go &amp; live in the open. I reckon it will just about finish me. The Brigade comes out of the trenches today &amp;  after resting will move out to the concentration area.</p>
<p>I received a letter from [indecipherable] today &amp; they are still in England. None of us can understand why they keep them there so long, but I suppose they know what they are doing. In the meantime the other Australians in France &amp; Flanders still refer to them as the Division which has not yet declared war.</p>
<p>Aeroplanes are again very active &amp; we are all expecting the bombardment which is sure to follow, following on the changing of Brigades.</p>
<p>23.10.16 Monday</p>
<p>The weather is not so cold today as previously but it threatens rain, which is sure to come. We are getting ready to move &amp; it hurts to have to go &amp; sleep in the open &amp; on the ground in weather of this kind, It is very funny</p>
