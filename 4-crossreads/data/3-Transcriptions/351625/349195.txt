<p>spent several hours looking over the <strike>town</strike> city the <strike>the</strike> chief feature of this place was its cathedrals of which there were about 4 beauties, the river running through the place was great too.  I think it was the Seine.  All the time we were travelling we were living on the good old bully beef &amp; biscuits which we got pretty tired of.  The tucker with the Batt. is not too bad at all except that it is a bit light.  So far I have felt no effects from the chats</p>
