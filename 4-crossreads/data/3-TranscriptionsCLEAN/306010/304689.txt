  
 I think I was the only Australian in Paris during my short stay and was of course of great interest where ever I went - one lady wanted to take me for a Spaniard - I have been an Italian, New Zealander & Canadian and also as an American as well. I only saw one Italian officer & two Russians in Paris although there were plenty of Belgians who now seem to be all over France. On Friday 27th at midday - after reporting at the Brit. Mil. Police office, I took a  train  taxi to the Gare du Nord and left Paris at 12.35, going through Beauvais and Alancourt to Le Trefort on the coast and then through Abbeville, Noyelle, Etaples & Boulogne to Wimereux where I arrived at 9 p.m. after a most interesting & enjoyable six days on leave in
