<p>Egypt in the year of grace 1915.  Yet here we are.  Not only here, but our comrades at the present, lying wounded in any hospital from Alexandria to Cairo, and worse still many of them dead on the feild of battle, midst the hills and shrubs of the Gallipoli peninsula, as a result of a fight against the Turks &amp; Germans.   We here, anxiously, await the casualty list, for confirmation of the rumours as to who have been killed and who wounded.  One thing we know that gives us and you satisfaction, is the manner in which both officers and men proved themselves worthy of their forefathers, at the same time, honouring their Mothers.   Yet 'tis little satisfaction to the dead. For them we can be say God rest their souls and class them midst the illustrious.   Bravo do we say of them.  Bravo!!  Bravo!!!   Bravo!!!!!.   Good luck to them all the time &amp; every time.   The task set them is said by the experts to have been, one of the most difficult of military exploits.

Good night!!!!!.<br/>[A line of Xs and Os]</p>

Lists of British officers appear each morning but none relating to our own men.  Naturally we should like to know.  We are given no information this morning.   This is depressing.  In fact, the telegrams for several days now have been sorry reading, even though they are purposely made favourable for us, the convincing side of the sentences as to sincerety is entirely absent.  It is probable</p>
