For this purpose a force of five Divisions should ensure success, provided at least two of these Divisions are troops which can be absolutely depended upon without a preliminary trial, which has so often proved necessary with our new formations.  As far as I know, the landing can he covered and assisted most materially by the guns of the Fleet right across to the Straits. 
 This force May seem very large but it must be borne in mind that the exact numbers of the enemy are not accurately known in Thrace, and we must he prepared to meet any formations he might send against us from the north, in addition to those who are now in the Gallipoli Peninsula. These are, I believe, estimated to amount to anything from seventy thousand to one hundred thousand. Personally, I am inclined towards the lower figure, after the heavy losses he has suffered.
