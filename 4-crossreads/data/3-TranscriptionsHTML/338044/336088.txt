<p>8th Oct:- Most exciting day so far. A cry of "land in sight" at daylight  &amp;  everybody goes silly   We turned back during the night to put into Albany.  The coast got gradually clearer  &amp; we were running alongside until 2 pm when we put into Albany Harbour.  As usual each thought we would get ashore, but this was a bad disappointment. We got a good view of the town &ndash; stayed here four hours. Only one man was put ashore &ndash; Graham, double pneumonia &ndash; and the mumps  &amp; diptheria patients had to stay aboard   Yellow flag hoisted. As a tug put alongside, a newspaper man soon sold out. Cries of  "Who won the Derby"  &amp;  "How's the war"   Albany seems a very pretty little town &amp;  the folks there comfortable. But it is so isolated    &amp;  has a very poor harbour</p>
