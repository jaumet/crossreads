<p>April 1916<br/>But at 12 oclock on the 23rd we marched out of Salhia &amp; reached Kantara just after 7.  We heard there that a full regiment of Yeomanry had been surrounded &amp; captured also a general.  Large numbers of Turks are reported in the vicinity.  We only stayed at Kantara about 3 hours &amp; had a feed &amp; a wash.  We were about ready for bed then; but we weren't destined to get any sleep till 2 am  The night was cool  We passed large camps of hosps; ambulances going backwards &amp; forwards also strings of motor lorries with stores &amp; supplies.</p>
<p>After 3 hours sleep we were up again; fed &amp; watered our horses  The camp here 12 miles on the desert side of Kantara is a busy bustling scene of military activity.  We saw 8 aeroplanes going out all in one long string like a line of birds.  At 9.30 we left camp &amp; started for the rail head.  We had several halts &amp; the day was fairly warm &amp; the going heavy being mostly loose sand.  It was fairly late when</p>
