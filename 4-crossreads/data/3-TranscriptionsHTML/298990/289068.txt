<p>Delville Wood 9/11/16  The Taubes have had our airmen well and truly bluffed and have been running rings round them all day.  The night was bright moonlight but bitterly cold and inclined to be frosty.  Fritz did one stunt with his artillery but on neither side were the guns as active as last night.  Slept fairly well on an ambulance stretcher but the guns were disturbing.</p>
<p>10/11/16  Awakened by 3 or 4 23rd officers arriving absolutely "dead beat", and found that after being the front line (which even hardened veterans describe as a butcher's shop) for four days they are being sent back here for a rest.  Only handfuls of men arrived the others falling by the way, being evacuated sick etc. The poor devils were nearly out of their minds and some were rambling and could not speak coherently.  Feet were awful once boots were taken off it was impossible to put them on again on account of the swelling.  So those men who complained we walked right over to the Field Ambulance and handed them over to the doctors there.  One case was awful the swellings extended right up the thighs and it was said to be the worst case of trench feet seen so far.  The spectacle of that shining light of  Melbne University Mr R E Hain barrister &amp; solicitor sitting on a box scraping mud off trousers and boots with a bayonet giggling sillily all the while nearly insane with exhaustion would have been an eye opener to some people of the horrors of war.  Pasco and another lad though tired to death couldn't sleep for thinking of the things they had seen so we doped them heavily with fiery rum which is mostly methyl alcohol and burns the very gizzard out of one.  A fine day with warm sun and the Taubes are over once again with our "archies" potting at them.  The way our aeroplanes dodge them makes me think that they must have superior machines in speed and armament to their previous ones.</p>
