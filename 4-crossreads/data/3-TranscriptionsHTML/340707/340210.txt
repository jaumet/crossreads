<p>an opportune moment</p>
<p>In morning I visited Barrack but Shakleton is not there However by waiting for a car I make the acquaintance of Whelton an Irish [indecipherable] in Air Force &amp; he invites me out to lunch at Buc. The drive out there through the Bois di Boulogne then St Cloud &amp; Versailles is beautiful. These parks would be worth being a monarch for even if once in a while some one more unfortunate than the others lost his head.</p>
<p>I spend day at Buc &amp; then return in a ambulance waggon which travels at 40 miles an hour most of time to amazement of all French police but being military they do not interfere.</p>
<p>We go to Nord &amp; then in Champs Elysee have an accident in which a gendarme narrowly escapes being killed This delays us for some time &amp; we have to run him to a place where he can put his bicycle However we part the best of friends &amp; he will claim against John Bull &amp; some day will be paid perhaps.</p>
