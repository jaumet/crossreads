When the boys come home
We are proud of our boys, our brave boyswho for their country are fightingNot for the sake of conquest or gainbut for the wrongs that needed rightingFor the sake of the lands that lie ruined For the sake of the homeless & sadFor the sake of the loved ones in homelandThey have given up all they had We think of them there in the trenchesIn the cold the mud & the rainWith the fiery shells bursting round themWhile they fight with might & mainBut what keeps our brave boys so steadfastwith courage that never gives way?The Lord stands beside them to help themand he is their strength &  their stay
But where did they learn of this Savioursave from the lips of their motheror from some comrade who loved himwho spoke of Him one to anotherBut some had forgotten this SaviourTill danger, death & alarm(when the comrade fell dead beside him)made them fly to his sheltering arm
But what about you in the HomelandIs this Saviour precious to youDo you pray him to keep these dear lads& commit them to him anew.are you keeping your promises to themare you helping with all your mightTo comfort cheer & help themwho have bravely gone to the fight
When this terrible war is ended& the boys - the brave boys - come homecome back to loved ones - & motherah! what will they find when they comea world where all is against thema struggle for life to beginor their loved ones & dear mother awaiting to welcome them in.
