Collected more supplies from the M.D.S. today & sent some forward to the R.A.P.'s. The A.D.M.S. has made our camp his H.Q.'s & we expect a move owing to the advance.

Carb. which I had forgotten to order, I went down to the C.C.S. with patients about 8 P.M. & arrived back about 11.30. The night was cool & very dark but the ride was enjoyable, very little traffic on the road. Had a stroll round viewing some german ammunition dumps near, which were well concealed, a second dump
