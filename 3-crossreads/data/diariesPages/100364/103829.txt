with Mawson and Martin to make a selection of slides. AIso went to Doctor having an attack of Pyrrca , which has been giving me much annoyance. 
24th July 18.
All day with Ponting on his lecture. Ponting is quite a charming character, honorable and a man to be relied upon. I like him immensely. He is however, frightfully finnicky, with too much regard for trifles, which he is prone to magnify to the extent of worrying himself. His work I cannot speak too highly in praise of and I set him up as an ideal.
