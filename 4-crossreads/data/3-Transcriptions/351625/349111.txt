<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>It is a week today since we left Cape Town &amp; we have been making a quick voyage in good weather since.  In a few days we expect to reach our next port the name of which you had better try &amp; find out yourself.  We have been keeping very well since we left Cape Town where we stayed about a fortnight &amp; had a tip top time as my letters from there will tell.  One bit of hard luck, my mate Smith was put off the boat the day we left there with meningitis &amp; we have not heard whether he survived or not but think he will pull through as he was a very strong chap &amp; I believe they operated very successfully before they put him off.  We have had only one case since then &amp; he has pulled through.  I think the hot weather will kill it out.  I am working at a job in the orderly room which will take about 10 days.  I don't like the job as it means</p>
