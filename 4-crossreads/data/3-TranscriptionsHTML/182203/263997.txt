<p>how I do wish it was ended. Such fine men, made helpless for life &ndash; the saddest cases I think are those who have lost their eyesight &amp; there are such numbers.<br/>I do hope you will all like Sister Murray, she is very thin but an awfully jolly sort  &amp; most intelligent, most likely she will ring-up or get out to see you, she is sure to visit Agnes' friend. You have not sent me Ag nor Bessie's address.<br/>Must stop now. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. <br/>From                                                                                                                                                                                                            Yours lovingly                                                                                                                                                                                                      Edith   <br/>What size is Eddy's <u>head</u>?</p>
