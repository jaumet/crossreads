<p>Mon. Feb. 25<br/>It's about time some more mail arrived. Haven't had a Letter from France for ages. Am beginning to wonder what's wrong.</p>
<p>That delightful scrawl of B.E's is conspicuous by its absence of late, too. I wonder whether that money is going to arrive or has my Letter asking for it gone to the Bottom.</p>
<p>Purchased a Puggaree for my Hat.</p>
<p>Bob, Head Asher, threatened to chastise the Chef, for passing "out of place" remarks to the Housekeeper.</p>
<p>Tues. 26<br/>Glorious day. Quite Spring weather. Bill Beard's and my Busy day. After Tea went to Concert in Sutton Veny with "Snowy" the Billiard Marked. It wasn't up to much, but passed away a pleasant hour.</p>
<p>There are Gangs of men digging up all the spare Ground around the Camp, so there should be plenty of vegetables, shortly.</p>
<p>Old Fritz's U Boats are doing good as well as harm, as he is making people realise that they can grow many things that they always used to Buy.</p>
<p>Went to Picture Show with "Snowy" the Barman.</p>
