  
 Fritz let us alone. During the day a Bale of sheepskin clothing arrived & it was hard work to keep the chaps off them. It is very hard to manage the men under these conditions & when the spirit ration is brought to light things are much worse. 
 I received a few letters today which were like a straw to a drowning men & God alone knows how eagerly I read them, as it is a good while since I received any. This is the anniversary of my departure from Sydney & if you were to only see the ground & know the hardships that we are living under you would know that it is  not all beer & skittles. 
 All the time & despite the terrible nature of weather & ground conditions, our attacks are being pressed home. As no doubt your papers will tell you. Taking the year right throughout, & through all circumstance I never suffered as I am now. 
 19.11.16 Sunday 
 Another cold day but no snow There has been furious bombardments all round the salient & old Fritz continued to put them over at us. We have been busy running round chasing after lost trucks tonight & we are by no means in a pleasant mood.
