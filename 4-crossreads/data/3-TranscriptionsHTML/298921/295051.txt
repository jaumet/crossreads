<p>March, 1915<br/>Friday 19<br/>Saw a Desert Hare today, a whitish grey with Brown ears &amp; a little smaller than our English Hare &ndash;<br/>Dogs (pariah) come in from the Desert at night &amp; prowl around our Camp, picking the Refuse pits, all breeds &amp; shapes, &amp; ferocious from starving &ndash; On Reconnaissance today I rode over to what is known as Virgins Tree, the spot where Virgin Mary camped on old Heliopolis<br/><u>You</u> would enjoy going to see all these Historical places.</p>
