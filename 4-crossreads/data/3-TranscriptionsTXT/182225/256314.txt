 1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 14 &nbsp; JULY 
 A fairly warm day, but cloudy. M r &nbsp;Neylan gave us flag drill in morning &amp; we cleaned up our huts for an inspection in afternoon. Andy Fisher &amp; the Lord Mayor of London were coming out but they never turned up. We got our first mail in the evening and it was great to hear from home. I got letters from Linda &amp; Jo. It was the third letter from Linda, but they say that there are more to come shortly so I dare say the first &amp; second will be amongst them.
