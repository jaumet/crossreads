 2nd Dec 1914 Nothing to note 
 3rd Dec 1914 The rumour is about that the Italian firms here have been warned that, within a few days Italy will be forced to fight with Germany against England. Germany  has promised Italy, Savoy and Malta, Austria - the former Italian territory . We all hold the opinion that if Italy joins us, against the Allies, the war will soon be over. An interesting article by a pro German American appears in the "Straits-Times of 2/12/14. It will clearly be seen from this article that Germany will be on top in this war. The last few evenings we sit outside and play cards. Unfortunately I have been practically forced to learn to play "Staat" in spite of papa's prohibition. It is not so bad as we are not gambling.
