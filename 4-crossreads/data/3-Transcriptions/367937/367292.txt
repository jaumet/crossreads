<p>very nice; especially the preserved fruit, which the chaps nearly go mad over here.<br/>You ought to have a splendid spring at home after all the rain but you want more now I suppose to stop the wheat setting down too hard where it has been boggy.<br/>The Corriedales seem to be increasing well; there is no doubt they are the sheep and we are going to do great things with them &ndash; we will have to get all the land we can under cultivation as soon as I get back so as to make the lambs grow well &ndash; we will never have much trouble to sell the rams judging by the way people want them now.<br/>I thought you would soon have the road up to the house fixed once you got a car, the wool shed is too far away for a garage &ndash; I suppose you keep the sulky there now.<br/>I heard that Leycester's wound is alright again and he was expected back at the regt. So may go over and try to see him to night.<br/>Am afraid this letter is not very interresting but I do like talking about home and you would laugh if you could know all the schemes I work out in my head for getting rid of the rabbits and more wheat in when we get back.<br/>Love to Mother and kind regards to Miss Sterling &amp; Dick<br/>I am<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Robert C.
