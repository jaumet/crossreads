15/1/16number of old images and statues and plenty of that harem lattice work that is now becoming so scarce owing to the present generations laziness.
In the shop the most wonderful collection of goods in brass and copper gold silver ivory and ebony. Lamps (pendent) hundreds of years old of dull brass, vases, incense burners, bowls and a thousand other articles of brass ware. Cabinets inlaid with mother of pearl. McCaul bought one of ebony and ivory for 5 pounds and Curnow one of ivory and inclose wood for the same. Plenty of little prayer desks. I bought a small Koran stand inlaid with mother of pearl. Some tables inlaid worth hundreds of pounds and against one wall a throne and dais in light wood with a design in creepers worked in mother of pearl. Some carved ivory and beaten metal work from India, old muskets steel & chain armour and Saracens head pieces. Porcelain ware in great variety.
Went into work shop where turner was working a rough lathe with a bow the string which was reefed round the curve of the article in manufacture thus getting it to revolve. Crouching over his work he held the chisel between his two big toes using his feet like hands and as deftly. He gave me a small piece of ivory he had turned not a quarter of an inch in length & yet exquisitely moulded. Behind him sat a child not 7 mechanically
