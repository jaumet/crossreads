However the fire was not serious &amp; did no damage. 
 On the morning of the 4.11.14 our Company peraded as usual at 10 am. after we had gone through a little semefore signalling we were taken up to the nose of the boat on the top deck where a big canvas bath had been erected. So we all had a bath it was good sport only it was not hardly deep enough.
