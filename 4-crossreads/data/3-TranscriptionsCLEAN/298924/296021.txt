  
 Saturday 8 February 1919 Gen. Cox replies to my application to travel with my wife - "NO".  This officer "is required to look after his Squadron!!!", so that blows out that. Divisional sports again dismounted - a surfeit of demands for prize money from Officers who supply the windfall for all this sport. Am afraid poor old Day will find this hard to read but it is not laziness on my part - stationery too hard to get & to carry & I am so used to my Diary I "carry on".
