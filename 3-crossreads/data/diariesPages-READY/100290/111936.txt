Saturday
Dispensary in morning.
Tony out in charge of hospital tent. Heartburnings of Box Payne: two other aspirants. Victory for Liverpool. Busy all afternoon fixing up hospital. 5 patients admitted. 
This "soldiering game" is a queer thing. Everyone for himself. "Bunky pulls the strings, the puppets dance".
