<p>the staff of Sisters etc, staying there until Wednesday. Hard luck for us, not to be with them all, but perhaps our luck will be better. We are all very happy &amp; comfortable here and very glad we were sent here, so no doubt, our Unit will soon go with the crowd. Had a letter from Dorothy to-day &amp; she does not say anything about joining the 1st A.G.H. I've had my teeth fixed up, so feel very happy about my mouth, once more. Fred is camped near here again, he came in Saturday &amp; took me to dinner. We went to a very nice Restaurant called "The Belgian" and got back just before 10 p.m. Sunday-afternoon Fred &amp; two of his officers came in &amp; spent the afternoon. We had such a number of visitors, quite a crowded room. We really are a very <u>popular unit</u> , and the boys do so like to come &amp; have a little home life. I went on night-duty last night, so stayed</p>
