May 20th 17:  During the past few weeks there have been no events of great importance on this Front.  Our forces have been chiefly engaged in constructing two strong lines of defence, the main line being on the West side of the Wadi Ghuzze running from Gaza South, & through the Shellal positions recently evacuated by the Turks.  Our Brigade has been engaged in reconnaissance patrols & also in outpost duty along our advanced outpost.
