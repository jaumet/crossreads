 Re Joe's letter &amp; REVOLVER. I sent a Turkish one with Camel HAIR LEASH attached by Capt. Geo MILLS, a wounded flying man, the same family that had the photo sent you &ndash; Sydney DENTISTS out Parramatta way &ndash; hope he delivers soon. Lavender may have it. 
 I will give your letters to Laura. 
 We leave Blackpool midday today for LONDON &amp; arrive at 8 p.m. or 9, the way the trains run &ndash; for breakfast I had Porridge, Kippered Herrings, Sausage &amp; Egg &amp; toast &amp; Tea, so we do not starve.
