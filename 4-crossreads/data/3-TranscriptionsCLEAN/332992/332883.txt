We had tea three times today  We usually have soup instead of tea for dinner.I was on light duties again today.  This time in the cook house.  I scrubbed some tables and opened close upon 100 tins of bully beef for tea, also had a turn at the sausage machine.  I was again on duty after dinner grinding biscuits for porrage.There is an inspection of all Wards to day by eight doctors, some of them being English doctors, one a Lieut.
