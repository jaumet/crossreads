DEAR PEOPLE,
   Truly this life has taken me into some curious places, one lately has been a hundred feet up to the top of a chimney where our Artillery has established an Obser-vation Post officially known as an O.Pip.  The climb was done up iron bars placed across the inside of the chimney which were left when the chimney was built.  Three feet apart and deadly cold is this round iron bar, just about two inches in diameter and when at least the 31st bar has been surmounted and the landing reached one is very glad of a chance to rub his hands and restore circulation and warmth.  The artillery officer at the top is always a decent chap, "Have a cigarette" and "What can I do for you?"  Then it is explained that I want to see such-and-such an enemy trench, give him the map reference and he marks it with his pointer, and to emphasize it puts a couple of shots just in the rear of it from one of the 4.2 Howitzers.
  Then after much observation through his telescope, I descend the 31 steps, down a short steel ladder, crawl out through a hole knocked in the chimney, down a wooden ladder, then down to the trenches to confirm my observations.
   Well, that is just another experience and part of a day's work in preparation for a raid, it is followed at night by a trip into "No Man's Land," crawling over the ground ^across which we intend to advance to the attack.
