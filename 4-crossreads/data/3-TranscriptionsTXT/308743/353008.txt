 All through the night a constant rifle fire was kept up by both sides but no attack was launched by either side.  Downing left at 11 AM with the heads for Imbros Went for one usual at 1500 &amp; paid a visit to 706 where quite an interesting sight was seen, the Navy was carving small bits of Achi &amp; it was enveloped in smoke shells were bursting all along our front with great rapidity.  The Taube came over again &amp; let down a rain of [indecipherable] in Canterbury gully but no one was hit.  Turks give our positions a severe bombardment at sundown &amp; our guns give them the same [indecipherable] &amp; the trenches are a picture to see especially the Chess board.  Our 4.7 guns were firing tonight from their special emplacements &amp; are doing splendid work although the Turks have been shelling their positions for hours, but with little or no gain
