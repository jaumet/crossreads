conspiracy about me as Lol hints at twins in her letter. I would make you look [indecipherable] I fooled you by having twins. Dear Sis I do not what to think about what would have happened if Lol had not taken on work. It is pretty rotten when you come to think that there are hundreds of single railway boys over here getting their full money made up  & yet I had to resign. But thank goodness I have indeed got a wonderful wife. She also tells me that young Bob has obtained permission to get married, what a kick in the neck for Lol  & I especially if she hops right in for a baby but never mind I may get home some day to try my hand. Have not had a letter this mail from Aunt but perhaps it is delayed in Blighty
