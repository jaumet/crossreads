<p>9.10.16<br/>at 11.30 as the Cinema ran on till that time, the pictures were very good; yesterday was the Egyptian Xmas &amp; Alexandria looks rather gay with flags flying &amp; everything decorated up for the occasion. Arrived back at Camp at midnight, previous to going to the Cinema we witnessed a game of hockey on skates between a team from the American &amp; English navies, the Englishmen scoring an easy victory &amp; it is a very exciting game to watch.</p>
