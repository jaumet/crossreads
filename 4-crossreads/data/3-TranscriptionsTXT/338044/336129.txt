 In one of the ruined mosques of the citadel, I was shown some human bones. Remains of derelicts hanged from the top of the minarets &amp; picked to death by scavengers (birds). From here I also obtained a good view of the tombs of the Mameluks &amp; the Turkish prison at Maadi 
 5th Dec Sunday &amp; no work. I attend St Joseph's Church at Cairo a fine building    &amp;  beautiful interior. In the afternoon again visit the Pyramids. Feeling tired go to bed early. 
 6th Dec:- Have been transferred to Central Enquiry branch to-day. Casualty records    &amp;  on 3rd  &amp; 4th Batt. work. Rather monotonous but a change for a time.
