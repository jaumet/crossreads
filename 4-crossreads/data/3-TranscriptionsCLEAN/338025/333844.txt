Tuesday 13th November 1917Filled the nose bags (60) in the morning and afternoon.7.30 pm ordered to harness up and return to our waggon lines. Very foggy going home. At times I could hardly see my donks head. Arrived back to lines without any mishap about 10pm. Sorry to come back, as we were having a good time.
