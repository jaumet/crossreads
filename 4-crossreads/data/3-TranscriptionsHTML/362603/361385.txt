<p>You.  There are no pests in this Country that is one good thing.  Ellis went out after Rabbits but there were only about one or two.  He never had a shot.  He was eating the Blackberries off the Hedges while Dav &amp;   the Parson were wild-rabbit chasing.  Do you know Jurby?  You can reach it from either Sulby Bridge or Sulby Railway station.  It is about 20 minutes drive towards the West Coast from the Rly.  Ballaugh is quite near too.  They have a funny little Engine but it travels pretty well.  No through trains of course.  It takes about an Hour to go to Sulby Bridge.  The German Internes are working down the Sulby River.<br/>I suppose You messed around the Garden   &amp;   duck Houses while You were on Holidays.  I would just love to be digging up the old Garden again   &amp;   taking out a few more Rocks.  So You have copied Mr Currie's House at last.  It aught to look nice painted Grey.  Anything but Macs colour stone colour is too easily dirtied.<br/>Well Dad, I must close now.  News is right out, but Dave   &amp;   I are going to London on Tuesday so I may have something to Report when I return.<br/>Heaps of Love From Your own Boy<br/>Harry X</p>
