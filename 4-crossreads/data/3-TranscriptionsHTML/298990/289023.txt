<p>Poperinge</p>
<p>21/9/16  Ran over a motor lorry and blocked the line and disentrained and marched to the station.  Guide conducted us to Bde. HQ where General Gellibrand asked me to stay and we had a pleasant dinner &amp; so to bed.  The country hereabouts is exceedingly flat far more so than the north of France and is canalised.  The chief landmark is the hill of Cassell near Fleete some miles to the South. On top of this hill is a large monastery and we marched round the other side of this place on our way to the first Battle of the Somme.  Now at Ypres this hill is still our chief landmark.  The land has a slightly rank sodden appearance and is well cultivated by those peasants who remain in the locality.  The poplar and the elm appear in planted regularity and the pollard willow appears to be peculiar to these wet low countries.</p>
<p>22/9/16  An exquisite sunny day.  A Taube flew over after breakfast and was treated to a good shelling.  Our planes were active.  The boom of a big gun occurs occasionally and something fairly large went hurtling over our heads into Poperinghe.  The camp here is pitched on extremely low ground, most of which is boggy clay.  The men are housed in huts.  The roads are muddy and much cut up and transport is continually passing.  The reports of shells and lighter artillery reaches from in front and also the rattle of machine guns.  The General left for Paris this morning on 10 days permission and it seems as if they are keeping me here until my promotion comes out.  The weather is getting much colder and the days shortening as Autumn comes to us.  In a look round one sees a thinning of the foliage as the trees recommence the process of getting under bare poles.  Our observation baloons remained up until quite late a cold job for the observers.  An artillery rally took place about 7.  Yarned after mess with the Bde. Major and Staff Captain.  The peasants hereabout are rude and uncivilised kinds wearing rough moleskin clothes.  They appear dirty in person.  Flares at night define this Ypres salient very clearly.</p>
