El Arish, 22nd Dec.This camp is too good to last as usual.  There is a move or a stunt or something tonight.It is a weary world.
"Mag Dabeh", 23rd Dec.We left camp at six p.m. last night for a stunt to beyond Magdaba straight down the Wadi El Arish.We arrived there at daybreak having travelled all night as usual & found the turks a few miles further on.Engaged them & the left flank gave away at once & we have chased them away out of sight.  But on the right flank they are still holding us.  It is now 1 p.m. & so we have not much time before we shall have to go.  The whole division is out & a battery 18 pdr. & the C. Corps & a mountain battery.  The horses have had no water since we started.
