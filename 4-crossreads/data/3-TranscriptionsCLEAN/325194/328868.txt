  
 some time, tried to get some today in Cairo but no good, going to have another fly to -morrow 
 12.3.16 We got paid on the 10th  I collected 2.11.4 I put a chit in the pay book humbly requesting the payment of a fiver but I guess that chit hit the waste paper basket, but 50/- was better than nothing, We had a very good feed in fact we had a couple and then sat on the balcony of an hotel and drank beer looked at the picture and smoked 1/-
