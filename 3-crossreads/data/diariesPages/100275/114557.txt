if we are going to be relieved by the 2nd Division I don't envy them their job, they wont have it quite so hard as us for we had to take the position consolidate it.
26th. Last night about 11 oclock we filed out I think everyone breathed a silent prayer when they got clear of it, I know I did for I never expected to come out alive the 17th Battalion relieved us, when we got out to the Gordon dump our cooks had hot stew tea waiting for us how we enjoyed it, God alone knows what a relief it was to us to be out in the clear ground again among the light; men.
