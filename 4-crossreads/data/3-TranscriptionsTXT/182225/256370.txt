 1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 8 &nbsp; SEPT. 
 Fine &amp; warm. I went up to the dentist at Larkhill No 10 camp in morning to get a tooth stopped. It turned out the dentist (Lieut Tonkin I think) came home on the same boat as mother &amp; father a few years ago. Poss Nivison arrived &amp; was put into the 27 th &nbsp;Battery. He &amp; I went to the pictures at night but they were not much good. Warren Hogarth saw Campbell about his transfer &amp; Campbell nearly went mad. He said he was going to get him back at all costs.
