Steamboat eventually returned at 1.15 P.M. and reported very shallow water up the river, more especially to near where we lay, and at places only 11/2 fathoms deep, so that it was impossible for any steamboat to lay in hiding and so steamboat was hoisted, - we weighed anchor and proceeded South towards the Alalara Point.Feb 28th  before dawn we picked up our collier and ordered her to precede us to a certain rendezvous, at 8 Knots whilst we continued on our course according to plans.Feb 29th at 6.30 P.M. we anchored together with our collier at the mouth of the Amazon River.  The waters that were fast running down this river, was terribly thick and muddy and continued so for hundreds of miles out to sea, - it is known as one of the world's most longest rivers, and so of course it is only natural that it would posess a very strong current.March 1st at 5.30 am. ourselves and collier weighed anchor and proceeded up river.  At 10.30 AM we picked up pilot, and at 3.16 PM
