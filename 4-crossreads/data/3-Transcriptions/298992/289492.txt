<p>On another Farm<br/>Hill in France<br/>30/6/16</p>
<p>My Dear Father,</p>
<p>We have moved a step closer since I last wrote, and a beggar of a march it was. Had to carry everything we owned on our back, as well as two gas helmets, an iron shrapnel &amp; 150 rounds of ammunition a fair load altogether to bring 10 miles or so.</p>
<p>Well our Battalion went into the trenches last night, but I did not go with them. Some f4 or 5 days ago, I was told to report with 8 men to the Brigade Transport for duty, and thought it was just for a bit of guard work or something like that. On arriving here I found we were attached as brakesmen to the Transport permanently &amp; to the guards &amp; fatigues when necessary. At present I have been appointed Provost Corporal</p>
