<p>Thursday 1 February 1917</p>
<p>Just took my Squadron to Rail-Head to be DELOUSED - !!  "Modus operandi" &ndash; Engine supplies steam to closed in van into which each man's clothes &amp; Blankets are put he meanwhile going through a DIP &ndash;</p>
<p>[The following sentence crossed through]<br/>It would do some of those sheep owners who won't dip their LOUSY sheep to come here &amp; be dipped themselves.</p>
<p>Khamsin still blowing.</p>
<p>Reported enemy with their machine guns from planes on Yeomanry at EL BURG last night &ndash; I found several copper bullets &amp; shrapnel around our Bivies after last visit. Jim Ayre just read me a lot of HAY letters with much news of the River &amp; Riverina.</p>
<p>Still Bandaged up like a sore finger &ndash; pampering my neck as BAINS FATHER would say</p>
