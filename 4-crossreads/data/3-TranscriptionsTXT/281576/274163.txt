 Spent a most happy day on the cold hard floor.  Nothing to do, nothing to read.  Lovelock &amp; Jack Parsons came in during the night.  Lovelock was sent to the Conv. Hut.  For Dinner we had a little soup &amp; for Tea, a little B'd &amp; Butter &amp; Tea.  My underclothing is alive with Big Game &amp; sleep is out of the Question. 
 Tues. 5.  It's a big joke to call this a Rest Camp.  Everybody is lousy, the orderlies are so rushed with work they cannot tell one the time.  There's no water to have a wash &amp; taking things altogether, this place is perfect Hell.  The M.O. ordered me a No 9 &amp; Salts to follow &ndash; just because I wasn't an Anzac.  If a man said he was an Anzac, he got his Ticket marked C.C.S. which gave him a good chance of getting to Blighty.  The A.D.M.S. came round &amp; sent Lovelock away to C.C.S. A little soup for Dinner, a little Bread &amp; Butter for Tea, &amp; a couple of visits to the Latrines, make up the days events. 
 Wed. 6.  This morning the Doc. came round &amp; made me say "Ah".  I was [indecipherable] up of laying about in my lousy clothes &amp; asked him if I could get out.  He marked my Ticket Conv. Tent where I moved to immed. after Dinner.  I thought I was very unlucky to loose my pack, but there are 3 fellows in this Tent who only have a shirt &amp; pair of Pants, the rest was all taken away from 'em &amp; they haven't  been re issued yet.  At meal times we have to form a que &amp; march into a long brick Barn.  The Lord only knows how many men there are at this Camp, but we have to take 3 sittings to get through a meal &amp; what a scramble it is too.
