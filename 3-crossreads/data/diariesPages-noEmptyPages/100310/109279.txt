21/8/17 Campagne
Inspected the transport early in the morning sending out the Battn under Bunning. The inspection disclosed many little faults and quite confirmed me in the resolution to send Evans to a school and to put Thewlis on the job in his place. Carried out close order work on the ground all the morning, had lunch then did some company tactical exercises which were good. One strong post attack defence was rather realistic and we had a real German m.g (borrowed from DHQ) in it. Reached billets about 5 pm doing the march through the village at the slope. Fewer orderly room cases tonight. Formal mess having Padre Lambe for a guest and then some routine work and a yarn with the doctor which left me finished for the day at rather an earlier hour than usual. 10.35 and free to go to bed. Rodda goes back to his company in the morning W.J.C. carries on. 
22/8/17 Work in billets for morning. Baths afternoon.
