  
 front & not here"? Said he "SS Prince Abbas sailed past 1 hour early without orders". I said "y' thats the way you allow yr.[indecipherable] communication, its no wonder we all complain so". However he sent us to Afternoon Tea in the saloon & the purser gave us cabins of the best - a steward brought hot water & etcs. 
 About an hour after I had a bath - was just about to shave when in dashed the adjutant "looking for you everywhere - thought you'd gone ashore - the Prince Abbas we stopped along the coast & brought back - going in 5 minutes. So I knew then I had time for a shave etc - washed my one handkerchief - repacked & went aboard the 5th boat since leaving the shore. Rutledge had 4 parcels & I had the 3 & everywhere one had to climb up & down ships sides & move ships in relays. 
 After an hour the Abbas sailed - got dinner on board. French Company. Tipped the steward & got a cabin. 
 At 10 that night we arrived at Anzac & stopped 6 miles from the shore as the Fr. Egyptian Capt didn't like the shells closer in.

The Lk. Esk backed & the Abbas with Rutledge & my Knox box disappeared in a cloud of spray to Imbros Island & was not heard of for 24 hours - 
 My Captain returned to the Gascon & put back remainder of wounded & after arguing the point with him, I went on board her - the 7th boat in the journey. The submarine had not appeared again but had she come alongside, I shld. have jumped on the 8th boat & driven a boat hook through her. The Gascon not so good as the Sicilia - but I got lunch & met a nurse friend of Olive's named Durham from Sydney Hospital.
