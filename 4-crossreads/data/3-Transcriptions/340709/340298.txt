<p>The Song<br/>Tune: Marching Through Georgia<br/>Strap your belts and buckles on, and slope your blooming guns;<br/>Show our own loved Commonwealth that we are just the ones;<br/>Shove your manly bosoms out and prove we are the sons<br/>Who mean to be a credit to Australia.</p>
<p>CHORUS:- Hurrah! Hurrah! We don't know where we are<br/>Hurrah! Hurrah! We're on the "Berrima";<br/>We volunteered for service from our own Australia<br/>When we set out to capture Papua.</p>
<p>First we learnt the goose step, then to hold the gun;<br/>Then they taught us how to shoot at targets one by one,<br/>Then with our Hekometer we double out and run,<br/>To calculate the ranges for Australia.</p>
<p>CHORUS:- Hurrah! Hurrah! etc.</p>
<p>Our Expedition's No 1 we're always fresh &amp; fit;<br/>We're all the very best of pals, work hard, &amp; play a bit;<br/>We mean to leave the "Berrima" as models every whit,<br/>When we set out to capture Papua</p>
<p>CHORUS:- Hurrah! Hurrah! etc</p>
