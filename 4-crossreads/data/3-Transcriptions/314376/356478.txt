<p>167<br/>just on dark when we arrived.</p>
<p>Out way lay through the village and along a sunken road (just in front of Hermies) before we reached the front line. We found some very nice dugouts waiting for us which had been built by the previous occupants.</p>
<p>The position was a very level one away in the distance and it was possible to see Courtrai which was in the occupancy of the Germans. We stowed our packs underneath a tree and left.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a shell landed amongst them and scattered them all over the place. It blew up also a young man by the man of Stringfeller.</p>
<p>It was snowing as we took over the trenches and the ground was covered.</p>
