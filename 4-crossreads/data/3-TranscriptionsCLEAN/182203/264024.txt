That morning (Sunday.) one of the sisters from our hospital had asked me to drive into Alex. with her, so we had just left went Mr.C. rang-up. We did not return until 12.45 so I rang-up &   told him. He said he could wait for me, so I just got the Gharry & drove back to Alex but he had a mighty long wait. The blooming tyre came off the back wheel of the carriage - so I finially arrive at The Savoy at 2. p.m.
