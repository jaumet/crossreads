gave me, all Tuesday off-duty , So we got a yacht at 9. a.m.  & had a lovely sail until nearly 1. p.m. Then went to the French Club (the only meal we are allowed to go to) for lunch, then to the station to see my darling off by the 2. p.m. train. You cannot imagine how miserable I felt. Went back to Home &  try to make myself busy mending sockings. etc.To my surprise d & delight about 9.p.m. I received another wire saying their departure was cancelled. The poor chap will be very disappointed but he says one thing he came can be nearer me now for a little longer. I had quite made up my mind not to ask for Transport to Australia - thinking we would be leaving for France or England soon but there does not seem to be any hope, so I'm talking the matter over with Jackson to-morrow, if he can get down.It has been frightfully hot these last three days & I'm sure I could not stand another summer here. I had a slight return of my old complaint yesterday
