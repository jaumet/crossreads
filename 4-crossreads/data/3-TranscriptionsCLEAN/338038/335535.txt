  
 bend of the Railway Embankment at DERNACOURT, that devoted line never changed throughout that glorious day or afterwards. By 2 p.m. on the 5th April, 1918, nearly half the Officers and men serving the guns of the Australian Divisional Artillery were "out of action" but in spite of the heavy losses and concentrated fire of the hostile Artillery, all guns remained "in action" and played their part throughout the day though in some instances only manned by two gunners. 
 It is characteristic of the recent War, and of our Arm, that the enduring service and sacrifices of the Artillery is seldom written about and mentioned in the records, of these great and historical actions of the combined Arms and in which they so effectually and gloriously took part. 
 Of all the splendid service and individual devotion to duty which marked the sad but memorable day and which makes the 5th April, 1918, one of the proudest in all the records of Australian Artillery, there was none who rendered more sterling service or who has left a brighter and more enduring example of personal devotion and sacrifice than your son, Major Terence Garling. 
 You know already what his men and brother Officers thought of him, and what personally I tried to express to you, who knew him from Gallipoli onwards and therefore on this Anniversary of that glorious and gallant period three years ago, and in spite of the sadness and inevitable sense of loss which comes to us all, and to you in particular, I can only say to you again that the memory of that gallant service and individual devotion will still help us to recall the 5th April, with sad but last pride in the men who gave so much on that Great Day. 
 May I again thank you for your letter and kind remembrance.  With all the kindliest and sincerest wishes for the welfare of you and yours. 
 Believe me, Yours very sincerely, 
 W.L.H. Burgess (Late Brig. General, C.R.A. 4th Aust. Division)
