  
 even though often hard worked of course we all are inured to Rifle fire & the fall of Bullets & occasionally shell & shrapnell fire too. I must say I most distinctly do  not  like shrapnell & dive for shelter when I hear it comming. Sniping if we are at long Range is treated by all with Contempt but if our ardent friend is at short Range then one &  all are wary &  so Casualties are avoided by care &  common sense I trust you & the Dr. are both well. Diarrhoe seems to be the chief complaint if a man is sick, I am glad to say that I have kept well up to the present we have a Dentist here & I have had the novel experience of having a Tooth stopped in the open [with] the Trenches active 
 Grace will give you my address Best wishes to you all G R Short
