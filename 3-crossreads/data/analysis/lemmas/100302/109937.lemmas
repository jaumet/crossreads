It is a dull morn and grey sea are run , we can see high mountain in the distanc upon which snow is plain visibl and the Chief Engineer point out where Mont Carlo is . The snow on these Alps seem veri heavi and the air is veri cold . We shall need all our heavi cloth in this countri .

After lunch Marseill could be glimps nestl behind a curv in the coast , we stood close in to the precipit cliff which rise to the height of the Maritim Alps . Love sceneri , the rock appear of a light charact and the slope are wood . Some of the cliff are dread steep and project sheer into the sea most abrupt . It was veri pleasant run along this love place . Come closer we began to take a most devious cours tack backward and forward . The first thing to catch the eye upon an emin was a Cathedr on the top of which was a gild imag of Christ veri larg . Perch upon a high rock this overlook the citi and the brillianc of the statu attract the eye . The citi ( about 500,000 ) is scatter along the shore and the high mountain rise close behind make an impress background . To the right of the town is a thick forest of fine deep green tree nestl among which are mani chateux . green the roof of some is all that can be seen . A delight scene .
