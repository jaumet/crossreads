a great many years about 20 I think.  She is religious & is industrious & dresses tastefully & is "just the thing" in every way.  I gave her a ring with a nice pearl surrounded by 8 small diamonds which she chose herself & which I admire very much.  I can't persuade her to marry me before I go unless they keep me here about 6 months - which is not improbable as others have been kept as long - because she wants time to get her trousseau together & wants her sister who is a Sister at Mena Hospital to be with her at the time & other reasons.  Her name is Edith May Green, & Gooloowan, Victoria Avenue, Canterbury, Vic. is her address so I see her when I am lucky enough to get leave.With many thanks & kindest regards to you & the Doctor & love to Margaret.
Yours affectionately,Arthur M. Davidson.
