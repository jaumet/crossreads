Thursday 28 June 1917
Had no mail from AUSTRALIA for a month now & no further ENGLISH news but we must be patient. I enclose with these a collection of snaps not very good but they may interest you. Weather warmer & I'm reducing my KIT to 2 Blankets. Flies in 1000s & the Horses with docked tails & manes are suffering.
The first thing an Englishman does is to cut the tail & mane off.
Post this with love to all as tomorrow we will be further away.
