<p>Mar 2<sup><u>nd</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;I went out at 8.A.M. &amp; took a fatigue party of 45<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;Battalion up to Vierstradt. it was very cold &amp; windy &amp; snowed a bit in the afternoon - We slept well on our new beds last night. the night was cold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Memo</u>. &nbsp;Weather mostly cold &amp; windy. with spells of bright sun, this week - Fritz raided our lines on Friday night whilst our 13<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;battalion was changing over but he came a thud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mar. 3<sup><u>rd</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Still cold but the wind dropped towards afternoon - We cleaned the lorry in the morning &amp; did nothing in the afternoon. In the evening we went up to Suzanne&#39;s for a while then came home &amp; did some Pelman</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mar. 4<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We did&#39;nt go out to day. we are said to have finished with the chows now. we went up to Suzanne&#39;s in the afternoon &amp; took their photos to them. fairly cold all day but no wind, it rained in the evening. It looks like Japan coming into the war -</p>
