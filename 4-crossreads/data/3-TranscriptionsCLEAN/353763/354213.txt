  Buz  has it - the Australian fleet & the Frenchmen are off out somewhere & that the Japanese flag ship is coming in & that a Jap Admiral is to be in charge of all of us  -  What we want with Frenchmen & Japs down here is a mystery to all of us but of course we are the puppets & not  the  Head quarters  - 
  Buz  has it that the Grantala is a very proper strict ship  -  No larking there  -  Everyone has to be sterilised twice a day!!! No fruit from the shore & no shore water allowed & everyone got to take his quinine daily  -  Well - well - my result & that is - health for one & all - is maintained at far less cost & irritation  -
