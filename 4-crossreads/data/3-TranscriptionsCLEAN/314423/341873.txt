  
 and cloudy all day with an inclination to freeze. Shoeing again today. The papers report great strikes and industrial unrest  in German industrial towns. This is the first day of February and it is current belief that the war is going to end this winter if not by the end of this month. I have some doubt about it, but I think it will end this year. The weather this past month has been much milder than this time last year. The month has slipped by very fast and pleasantly due in part my recent trip to England and Ireland and the weather being so mild and everything in the Transport running more smoothly than usual.  Friday  Saturday February 2. 1918. 1279 A beautiful day. Cold & frosty last night. I put a full set of shoes on a mule driven by Bill Campbell this morning & in the afternoon got some shoes ready. There were a few enemy planes about today but they were dispersed by our archies. Sunday February 3, 1918. 1280. A nice fine day I shod L.Kynes mule and the doctor's horse this morning. There was the usual half holiday this afternoon and I stayed in and wrote some letters.
