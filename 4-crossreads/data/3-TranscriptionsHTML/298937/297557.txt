<p>prisoners recently sent to Prisn No. 2.  Average number of 40 oz. bottles sent there daily is 8, &amp; that is quite apart from our own use, ointments, eye &amp; ear drops, special prescriptions &amp; Citadel medicines.  It is not easy for me to keep pace with the rush sometimes, having a very painful foot.</p>
<p>Tuesday 4th April</p>
<p>This afternoon was my holiday, but although the foot is mending, it is not nearly well enough for me to go out.<br/>Studied Latin, with which I am improving, &amp; French, with which I am not.</p>
