  
 of the heavy casualties was ordered out to the line about 9 AM.  Walked about 7 miles to the post & commenced carrying immediately.  First case I assisted to carry was Capt Smythe of the 56th wounded in leg. 
 Carrying all through night in a blizzard, far from pleasant circumstances. 
 Tuesday 3.4.17 Glad to see daylight, ground covered with snow, still a lot of casualties coming through.  Had no sleep during night, feeling rather tired.  Fritz brought down a couple of our baloons in flames; a beautiful piece of work amid a hornet's nest of machine guns & anti-aircraft guns.  Two of Fritz's planes brought down earlier in the afternoon.
