The streets are fine & the place looks grand at night time, it is so well lit up & we have been used to such dark towns.  Well, my dear ones, we have come to the best camp & best place on our Travels this time & again on the 13th.  Is it not strange?  We expect to be here 6 or 8 months & by that time we aught to be marching Home to you all.  It is supper time now, so I will join the Boys & then I must toddle off to shave & go to bed.
We are as happy as can be & now we may be sure to be Home for X'mas 1819.
Best of Love to you all,Harry.
