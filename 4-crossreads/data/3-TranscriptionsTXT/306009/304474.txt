 1915 Oct. 19 Tue. At 2.30 p.m. went off for a good long walk through the Island &amp; then across to Giza as far as the Nerada Bridge which was open when I reached it, to enable the great lanteen sailed feluccas &amp; khiassas to go up the river. Came back to the Zoo and had a look around at the Birds &amp; Animals &ndash; also went through the fine grotto. Went back to Gezira by tram. After tea the Army Pay Corps gave a good concert in Ward 1.
