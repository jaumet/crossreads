<p>Present, and the Captain Ferguson's people will have no difficulty in finding his grave.</p>
<p>I am glad to know you are getting on well in the R.F.C. I expect you are one of the fellows who sometimes wake me out of my best sleep in Pinner these early summer mornings.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br/>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>E.A. Box</p>
<p>P.S.  Perhaps Ferguson's people would care to know somethings about his grave. I may be over there during the month &amp; I shall try &amp;  find it tho' it is a pretty hot Corner . There is a village quite near the Bois in which I have sheltered on occasion; and where the peasants are keeping the graves quite tidy: the last place in the world one would expect to see War is Sailly &ndash; the crops are growing &amp;  birds singing right up to the front.</p>
