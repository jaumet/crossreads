The Whole Ambulance was supposed to move forward some three miles & open up a Main Dressing Station - the order seemed to be cancelled later - or perhaps our gains are not as great as anticipated. Wounded men tell us that the 10th Batt men are in Bapaume - practically no resistance? - supposed gains along the line are from 1,000 yds to 5 miles. Got a batch of 50 reinforcements.
Monday  26/2/17
Quite night - Slight rain - Fine day mostly - Planes & Balloons up in the evening - All reinforcements sent on to relieve posts - Poor devils were nearly scared to death at the prevailing conditions & Fritzs barrages. Fairly busy - Very heavy Artillery firing throughout the night - expect good news after it. Nothing official of our gains yet.
Tuesday  27/2/17
Dull day - fairly warm & dry - Got news that Bapaume is not in our hands yet, but have taken the Villages of Pys - Serre & Miraumont
