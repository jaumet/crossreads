 F. We crossed the line last night or early this morning. I go on Boat deck with Jack for afternoon tea. I see a shark & lots of flying fish. I try to do some book-keeping but all the mob on the arell[?] deck singing the songs shown on the screen put me off altogether. So I read instead.

 F. Lovely day. Church parade & we sit on balcony. Hear story of 2 frogs in a bucket of milk. Comforts issued. Socks, Treacle, Biscuits, Cigs etc. watch rather pretty sunset. I am all dressed up & nowhere to go. 
 Very cool day, strong head wind & a little swell. Sleep up aloft.
