<p>thoughts of starting on their journey and today Tuesday three Imperial Boys have just left us for their base, they are all 1914 boys and are well entitled to their transfer, two of them are Fireman from Wales and the other a clerk from the Railways, we wished them all good luck and a quick trip to their homes, and now we only have two Imperial Boys left with us and I expect they will be called away ant time now. Rumors are about that we all will be moving some time next week, but as one hears so much many rumors that it is no good taking any notice, anyhow when the time does come it will be quick and lively, the weather today is bad, one minute it is raining and the next the sun is trying very hard to shine through the clouds. The clouds as a rule come up very thick and black and one expects heavy rain but as a rule it passes</p>
