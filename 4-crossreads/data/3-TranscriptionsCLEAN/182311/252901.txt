    It has meant hard work for us all, it has meant much danger too, but comparatively speaking our casualties have been light, and though others who have shown to the enemy a front less bold, who were less daring in their seizure of positions of vantage, have paid heavily, our cost has been much less beacuse of our strength. 
    Some day I'll write of incidents in this eventful career of ours, but just at present am too busy for any lengthy epistles, so I'll shut off now with every jolly good wish. 
   
 Sincerely yours, 
   
 HAROLD.
