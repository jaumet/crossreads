<p>waters edge on Cap Martin it commands a view both up and down the coast</p>
<p>from San Remo (the principal town of the Italian Riviera) on the left,</p>
<p>down past Monte Carlo and Monarco to Nice on the right.&nbsp; The sea is a</p>
<p>deep blue, the towns consists of white houses with red roofs and rising</p>
<p>up half a mile back from the beach the snow capped Alps finish a picture</p>
<p>of wonderful beauty.&nbsp; The highly colored views one sometimes sees of the</p>
<p>Riviera are by no means exaggerated.&nbsp; The Landscape Gardener has worked</p>
<p>wonders all along this coast and has introduced plants, shrubs, and trees</p>
<p>from all parts of the world and frequently their native soil has to be</p>
<p>brought with them to get them started.&nbsp; The tendency is towards</p>
<p>tropical rather than Northern foliage and results have been obtained</p>
<p>superior to the same plants or trees in their own native countries.</p>
<p>This specially applies to tree ferns and the more heavy varieties of</p>
<p>palms, but there are also Australian trees the splendid condition of</p>
<p>which would make Mr. Maiden green with envy.&nbsp; Eucalyptus and other</p>
<p>species of the Gum tree are here in great quantities:&nbsp; one road near Nice</p>
<p>through which I drove was bordered for two miles with Gums whose</p>
<p>tendency to sprawl out had been checked by liberal pruning each year</p>
<p>with the result that they have developed into fine shapely trees.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>Currajong is another tree which does well here, and one sees both the</p>
<p>big fellow which makes our Western sheep farmers glad and the smaller</p>
<p>symmetrical chap used mostly for ornamental purposes.&nbsp; It is rather</p>
<p>worthy of note that the Prince of Monarco has made use of this latter</p>
<p>tree in his wonderful Casino Garden at Monte Carlo.&nbsp; This garden,</p>
<p>probably the most famous thing of its kind in the World consists of</p>
<p>an oblong strip running from the main street of Monte Carlo down a</p>
<p>slight decline to the main entrance of the Casino, probably about</p>
<p>half an acre in extent.&nbsp; It is bordered by alternate Currajongs and</p>
<p>a species of tree palms the trunks of which match those of the</p>
<p>Currajong in so much as they are about the same thickness and taper</p>
