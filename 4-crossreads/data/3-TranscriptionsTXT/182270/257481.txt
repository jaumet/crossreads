 WEDNESDAY, JUNE 18, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; cold. Father &amp; Mother &amp; Peter &amp; I 
 went into Quirindi in the big car. 
 Father &amp; I attended the court &amp; were 
 fined &pound;5 &amp; costs for not killing rabbits 
 They went home for lunch &amp; I stayed 
 in. Went up to &quot;Woodlawn&quot; with 
 Owie &amp; Laurie &amp; played tennis all 
 the afternoon. Caught the 9.30 train 
 to Sydney at night.
