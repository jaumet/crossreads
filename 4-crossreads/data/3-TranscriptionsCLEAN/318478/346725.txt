  
 March 9th 1919 
 The last day of my Peninsular work.  And the hopes of yesterday namely that God was willing were justified;  at the same time it took more of my humble co-operation than I generally put up.  I did my final sketch this morning  of  choosing Helles beach with the ruined fort called 'Seddel Bahr' on the left and Helles cliff or promontery on the right, the Clyde and two other vessells beached & ruined houses & green grass in the foreground. [Drawing] I managed to work it to stay on at Helles until I finished my sketch coming on to Kilid Bar [Bahr] by tin Lizzie
