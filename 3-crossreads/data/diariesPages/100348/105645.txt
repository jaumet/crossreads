other light labour, for eight hours each day. Working today clearing down a luxurious German dugout, it has several rooms, wall paper on the walls, electric light, and bell system. And proof against anything but british troops with bomb and bayonet. They say it was a hospital; for the body of a female nurse was found in one of its galleries. Not the first time I have seen traces of women in German dugouts. The Hun defences here were immensely strong; I will enjoy demolishing them. It is better than the firing line. Was paid 20.Frs

Continued the salvage work yesterday. I went with a party this morning, to work on the construction of a new camp called "Sydney"
