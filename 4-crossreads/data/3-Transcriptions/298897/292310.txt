<p>candles &amp; images etc. were carried in profusion &amp; chantings, incantations etc were freely delivered.  The route was strewn with leaves &amp; rosepetals etc.  About 50 R.C.'s, Australians, joined in the show.  It was the saddest spectacle I have yet witnessed the large number of widows &amp; those dressed in mourning &amp; the almost entire absence of able bodied men bore mute witness to the ravages of the war.  Practically all are in mourning &amp; the youths left are about to be used.  One cannot quite realise the awfulness of the war.</p>
<p>Monday 3rd July<br/>Very little doing a few sick being treated throughout the day.  Spent a certain amount of time fagging French &amp; find it fairly easy to make myself understood.  Tis wonderful how easy it is to converse with a person by the help of signs, a few words here &amp; there etc etc.  Witnessed an air duel this morning but could not see the result as they went out of sight.  Great care is taken by the authorities to prevent information leaking out as to the position of units etc we not being allowed to write down where to send a patient, as that would state</p>
