15 Sept, 1916Bir El HassaniyaIts 'Ot" as the proverbial "Obs", to day. now & then a breath of wind puffs along & feels cool & nice against ones sweaty face  To night we start out on a stunt.  We are going to look for stouch.  Some one has an idea that Abdul is longing for a chance to toss in the sponge & take a trip over the canal, I wonder?  We are carrying 60 Rds amm extra to help to persuade him that the desert is a very unhealthy place to live in.  Thirty miles out!  Wont it be a real joy ride in for the wounded.  We are supposed to attack Sunday morning - I believe my horse is still doing a fast.  I had to pet him & call him horrid names in the most soothing tone to coax him to deign to drink too buckets this morning & he ate a few mouth fuls of grain I pinched but guess he'll come at it later.
