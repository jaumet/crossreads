<p>sighted since we left Dakar.  We have had glorious weather since we left.  Our first sight of the Cape was Table Mountain which is some considerable height.  We expected to call in at the Cape town but to our dissappointment we did not, I losing a half crown on the deal.  We had news via wireless that a great reception was awaiting us if we were coming into port.</p>
<p>9-2-16<br/>Today is my birthday which is celebrated on board in the Indian Ocean.  The day was spent in reading &amp; having a lazy day of sunshine.  We are about 300 miles from Capetown so this is where I spent my 22nd Birthday.</p>
<p>17-2-15 [17-2-16]<br/>Have not seen Land for about ten days so have not much news this last few days have been verry cold, we being down about 44 deg. below the equator.  We are now about seven days sail from Albany, it being our next port of call to drop our west boys.  Tonight at 8.00 we droped a life buoy overboard with the latest flare attached to it.  We watched it for six minutes &amp; then it dissappeared.  We covered 1&frac12; miles in that time.</p>
<p>23-2-16<br/>Have arrived at W.A., Freamantle at 2.45 p.m., we tied up at about five oclock after the Quack had inspected us.</p>
