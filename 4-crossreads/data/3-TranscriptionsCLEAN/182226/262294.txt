 On guard again. 
 It is a glorious morning. Just like a morning in December at home only not so hot. I am thoroughly enjoying it. 
 The rumble of the warships guns on the right is now incessant. They are miles away from us & yet the ground seems to tremble when they are fired. 
 Mac took some papers to Capt Fitzgerald & in the goodness of his heart gave him pretty near all we had in the place. So we are stranded for spare paper till next mail, I'll see that he isn't so kind hearted next time. 
 We have been told that we will be out of here by November but in the words of the Scotchman "I hae ma doots". 
 The 17 th  Field team of siege artillery gave "Abdul" a surprise. They landed about 12 very high explosive shells in the Chess Board. They were just like young earthquakes.
