Monday 30 August, 1915
6 men were sent out to get our kit bags which we had to discard last Monday. Mac & I had a swim. Its pleasures were somewhat marred by a few shells from "Beachy Bill".
Our shifts have been changed. Each man does 2 hrs on & 6 off. We go on at night from 6 to 8 & then from 2 to 4. At 4 o'clock all men have to stand to arms till 5, we can then have a couple of hours sleep till 7 so it is no picnic here.
The Turks are sending the shells closer to our camp every day. This afternoon one lobbed only 60 yards away. We are expecting one through the roof next. We are badly off for news, have not had a letter for over a fortnight.
I hope to have a shave tomorrow, first for a fortnight. I look a regular hero with all that growth on.
Some Italian officers have been floating about here & there is a roumer that they are landing 30,000 men, lets hope so as it will end this all the quicker.
