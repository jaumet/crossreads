<p>Thursday 6 June<br/>Up at the Aid Post again, but before I left Borre I saw the most thrilling air fight of my life.  The Bosch, in a machine almost red, was endeavouring to elude four of our chaps &amp; after most magnificent manouvering, very low down had to land at Hazebrouck.  It is said that he has twenty three machines to his credit &amp; apparently belonged to the famous "circus" formed by the late Richtoften.</p>
<p>Friday 7 June<br/>Things are very quiet here to-day.  There has been a 9.45 mortar put in position behind us &amp; when it fires it will draw crabs.</p>
