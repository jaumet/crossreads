<p>My Dear Mother &amp; Father</p>
<p>Taking into consideration my 'luck' as it has been, up to date, you must not be surprised to see that I'm still posting my letters in the same old box. Under very different conditions now, though!  Spring has arrived with evident intentions to make up for past delays. In one week the change passed from snow, ice, quagmires of slush and filth unspeakable, &amp; general desolate greyness &ndash; to warm sunshine, earth dry &amp; hard as cement, scarcity of water and an intense monotony of vivid green. It is now three weeks that no rain has fallen and you can just imagine us basking in the sun like re-patriated cats! Of course, under the circs, we do little or no work, being content to let the dogs sleep on as long as they will. Some fine day they must wake and find us &ndash; then we will be ready for work.</p>
<p>I have a note to-day from Mrs Horton; she writes to tell me, with evident relief, that the youngster, Elsie, had had a long &amp; interesting letter from Charlie (dated April 25th). He was then well &amp; going strong</p>
