eager the majority of the business people seem to want to sell (Australians particularly) a number of souvenirs & rubbish. The streets in many cases are very narrow & the Trams make one incessant clanging with their bells & the yelling of the excitable Egyptian Drivers. Trams are Electric but small. We had dinner at Petrogad a first class Hotel finishing the evening by a visit to the Kursall (Vaudeville House) One could spend hours sitting in a Cafe watching the Cosmopolitan crowd pass by. Drove back to camp & sneaked in just after roll call.Sunday July 29We visited Pyramids & Sphinx today. Situated some 10 miles from Town. Drove out in Motor Beautiful drive along absolutely flat road.
