<p>Wednesday 17th Oct. fine but prospects of rain, was put on R. Boat Roll (Supplementary) &amp; warned not to leave camp, an hour later a couple of dozen were told they were on the roll &amp; the rest practically struck off. All those struck off came from Codford with me. We are very unfortunate alway being messed about. Concert tonight.</p>
