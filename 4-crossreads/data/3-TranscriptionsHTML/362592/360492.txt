<p>The Mercenaries.</p>
<p>These, in the day when Heaven was falling,<br/>The hour when earth's foundation fled,<br/>Followed their mercenary calling<br/>And took their wages &ndash; and are dead.<br/>Their shoulders held the sky suspended,<br/>They stood, and earth's foundations stay:<br/>What God abandoned these defended,<br/>And saved the soul of things &ndash; for pay.</p>
<p>Housman.</p>
