from us.   We stop the night at Reninghelst & then entrain - for what.   Time will tell as this is to be the most momentous period in the Great War.
Tuesday 26 March    Up at 7. A.M. ready for a good days work.   The main body left at 10 A.M. leaving about 10 men to clean up help to pack & shift the gear.   My part was completed before midday when I set to & helped the S.M. to complete his section.   Going back to the camp was most depressing, silent & deserted, the huts splinted & torn & clothing & gear of all kind in abundance.   The village itself was deserted practically no troops to be seen & this was typical of the whole district, all seem to be on the way to the great conflict.   About 4 oclock all was square & I picked up the crowd by car at Van Sohiers Farm near Poperinghe where we had been once before.  It was now cold & after tea started skylarking to get warm finishing up with a game of hockey fiercely contested.   All are in good
