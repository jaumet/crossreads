  
 going to take his girl to the theatre he is going back to Camp tomorrow 
 Received a splendid parcel this morning from Mrs Oliver, will keep us going for a week in luxuries nearly, I don't know what the nurses here think I am or must be for I have been getting bags of letters & papers & telegrams, & about 20 parcels, & all good stuff at that. 
 7th. It has been a miserable day a light misty rain having started early this morning & continued throughout the day. 
 8th.   Quite a change this morning for the sun is shining brightly & things look very nice. 
 We have some great fun in the wards here with the nurses over Australian customs habits & etc.
