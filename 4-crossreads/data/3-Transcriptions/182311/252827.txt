<p>of another and very powerful &quot;bombard&quot; ten miles away perhaps, and which also is probably the cover for a raid.&nbsp; Fritz is to have no rest this winter, for the settled policy all along the front is raid - raid - raid.&nbsp; Last winter he improved his defences, built himself concrete dugouts and made trenches that formed serious setbacks and obstacles to our advance, this time &quot;Harry the Hun&quot; is our motto.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I will thank you for your prayers and good wishes, I want them all and value them too.&nbsp; I often think of home but it&#39;s a place in another world, where it is sunny and warm, and old friends cluster round.&nbsp; I hope I&#39;ll find it so on my return,, I think I will but it is a long way from here and a very different state of things are here with us now &quot;in the living Present.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, with all good wishes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAROLD.</p>
