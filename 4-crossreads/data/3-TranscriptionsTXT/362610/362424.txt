Thursday 27 July 1916Spelling in the transport paddock outside Albert during the morning, once being awakened by someone who proved to Jocelyn Carr paying a visit to see how I was getting on. In the afternoon we got our orders to move & by a very roundabout route we went to a thick wood on a hill near Contay & there camped in Canadian huts. My duty was to bring along cripples in a motor lorry in rear so I was saved the tramp. Visited by General Birdwood & Lord Northcliffe & cinematograph pictures of the visit were made.
