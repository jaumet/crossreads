<p>4-8-16<br/>Fri 4th<br/>The second Bde came in about 11 oclock last night &amp; the Turks followed them in, &amp; at midnight we got the alarm &amp; were out in quick time &amp; found the Turks at the entrance to the camp just before daylight our outposts were retiring &amp; fighting their way back;  we rode up close to the Turks dismounted for action &amp; were soon in the thick of it just at dawn.</p>
<p>The Turks were coming up the gully in hundreds &amp; the closest were within 100 yards of us when we opened fire , &amp; they charged yelling Allah Allah, but again Allah deserted them &amp; they fell thick &amp; fast &amp; the fight ended with both sides taking whatever cover they could &amp; sniping;  at this we more than held our own although the Turkish machine guns made our positions rather uncomfortable</p>
