28/1/18 London
First tubed to the Bank and went from there by bus to Piccadilly Circus. Wren's churches meet the eye everywhere. Watched the Guard mounting at St James? Palace and then did a great amount of walking round various parts of the City, coming right back to Westminster near the Houses of Parliament and there lunching for 8d at one of Lyon's cafes. Walked round the outside of the Abbey and round to the Commons. Returned to hotel and changed into uniform and then went along to Berkleys to get service stripes c sewed thereon. Met a Rhodesian officer here who was in the guns on our left at Bullecourt. To the House of Commons and had to wait until 3.15 before getting admitted and had an interesting talk to an American doctor.
