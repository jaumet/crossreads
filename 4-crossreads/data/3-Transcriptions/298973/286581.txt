<p>France<br/>21st November 1916</p>
<p>Dear old chap</p>
<p>I received your letter dated 11-11-16 yesterday 20-11-16, here in France. Noel old chap, accept from me in your great grief just all and more consolation &amp; sympathy than I am (unfortunately) able to offer. The loss of a brother is a thing one can't write about. When I'm writing about dear old Alan I just choke &ndash; and write something totally inadequate.<br/>Let me say that, in losing an old pal like old him, I'm just hit all over again like I was when I heard of Alan's end. Nim was a lad I had the greatest respect for, and absolutely one of my best pals. I would have known him all my life, as a true man and a pal who had not a dirty trick in him. He was a lovable old chap, just one of the boys I was longing to look up &amp; shake hands with over here. It's wonderful how you two boys stuck together, and it must have been very consoling to you both at the end.</p>
