16/9/18 Cappy
It was a beautiful fine day. We marched to Divnl Sports near Eclusier and they proved a great turnout. The tote and Tatts-sur-Somme were busy ? a crowd of gamblers. The great event of the day was the Band Competition well won by 4th Battalion We crashed on the music - being first the men were nervous and had no wind. There were some fine bands here. The 21st were second. Some nurses arrived and Birdwood Monash Rosenthal were also there. Fell in with and yarned to some of the former and then drifted on to some of the latter. Some good fancy costumes. A lovely view from here today over the surrounding country. Returned to camp about 8 after a day full of varied experiences and very enjoyable.
