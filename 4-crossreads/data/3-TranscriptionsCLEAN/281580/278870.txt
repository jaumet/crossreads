  
 29th  Octr /17. I omitted an incident which has re-occurred to me from yesterday, and which shows in some degree the morale of our men.  Whilst sheltering in a dugout on Westhock ridge, which commanded a fine view of the road leading up, the Boshe opened up a barrage on it.  (This road he has under keen observation on account of it being one of the main supply channels). His gunnery precision was admirable and made the road impassable. Some of our ammunition (Australian) drivers however disregarded the risk and whipping up rode through it, the event was thrilling exciting as shells seemed and did lob right alongside them. My companions in refuge also felt the thrill, and cheered and made bets on the Issue. I have seen numerous other similar occurrences which show the fine coolness and nerve of the Australian troops.
