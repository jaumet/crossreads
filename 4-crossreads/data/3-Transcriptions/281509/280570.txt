<p>1916 December 13<br/>Wednesday</p>
<p>For a wonder no casualties brought down after last night. one man killed. We are to be relieved today. Relief comes in afternoon. Fritz gives us a few parting shells as a farewell. Back to Longueval without incident. Mud &amp; more mud. Shiver &amp; groan all night with the cold.<br/>Mary's Xmas parcel arrives &amp; what a mine of wealth it contained. Sweets &amp; dainties of all sorts. How welcome they are.</p>
