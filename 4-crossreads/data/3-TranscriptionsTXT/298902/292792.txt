Bushey Heath where D.W.A had her abode.  Had tea & supper out here & pleasant evening, returning to town about 11 P.M.  Made arrangements for tomorrow.  Sent off a cable to Sydney announcing the fact of my being on leave.
Sunday 1st Dec,  Wet morning.  Did some writing & then went along to Piccadilly tube where I met D.W.A.  Had lunch at Slaters & then walked down to Pall Mall in order to see the arrival of Foch, & Clemenceau, Baron Sonnino & Orlando.  They passed in the Royal Carriages, first Duke of Connaught with Foch, next Clemenceau with Lloyd George then the two Italians.  They each received a splendid welcome.  The route was beflagged & the huge crowd which lined the way gave the typical British welcome, a long & throaty cheer commencing in the distance & travelling
