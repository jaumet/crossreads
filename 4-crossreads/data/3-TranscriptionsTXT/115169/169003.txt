 May 21st [1919] 9.50 am. On our arrival at Sydney Heads for the first time since Oct 17th 1914, we were welcomed by the Governor General Sir Munro Ferguson whose flag was flown from masthead of the special service vessel "Franklin" and which led us up the Sydney Harbour. The ferries, motor launches and steam boats lined our course, and rousing cheer upon cheer and Coo-ee's were sent up continually upon our return and so under such an enthusiastic welcome we made our way to Garden Island whilst the six destroyers secured to buoys previously allotted to them As soon as possible the Governor General came on board "Melbourne" and personally welcomed our return to Sydney and Australia after having done our duty as he said May 22nd  A Banquet was given at the Town Hall in our Honour and invitations extended to all officers and men, many speeches were given and the event was a huge success.
