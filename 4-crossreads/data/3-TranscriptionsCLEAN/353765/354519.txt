A Major in way & blocked our passage. Had peep thro' look outs, nothing to be seen. Read papers all afternoon. Aeroplanes flying very low. Dropped 3 bombs on Turkish positions.

Destroyer bombarding near Olive Grove  supposed  Thought to be Turkish transport of supplies. Fort returning fire, shooting wide at times, some fairly close. A Lieut who knew me but whom I couldn't place, called to see poor old Wiggie, he got shock when he heard he was killed. Came from Bismarck same place as Wigie. 15th - Hydroplane flying round the supply ships etc in the bay, evidently watching for  the  a subm. Ammunition boat probably there.
