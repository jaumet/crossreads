<p>[Telegram form &ndash; marked ten/2]<br/>[Continuation of Ashmead Bartlet's report on the combined British/Anzac operations at Suvla Bay and Lone Pine, 6th to 10th August]<br/>But even this concentrated artillery fire might not have checked the Turkish advance unless it had been assisted by the concentrated fire of ten machine guns directed by the famous Hythe [musketry school] shot Sargeant  Major Wallingford at short range stop  For half an hour he maintained a rapid fire until the guns smoked with heat stop  during the whole of this time the Turks were pouring across the front in dense columns attempting to attack our men occupying the farm stop  hardly a Turk got back to the hills again stop</p>
