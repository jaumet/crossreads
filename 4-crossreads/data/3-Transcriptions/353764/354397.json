<p>in another win for us.  Final Scores 20th Batt. 60 all out.  20th A.S.C. 115 all out.<br/>I carried my bat out for 5 runs, but went in 8th place so did not have much of an opportunity.<br/>Still no mail for us but we heard that there are some for us brought over by The  Omrah, but we cannot trace them.<br/>I am all alone to-night as they have all gone into Cairo.  Raining here &amp; I think it will keep it up all night.<br/>Several more Transports have arrived at Suez &amp; the Troops will be sent on here in a day or so.</p>
<p>6.2.16<br/>Sunday, usually a day of rest but for us a good hard days work.<br/>Played Cricket in the afternoon &amp; am feeling pretty crook.  Have a sore throat &amp; Head ache but am taking a stiff dose of Medicine in the morning.<br/>The 1st Coy A.A.S.C. marched in to-day from Mersa Matrua &amp; is situated alongside us.  The 2nd  Coy marches in to-morrow.  They have had a pretty strenuous time with the Bedouins &amp; have earned a good rest.</p>
