able as possible, I thoroughly enjoyed my ride through several Towns, the first I passed was Borre, then Strazeele, the Bailleau. The Roads are all cobbled made of Cobble stones splendid to ride over, I saw French Boys Girls skating on the Ice in several places, where the water holes were frozen. Borre is only a small village, but Strazeele was a fair size place, Bailleau was a large city Town is full of Australian Troops. On arrival in the Square I got off the Lorry after thanking the Driver walked along the Steinwerck Road down hill when along came an Australian Motor Lorry No 3 Division the Driver gave me a lift right into Steinwerck arriving there at 3-15 Pm. I made straight for the Motor Workshops found my Brother busy fixing up electric lights on the stage in the hall of their Recreation Room. He did not expect me although I wrote him a letter 10 days before telling him of my intended visit but he never received it. As he was very busy I sat by the Store until he finished at 5 Pm, when we went over to the Cookhouse for Tea which consisted of Bread Cheese Jam a Pot of Tea. After Tea I went back with him to the Hall as he had to finish the wiring
