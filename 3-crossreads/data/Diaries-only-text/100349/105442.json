5/7/17.
Was out all last night doing a night attack practice against the Beaumont Harnel positions, that foiled our assaults, so long last year. There are few land marks left on this landscape now. The ground is still littered with barbed wire and other material, a few skeletons lie amongst the grass and flowers, it is almost unbelievable that this bare country, called for almost superhuman effort to capture it. Returned to camp a 7.A.M. Wrote some letters home.
6/7/17.
Put the blankets in and marched from Mailly to Buire, about 9 miles. A good march, for the fellows are in much better nick now. The Battalion is growing up to strength again too many of the old hands are back again. Am in the same billet at Buire.
