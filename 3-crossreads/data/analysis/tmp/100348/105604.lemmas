 16/8 /16 . Left Contay yesterday morn and march through Albert , a pipe band of the Gordon Highland play ahead of my platoon as we march through the town . Rest some hour in the reserv line . Cold and rain . Then went over a terribl track to the front line , reach it in the daylight . Of the Pozier villag not a trace remain , and this posit on the left of the windmil overlook Courcelett , so some one has been work while we were away . There is a good deal of shell go on but happili not much come our way . I got a bit of sleep in a Hun dugout . There were some veri dead hun in it but I did not mind . They had a tunnel to a machin gun emplac thirti yard long .
