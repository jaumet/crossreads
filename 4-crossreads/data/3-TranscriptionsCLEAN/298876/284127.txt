Feel a good bit better, done my shift, although I did not feel too bright. Has left me a very heavy cold.
For the first time today we got Boat drill, we night men were rudely awakened by the steam whistle blowing - men rushing all roads to don their life belts - Drs - Sisters - Officers, etc all to their alotted places. The A.G.H. men & Doctors - also all A.M.C. men who are on Hospital duty at the time take up their positions at Hospital & also see that each patient is provided with a belt. Field Ambulance & L.H.F.A. men fall in with the Units to whom they are attached.
Saw hundreds of I think Dolphins, they seem to be identical to our Porpoises, but smaller in size, they look just like a lot of pigs frolicking in water.
Sea a bit choppy. a nice cool breeze blowing - from North Raining all the afternoon.
