 (No. 9) Troopship Kyarra Fremantle 14th December 1914 
 Dear old Mrs, I was very disappointed to find no letter or telegram from you &ndash; the Orontes is due here from Sydney to-morrow   I suppose your letters will be on board her -  I will probably not get them, as we expect to leave this afternoon   I am hoping that we will be delayed long enough to get the mail, if we are not it is possible that the Orontes might carry them on to Colombo &amp; we may get them there.   I have just sent some Xmas cards &amp; hope they will reach you all right. I invested in a bathgown today
