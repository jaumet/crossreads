December 1915Monday 6Dull. Heavy firing at Suvla Bay and Cape Helles.
Tuesday 7Fine day. Some chaps back today. Len Poupard who was badly wounded the first day has returned. Our trench works were a revelation to him as there were only bushes to be seen when we landed. The Navy is doing a tremendous amount of shooting from our waters. Received welcome letters from Matt and Clare
