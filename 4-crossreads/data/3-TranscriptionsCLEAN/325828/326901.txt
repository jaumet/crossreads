  
 Somewhere in France. 2nd April 1916 
 My dearest Father, I am writing this under a new heading   We left Egypt about a fortnight ago & had a good trip up the Mediterranean.  I saw both Walter & Ol whilst I was in Cairo prior to leaving, & among the first persons I saw on the wharf when we landed in France was Rid.  I could only spare him 5 minutes & he was looking well.  We left Alexandria on [date obliterated by censor] by the [vessel name obliterated]   We had one Submarine scare coming over when one of the transports of the convoy fired 2 shots at a box they saw floating  On the [date blanked out] we received the S. O. S message that the "Mineapolis" sent out when she was torpedoed. We put in at Toulon, & I was greatly pleased with what we saw of it from the boat.  We only stayed there 24 hours & then cast off again.  The last bit of the trip was pretty rough & nearly all of us were sick.  I thought once or twice my heart would come up.  As far as we have seen of France it is a lovely climate.  We have had a good bit of rain, but the countryside is looking perfect   Everywhere the fruit trees are out in blossom, & the fields are crowded with grasses & clover.  The people are very obliging but it is rather comical sometimes trying to make ourselves understood.
