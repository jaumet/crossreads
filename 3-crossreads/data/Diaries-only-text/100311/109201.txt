3/10/17 Ypres Anzac House
sitting a deep shell slit cut in a trench. Yarned there for a while about our charge and then moved back to Battn. H.Q. all of a muck sweat. Managed to get some sleep before dawn and got up about 10 am. The day was a busy one preparations in full swing. At 8 pm I moved off with my party for the Battle HQ's on the Lake and there saw Rodda and dear little Kell ? the later I much fear for the last time. Got everyone packed in Stewart meanwhile looking after the markers on the J.O.T. The evening was quiet but our little slit of trench was only 60 yards from the Boche post where m.g. fire was kept up all the time and frequent flares were fired. All stayed very still while the flares were up in the air and while the bullets were rattling along the parapet. A long wait in miserable cold and a little drizzle before forming up time.
