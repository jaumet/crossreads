Sunday 10th to Sunday 17thThe weather has been quite dull of late & we have had several light showers.  The days are lengthening out & getting warmer.  Work is as usual fairly slack & I get a chance to put in a bit of time learning Arabic  Take 3 lessons a week, on Monday, Wednesday & Friday nights.  It helps to put in some of the evenings.  When the nights are a bit cold I generally go round to Mrs Warners get warm by the fire & then turn in.  They only live about 2 or 300 yards from our quarters.In the afternoons Burrows of the 10th LH & myself generally go round to the British Recreation club & play billiards & read the latest papers.  At the Quarters a piano has been installed & the big hall furnished with tables & chairs
