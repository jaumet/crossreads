<p>Saturday 13th April 1917 [1918]<br/>A "down in the depth of despair" day &amp; yet suppose it is only weakness, however it gradually passes as all days do.  Wrote yesterday to Aunt Min re Uncle Alex's death, Mrs. Richardson, &amp; Mother.<br/>Rec'd letter from Sister Hughes &amp; the little thing rises higher than before in my regard for her thought was a kindly one.<br/>M.O. (Dr. Spencer) wanders in, discusses fly papers, glances at me, feels pulse, wanders out again.  Order sodii bicarb for cough.<br/>Pt. put on ordinary diet!  Had leg of fowl for 4 days previously.</p>
