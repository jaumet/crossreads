  Parcels from Dotty & Dungalear  Used a blanket for the 1st time last night- Just heard I am to leave here on Friday 25th catch Hospital Boat for England will take about a fortnight as boat very slow.  I go into a Hospital in England & get leave from there. Feeling very "bucked" about it. Send you this now as may not get chance later.  Love to all  - Snap enclosed.
