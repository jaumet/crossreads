<p>7.8.18<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>Very little news so I'm only scribbling a  P.S. I have been in to visit my Salisbury Friends 3 times since last Sunday. I went for a  [indecipherable] Tea on Wednesday last with Mrs Edmonds   &amp;   all the Girls   &amp;  rowing with Misses   [indecipherable]  on Saturday. On Monday Tommy Ellis   &amp;   I went to the Sports but did not compete  &amp; then went to a real lively musical evening at No 13, 13 people making up the party. Ellis   &amp;  I are crossing to the Island on the same date our lucky day as even  [indecipherable] todate. We went to the "Glad Eye"   &amp;  "Who's the Lady" last week but we are too busy to bother about the show this week at all. One of my English Aunts (by marriage) has just died worth many thousands. She left all but a &pound; 1000 to Uncle Tim's Step-Son. The paltry &amp;pound 1000 went to a cat  &amp;  dogs Home &amp;  Here's a poor   [indecipherable] wanting money badly. Must write to the Island tonight   &amp;  tell them when I am coming over. Love to you all  Harry</p>
