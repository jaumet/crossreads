<p>3<br/>to make ourselves fairly comfortable and should be more so as time goes on.  Probably however we will move to another camp in the early spring.</p>
<p>I am having all my letters still addressed to Bank of N.S.W. as it seems safer.  They forward them to me according to my changes of address of which I inform them.</p>
<p>I did not see or hear anything of Keith before coming away.  He is probably still in England as I don't know what great use could be found for m.m.g's in this weather out here.  I was lucky in getting a run of about 80 miles down South on Tuesday and saw some more of France but only <u>heard</u> the Somme "booming".  Have not been in any front line trenches yet and will now probably wait for another frost as the mud at present is very deep and "muddy".</p>
<p>Will stop now but hope to hear from you soon and also to have other news to write in the course of the next month or so.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; yourself.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely</p>
