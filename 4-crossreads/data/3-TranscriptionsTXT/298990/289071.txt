 Delville Wood 11/11/16 as life had flown had come hundreds of little organisms which working silently had set to work and completely eaten and destroyed all the soft parts of the body, and, their work finished, these little black maggots lay dead themselves thick all over the corpse.  There was no offensive smell and all were slowly sinking back into their Earth Mother.  Noticed a German field boot on a decaying leg and also a field grey overcoat riddled through and through.  The way the many bodies lie should say that the men were attacking and had to pass through a barrage.  They lie where they fell.  There was very heavy fighting in this same well named "Devil's Wood"!  Men live, work and have their "bivvies" in among these sights.  Very many hard at work on road scraping and construction.  Coming back we walked overland rather than by road and stood in one elevated place watching our big guns in action long tongues of flame leaping from their throats. Returned to camp and had lunch.  The Germans started a stunt pouring in shells on the right.  Our people responded.  Out of surplus rations I have accumulated plenty of tea sugar &ndash; nearly 90 lbs of sugar &#64; 6 per lb.  How the army is fed up at public expense!  A heavy fog came up about 4 pm and brought night conditions as its companion.  The temperature shows much warmer weather conditions than the last few days and although we had a roaring red coal fire in a brazier, it was left to waste its warmth outside.  Shrewdly suspect that there are some dead men a very few inches under our beds as the ground of the tent floor reeks with a putrid stench when dug up.  Turned in and went to sleep before 8 pm but was awakened by stray men stumbling tired into camp and cursing volubly &ndash; what a world of comfort the soldier finds in the letter "f" and how the sexualisation of conversation acts as his safety valve!  Comparatively quiet night.
