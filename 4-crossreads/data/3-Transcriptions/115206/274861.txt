<p>October 1918.<br/>Friday 18</p>
<p>With the forward Section, Forward Position.<br/>Barrage opened at 5.35 am, Left battery 0600, and stopped outside Molain with the forward Section. Laid a line to F.O.O. but all the work was for nothing as the Yanks did not take the advantage of the barrage, much to my disgust. Returned to our Bty at 1750 which had moved across to St Martin.<br/>Spent an eventful evening received a little mail which was very welcome and included a letter from E.A.<br/>Fritz did not do much shelling.</p>
