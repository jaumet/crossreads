 Through all (the noises of) this and through every other occurrence and happening in the vicinity  breaks the bragging of the guns; as though they are swaggering masters of the day and must punctuate each written line of time. 
 On the left of the smug old twelve inch growler there is a battery of four inch guns, then comes another similar battery and further to the left still a third battery with perhaps 'five-points-two guns. Further along beyond the gaping mine crator we know there are other batteries and then a dribble of them down the slope into the valley beyond the main road, all approximately in the same line. 
 But in the valley itself what of the guns there? We dont know the number of batteries; we dont know how many hundred guns. We have only heard of their calibres;- eights; nine-point-twos; five point twos; and sixes. Do we know anything at all? Yes! We know that is straightened into a simple line they would be wheel to wheel 
 We dont want to know more. That is enough. It is magnificent! 
 Now bring our thoughts back to the 12" grumbler with his ugly big mouth and thick lips, and consider awhile how matters may be on his right along the road which often resembles a dragon of vitality.  Batteries are near him in the blither of villiage ruin; and other batteries string out along the road-bank, over the rise, down into the gully and beyond, and goodness knows where else besides. In the gully they are in nests but number as if placed wheel to wheel. Think of it. Thank God, and praise our army
