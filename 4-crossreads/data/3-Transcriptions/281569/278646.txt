<p>March 25, 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Revielle as usual</p>
<p>Horses went out again but didn't leave to come home until late at night so as to dodge the heat of the day. I had another ride out &amp; paid a visit to the Nile, there it is very wide &amp; when I was there several felucca's came down under full sail &amp; looked real well the niggers are not too friendly in these parts for you often get a shower of anything they have to give away, Saw the natives treating the palms, they are divided into two sexes, male from female &amp; the flower of the male is treated with some substance &amp; then placed in the flower of the female &amp; this is why our palms at home never bear fruit.</p>
<p>Bed at 10.20</p>
<p>March 26, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>Hopped out at 5.15</p>
<p>Tied up &amp; groomed &amp; then led off to water, had breakfast then after cleaning camp the men had the day to themselves.</p>
<p>Pard &amp; the C.O. are leaving by the express tonight for Cairo, where they intend to stay several days, the Sig Squadron is the attraction or rather the unravelling of same but I don't give him a chance.</p>
<p>The Secret service reports that everything is clear for 200 miles so I can't see any fun here, a squadron flew out to &amp;  over the Sennussi camp at Sodum where they heavily bombed it causing intense panic amongst the enemy.</p>
<p>Wrote letters home &amp; Neil, Hal &amp; Chas went on leave &amp; Norm &amp; I went for a ride after tea on the bikes leaving them at the station for they are going with the boys.</p>
<p>Turned in at 10.10</p>
