  
  Save your money  
 8 When tempted with a sandy thirst 7 When the risk in the deserts done 8 Just slake your thirst with water A can of boys beer's piastre one Save your Money. 
 When eating stew for seven days Multiplied by seven without end, And you feel you'd like something solid boys 
 Just buckle your belt to the end. Save your money
