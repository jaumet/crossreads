The flour looked allright, quite as white as any other I had seen. We went on to the next village, Domqueur and then returned home.<br/>To give some idea of the rations we were on at that time &ndash; these were the daily rations for four days<br/>10 April -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 men to 1 loaf-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 biscuit each<br/>11   "   -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "  1   "  -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3   "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "<br/>12   "   -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4   "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "   1   "-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 1&frasl;2   "<br/>13   "   -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 1&frasl;2 Biscuits each.<br/>After this, the rations commenced improving.<br/>On 20 April we went for a walk to Ailly le Haut Clocher mainly to see what we could get to eat. We did not get anything however, as they were short of bread. I got a big bundle of mail from Aussie that night.<br/>On 21 April</p>
