<p>erected a shelter from light rain and wind.<br/>During action it was very marked the aeroplane activity and yesterday one came down quite close to the dugout.  The bombers were also busy today and it was rather risky as we could hear pieces whizzing at a terrific rate.<br/>But the best sight was at night.  The artillery began a bombardment and with numerous star shells &ndash; the whole made a good picture.  The weather during the week had been exceptionally good during the week for this time of year.<br/>Dave Cunningham &amp; Ted Stewart brought out some supplies tonight (No. 9 Camp they are in).</p>

Going some all time.<br/>Moved off at 9 a.m. and arrived back at Camp about 10.15.<br/>Bath was first consideration.  Rec'd books from Joe Slater.
