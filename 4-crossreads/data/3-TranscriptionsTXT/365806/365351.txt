4Wagga this time.  Do you remember Maj. Edwards being hopelessly out of direction when we were up there?  Did you see the butter-factory this time?  If I remember rightly it was a German who owned it.
I am going to France to-night with another draft, so will have to stop now.  This is only an excuse, because I have no news & my pen is running out.
Please remember me to Mr. O'Reilly.
Your loving sonKeith
