<p>Tell Mr Waugh I always think of the good teaching he gave me when a boy, &amp; it makes everything quite easy &amp; I am not a bit afraid if the end did happen to come. which is not at all likely.<br/>Also tell the Doctor that I often think of the way he used to say he would carve into any German patients, &amp; wish he had started years ago.<br/>At the present moment our ships &amp; guns are giving about the biggest bombardment since we came. I tell you the shells play the dickens. I am glad they are not coming at us. The rumbling noise has not ceased for a second for over an hour. You know some of the shells weigh a ton. How about one of them for dinner. No good Eh so say I.<br/>Well I will be glad when it is all over and I am back with my dear Mother &amp; Father &amp; Sister again. I am sure I will not leave you again. Father &amp; I will have some days out &amp; Mother &amp; Doss theatre nights. I am going to have a good quite time for a month or two when I come back. I do hope I get to England to see Aunt Florrie. I get such nice letters from her, &amp; she says she is very proud of me.<br/>I can tell you the man who sticks this &amp; sees it through is good material &amp; good "breed"<br/>I am made Sergeant. Not bad. I am the first Corporal in our company to be gazetted on the field.<br/>Hoping you are all well &amp; to hear from you tomorrow<br/>Best love &amp; good wishes<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom</p>
