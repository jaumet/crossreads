February 1915Saturday 13About 4 oclock this morning we were attacked by the 4th Batt as enemy. After exchanging shots with a small party of the enemy, we retired on the [indecipherable] position. The enemy were now advancing in numbers up the slope, but with the fire from our position & the raking enfilade fire of the platoons entrenched on the opposite side of the waddy we repulsed them with great loss.About day break the enemy was seen retreating in good orders. We had stew for breakfast. Then marched away. Had a couple of hours spell & did a magnificent charge against the fourth who were entrenched in front of us & to right & left of us.Marched back to camp had a good wash. Holiday for rest of day
Sunday 14Had a good nights rest last night. Slept like a king. There was no dew owing to a slight breeze which was blowing. The breeze was chilly. Grand weather all day. The lads held a bit of a concert about 8.30. I think to learn some new songs for the march. Tea and one biscuit per man was issued at 9.15 P.M. Did a 10 mile march. The night was dark but warm. Two more deaths this week in our Batt.
