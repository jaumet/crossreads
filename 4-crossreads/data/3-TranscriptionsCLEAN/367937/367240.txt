29th July 1916
My dear Hal and Freddie
Got your letters of 22nd June to day also from Mother & Father of that date.What a time you kids must have had at mid-winter with the car: Guess we will shake things up when I get home eh what!  Toot Toot !!! There is a letter for me from home written about 16th June which I have not yet got but expect it in a day or two as the week after one often comes a couple of days before the week before one: if you can understand - It will be the description of taking delivery of the car.  People round home must be pretty brave when they'll go to a meeting where you Fred & young Coleman play the hymns - Think it would drive me to drink!  We all thought last Monday that we were off to the Regiment; however we have not gone yet and dont seem to be going for some time so I have volunteered for the machine gun squadron & expect we will be sent to a school.  Don't know what we will be attached to. Might just stop with our regiment any how my address is the same.I have no Brigade number till attached to the Regt then if I am still 1st Reg I'll be first 1st Brigade also at present I'm just 1st Training Regt.  Will have some photos to send next week but they are not good ones I'm afraid.  Am on guard all to night & tomorrow. Dash. Love to Aunt KatieYour loving brotherRob.
P.S.Going to Regt tomorrow (31st July) in Machine Gun Squadron.Rob
