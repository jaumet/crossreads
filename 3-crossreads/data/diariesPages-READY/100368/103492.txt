Dec 23rd Thursday
A large mail received by our unit. Received two parcels and newspapers and letters from home. They were all very acceptable at this time. No bread for tea, so that the contents of the parcels came in very handy. The large ship "Aquatania" which is now a hospital ship has arrived in the harbour. It is the largest ship in the world at present. The sunsets are beautiful here.
