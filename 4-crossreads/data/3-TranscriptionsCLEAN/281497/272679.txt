  
 9th. This morning we packed up & moved off from Halloy-Pernois toward the firing line, it was a scorching hot morning, & the dust was something awful far worse than the marching which was quite stiff enough for anyone. 
 We passed a lot of our artillery, & the 5th Brigade on the way back they did not get the cutting up we did, we had a good long spell on the grass while the Artillery passed us. 
 We are now in billets about 6 miles from Halloy. 
 Received quite a budget of letters yesterday, & Gretas photo among them how she has changed.
