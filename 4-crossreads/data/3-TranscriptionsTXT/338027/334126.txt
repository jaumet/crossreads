 Thursday, 28 January, 1915 In the morning our advance guard and the transports left for Zeitoun.  The drivers will return to-morrow.  All of us have to leave Maadi by Saturday.  The reinforcements for the 1st contingent and the motor transport have reported at Alexandria.  The second contingent must be very close to Egypt now, judging by Melb newspapers we have seen, they have been playing up and it was a good thing when they sailed.  The first contingent I think can hold their own with the 2nd. 
 Friday, 29 January, 1915 Men arrived home with transports from Zeitoun and report it a splendid camp superior to Maadi.  One of our corporals went to Alexandria to-day to bring back six men as our reinforcements.  1000 of them have arrived at Alexandria.  After two men that were killed in the skirmish at Kantara on the canal were buried at Port Said to-day we had a half holiday to day to pack our kits etc. and they were all put on the waggons in readiness to start off to-morrow morning.  Reveille will be at 5 a.m.
