21st. The old frost still holds with iron hands on the land, ice is 12 inches thick the whole countryside has the appearance of being under a heavy fall of snow, a thick haze hangs over all the cold is intense, chills right to the marrow bones. Food is not too plentiful but we just about get enough for breakfast, we have a bowl of tea, porridge, 2 small slices of bread, a little slice of bacon or ham, for dinner we have a bowl of tea plate of stew or currie, a couple of slices of bread, tea consists of the usual bowl of tea 2 slices of bread sometimes meat, a little jam cheese, for supper we have biscuits cocoa, rice is served every other night for tea, so you can see we don't live like fighting cocks but the food is plain well cooked
