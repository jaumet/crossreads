  
 October 1918. Saturday 5 
 In read of Johncourt. Bty Position. Stunt opened at 5/15 am, advance of 1500 yds. 2nd Div pioneers hopped the bags captured a few hundred prisoners.  A wild rumor started to the effect that we are going out of action for a spell. As usual turned out to be that we are not going out but going up farther forward to a new position near Ramicourt. After all we did not move today either forward or back. Jocks have been burying their dead all day.
