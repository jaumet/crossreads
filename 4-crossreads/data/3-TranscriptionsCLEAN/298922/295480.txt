Wednesday 13 June 1917
Last night a terrific bombardment went on on our left. The SKY was bright with Flares & SHELLS bursting - result an important forward position of Johnnie Turkstaken.
"Camels" had a day's sports & Carnival & Concert in the evening. I went & saw Nowell, he's a great man among the English Aristocracy now - LORDS & ragged EARLS, etc:  One item a Musical Chairs by mounted Camels was screamingly funny - Camels are riden in a circle, bags on ground at intervals, on the Band stopping, Camels are made to sit on nearest bag.
[The following paragraph crossed through.]  BEER night again & many have yet to learn "How much they can carry". Broken noses & more SKIN off the result.
