I can't settle down to read or even write like I used to be able at one time just at present I have a severe attack of homesickness, but whats the use of that in the military, all the longing you might have in the world is of no avail, so you just have to grin bear it, if I were only free I should pack up get for my life back once again to the Sunny South if only for a few days, I'm certain that would be a certain rapid cure for our restlessness, all the boys are feeling the same way, we almost have to force ourselves to write now, everything military is getting hateful to us all, people in Australia or England don't long for this war to finish any more than we do I'll bet, as the days go past we hate it more more.
28th. Had a day off today Jock Depina took the fatigue party out, Hayes I went over to the wood to see if we could shoot
