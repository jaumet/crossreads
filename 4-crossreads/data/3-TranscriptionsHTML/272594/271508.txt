<p>&amp; wheeling about.</p>
<p>Last night some of the 5th Bde machine gunners brought a big heavy machine down, he was very cheeky &amp; came down too low with disastrous results.</p>
<p>There has been some very heavy fighting around Bullecourt, the Tommies got through all right but failed to hold it, the result is that they have left the Australians in a very nasty position &amp; both our flanks are in the air &amp; that means enfilading fire the worst of all to stand up to &amp; tonight</p>
