26 May 1916 FriHerbie is now two days overdue from London. Spent most of the day getting the tent in order later on adjourned to Steenwerck visiting our friends & also several new chaps belonging to the Cameron Highlanders. Bill Buck comes home well oiled.
27 May 1916 SatB-Section plays A Section football. A certain amount of jealousy exists between the two Sections & it looks on paper as if A Section will win. Surgeon General Portus visits our station & is highly pleased with the way everything is going on. Football postponed till tomorrow on account of his visit. Went to Steenwerck again to-night with Marsh
[Text continued in margin] & Keith. Marsh tanked up & gets lost among the incinerators.
