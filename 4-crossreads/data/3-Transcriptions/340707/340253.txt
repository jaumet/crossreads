<p>127<br/>As ruins they possess no interest though guardian thinks different but the view of the valley especially in the sunshine to day with its squares &amp; patches is well worth the climb. See pc for view.</p>
<p>We descend the chateau by a steep private path used by inmates when during [indecipherable] visited here &amp; in a few minutes are in the town.</p>
<p>We then take the high for Dampierre &amp; the road passes several times a thicket in which the grand trees make a rustic alley though one side is hidden by a high stone wall &amp; one knows that some rich noble has his home behind it. One is hidden by wall but when one comes to the chateau itself the wall ceases &amp; a deep ditch takes its place &amp; a view of grounds &amp; cheateau is possible &amp; it is is nothing exceptional so why the enormous 16 ft wall.</p>
<p>At Dampierre is Chauteau of Lugnes family but we do not enter as family is in residence (but see pc). The road is hot &amp; uninteresting now. Brise finds some apples but they are sour &amp; afterwards some pears. Road has no shelter.</p>
<p>Senlisse lies to left of hills and so path leads on till we arrive at the Vaux</p>
