<p>Fine. Had lunch early and M<sup>rs</sup>&nbsp;Lloyd, Jo, Linda &amp; Self got a car and went out to Cronulla for day. Had afternoon tea at the Hotel &amp; drove up to the Entrance to Port Hacking &nbsp;My word things have changed wonderfully down there lately. Its quite a town where a few years ago was only scrub. Saw Jessie for a few minutes. Got back in time for late tea, and got back to camp at night.</p>
