 Fine with a very heavy fog the heaviest I have ever seen. If you were walking along the centre of the road you could not see anybody on the side. About stables ect in morning & we had a gas lecture & practice in putting on gas helmets. Took the horses out for exercise by Stonehenge in afternoon & I went on divisional forage picket at 4.30 pm.
