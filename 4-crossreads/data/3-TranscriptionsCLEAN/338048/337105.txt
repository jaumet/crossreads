coves produced a great scene. Then we moved from there (this is during the shunting) we passed over a huge bridge built high over houses some three stories packed very tight and looking very compact. A narrow but very clean & white road running between the houses & another bridge high up a little further along and gardens etc away below you provided a wonderful scene. I cannot describe it but the train running though an avenue of big bushy trees vivid green colour grass & hedges skirting the track left me pretty well in raptures over the sight. Look to your left you see the grim dockyard, look to your right you see the vivid greeness of trees & lovely undulating hills; All this after 9.45 pm. You could read until 10 pm. but as soon as we proceeded towards Amesbury it became too dark but the view of another big high bridge over a cove & skirting the waters edge at another cove only made us annoyed that darkness prevented us from seeing this beautiful Cornwall Devon & Dorset scenery. And so in the darkness we thundered on at a great rate drawn by 2 engines towards our training ground.
We had 3rd class carriages and officers first. Carriages were very comfortable and there was a map in each compartment a thing for which we all had more or less (most more) longed for during the voyage.
