<p>Dear Mr. Layton<br/>We are sending Mrs. Tallehawk for a little immediate assistance. Her husband Archibald James Tallehawk enlisted under the name of Hamilton 198 [indecipherable] Co 30th Battalion but is supposed to have deserted &amp; gone with 4th R. 20th B.</p>
<p>Pending enquiries by the military authorities she is receiving no pay at all</p>
<p>We think you may be willing to assist</p>
<p>Yours faithfully<br/>B. Booth</p>
