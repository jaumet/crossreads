<p>Dear Mother &amp; Father<br/>Have reached another stage. We are now at Haure. Have got absolutely nothing to do here and time hangs very heavily. The weather is oppressively hot and I feel inclined to do nothing but sleep all day long.</p>
<p>We leave here for England on Tuesday 13th but am afraid that from all accounts we shall be hung up for a good while in England. I shall let you know when I am likely to embark.</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Your aftt Son<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
