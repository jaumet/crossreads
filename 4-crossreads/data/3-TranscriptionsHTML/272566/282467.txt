<p>Wednesday 24 January</p>
<p>Off duty all the morning.  At midday the R.A.P. parties, which included our squad, moved off to the line, having got our feet washed with the new "trench foot" preparation on the way out.  Our squad were some time in finding our post, after wandering dangerously near the firing line.  I don't think <strike>think</strike> we will go for any more walks in that direction.  Finally stationed in Windmill trench (practically the same as Needle Trench) quite close to where we were when last in action here, but this time we have a deep dug-out after the style of the Germans.  Les Boeufs lies a little to our right.  We were doomed to a rush of patients as soon as we took over.</p>
