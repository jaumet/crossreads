<p>169<br/>angry men are hard to pacify.</p>
<p>There was one young fellow killed as the result of the operations of the covering party. His name was Irwin. He had only been with the Battn for a couple of months. We had dug in very close to the Bluff and I suppose the Germans thought us very presumptuous for doing so. Anyway we had only been established for a very short time when the sentry on guard noticed the Germans coming through the Barded wire and making for our trench.</p>
<p>He fired off his gun and attracted the attention of the other men.</p>
<p>We all stood too and prepared to defend our position</p>
