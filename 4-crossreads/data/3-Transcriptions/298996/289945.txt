Nice little scene this afternoon. One of our Destroyer was throwing a few pills over at the Turks trenches which the Turks did not appreciate whosever one of our gun retured complement which went very close needless to say our helpmates went of the mark at a great pace. 7 Brigade officers having a 'good look around' up here this afternoon things look as though we will be relieved at last whitin the next couple of day.
