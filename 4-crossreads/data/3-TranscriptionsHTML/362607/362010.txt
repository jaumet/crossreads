<p>Bulford<br/>16.2.18<br/>Dear Mum,<br/>Just a few lines while I have the chance. I expect Norm Keirle over tomorrow &amp; I may not get the chance. I am Relieving the Night Corporal so that he may go to the theatre. I have had another busy week. I went to the theatre 3 times. I saw Sir Frank &amp; Lady Benson in "the Taming of the Shrew", "The Merry Wives of Windsor" &amp; "The Merchant of Venice. They were fine &amp; the latter in particular. Ellis, Dave Williams &amp; myself went to the latter together. I went over to Hudscott on Thursday on Duty. I had to take a chap over there to be boarded for Aussie. Strange to say he was the S/Sgt. Major Imperial Man, who first gave me "Pick 'Im up" in Warwick Farm. I met Reg. Keirle &amp; we had supper together &amp; a long yarn. It was a 4 mile walk back to the Station so I would not venture. I met a chap that was at the Ball in Salisbury &amp; he fixed me up with a lovely meal. Then I got myself sleeping quarters &amp; a bed &amp; blankets. Of course we all talked about Aussie &amp; where we would like to be. One chap wanted Burwood.  See No 2    Harry</p>
