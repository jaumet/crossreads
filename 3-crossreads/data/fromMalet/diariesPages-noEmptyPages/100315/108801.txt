20/4/18 - Lavieville
Went round all the companies and gave them jobs in the way of digging a connected line of trench and linking up our position. A Hun plane was over being futilely blazed at. Went up and saw Sparrow and put the acid on him for several things. The Boche was putting over heavy salvoes of 4.2's on top of the trenches round the forward Bn. H.Q. The air was rather full of splinters and not too healthy. Came back to our cellar at about 3.00 and had some lunch. The Padre blew along to say of a prayer over a better man than he is.
