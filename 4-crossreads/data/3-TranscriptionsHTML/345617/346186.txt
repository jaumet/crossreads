<p>Septembre 21<br/>Things are much more quiet today. There is great activity consolidating new lines of communication &amp; a great many Batteries are being shifted up into new positions. It is reported that here are 1000 dead Germans at least on our front in one Brigade area.</p>
<p>Septembre 22<br/>Coy are shifting closer up to the new lines - taking up H.Q. at Zillebeke Lake. I have a party employed making hot food containers. Fritz made another counter attack this morning but was beaten off again. Sgt Baldwin &amp; Cpl Hamilton both of the 1st F. Coy &amp; original men have been killed. I think it was this morning. Sgt Baldwin was a particular friend of mine.</p>
