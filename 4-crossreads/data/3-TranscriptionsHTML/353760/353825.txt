<p>January 22<br/>110.<br/>Mail yesterday brought report from T.B.C. of 1st edit. of Burke's Limehouse Nights, wrote for it, and an hour later declining it, a dozen times I've decided for and against:  the price though is really too high.  But Twinkletoes was a fine and richly written book.  Limehouse Nights was the first of the Limehouse sketches, I'll for it!  Will write after receiving of T.L.S. today.</p>
<p>111.<br/>Last night with Frank K. and Bill F. to Kookaburras:  a special programme there being amongst the audience a live and tame general and his staff, and recognised an old enemy amongst that most brilliantly band'ed staff, a Maj. who at Ribemont in Nov. '16 put Clarrie and self out of one of the A.D.M.'s lorries when we were travelling down to Buire to join up the unit.</p>
<p>112.<br/>Today a grey mild day as yesterday, rain clouds low in the sky and each morning lovely colourings about the hills before the sun.</p>
<p>Read last night Masefield's sonnet "Roses are Beauty".</p>

<p>114.<br/>It was Henderson of Charing Cross Road who first shewed me Pearse's Collected Works Volume and who recommended me to read it &ndash; he first told me of Pearse being of the Easter Risings victims, now in the Jan. 17, T.L.S. appears &ndash;</p>

<p>January 23<br/>115.<br/>Posted today letter of Mon. 26, asking for a couple of Venus Pencils:  one I'm using so used down that even with holder it's difficult to work with:  last night sketched in "Fairies &amp; Fusiliers" below "I wonder what it feels like to be Drowned":  roughed out another</p>
