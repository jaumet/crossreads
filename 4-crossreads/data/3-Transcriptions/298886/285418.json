<p>The Brigade Head Qrtrs signal station is located on top of one of the flat topped buildings in the Town about 8 miles away from where we are One Squadron has gone about 10 miles up the Canal and the other one has gone a corresponding distance down stream. Up to now we are the only ones in communication. I have to go out on a long ride tomorrow to see how things are going with the other two posts.</p>
<p>The barking of the native's dogs and the Arab yelling &amp; shouting can be heard for miles around.</p>
