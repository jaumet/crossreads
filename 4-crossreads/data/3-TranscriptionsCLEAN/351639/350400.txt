Dated 1 Sept. 1915. 318 words][Continuation of Ashmead Bartlet's report on the combined British/Anzac operations at Suvla Bay and Lone Pine, 6th to 10th August]Daily Telegraph  London  R.T.P.Cable five section six stop   from Anzac Cove the hills culminating in Koja Chemen Tepe take a general direction north east leaving an ever widening gap of flat ground between them and the sea shore which stretches northwards to Anafarta Bay stop  along this flat ground the Australians have a line of outposts the most advanced of which was when the movement commenced was No 2 Post just beyond the point known as Fisherman's hut all connected by a wide sap as by daylight it is impossible to cross the flat ground in the open as the enemy holds all the positions on the hills above stop   now all the troops stores ammunition destined for the attack on the Sari Bahr position had during the days to be passed out to No 2 Post along this sap or else along the beach under cover of darkness stop
millions of rounds of ammunition and thousands of shells were successfully concentrated at the advance posts without the enemy becoming aware of the movement neither did he know of the strong reinforcements which had reached the Australian Corps stop   all this required the utmost skill and was successfully kept a profound secret stop  the troops had therefore to leave the Anzac position in narrow columns and pass along the sap or the beach after dark and then having passed the outposts to deploy over a wide front facing the various spurs and deep ravines which give access to the Sari Bahr position stop  but before this could be attacked a number of outlying posts held by the enemy old No 3 Post Bauchop's Hill Big Table Top and Little Table Top had first to be taken and held stop  all this meant a preliminary move due north over broken ground in total darkness and then a wheel due east to assault the main ridge
