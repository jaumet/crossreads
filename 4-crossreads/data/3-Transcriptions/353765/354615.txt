<p>July 1916<br/>[Note in margin:] Tuesday<br/>25th &ndash; Our machines do not seem too keen on duels. May not be so but looks like it.<br/>26th &ndash; Official infmtnn &amp; orders received re message from Taube. Red Crosses all over now. May be bluff &amp; may not. Just as well to be prepared. Regts went out last night returning tonight. Reports say that four of our men at No 2 Outpost captured. Aeroplanes scarce, not even our own. Got photos that Edward <indecipherable> took away. Thankful to get them. Thought I had lost them. 1st L.H. B went out at fast pace in evening. An S.M. reported Turks within five mile. False report.<br/>27th &ndash; Rode over to Railhead re drugs etc. Sent them up on a sandcart. Rode over in shorts &amp; got sunburnt. Taube over in morning. Good shooting by a Mtn Gun. Just under 'plane. Regts going out again. Report of Zeppo having been seen. Fun over Cold-foots<br/>28th &ndash; Regts at it all day. Incessant light fighting twist. Qatia &amp; Oghratina. Our chaps retiring trying to draw Abdul on. Turks advancing slowly digging in as he does. Dressing stn evactuates Qatia. Our casuals very light. 3 or 4 NZ's killed about 4 of ours &amp; the NZs wounded slightly. Believe our artillery tickled Abdul up. Good shooting. Wounded sent thro us. Orders rec'd about 10.30 am pack up, ready to go at very short notice. 1st <indecipherable> a week ago, second today. As usual, no sooner packed than everything wanted. Regts returned at night being relieved by 1st Bde. Dead NZ brought in on sand-cart. Dental unit (attached) imshied to Kantara.<br/>29th &ndash; Lieut Pearce 6th L.H. killed while at listening post.
