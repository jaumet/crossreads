<p>Thursday 24th<br/>At 6 am a bathing party went to the pier  -  This was my only trip to-day  -  I remained on board &amp; put in my time writing &amp; reading  -  I have ascertained from the PM (Provost Marshall) that McGuire of the Medical Army Corps is PMO  -  He's temporary probably but at any rate there's no opening for me  -</p>
<p>Nothing doing &amp; no news worth recording  -  A destroyer (Warrego) swept round our counter at sunset  -  What wicked little black hornets they look &amp; are  -  Their black color &ndash; 2 stunted funnels well forward  -  They look to be dragging a long black body behind them  -  Amid ships is a torpedo &ndash; forward is a four inch gun  -  They can steam some 27 knots an hour &amp; look like black snakes on the horizon &ndash; breathing smoke &amp; threatening destruction  -</p>
<p>I mentioned we got a fresh prize &ndash; found up a creek &amp; all covered up with green boughs &ndash; a fine little steamer  -  We got her niggers  to-day &amp; coaled &amp; then they cleaned our paint &amp; holystoned</p>
