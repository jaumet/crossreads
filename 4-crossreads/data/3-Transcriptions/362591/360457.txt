<p>My dear Judge Fergusson</p>
<p>Yrs I received today dated 10 Ap.  I am sending you a cable this evg. advising you that our Bn. is still in tact, &amp; has not up to the present been drawn upon for filling up new units, for this I am very glad as it is a bit demoralising, to get everything in going order &amp; then break up the happy home.  The Adj. has sent you the Nom. Roll so that I hope you will have it before this reaches you.  We heard only today that there were 22 cases of goods for the 20th at our transport lines, which will be brought up to us tomorrow night.  We shd. have a good many more to follow as we have not had any since we were at Kinambla [Kanimbla] Valley &amp; we are very thankful for these.</p>
