<p>The latest rumour is that there is every possibility of having a "go" at these Senussi or Bedouin Arabs or who'ever they are. I hope it is soon its all good experience. We are well versed in modern trench warfare. Now let us have a go at the mounted work. "Ready aye Ready" is our watchword. I am having the tent to myself tonight the saddler Sergeant and the Trumpeter sergt and the Armourer sergt have gone out into town. By the way the Trumpeter sergeant has not left any of the trumpeters in Camp to sound the Calls and the powers that be are making diligent enquiries "Why"?  The sergeant Trumpeter will have to answer to these things tomorrow. "Duty first"!</p>
