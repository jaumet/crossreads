 
a nutshell was the degradation of a Coy Sgt Major who was tried by CM for drunkenness & found guilty the Prisoner was then marched into the square & after the charge was read out. together with the finding of the court, a Sergeant detailed for the job stepped up & tore the crown from his sleeve. He was then marched off as a driver. This harshness had its effect as will be seen, although the minds of 90% were already made up. Following the scene we were all told to stand fast & record our votes for Conscription. Everyone looked at his neighbour & it would not have taken much brains to have read every fellows decision. They then started the polling & let me state that through the usual officers red tape, we were kept on parade in torrents of rain & a bitterly cold wind for 5 hours to record our vote, what is only natural for the result of same to be. In speaking of it afterwards we found that 90% voted NO & in the first Division the No`s had 99%. But this was only the start of the days happenings. At tea time we were all warned that the Germans were preparing a gas attack & consequently we had to lay down fully dressed with our helmets ready what a night – I never slept a wink & the cold was cruel.

The threatened attack never came off although the firing was violent & in the morning I awoke to see the whitest frost it has been my lot to gaze on & the pains of my hands & feet was well nigh unbearable. The violent firing still continues . Another 14th Coy. Sgt joined this Coy today (Sgt Hallett)
