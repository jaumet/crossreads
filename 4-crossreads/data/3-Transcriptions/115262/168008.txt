<p>Wednesday 29 August 1917.</p>
<p>Very little doing today.</p>
<p>3 Taubes shelled in vicinity of Sheikh Nuran.</p>
<p>Heard mail closed today or rather last night; &amp; from all reports all letters written between 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;June &amp; 22<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;July never reached Australia therefore up to this date in Austlia they have have received no word by letter of our arrival.</p>
<p>Anxiously awaiting our mail which we cannot get until relieved.</p>
<p>Living in hopes that those mails were not lost at sea. General disheartening regarding this.</p>
