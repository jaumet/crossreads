<p>arranged for me to visit a secondary school some day, &amp; on a third occasion to go on to the University.  The time to be at my convenience.</p>
<p>The Continental hotel for luncheon.  Met Mrs. Teddy (Dr.) Stokes &amp; eat at the same table with her.  Mrs. Newmarch was not about.</p>
<p>Met Jerrom again.  We went to the Christian brothers school, in a street off the Moushkie, and stayed for a little promising to come again, &amp; then to address the boys.</p>
<p>A trip through the Manufacturing part of the City around the Moushkie was full of interest.  All the work is done by the natives with their hands.  Brass work. Furniture. Enamelling. inlaid ivory &amp; pearl.  Much of the most beautiful.  Did I buy anything?  No.  The good stuff was to expensive.  Did I wish to purchase?  Yes, and were my funds ample enough nothing had pleased me better than to send some specimens on to you.  The will is with me the money absent.</p>
<p>Cannot now be help.  My opportunities in life for becoming rich, &amp; there were many crossed my path, have been missed.  To them Amen.  Please send this letter on to Mollie.  Adieu.  Heaps of love &amp; loads of kisses.</p>
