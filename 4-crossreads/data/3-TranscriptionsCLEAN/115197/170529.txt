 a short route march returning to the ship at 11 a.m. 
 At mid-day the "Rio Pardo" is towed into "Table Bay", and then we commence in earnest the last stage of our voyage to Australia.  Table Mountain & Lion's Head seen for the last time as our vessel draws away from land are indelibly printed in my mind. 
 Farewell "S.A."!
