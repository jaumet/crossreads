My dearest Irene,Was delighted to receive a letter from you dated 12th June. & to note that you are gradually getting well.Thank you for posting on the letters I sent. - I was paraded before the Brigadier-General commanding Brigade & recommended for a Commission, & he has sent on the papers - which is tantamount to confirming it. As soon as it is confirmed will send you a cable. - Mary Stobo is always sending me parcels & has been so good that I am glad you try to be charitable. Please God if I receive the commission I will make good old girl. - Am sure you must miss Will terribly & will be glad when he is able to go home again. Margaret's was a dear little letter. How she is improving old girl. Am very sorry to hear that the Doctor & Mrs Read have been ill & I do trustAm very glad early closing of Hotels is passed.No more news old girl.Very much love to you allAlways your loving brother,Fred.
