<p>16 February, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>It was fine to day after the rain, the air has a bit of nip about it. It was the usual mounted parade this morning but this evening we did some dismounted work, Gaurds &amp; pickquets was the order of the day but we did not get much instruction &ndash; The Brigade Major came along &amp; gave us a bit of a lecture &amp; he tried to be funny &amp; managed to keep us laughing most of the time he was speaking to us, I think though that he might just as well held his peace for all the benefit we got from his remarks &ndash; Mc[Kenzie] our troop leader was glad when he finished up to for the major addressed himself to Mac all the time, &amp; Mac was wondering whether he was joking or meant it half the time.</p>
<p>Mullins came down this evening &amp; we took a walk around Maadi. What a quiet little place it is. Pretty in its way with its long avenues of trees &amp; its houses with their nice fresh gardens about them. A Squadron has challenged B sq to a game of foot ball. I went out &amp; had a bit of a run with them this evening. Bill says we will get well slopped</p>
