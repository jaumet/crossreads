<p>6 miles away from us but I have not yet had a chance of going to see if I know anyone there.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear that Keith was still in England when you wrote &amp; hope he will remain there some time, though no doubt he is as keen as mustard to come across.</p>
<p>I hope as you say that Caesar will get (or has got) his well earned furlough. His good work, though only what one would expect, is nevertheless good to hear of.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that Dorothy had been having such a bad time. Teeth troubles are undoubtedly amongst the most wearing. My mother, in a letter dated Dec 20, said that the torturing tooth had been removed, so I hope that meant she was soon better. I hope to hear from her before long.</p>
<p>For a fortnight now we have had a hard frost with temperatures as low as 5&deg; Fahr. Ground frozen as hard as iron &ndash; instead of Flanders mud. Snow all over the countryside &amp; bright sunshine produce a mist &amp; a glare that made our work almost impossible. When the thaw does come the place will be almost flooded &amp; the mud will be 'wonderful to behold'.</p>
<p>By the way has Keith a London address?</p>
<p>Kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy &amp; yourself</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely</p>
<p>L.O'G Whitfeld.</p>
