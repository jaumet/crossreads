August
Guns & Prisoners are not yet counted. This offensive is Albert on the Somme section of the Front.
Until the 14th of August every bit of news was most satisfactory to us, According to the newspapers we have had one or two more successes on the Somme.
During the last 10 days we have had more news of the success of both the British, French and American troops, By all accounts we are keeping Fritz very busy. The tone of the papers seem to say that this is the end, And indeed everything looks that way too. The German civilians are getting very downhearted and are in doubt about winning. I try to cheer them up a bit by telling them that they wont have much time to learn English before the English come and conquer their country. They are also always complaining about the price and scarcity of all foodstuffs.
