<p>we eventually arrived at what is known as The Green Dump.  Here we were still something like four miles from the actual firing line.  The Green Dump was just a number of more or less destroyed dug-outs on the sloping side of a hill, &amp; the surrounding batterys, stores, &amp; railway line made it a much desired target for Fritz, &amp; as a consequence a rather unhealthy situation for a residence.  It was here our ambulance lost several of its men in killed &amp; wounded.  This was our return station after each stretch of 48 hrs. in the line, &amp; where we returned for the intervening 24 hrs. for a sleep &amp; brush-up.</p>
