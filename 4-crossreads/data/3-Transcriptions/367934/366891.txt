<p>Engineers Camp<br/>Enoggera<br/>Oct. 29th 1916</p>
<p>To the Trustees of the Brisbane Museum</p>
<p>Dear Sirs</p>
<p>Prior to my departure for the front I should like to present my valuable and exceedingly rare collection of cheque Harris Tweed clothes to the Brisbane Museum.</p>
<p>I realise that it is only a question of time when "Round the World with a Pencil" and The bob portrait business will belong to the past, and the necessary "clobber" a rarity which well deserves being stuffed and shown in a glass case to your good natured and much caricatured public.</p>
<p>Believe me<br/>Yours truly<br/>Sapper Vasco<br/>late of the "S.S. Koopa"</p>
