Febuary 1917.1st   There has been a succession of heavy barrages by our own artillery during the last two days, & it has been rumoured that there have been a few raids made by the 5th Division in which numerous prisoners were taken.We have had more snow to-day although very light.  Last night Fritz sent over some big shells into Albert & at about 8 o'clock one landed on the road in front of the hospital, killing about 4 horses & wounding two of the Army medical men.
