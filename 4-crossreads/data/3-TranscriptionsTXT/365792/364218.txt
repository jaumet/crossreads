May 14 of 53 on the Bols table. Not bad for a little un. Fairly decent town this Boulogne despite its cobbles & its narrow winding streets Market day in the Square is rather a busy day, war or no war, & of course all the selling is done by women or old men. The G.P.O & the Cathedral are both fine buildings, the former being right down near the Quay; But strange to say it only appears to have one entrance & exit, IE. through a large swing-door.  Many of the shop windows are tastefully dressed, but I haven't noticed any English business places. The one everlasting complaint from our boys is, "what a rotten climate" & they are all longing to get back to Sunny Australia, & the free open spaces - And being imprisoned in this Camp for 20 hrs out of the 24 is literally killing us. Why in Egypt we could do what we darned well liked the greater part of[in margin] Sunday
