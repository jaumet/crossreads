 1916   FRIDAY 8   SEPT. 
 Fine & warm. I went up to the dentist at Larkhill No 10 camp in morning to get a tooth stopped. It turned out the dentist (Lieut Tonkin I think) came home on the same boat as mother & father a few years ago. Poss Nivison arrived & was put into the 27 th  Battery. He & I went to the pictures at night but they were not much good. Warren Hogarth saw Campbell about his transfer & Campbell nearly went mad. He said he was going to get him back at all costs.
