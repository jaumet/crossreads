My dear Mother
Its quite a novelty to sit down & write a letter in a dugout again, it reminds me of good old times. I'm writing this simply & solely to acknowledge receipt of articles enumbered in rear of the left flank of this paper, & to express my appreciation of them, & not to take the place of next mail's letter.
We're having quite a glorious time, if it wasn't for the careless way in which the German throw things all over the landscape it would be perfect. What I'm going to tell you now, I actually saw & heard. There was a small group of men standing together when an enemy missile came & buried two of them. The fool of the party immediately passed the word for stretcher bearers, & was promptly sat on by a muffled voice - "Stretcher bearers be d---d, come & dig us out before another gets us."
Since I've spent a few wet cold nights in the trenches, I know more about the Kaiser than I ever dreamed of knowing before.
Give my love to all.
Your affectionate son
Arthur
