<p>Woolard and myself first had a feed and then went for a walk. We saw the Notre Dame Cathedral and then wandered round the streets looking at the shops. After tea while the other two men were reading in a Soldiers' Club I decided to see if I could get any pretty souvenirs to send home. It was quite dark but the shops were all lit up and I spent about half an hour looking at them. at last I came to one that was just putting its shutters up and on looking back, saw that all the others were doing the same. I started to retrace my steps but in a very few minutes the whole street was in darkness. I think it must have been caused by an air raid warning. I was not oo sure which street I had to turn down to get to the club as things looked different without he lights, so I wandered on for a good while until I saw that I was leaving the shops behind. So I turned about and this time struck the right street, luckily remembering that a tram line ran down it. we had a bit of supper and then made for our lorry.</p>
