<p>Letters again <u>Censored</u>. Mother 17/2/17, Day 19/2/17 JOE 18/2/17, Clare Wheeler HAY. All so welcome. Yes little Mother your housewife came at last &amp; such a useful one. I can see how you thought of everything little things I wanted &amp; Days SOKS too. So many thanks.</p>
<p>I hope some day to go fishing with JOE on the Hopkins. I always love old Carrakoorte &amp; the River. I cant see how JOE could volunteer &ndash; he is doing more than his share by carrying the load at home - &amp; keeping us going. I see you are sending me another parcel &amp; Barrini sends the Cakes &amp; chocs &ndash; I'm afraid I'm getting terribly spoilt.</p>
<p>I would write Barrini but forget her address.</p>
