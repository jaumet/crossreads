  
 Saturday, 5 June, 1915 Arrived at Lemnos about 9 p.m. all the way in the harbour French warships saluted and cheered when they saw our French soldiers were on. The same demonstration from British tars and coloured troops.  The harbour is full of warships and troopships including the giant Mauritania.  Lemnos has changed since we were here last, once what were bare hills are now camps.  There must be nearly 50,000 troops here.  General Wallace who came over with us went ashore soon after we landed.  we have to wait instructions.  Lord knows what our next move is.  So far Roumania has not come in & America has funked it, but we are still [indecipherable] Turks at Gaba Tepe & Achi Baba. 
 Sunday, 6 June. At ten am we got word that we had to be ready at two to leave the boat, but two passed and eventually we stayed on all night, it is like most of our orders.  All the French troops went off to rejoin their units before reinforcements.  We are steadily advancing from Krithia but Achi baba has not fallen yet, engineers of every allied nationality are being hurried there so it is expected that there will be a big engineering feat shortly I think the only way to take the hill will be to blow part of it up.  Still on duty my three patients are now on the mend but two will be sent back to Eng. medically unfit.
