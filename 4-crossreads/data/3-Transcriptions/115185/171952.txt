He is very quiet but quite a dear &ndash; and will be very grateful for any kindness shown him as he quite on his own in Australia. I am hoping to get some more money and will have it paid into Fathers account it out to come to &amp;pound 21. I asked Major Smith about it. We all get it 2/6 a day extra all the time we were on Lemnos. I do not know how many weeks exactly it is since the &amp;pound 1.1.0 a week has been paid into Dad's account at 18 Silk St But I think it began on 1st July 1915. I have not heard any statement about Mr Colville having received it or not. But I suppose it is alright. I should have heard if it was not. It should be about &amp;pound 28 or &amp;pound 30 by now that with the &amp;pound 21 &ndash; will greatly reduce the Debt to Dad.</p>
