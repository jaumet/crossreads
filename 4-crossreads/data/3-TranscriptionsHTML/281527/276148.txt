<p>23/2/18  Boulogne</p>
<p>many innocent acquaintances. The  Anzacs are popular with them &amp; I noticed a few rather tough looking W.A.A.Cs. It seems our chaps had a shooting affray with Portugese (called Pork &amp; Beans &amp; very generally hated)  the other night. 5 Australians &amp; 1 W.A.A.C. were wounded. To No.1 AGH and spent the afternoon yarning to sisters there .Returned to Boulogne with Hoad riding part way on an Ambulance. It had a freight of "head cases" and I could see one man a ghastly mask of white bandages with very small slits cut for eyes mouth &amp; nostrils Many hospitals round here [text blanked out]</p>
