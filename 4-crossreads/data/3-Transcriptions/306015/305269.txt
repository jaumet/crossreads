<p>In the afternoon I went for a walk along the canal to Renescure, 5 Kilos away &amp; after buying a few cards &amp; a cup of tea, returned to camp.</p>
<p>Aug.  9.   The Battalion went through a stunt this morning which consisted in advancing through a wood in scouting order.   After lunch we had another swim.</p>
<p>Aug. 10.  More wood-stunts, scouting &amp; skirmishing etc.</p>
<p>In the evening Norman &amp; I walked in to St. Omer, 5 Kilos each way.</p>
<p>Aug.  11.   I went on leave to St. Omer today from 9 A.M. to 8 P.M.  Not being interested in the Estaminets etc, I wandered all round the city, up the main streets, down the lanes, along the canal banks, &amp; in fact everywhere imaginable.   The town is of a fair size &amp; can boost of a fine cathedral and several large churches.   The cathedral has a magnificent pipe-organ, the richest in design</p>
