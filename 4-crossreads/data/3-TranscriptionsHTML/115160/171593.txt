<p>This weather will do me, altho&#39; the mud makes it unpleasant. We are able to get plenty of coal, but I have not felt the cold yet much. &nbsp;We are in a pretty comfy diggings and have enough to eat.</p>
<p>The older hands (1915) are slipping away here and there, altho&#39; one doesn&#39;t notice them going.</p>
<p>Well, love, look after yourself. &nbsp;It is quite on the boards that I may be back by six months, when I hope to see you with the Biggest-ever Smile up.</p>
<p>Fondest love to Dad Bess &amp; Dock, and fervid squeezes and kisses and love to yourself,</p>
<p>Your loving Son,</p>
<p>James xxxxxx.</p>
