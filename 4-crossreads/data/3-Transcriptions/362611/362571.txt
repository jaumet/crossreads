<p>100 gathered Today!</p>
<p>The "Moeraki" does not go forward to Lyttelton <strike>Tonight</strike>. I must therefore tranship. Whether I go on Tonight, or wait longer in Wellington depends upon messages that I am expecting from Christchurch Today.</p>
<p>I had a very happy time at "Cairnleith". Every hour I spent with you dear people was restful &amp; full of delight. Many heartfelt thanks for giving me such a lovely time. My only wish is that I had sooner escaped from the Board Meetings.</p>
<p>With Best Love &amp; Grateful  Rememberances.<br/>Your affectionate Brother<br/>[indecipherable]</p>
