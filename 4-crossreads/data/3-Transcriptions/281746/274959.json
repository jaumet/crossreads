<p>Oct. 9th<br/>About eight o'clock this morning we quietly moved off.  So quietly did we sail out that we were well into the Gulf before we were aware of it.<br/>A sickly and crowded deck is the result of our sailing out to sea to-day.<br/>We are being escorted by four Japanese warship.  They look well as they cut through the water.</p>
<p>Oct. 10th<br/>The troops seem to have got over their attack of seasickness.  There is more life about them to-day.  Gun practise by the gunners in charge of the guns on the two troopships.  Some substance was thrown overboard into the sea which gave off a yellow smoke which continued rising for a long time.  At this the gunners fired and they struck bulls-eyes every time.  This looked bad for any submarines which should come in our way.</p>
