<p>Ypres</p>
<p>28/9/16  Called at 3am and prepared Intelligence Report and read until 7.30.  Dressed and got ready to go on into Ypres and see Jack. Left our Battn HQ at 10.30 with RSM Porter and crossed by duckboard tracks until the ruined city came in sight.  It is a walled town compactly built inside a large thick wall outside which is a moat.  Entrance under the wall is by means of a tunnel &amp; you then find yourself in a street of ruins which leads to the centre of the city.  Not one house remains whole and rugged skeletons of brick are all that stand.  The large market square is reached and one can stand there and let the scene of devastation sink in.  On the four sides of the square where were formerly hotels, shops and houses remain nothing but debris.  The old cloth hall is a majestic ruin of what must have once been a triumph of architecture.  The statues with which its front was adorned now lie in fragments on the ground and those that have not fallen from their niches are defaced.  I met Jack at the [23rd?] HQ and we walked round through the cloth hall to the shell of the Cathedral.  We sat down there on the fallen pillars and shattered columns and yarned.  The headquarters is in a ruined hospital &ndash; a fine old building that is well "dinged".  The lower portion well sandbagged up is habitable to a limited extent.  Great fissures are in the walls and the fine entrance hall is blown to bits and most of it mural tablets are destroyed.  Met  Fovode here and had lunch and dinner with Colonel Brazenor.  Guns bark from among the ruined houses and the Hun was furiously blazing at some of our aeroplanes circling overhead.  Ypres represents the neck of a battle which widens out in the Salient.  Crammed close together within its walls this must have been a fine compact city of comfortable dwellings and prosperous business places.  Now not one is whole.  Relief was completed in good order and all hands were into these billets by midnight.  During the night the 8th did a raid on their front.</p>
