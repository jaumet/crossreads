 1916. 
 at all times had to be able to raise steam, & proceed to sea at the shortest notice.  There were 3 watches of Stokers, one of which in turn, was always on watch.  At night, when at 4 hours notice for full speed, only half a watch was kept on duty.  The Engine Room artificers kept watch only at sea, & in harbour overhauled machinery, etc.  The department was organised for every conceivable emergency, from fire & torpedo to collision & action.  I felt leaving the "Australia" very keenly, for I had made many good friends in her in the past 3 1/2 years.  I had seen her in the piping times of peace in all the gay trappings of a smart flagship, and in the sombre rig of a fighting ship in wartime.  Her ills had been my ills for 3 1/2 years.  In her I had been round the whole world, & I had been happy the whole time in her.  I had received loyal support from the members of the Engine Room department & I regretted leaving them particularly, and the praise which I received from my Captain on leaving the ship was really due to them.  A better crowd, I never wish to sail with.

 I left the ship on December 19th., in a blinding snowstorm.
