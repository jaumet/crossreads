<p>16/2/19 Bonn<br/>smaller than Cologne. The streets were full of a Sunday crowd and many shops were open. Crowds of fine looking healthy young men many in partly military attire and bearing the army stamp. The girls fresh &amp; natural looking &ndash; many very pretty. The buildings very fine and solidly picturesque &ndash; little difference between here and England. The usual number of squares and all the shops well stocked. Clothes seem shoddy shabby and cheap while boots have cloth tops &amp; wood soles. Some excitement was caused by an armed guard marching up a squad of arrested civilians some of whole looked very surly. To us everyone was servilely civil and much saluting and crawling. Noticed a church 1692 and could not but be struck with the prosperous solid look of Beethoven's home town</p>
