<p>Patrolling<br/>Lunched with Mohammed Pasha, a fine old educated Pasha, who has travelled a lot &amp; been Host to KITCHENER   All the Egyptians love "K"  Mohammed gave me Brandy 50 years old &amp; a good dinner.  He had 2 lovely rings one a Ruby as big as a Rand the other a Signet ring with Antiquity Stone of old Egyptian days handed down from Father to Son- dressed in a Black silk Robe he sat playing with his Amber Beads, like R.C.  With my mongrel french we had an enjoyable meal &amp; I am thoroughly enjoying the whole show at present, but not much actual fighting<br/>Recd. Mother's letter Card looked like 17/12/15- for Birthday</p>
