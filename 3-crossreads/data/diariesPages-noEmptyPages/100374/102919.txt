There being three Scotties in the D.R. the Scotch dialect seems to tickle the fancy of the "foreigner" and there was much good natured banter at the peculiarities ascribed to Scotsmen by our officers.

We evacuated 104 patients to-day. We like these evacuations as they relieve us of a great deal of dressing of wounds when they are evacuated from our station to the base.

Had a cross country walk to Doulieu, spent a good part of the afternoon watching the movements of the numerous aeroplanes as they made their evolution on their way from the "Line" to the Aerodrome.

A thing that has struck me very much since coming here is the large number of people, men, women, boys and girls who are working in the fields, digging, planting, hoeing, gathering and yet only a few miles away the troops are face to face with the enemy. Any day the enemy may break through and all the hard work done by these people go for not.

The people cling to the soil, cling to the home that they have been brought up in and which they love. This is really a lesson in "hope" to all who have eyes to see.

On duty in D.R. all day to-day. Late in the evening two badly smashed up cases came in an before we finished them
