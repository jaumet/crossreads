<p>Friday 25th<br/>Put in some pretty hard pick &amp; shovel work at the new communication trenches.</p>
<p>Saturday 26th<br/>Had a fairly easy day only 4 hrs on the pick &amp; shovel.</p>

<p>Monday 28th<br/>Very hot day. We had to stand to arms at 12 o'clock.  About 12.30 portion of our Brigade attacked the Turks on the right &amp; occupied the Balkan Gun Pits.  It was fairly lively.  The 5th had a good few casualties mostly wounded slightly.  However</p>
