<p>4 July 1915<br/>Sunday 8 wks of go</p>
<p>Out of the 10 letters I got 3 from Nell &amp; 4 from home everything is great at home thank goodness, nothing much happened through the night just the usual rifle fire, we blew up [indecipherable] last night at 10 &amp; this led to a friendly exchange of lead, we were down at 701 again this afternoon &amp; were just in time to see the French explode 7 mines &amp; then converge all their arty on to the ridge to the L of Achi, it presented a beautiful sight especially at sundown (golden) over at the back of imbros, we watched a Turkish Bn move from Gaba to Achi  &amp; not a shot was fired at them, the beach on which we were supposed to land has 6 rows of barb out of the water &amp; at least another 3 in the water this extends right under &amp; past the fort, so I guess we would have struck rich. Got a letter from Norm his doing OK &amp; Wags gives me latest news from [indecipherable]</p>
<p>5 July 1915<br/>Monday 37 wks from home</p>
<p>The Turks gave us a rather rude awakening this morning for they had all their guns including a new howitzer they had brought up through the night with this they were feeling for our 6" how but no such luck, late last night they dropped a Jack J on to the depot but did no damage After lunch we went for the usual swim, after which we strolled up to the observation post &amp; spent a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon first thing of note was 2 Regts of the enemys [indecipherable] &amp; no sooner had we sighted them than our howitzers opened fire with lyditte 2 shots fixed them up then they shelled the road for hours. The trawlers meanwhile were having a little game of their own out to sea, &amp; after a while we saw a submarine under the water using her Deisel engines the exhausts threw a column of water 3 ft high &amp; 100 feet long she was using both her Deisel &amp; elect motors trying to get away as two trawlers had her in a net. Monitor accompanied by a aeroplane started to shell hill 701 with howitzers</p>
