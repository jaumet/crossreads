 Monday 17 December 1917 E. Brown off for day &amp; VA.D. (Mrs. Madden) helping.  Off duty 5-8.  Went 14 A.G.H., Dick unable secure pass so I must hunt for a partner for "day off" at 27 G.H.  Feeling very depressed over home news about new niece's parents, surely it cannot be true as I fear that 3 lives are to be wrecked after the friendship of childhood days. "Ah well is thee;  thou are asleep!" might truly be said of our dear Father and Kath, to be spared this sadness &amp; our little Mother in her old age to be burdened &amp; worried so!  Truly marriage is a mistake after all. Pt. in ward has photo of rows of English dead lying for 6 months unburied (left by Turks) until the Australians came &amp; took the position &amp; made the Turks bury the dead in long rows.
