hurt talk about luck.
The reason for all this activity is pretty plain, there is going to be a raid by the 7th Batt. tomorrow night things are promising for a lively night.
Just at tea time the Captain came rushing in ordered us all to get out of the line as soon as possible for there was going to be a very heavy bombardment at 5?oclock, so out we all trooped to the 2nd line waited for it, she came alright our guns mortars crashed roared raged for full 30 minutes but the enemy contrary to expectations never replied so after the storm was past back we went. 
The weather is holding fine the days are quite nice, I can hear the guns on the Somme real plain to-day
