27/3/18 ? La Basse Ville
night a stray minnenwerfer came over on to No. 7 post and killed Parsons. Blew one leg right off and also the other foot. Decorated with M.M. Croix de Guerre this good lad was one of the best and a good cool young subaltern is gone. Slept until mid-day. About 2 p.m. walked across to James? H.Q. and had a yarn with him. Sellick ticked off the British Line down South in accordance with the latest messages. Hun now holds a line about where it was when we hopped off in July 1916. The which is rotten for our morale.
