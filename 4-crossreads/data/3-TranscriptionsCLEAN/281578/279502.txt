  
 usual we lumped a shovel & extra stuff , on to our usual weight) we came to some trench where we were told to halt. We are the company in support, as usual had to start digging a new trench, but thank Goodness, there's an excellent sleeping pozzy dug, covered in overhead. Tuesday 14 May At  2 a.m. we knocked off digging, reported to company headquarters & went on ration carrying. I hate that job, we went down to an overhead bridge in the town near the railway station (ruined by shells now). It was a slippery walk, but coming back, after the limber arrived, & carrying the tea, it was brighter & a chap could see better where he was going. We only carried to D Coy, so didn't have the long walk to the front line. Had some tea & bacon at 4 a.m., the latter was all fat. We did look-out duty in turn for 2 hours in our section (only 5 of us), & slept in our pozzy all day long. I had a snack of bread, butter (margarine rather) & jam at 5 p.m.. It is very quiet, some aeroplanes up now, but not many shells flying here just now. Went down for rations (stew & tea) at 9 p.m. It struck me while waiting at the place where the limbers bring the food, what a mess Fritz would make
