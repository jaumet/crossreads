Dear Mr. ArmstrongYour dear son (Pte. J.V. Armstrong No. 2518, 39th A.I.F.) was admitted some days ago suffering from Gun shot wound of abdomen chest. His condition has been very bad since the beginning although everything possible has been done for him he is still very seriously ill and I'm afraid there is very little hope of recovery.
