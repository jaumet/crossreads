One of our boys caused a riot wiht them at dinner time & had to run for his life, they were making themselves too familiar & would'nt keep away from the lorry, so his nibs threatened them with a revolver & that was enough they got hold of any - thing they could lay their hands on & his nibs sought safety in flight (& the surest way with those fanatics) I was'nt there most of us went along & parked in the Place Plichon (Bailleul) & waited. I bought some new parts for my primus burner 8.francs 25c. we took the chows home early on account of the riot - we got home 2.30 P.M.
