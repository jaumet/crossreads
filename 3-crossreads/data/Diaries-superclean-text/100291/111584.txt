Usual duties. Mac.B. put on ward F. Pans pills. 1300 patients accommodated in this joint. They represent some work for the staff. I suppose I'll come a "gutser" (soldier parlance) have to do a term as ward orderly some time. After tea Cart. takes me to the home of some French friends. Nice people. daughter plays splendidly. Great old singsong, solos duets. Quite a little bit of home. After long months in the line this release is like a dream.
