  FRANCE . 
  February 1918 . 
 DEAR PEOPLE, 
    I am on the same old job as before, "Scout Officer" it suits me for very few officers know anything about N.M.L. and I am usually left to do my little job without interferences, of course were it done other than well, I would hear about it, but as it is I work out my little game as I will and "Nobuddy sez nuthink to me. 
    In a few days time I set off for a week's instructing, a British Brigade has requested my services and so away I go again.  What an awful thing I'll have to join the police when I return and raid Chow Betting joints for excitement.  Anyhow it's an appreciation and a compliment and shows that past work must have been good.  I'll send you a copy of their request when enough time has passed to make it innocuous. 
    Major Hurry is one of the most considerate men alive, he is very hardworking and brave too, he delights in sharing the boys' perils and the boys realize this and call him "The Old Prince." 
    I can think of nothing else of general interest for a semi-public letter. 
    BEST WISHES, 
       HAROLD.
