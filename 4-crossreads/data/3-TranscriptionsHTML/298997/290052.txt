<p>to Godeswardveldt , where we entrained for Amiens.  Apparently an idea that we must be kept in good form has stuck the authorities, for we were given a hot meal, from our own cookers before they were shipped &amp; the train started.  The journey was tedious; and we arrived at Amiens at night moving straight out to billets at Allonville.  It was too dark to make any observation of the way; and we were all extremely tired: the march to Allonville itself was a long one.  Our cooker had travelled ahead, and we had a hot meal waiting; after which sleep came quickly.</p>
<p>April 7<br/>Our billets are in  the barns of a filthy old farm-house, a place that is full of the stench of rotten straw &amp; refuse.  The whole place is old; in the centre of the yard which the building surround is a regular cesspit of decayed matter, covered with straw, into which one of our horse sank nearly to his body. The whole village of Allonville is a wretched one; with the exception of a couple of big houses the houses are huts of a sort of plaster over rough wood frames.  The people are filthy &amp; morose; in the centre of the village is a pond into which the drainage of the place seems to have run for centuries.  Other villages in the neighbourhood seem to be much the same;</p>
