Tuesday 30th MayReveille at 3.30 A.M. & having everything all packed ready we were early on the road to Ferry Post.  We took up our possie in the Casualty Clearing Hospital tents as they had several empty & were just moving off for Moaska.  We are to carry on the place until relieved by more Tommies.  Everyone appears to be ready to move off & very anxious now.
Wednesday 31st MayManaged to get leave in order to go up to Cairo & draw some cash.  I caught the 8.30 P.M train arriving Cairo somewhere about 1. A.M. the train being late owing to a truck being on fire on the line.  We had our passes examined on the station by the [indecipherable] officer & decided to put up at the Anzac Hostel a place run for soldiers only.  A Gany took us there in a few minutes & after a small supper I turned in & very pleased indeed was I to get into bed as the last two nights I had had very little sleep.  The beds were comfortable & clean there being a great number arranged in a dormitory style.  After a wash shave & boots cleaned operation I had breakfast costing P.T.S.
