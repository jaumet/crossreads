<p>Thursday 20 January 1916<br/>Regimental Parade.  Col. Fuller in Camp all Day.<br/>Concert at night in Recreation Hut.<br/>Received Letters from Home.<br/>These concerts are very well attended in fact the Recreation Hut is crowded out.  Ladies &amp;amp; Gents from Cairo come &amp;amp; greatly assist the Boys in making the nights entertainment worthy.  The Brigadier generally gives a whistling Song &amp;amp; a little speech besides.  Lieu. Hogue takes charge of the arrangements, with the best results.</p>
<p>Friday 21 January 1916<br/>Regimental Route March to Helouan.  Went into Cairo for <strike>Col. Fuller</strike> Box (Wooden) for Capt. Anderson.  <u>Sent curios home.</u>  It has been found that more exercise is required to get the men qualified in packing up &amp;amp; moving away fully equipped within a specified time.  These marches are becoming frequent &amp;amp; each time one sees great improvement.  One gets confidence &amp;amp; knowledge as to how &amp;amp; what to take that will be of the greatest use.</p>
<p>Saturday 22 January 1916<br/>Cleaning up in Camp today.  Sent old Diary &amp;amp; note Book Home, also letters.<br/>The Road to Helouan is a first Class one, built in Kitchener's time &amp;amp; is perfectly flat.  As we pass through the different villages the women &amp;amp; Children watch us with great interest.  The youngsters are taught to sing out for <u>"Backsheesh"</u> which covers everything from a cigarette end to a millene.  The journey takes about 3 hours to do &amp;amp; unless we camp for the night there we boil our Quarts &amp;amp; rest a couple of Hours before returning to Maadi.  It is a common sight to see the Civilian Prisoners going &amp;amp; returning from work.  They are chained together with light chains &amp;amp; are escorted by Mounted Police (Egyptian) with loaded carbines.  They look a hardened crowd &amp;amp; occupy their time in the Stone Quarries or making roads.<br/>These are long sentenced men 8-10 15 &amp;amp; 20 years of duration.</p>
