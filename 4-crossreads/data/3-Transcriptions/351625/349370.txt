<p>walk into the country side where there are plenty of blackberries &amp; wild apples.  Nearly every night we have some amusements on, small concert parties, etc., &amp; wist drives.  There are about 40 odd men here altogether mostly Australians, they are all convalescent patients.  My finger is nearly better now but I expect to be here for a fortnight or so yet, I had lost my nail but nothing worse, I wouldent have minded if they had taken my finger off, it would have taken longer to heal up.  On leaving here I will be going on my 14 days leave</p>
