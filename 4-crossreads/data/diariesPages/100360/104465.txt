Sat. Dec. 15 Packed up cushion cover & Photo & gave to Rex Rodd, to take back with him on the Hospital Ship; for Mother. Also sent Photo to France. Went down to Mess Hut for my first meal. It is not at all Bad, nice & warm & cheerful & we get the tucker hot. Old Bandy brought the Photo along. It is really good. Now I have to raise 15/- to pay for it. Spoke to Capt Fox about getting a trip on the transport back Home. He rushed down to the Registrar’s Office where he put up a good argument, but they informed me that only C class men were taken on for those Jobs, so my chances of seeing Lill are again at a very low level. Anyhow I finished Letter 47 & posted it

Sun. Dec. 16. Cold, wet, snowy day. Very few visitors. I sat in the Canteen eating Cakes & drinking weak Tea. Old "Bandy" brought the Picture along of Lill & I, but I didn’t have the money to pay for it, so he will have to wait till I’ve seen the Registrar.

Mon. 17. One of the Red X Ladies promised to sew my Blotter Cover, so I took it down to the Sewing Room & left it. She didn’t have enough material to finish it, but promised to do it for Wednesday. Jolly good Concert in Hall. "The Cheer-ohs" All Girls.
