 Thursday 6 December 
 Frosty &amp; bitterly cold. Big run to 1st Anzac Corp. after dropping the usual returns at Dranoutre.  Took a new course today from Dranoutre to Bailleul via Neuve Eglise road &amp; Ravetsburg. German Planes busy tonight &ndash; one came under the concentrated flares from our searchlights &amp; an antiaircraft shell got him.  It was a pretty sight to see him fall in flames.  Many bombs were dropped
