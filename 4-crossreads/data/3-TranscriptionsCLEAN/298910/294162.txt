I've always wished to see the world, I ad no chanst 'beforeNor I don't suppose I should ave, if there and't been no warI used to read the tourists books, the shipping news also.An I ad the chance of going, so I couldn't help but go,
We ad a spell in Egypt, first before we moved along,Across the way to Suvla where we got it & strongWe had no drink when we was dry, no rest when we was tiredBut I've seen the pyramids an Spinks which I had oft desired.
I've seen them little islands too, I couldn't say their namesAn Towns as white as washing day & mountains spouting flameI've seen the sun come lonely up on miles & miles o' sea,Why folks have paid a undred pounds, an seen no more than me.
I always wished to see the world, I'm fond of life & changeBut a bullet got me in the leg an this is passin' strangeThat when old Englands shore all wrapped in mist & rain'Why its worth the bundle to be coming home again.
When we recall fond memorys dearWhich cling to us from year to yearOf by gone days, in lands afar,Those memories sweet how dear they are Remembrance.
