<p>3rd August:- Thursday<br/>Awakened at 7 am &amp;  having completed my toilette &amp; a good breakfast set forth. The Belgian has departed by 5.30 am, having to return to Belgium after his leave in England. (He had been wounded badly in the wrist)    &amp; we exchanged addresses. Take a walk along the Thames Embankment &amp; view the captured German submarine mine-layer U5 lying beside the embankment. Reach the office at 9-30 am &amp; receive instructions to depart from Charring Cross Station at 11-35 am. Talk about rush. I didn't expect this, at least, but it's the usual way of the army. Receive pay to the extent of 10/- &amp; living allowing for the four days we have been kept waiting around London (16/-). I make straight to my diggings  &amp; hurriedly roll my overcoat &amp; fully equipped</p>
