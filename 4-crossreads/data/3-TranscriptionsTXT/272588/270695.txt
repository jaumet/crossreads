 Tuesday 23 April Things have been quiet about here all day but to-night a heavy artillery activity was evident on the left.  French front Battalions change over to-night &amp; early in the morning there is a bit of a stunt in the direction of Meteren.  Exactly what I cannot say. 
 Wednesday 24 April Just after midnight this morning an attack was made on Meteren without artillery preparation by the 3rd Brigade.  The Boche line was alive with machine guns &amp; our men made good targets for the German Gunners in the moonlight.  Ye Gods, it was a gutser! &amp; our chaps suffered heavy casualties, mostly coming through this post.  I have been carrying all day up till midnight.  However, he left our roads alone &amp; never shelled back at all. Again, this afternoon, the artillery fire on our left was terrific &amp; on our front our people gave him some gas.
