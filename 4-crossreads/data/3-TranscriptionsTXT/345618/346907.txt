 A.J.'s farewell 
 And so you're off to Palestine! Let's drink a cup for auld lang syne &ndash; Gin is the surest anodyne For every woe. I hope the weather will be fine &ndash; It looks like snow. Sailing's the devil when it's snowing And more than half a gale is blowing, For you can't see which way you're going Or what's ahead; 
 And any moment &ndash; there's no knowing &ndash; You may be dead! This is not quite the time of year That one would choose to volunteer For foreign service.  It's d-d queer And mighty risky &ndash; U boats are always in or near That Bay of Biscary.
