 Monday April 3rd. All hands at work packing up again, we move off to Railhead in the cool of the evening. There will be no swimming parades there, very little water, so we are in for an enjoyable time, as the weather is becoming hotter every day. Moved off at 4 p.m. covered the eight miles in good time. Bivouac for the night. 
 4th April 1916. Everyone hard at work in the early hours of the morning shifting gear &amp; stores etc. You must certainly buy a furniture removers business for me, as after so much experience in the moving line, I should make a good hand at the game. The Sections are being split up. A Section going three miles in one direction, &amp; B about 4 miles in another direction. The Transport are staying at Railhead. A Section move off for their new home, myself &amp; four fellows were chosen to remain behind to act as a rear guard,  will follow on to A Section in a couple of days. 
 Wednesday 5th April. Sorting up stores etc. Only sending out to the Outposts the gear they will require, the remainder is being kept by the transport.
