<p>our waggon lines just out of 'Poperingyue', guns in the town of 'Ypres', about the hottest part of the globe we have been in as you will see later, for here we get rumours that 'Haigh' is going to make one of his greatest pushes &amp; will mean a lot of hard &amp; solid fighting for we know the Hun is very strong on this front.</p>
<p>I will just give you our casualties for the first week. 23rd one driver killed, 24th a gun detachment gased, consisting of four men &amp; No. 1 or sergeant. 26th four badly wounded besides several slight cases of gas, just enough to put them of duty for a few days &amp; one of "specks", face badly</p>
