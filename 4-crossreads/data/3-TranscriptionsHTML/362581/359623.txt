<p>My darling Eddy&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XOXOXO</p>
<p>Your letter was lovely   &amp;  you are writing very clever letters now. You will be a very big boy when I return. Hope you are having a jolly holiday   &amp;  shall be able to go every day next term to school. You must tell me all about your Nature Study lessons   &amp;  your Physical Culture. I can hardly imagine you a big boy at school now. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses  OXOXOXOX From XOX<br/>Auntie Eadle.</p>
