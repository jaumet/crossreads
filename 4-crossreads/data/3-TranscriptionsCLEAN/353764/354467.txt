a lot of our fellows out & to cap all we have to trek out to Serapeum No2 Railway Siding to draw 100 Wagons & leave our old ones there.  This is a fearful job as the wagons have got to be man handled through deep sand & loaded on the Trucks.The work all day has been cruel coupled with climatic conditions & the job has to be continued tomorrowReveille at 3 am to cross the Bridge early.To cap all a lot of us have been inoculated again & I am feeling it very much & as tomorrow will be my worst day I am not in a happy frame of mind.
16.5.16Am feeling as sick as can be & am suffering absolute agony with the Heat, Wind Sand & InoculationWe are now getting the Wind Hot & strong which blows in from the Arabian Desert & at times you have to lay face downwards to get free of the flying sand.  Every one of us are absolutely full up of this place & we all pray to get out of  it.  I am afraid that some of the men will go out
