31.3.15Wed. 31st.  We had a very easy day of it.  Nelson, Stan & I, rode out onto the desert a couple of miles & were signalling back to camp with the Heliograph at 11.30 we returned to Camp, & had a sprint to test Stan's mount on the way home, but Idleboy finished up in the lead;  had nothing to do after dinner;  Stan went into Heliopolis to receive a lesson in French with some lads of the 14th Btn.  I stayed in writing;  Pitt & Cameron came home "blithered" & caused a good deal of amusement, for half an hour or so.
