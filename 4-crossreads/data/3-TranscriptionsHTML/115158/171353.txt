<p>the excitement of the recent action.</p>
<p>June. 4</p>
<p>We suddenly learnt that H.M.S. Hampshire had struck a mine, whilst conveying Lord Kitchener &amp; his staff to Archangel.&nbsp; There were only 12 survivors.&nbsp; I had seen Hampshire leaving in the evening about 6.30.p.m., the weather being very rough, but I did not know that Lord Kitchener was on board.&nbsp; His presence among us was kept very quiet.&nbsp; The &quot;Hampshire&quot; sunk about 8.30 p.m., two hours after leaving harbour.&nbsp; It appears that destroyers were to have taken Lord Kitchener across to Norway.&nbsp; That was the original intention.&nbsp; The weather conditions, however, became so bad on the day appointed, that it was not considered advisable to allow Lord Kitchener to proceed in a destroyer.&nbsp; At the last moment &quot;Hampshire&quot;, a large cruiser, was ordered to take the distinguished soldier to Archangel, and as the wind was blowing fiercely from an Easterly direction, &quot;Hampshire&quot; was ordered to proceed round the west side of the Orkney Islands in order to take advantage of the lee of the land, rather than take the usual easterly course.&nbsp; Shortly after &quot;Hampshire&quot; left Harbour the escorting destroyers were compelled to return, as they were unable to weather the seas at the high speed at which &quot;Hampshire&quot; was proceeding.&nbsp; It must have been shortly after the escorting destroyers left her that she struck the mine&nbsp; Thus we suffered the gravest misfortune,</p>
