<p>Tue. 2nd Apl. (cont.)<br/>Dinner over, &amp; we were consuming lager, coffee ersatz, &amp; cigarettes when two young ladies sat down at our table &ndash; it was the only vacant space in the room.   We had quite a chatty time for an hour or so &ndash; they did not understand a word of English and my German provided the amusement of the party.   Then my unteroffizier, beaming and kameradish owing to the feed I had given him, actually proposed going home to his flat for the evening.   (He lived at Hamburg.)</p>
<p>We crossed the imposing Bahnhof Platz and boarded an "electrischer", via the Rathaus Platz and St. Pauli finally reaching a place out near Hagenbecks Tier Park.   I kept well out of sight on the darkened back of the car during the journey.</p>
