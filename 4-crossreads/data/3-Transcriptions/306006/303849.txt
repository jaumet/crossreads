<p>28-4-17<br/>morning to an observation Post &amp; endeavoured to keep in touch with the squadrons per helio but with poor results as the sky clouded early &amp; it has been a cold cloudy day .</p>
<p>I have been kept very busy lately; Large camel trains have been constantly on the go all day carting water in Fantasees from the Wadi &amp; storing it a few miles back for reserve; Things would have been very uncomfortable here for us if the Turks had remained in possession of the wadi as it is the only decent supply this side of Khan Yunus.
