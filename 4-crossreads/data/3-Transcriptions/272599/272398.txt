<p>May Monday 7 1917</p>
<p>Usual duties.  Mac.B. put on ward  F. Pans &amp; pills.  1300 patients accommodated in this joint. They represent some work for the staff. I suppose I'll come a "gutser" (soldier parlance) &amp; have to do a term as ward orderly some time. After tea Cart. takes me to the home of some French friends. Nice people. daughter plays splendidly. Great old singsong, solos &amp; duets. Quite a little bit of home. After long months in the line this release is like a dream.</p>
