I am sending this letter from England but by the time you get this I will be in the trenches I see they are calling up the men between 21 &amp; 31 &amp; I believe Earnie will have to go. If he does tell him I said not to leave Australia if he can get out of it. It is terrible rough and they treat us like dogs. I am talking serious. Tell him to take a fools advice and be a cold foot. Never mind what people say about him. That is if he has to enlist.<br/>Oh well I think I have told you all this time so I will conclude with best love from your loving son Chris xxx</p><p>Robinson<br/>Mudgee N.S.W.</p><p>[Transcribed for the State Library of New South Wales]</p>
