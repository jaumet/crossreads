<p>colonel told us that the 1st done very well in their attack last night: heavy gunfire all day: this is war all right not play like Bois Grenier one roar all the time: Albert is a nice town though badly knocked about : there are a lot of large stacks &amp; they have lost their "plumb" with a vengeance: the beautiful church is ruined  the large image of the virgin is hanging out at right angles  from the tower &amp; has been like that for 15 months now: I believe the statue weighs  7 ton: diagram of the tower            showing how the statue is hanging: the railway seems to be still working well &amp; shunting is busy: There does not seem to be many civillians there: I got a "P" of the church: after tea had a good concert &amp; some good songs were rendered: all the time here we are in readiness to move off in "fighting" order any moment: we have "dumped' our packs &amp; our whiskers will look terrifying in a few "days": got some fruit from a canteen motor &amp; it supplemented  our biscuits &amp; bully well: plenty of aeros &amp; balloons:</p>
