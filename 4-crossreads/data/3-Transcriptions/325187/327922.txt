<p>Our men are shewn on same page.<br/>Sydney Mail of May 10th shows a Pontoon Bridge built not by the Australian Engineers but by the Cheshires, it is our Camp near the trees in the background- &amp; the Pontoon bridge is over a Canal, not the Nile:-<br/>Another Taube over us this morning 4 bombs on Kantara- it is wearisome standing to arms at 3.30 AM &amp; then every time an enemy plane flies over:-  First time I've seen an Aerial Fight but one battle plane was not fast enough tho' she fired repeatedly it was most exciting to watch from the ground- they did travel- the Taube as far as I could see went towards the Mediteranean &amp; our machine got hit in the engine.  They were right over us-</p>
