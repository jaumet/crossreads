March 22nd 1917.
A peculiar kind of day, one minute it is snowing heavily & another time the sun is shining. The enemy is shelling a village which is about a mile ahead of us. A number of us were working with a Company of Infantry preparing the roads. I do pity these fellows, all these days that we have been having an easy time, they have been doing the fighting. The Infantry deserve all the praise & glory in this struggle. Can you imagine what taking a village means, the village in flames & & the fearful fighting going on etc., it is really too terrible to write about. It looks very nice in the papers another village being captured etc. but do we think what this really means.  The loss of life & the terrible hardships endured etc. The men who do the fighting are the real heroes in this war.
