it, so the boy's are having a pretty keen search for it you can bet, but I fancy he will never see it again for the mud is so deep sloppy.
This morning I hear that the reason of the heavy German bombardment last night was that they were withdrawing a Division were sending them to the Somme" I pity them, but if they thought this ruse would succeed they evidently were greatly mistaken for our guns were shelling away beyond the lines on to their lines of communication, in spite of the violence of Fritz's shelling he only succeeded in wounding 2 men in our Batt. But it is no good saying one thing meaning another the Germans are not as good marksmen as the British they may have been better perhaps at the beginning of the war, but no, not now.
