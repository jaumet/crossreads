 Tuesday 22 August 1916 A warm summer's day. Left Warloy Baillon about 9 o'clock &amp; came through Vadencourt, Herissait, &amp; Val de Maison to La Vicogne, arriving about 1.30 after a dusty march. Crops along the route were quite ripe for the most part, &amp; in many places harvesting was in full swing, binders &amp; scythes being operated by very young or very old folk. One wished that a few battalions of our men might be put on to the ground to get the crops all in before it is too late. Lunch was ready for us, &amp; during the afternoon took things easy, going to C Co. of the 2nd Bn. for dinner. Slept out under the trellised archway behind the house.
