 Dear Mr. Layton, Could you give Mrs Taylor some help? She seems much in need of it. 
 She will explain her case. 
 I will make some inquiries at Barracks about her husband - He probably has gone back to Rabaul & she has not  heard  had time to hear from him. 
 Believe me Yours sincerely E. M. Wallack
