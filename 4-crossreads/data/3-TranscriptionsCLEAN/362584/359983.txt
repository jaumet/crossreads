 My dear mother, 
 I have just brought a coat & pair of boots that would rejoice your heart. The coat is lined with white fur, & is so warm that I feel like a half-hatched egg. The boots are beauties, double-soled & absolutely water tight, reaching almost up to my knees. With gloves, I am a walking puzzle - find the man. 
 I called on Miss Miles the other day. She was awfully nice & offered to do all sorts of things for me. Poor Myles has been wounded again, this time, I think, seriously, though he writes very cheerfully. I am trying to find out exactly where he is as they can tell me nothing at Horseferry road. 
 Mrs Edwards has written several times
