  
 19th June. Monday - 111  in the shade The new list of those to proceed overseas to England with the next contingent is posted today & I am not included, whilst many who have been here but one month are going. This is my last bitter cup. Have been working my hardest for weeks & they are to give my work to others. 
 20th June Does the army not want me. It seems so & I will take my first chance out now. Nothing but bad luck here   Last night I was up all night sick &  vomiting    The heat has evidently got  me & I see the doctor who gives me no duty  Temp 112  in the shade 
 21st June To-day is awful. What heat. In bed all day feeling very ill &  not able to eat  The doctor has ordered me  milk food only & a rest for two days    & I can do with it very well
