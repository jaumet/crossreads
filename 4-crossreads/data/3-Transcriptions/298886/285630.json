<p>modern warfare shell after shell was bursting among us killing horses and wounding men Batallions of Enemy infantry were advancing across the open country (a splendid target for artillery) the Guns had been firing all day as fast as the men could feed the Guns and now at a most critical moment, when we wanted the pressure relieved on our left flank and a few well directed shells would have done the trick we are informed that "I have only 20 rounds left!"</p>
<p>3.45 pm. 9.8.16</p>
<p>"Retire in sections!"   Small parties come back right through a tornado of shells and bullets over that fire swept Zone &amp; strange to say seldom getting hit at least not dropped, which is fortunate plenty of men &amp; horses are hit but not seriously.  wounded are brought back to comparative safety (I use the word "comparative" here its very fitting) because there was no actual safety. We moved back over the open ground amidst a chorus of bursting and shrieking high Xplosive shells, shrapnel and bullets and after being somewhat reorganized moved to a fresh position to cover the retirement of the remainder of the troops who were coming out of other parts of the firing line.</p>
<p>4.30.pm.<br/>Moved out of that position and took up another one further back with a good commanding view just as the high xplosive shells</p>
