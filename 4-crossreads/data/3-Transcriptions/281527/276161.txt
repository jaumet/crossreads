<p>1/3/18  Selles</p>
<p>Heavy snow had fallen during the night and it continued during the day. Accordingly cancelled parades to some extent and had an interview with old Bob Moss reducing him to Corporal. Rode out in heavy snow to the 4th Army range at Blequin where I met Generals Smith &amp; Paton. The ground all white is snow covered and the basin all snowy. Our platoon under Gorman won the Divisional Championship after a good tussle. 20th Bn second and the 28th Bn third. Everyone was hugely delighted about it as some of the others were very cocky. Received congratulations from all round. Rode back to Bn HQ and put all the afternoon in indoors it being cold and snowy</p>
