<p>sunny day, but cold winds.  We (A.M.C.) are "duty company" for the camp to-day.  Plenty of work.  Whole camp struck, tents &amp; floors rebuilt.  I have parties working at this all morning.  Parade 2 p.m. &amp; after putting line picquets on have little to do, but look round occasionally.  Bitterly cold night &amp; am fortunate in securing another blanket from Sgt. David, an old A.I.F. Hdqrs. friend (now 1st Anzac Hdqrs. &amp; in camp here).  Write letters in Sgts Mess until 8 p.m. &amp; turn in.</p>
