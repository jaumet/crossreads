<p>but if they are in a position to do so, it is expected, and the money is again available elsewhere.<br/>I saw Mr. Budden yesterday, told him I was writing to you &amp; he wished to be very kindly remembered to you.  He is no doubt "The right man in the right place" so full of energy &amp; enthusiasm and <strike>a</strike> such a fine personality.<br/>I began this letter yesterday and told you the Unit was still at Gezirah, a lot moved to No. 1 yesterday.  They are just boarding there &ndash; and the rest go to-day.<br/>Yesterday morning Mrs. Lethbridge &amp; I walked over to the Sultan's Place at eleven to see the Guard changed, it was a fine and impressible sight.  Have so often heard it was worth going to see but always being occupied in the morning never had an opportunity, so very glad I went.<br/>Now I must close or you'll be so weary you'll be dropping my scrawl in the waste-paper basket, going on eleven months since I left Sydney &amp; I hav'nt the faintest notion when I'll return.<br/>Very much love to you all from Mer. &amp; myself.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately<br/>Hennie Fletcher</p>
