into our doings photographing.
I went with Joyce Wilkins on an ambulance lorry to the Hooge crater, had considerable excitement on account of the Boche shelling the road. Afterwards we went through the infamous Chateau Wood up the enfiladed road to Westhock Ridge. This region always suffers heavy shelling we passed through nearly a mile of straffed limbers waggons dead horses. I have not seen a more terrible scene of desolation, waste destruction than hereabouts on Westhock. The Boche observation on his area is superb, the least congestion invariably brings shelling. We returned over the duckboards by a safer route to Hellfire Corner, thence on to Ypres. A fine sunset beautified these solemn ruins, that awakened feelings of awe made one sorrow for the things which war has done. Took 18 plates.
