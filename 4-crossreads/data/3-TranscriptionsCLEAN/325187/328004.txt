[Monday 18 September 1916]
St Annes-on-Sea. Much better, but raining.Quite a lot of wounded men are here.Breakfast in bed & every luxury.  Mr Ish senior goes to Manchester every day so Dolly & I have the day to ourselves.  "Pa" offers to rent a Farm & me pay nominal interest in England- but I must go Home & show you "Dolly" & see how she stands Station life first- I would hate to leave you in Australia.Bronchitis much better.
