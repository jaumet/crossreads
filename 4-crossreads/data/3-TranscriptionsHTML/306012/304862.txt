<p>men one sees are in the grey-green uniform of the Italian army (private's pay 5d. per diem).  There are some very pretty women but they do not dress as well as the Parisiennes.  I was surprised in Turin &amp; Milan &ndash; we do not associate red hair &amp; blue eyes with this country.  The Romans are dark and the Napolitans darker still.<br/>Food seems fairly plentiful in hotels &amp; restaurants although I noticed people lining up in food queues in different places (there is not too much bread &amp; sugar available).  The Italian meal consists of fewer courses than the French but each is more plentiful.  Plenty of macaroni &amp; spagetti, of course, although other dishes can be substituted if one does not fancy these more or less tasty edibles.  Wine, fruit, nuts &amp;</p>
