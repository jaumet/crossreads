the Flying Machines coming going to the Aerodrome close by until 2 Pm when said Good bye to the Sailor boys started back to the Station. On approaching the Wharves we saw a number of the Armed Motor Launches proceeding out to Sea, they soon got up speed seemed to fly through the Water making a big spray in their wake, the Sun was nice warm the air fairly clear the Sea Planes soon started on their work, several of them passed us each contained 3 men look grand gliding along the water before taking the Air. As we have seen any amount of Aeroplanes in our Travels but no Aeroplanes Seaplanes it was a grand sight to us all we were greatly interested watched them rise disapear out of sight. They soon were mixed with the Aeroplanes flying about, we were told later that the Sea Planes were from America. We continued on our way until we arrived back at the Supply depot were we obtained our big Coats said Good Bye to our Ausie friends off we set for the Railway Station arriving there at 3 Pm tired weary soon into a Carriage had a good rest.
