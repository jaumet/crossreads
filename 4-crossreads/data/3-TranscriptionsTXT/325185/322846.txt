I dare say Haining has called to see you before this. So he will be abel to tell you how things have been up to the time he left. I havint had any word from him so far but havint had any mail since December. Well there is  really very little one can write about from here as you know one cant write from here the same as in England. Have to write as well to all the others yet so shall have to close. Love & best wishesFrom your sincere son Clyde
