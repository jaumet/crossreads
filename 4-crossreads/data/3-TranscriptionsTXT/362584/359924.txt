 Today is Saturday &amp; I have just come in from watching a boxing tournament. Some of the fights were very sanguinary &amp; as the boat is rolling &amp; pitching a good deal very funny to watch. Just as one would step back to evade the other, the boat would give a lurch &amp; hurl him backwards against the ropes with his opponent, a whirlwind of blood &amp; hair &amp; flying gloves on top of him &ndash; much to the delight of the onlookers who would cheer &amp; yell for their favourite till the final decision gave him the palm or the push. 
 Except for a few little entertainments such as this, we work &amp; talk day after day exactly the same as we did the day before. This tournament will give us something fresh to talk about. 
 Heaps of love &amp; remember me to father, Dorothy &amp; Catherine.

 P.S. I have just been in to see Jack. He is quite well &amp; is coming out to-morrow, &amp; wishes to be remembered to you.  K.
