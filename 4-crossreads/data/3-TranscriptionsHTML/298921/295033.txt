<p>March, 1915<br/>Monday 1<br/>Dog tired from doing all I can to see the old Mosques &amp; Drill etc. too but feel the opportunity should not be let go to see these wonderful old places. Beautiful Glass stained windows, black granite pillars, Alabaster columns &amp; inlaid marble floors built 1000's of years ago &amp; Tombs in every one.<br/>As for the present diseased beggars die daily around walls &amp; are carted away &amp; the drab slums are filthy but the Architects of old knew how to build.<br/>Trench digging &amp; outpost work today.</p>
