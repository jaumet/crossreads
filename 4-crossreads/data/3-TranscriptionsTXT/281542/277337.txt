 This morning I am struck by the extreme calm &amp; beauty of the blue Meditteranean &amp; how peaceful a scene it must be to the roaring torment of war which is being raged not many miles ahead.  Today we are at rest on the calm bosom of a summers sea &ndash; tomorrow, aye, tomorrow, perhaps the dread torpedo will send us to the bottom unwarned &amp; to die like rats in a trap.  For we are in the extreme danger zone now of the enemy's submarines.  Only 25 miles ahead one day August 13 last week a troop ship Royal Edward (?) containing drafts &amp; reinforcements for the Med. Imp. force was  sunk  sent to a watery grave &amp; only 25&percnt; of the brave fellows aboard were saved.  And so we sail along taking the same risk.  A great risk but how great is the spirit of our troops.  Happy &amp; debonair they sing like so many larks on a bright April morn &amp; their hearts are big &amp; strong.  They have resigned themselves to the inevitable. 
 We passed the Grecian Archipellago during the day &ndash; Tinos, Denos &amp; Sirra (?).  These towns nestle in the side of steep dun brown hills or along the sea shore &amp; are quite bizarre &amp; picturesque. 
 A beautiful sunset &ndash; here we saw "the roseate hues of the sun-burnt west" in all its magnificent glory. 
 Attended Holy Communion &ndash; Arthur Gray present.

 Arrived at Lemnos at daylight.  A hive of shipping &ndash; warships, troopships, &amp; merchantmen.  Hospital Ships also frequent &ndash; I notice one of the latter named the "Dunluce Castle".  Served with 200 rounds of ammunition each.   Sent a P.C. to Mabel  "Expect to be in action tomorrow". 
 Notice HMAS "Sydney" in harbour.  Served with two days rations.
