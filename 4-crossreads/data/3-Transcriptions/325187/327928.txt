<p>[Tuesday 4 July 1916]</p>
<p>This morning I had an APPLE a real Australian Apple-   Our Doctor got hold of a c/- from Victoria somehow, &amp; out here on the Desert, they were much appreciated-  We get very close to Native on this game, &amp; to dodge about, get a feed, &amp; a sleep come before most things, but all men will come back better for it- tho' I remember being told often after the SA war-<br/>"All the nice men were killed" however I'll waive my claim &amp; come back to the old home again.<br/>Good news re the different Fronts &amp; hope it may continue, our Chaps are getting a lively time in France from all we hear.</p>
