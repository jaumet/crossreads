<p>Dear Mr. Layton &ndash;<br/>Mrs. Bosden's son sailed on October 5th. but she has not received any pay or separation allowance. On enquiry at the Barracks she learns that his name is not on the Boat Roll.</p>
<p>They are telegraphing to the ship to ascertain if there is any mistake &ndash; If this is confirmed from the Pay Office could you assist her &ndash;</p>
<p>She applied to you before but thinks the request was refused owing to her being eligible for separation allowance &ndash;</p>
<p>I am yours sincerely<br/>Mary Booth<br/>Mrs. Bosden saw her son on board.</p>
