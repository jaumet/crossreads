<p>Egypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 10.4.16<br/>2/3/16</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Since last writing on the 21st ult. I have received your letter of 24th Jany &amp; the two parcels of sox that you sent me.  I must thank you very much for the sox as they will come in very useful.  As to the letter I must also thank you for the separate letter re cabling for money.<br/>I made a copy of the form &amp; destroyed the letter as you suggested.  I haven't sent you any cables except the two you have already acknowledged- the first acknowledging my arrival in Egypt &amp; the second for the New Year Wishes.  I havent required any money and I don't think I am likely to, thank you Father dear.  But should I cable you at all I will sign the cable as you suggest as it will distinguish it from any Walter may send.  I had a note from Wal as he was in the Red Sea, he is at present at Heliopolis I believe &amp; if I get a chance will try &amp; get up to see him, Ol &amp; Rid.<br/>To-morrow is your birthday, Father dear, &amp; although this will be many weeks late, it carries with it my best love for yourself &amp; my best wishes for your long-continued health &amp; strength.  Perhaps, all being well, I may be</p>
