<p>12.3.16<br/>My dearest Sister,<br/>I received two letters, one Herald &amp; 3 splashes from you to-day, for which I thank you, if only I was as careful as you in writing so regular you wouldnt have any waiting for news like you have, anyway dear you know I am always thinking of you &amp; look forward to the time when I will be able to repay you personally for all you have done for me since leaving on this campaign.<br/>I am very sorry to hear of Ralph's illness &amp; hope he will pull himself together when his final is over, dont you let him come over here, this isnt the place for married men with people depending on them, there are plenty single men to come yet.<br/>I heard from Dave this mail, he had 10 days leave to go to Lismore re our property there, he fixed things up satisfactorily. I believe the fences etc. are in a very bad state of repair, he opened a No. 2 a/c in our branch in Lismore for the purpose of paying in</p>
