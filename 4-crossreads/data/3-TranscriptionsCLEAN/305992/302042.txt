 27.8.18 We have this day Count [blank] a very important Italian nobleman on board for luncheon with 3 ladies of the Italian society & the head British naval officers. The two generals that we brought over from Egypt this trip were Brig. General [blank[ & [blank]. The Italian labor that are used for the cargo loading are a very poor specimen of white workmen, in fact as slow & tackless as raw colored labor. The amount of work done by each gang is about the third of the amount that would be done by the Australian lumpers under the same conditions. This day a French troopship of Messageries Maritimes came in from Salonika full of French & British troops. It appears 50 miles off here she was attacked by a sub & the torpedoe missed her by a few feet. The sub then was bombed by a distroyer.
