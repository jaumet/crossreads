 Bertangl , Coisi , Rainnevill 16/7/16 along a white chalki road wind over high down . Poor countri with stunt crop and not veri mani hous in sight . Remind me veri much of some Australian landscap . The tower of Amien Cathedr is a landmark for mile and mile around . Approach Coisi the pretti countri start again . In Bertangl we pass sever littl crucifix set in the middl of a ring of tree like a Druidic grove . Just the other side of the villag there is a fine long avenu of parralel row of tree with a road run straight up to a chateau at the top .
