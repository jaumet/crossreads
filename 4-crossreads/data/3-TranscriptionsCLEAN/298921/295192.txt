  
 August, 1915 Monday 9 Full speed for Alexandria boat too shaky to write, so will wait. We are funny looking crowd & only 8 nurses & 4 doctors for the 1200, we buried a few who died last night, poor old Cox was left at Mitros Island - Major Reid & Nettleton's body we did not get. I am first class but lost my Kit. Should be back again with the Regiment in a month, Drs leaving the bit of Bomb in my thigh as it is a good fleshy part of the thigh - Of the 52 Reinf. I brought over only about 8 remain not wounded or killed.
