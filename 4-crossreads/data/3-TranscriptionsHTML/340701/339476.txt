<p>The Town Hall site.  I believe the Germans removed the Statue it supported.  I seen Jimmy Clarke [?] last Sunday on a disabled ambulance.  The Germans have a memorial in the Cemetery very close to a similar French one.  Fritz keeps shelling.  It has been decided to abandon this site.  One of the Boys J. Davis 2nd Batt. got very drunk on Monday &amp; kept us awake listening to an imaginary Bombardment.  On the way up we passed a kind of a chalk quarry called the Butte near Warlencourt.  Our fellows who were killed in the stunt on the 14/11/16 remained unburied until the day after we came to Bapaume.</p>
<p>Easter Sunday 8-4<br/>Fritz put a couple of duds right alongside the Huts we abandoned.  He also got 6 Men &amp; 20 Horses with another shell among the Transport</p>
