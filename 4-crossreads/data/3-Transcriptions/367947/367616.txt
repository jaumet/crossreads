<p>My dear Jack &amp; Clare<br/>It is quite a long time since I wrote you or received any from you. I think I wrote Clare after receiving her boshter cake &amp; I hope you got that alright. I never got Ede's pudding &amp; whether it fell through the mail-bag or not is a matter of conjecture. Perhaps they thought by the weight it was a bomb or shell &amp; heaved it out of the mail. I believe the maximum weight allowed though is 11 lbs. Still hard luck. It may turn up yet &amp; I am living in hopes.</p>
<p>Glad to see things are brightening again old cock. You are certainly having a very rough time of it. Everybody is but I think you are getting more than your share. However I am very pleased to see you are both as game as ever. Old pals I hope to be a bit of use when I got back &amp; whatever comes my way be sure you are the first for a "cut".</p>
<p>Poor old Al &amp; Ted have been up against it a lot. I must write them today. Both Ede &amp; Nell seem very happy. I often get letters from Morgan now. Vera &amp; Win &amp; Nell all take a turn. Suppose all the kids are quite grown up now &amp; swanky. Would like to see them. You've certainly got a crowd round you. How would a farm go? You'd have enough labor to work it.</p>
<p>I often get letters from the firm &amp; think if you care about it I could work the oracle for you when I get back to get fixed up in something good. So keep battling &amp; save those quarter shares of [Tatts?]. Hope you've hooked some more ere this.</p>
