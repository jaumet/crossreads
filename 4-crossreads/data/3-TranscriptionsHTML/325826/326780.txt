<p>6.  starting I think, in case there is anything to upset the plans.<br/>Just as you are getting it cold there occasionally now so we are getting it hot though only a few odd very hot days, the real heat is yet to come I think.<br/>Well dear ones I am going to close this now to be sure of its catching the mail &amp; if there should be any news later I will post on the chance of it reaching you for if I do somehow manage to catch the Medina this will be the last mail until I come myself, &amp; of course I will wire you when I get to Freemantle.  I mentioned to you didn't I that I shall be travelling through Cook's.  I have a sort of feeling that I'll be home soon, I don't know: it will be beautiful to see you all again, just heavenly &amp; I mean it, for this sort of life is as nearly the extreme opposite as I have yet had in my short pampered life though I know I might come miles nearer to it yet.  And after all I have a good comfortable home here &amp; a better one over there, and all the money I need, &amp; all my dear ones alive &amp; well &amp; am alive &amp; well myself- but it is mounting up so, I had better stop.<br/>Very very much love to you both &amp; thanks for your dear interesting letters, &amp; love to nice Jobber too,<br/>Your very loving daughter<br/>Olive.</p>
