it, so the boy's are having a pretty keen search for it you can bet, but I fancy he will never see it again for the mud is so deep & sloppy.This morning I hear that the reason of the heavy German bombardment last night was that they were withdrawing a Division & were sending them to the Somme"   I pity them, but if they thought this ruse would succeed they evidently were greatly mistaken for our guns were shelling away beyond the lines & on to their lines of communication, & in spite of the violence of Fritz's shelling he only succeeded in wounding 2 men in our Batt. But it is no good saying one thing & meaning another the Germans are not as good marksmen as the British they may have been better perhaps at the beginning of the war, but no, not now.
