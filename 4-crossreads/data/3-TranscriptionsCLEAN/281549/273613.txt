 Thursday the 15-2-17 The enemy exploded one of our ammunition & shell dumps. They dropped a bomb on to it from an aeroplane flying about 2,000 ft above it, The shock of the explosion was very severe & was felt quite plainly for miles away. I was inspected by the Doctor to-day & afterwards I was given a little more practice at Bomb throwing.  On the 16th there was very heavy bombardments at the front all night long, In the morning I had some more Bomb throwing practice. 
 On Sunday 18-2-17 I walked to the town of Albert & over the battlefields surrounding, to have a look at what the Hun had done. 
 The town of Albert is for the most part utterly ruined, The beautiful Cathedral which stands in the centre of the town is absolutely in ruins & past repair. The statue of the Maddona at the top of the spire is in the act of falling owing to the supports being shot away in places. French
