 Aout 28 Started out for rehearsal for big review tomorrow but had to return owing to state of weather. All the "Heads" appear to be very excited by the expected big review. 
 Aout 29 Was reviewed today by Sir Douglas Haig near Ponte [indecipherable]. The troops  taking part were composite 15th Brde under Brigdr. Elliot including 14th 4 Coy Eng's and 14th 7 [indecipherable] 8th Brgde. The day has been very disagreeable with heavy wind &amp; squalls of rain.
