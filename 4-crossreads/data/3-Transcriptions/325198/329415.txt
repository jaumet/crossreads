<p>19 Dec, 1916<br/>I was on out post, it was a cold night, but beautiful as every night is here, never the less my bivvy sheet was wringing wet with dew this morning.  It was a fool of a post we were on surrounded by hills, Abdul could creep right up to it unnoticed, while the horses make noise enough to make our where abouts known to a radius of half a mile at least.  The Transports with their limbers arrived last night Kicking up the deuce of a row &ndash; I was pleased to see Fiskies smiling old dial this morning as we came in past their camp.</p>
