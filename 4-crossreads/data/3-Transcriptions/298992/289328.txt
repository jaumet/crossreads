<p>shore trip. We got back to Town in time for lunch &amp; strolled into the G.O.H. (Grand Oriental Hotel). This is the Hotel of Colombo, &amp; a most beautiful place. Better than any Hotel in Sydney, I think. The Dining Room is a very large room &amp; one almost feels lost in it. We had a glorious feed (cost no object) &amp; then went to the Lounge Room of course for a smoke. In the afternoon, another ride we had. It is a curious sensation being pulled along by a black. They go at a good pace and often I thought I was going to be run down by a motor car or cart, but they are most skilful in evading vehicles &amp; pedestrians. The natives here are the worst beggars I have ever seen. They run for miles along side the rickshaw asking for money, saying, "Master, Master, we very poor man, you give me 1 cent" (6 cents make a penny) &amp; you absolutely can't send them away. But if you are soft hearted enough to give them one, in no time you will have half Colombo</p>
