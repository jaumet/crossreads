<p>The 1st Battalion has I believe been shifted back from the line somewhere.  I heard that Bob was in England with bad Eyes.  The Guns here are roaring all the time like a few [indecipherable] some of the shells roar like Railway Trains.  Met some of our mob today after some walking near Albert.</p>
<p>Saturday 29-7-16<br/>Our Squad was sent up to the line fusing Bombs last night.  I was among 10 who were left behind.  The Bombardment last night was awfully grand.  Every kind of Gun &amp; shell being employed.  The 7th  Brigade got an order to retire &amp; finished up among the Artillery.  It transpired later that there was a misunderstanding.  Birthday today  [40th]<br/>Sunday 30-7-16<br/>Attached to the Battalion 2 Platoon A Co. took up work today on a small tramway.  Another experience of Shrapnel fire.  There being at least a dozen casualties within 100 yds of our job but that is nothing here.  It did not look nice to see them carried away on Stretchers with Blood soaked clothing.  Had a swim today.  Tried to get a drink in Albert but could'nt.  One chap hit in the arse with a piece of spent Shrapnel. piece nearly red hot</p>
