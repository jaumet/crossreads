It is a sheltered Post and veranderd for a beat in wet weather. My hours were from 6 to 8, 12 to 2 last night and this morning from 6 to 8 and from 12 to 2<br/>[Shorthand transcribed as follows]  I wrote to my Uncle Gilmore today with [indecipherable] duty.

<p>Wednesday March 12. 1919.  (122)<br/>A cold wintry morning.  I am again in the educational workshop today making splints of mild steel. I wrote a long letter to Cis tonight telling her about my trip to Ireland.  6 Pages. I have a late pass tonight, but as it was a rough evening I did not go out. Men finishing guard are entitled to a late pass from 2 p.m. to 11.30.  The Education officer when he found out that I was doing guard wrote to the C.O.of No 2 Company protesting against it, &amp; asking that I taken off it &amp; all fatigues.<br/>Thursday March 13. 1919.   123<br/>A showery day. I was working all day in the workshop making leg irons for patients</p>
