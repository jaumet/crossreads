  
 April, 1915 Friday 16 Brigade day today fighting the New Zealanders, near Mataria & the old Suez Road. Personally I am better, but ever since the bullet went thru' my nose, the Doctors say I'll sniffle with my throat as I breath per mouth. Am feeling A.1. again. Myra Nyse very ill & I am told at Hospital she has only a fighting chance.
