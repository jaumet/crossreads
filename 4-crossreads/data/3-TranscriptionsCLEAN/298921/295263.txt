  
 October, 1915 Tuesday 19 Embarked on S.S. Franconia a 15000 Ton Cunard Liner a beautiful boat & most luxurious it is always such a contrast a soldiers life. We have about 2500 soldiers on board & lots of officers - about 90 I was surprised to meet among the 1st  [indecipherable] Reinf:- Shannon from Jerilderie who was with me in the Bushman the day I was shot. At the stern of the boat we have a 6" gun already for any submarine & we steer a Zig Zag course, & all hands are "told off to their respective boats"
