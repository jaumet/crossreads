<p>Waterloo</p>
<p>Behind a crest the Guard was massed<br/>The Guard!  Supreme hope &amp; supreme thought!<br/>"Go! give us the Guard", he cried <br/>And lancers, grenadiers with gaiters drill<br/>Dragoons who Rome had taken for legionaires<br/>Lifeguardsmen, cannoniers who trained the thunders<br/>Wearing black colbeck or Polish head-dress<br/>All, those of Friedland &amp; those of Rivolc<br/>Understanding they were going to die in this fete<br/>Saluted their God standing upright in the tempest<br/>Their mouths with one sole cry said "Live the Emperor!"<br/>Then with slow step, music at the head, without fury<br/>Tranquil, smiling at the English fire<br/>The Imperial Guard entered into the furnace</p>
<p>Alas, Napoleon leaning on his Guard<br/>Watched and as soon as they had debouched<br/>Under the black cannons spitting jets of sulphur<br/>Saw one after the other in this horrible whirlpool<br/>Meet these regiments of granite &amp; of steel<br/>As melts a cinder in the breath of a brazier<br/>They went their arms sloped, erect, grave stoic<br/>Not one returned.   Sleep, heroic dead!</p>
<p>Victor Hugo<br/>(The Punishment)</p>
