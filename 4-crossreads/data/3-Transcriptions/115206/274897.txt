<p>November 1918.<br/>Saturday 23</p>
<p>Southall. Hospital<br/>Spent a rather quiet morning. Did not go to the workshops as they were closed all day.<br/>Went across to O.s in the afternoon and stayed until I missed the last train from Wembley, thus missing the last from Paddington also. Had to walk to Ealing and a bus &ndash; militaire carried me almost the remaining portion of the journey. Felt pretty dicky too.</p>
