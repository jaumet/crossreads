 Jerusalem , where we were to entrain . It was a delight cool morn , and the most heaven sensat I have experienc for a long time , was to whisk along smooth , with the breez fan one 's face , and to realis that stabl , fatigu , dust , and everyth els that one grow to loath almost , by reason of their continu and monotoni , were all left behind for a few bless day .
