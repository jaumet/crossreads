Middleton, Adams and Hart. Spent an interesting time relating our experiences since we had parted. Saw the villagers weaving cloth by a hand loom. We also saw them winnowing grain. The grain that they grow here is dark coloured and the bread is likewise of a dark colour, baked in the form of a large scone.
