  
 Dar Mum, 
 March 9 1919 
 If you could not do 44 miles in a nice comfy seat, just imagine the soldiers doing 6 & 7 days on the floor of a cattle Truck or as Ellis & I did 19 Hours without a move hardly.  We felt as if the bones were cutting right through our flesh, but it is a good distance all the same. 
 I am glad that the horse is a good one.  Those animals are always getting something the matter with their knees or fetlocks.  Mrs White aught to be O.K.  Those things are only infectious to the part & do not effect the blood as a poison.  I should like to see young Nat Cohen but I have not His number or unit so although we might be next door to one another we cannot find one another's wherabouts. 
 I can see you "blowing your bags out" as we say in the army, as a Temperance Society President.  It would be a good place to start those concerns over here.  Great numbers of the poorer class in the country villages always make Sunday night a night out.  Mum & Dad & all the family get togged up & all set off for the Village Pub.  Pa gets several large ones with a handle & all have a drink.  Then Pa fills 'em up agen & even the Baby in the pram gets a dhrop o' the cratur to stop is squealing.  They are brought up on beer in this country. 
 Well, Mum, I've no more news just at
