  
 Thursday 29 March 1917 [28 March 1918] 1/2  day and met F. Blundell.  2.45 p.m. went Helouan by train, drove to tea gardens then walked by the Nile & watched the sunset, very grand, then walked (a mile & a half) back to Helouan with the full moon rising over the desert & shining down upon us as we talked of many things.  Talk of self knowledge, one touch of an arm & my long quiet is gone & fear, not of anyone but myself comes.  I who am always so sure of things and of one's control of sensations seem to be just ordinary woman after all. Coffee at Sault's 8.45 a.m., [p.m.] then back to 27th after a very enjoyable but also very astonishing afternoon.  It is time I think that we had more nursing to do else love might take hold of even "me" & that is not to be thought of.
