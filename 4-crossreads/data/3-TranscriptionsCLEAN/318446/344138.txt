Nov. 5th - Hod el SawartThis is our destination.  I don't know how to pronounce it - for the time being at any rate.Last night we had a heavy shower about 2 a.m.  There was dead silence everywhere until it stopped & then a perfect volley of facetious remarks were let off.  We had to do rather a hurried get-away this morning - having 15 miles to do & thus had no chance of drying our gear.I did not get wet last night but I have a very damp bed this evening I am afraid.This is quite a good place, it has been occupied before & the occupants have left a lot of their improvements here so we ought to be fairly comfortable as things go if we don't get too much wet weather.But nowadays the sky is very English & uncertain.
