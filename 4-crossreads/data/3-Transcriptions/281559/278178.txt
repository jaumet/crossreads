<p>&amp; from the top one enjoys a lovely view of the surrounding country : pictures at night &amp; then home :</p>
<p>Wednesday June 4th Capetown</p>
<p>Off to shore about 10 am &amp; had a roam round &amp; over the Pier : pictures at night &amp; in afternoon : Capetown is a decent little place but there are too many shades of colour among the people for my liking : the "boys" behaved fairly though the usual drunks were about : Table Mountain looks well when the clouds hang around the top &amp; forms a nice background for the town on the foreshore</p>
