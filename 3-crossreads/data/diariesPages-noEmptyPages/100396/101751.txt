I am not sorry I was not there to help. yesterday was an awful day. &mp; we could not see more than a few yards for dust. the trench diggers must have had a bad time I went up this morning watched the the other chaps clean out the sand which had blown in. we came home early.
All the boys have gone out again for an all night game. there is going to be a mimic battle the 2nd Batt being the attacking force. everything is going to be very up to date. I should like to be there. but I won't risk it in fact I don't know whether I won't get into a row for not being there. was supposed to see the doctor to see what he said about
