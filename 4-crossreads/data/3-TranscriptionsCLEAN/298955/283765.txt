6 - E deMwonder who was next, but like everything else it came to an end.We moved to a big chateau about a mile back, several being hit getting there & two or three killed at the chateau itself. In my letters to mother I have mentioned this chateau. Here remained some days.Whilst at Laverville about the 29th March I got a bit of shell shock. He had been shelling as usual blew in the side of a room with a 5.9 where 5 of our men were siting without injuring one of them. I was near a big building when over came a beauty landing just near me. Brought the whole structure down about my ears and burying me amongst the debris. I got such a shock I did not recover for a couple of weeks, and the 5th April stunt did not improve things.I was in hospital six weeks in France & having been marked unfit for further service was  evacuated to England where I arrived on the 1st of August.I spent 7 months in France & Belgium  was as far north as now the historic Ypres, although Fritz tried again & again to get this city they were never really successful in it
