 My darling Eddy, 
 I have just a few minutes before the mail closes. Have just received a lovely lot of letters, one from Mummie, telling me about my shares   &  about the painting of the house. Also a present from Mollie   &  Jess. from Geelong. A handkerchief from Charity. Two from Mrs   &  Misses Swindells of Marrumbeena. I think the slippers   &  soap must have been from Mrs Balfour   &  children. 
 Dorothy   &  I are both well. About five sisters are leaving on Transport in a few days for Australia, one Sister Hart, who has been my boas (Im in charge of Ward 6). Hope you will see her   &  give her a good time if you get the chance. Lots of love.  From Auntie Eadle
