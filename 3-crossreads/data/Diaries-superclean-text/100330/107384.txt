Saturday 21st July.
Having obtained a Pass to go into Poperinghe I left the Camp at 2 Pm as I felt inclined for a walk I took my time, the weather lately had been fine consequently the Roads were very dusty after 30 ? walking I arrived at the Village, as it was fairly hot I went into a small shop, for a cool Drink of Grenardine, a kind of French Syrup also a Brush up as my Boots Leggings were covered with white Dust after having a rest I made for the Militiary Baths to have a warm Bath a change of clothing. As I had not been there before I had to inquire my way gradually I found the place, on entering the yard there were a large number of Soldiers Haversacks Rifles piled in heaps while the owners were having a Bath, I went then stood behind a number waiting had a conversation with a Private who told me they had just come in from the Trenches for a clean up rest after being in the Front Trenches for 9 days without having a Wash my word they
