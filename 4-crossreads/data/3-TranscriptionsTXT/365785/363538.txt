 I went up to Alexandria for a few days last week with a Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wood who were boarding here.  Mer. got three days leave &amp; came too, except for the glimpse of the sea I like Cairo better but it is an interesting old city &amp; I loved our visit to the old Roman Fort built sometime early in the 15th Century.  I see Professor Petrie is lecturing in London on Egyptian Tools 8000 B.C., one finds it difficult to grasp. Well I must close.  Very kind regards to the Major &amp; with love for the Bairnies &amp; Self. 
 Yours affect. Hennie Fletcher
