The fight between an Indian, and a driver of R.H.A. battery as mentioned before, is creating a disturbance, I had to go to Y Battery wagon line and identify the man. However he turned out to be the wrong man. The guilty man is in B Battery R.H.A. We have here, landed last Tuesday the Ayrshire Yeomanry turned into infantry. They go to the trenches on Sunday.
