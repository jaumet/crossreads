morning a search was made for articles & although both McKenzie & Sheehan knew they were in my room yet ignorance of French prevented their saying so. So they were found in my room & as several things have been stolen they imagine they have discovered means of ingress & egress of theif.
About 2.30 pm Town Major receives a note from Maire & of course as interpreter I accompany him but no one knows what it is about. On entering the Tannerie which is where Maire spends all his time 2 women, the Maire & a surly looking man all commence speaking at the same time & had my interpreting powers to the utmost
Soon I gave up interpreting & listened & find that I am the subject of all this disturbance. I am now an excellent judge of French temperant & never make a mistake. In the end I am invited to take wine with the ladies & am shown all their treasure trove & post cards. Their front room is chaos. Birds of paradise & foxes and several good specimens are on floor & in all sorts of corners.
However I spend a pleasant afternoon & leave the best of friends with an invitation to see them again
