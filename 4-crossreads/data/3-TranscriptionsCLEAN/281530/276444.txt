  
 Treux - Ville-sur-Ancre Two of our planes attacked them & their observers parachuted down. All the was left of a couple of balloons was a spiral of black smoke in the air. Treux has been a pretty little place and owned a nice Chateau set in thickly wooded grounds running down to the heavily timbered river and enclosed by a very neat and trim hedge. We went into this Chateau and found it partially shell wrecked and in a deplorable condition owing to the damage done by looting troops. Valuable knick-knacks and belongings lay strewn all over the place and books clothes and furniture  were lying in one huge mess. Walked through the village and found Lanyon at D.G.H.Q. in a fairly good cellar on the outskirts. We walked out into the trenches in front and saw the men mostly asleep in their little bivouacs
