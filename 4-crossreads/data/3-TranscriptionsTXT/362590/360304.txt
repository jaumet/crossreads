 2. We are now in the sandy desert about 8 miles from the Canal &amp; about 12 from Ismalia. Mt Battn is the Brigade Reserve at present, 17th 18th &amp; 19th forming a line in front about 2 miles from us &amp; Gen Holmes has been good enough to name one of the Positions Kurrajong Heights, knowing that I was associated with that part of the country at home, a compliment which I very much appreciate. 
 We got 150 of our reinforcements at Tel el Kebn but are still below our war strength considerably. I am glad to say the health of the Battn a very good turn[?], but we have not yet any of sick officers back yet with the exception of yr son &amp; Major Jenkins, would have heard of our great loss in Majors Jenkins, Utter &amp; Harcus, one shell caught the three of them on their way to inspect the lines at Russel  Tops which they were to take over the next day from the 7th Brigade. 
 This was the greatest shock I have yet had &amp; the loss to the Battn is almost irreparable, in Utter I had a giant, he was brave to the utmost, Loyal to the core &amp; I never saw an officer work harder. I have recommended him, from the 20th, for the decoration of "Legion of Honour". 
 I sent you a cable re our comforts arriving, the men had the time of their lives, &amp; are really most grateful to the Com'e [Committee] for the great amt of work they must have put into the business. 
 I note you say yr other son is in camp &amp; that you wd like him to join the 20th. If he is near us at any time a transfer can easily be arranged &amp; I will tell yr son at this line to look out for him. 
 The weather here is very cold &amp; we have heavy showers blowing over, not at all what we expected in the desert, but I expect the scene will soon change. 
 I am glad to hear a good report on my wife's work, in connection with the Com'e, in her letters she seems to be most interested in what she is doing &amp; I am very glad for her own sake as it keeps her mind occupied instead of sitting down &amp; thinking. 
 I think I have exhausted my stock of news. You will please give my thanks
