13walk down to Jitee & along the sea front. The child like prank that grown ups can play reflect this light tempered race, eg a man tries to overturn a little shelter where his mother-in-law & wife is sitting. Another man rolls his wife over in the sand & both find it funny I should find it uncomfortable but they dont seem to mind.
Men & women take advantage of the evening to go for a stroll but no one dresses. They go as they are when the idea comes into their head. And the girls seem proud of their lovers even though he be in working drabs & they seem to get a lot of pleasure out of their evening stroll.
I saw one boat come alongside quay & it showed that Frenchmen were never made to handle boats. 2 well dressed girls & their mother at top of wharf are amused & the sailors exchange remarks with them as if they were old friends. There is no resentment & no forwardness. It all seems natural here.
At the club all are English & I am isolated. I now never speak to an Englishmen unless he first speaks & then I sometimes only answer rarely. My dislike for the average Englishman is daily increasing
