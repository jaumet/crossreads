 Reveille at 5.30 Stables as usual then the usual clean up after break we drew chaff and oats for the first time. Orders came out that our strength is to be made up by drawing reinforcements from the Regts so 18 men are to report here at 9.30 tomorrow morning. A mail arrives at 5.30 but the beggars wont sort it. Rumors afloat that we are off soon &amp; we hope same are true. Two Regs of yeomentry arrive &amp; are quartered in Kasr-el Nil barracks 18 more regs are at Alex. Our fourth reinforcement arrives per Chas Relynack. Filled in the day by playing cricket &amp; watching "willies" which are pretty prevalent lately owing to the absence of wind. Mail was sorted after all at 9.00 Bed 10 pm

 Revielle at 5.30 N.C.Os all on the doctor I got 8 letters last night 3 from home &amp; 1 from Nell but there should be an extra mail but its not come to hand yet. Our reinforcements arrive &amp; tents are erected straight away. After lunch we got our   marching orders   at last. We are to go next week (dismounted) motors &amp; push [indecipherable] are to accompany the troop, later the news came through that 6 men are to be taken on the strength &amp; troop to retain horses so that's not so bad.
