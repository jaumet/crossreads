<p>66.  October 19<br/>Related in the Huts.<br/>England:  an estaminet:  Australians and Americans.<br/>"Walt:  I don't think much of the god-damned beer, and its [indecipherable] enough!"<br/>"No! it is been waiting three years on the counter!"<br/>And another little pleasantry resulted.</p>
<p>67.<br/>'The Letters of a Soldier', I have finished reading them this morning.  It is a book as lovely and wounderful as an old poem.  A book that should go singing of the "rich dead" down all the years to come.</p>
<p>I have marked many paragraphs&hellip;. and they are all to my Mother, to take to her some feelings I haven't well written.</p>
<p>68.</p>
<p>The Mother, P. Pearse<br/>I do not grudge them:  Lord, I do not grudge,<br/>My two strong sons that I have seen go out<br/>To break their strength and die, they &amp; a few,<br/>In bloody protest for a glorious thing,<br/>They shall be spoken of among their people<br/>The generations shall remember them<br/>And call them blessed:<br/>But I will speak their names to my own heart<br/>In the long nights:<br/>The little names that were familiar once<br/>Round my dead hearth.<br/>Lord, thou art hard on Mothers:<br/>We suffer in their coming and their going:<br/>And tho' I grudge them not, I weary, weary,<br/>Of the long sorrow &ndash; and yet I have my joy,<br/>My sons were faithful, and they fought.</p>
<p>October 19</p>
<p>Oh Lovely Head, P. Pearse<br/>Oh lovely head of the woman that I loved,<br/>In the middle of the night I remember thee:<br/>But reality returns with the sun's whitening,<br/>Alas, that the slender worm gnaws thee to-night.</p>
<p>Beloved voice, that wast low and beautiful,<br/>Is it true that I heard thee in my slumbers!<br/>Or is the knowledge true that tortures me?<br/>My grief, the tomb hath no sound or voice?</p>
