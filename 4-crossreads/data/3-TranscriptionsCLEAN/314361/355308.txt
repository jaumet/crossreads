Monday, Tuesday & Friday, had my first lesson last Monday. Have discontinued the lessons at Heliopolis.

Reveille in the school goes at 5.30 fall in is at 6.30 till 8.30, second parade 10 Am till 1 Pm Third parade 2.15 till 4.15, if lamps practice, we do not fall in till 3pm and continue to 5.30 then tea. Have taken some very fine photos this last week. I have started developing myself in a Brownie tank which was given me.  it it  I get better results & does not cost half. A film (No2 Energuette ) left in Cairo or Heliopolis cost 3 piastres, with the tank it only cost about 1 pt. Wednesday 15th Dec. Evening This afternoon I went over to my company
