<p>we are all at home again- a re-united family.<br/>Yesterday I posted you out three copies of the "Daily Mirror," one of London's Daily.  In the <strike>centre</strike> front page was a photo of Wally taken in bed but they had mucked the name up &amp; made "Whitehouse" out of it.<br/>And now, Daddy, I must close, With love to you all at home, &amp; with my best love and birthday wishes to yourself,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
