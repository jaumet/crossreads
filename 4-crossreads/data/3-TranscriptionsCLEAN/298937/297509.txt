  
 Cont. from 1915 diary 
 New Years Day in hospital.  Both Xmas & N.Y. were very enjoyable days in hospital.  Saw optician who advised me very strongly not to go to the front again, but saw also Capt. [indecipherable], & after chat with him thought I would like to go to the boys again.  Told optician so & he put no impediment in my way but told me I was unwise. Discharged from Hosp. to Base Camp at Giza on Sunday 2nd Jan. Met Land there the first night in peculiar circumstances. Had just settled down to sleep
