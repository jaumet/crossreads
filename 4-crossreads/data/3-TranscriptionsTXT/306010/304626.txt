 The heavy boom of big gun fire from the British front can clearly be heard. We are only about 50 miles from the trenches &amp; believe the Boches occasionally send a taube over in our direction for bomb dropping practice (at the expense of the people beneath). I have seen both aeroplanes &amp; airships cruising round yesterday &amp; today but they are British &amp; French machines keeping their eyes open for hostile aircraft and also any submarines that might come stealing up the channel. The place we are occupying is a hospital of tents formerly run by No.5 British Conval. Depot, we are about a kilom&egrave;tre from Wimereux railway station, 3 kilom. from Boulonge and a few hundred yards from the cliffs from where the English coast can be seen. We are surrounded by British General &amp; Stationary Hospitals (&amp; a Canadian) &ndash; about a dozen in all.
