<p>9.9.16 Saturday. Half hearted gas alarm last night but nothing occurred. Usual routine to-day on the saw and we worked hard all day. Letters from Glad, Bill &amp;  3 from Melv. Since writing last nothing of importance has occurred. Usual routine on the saw and in the few spare moments I have enjoyed I have brought my correspondence up to date. 8 hours a day every day of the week soon tell and I have been pretty tired. The only spell was one of about 1 &frac12; hours when the other engine broke down and the other sawyers gave us a spell.<br/>25.9.16 This evening a battle plane had to descend quite close to our yard here with her propeller smashed a bit probably by shrapnel and she flew off next day at 12. Heard of Blackburn's V.C. To-day 27.9.16 a Taube flew right over us with shrapnel all around and patrolled inland for quite an hour and a half. On her return she was pursued by 12 of our planes but easily got away right home. To-night I got a bike and rode to Poperinghe and had quite an enjoyable evening. Bought toothpaste, a watch for 25f and some A.T.Q. Lost my way for a while coming home but then was directed and had some beef tea with my cooker from Sarah and read the Royal with a pipe before retiring.<br/>28.9.16 Usual routine. Last night one saw was working from 6 to 19 and to-night both are going and it is now 10.45. Parcel from Auntie Sarah containing biscuits chocolates and fruit &amp; papers and mouldy apples. One from home, pillow, socks, shirt, chocolates nuts . Feel very tired.<br/>8.10.16 Rumours to-day of going back to the Somme. Pretty correct all leave cancelled to England.<br/>9.10.16 Nothing unusual happened except definite news to move for the third brigade.<br/>10.10.16 Expected to move to-day but went on as usual with our work and the same on the 11th.<br/>11.10.16 Did very little work and I ran up on the bike and got my big bundle of washing. The rest of the section came in from the front at about 12 last night and we have orders to leave on the 12th at 9.30.</p>
