We don't talk about it because they say the fleet would laugh  -  You should have seen the way the men entered into the idea of slaying someone even though their failure must cause our destruction  -  Fancy now we'd go up with a shell into an oil ship & 8 war heads full of gun cotton forward  -  Well, well, it's a funny queer game  -2 pm  -  Not so bad  -  We are in the thick of things  -  Raboul has not surrendered & and that is why all the German flags are up  -  At 11 am I went off to the Parramatta with Patterson & Herbert  -  I met Warren - the Commander  -  Everybody was dressed anyhow  -  We had gin cocktails & heard that there had been fighting at Kagakaul a wireless station  -  Commander Elwell dead & Surgeon Pockley also  -  Native police led by German officers had mined & entrenched the place  -  It was captured & destroyed  -  Kagakaul was evidently the place the fleet were sending reinforcements to yesterday  -  There has been fighting at Herbert Hohe but we've no details  -  The Admiral hadn't touched Raboul  -  We left the Parramatta & got back  -  Presently in came the Melbourne, the boat R & I were on in Brisbane  -  She anchored - then the Aorangi came in ditto  -  Then our 2 submarines hove in sight - then some colliers & then the flag ship - Australia  -  The Australia lies anchored 5 cables (1C= 600 feet) in front of us  -  We lie between her and the shore line about opposite the centre of Raboul  -
