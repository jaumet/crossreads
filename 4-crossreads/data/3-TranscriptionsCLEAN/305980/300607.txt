 18:  After many attempts, the doctor allowed me up for a few hours on the balcony & am feeling much better though very thin & weak.  Buying my food from Cairo & since my admission, have spent about #163;5 to keep myself alive, the food is just as bad as ever. 
 22:  Asked to be discharged, the doctor letting me go at last, not even feeling my pulse & my temperature was exactly 100.  Glad to get out on good food & can treat myself better than the doctor has done to me.  Had a hard job to pass the C.O. who said I looked too weak, but let me out on condition I went to the seaside at Alex. for fourteen days & put me on the A.I.F. sick allowance of 4/- per day. Put up at Rossmore House. 
 24:  Went to Alexandria, stayed at the Windsor, near the sea, plenty of surfing & feeling first rate now. 
 26:  Went to Nouzah Gardens had a good day with some French people of Alex., who made us very welcome in their homes.  Amusements poor in Alex., not an English show - except pictures in the town.
