<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It has meant hard work for us all, it has meant much danger too, but comparatively speaking our casualties have been light, and though others who have shown to the enemy a front less bold, who were less daring in their seizure of positions of vantage, have paid heavily, our cost has been much less beacuse of our strength.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some day I&#39;ll write of incidents in this eventful career of ours, but just at present am too busy for any lengthy epistles, so I&#39;ll shut off now with every jolly good wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,</p>
