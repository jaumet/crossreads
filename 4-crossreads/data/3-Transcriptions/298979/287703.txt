<p>colors of the 4th battn said Hulloa! Were you at Lone Pine?<br/>Surlily the man answered. Yes!<br/>I suppose said the officer You are very glad to rejoin your battalion in France again?<br/>No! I'm Not!! gruffly replied the man.<br/>Are you rejoining now? said the officer,<br/>Yes! Worse luck!!! responded the man.<br/>Well! Good bye boys! and the officer passed along.<br/>Not a man spoke but each curiously watched the officer as he walked away. Nothing was said, not a man moved or saluted, but stood or sat in sullen silence.</p>
<p>The situation was so peculiar that the Sentry from the far side of the road crossed to speak with a man, (in his battalion), who had been in conversation with the man belonging to the 4th battn when the officer stopped.</p>
<p>That man was certainly an officer of some importance and standing, although he did not appear to be very welcome to you fellows? Who was he?<br/>Oh! him! replied the man, That was B[dash]d, the S[dash]l of A[dash]e &amp; [dash] [dash] dash] finishing his sentence with an epithet most offensive.<br/>You surprise me! said the Sentry, but how did he earn such a reputation especially as he was so well thought of in Gallipoli?<br/>In Gallipoli, said the man, he was alright! but he is no good here!!<br/>That is a big thing to say! said the Sentry.<br/>Oh well! said the man, ask the Second Division!!</p>
<p>Moving away to some of the other men &amp; saying Did you know that, that officer was Birdwood?<br/>Yes! would be the reply &amp; certainly amongst a good many of the men of that draft, the expression used to designate him seemed to be common, which was a big shock, &amp; showed the Sentry, while in England, how little the papers knew.</p>
<p>After waiting about an hour &amp; a half the men were moved up to a hut where they camped for the night.</p>
<p>While walking along the duckboards</p>
