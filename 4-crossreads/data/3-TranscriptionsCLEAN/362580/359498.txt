Sister Weiss invited us to an afternoon & we had a lovely time Dorothy sang but I was sorry I did not hear her, because I had to leave at 5 p.m. - had another engagement for afternoon tea.  We don't have afternoon tea here until about 5 or 6 p.m., so you see I shall be quite continental when I return.
We have had some lovely donkey rides down here - wish I could bring one home - Eddy would love one - They are very clever & not at all silly, so I wont mind people calling me a donkey.
Last Tuesday we had a delightful day.  Left early in the morning for "Aboukir" another Rest Home on the coast - which has a Noah's Ark (that is supposed to have been in the Crimean War) where some of the sisters sleep - we were round over to it & stayed there about one hour, watched some fine swimming - displayed by the nurses - others got into goun & were rowed to the shallow water & are taught swimming there.  None of us went in for a swim - returned to the beach, got donkeys &
