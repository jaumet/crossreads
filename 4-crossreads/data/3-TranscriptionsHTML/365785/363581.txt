<p>The Desert<br/>Egypt<br/>5/12/16</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Read,<br/>It had to be only a P.C. last time in return for the parcel as we were just on the eve of a shift out further.  Now we are settled once more (temporarily).  Nothing doing, weather beautiful, everybody well &amp; I have really told you all the news unless I tell you something that will be severely delt with by the censor.  It is truly hard to write interesting letters from here as most of the interesting things one sees are marked as sacred &amp; one is forbidden to write about them.  Did you hear that a while back a Taube flew over Cairo &amp; dropped several bombs? One landed in front of the Singer buildings so if you had been in your old flat you would probably have been severely disturbed.  No great damage was done however although the sensations of the people round about could not have been very pleasant.</p>
