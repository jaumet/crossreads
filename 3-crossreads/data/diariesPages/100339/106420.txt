WAR MEMORIAL COMES TO SYDNEY

[See image for photograph]

The scene is Bullecourt, World War I. Tanks have already tried to break through the German wire, but have failed. Now the 4th Australian Division is attempting an impossible job.

This is one of the many displays which some 250,000 Australians see in the Australian War Memorial at Canberra each year.

But many thousands of other Australians are not able to visit Canberra. So now the memorial, on film, is coming to them.

The Memorial authorities will show a two and a half hour film programme at Sydney Town Hall on February 21 and 22 at 8 p.m. It will include "The Australian War Memorial", an excellent colour film produced recently by the Commonwealth Film Unit.
