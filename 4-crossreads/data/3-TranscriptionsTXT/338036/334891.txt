 [8th April contd] During the afternoon we received the very sad news of the death of 3 of our boys and later the bodies put all our doubts to the wind.  They were Sgt Gus Dyer, Ernie Porter &amp; Harry Bridson.  Both the latter have brothers in the Amb.  It appears that were taking up the rations to Advance Dressing Station when a shell landed practically on them &amp; cut them up horibly.  I saw the bodies &amp; they were a sight. Previous ration carts had had narrow escapes &amp; it was wondered that the sending of rations during daylight still continued.  Gas drill later. 
 Monday 9th  [April] Sleet falling &amp; snowing &amp; cold all day.
