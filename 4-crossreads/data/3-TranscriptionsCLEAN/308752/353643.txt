I noticed that the Palace was being used, as a hospital for soldiers. From the Palace we noticed a fine building standing out alone amidst the city, so of course set out to make an inspection. It turned out to be the Palais de Justice, or Law Courts. Really it was a most magnificent piece of architecture. Said to be the largest law courts in Europe. The structure contains numberless passages 8 court yards, 27 large sessions halls, and about 200 rooms. You can guess from this what a fine building it must be. There are nearly 700 steps to be climbed to reach the tower; but, after walking round Brussels all day we did not feel much inclined for climbing steps. However we obtained a fine view of the town from the terrace. Words cannot describe the scene, the panorama was magnificent. Quite close to the Law Courts is the Grande Place, a large market place, and also the famous square of Brussels.  On one side stands the Hotel de Ville or Town Hall.  It is a quaint & inspiring building & dates right back from the 15th Century. Right opposite on the North side of the Grande Place, stands another very old building called La Maison du Roi.
