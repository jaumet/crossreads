<p>25 July, 1916<br/>A.G.H. Cairo<br/>What a world it is.  here am I stuck in a hospital ward in Cairo &amp; its much the same as being in prison.  true I can walk about but always between high walls &amp; wearing these pyjamas all the time heightens the effect.  There is nothing to do but read.  The nurses are kindness itself &amp; one gets every attention, there is plenty to eat &amp; drink &amp; to day we all got paid 10/- each so I expect that I should be dubbed an ungrateful person indeed if I had a growl<br/>My hands are getting well slowly &amp; I was able to scribble a few lines home &amp; now make an entry in here I must write up the back stuff a bit but not now, Im not in the humour &amp; the hand is'nt too good yet &ndash; I got a long letter to write to Vic, reckon I ought to blow him up   [indecipherable] him taking notice of Madge,  She's--------ed</p>
