France 16.12.16Dear father,
We got orders last night to shift up & join the battalion today, so our chances of being out of the trenches for Christmas are very remote.
The adjutant has just sent for me so I will have to go.
I saw Caesar in Wentworth hospital London before leaving, & had a day in town with him.  He has a slight touch of pneumonia but is quite right again now.
Give Dorothy & mother a kiss from me, & tell them not to worry.
Your loving sonKeith
