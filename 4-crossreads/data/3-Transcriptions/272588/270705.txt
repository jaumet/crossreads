<p>Sunday 12 May<br/>Beautiful day.<br/>This evening we went into the line to the right of where we were last &amp; took over an R.A.P. at Strazeele station about five hundred yards from our front line.  We evacuate along the railway line on trucks line 4 feet 8&frac12;" gauge. Things appear to be quiet here &amp; so far shell fire has been practically nil. Three patients came in last night, two of whom died here. The country about which I know well is as flat as a pancake &amp; the Boche has observation from Mont de Merris. We are living in a cellar of the house of a merchant of pommes des terres. Our first billet in France is only a couple of hundred yards north of here.</p>
<p>Monday 13 May<br/>Wet to-day but very quiet on the front, &amp; in spite of changing over, we had no carries.</p>
