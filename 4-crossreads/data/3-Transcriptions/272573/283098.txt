<p>destroying a splendid bed of lettuces.</p>
<p>May 23rd. Tues.<br/>Put in charge to fix up 'D' Ward.</p>
<p>May 24th. Wed.<br/>Troops that are passing through the village from north to south of the line are selling curios or soveniers of their fights. German Helmets, Bells, Revolvers, etc.</p>
<p>May 26th Frid.<br/>Saw a remarkable instance of how a Steel Helmet saved a soldier's life. Their was only a slight wound on his head but if he had not had had the helmet on, his skull would probably have been shattered by a bullet</p>
<p>Received the Anzac Book which I had ordered and paid for in Egypt. It is a very interesting and good souvenier of our stay on the Anzac position. Every word and every picture of it seems to be familiar to me.</p>
<p>After having a walk along the road outside of the village we dropped in to Madame Couzet's to have a cup of coffee. I noticed that Madame tonight seemed a bit worried and on making inquiries I learned that the village people have been warned to clear out of the village within a month or remain at their own risk.</p>
<p>May 28th. Sun.<br/>Had the afternoon off. Walked out to Sailly. Sur. Lye.</p>
