<p>Slept out all night &amp; the first thing I knew this morning was the niggers washing down the decks without warning us. Drew feed from No 1 for our gees then was off till dinner, no soup now for we are on tropical diet on account of fever. I met Guy Booth today who used to drive Mountjoys coach at home &amp; had quite an interesting chat to him concerning the celebrities of home. 4 Oclock a fire alarm took place but nothing unusual took place [indecipherable] alarm of enemy in sight at 8 pm when every man had to stand to his [indecipherable] await further orders. Roy Mathers discharged from hospital &amp; Bob Powers taken in poor old Toby is progressing slowly. Joe Gillies horse (Blitzen) bit me a beauty on the right arm this afternoon. Concert is to take place as arranged at 5.30 &amp; expect great things for talent is good this time &amp; an orchestra has been formed called the "Karroosel" a very appropriate name too.</p>
