<p>to fire one shot as any ordinary quick pull will fire at least 2 shots, every company at the front has four of these guns, one to every platoon.  A platoon now a days is a complete fighting unit by itself, it consists of 4 sections, No. 1 section consist of riflemen, No. 2 section bombers, No. 3 section rifle grenadiers, No. 4 section Lewis gunners.  Although these men belong to these sections &amp; have the special equipment &amp; amunition for such they all carry their rifle as well but the riflemen do the chief part of charging bayonet work, etc. &amp; striking.  We are going to get into this section if we can but every infantry man is trained here to take his place in what ever section required.</p>
