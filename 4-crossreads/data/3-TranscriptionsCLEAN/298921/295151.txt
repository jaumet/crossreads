  
 June, 1915 Tuesday 29 5th Reinforcements under Major Mills Marched in tonight fresh off the Boat & full of wonder as we were at the strange sights of Cairo, we have the 6th & 7th Reinforcements out on the road. Hence our turn may soon come now to move off. What do people think of the "Gas" business, we might be Rabbits & a Carbon Fumigator used! Its not playing the game, but the men from the Back country won't forget when their time comes.
