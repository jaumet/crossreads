Part II hope you'll get this all right  -  You've a narrative outline of events & what I've seen & done  -Kiss the children  -  I'm always thinking about you & the peaceful Glen Innes home  -  The contrast to all this grim armament is striking but this armament is the sole precursor & the bedrock mainstay of peaceful homes thro our empire  -  There is but one feeling here & that is that Germany has got to be thoroughly thrashed - at any cost - as one old sailor said when we hoisted the white ensign on our little launch "That'll take a lot of hauling down Sir  - "
We've no news of Belgium  -  We did here the Germans were near - Paris - 12 miles off  -  We're going to stop here I fancy & our AE1 & 2 mount guard  -  This harbor is I am convinced the crater of an enormous volcano - not extinct for a fire can be seen & smoke on a hill top  -  Its huge & its lips are like a bowl  -
Much Love  -  Fred  -
