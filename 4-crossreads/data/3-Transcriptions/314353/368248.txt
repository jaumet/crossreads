<p>November 12<br/>122.<br/>Back from a short enjoyed route march.  Reniscure a rather pretty little village &ndash; its square tent filled and the tracks duckboarded&hellip; a charming little church and a fine tree hedge around it and its clustering cemetry&hellip;  One chateau &ndash; about 150 yards from the roadway &ndash; a high building of apse ends with two small knobby turrets breaking the highly pitched roof of slate&hellip; the avenue of old trees finely coloured &ndash; black skeletons and brown green patching of dying leaves.</p>
<p>A clear lovely early spring day and a warm sun.</p>
<p>123.<br/>Two Ballets suggested themselves to my mind coming back&hellip; a Ballet of Autumn &ndash; hoary subject &ndash; its setting from the winding climbing road to Cassel&hellip; just on one of its abrupt turns a little back from the road, a white stucco formal chateau, somewhat suggestive of Georgian architecture by the high iron gateways a great weeping branching tree, black, and long festoons of rich red brown and madder leaves&hellip;. the chateau patch of white through the vivid colour.  As we passed down the road slowly hobbled an old little woman, wrapt in a great black shawl and her face lovely as an old miniature.</p>
<p>November 12, 13<br/>Then a Ballet of Madness, or Fear.  A Darkened setting &ndash; the ballet in a twilight, a living freize of semi nude figures writhing fantastically as carvings of a Buddhist Temple.</p>
<p>Evening:  early, but turning in.  This afternoon to Reniscure villiage with Frank S. . The old stone chateau mentioned this morning inspected from end of avenue where it opens to the gardens in front&hellip;then we learnt it was 1st Divy Hqs. .. Met Les Ford and Johnny, they from the second chateau&hellip; a fine old brick building.. made a sketch of it, and then some rough outlines of the perfect little tracery windows of the church.. closed so no chance of the seeing of its inside.</p>
<p>To move off tomorrow.. stay here owing to road congestion, wether per foot, or by buss not known.  Latest is though we are to buss the whole way &ndash; to somewhere by Abbeville, the transport to take the distance by stages&hellip;if Buss must try again for an outside seat.</p>
<p>ECUIRE/ November 13<br/>124.<br/>Somewhere in Picardy, about 20 miles from Boulogne.</p>
<p>Reniscure left early this morning &ndash; 7.30, and on arriving here after a full day of marching, the whole Ambulance at 4.30&hellip;</p>
<p>Billeted in a Farmhouse in a valley of autumn&hellip; and mud.</p>
