<p>A typical incident occurred yesterday.   For years all arriving prisoners are locked in the strafe barrack till required for interrogation purposes.</p>
<p>Fri. 25th (cont.)<br/>No blankets have been supplied, even in winter.   Now that it looks as though Foch is on the move. &ndash; a box of blankets was <u>yesterday</u> placed in the "Strafe" barrack.   After 4 years!   Speech (A)</p>
<p>Mon 28th.<br/>Food is very scarce in the lager &ndash; no packets again for 14 days.</p>
<p>Mc "en relief" last week, I go on today.   (Sounds like entering the workhouse, doesn't it?   When one has not received a packet for 14 days the Relief committee dole out weekly grants till the packets again resume arriving.   All sorts of scandal about the committee dining on 6 courses &amp; feeding German "lydies", of course.)</p>
