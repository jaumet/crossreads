 Friday 18th May. Sea  calmer. Heavy swell. Ship rolling heavily. "Banalla" going rails under. Towards evening the weather is finer. Today we were detailed tour lifeboats.

Church Service at 10a.m  C.of E.Hymns Onward Christian Soldiers. Lead Kindly Light. Fight the Good Fight. Hymn for Those at Sea. God Save The  King. Afternoon Service by Y.M.C.A. Rep, who is a very fine fellow. Rock of Ages, Lead Kindly Light. Oh God, our help in ages past, etc, sung by all hands. At noon we changed our course and steamed north.
