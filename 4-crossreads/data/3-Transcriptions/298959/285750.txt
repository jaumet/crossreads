Xxx Afternoon very cold, sea rising again. Convoy takes former stations. Salt water entered fresh water tanks and spoilt a good deal of the drinking water.

Heavy sea running. Convoy shipping seas forward and at times rolling heavily.Judging by the other vessels our ship is easily the best sea boat. Weather clearing again toward sunset with sea going down. Less sea sickness aboard.<br/>Thursday 17th May. Sea  again getting rough with wind blowing very strong. Toward midday heavy sea running. Benalla close astern shipping green seas continually &amp;  rolling heavily. At times she ships three seas in succession and we can plainly see the water pouring off her decks.
