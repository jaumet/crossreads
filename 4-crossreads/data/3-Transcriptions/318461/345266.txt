<p>the Village taken last night was Builingcourt. Very Hot again &amp; plenty of artillery fighting. off for more Rations,.<br/>Pay 13/1 &pound;25.7.0</p>
<p>Sunday 13/5/17.<br/>Another exciting night again but not so full of danger as privously, got over for the Rations earlier so could see where we were going &amp; it's the better Plan. Had to take some up to Head Quarters later on in the dark how I hate the dark my eyes are not as good as they were &amp; am always in a funk that I shall fall down some deep shell hole &amp; get hurt one doesn't want that sort of hurt over here. Got back safely soaked through with sweat, very sultry weather.</p>
<p>Go out to the supports tonight. Fritz counter attacked again this morning about 3 don't know how he got on this time. The Scotties took 400 Prisoners yesterday &amp; the 15th Brigade 157.</p>
<p>The Bombardment was terrific while it lasted but everything is quietened down a bit now, always does when our Planes get up there are about 30 up now &amp; they have the hun bluffed, scarcely ever see any of his. Some rumours that fritz is evacuating in front of us.<br/>Pay14/1 &pound;25.8.0</p>
<p>Monday 14/5/17.<br/>came out last night &amp; not likely to forget it. Huns must have  got wind of it &amp; an infernal Bombardment started which beat anything yet &amp; that's saying something, our Posi was shelled for 2 or 3 hours &amp; it was quite dark &amp; Raining when we got away, with that creepy feeling you get when the shells come behind you. Got here Norreil at about 11.30. &amp; the shells were bursting all round this place owing to Batteries being near. What a  night it was I have had my fill &amp; wish I was out of it, have had 6 days &amp; nights</p>
