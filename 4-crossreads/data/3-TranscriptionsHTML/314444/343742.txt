<p>Dear Mrs. Hill,</p>
<p>It is my sad duty to inform you of the death of your son, Sergt. Hill, 874, 19th Batt. 2nd Aust. Div. on Saturday Sept. 22nd at 2.10 p.m. I had worship with him a short time before he died and he asked me to write to you giving his love. He was seriously wounded but everything possible was done for his comfort and recovery.<br/>The end was very peaceful &ndash; he will be buried in the Lejssenhoek Cemetery, Belgium. You have my deep sympathy and I pray that God may comfort you in your hour of sorrow.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>A. H. Devon<br/>(Capt. Chap).</p>
