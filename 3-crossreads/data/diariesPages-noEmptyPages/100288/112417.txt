Sunday 20/2/16
Church parade 9 AM. Service conducted on 31st Btn parade ground by Capt Chaplain Cranston. Had pleasant game of tennis with a few of the members of the 20th A.S.C. who have rackets; the court adjoins our camp although in fairly good condition, must have been laid some years back. Severe wind dust
