<p>on Bir el Abd &ndash; about 2&frac12; miles off killing 4-5.  Nothing doing today.  I have built me an house of palm sticks &amp; sand bags &amp; am now very comfortable, have a fire outside the door every night and a beautiful washing basin hollowed out of solid Limestone &ndash; as much as I can lift and Lord knows how old &ndash; I picked it up close here &ndash; one finds all sorts of queer remnants of pottery &amp; such like on the desert.</p>
