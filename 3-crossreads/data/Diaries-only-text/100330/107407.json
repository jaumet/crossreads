booming now again. As soon as my Mate returns from the Hospital I intend taking a day off going up the line to Eypes to have a look around. Our Colours arrived from London on Saturday Evening as I had taken several orders for the Boys supplied them, there will be no more wanted although I still have 12 sets on order, we hoped to get the numbers of our Coy (59) but they did not come so I have got a lot in Poperinghe sold them to the Boys, altogether I have sold 15 sets at 1 Franc 2d each, they cost me 1 Franc each, that is 5d for the Colours 5d for the number so I make 4d on each set, also I got a lot of Red Cotton have sold enough to sew a set on at 1d a time, they cost me 1  a card I get about 12 lots off a card. Also I have sewn 8 sets on their Uniforms at  Franc a set so I have done well out of the Colour business. Several of the boys intend sending out the Sets I have supplied them to Australia as Soveniers from Belgium.
