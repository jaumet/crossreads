 Dear Dad, My afternoon off To-day &amp; I went down to the Jetty to see seaplanes go up, or rather stop down for none went up while I was there. I went into the Musee afterwards &amp; the Paintings were fine &amp; up to any I've ever seen. Some were about 30 ft by 15 ft  &amp;  lovely rather like a huge Photo. I walked around Shops &ndash; window gazing looking for Souvenirs but they are either very expensive or, very shoddy mostly the latter. I spent the evening at the Y.M.C.A. listening to a Yankee Concert Party. They were a scratch lot &amp; would only get a hearing at a Y.M.C.A. or Church army Hut. Still it was good of them to entertain us. Best wishes for the Happy New Year   Harry
