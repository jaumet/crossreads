<p>13 February, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>I was at Church Parade this morning &amp; for a change went to the non conformists. The chap who was preaching in spite of his queer style delivered a good sermon.  This after noon I spent writing letters a job I don't take to easily of late. The boys did not do too well at the races yesterday &ndash; They all came home growling at the tote. Bill came out of one race &frac12; pt the better &amp; Perce put &amp;pound;2.0.0 on a horse &amp; got 10 pt in return above his stake. I heard of an officer who said he would lay &amp;pound;200.0.0 to &amp;pound;1.0.0 that we would be back in Australia within six months. I hope he wins all the money, but am thinking seriously of looking him up to have a bet with him.</p>
<p>Wonder will I get any letters tomorrow. I think that there must be a mail in. I wish they would shift us some where for a change I am getting fed up with this place &amp; so are the rest of the boys, they are getting restless &amp; irritable &amp; one hears squabbles &amp; bits of fights about &ndash; It was the same this time last year after we had been in Egypt for a while</p>
