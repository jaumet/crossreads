<p>equipment in readiness for an inspection. I saw Bill Wilsons brother last night he is much younger than Bill. [Shorthand Not Transcribed]<br/>Orders came through today that 50 &percnt; of all employed men are to drill every day.<br/>Thursday March 7. 1918. 1312 day of the War.<br/> A fine day. I with others went out to drill this morning, with Head Quarters, and returned at 11. a.m. There was a lot of dissatisfaction in the Transports about drilling as the other work is neglected. Horses &amp; mules were left ungroomed, and the stables dirty. Only a few men were left in camp when the drivers went out with their limbres. We were marched out to the Paradegrounds with the Polic[?] &amp; Pioneers and had Squad Drill. An officer to about every 10 men and Mr. Simpson over the lot. 4 officers for a little over 30 men. There is a surplus of officers in the Battalion &amp; drilling [indecipherable] gives them something to do. All transports</p>
<p>Card Trick<br/>Place the cards in the following order<br/>3. 8. 7. 1 <strike>King</strike> Queen. 6. 4. 2. Jack. <strike>Queen</strike> King. 10. 9. 5<br/>Then spell each number in rotation, commencing with 1. 2. 3. etc. finishing with Jack Queen King, placing the cards under the pack. When a number is spelt the card on top is the number. When all the cards are spelt they will be in rotation.<br/>in the Brigade now have to do drill. But I dont think it will last for long, as their work will be neglected, the A..S.C. &amp; the Veterinary Corps will put in an adverse report. The O.C.'s of Transports are against drilling<br/>End of Book 9<br/>Cantombles 7/3/18<br/>J.D. Wilson<br/>Continued in Book 10</p>
