<p>quite a swag of little photos from Australia in my service pocket book so occassionally I can take them out when I get real sick of this monotonous job here:  one grows old, foolish, sentimental &amp; homesick, &amp; wants knocking on the head at times.</p>
<p>Fancy them showing my photograph in Hay, you shouldn't have told me so, as its made my head swell up to much.</p>
<p>By Jove, there's no doubt a Colonial lives a decent friendly happy life and a full (N.B. doesn't refer to liquor) one compared to an Englishman.</p>
<p>So the married fellow who saw you in Hospital in Sydney gave you some fatherly advice &ndash; I note his wisdom in picking deep holes in your conscience for the advice to sink into &ndash; however the worst fault he could find would not be a bad one to my thinking.</p>
<p>Well goodbye &amp; good luck to John, and all my friends:  fancy Graham getting so big.  I wonder if he'll know me next time.</p>
<p>Ever yours sincerely<br/>Jock C. Ellis</p>
