<p>C/o The D.M.S.<br/>Cairo<br/>Egypt.<br/>9th June 1915.</p>
<p>My dear Girls:</p>
<p>This afternoon there was delivered to me several packages, mostly newspapers but one was not of this nature and came as a very pleasant surprise.  When it was opened, the first that met my gaze was the pleasing sweet smile of My Kitty then My Tabbie with hat on head, and thirdly My Joseph with the tousled hair.</p>
<p>Each was pleasing to me and I greeted every picture with a kiss.  Many thanks for sending them.   Joseph dear you have the most serious face, but even in it there is a smile for me.   The three smiles are very much appreciated in this far off land of heat dust and colour, by an old man who loves the originals as well as tis possible for him to love any one.</p>
<p>Please forgive me for the bad typing, for some reason or another tonight my fingers are not diving in correct style, my musculature is out of order to a slight extent.  I have not been out all day.  Think that I shall take a run to Heliopolis for a few minutes, after I have been round the wards to note if my lambs are settling down for the night.  It is 9-40 p.m.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>10 p.m.   They are settling to sleep for the night.  The asphalte is jolly hard, a few of the more sick have beds but the majority have a mattress on the hard floor, some few slept last night on the sand.   The photographers here do not appear to me to be of as high a class as are those in Sydney.  The Mahomedan, who makes up so much the largest portion of the population is to much of a philosopher to bother about such trivial affairs as having his picture put upon paper, a superfluity no doubt he thinks.  It may be, but if so it is a very pleasant one for those who desire to have a representation of loved ones who are not present.  I do not wish to rise to the heights of satisfaction which might make me look upon such matters as not of the pleasantest.</p>
<p>The temperature is high to night, if one might choose a sleeping spot, the best is the roof of the building, it may be that the rich people spend the early part of the nights during summer on the top of the houses, from 4 to 8 a.m. are the pleasantest hours of the twenty four, but even during them the comfort which was with riding in the early morning is absent in this month of June.</p>
