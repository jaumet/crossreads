I may be here for a couple of months and I may be here for 12.  I dont think that I will though, not if I can help it.
I cannot tell you anything about the town we are in camp a couple of miles out and so far I have seen very little of the town as it was late when we arrived there and we were just shoved into cars and rushed off to this place. Tonight I think we will be taking a walk in there this evening to have a look round. There perhaps I will be able to find something to write about at present all I know is that we can see the ocean out at the back there from the hill we can get another glimpse of it from out in front so I guess this place is on a sort of peninsula. I was sorry to leave Stoke as I was very comfortable there, and I like the sisters. I did not get an opportunity to go over the Stoke and Hanley potteries I would like to have seen them before I left
