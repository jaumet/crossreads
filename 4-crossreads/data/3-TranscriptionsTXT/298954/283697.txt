McAnally, Haxton &amp; all those passengers from the "Matunga" &amp; "Hitachi" have been working with the labour gangs, met us with tears in their eyes &amp; wailed how they had been placed in the labour gangs as common prisoners!    We, the tolerated, but only tolerated, merchantmen went to officer's treatment as members of one of the Services (if not  the  Service), whilst they, the Anglo-Indian passengers, have been in coal mines, latrine gangs, etc.   And McAnally &amp; Green were on a Night-Cart!!!
