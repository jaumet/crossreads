  
 Thursday June 5th Capetown 
 Up anchor & away at 8.15 am struck a choppy sea & the old tub rolled badly : I felt pretty crook all day : 
 Friday June 6th at Sea 
 Nothing much doing : still a fair sea running & we are getting a good roll about 
 Saturday June 7th at Sea 
 Nothing much doing : sea a bit quieter : haven't been too good since leaving Capetown : it must be the surplus feeds we had there : 
 Sunday June 8th at Sea 
 Church parade in morn : sing song at night
