<p>during the afternoon, we were paid this morning. Tuesday 18th it rained last night &amp; we were driven to shelter.  We sighted two steamers, one this afternoon and one tonight, they caused a lot of excitement.  Wednesday weather cooler, Kit inspection over stolen money.  Thursday 20th it rained all last night - &amp; on &amp; off today, the sea has a bit of a swell on &amp; some of the Boys are sick.  We had a boxing tournament yesterday afternoon &amp; some of the bout were hard hitting affairs.  Friday, was showery we arrived at Colombo at 2pm &amp; obtained leave till 8 PM.  <br/>  <br/>Colombo Harbour is made by breakwaters two from each side of the bay &amp; a centre one giving the harbour two entrances. The natives are very excitable &amp; the ferrymen have very heated arguments over passengers, but the Police soon settle matters, the natives have a very great respect for the Native Police &amp; they don't even argue.  The ferryman will get as much money as possible, well the same applies to all of them &amp; one has to be very firm, &amp; careful of his money.  The Police do not imprison the natives, but just give them a thrashing, hitting them on the head, neck or shoulders, they often cry but never hit back.</p>
<p>We anchored out in the stream, &amp; were rowed ashore, the town was far different to what we expected, the roads are excellent (native quarters exempt) though the traffic is very light.  The Rickshaw men worry you as soon as ashore leave the wharf &amp; won't take no for an answer, the kids are the last thing in begging, they will follow you a mile or two if they think there is the slightest chance of getting a penny, at first you feel full of pity for them, as they have a way of looking very pathetic, &amp; if you give to one, well that is the end of it, you will have a hundred round you in a minute, catching hold of your hand &amp; calling you to help little boy, some carry Babies to beg with, every adult seems to carry something to sell, rings, stones, elephants &amp; everything you can think of &amp; ask fabulous sums for them &amp; then come down to almost nothing.  The beach is very pretty, though it doesn't seem to be used much, the walk round there &amp; beyond is lovely for miles, it is the residential</p>
