<p>Mrs Caldwell<br/>"Hillmount"<br/>Burwood</p>
<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>On behalf of the actual recipients I tender my sincere thanks for your very welcome parcels received recently.</p>
<p>Unprecedented delay occurred in the receipt of them &amp; also on my part in acknowledging but "better late than never".</p>
<p>Our surroundings, conveniences &amp; the weather in this part of Froggy land don't offer many opportunities for correspondence hence</p>
