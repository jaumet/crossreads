14/4/18North and generally there is much mixup.  He has got us thinking.  Arranged details for our relief of the 21st tonight and fixed up guides &c &c.  After lunch walked round the companies and saw the different O.Cs whose preparations for moving forward are now well in hand.  The wind is strong and piercing and gives promise of bringing up rain or snow.  In any weather except absolute sunshine the Somme is a beastly place.  The village is becoming daily more and more shell battered and delapidated.  We are leaving a foot washing establishment here.
