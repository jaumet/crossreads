<p>Gee ! So near and yet so far. The accommodation is good and the tucker is fine. I had the first decent meal today I have had since my last leave in London.<br/>28th We have just been through a tick spraying operation  which reminds one of the gas chambers we had to pass through before we were allowed to go up the line. As we come out of the door we were given cigarettes and an apple. This bought back memories of Sunday School picnics and I was tempted to ask the man giving out the tobacco and fruit if I could have one to take home to my little brother.</p>
