 January, 1916 Monday 10 A lot more Machine Gunners expected in some time today &amp; I am told I will have to take a class. About 5 pm they arrive in hundreds &amp; the work of putting them into tents &amp; getting them some grub took up several hours. They are in a bad way in regards to clothing &amp; money. 
 Tuesday 11 I am given a squad of 20 men from the 6th  Bde M.G. Secs. The first day is very trying  But after getting into the swing of things it comes quite easily.
