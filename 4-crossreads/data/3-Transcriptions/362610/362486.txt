<p>Wednesday 27 Sept. 1916<br/>Up at &frac14; to 4 to go round the line with the General, quite an interesting walk. The trenches are much better in most ways than those on our left bde. front. Everything was very quiet &amp; the sunrise effects beautiful. Got back in time for breakfast &amp; after it moved into my dug-out, a much larger one than the pokey little chap. Much admire the immediate surroundings, especially in the way of the forest trees. In the afternoon went out getting an idea of the positions of units. One or two showers of rain towards evening. Cuthbert arrived from England &amp; told me that Rid had come over to Bailogne by the same boat. It was very good news.</p>
