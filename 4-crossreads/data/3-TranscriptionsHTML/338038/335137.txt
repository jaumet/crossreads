<p>III<br/>Cape Helles which I hope is the case. Young Newmarch who is in the 3rd Batty was badly wounded some few weeks back, but is now doing well in Hosp. at Alex. where Mrs D Newmarch is giving her services as a nurse.<br/>The enclosed clipping caught my eye in the Sydney "Bulletin" of July 8th. This is the Father McAuliffe who travelled with us to Egypt on the "Argyllshire". The story as told is hardly what happened though. It was during an advance of the 2nd Battalion to which Father McA was attached that someone told him the Turkish Priest was bearing arms. "Then give me a rifle and bayonet" he said "O'im going out to look for the divil and have it out with him". He is a great chap this same Padre &ndash; I was speaking to him yesterday just prior to his departure for a spell. Just as he left he turned round &amp; said "Well good-bye, I expect the next time we meet twill be over in Maidos" and added as an afterthought "O'ill be kapeing the Pub there".<br/>Glad to see by Father's letter that Les has been made a Corporal.</p>
