 F. We sit about all day & look at Books all afternoon. I play Hymns all morning & Auntie sees Septers tail go up. M & I have to rush to stop her talking because the V. has come in quietly. 
 12 May, Monday 
 F. We all walk around lane by rush cutter's place & round one of the hedge again. No good night & I sleep ever sowell & wake up very late, & then, addition to the family - Septer's foal.
