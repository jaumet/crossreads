<p>Sun 15th<br/>Woke up within sight of land.  a very pleasant sight sailing along close to land.  scores of very narrow boats with outriggers on them fishing.  we passed quite close to some of them.  saw a school of porpoises during Church Parade all around a native boat &amp; quite close to us.  I am on duty from 12 to 4 P.M.<br/>dropped anchor at Colombo about 2 P.M.  I believe Colombo is the prettiest place ever I have seen in my life,  the Sydney and a five funnelled Cruiser flying the Russian flag together with the Jap that escorted us was anchored inside the breakwater when we arrived.  we can see <strike>the</strike> scores of black women dressed in all the colors of the rainbow on shore, with the aid of glasses, also the rickshaws are constantly on the go<br/>(The Empress of Rssussia is also anchored here)<br/>[indecipherable] armed merchantman</p>
