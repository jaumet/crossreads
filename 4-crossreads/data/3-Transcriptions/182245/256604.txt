<p>30 FRIDAY</p>
<p>Fine, but had one storm of sleet</p>
<p>&amp; rain at midday. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness all day. I rigged</p>
<p>up a stable outside &amp; put</p>
<p>old &quot;Lazarus&quot; outside again.</p>
<p>saw old Mother Jesus watching</p>
<p>one of the cows calve, &amp; as</p>
<p>soon as she calved, took</p>
<p>the calf away &amp; washed him</p>
<p>in ice cold water &amp; dried</p>
<p>him with straw. They dont</p>
<p>let the cow have her calf</p>
<p>here at all.</p>
