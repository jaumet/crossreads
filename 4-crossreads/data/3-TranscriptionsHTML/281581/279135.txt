<p>The Shackleton lecture shows 100 slides<br/>The Mawson      "       "    150   "<br/>The Scott          "      "      80   "<br/> and as fine sets of each are being made, it means about 1,600 slides in all! Quite a tall order to make each perfect. In addition two copies of 5,000 feet film each have to be made for each expedition. 30,000 feet film, and all to be carefully toned and stained.</p>
<p>29th July Monday</p>

Am tired of the sight of films and lectures. Was paid my outstanding account with Military after some four months.  A  balance of &pounds;22 still owing will be paid in Novr by Paymaster, Victoria Barracks, Sydney.</p>
