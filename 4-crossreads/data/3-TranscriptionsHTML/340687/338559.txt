<p>September, 1917. Wednesday 12<br/>Day fine &amp; windy. Spent morning finishing [indecipherable] and filling in camp shell holes. Quieter, afternoon off and going out to-night at 2 to make road just behind front. 1, 2, &amp; 3 back about 10. No casualties but plenty of gas and fairly warm work getting in and out.</p>
