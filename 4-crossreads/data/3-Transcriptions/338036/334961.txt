<p>ZONNEBEKE<br/>[30th Sept. contd]<br/>consequently two were wounded &amp; on calling for stretcherbearers I went across &amp; got them &amp; took them to the Dressing Station after applying a field dressing.  Forgot to mention that the ground we were walking over was only captured a few days ago and the stench of dead bodies was overwhelming.  Plenty of horses too. From our pill box we could see Zonnebeke quite plainly &amp; the also the ridge which was to be our next objective.  On our right was Westock &amp; Polygon Wood also.</p>
<p>We were situated on the ridge opp Zonnebeke &amp; there were pill boxes all along the sky &amp; of course he had a nasty habit of shelling them.  The night was moonlight &amp; that assisted us considerably.  At about 4 am distress signals went up &amp; soon our guns &amp; Fritzs too were hammering away like billeo  Probably a counter attack.  At 7.30 we put up a special try [?] out barrage &amp; it was great to witness.</p>
<p>OCTOBER<br/>Monday 1st<br/>Sam was in a larger size <strike>pill box</strike> dug out nicely finished off &amp; with electric fittings.  At about 11 oclock I went down to Lone Wood for a doze as things had quietened down a bit.</p>
