<p>I wondered what chance I would have of being accepted &amp; most of that night I lay awake thinking of whether I could pass, &amp; in the end I decided to apply next day.</p>
<p>Next morning I applied to the Marconi Coy in person &amp; was shown the terms under which we would serve. Being able to operate at the commercial rate, I was accepted &amp; arranged to start the following morning. I made straight for the Tramway Offices to resign. It was agreed to reinstate me on return, providing I was not maimed &amp; also on condition that I served in either a military or naval capacity, the latter case (naval) being fulfilled. Without desiring to criticise at all, I received a hearty farewell from the officers &ndash; all contained in the one sentence "Got any tram passes or railway ticket?" So much for their sentiments.</p>
<p>Next morning I began at the Marconi Coy. I would like to explain here that this Troopship class was arranged by the Navy with the Marconi Co, who were paid so much per Operator for the use of their school. It therefore was distinctly a Naval arrangement whereby we were to practice until we were required.</p>
