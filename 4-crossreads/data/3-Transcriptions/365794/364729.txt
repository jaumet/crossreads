<p>Wednesday 21 November 1917<br/>Quite a cold snap in the air &amp; splendid for working.  Life as usual.  Went town &amp; bought an Egyptian spoon, lucky charm, base &amp; pin tray.  The charm of the city grows on one with time &amp; the dirt is less noticeable.<br/>About a doz. dressings for morning work in Maxwell &amp; most on foments as well.<br/>Capt. Mitchell in charge &amp; Major Farrant the Surgeon.  Col. Wade is to see a knee partly shot away but main artery not severed.<br/>How strange it is to hear a well bred Englishman address one as if in ordinary circumstances, in these wards where most of the tommies have a very marked dialect.</p>
