We have had extremely hot weather for the last week or so &amp; everyone is appearing in the lightest of dresses. The Orsova is a lovely vessel &amp; a splendid sea boat   We were indeed lucky to be appointed to her.  We have now been 10 days out of sight of land &amp; have only seen 2 steamers during that time.  We have just sighted on starboard bow a smoke which is probably that of a transport that left Freemantle 2 days ahead of us. Two or 3 days ago I, in company with another chap who knows one of the engineers, went down the engine room &amp; was shown all over the engines (twin screw) dynamos, board, &amp; propellors.  It is truly a magnificent piece of machinery, &amp; kept in splendid order. The meals have been splendid so far &amp; I have always been ready for my tucker.  The supply of fresh water is running out &amp; we are on condensed water now which is not half as nice as the fresh.
