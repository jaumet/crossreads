will Remember fighting Mac. Cpt. McKenzie well he was our Brigade Chaplain for some time now he is Mjr. McK. he has been over in Blighty on holiday but I fancy he spent the greater part of the time visiting the boys in Hos.   he arrived back here last Thursday evening, and received a cheer from the mob as soon as he put in an appearance.  There is very little more that I can tell.  I hope that Bett is non the worse for her illness I must write to her soon I was very sorry to hear that Mollie had hurt herself again, poor kiddie    Much love to all at home and heaps for yourself fromYour Loving sonChas
