the Lady, as Aunt Pollie was the Lady of Dad's Family.  She is or was the one to entertain while any of the other Cinderellas made the Tea.  But don't let on about my opinion.  I would not offend good old Marion.  So D. Drayton is getting into the Limelight on the big Theatres at last.  He was always clever enough but too bombastic.  Dave is a terrible skite so I am not surprised if the rest of the Family are, but that is the only failing & one can easily get over that.  Poor Mrs. Niness, she dotes on Dave but then He is a lovely Boy, you know.
