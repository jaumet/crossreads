Saturday 15 September 1917
AlexWent to the Races & lost my good gold but had a lot of fun. One gets into a crowd of officers of all Regiments here & must go along with them. Still no word of a boat so one of our Majors have been recalled to his Regiment, we are afraid this may happen to more of us.
As I have told you before the Totalisator & Starting gate are used & most of the horses are grey stallions (Arab).
"Quail" are landing all along the coast & the Natives catch them easily poor beggars being very tired after their fly across the Mediteranean. Too tired to make good shooting.
