The dental branch of the Army as far as our experience goes, has been rather a joke as we can never get the dentist to do anything owing to him always being packed up Having a tender gum I went to Bicourt farm passing through the wood (now cut down), the stumps of trees left are bullet scarred and the ground is littered with underbrush. Found the dentist at work in a little room in a hut. He had a very complete kit and seemed to be doing good work on his patients. Scraped my teeth and then agreed to put in an hour on the work tomorrow morning. The bttns camped round here were 5th Bde so called at the Bde HQ. The General not yet returned but expected today. Col Ralston told me that 4th Divn were through the Hindenburg line with the aid of tanks. Training this morning was practical advance guards and went off very well. Afternoon was half holiday and devoted to Coy. football matches. Spent most of the time writing letters
