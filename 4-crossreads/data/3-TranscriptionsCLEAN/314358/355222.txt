 Try and manage as well as you can on our small income of 4/- per day, but if possible get the allowance for yourself and the children for I am merely a sapper still. 
 My own needs are not great. 
 That amount they have compelled me to re-pay is nearly made up now so I will soon draw more than 2/- per week. 
 The main this is to win the fight which we will do 
 With love Geoff
