<p>22/9/17 Westhoek<br/>over we had a quiet night but just at dawn the S.O.S went up on our right bringing down the heavy barrages. A heavy fog also came on but no attack developed. A shell blew out one of our posts killed 3 and wounded 7. A runner of the 23rd. wearing the ribbon of the Military Medal came in and said he had seen one of our chaps with his leg blown off and another partially disembowelled &amp; shrieking. "Terrible" was his only comment. In an hour or two a stretcher was brought down to R.A.P with a blood stained body very much blown about and one poor foot missing. I ordered a German overcoat to be put over the poor face and the lads buried it. They also buried a tangled heap of dead Germans and some souvenirs were found in the ratting. Hunt found a heap of dead Tommies of the City of London Regiment &ndash; relic of their unsuccessful attack. About 8 a.m.</p>
