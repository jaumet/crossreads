<p>it reason for this early parade is obvious.  Visited Heliopolis at night.</p>
<p>Thursday 29th July 1915</p>
<p>Beginning to get things in shape.  Moved into large tent &ndash; square-shaped &amp; airy.  We sleep, but do not mess in this.</p>
<p>Anniversary of wedding.  Pleasant thoughts.</p>
<p>Friday 30th July 1915</p>
<p>Mail closed.  Sent 4 P.C's to Mabel, 1 each to Dad, Mum &amp; Gran.  Had a chat with Arthur Gray.  How I am longing to hear from home.  My only worry is for those far away.  How dear are they to me.</p>
<p>Saturday 31st July 1915</p>
<p>Visited Cairo during afternoon.  This Hell on Earth alluring &amp; repulsive in its vice, crime, &amp; tartuffism <hypocrisy,>  cannot be described here.  I do not need any notes to remind me of its features.  Suffice it to say that prostitution, beastiality, drunkenness, crime <in all its every shape &amp; form &amp; all temptations of the devil> are its chief characteristics.  All the sinister temptations of the devil lurk here to catch the unwary. Sordid &amp; debauched. Cairo is a pestilential cesspit, a creator of 'evil &amp; a destroyer of souls'.  "Wazzar" burnt down by troops.</p>
<p>Sunday 1st August 1915</p>
<p>Visited Cairo.  How wonderful is the fascination of the place.  Though nauseating beyond description something draws you on &amp; so the Master Fiend finds heaps of victims.  His greedy talons are about everywhere.  Why does not the Almighty wreak some mighty vengeance on this rotten hole as he did with Sodom &amp; Gomohrn.</p>
