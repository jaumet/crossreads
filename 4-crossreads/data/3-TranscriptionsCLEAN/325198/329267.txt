  
 13 March, 1916 Serapeum We got paid when we came in from Guard on Sat morning & I also received some letters.  During the morning Mr Ryrie came in & handed me my pass to go to Ismalia on the following day. Next morning Hickey Crouch & I went down & caught the 9.3 tram from [to?] Ismalia, Crouch scaled up without a pass, he & Hick went up to Tel.el.Kebir - Ismalia struck me as being rather a pretty place but I did not have time to look around  it as I had get out to where Bert was camped.  I thought he was at Ferry Post but I found out that they had shifted to Moascar & I got out there at about 12 o'clock  He looks well enough & I was pleased to see him we had a long yarn, he could not get leave to come into town so I stayed in camp until about 8 oclock with him.  I was lucky to see him as he & his company are leaving to day & they think that they are going to France but I fancy that they will be bound elsewhere somehow  To day I have done practically nothing - took charge of the forage fatigue this morning.  To night some of the 5th & 7th Regts went out on a patrol I expect we will be on it soon
