<p>Saturday 9 Sept. 1916<br/>Beautifully fine. Fixing up ventilator for my dug-out during the morning, &amp; in the afternoon doing some clerical work for the General. About 6.30 p.m. set out with him to go up the line. Bright moonlight at first but by degrees it became foggy. Went with him into Noman's Land &amp; across "The Gap", a rather perilous walk for a General. Came through safely but wet through up to the knees. Had dinner abt. 10.30 &amp; then found an Aust. mail of 9 letters waiting. Devoured them in bed, taking past midnight in doing so.</p>
