<p>On Patrol today saw 1 Jackal 1 Gazelle- What they live on I don't know.<br/>The Jackal dig up the dead natives I think &amp; the Gazelle eat the Camel Bush &amp; Desert Thorn.<br/>We are making a Military Road here to get the Guns out on the Desert, great gangs of Natives &amp; Camels carting Stones, no doubt spys are among them but the English are a trusting lot. <strike>We now are looking to Roumania for help.</strike><br/><u>Posted</u></p>
