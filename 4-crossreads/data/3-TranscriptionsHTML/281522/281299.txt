<p>24/5/17 Bouzincourt<br/>The afternoon was another good "goin" of specialists and the rifle bombers put up some good barrages. The miniature range was also going under McKinnon &amp; Kohn. Put in recommendations for the promotion of Rodda &amp; Cawthorne and about half a dozen lieutenants. A fair number of Orderly Room cases on account of staying overtime in Amiens. The M.P.'s seem to put in the dirt on our good lads and little things like slipping on the handcuffs are not calculated to do very much good. In the street this afternoon met three fine and fashionable girls who make a living the easy way. A very great convenience for the men as these girls are quite nice. We now have a special prophlactic room with its blue light and all needing attention go there. Our clown has been evacuated V.D. at mess had rather a character of a lecture on Rations and cooking by an expert from Corps headquarters. How to utilise dandelions nettles etc. as vegetables.</p>
