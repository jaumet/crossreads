Alroy is going strong. I had dinner in his Company Mess last night & had him to dinner here the previous night.
The Colonel went on leave to Paris this morning so I am in charge of the show. Most of our work consists in shovelling snow off the "Route Nationale". As soon as we have shovelled off all the snow a frost will probably set in and we shall spend the next couple of days chipping the ice off & then it will snow again. At present there is just under a foot of snow on the ground and it is still falling in a soft thick steady manner which suggests that it intends to keep on falling thick & steady for about another 6 or 8 days.
[The following text is written along the left-hand margin]We spent a splendid New Year's day. Had a lot of the Coy officer's in to dinner & all the others came in afterwards & we had a good old sing song. We possess one of the best piano players I have ever heard; he of course is invaluable,
Best Love to allYours affectionatelyC.R. Lucas
