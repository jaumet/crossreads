<p>an easy style if possible but really one must converse with French people to learn to speak the language properly.<br/>It is great sport sailing in the harbour, I had a jaunt this morning, we went out fishing &amp; I sailed the boat &ndash; we caught 29 fish and had a very enjoyable time.<br/>Give my kindest regards to the Doctor &amp; my love to Margaret &amp; the other two please.</p>
<p>Happiest remembrances<br/>Arthur M. Davidson</p>
