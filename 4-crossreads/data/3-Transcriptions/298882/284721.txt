<p>We have been well looked after in here.  Nearly all the work which should be done by nurses here is done by orderlies and they certainly do it very creditably indeed.  I am what is known as a sitting patient and have only half a blue ticket on my bed.  Lying patients have a whole ticket.  We were given a very good concert by some of the RAMC boys the other night.  The "lady" of the troupe looked 'Bon'.</p>
