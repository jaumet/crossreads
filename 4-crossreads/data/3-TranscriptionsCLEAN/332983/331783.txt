  
 a long way, you cannot hear the guns. As a rule any shells that come over you can hear the report of the guns. Anyhow the burst are to high to do any damage  Last night one burst over a lot of French troops and horses, no damage done at all. A few drops of rain last evening not much Thunder rolling about this evening, wind rather too high for rain 27/8/1915 The weather is cool and cloudy, a few drops of rain last night, with indications of more today. Vance is doing three days in the trenches, with an officer observing artillery fire. Last evening a few high time shrapnel over no damage done. The R.N.D. were amongst them, As before stated they have moved camp. Some very nasty shells over at 7.30, about 200 yards in front of our lines, 8in time shrapnel expected them to increase their range, but as luck would have it, they switched away to our right, and got on to the French. The  French Battery in front of our wagon line have moved forward it was the 46 Bty. We hear that the French is taking over this peninsula. It will be rough here in the winter, it is bad enough today
