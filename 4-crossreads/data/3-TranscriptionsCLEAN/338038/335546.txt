  
 [Printed page] THE SUM OF CHIVALRY 
 What shall be said of him, your friend, That very perfect gentle knight Whose fair life, crowned with such an end, No graven scroll could praise aright? 
 There is a simple line can tell Of the great spirit, proud and free, Whose steadfast vision still would dwell Upon the star of Courtesy. 
 No shining warrior prince of old, Whose glory fit the knightly days, But this brief epitaph had told The perfect measure of his praise. 
 Yet him we mourn a courage graced That finds no ancient counterpart, What knew they of the deaths he faced With laughter from a boyish heart? 
 There needs no marble, just the small Rude cross of wood that soldiers rear, And this for proud memorial - "AN AUSTRALIAN GENTLEMAN LIES HERE"
