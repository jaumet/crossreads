  
 We took position in front of the town with the Parramatta & Protector on our right & the Sumatra on our left  -  We saw no one - no boats came off  -  The German flag flew at one or two points & a lot of now Deutsch flags - white with an anchor - flew over sheds & buildings but no Union Jack  -  The Australia remained outside  -  No Germans apparent but I picked up a small mob with my glasses  - You never saw such an apparently dead & deserted township  -  There cant be more than 5 -600 souls here  - Well then we dropped anchor & had dinner & after dinner the 2nd officer got his mandoline & we had rag time songs & our boat looked like a corner public house on a Saty night (We are looked on as a rag time ship - Robert D Lee is our rag name)  -  The Parramatta chap promptly  made us darken ship & out went every glim -  He thought we'd have a dance next or a Stoker's night out  -  Bed & sleep & up at 6  -  Breakfast at 8  -  Position unchanged  -  Still the German flags flying & we in position
