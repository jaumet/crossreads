  
 Friday 19th April 1917 [1918] Visited by the C.O. & M.O. 10.30 a.m.  Usual greeting, "well Nurse how are you", etc., feels pulse, says shall be allowed up soon by Capt. Spencer (shrieks of silence from the aforesaid Capt. in the rear) then on my remarking "never been in bed so long before" says "no, hope you don't have to stay so long again", he departs.  Wonderful human beings compared to our own doctor in T'ba [Toowoomba]. On the advice of my new night Sister, I ask to be moved to a less public room & by 3 p.m. find myself in "No. 6", 3 beds, nice outlook &  quiet . N. Warrell visits me again.  I do not know why. A nice letter from "Frank" at Monastier [?] & photo of F.E.H. enclosed. From my window the view of flat Egyptian scenery is fine, green fields & stately figures move therein & palms in the background.
