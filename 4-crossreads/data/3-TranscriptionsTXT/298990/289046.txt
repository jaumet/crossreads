 Cassel, Noordpeene, Buysscheure 22/10/16 villages each of which had a fine church some of great age.  All the people today were wearing their best clothes.  To clear a village with our transport column I had to march the men for an extra 10 minutes which was a bit of a stinger and when the whistle blew they all gave a thundering cheer of relief.  The cookers soon came up and served out dinner.  After an hour's halt we pushed on again and had good marching along lanes and pleasant winding roads some of which took extremely sharp turns at times almost right angles.  Our billeting parties did not meet us where we anticipated and I began to   think it would be necessary to billet the battalion myself.  We soon found ourselves going across unfenced open cultivated land and from a high spot on the ground a very great extensive view spread before us.  In the distance was St Omer with its spires and towers looking blue with distance.  It was no easy thing to find our way with no other guide but a map. Soon the spire of  Buyscheure church appeared above the trees and we halted the column and then rode on to reconnoitre.  Near the old church we found our billeting party and marched into billets.  I was quartered in a two storey building with Monsieur le Cure &ndash; a decent old chap in pants and cassock who spoke very little English and cracked a bottle of wine with us. This little village has a Maire-'ess' and the 'Maire' is her son a bright boy of 12. The church tower is 700 years old, the rest of the church 300.  No old tombs as the graves are used again every 30 years or so.  Altogether a good place this and today's march has taken us through lovely country.
