<p>We embarked on the Huntscreen today. The 1st and 2nd Bns Bde. H.Q. and a New Zealand regiment are on board here. We expect to go to Alexandria. The Huntscreen is well armed against submarines. She has about a dozen machine guns as well as one 12 lb. naval gun bristling from her decks. She is the captured German prize ship Derfflinger 24.12.15</p>
<p>Left Mudros bay for destination unknown on Xmas morning. Our Xmas ration for the whole day is 1 tin of bully</p>
