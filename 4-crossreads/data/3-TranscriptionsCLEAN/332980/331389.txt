  
 & I packed my Valice as I was going away at 5 oclock for Edinburgh, I spent the Afternoon chatting with the Daughter of my Hostess who is a very charming Young Lady, well Educated & had Travelled a lot, therefore in exchanging views & experiences I spent an enjoyable Afternoon until 4.30 when I said Good Bye to my Chum who was remaining for a few days more, also  my  the Hostess & her Daughter & thanking them for their Kindness during my stay, off I went to the Station & was soon aboard the Train & at 5.5 Pm. it steamed away on its journey, passing through Hillside which is the Junction of the Edinburgh & Glasgow lines, we were running quite close to the Sea for a long way & what surprised me was the splendid Soil right close up to the Sea, with Gardens & crops growing splendid, the Scenery along this line was still beautiful & very hilly in places, then we passed through Montrose another Fishing Town of a fair size, then through Arbroath, still hugging the Coast to Dundee, arriving there at 7.10 Pm & only stopped for 5" minutes & off again
