 JANUARY 1917 
 19 FRIDAY 
 Fine with&nbsp; cold wind blowing. We 
 packed up &amp; left our billets at 
 Strazeele about 10 AM &amp; came 
 up to our positions at Armenti&egrave;res 
 The waggonslines are about four 
 miles behind the lines. Jesus Farm. We have 
 good covered stables with flaged 
 floor so we have no mud. We 
 have small huts to sleep in, &amp; are 
 very comfortable though crowed. 
 I was lucky &amp; got a bunk to sleep 
 in. I came up driving lead of 
 a G.S waggon, &amp; was lucky to 
 get it as I came straight to 
 the waggon lines, while the 
 others went up to the pits &amp; did 
 not get back till all hours 
 of the night. I was on picket 
 at night. Well I have got to 
 [??w] at last after a year &amp; 
 14 days in the army.
