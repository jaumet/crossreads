Later It transpires that an English battery asked for and got permission to shoot on our front. Voila la raison! After mess went down to the Transport and saw Colonel Brazenor thence to our lines and through Franvillers to Bdes H.Q. at Heilly. There was a heavy bombardment going on. All at Bde. were in fine fettle over the success of today and the General complimented me. He has complimentary letters from Generals Rawlinson Birdwood and Smythe. Got a good deal of inside information about the reorginazation of our Force and shifts and changes of Generals. Jack seems to have done a splendid job of work in Ville'sur-Ancre today and killed a German officer who is said to have treacherously shot one of our men. The booming of the 23rd for a V.C. have already commenced. What a game it all is. Rang up all the different C.Os. up the line also gave them cheeri-oh and congratulations. There was a fair amount of transport on the roads and the guns were active as we returned.  The Hun is using new flares which remain a long time stationary in the air. It was an enjoyable ride home over ploughed and sown fields with a good moon overhead and the scents of the country in the air were almost intoxicating in their way. On arrival back at Montigny I made shift to do some writing. Old Madame was waiting up for me ? they take no risks about locking up these French. Braithwaite and Anderson came in to talk of the stunt.
