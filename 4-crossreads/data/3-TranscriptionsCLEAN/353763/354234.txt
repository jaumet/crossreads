I last wrote on W-day  - since then there has been nothing to record  -  The weather has been fine but we'v been much delayed by a head sea & wind from the S.E. - Our runs show  - 180-137-156 Very very slow business this  -  We have taken a route clear of islands so as not to be norked by Germans  -  We went thro the Solomons  -  We saw Bellon & Rauelle islands on the starboard beam - huge elongated, well wooded islands  -  We have just done half our distance 920 miles in 6 days  -  We have not had any breakdown or accident & the health of all on board is excellent  -  Pharaoh set a good example when he hanged his chief baker & we wd  -  like to hang ours  -  His bread is too awful & he cant or wont cook things sufficiently  -  Tough dough constitutes his idea of pastry  -  Like everything else on the Upolu our freezing chamber is not too good & we've had to throw a lot overboard  - 6000 lbs of meat  -
