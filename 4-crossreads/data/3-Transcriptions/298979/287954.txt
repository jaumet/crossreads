<p>at Etaples for Boulounge to embark for "Blighty"</p>
<p>Before being allowed to go aboard the vessel each man had to enter what appeared to be an old factory but now fitted up as a huge bath room &amp; pass through a good warm shower bath, which none could avoid &amp; had to leave by a different door way than that by which the entrance was made.</p>
<p>This was to ensure every man was "perfectly clean" and on coming out of the Dressing room each received a Certificate the contents of which "tickled" the fancies of all when read. It certified that the bearer was "free from vermin".</p>
<p>This Certificate should have been handed up to the man at the gate of exit as authority to pass, but as a special favor the Sentry obtained permission to retain his as he considered it a unique experience.</p>
<p>This was the only Souvenir of the War, the Sentry brought back from France much preferring to be reminded of such an experience than of any thing belonging or appertaining to a Hun no matter of what artistic or intrinsic value.</p>
<p>During the period of marching to &amp; waiting for the Hospital Ship at Boulounge the whole of the men were splendidly "looked after" by Red Cross people; being supplied with Cigarettes Tobacco Biscuits Cakes &amp; Chocolate. The Red Cross, Kindred Societies, &amp; Comforts Fund are doing an enormous amount of exceedingly good work in looking after the "Boys" both "going in" to join the Battalion &amp; when coming back as an invalid.</p>
<p>While waiting on the Wharf to embark on the Hospital Ship the Sentry saw one of the officers of his battalion, one of the new men, D[dash], who had joined up just prior to going into action at Louverval &amp; eagerly enquired for news regarding the men reported "missing" but he could throw very little light on the subject, although when spoken to about C M[dash] in charge of A Coy's Machine</p>
