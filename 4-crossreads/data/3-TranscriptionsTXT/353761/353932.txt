Reveille sounds at about half past two in the weird sleep-bound moments of the early day.We are up before dawn while yet the silver night lingers and holds the world in its romantic darkness, which is not of gloom.Candles glimmer in the cook-houses, and we are soon at an early breakfast in the low huts which have been our quarters for a time.There in dim candlelight the troops are rapidly through with the hot tea, bread and butter, and bully beef which constitutes the meal; and then there is a scene of almost confusion as men are moving with their shifting shadows whilst packing their haversacks and adjusting their equipment.
