cobbled and surrounded with old tiled houses not unlike old Bailleul. All were soon settled down in their billets here. I had a cosy room with a folding bed. The streets thronged with troops for the whole Brigade is lodged here. Issued orders for our early start tomorrow. Mess was held in two fine connected rooms with a roaring coal fire and an Australian mail came to hand afterwards filling in the evening pleasurably. The old winding streets of the village were full of men until a late hour. Re the notorious duckhouse – last night Gorman waited till the moon went in and then with of G.S. acquired a good lot of timber from near a bridge. This morning our Pioneers rebuilt the place and the Maire gave us a clearance. All now hope this closes the affair.
