<p>arising each morning.</p>
<p>Feby 8th (Monday)<br/>Played "Bridge" from 2 to 4 p.m. &amp; 9 to 11 p.m. with the Doctor, Veterinary Surgeon, &amp; Chief Engineers.  The Dr &amp; Vet are real good sports too.</p>
<p>Rounded Cape Leeuwin at 9 p.m. weather glorious.</p>
<p>Feby 9th (Tuesday)  Beautiful weather today especially so, as around the Leeuwin bad weather is experienced a good deal.  I spent half an hour from 9 a.m. walking around the deck with a cobber of mine, &ndash; a very fine bay horse, &ndash; followed by a chestnut, also a very fine horse, who are allowed the run of the Ship &amp; they then act as decoys to the others, who are now following them around the decks for exercise.  However as they all pass by my room, I dont feel altogether "free from danger", especially as they "carried" my window away during their peregrinations this morning.  1 p.m. arrived off Rottnest Island where we awaited until 3 p.m. for the arrival of the Mashobra (a46) another Troopship with 365 Troops &amp; over 300 horses, the Western Australian Complement to the Reinforcements.  On coming alongside of us the Boys gave three very hearty cheers real British ones &amp; it sounded great out at sea.  We lowered a boat to get from her 3 barrels of Epsom salts for the Horses.  We also got some newspapers &amp; got our first war news since leaving.  At 5 p.m. the four Ships set out for Colombo.</p>
