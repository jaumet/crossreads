<p>3 &ndash; I long for news of you.<br/>I have not had letters from the girls or Gibson for a long time.<br/>I enclose a funny snapshot of some sisters &amp; me coming on duty &ndash; taken by a patient. I don't know why I'm looking so stiff I didn't know I was snapshotted till I saw the print. The nights are still very cool &ndash; but the sun is very hot &ndash; crossing the drill ground from our home to the hospital. I live Constance's letters you enclose &ndash; give her my dearest love. What a happy peaceful life she has &ndash; but full of romantic sorrows &ndash; such as the story of David's tooth. Oh Mum I long for you to talk to and I can hear you say &ndash; "now go to bed my poor little girl and don't think about it any more." The way you used to when I was full of all that had happened during a busy week at P.A. I hope Father is well. You cannot know <u>how</u> I long to see you all again &ndash; and yet if Father &amp; you keep well and strong I feel I am of use here as long as I am strong.</p>
