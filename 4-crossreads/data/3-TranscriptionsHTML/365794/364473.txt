<p>Tuesday 13 March 1917 [12 March 1918]<br/>Morning pass &amp; took voting papers to H.Q., voted for Tohine [?] of course (no alternative).  Met C. Garland &amp; he gave bunch of carnations "for the boys".  Whist drive 6-8 p.m. enjoyed by us all, tea etc. 4 p.m., about 34 pts. &amp; 9 whist tables.  To play with our pts. in a friendly way is so easy for me and so difficult &ndash; I imagine &ndash; for the British sisters.  Thank heavens I am first &ndash; a Nurse, 2nd, a machine for tidying beds, etc.</p>
