 5 p.m. I have already spent 12 hours in this wretched place, bleeding profusely and unable to move an inch. Subsequently death or captivity will befall me. Either convey unpleasant feelings. Whilst contemplating, the snow commenced to fall in thick flakes and soon we were nearly buried in mud and water; the damp earth however, caused the snow to thaw immediately it fell. Later, it fell so thickly and incessantly, that we were almost snowed in. During this awful dilemma several Hun officers passed by; they spat at us and jabbered something unintelligible to me.

Anyhow within a very few minutes he ran off, but needless to say he failed to return. In the meantime the snow continued to fall thickly and darkness set in. Oh! how
