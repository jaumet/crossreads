a new pen another Watermans She has cost me 21/6 I am now using her for the first time. I hope I have better luck with her than my other old favourite, I also bought a nice pocketbook, so you can see I have started cutting into my wages early but I think I have enough to see me out, I arrived at Eltham a straggling little town about 2.30 made off down to the address given me I found the place alright but I am not allowed inside, I made enquiries the girl told me that Mrs Oliver at present was out shopping I swore to myself set off for a stroll round the town for an hour or so, so here I am fed up writing in the Public Library, this is one of my days leave being slowly murdered
