<p>&quot;Who hath desired the sea -</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The sight of salt water unbounded.&quot;</p>
<p>Was Kipling seasick when he wrote that?&nbsp; For by the same token there were about a thousand lads on board a transport on the second night out who certainly did not desire the sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, and for a few hours I felt the same, I who had sailed a small &quot;topply&quot; canvas boat, and who had yachted in the bay, was seasick; however, it was short but very merry, or rather violent while it lasted, I ate without restriction and quite lost the good of two meals only.&nbsp; Possibly I could have escaped had I been very careful but as is my habit I went down amongst the men on the troop/deck trying to make them comfortable and then it happened.&nbsp; I know now one very good reason why our Les wanted me to wait until I had/my Commission for the difference in living conditions is very marked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;ve one a good deal to make our men in &quot;A&quot; Coy comfortable, in fact the organization of the routine has practically been left to your humble son and I&#39;ve put forth every effort to make them comfortable, spending my time below on the troop deck until I had a headache, even trying to get them their issue of beer.&nbsp; Some of my chaps were pretty bad so I used to smuggle them down some oranges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The food for every rank is 100% better than in the Australian Camps and now that the boys have their sea</p>
