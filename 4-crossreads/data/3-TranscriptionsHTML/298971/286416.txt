<p>morning.  I was asked to accompany a sgt. &amp; an officer as billet guide, so, late in the afternoon, after bidding "Au Revoir" to my many French friends we rode as far as the Y.M.C.A. in a motor Ambulance where we were transferred to the last of 40 lorries conveying the 31st Batt.  Up to the time we arrived in France there were over 30,000 of these lorries here but now the country is alive with them.  The civilians were sorry to lose the Australians</p>
