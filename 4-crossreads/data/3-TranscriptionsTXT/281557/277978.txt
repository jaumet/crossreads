Tune: Rock of Ages
Australia's battle Hymn.
God that made our Fathers strongLead us when the dangers throngGod that made our mothrs pureMake us steadfast to endureOn the waves or tent or fieldBe our sword and battle shieldHail our Empire spreading farGreat in peace and dread in warBanner brave as in the pastFloat on fort and tower and mastLet thy blazon flutter freeSouth and North and every seaHere thy sons shall guard the gatesof thy southward shores and straitsOn wide ocean we shall meetOne unsundered flag and fleetAnd the pathway of the sea Prove our broadening destinyOh for peace or battle prayNelson's signal points the wayDuty's claim and country's callShall be our concience for us allSet that signal high and then"Forward" Quit yourselves like men.                                           Refrain
God that watest through the dayGurad each seaward coast and bayGod in loves unsleeping mightKeep our homes through darkest night
