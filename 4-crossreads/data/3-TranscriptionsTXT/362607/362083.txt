Ellis & I took a run out to his place yesterday. No 2 Aust. Gen. Hospital is quite near here & think is where pow Stan Hodge died. We walked into the Sergeants Mess not expecting to find anyone we knew. The first one we bumped was Victor Harcourt who used to be left-saver on N. Steyne. He wishes to be remembered to Mum. He was a short fat chap a pommy.  We knew quite a dozen others & we had such a chatter over Tea. We went round to have a look over some of the Wards afterwards. Always an eye to business you see but they were nothing like our Wards in Blighty. Things are hard to get here.
