Sunday 26 May 
Last night's attack did not eventuate but the Bosch raided instead but was completely repulsed. He is shelling Pradelles dist. heavily with gas which I think is a prelude to the second phase of his offensive. Glorious weather still prevails.
Monday 27 May
Glorious day again things are quiet about here. We go up to the A.D.S. at Borre to-morrow.
