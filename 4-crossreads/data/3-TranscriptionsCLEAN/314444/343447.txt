She also mentions that May's boss - Miss Stone - has given a 100 piastre note (1 ) for which I will thank her later. Remember old May and include her in the reading as I have to group all my good Samaritans when writing. Keep old Mum ding dong - I know she worry's a good deal but let her know I am "allus gott" or "tres bon". Poor old G.S. manages to give you a game of peek a booh; he must have the staying powers of a Carbine; I shouldn't be surprised at him lasting you all out. 
 Give my best of wishes to Bollorah & tell Dolph not to get cross with me if I appear to neglect him; it is an awful time trying to know who is next for mail. I have had several of Nina's letters & have replied on several occasions. Im sorry to hear of Pearly being on the rocks, altho I suppose its the ultimate adventure for us all. How does old Joe advance these days? I hardly ever hear of him; Best of good wishes to you all & remember me to all who may have have been pardds in pre war days. I guess it will be another five years before I see you all. Until then,
