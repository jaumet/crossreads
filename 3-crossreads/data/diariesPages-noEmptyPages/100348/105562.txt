8/5/16.
Route Mached 10 Kilometres to the east of Etaples. The country is very pretty now for spring is well advanced. There are no fences round the farms here or hedges of any kind; I wonder how the farmers know their lands. There are no detached farms, for the farmers cluster in villages and hamlets, so these small villages are numerous. Observed the system of billeting troops. There is a regiment of British cavalry billeted in these hamlets. They say they have been there for many months. They are having an easy time at present for they are not called on to serve in the trenches now. Was paid 14/- when we returned. Went down to my Estaminet and spent some of this wealth.
