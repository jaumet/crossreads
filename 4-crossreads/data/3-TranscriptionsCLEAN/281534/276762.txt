 After practising the General Salute and being photographed several times, the Prince of Wales arrived with Sir J.T. Hobbs and others. A small pallid youth with a soft petulant face devoid of firmness. He slouched round the ranks shook hands with me and asked where the Battalion was billetted. He then pinned on some medals and took the march past. Back to Gourdinne and wrote all the afternoon. Great ceremony when our guard changed over band &c. Went to "C" Coys dinner at 5.30 and the General & BM McCall came in. To "D" Coys dinner which was better. Crowds of civilians came in - a great event with them. Made a speech and then slipped away. Tonight is dark and a little powdery snow - the first of the season - is falling.
