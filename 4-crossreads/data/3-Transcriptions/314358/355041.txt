<p>3<br/>Lieutenant [indecipherable] has gone, a bullet struck his rifle sight and glanced off mortally wounding him. His grave is by the shell troubled shore over there in Gallipoli.</p>
<p>They promoted young Field to take his place</p>
<p>We dont get much news but it come to us now and then. Private Jones has gone, Private Brown wounded, Sergeant Watson shot whilst landing, so on and so on</p>
<p>Then some poor beggar turns up in our midst with shattered nerves. He has been to the front and was thrown aside unhurt by the explosion of a shell which killed perhaps five or six of his mates and wounded perhaps ten others.</p>
<p>Yet all of us who are forced to stay here are anxious to get to the front and all are as merry as sand boys.</p>
<p>However dont worry about me darling for somehow the good luck which comes to me in the last moment of events always will be mien and that will see me through. Besides it is written as they said od old that all things must be fulfilled<br/>Thus I have to return to my Australia to see my mother and to be with you all again.</p>
<p>I am sorry darling that your present of New Zealand green-stone was lost on board ship, nor could I find it dear in spite of all manner of searchings and enquiries</p>
