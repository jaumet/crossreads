  
 Australian Army Medical Corps, A.I.F. letterhead 1st Dermatological Hospital, Staff Recreation Room (Church Army), Bulford, Salisbury. July 23rd 1917 Dear Dad, Mum & George, I am just now going to start to give You a few details of my Trip to Manxland again.  I had better tell you all from Day to Day & then I'll remember everything in order.  I set out from Hospital on 14/8/17 at 12 Noon.  One of my best Friends who was going to London on 2 days leave went with me.  We had dinner in Salisbury & leaving S'bury at 1.50 pm arrived in London at 3.30 pm.  I journeyed via the Tube to Euston & have booked through to Liverpool, I set out for some Mungaree.  I went to the A.B.C. Restaurant just outside the Gates in Euston Road, & had something to eat (1/3 worth is all that is allowed during the afternoon), so being still hungry I went down to another shop & bought some fruit & cake.  I admired some peaches & grapes but the former were 6d & 8d each & only very small & the latter 2/6 per lb so I did not invest.  I left Euston at 5.30 pm & My Travelling Companions were 2 Liverpool Jack Tars, a Tommy from Kent, a Scotsman & Ulsterman from Belfast & a Belgian artilleryman.  The latter spoke no English at all & I was able to help Him a little with the tiny scrap of French that I picked up in Egypt.  I arrived in L'pool at 10.15 pm & straightway went down & took my Room at the Angel Hotel in Dale Street
