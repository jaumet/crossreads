Such a scene of desolation would break anyone's heart - to think of these poor folk their homes fast being blown to pieces and all their property abandoned to a soldiery.  As yet the house is fairly intact but shells are falling all round and there are batteries very close alongside.  Had a late supper early this morning upstairs.  Did not get up until noon and my batman then had a bath ready for me.  Clothes &c all lying round
