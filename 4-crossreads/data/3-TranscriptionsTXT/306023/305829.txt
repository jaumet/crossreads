Saturday 9th.Went to Communion this morning with six or seven others. Lovely day, quite warm.
Bayonet drill all morning. Long march with full pack in the afternoon. We now have to carry all our stuff in the pack, kit bags done away with and all superfluous stuff taken from us.
Kit inspection after tea. Expect to move for our final training tomorrow morning early.
Big Australian mail in but not sorted yet so don't know if my parcels or papers have arrived. Had none so far.
