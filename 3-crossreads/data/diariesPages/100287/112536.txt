last night a little bunch of us were sitting up on my favourite place on the coils of rope when enormous shoals of flying fish started to hop out of the water, there were millions of them the noise they made as they sprang out of the sea sounded like great coveys of quail rising, they look for all the world like swallows skimming the waves but they don't seem to be able to dodge the waves for they disappear as soon as they hit them, they can fly till their wings get dry then they drop in to the sea, they must have had a lot of sharks or something amongst them to make the fish leave the waters in the numbers they did, they say these fish are very good meat but hard to catch, they grow to a couple of pounds weight by the look of them from a distance are a grey color.
