Germany's Peace Note to America was answered in a very brilliant way. Pres Wilson said that he wanted to know first of all if the Central Powers definitely accepted his 14 15 points, & whether the Chancellor represented those who commenced & are carrying on the war, or not.
This effectively shows the significance of the German note, & will have the effect of making the Chancellor admit his duplicity or else the complete defeat of Germany. Incidentally it will bring the Chancellor right up against the 15 the Clause, which, states definitely that we will not treat with Hohenzollerns.
At present I am feeling rather stale as the effect result of overwork & under-exercise. To-morrow I am due for Leave to Abbeville so I shall try to shake the cobwebs off my head.
