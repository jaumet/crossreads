<p>rain so we waited for an Hour under the Trees &amp; then thinking that the rain had set in for the night started Home through it.  We got nice &amp; wet in 20 minutes &amp; then the rain ceased altogether.  But we have not suffered by the event in any way.  Next afternoon we had to leave for Home again as the Boat left at 6 a.m. on Monday.  So we sadly &amp; reluctantly said au Revoir at 5 p.m. to Gran &amp; Marie &amp; Auntie drove us down to Sulby Glen Station.</p>
<p>Well, Dad, I've to write to Mum, yet, so I'll finish the other bit in Her letter.  Love to all &amp; Kind Regards to Mr. Cocks &amp; Otto.</p>
<p>Your Fond Son<br/>Harry.</p>
