not listen to the cry of those who say "go slow" - no indeed, not till victory is ours must we slacken our efforts.  Sooner of later our men will again be in the forefront of the fight - they won't fail us & we must see that we don't fail them.  Let us not pause in our good work, & then when the poor wounded & sick soldiers need our gifts we will be able to supply their needs
