<p>off the wharf, through the town of Southampton, to the railway station  Here, again, we are accorded a great reception &amp; for the first time in 9 months I find the people around speaking English. It is really great to be "home"  The town of Southampton is rather pretty but small, but undoubtedly English    &amp; that's what counts. Left at 11-15 am for Waterloo Station, London. Passing good old country towns  pretty villages, fields &amp; farms on the way, all green &amp; we have a great day to wit. Soon see Electric trains bustle everywhere &amp; London have in sight  my first view of it being Westminster &amp; Houses of Parliament. Marched straight to Hdqus, Horseferry Rd, obtained passes, a cup of tea etc, gratis, at the Anzac Buffet (a charming little place) &amp; have forth to see London after receiving &pound;1 in pay on a/c. Take a bus ride to Muswell Hill, Highgate (long ride)    &amp; pass St Pauls; Strand; Lincoln's Inn; Bank of England etc en route. Most interesting. Take tube railway back to Charing Cross.  Put</p>
