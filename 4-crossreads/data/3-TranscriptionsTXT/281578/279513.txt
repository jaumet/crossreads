with the reinforcements in the villages on our way to join the battalions, was a grand chap, told me he had never been away from his battalion (a Tasmanian) one day on account of wounds or sickness, & had been in every stunt, but his turn has come now. Still another life gone in this cursed war! Thursday 23 May Went on sick parade today, as I want to get a couple of teeth stopped which got broken lately. The doctor gave me a chit for the dentist, & he fixed 'em up. I had to laugh to see Boo, he was on fatigue, picking up paper & rubbish in the gutter, it's a rum life in the army. Barney Davis & I used our nuts & had the afternoon off parade also, supposedly with the dentist, of course. Bought some chocolate at the canteen, & adjourned to a lovely park & ate it & had a read. At night there was a concert by the 4th Brigade Pierrots, it wasn't bad. Our billet has the usual space between the barn & house full of filth. & green scum, & a pig, & cow & horse are stalled around us - wish we were camped in the lovely green forest near the village, instead of in it in barns. Sat outside the door writing letters till it got dark at 10 p.m. Boo came along with a lovely lot of letters for me, as I was turning in. They were enclosed with his in an envelope from the Bank in London,
