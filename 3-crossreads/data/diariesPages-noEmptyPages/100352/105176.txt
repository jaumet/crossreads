them. They had been rather surprised, they said, that Australia should become their captor as they were unaware that we had a fleet or army. We arrived on the Berrima at about 3 oclock I received a letter from E. with another note enclosed. We received news of the sinking of AE2 by a German gunboat but this seems to be highly improbable. We are to sail for Wilhelmshafen in the morning the collier is now alongside.
The rest of "H" are to be left behind in Rabaul as they cannot reach here in time to sail with us. According to despatch riders they have had a rough time on their seventy mile march. The roads were in an awful condition the return with 60 bullock wagons (4 miles in length) with the German accoutrements is of necessity slow, tedious. It is also rumoured (with a fair amount of truth) that the "color" has struck a snag in the junior subaltern. There are several men ready for him when he our remnant meet.
