  
 11/8/17. Sec-Bois is a nice area. Have a comfortable billet and a very confined space to drill in, hence we occupy most of the time marching. Was paid today. The old soldiers do well here; by some mysterious means our ration of vegetables has been strongly reinforced, with, potatoes onions, carrots, cabbages, eschalots and other stuff such as is never issued by a fatherly government. I was presented with a young pig by a farmer in the 1st Battalions area; or strictly speaking I presented myself with it in his name which is much the same thing. He didn't see things in that light but raised Cain throughout the brigade. The porker was found done to a turn in our cookhouse. We had to pay for him, cost 5 Franc's apiece. It is sad, the way I fall into temptation  by the sight of anything edible. It is the same with all the rest of the boys
