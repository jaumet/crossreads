return of the incidents of the great campaign.I have not many thrilling experiences above the normal trench life because for the six months of its history we have been in trench warfare & only after I left did the Brigade go over the top in the present advance.  Had I remained with them, I should have had a great story to tell but one must try & regard these changes as providential.  I return to France next Thursday to my new Batt. & will commence a new diary of my doings & experiences when I get back.
