<p>after the heat of the day, the perfume from the budding flowers &amp; leaves was beautiful, &amp; we quite enjoyed it.  A few more hot days &amp; you wont know the country so fast is everything coming along, you can fairly see the wheat &amp; oats growing.<br/>Nothing but rumours &amp; latrines flying around they have got hold of all sorts of yarns, I heard someone saying that Fritz had got far as Baupaume &amp; had asked for an armistice, another one, that he has been knocked back pas Lagnicourt &amp; his old line, &amp; it was still going home, its funny but you always hear these sort of yarns whenever anything special is doing &amp; I have got that word to them that I take absolutely no notice of what I hear, &amp; not too much of what I see.</p>
