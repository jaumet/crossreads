 [Tuesday 31 October 1916] 
 Counting votes still   Went to see Sir Geo Reid &amp; gave him Sir Sam McCaughy's letter of introduction &amp; saw over the House of Commons- Dolly lunches with me each day- Nothing definite as to  when  a boat sails for Egypt. Laura is very thin &amp; does not like going up to Walsall she is I think quite satisfied that No 2 is not a success. English papers regret the Australian vote of NO after all Hughes' talk here. Don't mention what I say about how the soldiers voted as I am bound to secrecy.
