<p>During the afternoon we passed two Italian steamers and a French gunboat going in the opposite direction.  At 7pm the lighthouse outside A'xria could be observed right ahead and by 8pm we were half a mile from the entrance, when we had to anchor, owing to a pilot not being available till morning.<br/><u>Friday 21st May 1915.</u>  When I awakend this morning the ship was anchored in practically the identical spot she had anchored in on our first visit.  We are in the midst of transports some of which were with us at Nanzag.  After dinner I went up to town with Purser sent a cable, did a bit of shopping and had tea at the Windsor.  Returning to the ship about 5pm I wrote letters till bedtime.</p>
