<p>14 June 1915<br/>Monday 34 wks from home</p>
<p>It is rumored that we landed more troops between Gaba Tepe and Cape Hellas &amp; troopships were seen leaving there early this morning the Cruiser accounted for all the reinforcements, German) The enemy were bringing up a further heavy bombardment opened up this morning and our 6in gun did splendid work &ndash; also our lighter pieces.  One of our machine guns accounted for one of their 18 pounders yesterday another mail arrived at Alexandria have had a touch of fever today &amp; if not better in the morning will report to doctor French advanced 200 yds yesterday.  Col Chauvel was promoted to Brig Gen today &amp; he rightly deserves it.  Turks are still using the reversed ammunition.  Old mail comes to hand but none for me &amp; still none from Nell.  Officers vaccinated for cholera &amp; we are to be done shortly.  [indecipherable] Tomlins visited us today&amp;while he was in the clearing a shell knocked out one of his men &amp; wounded four others.</p>

<p>More arty [indecipherable] this morning &amp; their firing is fairly good, they have brought up a battery to within 400 yds of our trenches &amp; they blew our parapets to blazes, &amp; it took our chaps all night to repair them, Col Chauvel was taken away today with Pleurisy &amp; is pretty bad.  I met Ted Griff &amp; Geof Shep today down at the beach.  One of our destroyers shelled Gaba Tepe &amp; the enemy in return was dropping them all round her but that's as near as they got.  Two of our aeroplanes were busily engaged one in looking for submarines &amp; the other on reconnaissance the Turks dropped a shell or two pretty handy.  Influenza pretty prevalent with troops.  The circular regarding applications for commissions in regular &amp; territorial army has again been put before the troops with an urgent appeal to all COs to encourage men to go for them.  Corp Knight is still in the land of the living</p>
