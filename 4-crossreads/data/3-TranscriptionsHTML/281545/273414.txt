<p>I took a quiet stroll around the outskirts of the Town.   I passed the Church which had been hit &amp; badly damaged.   I had another look at the inside where everything is still the same as after the Bombardment, I then went down a side street were I came to the Poperinghe Cemetery as the Gates were locked &amp; the Brick Wall broken down alongside I climbed over &amp; went along the Path.   I was not long walking along when I soon noticed that the Tomb Stones had also been damaged by bombs &amp; shells.   All of a sudden I saw a Tomb smashed in &amp; on looking down inside what a sight there were, it was awful.   I could see the Coffins all smashed in, &amp; bodies all enclosed in Zinc Casings squashed up flat, in this tomb there were 12 Coffins laid on two tiers the bottom four were under water through the rain &amp; the top 4 were all smashed about &amp; pieces of wood floating in the water.  I turned away in horror to think such a cruel thing could have happened &amp; continued on &amp; came across several more Tombs knocked about the same, likewise several Head stones knocked down &amp; broken in pieces.   There is no mistake this Cemetery has had a bad knocking about.   I came across a large shell hole amongst a lot of Graves &amp; pieces of wood &amp; Human</p>
