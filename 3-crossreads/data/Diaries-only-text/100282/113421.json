Took over Battalion Orderly Sgt this evening
The Y.M C A. are giving to every member of our Forces a nice little pocket book it will come in very handy.
25th. Xmas Day true to its traditions it has been snowing, but only slightly. We expected to be called out last night, had orders to be ready to move off at half an hours notice, they were expecting the Germans to attack but happily nothing came of it. A lot of the lads were very merry last night I being B.O.S. was called out at 10.45. to go round quieten them a little, B. Coys Orderly room were the worst offenders closely followed by our officers, C.Coy. machine gunners, our little crowd were quiet for once in a while, Jack Hayes I played Jock Depina "bridge", we beat them by nearly 1400 points had a rare run of luck.
C.Coy had to find 2 working parties to move off early this morning bit stiff but the war can't stop just for Xmas.
