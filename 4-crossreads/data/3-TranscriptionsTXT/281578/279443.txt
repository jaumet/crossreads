big guns in the distance was very distinct this morning. These villages don't contain any lovely females, all the women seem to be old & fat, with big hips & one rarely sees any girls. The parts between the houses and the barns where the animals are housed & hay stored, is all muck & filth, manure &c.  & the streets are muddier than Codford, & that says a lot, but the heavy military traffic goes unceasingly. We tramped out about 2 miles to a paddock & had our rifles inspected & then came back again - its a great life alright. I struck a couple of Tommies who are cooking for an officer & a few of the staff - they belonged to the 9th Corps, but it was cut up by the Germans, & now they are with the Australians. I had a friendly chat (nothing like being with the cooks) & they gave me some steak & onions & potatoes for dinner,  tres bon it was too. The roar of the guns in the distance can still be heard like far off thunder & it kept on during the night without a break. Wednesday 10 April Slept pretty well, on the floor with hay & waterproof
