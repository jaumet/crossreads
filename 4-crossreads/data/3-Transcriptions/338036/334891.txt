<p>[8th April contd]<br/>During the afternoon we received the very sad news of the death of 3 of our boys and later the bodies put all our doubts to the wind.  They were Sgt Gus Dyer, Ernie Porter &amp; Harry Bridson.  Both the latter have brothers in the Amb.  It appears that were taking up the rations to Advance Dressing Station when a shell landed practically on them &amp; cut them up horibly.  I saw the bodies &amp; they were a sight.<br/>Previous ration carts had had narrow escapes &amp; it was wondered that the sending of rations during daylight still continued.  Gas drill later.</p>
<p>Monday 9th  [April]<br/>Sleet falling &amp; snowing &amp; cold all day.</p>
