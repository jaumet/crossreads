<p>Part 1<br/>From the 1st of July 1916 until about November 22nd  1916</p>
<p>Concerning the trip from Sydney to Plymouth in the White Star Liner S.S.Ceramic and also my different movements while in Camps in N.S.W.</p>
<p>On July 1st 1916 I fancied that I would very much like a trip to the War which had been then raging about 2 years.<br/>I enlisted at the Victoria Barracks Paddington &amp; was granted four days in which to do all that had to be done before I went to Camp. I had not many things to arrange so it left me free to enjoy the last few days of civilian life at my disposal before I became a Soldier &amp; donned the khaki. It turned out that these four days were to be my last days of freedom for almost three years.</p>
<p>On the 5th day of July I joined the Australian Expeditionary force Camp at the Sydney show Ground &amp; stopped there till the 8th. I was inoculated against fever while I was there &amp; was also Vaccinated against Smallpox as well. We were all given three blankets &amp; a waterproof sheet to sleep with, My quarters was the building used for the Draft Horse Exibits.</p>
