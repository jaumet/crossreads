 Sunday 8 July 1917. 
 Still in hospital. Fair this morning. 
 On the general parade ground all the troops paraded in review order and were splendidly addressed by a Brigadier General (Royston) who has charge of part of the Australian troops in this part of the war. He inspected the men almost individually, and seemed as pleased with the men as the men were with him. In conclusion the troops gave him &quot;3 hearty cheers&quot;.
