<p>Sunday 16/5/15. I am now in the convalescent hospital I have been here about 4 days and my wound is rapidly improving. The sea is only a couple of hundred yards away and I often spend a couple of hours down there. I went down to the base yesterday and got some of my own clothing from my kit bag. I went to the barbers to-day and had a shave and a hair cut. Eastern barbers contrast painfully with those who carry on according to the western idea of doing things. The chair is of the ordinary sort except that it has a permanent cross piece at the back. This convenience is only moveable vertically. The lather merchant that I visited to-day uses a rusty nail to hold it in place. Hot water is not to be thought of and the brush is never washed.  Ordinary soap is used. When he strops the scraping could be heard at 100 yards. Its a toss up between the razor and a saucepan lid. The manipulator of the brush and blade dashes the soap on and scrapes it off again in this most cheerfully unconcerned manner. What the razor wont cut it will drag out is the philosophy.
