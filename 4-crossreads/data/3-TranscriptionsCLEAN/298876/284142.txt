The Light Houses at night are very pretty.
X One of the Officers said they heard distinct firing on the shore above Fort - and believed it was the "allies" engaged in a skirmish as the Turks were trying to break through to the red sea & construct submarines.
Very busy all night in the Hospital - men coming in at all hours - 3 of the crew paraded sick at midnight shift with ptomaine poisoning - One star shines of an night is equal almost to a new moon.
X Don't know what the Brand was he was drinking.
