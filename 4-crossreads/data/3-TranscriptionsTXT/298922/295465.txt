Some Gift stuff for the men given out. It would add value to every article if some one's name was on it - as the idea that it is a personal gift appeals to all ranks as much as the value.
Heavy Dust storm last night - I must be getting nervy - Coz, a cricket walked over my face & I sprang 2 ft. out of my Blankets - thinking it was a SCORPION. At one HUT yesterday I found 20 Cisterns or SILOS about 12 ft. deep 6' wide & a manhole to enter. These Holes are used to store the grain in, it seems to keep all right. I wonder how it would work in our country.
