The name of Anzac will bequeath an heritage of honour to be handed down to future generations of the Australian & New Zealand people.  Innumerable deeds of bravery, of heroic sacrifice & of mutual friendships some of which are  [indecipherable], forgotten, were committed there on the memorable 25th April 1915.

During the early days all the necessaires of warfare were packed up on the beach & hillside, - all equipment, supply food stores, guns, wood, and ambulance
