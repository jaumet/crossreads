March 5thArrived at Ashar the port as it were of Bazrah.  A long line of fine piers has been erected by the British to which are buoyed many large boats.
We disembark and go on to various camps.  My particular one is at Makench where some of us camp with some Tommy ASC people.  Latchford, Mills, Hitchcock, Turner, Hooper, Cameron, Stewart - Fraser and others there. The mud is a good foot thick all around & a great deal of work was required before we could say that we were comfy.
The ASC birds seem fairly decent, their food is not of the best, but the bar is excellent.
