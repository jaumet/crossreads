<p>Feb. Sunday 4 1917</p>
<p>Nothing of import happens. The usual shelling takes place. I'm put on to help in Dressing Room as far as back allows. Still sore &amp; painful to move about.  More changing over of posts. Remainder of B Sec. changed places with A. <br/>Heavy frosts still continue, this possie is a cold miserable hole.  The dugout is wet &amp; our rations scarce.</p>
