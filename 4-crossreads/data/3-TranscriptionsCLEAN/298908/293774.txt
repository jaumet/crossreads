  
 only knows what the French think of him & I'd like to know old Fritzies honest opinion. Went down last night to Sutton Veney purposely to see the picture of the Conn & Wilde fight which took place in London a few weeks back, from what I could see of it I should think that the whole thing was a fraud & I don't believe Conn tried a bit. Nearly all the Sgts. in our hut tonight are complaining of a sore throat I know I have one I wonder what the dickens can be the cause of it, the majority seem to favour the sudden change in the weather, it is much warmer tonight again than last night perhaps that may have something to do with it. 
 3rd.  A cold wind has been blowing all the day & its cutting right to the bone, winter is coming fast luckily tonight they are issuing an extra blanket per man & very nice they will be, this makes 4 per man.
