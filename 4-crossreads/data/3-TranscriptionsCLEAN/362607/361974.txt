15.8.17Dear Mum, Dad & George, These are the Gardens in which I am writing this P.C. Dad may remember the spot with Wellingtons Tall Monument just a bit up the street. We have had lots of Thundery weather lately & the rain has been very heavy.Well, I must go down to the Landing Stage now. There are lots of Travellers to the Isle of Man now & I want to get a good position & make myself comfortable before I start.Best wishes to all my Friends & Good Health & Happiness be yours always even though we are so far away & can't look after you.   Love Harry.
