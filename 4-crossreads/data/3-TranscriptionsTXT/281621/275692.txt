April, 1917Sunday 1 Palm SundayUnit equipage. Patients begin to move up to Aveluy just the other side of Albert. Last night the Germans bombed Albert, no casualties.
Monday 2Movement in progress & to finish tomorrow. I am still at Buire but will most likely move tomorrow. The weather here is as typical as described. Rain, sleet, snow & sunshine within a few hours.
Tuesday 3At Buire still but expect to move to Aveluy tomorrow. The unit moves to Bazentin again in a few days.
Wednesday 4It is now decided that we will remain here & leave & join the unit at Bazentin on Friday.
Thursday 5Tomorrow Good Friday & I have visions of Sydney Station & crowded mountain trains. Had some special pastry made by an excellent French cook. Beautiful day & night.
Friday 6Move this morning from Buire to Bazentin again. The guns can just be heard from here. Beautiful day & the sky larks are going their hardest. Move tomorrow to Bapaume.
Saturday 7Out of the Somme & once more in Pas de Calais. We moved from Bazentin via Flers, Le Roque Tilloy to Bapaume. This town now 7 miles remote from the line is in a very battered condition & is still shelled by Fritz. About the size of Albert but it seems a better class of town. Guns can be distinctly heard. The neighbouring country is not in a bad state at all. M.D.S.
