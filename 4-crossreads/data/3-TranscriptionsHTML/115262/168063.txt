<p>Still on the move and travelled till 4 a.m. most of the time through enemy country when hardly a sound was heard. (None allowed) Lay down when we halted at 4 a.m&nbsp;and slept till dawn &amp; were awakened by an explosion of a mine of the engineers sinking a well.</p>
<p>Camped in the waddy and prepared a rough meal which we cooked ourselves. Our position is <s>near</s> on the left Sth East flank of Birsheebah &amp; 5 miles from the front Turkish trenches. Bedouins captured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Near the ruins of an old city built ages ago by King Constantine 1600 yrs <s>ago</s> B.C.</p>
