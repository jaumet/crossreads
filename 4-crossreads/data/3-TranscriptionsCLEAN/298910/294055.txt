Convent Wall for water & while pumping, the dirty wretches nearly sniped me. I came away with half the quantity I wanted. I will try & find out particulars of the Convent, which has been a very large one , all that remains are a few heaps of bricks & stones - & a sort of court yard but 1/4 mile square with a high brick wall some 12ft high, standing where not broken by shells, you can plainly see the remains of a beautiful gate & a substantial marble arch. It is here the Germans I believe carried out their shocking outrages. Used to be the Crown Princes Headquarters.
