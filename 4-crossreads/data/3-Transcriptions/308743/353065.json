<p>21 November 1914<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Revielle at 6<br/>Great consternation existed among the ships of the third division for one of the ships during the night dropped a man overboard &amp; when the lifeboat was launched the ship hadn't stopped &amp; capsized the boat &amp; drowned all the crew. The warships have been searching the water by the aid of their search-lights &amp; then when daylight appeared searched &amp; parolled the locality for quite a while. The ships of 12 knots &amp; over have gone on as specified yesterday &amp; by 6 tonight were out of sight. The remainder of the troops got inoculated this afternoon &amp; now sore arms are very prevalent especially mine it's a dead pain with feverish accompaniment. Had a pleasant talk concerning home ties with Corp Holland. Was Canteen Corp again tonight but didn't see one of our chaps. The boss is a little better today worse luck.

<p>Revielle at 5.30<br/>Had an unpleasant night for the inoculation troubled me that much that I lost all my sleep &amp; consequently feel washed out. Church Parade was held this morning &amp; as we were off stables I attended it. The warship has been very erratic all day &amp; the [indecipherable] likewise. We ran into a storm this morning &amp; it broke the monotony of fine weather. Had quite a change for dinner in mutton peas potatoes &amp; plum pudding quite a royal feed. The niggers paraded for inspection by their Captain &amp; right royal did the two castes look. All the jack-tars were having church when their boat passed us &amp; it looked like a huge cloud of white that had settled on the deck. Today at 11 we were 1200 miles from Colombo &amp; at 9 in the morning we expect to sight a Cape on the coast of Africa, also we are not going to call in at Aden but go on to Suez. Bed at 9.</p>
