 1700 letters up till leaving England. 
 4 June, Wednesday 
 F. Lovely day &amp; a little ground swell. We stop to take in Mine-destoyers. We have an inspection like a sea-serpent. Boat drill but I don't go on. We are very busy upstairs. I come downstairs very tired &amp; go straight to bed. 
 5 June, Thursday 
 F. Sea choppy but we make good headway with sea behind us. Pass 2 ships about 10 am, my afternoon off. I go below to read &amp; write. I develop awful headache &amp; nothing will relieve it so I go to bed all afternoon &amp; evening.
