<p>MARCHING SONG<br/>Of the RIFLEMEN'S BATTALION (36th)<br/>Words and Melody by Bandsman Sidney Young, 36th Batt. Band.<br/>Music Arranged by Edward H. Tyrrell, F.V.C.M.</p>
<p>Riflemen of every class unite in one endeavour,<br/>Pouring from bush and towns to fight for liberty;<br/>Vict'ry or death be the watchword, forever<br/>While the Flag of Britain flies Carmichael's Boys will be:</p>
<p>CHORUS<br/>Answering their Country in her Call for Men to go,<br/>Leaving aching hearts behind, to fight a foreign foe;<br/>They'll miss their Rifle Heroes, but ne'er would bid them stay,<br/>In their hearts they love the dear old Flag, like Rifle Boys to-day!</p>
<p>When they say their last good-byes and march away to glory,<br/>Headed by their Band, they go like sons of the brave;<br/>History will tell us the Riflemen's story,<br/>How he ventured all to win or die, his Land to save.</p>
