<p>[At the top of this and following pages of this letter is the letter M. Not transcribed.]</p>
<p>Last night I saw Colonel McGlynn [McGlinn], brother to the McGlynn girls of Maitland.  He is a Lieutenant Colonel, Brigade Major to Colonel Monash, an officer from Victoria.  Jack Patrick (McGlynn) was looking well, as fat as ever.  He is an officer of the first rank, who if he gets safe through will, I am sure, have a record of the best behind him.  Good luck to him!</p>
<p>I enclose you a newspaper cutting, which interested me this morning, when I read it in the Egyptian Gazette.  The uncorrupted Turk was a man of first class fighting quality whose prowess &amp; powers made him a dominant factor in the world.  The majority of those who now represent such men as live at Konieh are a degenerate lot who are no good for themselves, useless to others, &amp; cannot command respect, and who must pay the penalty of their own misdeeds and for their departure from that mode of thought and action which become worthy men.</p>
<p>Just saw a bundle of letters laid on the table of the outer office.  Hope within me rose at once.  Are there any for me?  "Oh these letters are the ones that have come here by mistake, they are for No 1 hospital, we are about to place them in a parcel that they may be taken to Heliopolis by motor car  which is just starting from our door."  Hope dashed to the ground once more.</p>
<p>Had not thought that you would be the recipient of another letter written by me anterior to our leaving Mena House, but as some one else disposes of my time &amp; arranges the place in the world of my duties during these halcyon days of war, you may about Easter time or soon thereafter have these pages in your hands.  Hope that you will like them.</p>
