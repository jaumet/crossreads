<p>Menin Road, Hell-fire Corner, Burr Cross Roads, Dickybush, and White Chateau are all in this locality and are well known as pretty warm places, to say nothing of what remained of the town of Ypres.</p>
<p>Aerial business during the day was greatly in evidence here also.</p>
<p>I had thought the Somme pretty hot, but this place beat everything.&nbsp; There was no monotony here, it was like a second hand shop, everything of every kind was procurable and the fortnight spent there was one of continuous excitement and exercise.</p>
<p>It was with feelings of great relief that at last we moved away from here to</p>
<p><u>SCOTTISH LINES</u>.</p>
<p>a camp a few miles &quot;back&quot;, but in a decidedly &quot;cooler&quot; locality.&nbsp; Huts were here completely surrounded by the inevitable mud, but it was peaceful compared with the place we had just left.&nbsp; We only remain here a couple of days and then move again to the peaceful and charming village of</p>
<p><u>BOMY</u>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we do not occupy the same billets as on our last visit here, but I do not fail to renew acquaintance with the family who had made my last stay <s>here</s> so enjoyable.</p>
<p>It appears that we are going to remain &quot;out&quot; for a considerable time, and that we shortly shall move &quot;back&quot; still further.</p>
<p>After remaining here for about a fortnight, we move to a beautiful chateau at</p>
<p><u>REGNIER EGLUSE</u>.</p>
<p>On our way here we pass through the old town of Crecy, and see the historic battlefield on which is erected a monument to commemorate same.</p>
<p>The whole trip is done by lorries - is most interesting and instructive.&nbsp; Makes one think if only he could do the same at his leisure, what an enjoyable time he could have.</p>
<p>Only a few days do we remain here.&nbsp; What a glorious home it is!</p>
