at Cambridge. This has suited me admirably and I am hoping not to have any return of the knee trouble.
I am feeling generally pretty fit all round and that makes me all the more ready for a return to work at the front as soon as the powers care to send me back.
Glad to hear Caesar is still well & came safely through the very heavy fighting on the Ypres salient front last Oct. & Nov. I look forward to hearing of him as a battalion Commander.

With affectionate regards to you allYours very sincerely[indecipherable]
