want him to be adopted by the 3rd Aus. Hospital if it were possible - we sisters would like it too for he is a well spoken refined little fellow. His mother is dead. His father & brother are in Egypt. We hear that the Captain is bound to send him back from Colombo.This morning we had a full parade of the 3rd Aus Hep unit. Twas an outdoor uniform affair - we filled the spacious 1st Class Dining Saloon. After the roll was called Colonel Fiaschi gave a short address to us all. There was the Officers, Sisters, Non-Commissioned officers & men. He strongly impressed on us the mission of our work and now that we had left Aus behind there was no such thing as States between us - just a united Aus. Unit going forth ready to give our best for the Empire. I think we all felt proud to be a mite in the unit. I know I did and especially when I glanced around & saw the familiar faces of Drs Cudmore & de Crespigny.Enough for tonight. My room mate will be wondering what has become of me. Good night all.
