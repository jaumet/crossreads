trench being really formed by what was called the "dug out" also built up of Sand bags with an iron roof protected also by Sand bags, forming a small room for men off duty to rest & sleep. On the outside of these "dug outs" a line of duck boards ran the whole length of the trench for easy walking.
The parapet was about 10 or 11 feet high with a fire step of about 3'.6" to 4 feet from the ground running the whole length of the "bay". Each trench had a receptacle for all the rifles with bayonets fixed, two receptacles for bombs, one for ammunition, with a large reserve stock of ammunition underneath the fire step. Also a periscope.
As soon as the men were all placed in the "bays" sentries were posted & reliefs "told off" to do the work continuously night & day.
As a preliminary all the men had to "Stand to" Every man had to take up a position in the bottom of the trench in "battle order" - & this equipment is never supposed to be taken off while "in the line", whether awake or asleep. With his rifles (with bayonet fixed) at the "At Ease" position & every man has to remain "Standing to" till the order comes to "Stand  Down" Usually the Stand to commences at about 3 oclock in the morning & ends shortly after dawn and again just after dusk in the evening for about an hour.
This night "Stand Down" was given as soon as it was seen that every man was in his place & understood his work for the night. Of course the sentries "on post" remain on the fire step Instructions were given that a continuous fire had to be kept up but firing was only to be done when a "target" appeared
When "Stand Down" was given most of the men waited patiently to observe how the sentries acted & as soon as either one would be seen to be getting ready for a "shot" curiosity & wonder became very keen. When the shot was fired, two or three of those below would at once whisper "What was it" "Did you hit him". My word! I hope you got the Cow!
