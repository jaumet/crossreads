<p>27th Aug.<br/>I am in high glee because of being sent away from this place, away from the red tape &amp; show, no one knows how I long to get into one of our own hospital among people who look after their patients rather than their wards.  I am going to No. 24 General at Etaples for an operation which for some reason they do not want to perform here.</p>
<p>I am the only Australian in this ward and the English nurses &ndash; who evidently have had little to do with Australians treat me as a kind of joke while the orderlies regard me as something strange to say the least of it.</p>
<p>However I am soon leaving &amp; so long as I'm not sent up the line I don't much</p>
