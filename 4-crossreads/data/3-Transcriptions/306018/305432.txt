<p>May 1917<br/>Sunday 20th<br/>Took out our horses to graze in the morning.  The wind changed to the NW but is still blowing dust fairly strong.  Church parade in the morning.</p>
<p>Monday 21st<br/>We grazed again in the morning.  The grass is drying up &amp; there is very little left now.  The quantity of the feed that is issued is very little.  In the evening B Troop went on guard on the water supply at Gamli.  It is a good job we got a chance to have a bath &amp; wash our clothes.</p>
<p>Tuesday 22nd<br/>We were relieved at 9 am &amp; came back to camp to get ready for a stunt at 2 oclock.  The 6th were attached to the 1st Brigade &amp; we left the wadi at 3 oclock, travelled SE till 6.  Watered &amp; fed our horses &amp; on again at 8.  The night was warm but night marches are always unpleasant.  Everyone is tired of the constant stopping &amp; moving soon gets horses &amp; men ill tempered.  At 2 oclock we stopped &amp; put out outposts.</p>
<p>Wednesday 23rd<br/>Moved on further at daybreak.  Our Regt halted 2 miles NE of Khalasa while the 1st Bgde &amp; Engineers went further South to the Railway line.  For hours they blew up the line, smashing each rail also demolishing a 9 span viaduct</p>
