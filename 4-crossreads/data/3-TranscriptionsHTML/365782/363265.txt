<p>I saw her eyes as she came near.<br/>Great Love, in that strange quivering light,<br/>Burned through them with a steady flame<br/>Her voice was low, yet I could hear<br/>Her call his name.</p>
<p>She from her fears got no relief<br/>And yet her face was dry of tears.<br/>But when she kneeled beside the dead<br/>For pity of some other's grief<br/>She bowed her head.</p>
<p>She paused and eyed each sleeping one,<br/>Her lips were murmuring a prayer,<br/>Weaved round that name more audible.<br/>Were he her lover or her son<br/>I could not tell.</p>
<p>And with that glance she passed us by.<br/>I turned, and watched her climb the hill<br/>In one white burst of flame she shone.<br/>Sharp out she stood against the sky,<br/>And she was gone</p>
<p>The dark was drizzling when we woke,<br/>And stood to arms.  "Was it a dream?"<br/>And still that question rang and rang.<br/>Near bye a bird, as daylight broke,<br/>For answer sang.</p>
