<p>March 1918<br/>Had a sleep after dinner and about 3.30 Long &amp; myself went out to Heliopolis &amp; had afternoon tea with Mrs &amp; Miss Curtis.  They are very nice people being friends of Mr &amp; Mrs Gunn of Alexandria.  It was them that wanted us to call.  We went on to Briggs where we had a nice dinner &amp; lefty for home at about 10.30.  There was a terrible crowd in Cairo.  Sunday night is the night most people seem to go to the pictures &amp; other places of amusement.  It was hard making headway through the crowd when we left the tram.</p>
<p>Monday 4th<br/>Was quiet busy all the morning.  The warm weather makes one lazy &amp; inclined to sleep.  It is quite a custom here to sleep after lunch.  All the shops close till 3 &amp; 3.30.  We dont start work till 5 pm, so manage to get in a decent sleep if we want to.  During the hot weather people shutter up their houses during the day</p>
