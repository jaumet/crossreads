  
  3rd Lon. Gen. Hospital London 4.9.17 My dearest Sister, Dont use the above address when writing to me - address as before to the Bn. as I will be back with them shortly. I have to see an ear, nose & throat specialist this afternoon. I believe the left antrum is affected - I am just dreading it as my experience of E.N. & T. doctors is still vivid & I hate those horrid things they shove up ones nose etc. Anyway I wont close this until after I see him so will know the worst. I am awfully fed up getting knocked out like this. Fancy missing injury in all our last stunts & when we come to rest to get hurt at football. I didnt really want to get away from the Bn. just yet. Just back
