<p>fatigue (engineers): a few whizz-bangs came a bit close while working: knocked off &frac14; to 12 &amp; "imshied". Alf had a letter for me from J.B.J. &amp; it was a real sensible &amp; breezy letter &amp; very acceptable as I can't get them from Aust at all: packed up my kit &amp; then wrote a reply: moved off about 8.30 pm &amp; took over centre Coy position: this is not a bad traverse being just rebuilt: a "coal box" got in a few days ago &amp; splathered it: necessitating the rebuilding: out of the six men in four were killed &amp; two woundered. there are plenty of gore stains about even now: we are pretty short handed &amp; reinf will be acceptable I had a good look at a "Lewis" &amp; they are quite simple to work: Fritz was pretty liberal with his flares: we did not send up one on our Coy's front:</p>
<p>Sunday June 4th <br/>in the firing line: cold cloudy day: nothing much doing till dinner time: a very heavy bombardment over St Eloi way in early morning the sky was lit up like continual lightning flashes by the guns: heard that we had a licking on the North Sea &amp; hope it is a latrine: in afternoon Fritz bogged into our line on left &amp; right &amp; our guns bogged into him, I think we got the "verdict": We had to go out listening at 9.15 pm &amp; came in 12.30 am. It was not too bad only cold: plenty of nettles out in No mans land &amp; they were not too pleasant: a party was fixing up our wire: Gee! but there is some wire there: we could hear Fritz working in front &amp; on our right: but did not see anything: a violent bombardment started  down La Bassie way &amp; there were certainly some guns like continual thunder &amp; the flashes were like continual lightning: Fritz got a bit nervy then &amp; started sending</p>
