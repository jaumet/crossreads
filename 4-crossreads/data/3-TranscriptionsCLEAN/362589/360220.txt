  
 Gallipoli 20th Nov 1915 
 My dear Father What with the appearance of nice cold bracing weather, the disappearance of flies & smells &  the budgets of good news we have been getting the last few days, I'm as happy as the proverbial "bug in a rug". Most of yesterday afternoon I spent arguing  that  with the doctor about the present situation & he put an end to the discussion by telling me that  over  excessive optimism was one of the first signs of insanity. This afternoon, still being in an argumentative state of mind, I sparred with my company commander about the meaning of a passage in Kings Rep. I'm pretty certain that I was wrong myself - at the beginning I was quite certain - but two hours talking brought my B.C. round & made me very doubtful. All of us are very well, the cold weather is improving the general health of our battalion, &, we hope, playing old  Happy  Harry with the ill equipped Turk. Kitchener was up here a few days ago, but as he did not enquire about me, I was offended & refused to go & see him. I hope this letter does not meet with the same fate as its predecessors, if it does please let me know, & I'll write another to take its place dating it  [indecipherable]  back to the 20th. Yrs. Affect son Arthur.
