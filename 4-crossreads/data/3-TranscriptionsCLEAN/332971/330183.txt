  
 taking baby to Italy where the Colonel's sister is going to take charge of her & Mrs Fiaschi proposes coming back & rejoining the unit at Lemnos to continue her nursing.  I will wait & see her safely off from here then go on to Lemnos.  Sometimes I wonder if any hitch will crop up to prevent me going, but I do trust not.  All being well we leave the Hospital to-morrow week, stay a few days at the Majestic Hotel waiting for the Italian boat which goes on the 7th of October. To-day am dreadfully home sick for letters.  Tomorrow afternoon Sister Burns & I are looking forward to a happy time at Abonkir Bay. I am so glad that you have had such a good winter.  All must be rejoicing at the promising harvest I can picture the spring time out there & with everything so beautiful around you it is difficult to realise all the suffering that this terrible war involves over here & I feel heart sick when I think of Australia being drained of all its best men. Good bye once again- I'll just say how very glad I am that I came & when our work is done how very very glad I will be to get back again- there's no place like home.  Hoping all is well c you.  With the best of best wishes Sincerely yours A.Donnell My future address is- Sister Donnell                 3rd Australian General Hospital           A.I.F.
