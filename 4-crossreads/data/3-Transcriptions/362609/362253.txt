<p>Tuesday 4 April 1916<br/>After the glimpse we had caught of France last evening everyone was up early and excited at the thought of what the day might bring forth. It turned out to be fine but cold and cloudy. When we got on deck we found that we were in smooth water close to a small island on which stood a lighthouse. Further distant was the rocky coastline where in places the white cliffs indicated a chalky formation. The calm water made us wonder whether somewhere out of sight to seaward there was not a breakwater to add protection to the open bay.<br/>Several fishing boats of a heavy build and with a long prow passed us, manned by fishermen (usually 2) dressed in rough jerseys and big sea boots wearing a red cap with a tassel on top. The long sweeps used by the men standing and facing in the direction taken, but it seemed that progress was slow. The nets were piled up in the stern and a silver gleam in the bottom of the boats showed that they had not toiled in vain.<br/>As the "Transylvania" came close to shore we had some very pretty peeps of the landscape. The blue water of the Mediterranean gave place to white cliffs surmounted by fertile fields in which after the dreary deserts of Egypt, the luxuriant growth of vegetation was most striking. There were all gradations of colour, from the verdant green of the grass and cultivation patches to the gloomy shades of the pines and cypresses. Here and there villas with red tiled roofs stood out in bold contrast and in one or two spots the white gleam of bell-tents arranged in orderly rows showed where some of our camps were situated.<br/>The scattered dwellings gave place to the continuous habitations of Marseilles as we proceeded up the bay. Finally we came to the quays were a mass of shipping was to be seen. As we made our way slowly past, one steamer the "La France" was noticed on which we had our first sight of the steel grey German uniform. This was worn by prisoners of war who under an armed guard were loading or unloading the cargo. Nearby was a huge vessel beside which our vessel and all others looked mere midgets. It was the "Brittania" a 40,000(?) tonnes painted after the manner of hospital ships, white with a green longitudinal band interrupted at intervals with red crosses. We were told that she acts almost as a hospital base, other hospital ships bringing their boats of sick and wounded to be transferred to the giant ship and taken by her to the home country. All quays were scenes of bustle and activity even at this early hour of the morning.</p>
