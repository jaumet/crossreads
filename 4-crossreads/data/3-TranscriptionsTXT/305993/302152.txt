 New Years day Fine weather prevailed but rather cold the temperature down to 38 during the day &amp; 33 during the night.  The Bulgarians by what I could gather from those that could speak English, were very sorry that they were mislead &amp; having joined Germany in the war &amp; did not care much for the French but were very friendly with the British.  Varna contained hundreds of German troops until recently &amp; occupied the place for 2 years paying for goods in their paper money which is worthless at present.  After the Armistice they became rough &amp; treated the Bulgarians badly, took the best part of the food stuffs away &amp; whilst there each soldier was compelled to buy so much food &amp; send it to their relations in Germany each week.  All the shops at Varna were closed having nothing to sell, matches 7d a box, boots &pound;3 a pair &amp; other commodities similar.  Yet food stuffs was fairly good during the war being a producing country.  The forts &amp; all Military bases have been garrisoned by the British troops.  The Bulgarian soldiers disarmed &amp; strolling around the streets quite harmless &amp; unconcerned.  The British tommy similar a strong patrol well armed parading the town night &amp; day.  The harbor &amp; houses are well laid out &amp; of the latest principle.
