<p>had all got home. The wretches! I have just finished reading a book called &quot;A wife out of Egypt&quot; and was jolly interested it&nbsp;as it is all about the places I have seen here, and also has a lot of the feelings in it about Cairo that I have felt, though I suppose most people would say it was rather bitter - but I agree with it that, although individual English people&nbsp;are alright; as a class in Cairo they are rotters. After all said and done I have been writing up a few things about our Assuan stunt to send along with the photos. It may be some time before I get home with the guide book, and I know you are interested in anything I am interested in! The thing that annoys me about writing one of those &quot;young books&quot; about any place is that when you thinks of Sam Wellers remark &quot;She&#39;ll wish there was more, and that&#39;s the great art of letter writing&quot; you see what complete failures they are. of course Sam had never been to Luxor or Assuan; so perhaps he was not qualified to judge, but I&#39;m afraid letter writing is an art I unfortunately dont possess. Latest rumour has it the 1st Bde is going early in March so we still may be home soon! I&#39;ll send you a cable when I&#39;m leaving if possible.</p>
