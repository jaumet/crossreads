In the afternoon we went the YMCA River trip. We sailed up the River Siene as far as the junction of the River Marne then we sailed back down again passing under the thirty seven bridges which cross the River near Paris, till we reached a place called St Cloud. We got off the boat at this place and spent an hour or so walking through the grounds after having our photo taken at the Cascades. We then returned back down the river to the landing stage at the Place de la Concord. The people of Paris are on holiday to-day, owing to some religious celebration in the R.C. Church. Some Saint or other I suppose.
We got a good view of the city from St Cloud which is very high lying.
In the evening we went with two friends to a Cinema. Just before the Cinema ended the Alert was sounded and the people in the hall arose in one body and went orderly out of the place without any panic. This alert is sounded when an air raid is expected Paris has had quite a number of visits from Fritz bombers. One of the officers, Capt H. belonging to our unit, was wounded by a bomb, while he was on a visit to Paris.
