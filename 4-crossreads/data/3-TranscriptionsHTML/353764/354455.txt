<p>24.4.16 Easter Monday<br/>Things are very much the same, that is plenty of hard work to get the Camp straightened out &amp; I am feeling very tired.<br/>I received 6 letters to day from home all addressed to my new Unit &amp; was exceedingly fortunate as all those who did not Cable their new address did not receive any as their letters have gone to the new 20th which is in France.<br/>The Weather continues to grow warmer &amp; in the middle of the day it is practically unbearable.</p>
<p>A strange thing is the unquenchable thirst that seizes everyone, &amp; the unfortunate part is that we are not allowed to drink much water on account of disease &amp; practically live on Lemonade &amp; Shandies &amp; very seldom drink plain water.  Lots of our chaps are going down to sickness &amp; at the present time there are 30 in Hospital.<br/>Tomorrow is a big day in Egypt it being the Anniversary of the Landing.</p>
