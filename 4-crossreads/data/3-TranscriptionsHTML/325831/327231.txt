<p>2.<br/>The pensive vision in the armchair comes first. I saw a man the other day in a very secure dugout who looked exactly like that. The fact was being bourne in upon him very unpleasantly that some weeks had elapsed since his last bath.

<p>The next picture suffered owing to the photographer proving too interesting to the victims. Dorothy is in a state of open mouthed petrification, while there is a painful air of expectancy which makes one desire to seratch.</p>
<p>No 3 isn't a success &amp; Dorothy is the culprit once more. Instead of laughing like a rational human being, she is slinging the glad eyes to the man at the wheel.</p>
<p>Then we come to the male members of the party. What an air of great sublimity suffices the whole picture as like a Sunday school picnic. Father doesn't look as virtuous as he might, &amp; Blue &amp; Geo are liable to bubble over &amp; do something rash at any minute. Mais le tout-ensrinble, c'est magnifique!</p>
<p>I'm afraid I have written too large &amp; have left no room to describe the last which is wonderful</p>

<p>The situation is normal out here, but the temperature considerably below normal.</p>
<p>Remember me to 'em all not forgetting Mrs O'Reilly.</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
