<p>battalion. They have a very fine cathedral, but the interior is not so good as that of Amiens, the outside is very old looking &amp; crumbling with age. Tea I had at a soldiers place only cost 1F.<br/>The Seine is a fairly wild river plenty of craft on it, there are very fine bridges.<br/>Jan 31st Rest Camp<br/>Arrived at this camp last night, we are in bell tents. It is snowing again. We had a parade at 9 Am, roll call only. We will probably be leaving for Etaples tomorrow 11 Am<br/>Feb. 6th 17 [No6 ICD?]<br/>Rouen<br/>Have been in this camp a week this afternoon. They cannot get us away on account of the traffic on the railways &amp; also they say that the base is crowded with new troops. There is a lot of talk of us being here for about a month. Wrote to the base asking them to hangon to my letters. There are all sorts of troops here, we are formed up into companies, we are having a fairly easy time, fall in at 11 am for route march, the rest of the day we have to ourselves.</p>
