12th April.
Well here we are again; since dipping into you last, little notebook, we have been all round the world.  At least so it seems to me  We were supporting the French at Gentilles Wood  we bib bivouced bivouaiced there for three days.  We were then marched six miles across country to the village of Aubigny  Tis indeed a pathetic sight, these hastily abandoned villages.
