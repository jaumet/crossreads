First port of call was Albany but no troops were allowed ashore. From here 1 man was sent back to Melbourne for medical reasons. Next Port of call was Colombo. The order was No Troops to land but quite a number broke ship. (The line of Ships in this convoy were a fine sight. Towing the submarine AE11 the Berrima always seemed to be secure from attack). Fortunately we were kept busy from 5.30 A.M.untill 5.30 P.M. which kept our minds from wandering homewards. 5.30 AM Reveille Clear Decks ? Fold Hammocks and fall in at 6.30. Physical exercise until 7-15 Breakfast 7-30 ? Fall in 9 A.M. Training, Rifle, Lectures etc to 12 Dinner 12.30 ? Fall in 2 P.M. Training to 4.30. Tea 5 P.M. Many of the men availed themselves of classes for N.C.Os and French lessons at night. Passing through the Suez Canal men had their first experience of War. The Turks had made an attempt on the Canal and shells were dropped into Bitter Lakes soon after our Boat had pulled out. Men were posted round the ship in case of an attack. The feeling on Board was a hope of a scrap. We reached Alexandria without further mishap and our hopes unfulfilled on 1st. Febuary and disembarked for Abbassia per train on 2nd. February 1915. The first night spent in Camp was bitter cold and as we were without blankets we felt it severley.
