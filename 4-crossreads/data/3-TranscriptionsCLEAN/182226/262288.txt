 Leon Ferguson wounded. 
 The big shed caught fire, several chaps were burnt out of house & home i.e. their rifles, equipment & overcoats went. 
 The ships were very active during the night & sent a number of heavy shells into the Turks. 
 We are building a new cook house for the cook to keep out the weather. 
 It was very cold during the night & windy in the evening.
