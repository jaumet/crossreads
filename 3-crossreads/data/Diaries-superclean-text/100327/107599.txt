28/9/15 Anzac Gallipoli Turkey
At 1945 after a quiet afternoon we put two rounds of rapid fire into the enemy on an agreed signal ? a flare thrown up from our trenches! Had already got into a good elevated position with periscope in order to observe results. Our fire coming in a sudden burst formed a most excellent ruse and drew a great deal of fire. 
Abdul sprang to arms and the hail of bullets they put into us proved their trenches to be fully manned. Probably new troops as all appeared jumpy and although our men only fired two rounds they continued to pump lead into us for quite a considerable time. 
The firing spread right along the line and now at 2106 is still going strong
While out a bomb landed and exploded a few feet from where my seat usually is so absence was providential. Looking in periscope while heavy fire was on, the enemies line vivid with flashes. Our parapets while two rounds being fired one sheet of flame lighting up the soldiers faces In daytime flash not noticeable. All hands enjoy fooling enemy like this and making them think we are coming out If he comes at us so much the better. It is all the boys hope for. At 2230 we are going to give him 3 rounds rapid. Will go up again and
