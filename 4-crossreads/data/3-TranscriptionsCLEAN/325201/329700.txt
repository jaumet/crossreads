  
 last night I was assailed by a Trantula some 4 inches long. They are unpleasant beasts however "da mortuis nil nisi bonum". However he gave me the horrors all right directly after the candle was out. I could see in my fertile brain about five crawling steathily onto me,  &  I would break into a cold sweat  &  light a match. After about an hour  & a box of matches were gone, I arose, took up my bed  &  walked  &  now I live on top of a table in the open.
