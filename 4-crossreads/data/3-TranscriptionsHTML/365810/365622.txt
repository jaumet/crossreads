<p>production in Sydney about five years ago.  Two other good plays now running and which I have seen are "Inside the Lines", a secret service story at Gibraltar, and "Dear Brutus" the new Barrie play which combines the best of Barrie's charm and delicate freshness with an underlying seriousness which leaves a marked impression on one.</p>
<p>I am feeling fairly fit now in spite of the November weather, and am on light duty at a Balloon Depot at Richmond Park.  There, in a camp which is in a fairly advanced state of chaos and is also divided into sections, on the sanctity of which I dare not intrude, I try and find occupation as general superintendent and O.I.C. works and working parties.  As the place is over-run with people for whom soft jobs have been found or made, and with a surplus of trained balloon officers who have nothing to do while waiting to be sent somewhere on duty, you can understand my desire to get back to real work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I hope to hear that you have been doing some touring with Keith and also that he will, when fit again, get a job out there where he will be able to do just as good, if not better, work as over here.</p>
<p>Christmas and New Year greetings (though late) and my affectionate regards to you all.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>L.O'G. Whitfeld</p>
