  
 Friday 11 May 1917 
 Time runs on & we are still facing the Turksbut well entrenched & Barb wire entanglements in front. Our daily bombs are dropped 1st by the Turkson us then our planes visit them & do likewise. Did I tell you of the GAS practice, we have had marching through our own GAS FUMES wearing our Helmets, a suffocating experience at first, & in appearance makes men look hideous. Some day I hope to be rid of it all & back among Rabbits, Fires, Burrs Blowflies & even Strikes. Saw 2 Curlews tonight which made me think of old shooting days  with JOE .
