<p>I drove back to Kandy on my own.   It rained nearly all the afternoon.   Most of our shipmates had left Kandy, Col. Syme, Majors Dunhill &amp; Summons &amp; I were the only officers still at the hotel.  There were also about a dozen nurses &amp; half a dozen of the rank &amp; file.   Late in the afternoon I took a rickshaw to the river &amp; saw four elephants bathing in the muddy water.   Turned in soon after dinner.<br/>Next morning (29th inst.) left Kandy by the 7.15 AM train &amp; reached Colombo about 11.   On the way down it was pretty misty but we occasionally got a glimpse of the magnificent mountain scenery.   Saw plenty of rubber tea &amp; cocoa plantations.   The rice is grown on the mountain sides on a series of terraces.   Arriving at Colombo I made for the telegraph office to see whether there was a cable for me.   They told me that there was not one.  Soon after this I met some one from the ship who told me there was a cable on the ship for me - so I bustled back to the telegraph office &amp; saw the officer in charge.   He looked through the cables recently received &amp; found the one telling me that you were all well &amp; that you were leaving by the Demosthenes on 6th Jany.   Going back to town I made a few purchases at Cargills (two shillings for a writing block) had lunch at the G.O.H.</p>
