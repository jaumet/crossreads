  
 18.9.16 Mon 18th Rose at sunrise this morning & left Bir-El-Abd at 9 oclock & and had a good trip to Romani when opposite Oghratina I was given a message to send per helio to Hatib Gannit , so Jock Elliott, Wride & I fell out, but could not raise them & the Brigade has a good lead on us, so we visited a small Hod on the way home & we had a good feed of ripe dates. we arrived in soon after the Bde, & fixed the 'phone up in the Orderly Room, & found the line down & put in an hour repairing it in the dark. It is said that the Camels were unable to travel to Bir-El-Mazar on account of sore feet & did not turn up
