Wednesday 11 [10] July 1917 [1918]Long busy days full of nursing our boys.  About 60 and generally in a fine mess as a rule.  One prints photos for me, another writes up & papers to help me, and one & all always have a ready smile & word.Every moment is lived when in the wards, & out of them.  Well the Aust. sisters are friendly even if Miss G. is always taking me up wrongly & speaking as though I were a terrible offender.  Very interesting is it to note change of heat - now moist - as the Nile floods, & morning fogs occur.
Capt. Leach gives the pts. Dovers pdr. [powder] grs. x in preference to Asp. [Aspro ?] (which is very expensive).  Most pts. on Mist strych.
Qir. [?] grs. x 1 a.s.Mist - Alba 1 a.s.
[Note in margin] Officers ward.
