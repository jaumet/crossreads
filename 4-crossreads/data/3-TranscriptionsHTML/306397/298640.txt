<p>13/9/14<br/>Between 2 and 3 p.m. a steamer is in sight. We steer for her and she is made to stop. Cargo. gun metal from England to Calcutta. She is a big, new steamer, 4 masts. Sunk between 4 &amp; 5. Her name was "Dopkomat".</p>
<p>Before she was sunk another steamer is in sight. It is the Italian steamer "Loredano." As she carries no contraband she allowed to pass. It was very stormy and only with great difficultness could we board her. After "Loredano" had been allowed to pass all the captured crew from "Dopkomat" is put on board "Kabinga" and let go .</p>
<p>About 6 o'clock we captured the English steamer "Traboth" with coal for Calcutta. The crew was taken on board "Markomania" and then the steamer was sunk.</p>
<p>14/9/14<br/>Nothing unusual.</p>
