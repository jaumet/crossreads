11I thought that perhaps Niven Cuthbert was buried here, & Tom Bochme & I one day searched every cross marked with an October & November date, but it cant be so. One very pretty grave is marked. "Here lie three unknown German soldiers, and the chest & arm of one marked 135 111 R.R. 2nd Komp. R.I.P." The grave is lined with shrapnel shells & has [indecipherable] on the top. We must credit some Tommies with a bit of decent sentiment here.
I have had no chance to get to Warloy. It is 8 miles away. There is a very large grave-yard there, & it is only time to find dear old Alan's grave. I will spare no effort to locate it if the chance ever offers. It is very dreadful about Jack Curtis, Alan Gordon & Wally Hayes isn't it. Ibis, redibis non, morieris in bello.
