Dawn was ushered in by a heavy and continued bombardment in which 3rd Army was rumoured to have hopped over with a result, as we later heard, of 2000 prisoners. Lt. Grieg at our Bde Bomb dump was badly wounded with a piece of shell just above the heart. The weather today was sunny and perfect. The many trees round are showing a blush of green and underfoot is a fine sole of grass. Transport horses from the lines surrounding were scattered all over the hillsides and in the hollows. Going to water they are in long columns and their watering places generally a sea of mud after very little rain. Taubes were over early and archies and emma gees as usual made much noise and little execution. Sausage balloons up all round but are not as venturesome as of old since Fritz has crashed a few for us. In the balloon sections (100 strong) is much waste man power ? soft jobs. At 9.30
