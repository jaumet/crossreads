 till the morrow in the hope of better weather.  That day was another succession of wintry blasts and sleety rain, cold in the extreme.  I do not think I have ever been so cold in my life. 
 Previously I thought that parts of the New England district in N.S.W., and Ballarat in Vic., were cold enough for anything, and represented about the extremes in changes of climate, but Jerusalem, and in general the hill country of Judea, knocks it to use a colloquialism, "into a cocked hat". 
 Wonder of wonders! the 25th dawned fine, though still cold.  Reveille was half an hour earlier to enable leave men to get away by 7.30.  I am included.  There is a tremendous rush, feed up, draw rations for horses and selves, have breakfast and get ready to go on leave, all in about an hour.  I got ready, but went minus my breakfast.  These leave crowds that have gone these last few days must be, I think, the most bedraggled looking pilgrims these old walls have seen for some time.  Boots, leggings, and in many cases clothes caked with mud, we must have made a rough looking crowd.  Anyway here we were. 
 First we were to go through that  interesting  delightful process known as "de-lousing".  The lice here are typhus infected, and as they are abundant, every precaution must be taken.  We marched through endless dirty streets and narrow, stenchful lanes until at last we reached the place.  Here are several big steam disinfectors in use.  Overcoats are done first, then when they come out steaming hot and are dried which takes only a few minutes, you strip to the skin, put your overcoat on and in go the rest of one's things.  While these are "doing" we have a bath in tepid water.  Then our clothes are out, dried in the sun, and in a few more minutes we are on our way to pick up a guide, and see what the Holy City has to offer us.  Of course we can only see a little, and that little we can only glance at.
