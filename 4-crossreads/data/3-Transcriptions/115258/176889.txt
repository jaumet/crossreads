I have just been reading that short old Testament History Mother sent me. BY Jove it seems funny when you come to think of it - In BC1037 David with his army made a big stunt out East of Jordan and captured Amman and here in 1918 AD we are still at the same old game. I dont think the people over here have changed much either</p>
