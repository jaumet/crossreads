<p>June 1917<br/>bad order &amp; could hardly eat anything  Everybody was busy cleaning saddlery, bits &amp; irons today as the G.O.C. Desert Column is inspecting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sunday 10th<br/>The GOC inspected us at 10.30 am  Everybody hates inspections &amp; he was freely cursed everywhere for all the trouble everybody had to go to. However, everything passed off alright.  He said that B Sqdn. horses were the best he had seen &amp; that the men also were looking splendid &amp; fit.  Our bits &amp; stirrup iron got an adverse comment, so I suppose we are in for some hard rubbing in the future.  More beer was issued out, 1 bottle per man.  Was feeling much fitter today.  Heard that the Tommies advanced last night &amp; did good work near Gaza.  Don't know if it is true.  Good news also came from France where the British &amp; French have both advanced.</p>
<p>Monday 11th to 18th<br/>The weather has been getting hotter.  We get an issue of beer now, a little more than a bottle per man per day.<br/>I had my 29th birthday during the week.  It turned out as expected very dull with nothing to celebrate it</p>
