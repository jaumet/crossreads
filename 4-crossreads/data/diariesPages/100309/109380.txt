10/6/17 Paris
A very full day. Up at 9 a.m. and, after a breakfast of coffee and rolls, went out for a walk through the Avenue des Champs Elysees ? delightfully cool and leafy at this early hour. Across the Place de la Concorde and visited the Tuilleries Gardens also in full leaf. The statuary here looks splendid against its background of green. Some of the worlds masterpieces are hereabouts. With characteristic disregard for convention there is here no attempt at the fig leaf. Had a good inspection of the outside of the Louvre and then went up to the Rue de Castiglione for some papers, buying some postcards in the Rued de Rivoli on the way. Then along the Rue de St Honore to the Concorde again and took a taxi back to my hotel ? Elysee Palace. It is a fine hotel and has splendid hall and reception rooms and Gobelin tapestries (just like paintings on many walls. Before the war this was the "plus chic hotel de Paris".
