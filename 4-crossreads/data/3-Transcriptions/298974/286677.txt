<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>It's two dark to see the lines and I am writing in the Salvo Tent with a concert going on behind me. We were greeted by "Marmalade" "Marmalade" "plenty of Marmalade" boys as we came in. This is usual all new comers are "Marmalades" but to-day we were the criers for 230 arrived this afternoon. I have been shoved with the infantry temporarily and have Jim here beside me tonight. It will be some time before I am transferred to the A.M.C. I think I saw a desertion court martial to day and they entend to make an example of the man who is reserved &amp; for sentence &ndash; it may even be death. He deserted and enlisted again.</p>
