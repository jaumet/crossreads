  
 Where is this cheap labour to come from? & how is it to get into  here?  Australia.  We hear of Maltese labour flooding the Country.  Well, far  there were  more Maltese emigrants came to this country in 1912-13 & 14 than since the war.   They are British subjects  They are Europeans no darker of complexion than Italians & members of the British Empire & 400 of them went down in our ships with our men fighting for us in the Jutland Naval Battle.  All who have come into this country receive union rates of wages & are liable to Conscription just the same as our men are.  As for coloured labour - what about our Emigration laws, our education test & our poll tax?  What about our Arbitration courts & the minimum wage?  Are these to fail because we are at war?  They will remain in force till the  white  present inhabitants of Australia repeal them & until this happens we need not fear  the bogy of cheap coloured  labour.  Some say it will destroy unionism, & many a working man selfishly fears to vote yes on that account.  But  is  are not  the essence of unionism  the sayings "Unity is strength"
