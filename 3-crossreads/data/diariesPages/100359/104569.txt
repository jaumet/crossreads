of the notice for the first time said "Hommes, there was heavy fighting there, I read in the "paper" Now it is classed among our Ambs. Jokes.) The S.P. were kept busy squaring up the camps. Capt Irving and party arrived with the horses. We leave after tea and went down town, where the A.S.C. Band was playing. There is a fine old Church in town which I must pay a visit before we leave.
Wednesday 28th
Still raining. Very muddy. Our hut kept dry last night, thanks to our repairs. We had "Sop" for Breakfast, Biscuits soaked in tinned milk and Hot water, which wasn't too bad. For dinner we had tinned meat and vegetables which was very nice and a very pleasant change. This afternoon the crowd went for Route March with packs up. The rain cleared away after dinner and made things quite pleasant. Mac I paid a visit to our friend "Madame" and had some of her very excellent wine.
Thursday June 29th
Small mail arrived. Got letter from Aunt Nell, Mac Wrighty and I had look through Morbeque Church. We climbed right up the rickety old stairs to the clock where we got a good view of the surrounding country. It is a very interesting old church and some of the tombstones date back hundreds of years. In the churchyard is an old headstone with the "Legion of Honor" Order let in. We then went on to Hazelbrouck, a very old town about 4 miles away. There are some fine shops there. The Hall of Justice is a big rambling old building. We went into a Caf and had a feed. Grilled steak and chipped potatoes, for which we paid 1 franc and 3d for a glass of English beer. On our way back we saw a big number of aeroplanes away over. They were evidently Germans, as we could see the shells busting quite distinctly. The rain has cleared away and the weather is just perfect. No one goes to bed early as it does not get dark till about half ? past ten and we cant go to sleep.
