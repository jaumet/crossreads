<p>McDougall being severly wounded in the head</p>
<p>April 11th &ndash; 17<br/>Billy died from wounds last night.</p>
<p>At 6AM this morning we proceeded on our way to take up our new position about a mile past Bapaume</p>
<p>On account of shortage of conveyances, 5 of us came along per boot which we were only too glad of as the cold wind was very severe and the snow falling heavy so we were able to keep ourselves warmer.</p>
<p>It was a weary journey towards the end as the icy winds were against</p>
