<p>14th Got some of our prints last night &amp; they are dead funny talk about laugh, some of the boys nearly split their sides.</p>
<p>A big packet of letters also turned up 15 &amp; a parcel, letters were nearly all dated February &amp; Dec. they have been delayed a long while somewhere.</p>
<p>Have been skating nearly all the afternoon again, got on much better but I done a foolish thing as usual it happened this way, I was sitting on a form at the side of the rink having a breather when I saw a girl coming towards me &amp; just about falling, of course I gallantly flew to her rescue forgetting that I had skates on &amp; was only a beginner just as I reached her we both fell with me of course underneath in a flash there were half a dozen</p>
