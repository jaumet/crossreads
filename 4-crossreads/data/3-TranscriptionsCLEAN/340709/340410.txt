Thursday 31st Dec, 1914 : This is a mighty lonely New Year's eve. I am alone on the GABRIEL except for the native crew. The reason is here. When we arrived at Alexis this morning there was no flag flying at the Naval Depot and no sigh of life was visible. We made fast to the wharf and I was then handed a letter from the P.O. I had left in charge. He stated that acting under orders from Madang he had returned thither with the men. We immediately cast off from the wharf and made for Madang. I went on board the WARREGO which with the YARRA, NUSA, and MATUNGA were in harbour. Here I received instructions that the men of the Naval Guard were to go back to Rabaul with the Infantry in the "Matunga" while I was to remain on board the GABRIEL until the arrival of Major Martin. A volunteer force from Sydney was to take the place of the old garrison, in fact they were already installed. The PARRAMATTA meanwhile has gone north to pick up the garrisons at Eitape and the Sepik. Consequently I am alone on the PINAFORE, which returned to Alexis this afternoon. What sort of a HAPPY NEW YEAR do you call this? For company I have the mail from Sydney which only accentuates the loneliness. O Kaiser Bill, what hev yer dun fer me?In an earlier page of this diary I have quoted the challenges of several sentries. There are one or two more. When we first came to Madang a sentry on duty hearing footsteps close at hand came to the "engage" and shouted. "Halt! Tiger, Tiger, Tiger!" The latter as he recognised the garrison dog.But the following (though it did not occur at this place) is not bad:-A sentry perceiving a small party approaching cried, "Halt! who goes there!""Officer drunk on a barrow," answered one of the party."Pass officer drunk on a barrow, all's well," was the reply.
