<p>3/10/17 Ypres Anzac House<br/>At about half an hour after midnight went up to the front line with Savage Stewart and others and had a windy passage across the valley. At intervals duckboards blown out and huddled forms of dead men sprawled alongside. Reached the rear trench and saw Davis and Kohn and fixed the boundaries on the J.O.T. It was a good light and quite possible to read a map under it. Walked overland to the front line getting some machine gun bullets round us. Found the hedge which is such a feature &amp; so excellent a boundary line. The lake of Zonnebeke showed up clearly in the light. Some flares were fired and the high ruins of an old church looked very beautiful on the other side of the shining water of the lake. But it was no time for admiring the scenery and we pushed over a bit of No Mans Land and found Rodda</p>
