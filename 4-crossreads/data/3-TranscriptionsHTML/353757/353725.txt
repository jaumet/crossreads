<p>No. 12 Off. Mess<br/>Sand Hill Camp<br/>Warminster<br/>21/11/18</p>
<p>Dear Vol</p>
<p>Just a note in pr&eacute;cis;  waiting here for a ship home and expect to be home soon after this letter.  Got my com. after all.  Anxious to get back and also get a job.  What's the prospect of the latter?  Mrs. Hine told me you wrote her, hope you have met her ere now.  Brother George hasn't written lately;  owes me a letter.  Suppose he's too busy marching Rhinewards.  Suppose you'll not come away now;  good job, too.  Stay there if possible.  Influenza still bad here.  Hope it doesn't get too bad in Aussie.</p>
<p>Cheerio, hope to see you ere you have time to acknowledge this letter.</p>
<p>Your cobber<br/>Arthur Hine<br/>2nd Lt.</p>
