 MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; hot, but came up a baby 
 storm at night. Got &nbsp; points. 
 I lopped in 4D, Middle &amp; Mountain 
 paddocks, &amp; then started cutting 
 the cotton bush in Wheelers. 
 Tickle had the poison cart working 
 in Mountain &amp; Boundary. 
 Peter started the 4D sheep at 
 Abbottslea. 
 Harold Barnes came out and 
 took my wool in 35 bales.
