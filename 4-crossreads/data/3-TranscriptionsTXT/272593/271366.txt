was badly needed was the first since Baizeau & our clothes were getting rather soiled as you may guess  we got a sort of a change, they were not too clean but they were better than nothing.When we came out of the line we thought we were going North to Armientieres or Belgium, but it appears that the Australians kicked up a row & refused to go for they reckon that now they have stuck the Somme all through winter & done a lot of fighting they reckon now they have started the Germans going they will stop here & take the good with the bad, for it can't be very much long before Baupaume falls & we want to be in it, & quite right   whats the good of going now
