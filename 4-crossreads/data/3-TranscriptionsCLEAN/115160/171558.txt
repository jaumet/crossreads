 Dear Lock, 
 I've sent you two registered envelopes care of the Crown St Post Office with four sets of cards.  I hope you get them safely.  I think you will be taken on with them.  Today has been mild, but we manage to get our brazier going all the same. 
 There's nothing to mention, I hope you are well and having plenty of business. 
 Fondest regards, 
 Your loving Cousin, 
 Jim Drummond
