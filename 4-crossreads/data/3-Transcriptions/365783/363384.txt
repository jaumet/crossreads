<p>I thought the last word might cheer you up a bit &ndash; a little bit of the old lamb.   I hope you got this cable all right.   To-day I received your cable "May I come leaving children Trixy Norrises Westbourne Grove Post Office"   To this I replied at once addressed to Read Westbourne Grove Post Office London "No leaving shortly".<br/>I guessed that this last cable of yours followed on the receipt of my letter written from the Continental Hotel Cairo.   Well I would have been delighted to have got you across, but I fear that by the time you got here the bird would have flown   I being the bird.   We are leaving very shortly I cannot say when or for where but will take the earliest opportunity of advising you as to our whereabouts.   I have been keeping real well since my three days spell in Cairo &amp; am now feeling just the thing.   There is only one thing I want &amp; want badly &amp; that is a sight of my loved ones.   Fred had had a bit of a throat but I don't think it has been very bad &ndash; he has had such a lot of illnesses you know.   A good number of the men have been sick one way &amp; another &ndash; it is not too healthy a spot where we are camped &ndash; shortly before we got here</p>
