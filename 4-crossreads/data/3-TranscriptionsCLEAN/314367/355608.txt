Shortly after the Commander got very bad & then we found the Chief Engineer was down & the Pay was bad too - This of course meant a common cause - food poisoning - We had all had tinned herring - luckily only a small bit each - for breakfast - The C & I were the worst & when the Navigg. Lieutenant fell down on the deck I couldn't move - However I told my SBA what to do & about 3.30 I was sufficiently well not to vomit & got up & went the rounds & took charge & then went to bed again - The C. was passing out pure blood so that'll show you it wasn't too good -Luckily I was prepared for sickness - my cots were handy & my stretchers & I got the sick taken on to the poop deck & the Bosun (Mr Bumpus) took the Fantome up St Georges Channel & past Herbertshohe & there we anchored - Luckily the storm was over & on Thursday we were on our legs again but neither the C nor I cd. go ashore - That's the danger of tinned food - 5 officers out of 9 put clean out of action -
