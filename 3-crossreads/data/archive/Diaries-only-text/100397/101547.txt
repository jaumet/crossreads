Dear Mother
This morning the mail brought along a letter from Overstrand, with John's Letter enclosed, I will write J. as soon as possible, though news is very scarce, your letter dated 16.7.17. came along yesterday also one from Min, and, a short note from Simmons who is away in Blighty at one of the camps. I expect that he will be returning shortly but do not know for certain, I hope that you have received more of my Letters, there must be some of them astray, Harrys too, do not seem to reach their destination, I suppose that it cant be helped. Nothing fresh has eventuated since I wrote last week. the weather still holds good, and the days are quite warm and pleasant, I hope they keep good, for awhile Jack Howell was. well, when. I heard from him not long ago, I have not been able to see him yet, and have no idea when I will get an opportunity to hunt him up. The people here are busy, hoppicking, at this farm. there are about 28 pickers,
