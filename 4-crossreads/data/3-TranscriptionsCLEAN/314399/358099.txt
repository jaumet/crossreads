Had dinner with the Y, M people & then to the opera. Saw Hamlet & it was excellent. Did me.  Apres the show went for a stroll & then back for supper & bed. 
 Sunday 13 April 1919 Rained all day but cleared for an hour or two in the afternoon. Went thro. a market where they sold everything. Snails, frogs & all that sort of thing. Then went to Sacre Couer & enjoyed it immensely. Had lunch at a small cafe (for a huge price). Afterwards went on a YM Trip on the river. First to the Marne & then to St Cloud. Gee it is some trip. Enjoyed it immensely. The view from St Cloud is beautiful. Got out at St Cloud & had our photos taken & also some tea. Went to the Follies Bergere & the show was good. Plenty of  legs of course. Went for a stroll after & then home to bed.
