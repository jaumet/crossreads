<p>20/4/18 &ndash; Lavieville<br/>Dooley and others came up tonight and sent other officers out in their place.  It was a quiet evening and there was nothing doing until our guns heavily opened up on a strafe about dusk.  The General &amp; I were recalling old battles this morning in connection with the Flers battle.  Plenty of papers &amp;c came up tonight.  Put 3 companies on the job digging tonight and some more people on wiring.  The battle will begin here again soon and it simply boils down to who can shift his divisions the quickest.  I back the Germans for transport every time.</p>
