<p>[Transcriber's note:<br/>This diary covers the period from 24 November to 12 December 1916. A large part of it concerns James Marshall's four-day leave in London, 24-27 November. He describes the places he visited and compares the sights of London to those in Sydney, his home town, voting Sydney the more attractive and interesting architecturally.<br/>He also describes a visit to a Mr and Mrs Butcher of Woolwich, parents of a young man he had known at Graythwaite, the ANZAC hostel and convalescent home in North Sydney, who, he learned, had recently died of spinal meningitis.<br/>Pages 29-39 give details of life back in camp on Salisbury Plain near Wilton as his unit underwent bayonet and grenade training for the front.]</p>
