<p>3rd August Thursday Romani</p>
<p>As it happened last night someone at the head of the column took us direct home without a hitch when we got back. This morning two German Taube's  came over and attacked one of our small Bristol Scout Aeroplanes This machine is exceptionally swift being capable of doing 120 miles per hour the same pace as a Taube They got into holds but the Engine of the Bristol Scout suddenly Stopped And he volplaned [glided &ndash; Transcriber] down gracefully to earth. The engine probably was hit however the Taube's made off. Later on some of our machines bombed Qatia which has been occupied by the Turks since last night (The bombard was terrific 6 &amp; 7 at a time were the order and the bombing was kept up for about</p>
