<p>Gallipoli 13/10/15</p>
<p>[indecipherable] in way</p>
<p>It was kind of you to write to me and I can see you have all been having a very [indecipherable] time. I hardly know how to start to tell you the news here as I feel I shall probably be recapitulating what you already know &ndash; we reached here nearly 26 weeks ago &amp; the 15th has been continually in the Trenches without a break of a day since &ndash; Some of the 15th are away resting &amp; in hope for a breather in another month or so &ndash; or else there will be none left. I enclose you a slate showing our position &ndash; The wounded however are about double the number, and the rest have returned to duty and are I know present &ndash; of the 90 officers who were here there are but 3 original ones left &ndash; Two W.A. (10th) and myself except one doctor &ndash; The 8th have only one officer left, Higgins, the 9th none. &ndash; None of the 15th staff left &ndash; My Brigadier went away very sick a month ago &amp; I fear it is enteric, as the last accounts of him are not good &ndash; I have been appointed in his place with rank of Colonel &ndash; MacFarlane is in Australia wounded &ndash; and my 15th Major came over in the 1st A. Div. as a <u>private</u></p>
