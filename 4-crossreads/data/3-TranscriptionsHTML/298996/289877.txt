<p>rough side, which is a change from what we have had this last week or so. Pay to day <strike>On</strike></p>
<p>Saturday 11.4.15<br/>Nice &amp; fresh this morning, sea still in a bad mood. Hot again to day. I saw some Dolphins to day jumping quite upright out of the water to catch <strike>some</strike> flying fish from all appearances. Later just on dusk I saw a Whale which was giving us a fine display such as poulting water as it went along.</p>
<p>Sunday 12-4.15<br/>I woke up this morning with a beautiful sweat up. We arrived at Aden at 9.PM. we were under way again at 1.AM. which meant we did not see Aden</p>
