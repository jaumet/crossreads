7th. Been a very quiet & tiresome day  how the time drags & I suppose the nearer we approach "Aussie" the slower the time will go, I am just beginning to realize that at last I am going home, & I wonder & ponder how everyone will seem to me] after being away so long  they are certain to see a vast change one way or the other for it will be just on 7 years since I left Tassy with the intention of stopping 18 months in N.S.W. but as the old saying goes "man proposes but God disposes", & this is what my few months have led too, & during that period a chap must alter considerably
