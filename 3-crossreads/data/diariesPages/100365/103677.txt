A hard days work with nothing of any importance occurring. Was out near Senlis" there does not seem to be anything left of the nice beautiful little Town. Big buildings churches are now nothing but a heap of ruins.On the sides of the Main Road caves are built deep down when the enemy prepare to use Gas warning is sent back from the trenches the villagers don their Helmets make for these caves which are prepared for them.The fierce attack counter attack still continues from eye witnesses the same story is told viz, that the Germans are getting Hell all along the British Front.The 1st Division are not out of the Firing Line for a spell, another Division having taken their place are moving into this District for a well earned rest. They have done well were complimented by General Sir Douglas Haig. Pay Day this Evening but I am not going to draw.
