<p>The photo was sent me by a chap in hospital and was found on a German and is supposed to be of Armenians being hung by Turkish officers. It is not a nice photo and I&#39;m not sending it home for my collection. I went over yesterday afternoon and saw Jim Leask; I was at Fort St with him you know, we went to that Rural&nbsp;camp together and he was a signaller in this regt till he got his com in the 11th. I reckon he was one of the finest soldiers and straightest man I know. he was badly wounded the other day and cut off by the turks, and it is a marvel how he got in and lived but he looks wonderfully well on it now and hopes to go home to Australia. His people live in Mosman and I think Aunt Min knows them. His only other brother was killed in France. Dont think there is any more news now Father, I will try and write again in a day or two when Mother&#39;s parcel comes, or if my photos are ready to send. It must be great for the Jelarah people having Geoff home again. Hope Hal likes the Uni?&nbsp;Wonder if they have him on cutting up frogs yet? Love to Mother &amp; Hal and Fred. I am your loving son Robert C Wilson</p>
<p>P.S. Re the enclosed photo Please dont let it be put in the paper, as the negative belongs to some other chap and I was just given a print so the photo is not really mine.</p>
