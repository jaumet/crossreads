<p>Moved up to ground lying between Strazeele &amp; Meteren &amp; dug in a position. Enemy advance is supposed to have reached Merris. Bn Hqrs at brewery cellars in Strazeele &amp; B coy are there in reserve.<br/>D  Coy Hqrs in small farmhouse on the Meteren road.</p>
<p>Sat 13th April:-<br/>Day passed quietly &amp; our own patrols pushed forward to Merris.</p>
<p>Sun Ap 14th:-<br/>Shifted D Coy Hqrs from farmhouse to ploughed field in front. Some enemy attacks knocked back. I suppose they</p>
<p>Were just "feelers" by his advance.</p>
<p>Mon Apr 15th:-<br/>Fritz has been shelling Strazeele &amp; farmhouses on road severely but he will have little hope digging out Bn Hqrs from the cellars of the  Brasserie St Pierre though he caught some of B Coy who were in some of upper rooms.</p>
<p>Tues Apr 16th:-<br/>C Coy hopped over towards MerriS. Left flank reaches objective but the right got held up by machine-gun fire.</p>
<p>Wed Apr 17th:-<br/>D Coy moved around</p>
