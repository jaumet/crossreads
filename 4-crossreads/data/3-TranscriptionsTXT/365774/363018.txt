 This letter from Kasr-el-amy H. 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Batt. C Coy 25.6.15 My Dear Mother The usual weekly letter to let you know I am getting on well. My leg is nearly alright now. I can get along OK on crutches expect to be able to walk with the aid of a stick in a weeks time. As you will see by the heading on top the good old Y.M.C.A. are again on the scene. They have built a big straw matting hut with 4 long tables with writing material &amp; a piano for the convenience of the wounded "twaddies" they deserve a lot more credit &amp; mention from the Aust Daily papers etc. than they do. I really dont know what we would do if they were not so considerate it is much easier to write on a table than on your knee. If it wasn't for the said tables a lot of letters would be postponed indefinitely. The only mail I have received for 3 months I had yesterday 2 from Lizzie &amp; 2 from Ulmarra dated in March. I am anxiously waiting for a big bundle which will turn up some of these days. Well mother dear I will close now with fondest love from your loving son Ken
