  
 here.   It was rather interesting.   The village consists mostly of very old Square stone buildings, there being no method in the laying out of the streets or lanes.   The streets or lanes are narrow & very rough & rocky & running & all directions.   Where ever we appeared the women young & old & boys & girls would at once disappear into the homes shutting the doors & even the shutters on the windows.   I questioned one of the men who could speak English & he said that they were afraid of all soldiers as those they were used to seeing in the past had treated them very badly.   The predominant flower grown on the Island appear to be the "stock" which blooms beautifully.  I noticed on looking into one of the cemeterys that it is the custom to have the graves convex instead of heaping the earth as we do, & at the head of each grave is placed a lantern.
