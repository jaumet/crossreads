[January 1917]
(22) Great outburst of Big-gun fireing on our right towards "Les-Boeufs" lasted for about an hour. Fritz indulges in a little Artillery work to night, several dug-outs in B. Coys trench knocked to atoms, but luckily no one were in them at the time.
(23) A very heavy frost fell last night. and made it easily the coldest day we have experienced up till the present. Aeroplanes were very active on both sides to day. Usual Big-Gun straffing again this evening. Pte Crittenden killed by shell explosion to night.
(24) A "snodger" cold morning. 45th Bn left Switch Gap trench this morning arrived at "Mametz Wood" at midday were we billeted in Huts. On our way down from the trenches we passed by the old 13th Bn going in, met several of my old comrades.
(25) Allmost to cold to sleep to night. Water in tanks frozen hard, very amusing to see the boys with axes picks chopping it out to fill their Tea Dixies. Majority of he Boys have only one blanket and feel the cold very much.
(26) Another "frezzer" this morning Aeroplanes very Active to day.
