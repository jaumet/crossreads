<p>About half past five we heard a hell of a hullabaloo and were informed that it was the first brigade making an attack on <strike>the</strike> Johnny Turk at a place called Lone Pine so called because a solitary pine tree <strike>marke</strike> originally marked the spot. Since then the gunners of the artillery made short work of it.<br/>The sun went down on the blue waters of the Aegean Sea with only three solitary destroyers and I think one hospital ship in sight. Just in the distance could be seen the Isle of Imbros in a sort of a fog. Its a funny thing but I cant recollect ever seeing that island in anything else but a haze. There is another island close to Imbros which I don't know the name of but which was in the same foggy condition.<br/>At about eight o'clock we got our water bottles filled and also our issue of rum, for which we were devoutly thankful. Some time after eight o'clock</p>
