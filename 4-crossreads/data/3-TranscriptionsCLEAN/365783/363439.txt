Mena13.4.15.Dearest old Mrs,Your letter of 1.4.15. arrived yesterday - glad to hear you received stockings etc all right.I was in Town yesterday & on my return found your cable on my pillow "Overland almost impossible prefer Bibby liner Warwickshire leaving Liverpool April twenty ninth to other lines cable yes or no"   This morning I sent you cable "People here say no difficulty crossing France enquire fully & decide yourself welcome"   While in Town yesterday & before getting your cable I made enquiries at various shipping offices & from some people at the Continental who had heard of others who had recently come across France I judged from these enquiries that there would probably be no difficulty in getting across France & for the reasons stated in my last letter I regard this as quite safe.    I presume from your cable that you made enquiries & that you considered that the overland route was almost impossible & that the trip by the Warwickshire would be quite safe.   My further cable of to-day was just to show you what I had learnt & to emphasize that I would much prefer you to come across France.
