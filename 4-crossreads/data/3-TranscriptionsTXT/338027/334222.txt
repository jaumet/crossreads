 Sunday, 8 August, 1915 It is a hard thing to write these lines as I would like to blur from my memory the thoughts of this awful day.  Our brave lads achieved their effort &amp; captured Hill 971 but lost it again, the casualties on both sides were enormous.  We were evacuating the sap and along this all the mules, ammunition &amp; reinforcements had to come up and the Turks knew this and poured shrapnel into it all day, it was Hell, they shelled the beach with the wounded lying helpless on they could not be taken to the ships we had to go backwards &amp; forwards all day &amp; night with our stretchers, stepping over dead, &amp; being bumped by the mules, how we escaped was miraculous bullets went through our clothing but it got four of our best men two killed and two wounded, our patients in some cases were killed on the stretchers, dead were falling all around us but we continued. 
 Monday, 9 August, 1915 Owing to the congestion in the sap we were enabled to get [indecipherable] of hours sleep last night, but at the patients cost, we could not get them away, and it was awful to see them suffering, they were lying out in the sap with the sun beating pitilessly down on them we did everything we could for them, made tea &amp; bovril etc but the suffering cannot be described here in words.  On the beach it was worse, the hospital ships are full &amp; they cannot get them away and their they lie, many are killed on their stretchers the smell from the dead reeks the beach is frightful, they are burying as fast as they can, the [indecipherable]N.Z. was killed by a stray bullet.  When we did get a move on the R.A.M.C. could not get them away, some of these corps are badly managed.  Our lads are just holding the hill but against enormous odds the N.Z.F.A. guns have been brought up along with us.
