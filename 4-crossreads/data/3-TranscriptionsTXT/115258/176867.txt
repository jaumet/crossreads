or two and see if I can borrow his. A Mudgee Guardian came along by the mail, with out an address on it so I copped out on it. I notice that in the Ulan news there is no mention made now of the rifle club. Has it gone bung? Or are all the chaps surposed to be trained enough to defend their country if need be! I'm afraid some of them would require a lot of training though. By Jove Fred there is no doubt a little infantry work is a great rest to an L.H. man. Its a regular holiday here not having to keep turning out to water and stables three times a day. The only thing you notice is the shortage of water here, with the horses you can always get as much as you want to wash in but here where the water has to all come up on camels at night you get tons to drink but have to be content with about a bottle full to wash in now and again. However that is not great heardship up here. I'm writing this sitting up on a hill in the foothills and over looking the Jordan Valley. its a plain of about ten miles wide with a lot of broken country in the middle where the Jordan runs through it. It is looking pretty droughty now but there is a lot of dry feed on it (which catches fire when ever they stick any shells into it) and I often picture out a lot of little paddocks on it running down to the Jordan, and stud sheep in the them and I'd build a house on this hill, where I could keep an eye on them - but I'm afraid they would not do well in this climate and I'm sure I would not like to live here for long - but it is a great place for a stud farms, if the country was decent.
