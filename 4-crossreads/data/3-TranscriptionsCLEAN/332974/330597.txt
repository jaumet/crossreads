  
 To the Consul General of U.S.A Melbourne 
 Sir, 
 The former internees of Torrens Island now interned in Liverpool, N.S.W. have resolved unanimously not to give further Evidence, for the following reasones. Several complaints   of wish  made by us, have been refused to be enquired into, also it seems to us in a body, that this enquiry is of a hurrying nature, as several very important Witnesses do not get called to give evidence so, as to procure a fair hearing, and a just trial.  It is also our wishe to be represented in the Curt Sitting by at least two of our Comrades, owing our present representative has not been choosen, or selected.  We wishe you to cable such to the foreign Ambassador of U.S.A.
