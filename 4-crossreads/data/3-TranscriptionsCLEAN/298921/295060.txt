March, 1915Sunday 28Posted diary yesterday will be glad to hear if you receive these notes. Am trying to get leave to go to "Luxoor" to see Temples etc & Karnuak - said to be the oldest buildings in the world & temples of rameses & duron etc; with [indecipherable] of Sphinxes etc 4000 B.C. Terrific Duststorm today & the camp obliterated in the desert sand with millions of Locusts darkening the sky, quite droughty weather but it never rains in Egypt.Saw Miss Alice McCulloch (Colin's daughter) & Audrey Chirnside at the Continental Balls, but of course they did not know me. Sheila Chisholm also there.
