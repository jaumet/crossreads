<p>I don't know whether you realise the difficulty of writing up each day.  Some days Fountain Pen won't work then I use Pencil &amp; hope you can read &amp; after all it is a pleasure to let you know my daily life &amp; its little enough .<br/> [Following paragraph is crossed out]<br/>Thank Joe for sending [indecipherable] I am nearly alright again.  The Plaster I must have mislaid never mind<br/>I don't think you need worry about the Turks beating us on the Canal it is nearly as tough a proposition as our try at the Dardanelles.<br/><strike>Joe mentions Cornolla sold but he does not say who to?</strike></p>
