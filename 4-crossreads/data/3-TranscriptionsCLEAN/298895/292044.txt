  
 April 10th Tuesday 1917 I start this new diary the 4th since enlistment under conditions perhaps brighter & more promising than any we have had since the commencement.  We are in the midst of a big advance & an offensive started north of Arras has been at once successful, on all sides we stand to win.  Americas moves also will assist, the whole world now being frantically arrayed against a common enemy.  How long it will take Germany to admit defeat is now the only question   I trust it will be soon.  Had a kit inspection today which interfered with our routine making a very heavy afternoon, however all finished well.  Weather most changeable snow one minute then bright sunshine still very cold.  Our present location a chateau, I learnt today belongs to Baron Rothschild, it has certainly been a very fine place.
