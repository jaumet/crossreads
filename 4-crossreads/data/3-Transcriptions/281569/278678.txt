<p>28 May, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>Reveille as usual</p>
<p>Had an exceptionally heavy night last night &amp; only had one operator to get over the work we handled over 300 mss in the first 12 hours.</p>
<p>A detachment of the Squadron came in during the afternoon including all the outcasts of the troop they are here for the stunt that is coming off tomorrow night &amp; at the same time are installing a Divn Signal Office so will relieve us of a lot of traffic.</p>
<p>Out of touch with the outposts at 1700 &amp; was out till after 10 climbing round hills gullys cliffs etc &amp; at times out in front of the cossac posts. DRs doing trips up to 7 miles &amp; taking 5 hours to do it &amp; in heavy sand, the New Zealanders are doing it day about with us.</p>
<p>Bed midnight.</p>
<p>29 May, 1916 Monday</p>
<p>85 Wks from home</p>
<p>Reveille at 5</p>
<p>Heaps of work today in preparation for tomorrow when great things are expected, we got all equipment together &amp; in good order. The aeroplanes reports were favorable for no activity of unusual occurrence was noticed amongst his troops.<br/>Mail is expected although I don't suppose anything will come to light for me.</p>
<p>Downing is treating me like a trump, he has given me an officers saddle (having no further use for it) &amp; in many other ways he is extending the glad hand. Hal &amp; his section have got the Sig office fixed up &amp; now our traffic should be much lighter, we did 323 today which is a record for any Signal Troop &amp; compliments are flying galore.</p>
