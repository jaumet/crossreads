<p>Bulford<br/>Dear Mum<br/>This is the street that I have to walk through on entering the Village from Bulford. The House that is marked is on the corner of Salisbury Street which runs away to the left. At the bottom of High Street stands the old church  &amp;  the river runs across, the Bridge View I have sent to Dad. I have not yet been to a Service in the church. I may go on Sunday night. I am going to Salisbury to-morrow. If it is a fine day I will go for a row on the River or creek as our Boys call it. It is never more than about 50 yards wide, but it is beautiful scenery all the way   &amp;  the boats are as light as a feather with outrigger fittings as well. Mum, I have no news except that we are both well   &amp;  having as good time as we can. I am a bit short of money but Mr Charlie Jones said I can  borrow from the Firm if I like so I will do so  &amp;  be under no obligation to anyone,  &amp;  it is always to be had at a Moment's notice. Love to all our Neighbours   &amp;  Friends   &amp;  to you at Home.  Harry</p>
