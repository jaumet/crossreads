6/2/17 Amiens to Rouen
While debating what to do the waiter put a bill of a play on the table and I walked round to Georges Hall Rue des Carmines a barn of a place with tawdry scenery. Paid 5 fr. for a "box", a little fenced off cretonne place. Quaint notice up beside stage "Please Boys! Don't send anything on the stage it could be very dangerous". The show was varied dancing singing c mostly in French but they sang some English songs. About 9 oc a fair audience was in the house. The average officer on Base job is not a very intellectual person. Some of them were exuding whisky at every pore and weak faced looking derelicts. Joy girls came in and sat in the audience and joined one on a nod and payment of the extra prix to the ticket collector. As one gentleman of the very gallantly put it "handling them helps to pass the time". The dances on the stage were quite respectable but rather more lingerie is shown than would be considered proper at home. Mostly small white frilled knickers were worn
