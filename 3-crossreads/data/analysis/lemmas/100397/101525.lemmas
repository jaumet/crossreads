My Dear Mother I am onc more away from the line , this time I stop a small piec of shell with my leg . whether they will send me over to Blighti I cannot say but it is high probabl that I will have to remain this side of the channel this time , still I am hope that they send me across for I want to go and have anoth holiday in Surrey . I have receiv sever letter from Mrs Horton , and , in the last she told me that your letter for me had arriv . I have not receiv them yet , but they will come along safe some time , I also had a letter from Harri he was still at the School and seem to be have a fair good time , was not certain how much longer he would be there , but thought that he might be sent across to join his Unit . Your letter tell me about willi , was the last that I receiv I did not have an opportun to find out anyth at all , as we were veri busi . We have been ever sinc Easter Monday , that was the day they pick for us to start , and then we had to keep at it . On Easter Monday we had The Wurlimburg to hunt out of a villag but last opon were the Prussian Guard , it was all bomb fight and they fought well , they did not like leav their trench , at all , but we want it so they had to . after we had taken a part of it we were reliev and went back a coupl of mile to have a rest We were onli back a few hour then had to go up to anoth part to reliev one of our Battn , I was there about 10 hour befor I got "hit " but did not stop 10 minut after . I left quick as fritz was just open up with his Artilleri . I had a live trip down from the line , but got through safe and here I am I was not quit so unlucki this time as last . Our R.Q.M. had his head quarter not veri far from the Casualti Clear Station so I walk across and saw him and got Permiss to get anyth that I want out of my pack . So I secur my razor and a coupl of other small articl which I wish to save .
