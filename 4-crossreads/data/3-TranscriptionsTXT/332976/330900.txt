 July 1917 22nd   I have got my teeth fixed up but only temporily, &amp; returned to Corbie by train this afternoon.   A concert was held in the hospital last night &amp; it was a great success.   The concert party  was  made up from the 8th Field Amb. are known as the "Night Birds." The whole company were out on a route march this morning &amp; returned about 1.30 P.M. but I missed it, fortunately. 23rd   Nos. 1 &amp; 4 sections were out drilling this morning near the canal, &amp; this afternoon we went down to the wharf &amp; cleared up all stores &amp; material &amp; took it up stream about a mile &amp; stacked it at the Lock.
