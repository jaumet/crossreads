<p>&amp; Tasmanian troops disembarked.  There were 229 of the former &amp; 67 of the latter.</p>
<p>The troopship soon filled up again, as Queensland &amp; N.S.W. men off the "Boonah" came on board. Leave was granted for the remainder of the troops on board, from 2 oclock to mid-night. Naturally I was delighted, and immediately went ashore. The crowd outside the wharf was immense, &amp; scores of cars were in the vicinity, all gaily decked with flags.  I boarded a train &amp; very shortly found my-self in the heart of the city.  Melbourne is a fine old place, &amp; naturally my thoughts "flew" back to the time when the 8th Field Ambulance was camped there. The old fashioned cable tram took me to the Cliffedon Mansions, where I found Vera Ramaciotti on the look out for me from the balcony. Words cannot describe, the joy of our meeting, we were both too excited to speak.  I stoped with Clive &amp; Vera till 8 oclock, and I was sorry to leave them so soon;  but I had other friends to see. The Neustadt "folk" were greatly surprised when I called at their home at 9 oclock at night. I received a great welcome there, &amp; I was conveyed back to the boat at mid-night by car.  It was hard to realize that it was close on 4 years since I saw them last. I enjoyed my few hours leave immensely, and the next day when a start is made for my Home town, I could scarcely control my-self.   Only 577 miles to go &amp; then "Home sweet Home".</p>
