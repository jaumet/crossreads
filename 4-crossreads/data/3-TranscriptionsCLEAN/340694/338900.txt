 9 p.m. Thin brown lines have been passing by since tea time. The lads look in splendid nick, & as brown as the clothes they're in. Each Battalion has its' band & everyone seems very cheerful. It's the thought of leaving this country I think. The Tommies are arriving to take over I don't envy them a bit this is not a white man's land. We are kept at it supplying transport as there's only two Coys here to do it. 
 1/6/16. The 12th Brigade marched out to-day & looked very fit. Our Coy shifted the whole Brigade in record time.
