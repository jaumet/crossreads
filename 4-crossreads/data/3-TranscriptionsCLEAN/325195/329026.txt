4.12.15Sat 4thLast night Francis & I went down to the beach & brought back a piece of hardwood that had been washed ashore, it was as much as we could carry & will keep us in firewood for a week or two; a Turkish spy dressed as an Indian & went from camp to camp haircutting for some months past was arrested & found guilty and shot a few days ago; This afternoon 7 warboats opened up to the south of us & it was the heaviest bombardment I have yet heard, the seven boats firing broadsides making one continuous roar while the bombardment lasted; some gun off the warboats which were landed & are now dug in along the beach blew the top off Snipers Nest this afternoon; The 17th Seige Battery done the job, otherwise all quiet & warm
