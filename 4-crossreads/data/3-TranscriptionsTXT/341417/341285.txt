 We had our 1st fall of snow this year on 26th Inst. and the ground is still white. At present chilblains is the fashionable complaint. Tates Whiskey is the remedy used By some, it would appear that they suffered with this trouble on their tongue &amp; are most exact, in the treatment. I got a bit of a shake up to-day. Was in a motor smash. The driver got a nasty gash on his head &amp; I got a fright. About a month ago, I had to return thanks to my lucky star also. A gun burst &amp; put 2 of my friends in hospital. Well, Dear Mrs Dunlop, I'll close this hasty note by bidding you all at "Evenslode", my Best Wishes. 
 Yours Faithfully Clem Walsh
