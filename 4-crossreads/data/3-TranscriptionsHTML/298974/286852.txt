<p>6<br/>The news about Hazel is fine. Olly heard first from Ran. What on earth becomes of the poor lads mail I don't know, he has no luck at all. He was awfully worried, but, I dined with him on the eve he got the telegram, &pound; he was up in the skies. He's awfully amused at the sweet infant being ginger. I'll bet he calls him "ginger mick". I think it was lovely of Hazel to dub him Alan, I guessed the dear kid would. My mail is arriving regularly, do write often, I want to hear everything. I met Noel Cuthbert too. He looks very well, we had an evening together too, and I met a pal of his Lieut Neuth, whose sister lives with the Waughs. Isn't it a small world?</p>
<p>Well, mother dear, as usual, I'm writing against time. They keep us very busy, &pound; I've been looking up pals instead of writing since we have been out. Give my best love to all</p>
<p>Your loving son Dene<br/>(D.B. Fry)</p>
