<p>our march, but a good tea was soon ready for us &amp; we were in bed in an hour or so.</p>
<p>This camp is a big one, and is very compact. We are all under canvas to the extent of 16 per tent &amp; find this sort of home fairly comfortable although all our feet are in a heap at night just like a bunch of turnips, or something like that.</p>
<p>April 27</p>
<p>We pararded for our service rifles and bayonets this morning and were then inspected by the Camp Officers. We also got an issue of two helmets, one for gas-attacks, the other as a precaution against shrapnel. This latter is made of steel &amp; is worn here on all parades &amp; at all times in the firing-line.</p>
<p>A dental &amp; medical parade occupied the rest of the time.</p>
<p>The training as a rule covers a period of ten working days and is styled "intensive" and is to a large extent recapitulatory.</p>
