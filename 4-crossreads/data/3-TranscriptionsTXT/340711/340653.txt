about 4 pm. Legs heavy as lead. Had another seizure---nearly choked. Went over to see doctor---he was not in. News through Roumania declared war. Bulgaria thrown up sponge. Fellows very excited. One could hear cheers coming from all round as each unit learned the news. Rumours prevalent of great naval battle---43 German vessels, 16 British and 7 French, sunk.
