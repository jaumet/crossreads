<p>17.12.15<br/>the machine gun on Russell's Tops have also received orders to hold the Turks back as long as possible &amp; they are also to be left behind if we have any difficulty in getting away; The Gurkhas are leaving tonight; this evening the Colonel &amp; Adj  &amp;  Major Granville went around to Bde Head  Quarters to see the Head about the final arrangements. Another gun of D Bty was sent away today &amp; now only one remains. Somehow I fancy we shall all get away off the Peninsula without being molested by the Turks; We ran another 'phone line out today down to the Gully to A Sqd. No 1 Sub Section &amp; believe we are to get a 'phone from Bde tomorrow &amp; have another Station working tomorrow night   Last night we could hear the lads going out to the transports  singing Good-by Gallipoli we could hear them quite plain &amp; thought it hardly fair to us, as the it was as good as telling the Turks they were leaving</p>
