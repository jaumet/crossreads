31st.  Our new Coy. Commander is trying to put his foot down & bring the troops to a bit of order or so he thinks he is by the way he spoke on parade this morning, first of all he towelled all those up who were not wearing their Army overcoats then down on the No chin strap brigade.  He reckons he is going to have an alteration within a very short time.  I don't like his chance if he thinks he is going to start red tape methods for everyone is so discontented with hanging about here & they won't stand any domineering methods.Got a batch of letters form "Aussie" this morning & one of them upset me a little or I should say a fair bit.  It was one from Dick Duke in answer to a letter I had written while in Birmingham, I was never so sorry over a thing before & I used to wish that the boat that was carrying that letter would meet with an accident but no such luck she got it alright & as I thought it cut her up considerably
