Sunday 29th
It was about the most uncomfortable night I ever spent, and was very glad when daylight came. Then I got up and lit a fire and with the assistance of Roy Knowles made some tea, which put a bit of life into us. It rained very heavily and a bitterly cold wind was blowing. Fritz put over plenty of shrapnel, but our party were very lucky as usual. Every day a number of our chaps have to return to H.Q. with shell shock or other sickness. The strain on a man's nerves is awful, and how the deuce our squad is sticking it I don't know. It was very nice to sit by a bit of fire. Rations were very scanty and to improve matters the "Big game" is giving us a lot of trouble. We made a stew with Bully Beef Biscuits, which with cocoa made a very good dinner. The fire took a lot of coaseing to make it burn, as the wood was very wet. We knocked a number of Amm. Cases to pieces for firewood. A No. of Infantry called in on their way from the front line and gratly enjoyed the cocoa we had. The 14th relieved us about 4 p.m. which gave us time to get back to Green Dump in daylight. My heels were very sore and I dropped behind the crowd and after walking for about 2 hours I got "bushed" and struck some mud up to my hips. Luckily Frank Corrigan and a No. of others came along, and we assisted each other along. Fritz put a couple of Whizz-bangs" over very close to us and splashed us with mud. When we reached Camp we were issued with dry socks and a lot of rum, both of which were badly needed. Then I got a copy of tea and some stew and we to our dug-out where Jack Keen had a good fire burning. It seemed like Heaven to take off our sopping wet clothes and turn into our blankets 48 hours is a long time to be out without sleep especially when rations are short. On our way Home we passed 2 horses that had got bogged in the mud and been shot. It is far beyond me to attempt to describe things, but it almost seems like a ghastly nightmare.
