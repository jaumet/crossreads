keep the water off this book, oh I can tell you I am writing under difficulties.
Last night the 3rd Batt.s band was playing they had a great fire going
Nothing but fatigues this morning, drawing ammunition, steel helmets, gas helmets, rations, various other things.
I have seen quite a number of the 53rd round here including a few of the old hands who joined it when the Batts were broken up at "Tel-el-Kebir," nearly the whole of the Australian Force is here there is going to be something doing next time we hop over. Saw no less than 46 aeroplanes up Although we are but 5  miles from the firing line, the place at night time looks more like some big town with its thousands of lights fires, it beats me as how the Germans don't shell the place to pieces for there is nothing to stop them
