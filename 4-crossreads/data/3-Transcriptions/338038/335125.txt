<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother<br/>Have run myself rather close up to mail closing time again, but in any case there is no authentic news available since last week.<br/>My man (Gandy) returned from Lemnos a day or two ago having been away ill for the last 6 weeks, so that I am living in something like comfort again, bath every morning etc. what?<br/>Richards still away so I am afraid he must be fairly bad. Saw D.J. Toomey yesterday. He is still OK.<br/>Weather has been perfect the last few days, but we are all dreading the idea of a winter campaign here as rain and snow in this limited space would be anything but pleasant. However, we have a month before the cold sets in so that many things can happen in that time. With fondest love to selves &amp; Pat and hoping you are all in the best of health<br/>I am, Your loving Son<br/>Terence<br/>P.S. This Paper (The Peninsula Press) is published by the Head Quarters here twice a week for general information TWG</p>
