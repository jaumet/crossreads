Sister to this &ndash; told me by one of our boys.   At one of the Tommy Camps in the desert the Quarter master Sergeant was simply hated by them &amp; they wondered how they could dispose of him.  To this consternation it killed him.  Never found out.  I asked what was done to them &amp; would you believe it the Tommy Officers blamed the Australians.  Said that such a think they would never have thought of unless put there by the Australians.</p>
