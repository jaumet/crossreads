 superb . Round Zonnebek , the battlefield is now a success of miniatur pond ? pitfal for the unwari , as they are as treacher as quicksand . It is a fair hell of a prospect if our fellow or ani other have to pass winter in this muck . Ear morn I visit the " Birdcag " at Hoograaf ; where about 600 prison are intern from yesterday 's battl . Most they are mediocr physiqu , though one notic an occasion fine specimen . They appear right glad to be in our hand , their general opinion is that Germani is done . They express great wonder at our vast artilleri resourc so they might , for the gun stretch in line over the countri the ground is pave with shell . I took a number of photograph amongst them they will submit ; except a brigadi , who turn his back on the camera . I did not press the point out of courtesi .
