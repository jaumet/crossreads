 Did I ask you for Agnes, Bessie &amp;  Vi's address. I thought I had them. Tell them I have not forgotten them but will write, give them my love.

Hope you are all well  &amp; that I shall soon receive letter from you all. What was the Photo like? Has Moth &amp; Eddy had their's taken. Fondest love    &amp;  kisses From Your loving daughter Edith
