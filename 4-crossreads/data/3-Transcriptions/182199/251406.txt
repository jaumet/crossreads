<p>Dear Mr Justice Street</p>
<p>I write to express my deep sympathy with Mrs Street and yourself in &nbsp;your great loss and to give you any information I can of the sad circumstances. &nbsp;Terrible as your loss is it must be softened when you know that Laurence met his death fighting gallantly for his country in the front line of battle. &nbsp;We had all been on the alert all night - 18/19th May, information having been received that the enemy had been strongly reinfored and would probably attack at dawn. &nbsp;This information proved correct and a heavy engagement commenced at 3 a.m. &nbsp;I will not attempt to describe this battle, but I can say that we repulsed with heavy loss&nbsp;the enemy who had far superior numbers. &nbsp;The behaviour of our boys was&nbsp;magnificent. &nbsp;Laurence was in command of B company and doing solid good work. &nbsp;He had his company in position in good time, but very sad</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
