 Dear Mrs Ferguson, 
 I simply cannot tell you how very sorry I am to hear about poor Arthur. I only got definite news of his being killed yesterday. I had seen Captain A. Ferguson in the Times casualty list but there was no detail given of regiment. I immediately wrote to the Australian Military Offices in London but they absolutely ignored me letter. I was awfully afraid it might be Arthur so I wrote to Mr Box at the High Commissioner's office. I had only met Box once but I knew of no one else who could get me definite news. He was awfully nice & sent me the letter which I enclose. I think it is very good of him yo go to so much trouble and I am sure you will be glad to have his letter. 
 I feel very sad at the news, both because I thought such a lot of Arthur and because I know what a terrible thing it is for you all. He was an awfully fine man and I am proud of having known him. 
 I know what a great sacrifice you made in letting him and Keith go, and I feel for you very much in your great sorrow. This war is an awful thing, and I think that those of you who have to stay at home and wait have by far the hardest and noblest shore of all. I cannot write ant more at present - it is so very hard. 
 Believe me Yours very sincerely, Geoffrey Forest Hughes
