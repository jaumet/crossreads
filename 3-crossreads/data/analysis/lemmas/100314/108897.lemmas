 Amien insid and found a servic of some kind in progress . An age priest haranng from the old elev pulpit to a small congreg of women and children . Had a look at the Cri Angel and the veri fine and ancient window behind the sanctuari All the carv of the choir is cover by sandbag and hidden from view . There are two splendid rose window one on each side of the nave . All these thing I have seen befor but there is a sever beauti about Amien that is not elsewher . On go out had anoth glanc at the front of the place and then walk back to the Club . Crowd of Tommi , Scotch , Canadian , American French soldier in the street . A dull cold drizzl in old street . Church bell quiet ring
