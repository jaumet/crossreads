28/3/18 ? La Basse Ville
line. Some runner. Cursing sliding and falling in the mud we reached No. 9 post dug in between the sleepers of a railway esconsced in an ruined railway truck. We had a patrol out in front. On the left is a fair sized lagoon. Minnies were hurtling over sending up clouds of mud water. Visited all the posts found all the men uniformly cheerful and happy. On the right they told me "?es only gotter grey whiskered old bloke here who rides up and down firing off flares". A few flicks of m.g. fire. Did not reach H.Q. until 2 a.m.
