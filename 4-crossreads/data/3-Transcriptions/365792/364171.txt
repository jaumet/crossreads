<p>Apl 2 morning while we were at Church (Some of the roads are made of square stone blocks (about 4 x 4), &amp; the edges are lined with metal. Went for a long walk this afternoon passing along the Canal enroute while several Tommies &amp; some of our chaps were fishing &amp; swimming. Guess the water was rather cool too much so for this chick. Nearly all flat or undulating country in this vicinity, &amp; well cultivated it is too. The hedges are just beginning to shoot, as also are most of the trees. Nearly every kiddy one meets in the street is anxious to get a Souvinir, but the boys are just about cleaned out, &amp; stony too for that matter. Rather long twilight; can read till after 7. Special coal on the trains :- (oblong blocks) which emits very little black smoke. Jolly good Concert tonight. Band being present  A large fire was lighted in the courtyard, chairs were placed for the ladies, the boys assembled round</p>
