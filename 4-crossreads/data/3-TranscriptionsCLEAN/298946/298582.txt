I was on the forward well deck and saw several of the men rush aft at the sounding of the siren four times.  Immediately a boat was lowered from the port side, & pulled around into the wake we had left behind us.  Meanwhile the ship had turned right around so that we could see the lifeboat bobbing about in the wake off  our starboard side.  Several lifebuoys & belts were to be seen floating towards us from our late course, but no sigh of the man. He was one of the husbands and had fallen off the poop deck right at the stern. Soon another boat was lowered fro the starboard side, taking a little longer
