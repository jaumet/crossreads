<p>128<br/>&amp; letter from Brisson I promptly answer them while I am in the humour. Having finished all correspondence &amp; having written this up to date I decide to make some friendly calls &amp; will probably be invited out to dinner</p>
<p>In the afternoon I visited Dr Courmontagne &amp; find that his wife has returned &amp; he is waiting for his little boy who is going to the picture show to come in prior to going to a musical afternoon at Saucet. Mde comes down dressed &amp; we adjourn to the bureau of M. Benard who is the possessor of a cello &amp; or rather viola without the E string.</p>
<p>We then adjourn to Saucet &amp; enter the room which has one side panelled to cover a series of shelves &amp; cupboards within &ndash; a handy way of disposing of necessary but encumbering furniture. [A small sketch inserted here].</p>
<p>Afternoon tea consists of cake &ndash; followed by pastry &amp; then light round [indecipherable] biscuits. This is usual afternoon tea. Often a liqueur is added.</p>
<p>The playing was rather good Benard made horrible face &amp; seemed to get some notes out with his tongue judging from the way he used to roll it it. At 8 pm we adjourned [indecipherable] Courmontaigne et supped soup &ndash; eggs &ndash; chops &ndash; cheese &ndash; pastry &ndash; (chocolate in fingers with cream interior) coffee &amp; liqueurs Red wine through the meals.</p>
<p>As the family are very sleepy I retire to bed early &amp; on arrival at my billet</p>
