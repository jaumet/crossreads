<p>It was the worst night I experienced for ages arrived back in camp at 4am and dog tired. Beautiful day. Heavy artillery action.<br/>13th Each day up to date has had its thrills- yesterday while out with a convoy I ran into a very heavy thunderstorm which strange to say took place only in the region of the trenches. Needless to say I became soaking wet. Today we break up and return to our units.<br/>17th out with convoy to Birthday Farm (Messives Ridge). Fritz was too busy so returned home very lucky to do so.</p>
