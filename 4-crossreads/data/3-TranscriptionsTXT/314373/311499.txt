 inviting, for there was a mass of rugged hills right to the sea separated by low depressions, all of a sandy nature, without vegetation and looking scorched up. The sunset was very pretty, whilst out to the right a lonely hill stood out sharpe against the sky and connected with the main mass of hills by a very long stretch of low lying sand, the whole lot bathed in a curious red glow. Monday 17.1.16. &ndash; We only caught a glimpse of land a couple of times to-day and these with a few passing ships kept the men occupied going from side of the ship to the other for it takes very little to interest them after the tedious run across the Indian Ocean.
