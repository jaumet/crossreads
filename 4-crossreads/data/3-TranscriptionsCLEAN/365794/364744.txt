Thursday 6 December 1917Rec'd note from S. Cuthbert, Citadel Hosp. only arrived Monday after 3 months on the trip from Australia.  Left 2 wks before me, arrived Durban safely, lay 5 wks there then across to Bombay in a new boat, then refused landing at B'bay so transferred to another boat & finally landed Port Tewfik & sent P. Said, Alex. & to Nazereah.Citadel impresses me strongly.  Am reading "Curse of the Nile" and one feels a shiver down one's back when driving through those old gloomy buildings.
