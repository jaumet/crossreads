<p>In this battle every quality that could satisfy the greatest and most critical Commander was demonstrated &ndash; resourcefulness, great physical endurance, speed in movement, masterly daring, absolute courage, the resistance of rock , smallness of numbers. and initiative which springs from the intelligence of the troops.
