<p>pretty thoroughly &amp; our cases diagioned, here I was marked "Severely" &amp; placed in a tent along with a lot more to await the arrival of the Red Cross train which was due at 10. I lost consciousness here for a while &amp; came round just before we were being placed in the train at a little station called Erquinham, they put me in a good bed in the train &amp; a nurse came round &amp; took my temperature eased my bandages &amp; in general made things much more comfortable after this I was able to drink a little tea &amp; eat a small slice of bread &amp; butter, but sleep I could not for the pain was too bad so I just had to lay there &amp; bear it as best I could, &amp; it made me bite my lip pretty hard at times but I stuck it out, we pulled in at</p>
