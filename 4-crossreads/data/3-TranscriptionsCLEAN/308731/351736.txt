Dear Mr Jampot.
I went to school to-day and we never had Dictation and I am glad because I do not like Dictation. and Grandma is here.  How do you like you name called Jampot.  Ruth is reading. and we have just had tea and we had fairy cakes and tost and butter. and now Ruth is clearing the table and mum is getting the wood for the fire. and the mame of this book is dew drop don't you think it is a funny name. and mum is reading the paper. and we are siting in front of the fire.  Mum went to meat us to day and Keith white was trying to ride the tryckill. and mum is going to read a story to us.
