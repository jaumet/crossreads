  
 5 March, 1916 Sunday This morning we all had to go to Church Parade, General Birdwood was there & he had a look at us.  There are rumours afloat again that we are to go to France & that they are going to form up a division of Light Horse  This after noon we rode across to the canal & had good swim, its a treat.
