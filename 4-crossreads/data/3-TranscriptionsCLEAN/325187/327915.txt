 Hot as Hell.  Marched all night & all day.  Horses tucked up wont drink Brackish water heavy sand, destroyed Wells & burnt some Huts took a few Bedouin prisoners but it is rough on the men & horses. We take our Wireless Plant with us on Camels & when the little oil engine is started it sounds in the dark just like an aeroplane & the men tumble out & until when very tired [indecipherable] would not leave them. Total No.6 Bad Writing & Ink has its disadvantages but it makes these notes so hard to read that a Censor soon gets fed up.
