<p>Monday Oct 15<br/>Another dust storm. What a desolate God forsaken hole this part of Palestine is. Sand seems to work its way in everything.<br/>Tuesday Oct 16<br/>Saw another air scrap to day. Hun brought down secured piece of wing as souvenir.<br/>Heavy bombardment. Seems general opinion we are likely to move any time now.<br/>Wednesday Oct 17<br/>Hot day. Flies &amp; Sand bad<br/>Mail in afternoon. Received two parcels so cheered up</p>
