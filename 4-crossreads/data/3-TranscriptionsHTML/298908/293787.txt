<p>From Paddington I went by tube to Picadilly &amp; into the Trocadero for lunch, pretty flash you know for this is one of London's leading restaurants &amp; things are done in style there, you go into a lovely big hall &amp; there little page boys meet you dressed in brown suits &amp; bright shiny buttons all over they take your hat &amp; stick &amp; give you a ticket, then there is a manager or something at the entrance &amp; he takes your name if the restaurant is full &amp; when your turn comes calls out your name &amp; a sort of shop walker guides you to your seat, pulls the chair out &amp; when you stand close to the table pushes it under for you &amp; you sit down, then along comes your waiter dressed immaculately in black &amp; white &amp; puts a menu all French on your table takes your order &amp; away he goes.  They wait on you hand &amp; foot here in fact almost feed you, then when you have finished they bring your account along on a silver salver</p>
