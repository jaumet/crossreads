We wandered back through the Citadel some "Tommy" welsh miners volunteered to show us the well that Joseph was put in. It was getting dark but we went down. It is about 400 ft deep about 25 ft by 20 ft : cut through solid rock : round the well is a passage about 6 ft wide high enough to walk upright in by which we descended a couple of hundred feet. As the tunnel winds down "windows" have been cut into the well the thickness between tunnel well is about 6 inches : the work all through is wonderful. On reaching the landing we found one of the old cog wheels (wood) used ages ago to draw water from the bottom a similar wheel on top (still there) used to draw it up to the top. It was too dark to descend lower so we dropped stones it seemed a long way down to the water. After an interesting chat with the "Tommies" we took the tram back had a feed at the soldier's Club in the Y.M.C.A. "Park" (Esbekiah Park) This is a nice place for a cheap good feed Then we took the tram home amp altogether had a very interesting afternoon's ramble. I got the neck of an earthenware bottle down the bottom of the well. It teemed after tea we got wet going home. Tent pretty dry during night.
