<p>16/10/15<br/>Up and into full fighting kit (an operation taking 30 seconds) at 0330.  All cooks batmen &amp;c turned out.  RSM &amp; Pioneers at ammun. reserve everyone took post.  At 0400 on signal the demonstration took place, two mines exploded near Crater and shook the whole earth.  Our rifle fire was not heavy enough in volume to draw much from them but when the Turks were all standing to and their trenches full our artillery suddenly opened.  <br/>The big shells bursting on crowded trenches must have killed &amp; wounded a fair number.  Only a couple in reply from them.<br/>Sounds of intermittent cannonade from direction of the Narrows and also from towards Cape Hellas.  All quiet here 0500 except for the usual cracking sound of bullets landing and the reverberation of others down Wire Gully</p>
<p>Petrass returned from <strike>Cape Hellas</strike> Imbros last night with canteen stores.  Sending Hogarth with 4 men to bring them up at 1000 this morning &ndash; mules ordered for then  Large orders cleared place right out and our &pound; 32 was cut down to &pound; 18.  24th  &pound;400 down to &pound; 25.  Fresh stocks arriving so our big order should go through without trouble.  Getting contents of boxes so things may be bought by the box in future.  Rough trip over there</p>
