 Dear Arthur 
 Will you post the enclosed to Ferguson Judge. 
 Just prior to leaving Durban the Firemen who had looked upon the wine when it was red, did some funny business on the Wharf, & got into holts with the South African Police. 
 The S.A.P. were not big chaps but perfect artists at their job - & they finished the affair in no time. 
 I wish you had been there - you would have thoroughly enjoyed it. 
 [The above written by C. M. to which Arthur D Fisher added a footnote] 
 The above will explain the enclosure which I also duly received & hasten to send along.
