SEPT.   FRIDAY 29   1916
Cold & raining most of the day. All the signalling class was in the huts all day doing buzzer work. Poss & I went into Amesbury in evening to have dinner with Colonel Abbott & Miss Ross but we could not get a car to come back so we went to the pictures on top of Larkhill & they were not much good.
