He returned to Sydney on 24 July 1919 having received the Ordre De verite Agricole - Chevalier from the President of the French Republic and being mentioned in Dispatches and receiving the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, for services in connection with military operations in France.] [We've Belgium's shattered homes to show the ways of war, Let's not forget we're here to save our own. "Twas that fact that lay before us, And from peace and comfort tore us, That war's horrors may not touch our Southern Zone 
 We can't say where we may be, or what we may have seen By the time this card may reach our Wattle land; But here's health and greeting to you, And our kindest though pursue you, With this message "Passed by Censor' from our hand. S.D. Leslie]
