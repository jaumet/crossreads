   Entering Enemy Trenches:  First lie up for nights under his parapet and learn his habIts - by listening you can judge with reasonable accuracy his method of holding, his strength and habits, choose to enter in a place or at a time when no one is about and work away always securing your retirement and marking your gap.
 
   Return journey to be accomplished as carefully as journey out (for instance Burglar's methods) information secured is useless when enemy is aware that we have it, in fact it is dangerous as he may guess our plans and provide against it.
 
   Enter trench cautiously and then advise the posts that you are in.  Every man should be examined for information and if not asked should insist on telling all he saw and heard.
 
   Aids to Direction:  Know your s tars.  When going out notice which side of your face the wind blows on.  Pick up landmarks, as salients and re-entrants in the wire, trees, ditches, craters, and if lost, lie down and wait until many verey lights have been sent up.  Usually the British line is quiet and dark, but the German uses lights throughout the night.
 
   Patience:  A scout's most useful qualification.
 
   Communication.  To be made as silently as possible by pressure of hand and by the use of string signals.
   Action on Meeting Enemy Patrol.  If fighting patrol avoid them, go back and ^Secure machine gun fire about the spot.  If reconnaissance patrol avoid them - they will probably do the same if they see you.  If it looks an easy snap attack them, but remember you are armed for defence and have only a few bombs and no long range weapons.
