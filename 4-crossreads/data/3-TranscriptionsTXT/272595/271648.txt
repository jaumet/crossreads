praise for the marvellous fighting they have done.This afternoon after tea Lindsay & I went for a walk down to Shearwater a very pretty sheet of water from which the Camps round here drain their water supply  it lies in a lovely little valley clothed on both sides by beautiful trees & pretty little cottages are sprinkled all over the place  there is a nice little path & road which runs round the lake & is largely patronized by the girls round this quarter, I took my camera with me & got a few snaps  on our way back we met Jack Gribble I had not seen him for ages & we had quite a long yarn, he wants Lindsay & I to come round to his diggings tomorrow & meet a few more of his pals, Jack has been in trouble over his Italy stunt
