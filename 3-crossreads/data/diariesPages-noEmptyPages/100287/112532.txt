to stop in it much longer. I am certain I would run amuck break all sorts of regulations, now the war is over I consider myself a civilian anything Military I thoroughly detest. never no more for me, the only time I would fight again is in defence of my own country, I would never go out of "Aussie" seeking stouch I have had my fill of it, at the same time I am glad I came to this I will never regret it as long as I live, but now the job is done I want to be out of it.
Theres 2 things I have noticed since leaving Suez, one is the way the days are lengthening the sun don't set now till 6 o'clock, the second is the way the stars are altering in the heavens especially what a lot of us call the "arm chair" the back points towards the earth now is shifting gradually northwards.
