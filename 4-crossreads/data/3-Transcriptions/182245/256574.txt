<p>28 WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>Fine but dull. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness all morning &amp; we</p>
<p>went out exercising horses</p>
<p>in afternoon. We have to</p>
<p>go out with bandoliers ect</p>
<p>now &amp; the O C waggon lines</p>
<p>has to be with all exercising</p>
<p>parties. No letters from home</p>
<p>yet &amp; all the others have got&nbsp;</p>
<p>late letters. Wish they would</p>
<p>turn up.</p>
