<p>Somewhere In France<br/>17/6/17</p>
<p>To Mrs Fletcher</p>
<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>Just a few lines solely to express to you my very deepest sympathy for the loss of your grand little Soldier Son. Not only a pall of mine , but loved by all who knew him, Tom and I spent many wearey hour together on the fire step, And his smiling face and usual humour turned a snowy night into sunshine, In losing your son we lost a thorough soldier, plenty of spirit, and all the determination of a true Britisher, Like others he made the supreme sacrifice, <u>But</u> not untill our Battalion had gained a splendid victory in a glorious battle, Another consoling feature was that he suffered no pain, being killed by an exploding shell, I have been asked by several of the Bingara boys to convey on thier behalf the same message to yourself and all other relatives and friends, Those boys in particular were greatly moved by the loss of one who had been their lifelong Comrade,<br/>So now dear Madam I must conclude</p>
