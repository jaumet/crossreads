  
 soaked & weary men heartily cursed the weather, the war & even their existence. Its terrible that these poor soaked wretches have to go up into the front trenches this evening, & there be subject to the wretched weather & the hellish shelling. The misery of it all is too terrible & appalling for words. Photographs of Second Division going up on busses. 
 27th Octr. Saty Early move at 8 am & arrived at Ypres 9.30 am. The road much congested with traffic & muddy. The Boche is now settling down to winter positions, & as we can no longer push forward on account of the frightful mud, he has had time to register his artillery. This has had the effect of jeopardising all points where traffic is busy & also traffic routes & salient places. Ypres is still being harassed & last night was bombarded with his long range guns & Gothas.
