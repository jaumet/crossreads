<p>Dear Mrs. John</p>
<p>I have just got two letters from you numbered 36 and 37:  in one you had been most horribly busy during the preceeding week, and said you were sorry not to have written to me:  I think it wonderfully nice of you to write at all, and of course felt very conscious stricken at the weeks I've missed in answering your letters:  perhaps you meant it as a rebuke for me, if so, it was very subtle.</p>
<p>But then, knowing you, I should not expect you to worry about such round-a-bout methods &ndash; I've always found you wonderfully straigtforward.</p>
<p>Your letters were written from some little heathen towns down along the South Coast &ndash; how I should have enjoyed being there, and would have disagreed with you about any cruelty in catching fish, they are too cold blooded to feel anything:  I am sorry Stella does not like your protegee Stewart Walker, perhaps</p>
