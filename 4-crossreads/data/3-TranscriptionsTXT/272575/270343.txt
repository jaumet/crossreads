It is a pleasure to walk along the roads here now and see the various crops when we passed through this part a couple of months ago.   The crops were just springing and the Hop vines were just shooting, now the Hops are growing luxuriantly, they are worth seeing here they do not grow them on Poles, but on wires first they erect their posts for the top wires they are about 20 feet from the ground.   then fine wires are attached to these overhead wires and fastened to pieces of stronger wire, which are set firmly in the ground.   The vines are trained on the small wires, they look very pretty growing and I should think that they would be far easier to harvest than when grown on poles, other crops Wheat & Oats give promise of a plentiful harvest   But Beans & Peas they grow here to perfection whether they bear well is another thing.  The Peas & Broad beans grow better, than I have ever seen them before if good green foliage is any Criterion.   Red Clover is another crop that grows well.  the farmers have cut the first crop for hay and it is still out in the pad fields curing in some places they are cutting grass for hay today I saw a load on the road when we were marching along.   how long we will be in this part of France I cannot say not very long I think.
