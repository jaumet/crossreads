This is a perfect swelter of a day & makes one wish there was no such place as Egypt.Late last night J Rolfe called on me to say goodbye as he has to go to Tel-el-Kebir to-day.We have also been ordered to hold ourselves in readiness to shift at a days notice, but goodness only knows where to. I believe they are rushing our complement of men & horses through so as to get us away.There is nothing much to report as we are only engaged on ordinary transport duties, which are beginning to become a little irksome.  I wish to goodness they would send us to France or some other place.I tried a new riding Horse last night & nearly cracked my neck in doing so. Four of us went out on a 7 mile ride & going through Matarieh we opened them up to a gallop.  My beggar proved to be both touchy & a stumbler & fell twice but I managed to free myself.  He wont do Richard so - Reject.  On returning home I had to take poor old Bill Cousins to Hospital.
