I notice that amongst those who had never seen a foreign shore before this time, talk very loundly on how they dealt with the native when he bought anything. Probably the native got the best of the bargain after all is said and done.

There are a very large number of jack-daws, both in the streets of Colombo and also in the harbour.

Dec 29th.

Had a few hours ashore this forenoon. Warned that all parties were to be aboard at 2 o’clock.

I had a very pleasant walk through the streets again. Brt. a few precious stones (?) moonstones are very lucky, so the native said from whom I brt. them. Brt. a copy of English Songs and Ballads from one of the biggest booksellers shops here. Strange to say a portrait of "Robbie Burns" graced the frontispiece. A nurse was taken aboard the ship on a stretcher suffering from sunstroke.

Going over to Colombo in a small boat was a most hair-raising experience. There was a fair breeze blowing and coupled with the unskilfulness of the boatsmen I really thought every minute we were going to be upset.

We had a slightly better experience on our return journey but I never felt safe until I set foot on board the ship again.
