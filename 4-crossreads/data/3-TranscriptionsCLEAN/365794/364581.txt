  
 Friday 28th June 1917 [1918] Am very happy in my work & giving every possible energy to it.  Men appreciate my efforts as to clean shirts, ties, etc.  Dr. Wilson a very charming woman & a pleasure to talk to her.  Miss Low, home sister, has a hard expressionless face & our harem is simply filthy, bad food & dirty quarters.  Both Matrons evidently regard us as immoral women & try to suppress us in every possible way as to late passes etc.
