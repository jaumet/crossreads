<p>[Wednesday 8 November 1917]</p>
<p>Still blowing a gale but things in general are better.  We get wireless news of how the war is going but nothing else, writing is difficult, the sea is so rough-<br/>We are now off <strike>Cape Finistiere</strike> &amp; the Spanish Coast-<br/>You will notice I am using the end of 1917 Diary anticipating I shall not be soldiering when 1917 November comes round!!!<br/><strike>Dear little Mother I dreamt about you last night &amp; could see you all so plainly at Bronte.  It is a great comfort to feel Joe is keeping every thing going &amp; you are well.  I hope it was not selfish [indecipherable] to many.</strike></p>
