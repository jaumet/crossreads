<p>wrote one, which was the answer for everybody.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of Monday 1st I went with two other Englishmen and a Russian, to visit another Englishman, (named Lounds) who was working at a factory where the Coffee &amp; Meat extract cubes were made. H showed us all over the place, (which was very dirty ) and also showed us what the coffee &amp; meat Extract was made from. The coffee was made from the refuse of Vinyards that is, the skins, storks &amp; seeds of the grapes, after all the juice had been drawn from them &amp; fermented. The stuff smelt awful, and fowls were walking over it and scratching it about. I didn't drink much German coffee for a long time after that. The Meat Extract cubes were manufactured form Potato peelings and course salt.</p>
<p>On Sunday the 7th Reports say that the Germans have taken three more villages 15,000 Prisoners and another 200 guns.</p>
<p>The weather for the past week has been fine but cold. The food as usual, bad. To-day Monday 8th April is a little windy and cold.</p>
