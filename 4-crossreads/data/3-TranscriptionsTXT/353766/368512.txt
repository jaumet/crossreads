 Weather continues heavy. Was on bridge today (22nd). Spray rose quite 70 feet above f'c'sle, beautiful sight. Running out of north east trades into the prevailing Westerlies. Sunday   Jan 24   in latitude Gibraltar. We are all thinking what a surprise it will be to many folks in E when this ship gets there. Most interesting subject of conversation at present is the matter of leave. 25th.  Weather rough. Interesting incident today. German prisoners on board since Jan 6 &amp; the officers so appreciate kindness &amp; courtesy w. wh. they have been treated from the first that they wanted to make some acknowldgemt. to the ship. That is where I come in, as an unofficial person, &amp;  with an excess of politeness I broke it to them that it is quite out of the question. In these days of evil recriminations, just as well to record the above. Press news today comes from Malta, telling of sinking of "Blucher" &amp; etc. They were off on another baby killing raid, I expect. Strange! When we were in Pacific a persistent rumour had the Blucher in Indian Ocean.
