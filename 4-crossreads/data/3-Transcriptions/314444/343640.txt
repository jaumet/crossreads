<p>Dear Mother &amp; Father</p>
<p>I hope you have recieved my two previous letters also post cards &amp; presents.<br/>Well I hope you are both keeping well &amp; enjoying best of health as I am. There is no mistake about my health. I have never felt so well in all my life. I never even have a head ache. I get up feeling tip top and after the days work I feel quite fresh.<br/>We do a lot of night work. but it is all interesting, and you have your mind on it all the time. We have plenty of digging and it makes the muscles very hard. I can march for hours on the desert now and not feel it at all, so you can see we have improved out of sight since we arrived. I can tell you the Turks will know it when the 19th arrive on the scene. They are</p>
