all the difficulties I slept very well having on all clothes boots etc - feet were cold all night though.11/10/17 Have been busy drying blankets etc. Then we rigged up a tent & cleaned rifles, bayonets, Lewis guns etc. Fell in 6pm for inspection then had stew & at 6.45pm moved off to front line in single file. I started off with 4 panniers of ammunition for Lewis Gun but soon broke down with its weight so Henry (the officer) took 2 panniers & Andy 2. About 1/2 hr after took 2 off Andy & took them right into action. Had very rough march in dawn up
