<p>a curio shop then returned to camp &amp; met Will Drummond &amp; went around Cairo.</p>
<p>Sunday   met a friend now S. Baker who gave me two tents so shifted our quarters   We also had orders to mess with the ninth so are  in a fairway of becoming comfortable  Into Cairo at night.  Just like a weekday as Friday is the Mohommedans Sunday.</p>
<p>Monday    nil.</p>
<p>Tuesday   went to meet Will D. at Mena but he had already departed so spent the day there resting &amp; looking at the pyramids &amp; Sphinx will make another visit.</p>
<p>Wednesday<br/>Given duties at last.  Attended sick parade &amp;  had to make an inventory of natives employed in Camp.  They totalled 1500.</p>
<p>Thursday 1st April  orders came to pack up &amp; join our unit at once:  our kits were placed on a wagon &amp; we marched to the tram where we entrained for Mena.  We arrived there to find the men out on a route march.</p>
<p>Good Friday  Church parade in morning was very disappointing.  A very imposing square was formed &amp; General Bridge attended but service was flat, no singing worth mentioning.  Remainder of day, a holiday &amp; spent the time doing Photos with Will. D.  At night we took candles &amp; went through all three pyramids refusing the service of a guide.  The first pyramid Cheops was fairly easy the biggest danger being from slipping for which purpose shoes or bare feet are necessary.  The passage way is worn</p>
