It is most disappointing that the parcels you sent me should have gone down in the Arabia  as I was looking forward to them no end. However some of them may have been saved and will be waiting for me when I reach the Battery.
I just missed seeing Gerald the day before I left Salisbury - Found he was at Lark Hill, about 16 miles away, but had no time to run across and see him.
Will be anxious to hear from Ted whether you have cabled definitely about coming over.
Must stop now to catch the mail. Your loving Son
