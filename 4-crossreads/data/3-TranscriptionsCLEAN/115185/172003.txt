I just go on from day to day doing my work as it comes to my hands - as well as I can. I do not look for praise or interest from the matron or M.O.'s or for recommendation from the matron to the matron in chief. I am not in the least popular - and am kept well in the back ground - in all ways. The work I was given here was not expected to be of such importance as it has turned out to be - and the Major Gibson had the name of being very difficult to get on with and satisfy. I think he has reported nurses for slackness etc. But he has got very dependant on me and likes having me with him, so I am quite happy and I am glad to be working with a man who is a gentleman - and not as many of these M.O.s are - cads as far as women go and very self seeking and afraid to take the consequences of their actions. But I'm a nasty woman saying such unkind things
