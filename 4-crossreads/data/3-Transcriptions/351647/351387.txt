<p>had a good time.  I was surprised at your going but hope it did you good &amp; set you up.</p>
<p>You were having a rotten time before.  The mails are still quite mad &amp; several of your letters &amp; Mother's too I haven't had yet.</p>
<p>Well I must flee &amp; go to bunk.  The bung bungs are starting &amp; they are not conducive to good or intelligent writing.  I saw a Tank.  My dear they are weird quite the ugliest thing I've ever seen &amp; they look so alive &amp; sort of intelligent but in a slow &amp; dogged &amp; purposeful way.  Crash &amp; very nice too.</p>
<p>Good night<br/>Much love<br/>James</p>
