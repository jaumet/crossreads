<p>7/6/19 Sutton-Veny<br/>A hot day. Many men have applied for leave and there are many changes in the quota. Inspected the huts of No. 3 Company and noticed a great improvement in camp sanitation this morning. The Billjims had the usual number of more or less well grounded grouses on the matter of food. In the evening watched Gorman and others gambling at card roulette in the mess.</p>
<p>8/6/19<br/>A quiet idle day in camp and in the evening took a walk in the woods close to the camp.</p>
<p>9/6/19<br/>Inspected lines. Roused up the camp Quartermaster and made some different arrangements about food question. Afternoon went with Major &amp;  Mrs Blanch to tennis and after mess went to an evening given by the nurses and passed the time very enjoyably until about 10.45.</p>
