<p>February, 1917. Saturday 10<br/>Stayed in bed all morning. Fine and warmer &amp; no wind. Told I would get to-night off but order countermanded and supposed to go out with Walsh wiring (?) Feel tired and feet bad. Decided later I wouldn't go out so risked it and was all right. Slept well and was refreshed.</p>
