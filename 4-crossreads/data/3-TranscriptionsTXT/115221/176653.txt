Dear Mr. & Mrs. Gordon,
I was very sorry upon hearing the news yesterday of poor Alan's death from wounds received in our second occasion of fighting in the Somme Battle.
Being one of my best mates in this Battalion we were always anxious to find out about one another.
When the Australians took the village of Pozieres, the Bombing Section of our Battalion, which Alan was Corporal of, did splendid work, the Lieut in charge, being awarded the Military Cross, and Sgt. Baxter (now seriously wounded) the D.C.M.  Alan's name appeared in orders issued by our Commanding Officer for splendid services in this engagement.
The last time I saw Alan, I remember it quite well, it was August 15th about 6 p.m., we were all ready to march up to the Pozieres section (second occasion) and the Bombers marched past us, Alan waved to me and asked the following question, "Well, Wal, how do you like your chance this time".  I might say that this question was commonly asked of by the boys, especially those who were lucky and thankful to have come through on the first occasion.
Alan was wounded about the face and neck, I did not see him myself, but from enquiries which I made it appears the Bombers were in "No man's land" bombing a German trench, the Germans saw or heard them and started throwing bombs, one of these wounded Alan, evidently it affected his sight for a minute or so, as he lost his bearings where our trench was, as he was singing our "Which is the way, Come out and help me in".  Some of the boys sang out and he quickly found his bearings and managed to work his way back to our front trench, where he was attended to by the stretcher bearers, and a few hours later walked to the dressing station.  I did hear that he passed through the 3rd Bn. line on his way to the dressing station, as he gave a message to a 3rd Bn. boy to let Jack Nunn know he was wounded.  I have not seen Jack since then.
I made several inquiries off the Bombing section to see if they had heard from Alan, and at that time our casualties being very heavy (which no doubt you people in Australia know by this) it was almost impossible to trace anyone in the Hospitals.
