<p>27/5/18<br/>Have arrived so far, and just waiting a few hours for the next stage. The "beach" here, as I suppose they call it, has not a grain of sand, but is all stones, smooth, &amp; sizes from a pea to hens egg. Must go and get breakfast now. The sea out in front of here is thick with Patrol boats and warships, going up &amp; down all the time. love from Arthur</p>
