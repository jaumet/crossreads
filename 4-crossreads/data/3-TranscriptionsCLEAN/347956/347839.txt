 we fell in at 6 PM & were marched off for an hours lamp practice & were dismissed in time for the commencement of the concert which was a great success.  the Chairman read a telegram for George Reid saying he was sorry he could not attend as he had to appear at the Palace.  I suppose we shall see him along any day now.
