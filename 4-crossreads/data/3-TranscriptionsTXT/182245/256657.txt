22 TUESDAY
Raining all morning but
cleared up in afternoon. I
lay in the hut having a
rest in morning &amp; cleaned
my saddle in afternoon. Got
word that no ammunition
was wanted tonight, &amp; every
body very cheerful at the
prospect of a good sleep.
Got letters from Coomoo Coomoo,
Father, Mary Hill &amp; Linda.
