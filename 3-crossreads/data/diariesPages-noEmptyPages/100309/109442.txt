Breakfast in bed. Prepared to do some bomb practice during morning preparatory to an exhibition stunt at 2.15 pm when BM rang up and told me that Major General Smythe and his staff were coming down to see it at 11.15 am. Great preparations and over 2500 bombs to detonate and shift by limbers. Organized effort accomplished this and the stunt started. To time and worked fairly well but for details. The bomb supply was excellent and quite ample for our needs. Orders for another stunt arrived during the evening morning but I turned it over to Rodda to lick into shape and turned in for a rest. In the evening after mess rode out and reconnoitred the scene of tomorrows work and walked back to camp with two of my new subalterns Sutherland and Speck who are decent little chaps and full of quiet enthusiasm. Jack came in for a talk during the evening and stayed for a while. A quiet evening on the front. A balloon broke away today the crew parachuted.
