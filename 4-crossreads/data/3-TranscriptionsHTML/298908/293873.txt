<p>25th.  Got pooled for a route march this morning the first one I have done for 5 weeks so I can't complain.<br/>Blue Dimock &amp; I went down town <strike>this</strike> yesterday evening after tea we went for a stroll on the "Hoe" for an hour or so then down to the Theatre Royal where we booked seats for the usual Sunday evening concert.  Having an hour to spare we went round to "Goodbodys" &amp; had a cup of tea &amp; a few cakes &amp; then back to the concert.  It was rather longer than usual but there was the singer who stood out on her own Madame Nellie Stephenson, she has a lovely voice (soprano) &amp; I think everyone looks forward to her items, I know I do &amp; judging by the reception she gets the whole audience thinks the same way.<br/>Last night the D.29 was cancelled indefinitely &amp; our sailing has been put off till the 30th so heavens only knows when we will get away.</p>
