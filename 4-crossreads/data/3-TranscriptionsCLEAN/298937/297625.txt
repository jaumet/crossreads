  
 It may yet be cancelled however.  The 180 were put thro' an embarkation medical parade this afternoon & most of my staff is packed up, so all we can do is hang on & see what happens. It is no use writing letters for they will not be sent, but I would like to let Rita have the news. I am thinking of her more & more every day, & wishing I could only be back again.
