<p>was waiting, we were coupled on at the rear &amp; off we went for about 4  miles until Wardreques was reached when we uncoupled &amp; came back light engine, in coming through a big cutting between two overhead bridges the bank was hit in two places by Bombs, evidently been trying to blow up the bridges &amp; missed them.    The Country on both sides of the line looks beautiful, with several beautiful Chateau's among the trees.   Also passed over a canal which had several locks on one side, with the water pouring over, making minature waterfalls.   We both very much admired this scenery.  When we arrived back we were relieved at 5 Pm &amp; signed off after doing 11 hours for my first day's work.   During the Day there were several <strike>trucks</strike> vans put in a siding for us &amp; we all had to shift our kits once again, &amp; move into the vans.   There are 9 in our van &amp; we are very comfortable, we don't know how long we will be here as Fritz is attacking very strong close to Hazebruick which is only 14 miles away, we can hear the guns banging away<strike>[indecipherable]</strike> for all they are worth.</p>
<p>Wednesday 17/4/18.   I am off duty until required, otherwise waiting orders.   I was notified at 4 Pm to sign on at 5 Pm to proceed to Bolougne.   Having prepared my engine A Class No 1690 I left the Depot at 6 Pm &amp; ran Light Engine to a Station called Aire on the St Omer Berguette Line, &amp; after making a good run I arrived at Aire at 7 Pm</p>
