  
 with a sharp biting snap overhead & drone & whirr down towards the Gulf of Saros. 
 During the afternoon old Beachy Bill of worldwide fame, introduced himself & with a whistle & a thunderous report, burst his shrapnel overhead & down on to the Beach.  After the first discharge not a soldier was visible on the slopes & as our "Ranje" & the howitzers returned the fire they crouched lower.  A dozen shots & "Beachy" turned the game up & we fell in & marched round the coast to our lines.  After one halt at Casualty Corner, right in the danger zone, we reached our camping place  where just  at the foot of the firing line, just as Beachy started his music again.  A few discharges from one of our howitzers silenced him for the night & by the time the stars were shining only the bursts of firing from the M.G.s & the long rolls of thunder from the warships in the Narrows went to disturb our sleep.
