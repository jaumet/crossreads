<p>Thursday 25 May 1916<br/>Awake early, got things packed &amp; went along for breakfast to the butcher's shop. At 9 o'c we went to Div. H.Q. &amp; after a wait were spoken to by Maj. Gen. Walker, commanding the division. Thence to Brigade H.Q. &amp; after that to our battalions. I was at once allotted to "A" Co. &amp; on finding the O.C., Capt. Herrod, was very pleased : the other 3 officers, Lt. Hunter, Lt. Dewinton &amp; Lt. Cullenward are also very nice fellows, the latter having a brother living in Mowbrary Rd. at "Glenorkie", a place he frequently visits.<br/>Stayed with Capt. Herrod till lunch which we have in a cottage : one little tiled room is for the time allotted to me. The house where Leo was quartered last time I was here is only abt. 400 yds. away. Repacked the gear I brought in order to send part back again. Censoring letters in the afternoon. At tea word came that we were to supply a night fatigue &amp; I was sent with one party to a spot some distance behind the lines where a set of trenches that were overgrown &amp; therefore invisible had to be cleared &amp; made visible to enemy aircraft. Had some of my old men in the party, &amp; all worked splendidly, getting thro' with the job much quicker than was expected. March home thro' dark &amp; drizzling rain to welcome bed.</p>
