we wont get a move order suddenly, which would necessitate my going to Hospital. As these days one stands very little chance of getting back to the same unit after going to the Base, and I don't want to lose this Battery if I can help it -Letter from Sis a few days ago - all well there and they think their new home will be much healthier & pleasanter than West Avenue -
Glad Gerald G. is going into a How Battery  He will find it the most interesting work. Eric Richards, who is now a Major in command of an 18PR  Battery here is leaving for England
