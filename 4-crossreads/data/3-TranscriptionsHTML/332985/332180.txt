<p>coming out of action tomorrow night.</p>
<p>2-7-1917<br/>Fine day.  Saw today Major Heslop, he is now A.D.V.S. of this Division.  He inspected our horses, asking me how I was getting on.  Some big shell coming over near the water trough, about &frac12; mile from here.  Hun aeroplanes over.  The enemy got a direct hit on the railway line, almost carried away a bridge, missing it by inches.</p>
<p>3-7-1917<br/>Taking 4 guns of the relieving Bty. into position, and bringing 4 of our out;  going to workshops.  Gas alarm at 10 p.m.  Hooters and whistles blowing everywhere.  Gas cloud coming over, it did not reach us.  We have a percentage of horse gas helmets issued.  When this gas is on, our guns open up, to try and break it up.  The Artillery has opened up now 10-30 p.m.</p>
