<p>afternoon free, Reg, Bob, Nick &amp; I went again to Netley to the hospital.</p>
<p>Returned early, and, went after tea to the Palace Theatre where a piece "Kings &amp; Queens" was staged. The performance was enjoyable and we finished up with a midnight supper at the "Grosvenor" arriving on board at 1 am.</p>
<p>October 19th: -<br/>Leave stopped and therefore ward duties began again.</p>
<p>Sailed at 4 pm, having aboard, only 10 officers, 1 nurse &amp; 6 men, the latter coming from Weymouth depot. This turn of events was a surprise for we anticipated leaving with a full ship but it was announced that the rest were to be taken on at Malta, so we had the prospects of an easy trip until this place was reached.</p>
<p>Night cool but calm and sea smooth.</p>
<p>October 20th: -<br/>Cool still and very windy.</p>
<p>On ward D1 where the officers were situated and busy all day as the meal getting is a big item for men of rank.</p>
<p>Relieved at 5 pm and went to bed soon after tea. During the night sea became very choppy and a number of the boys heaved to again. I was fortunately OK.</p>
<p>October 21st: -<br/>Cool and very windy all day. On duty in D1 again throughout the day. Sister Treyhearne operated on for appendicitis. Slept on deck the wind easing after tea.</p>
