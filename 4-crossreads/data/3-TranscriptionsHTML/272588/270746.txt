<p>Wednesday 31 July<br/>A chap told us that he had it from Brigade that the Division is to be relieved on Friday.  To-night Perkins told us that the Division is to be relieved in a day or so &amp; we carry on here until to-morrow. Sudden!!  We are going well back but me thinks to join the other Divisions on the Somme. Only four gas patients from all yesterday's hostile shells.</p>
