loud report and on going on deck discoverer that the vessel immediately ahead of us had been torpedoed. She was at the time barely  a mile away. She was slowly settling down by the head and when we came up her crew were already in the boats. She was a fine vessel of about 4t500 tons and lay just behind us at Deal. By her condition it looked as though she might be saved. 
We continued our voyage towards Plymouth and running in close to the shore had a fine view of Eastbourne, Brighton and other watering places. Weather continued wretched and we ran into shelter
