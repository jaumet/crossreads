passage cut out of sand stone and showed us the the family tombs of the Romans; we could not understand how they worked it as the tombs were only pidgeon holes cut in the side of the passage however after a lot of trouble  the guide explained to us that they were cremated and only the jars of their ashes were put here.I am very lucky having such nice chaps as Rostron & Nelson to go about with and also Tim Alworth is here so I am well off for mates.You ought to have got my letters from Port Suez by this; I hope to get a great mail when I get back to camp again.That letter you wrote to me to Egypt (no. 1) had half a page on the back of it with nothing on it; please don't let that occur again!!We are issued with a green envelope here every week and they are not censored by officers who know us, however there is nothing in your letters that I mind them seeing and so unless I write and extra long letter to you or have any private business to tell I'll keep the green envelopes for writting to the girls! Hey?Will you send me a list of people who got my photos please, I am rather interrested about it.  Did Kitty get hers?  I guess poor Olives is right out of it - hope nobody cuts me out while I am away.  Love to Father. Wonder whether he is in Sydney now? Good bye Mother dearYour loving sonRob.
