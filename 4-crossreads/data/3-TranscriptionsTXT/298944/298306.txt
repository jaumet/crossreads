a few weeks ago. Our first disputes were tempered with a natural desire to get to the bottom of each with a view to knowing each other better. The later disputes were characterised by less tolerance. For my part, I was very intolerant & quite wrongly so. Still it seemed to me that no amount of looking into disputes and settling points would do any good so long as one of us was selfish & self willed. I dont feel at all inclined to be anything more than an acquaintance
