<p>3.  rather despairing over the delay in his letters; that of course will sound rather ridiculous to you when it is only just over a week since I had the last, and "despairing" was rather a strong word to use but you know what I mean.  It is so much more noticeable because I have so much time to think &amp; to watch for letters and because my future is so unsettled.  It seems so ridiculous to think that I hear from him in time, the next mail after this will bring me to you instead of letters, though on the other hand it may be weeks before we can come to an agreement through letters.<br/>You won't worry about me one atom will you, even if you still have received no cable re my homecoming when this gets to you, I shall be quite all right even if I have to stay on here for a while.  I won't deny that I find it trying but it is nothing to what lots of people have, and I shall philosophically try to make the best of it if I am detained on and on.  And you see the longer I am kept away from you the more I'll go mad over getting back &amp; having you again.<br/>To-day here has been very hot &amp; you poor dears would have thought it awful I know.  There has been a really hot wind blowing all day &amp; the fierce Eastern sun beating down mercilessly &amp; if I had had to be out in it much I should have made a fuss but I was only out for about an hour this morning.  Even here at home (home!!), I have been fairly soaking &amp; greasy faced &amp; dank haired but it has not concerned me.  I daresay it might take it out of one without knowing it but otherwise I'm sure it wouldn't trouble me.  And to think they are having it so cold in France!</p>
