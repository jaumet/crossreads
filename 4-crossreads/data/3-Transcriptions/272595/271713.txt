<p>&amp; had gone to sleep in his bed, you should have seen the look on Possy's face when he pulled the blankets off the supposed drunks face, laugh I nearly died!! &amp; in fact we all did.  Lindsay &amp; I paid Len a visit over at the OTB. last night, we played "bridge" till fairly late then came home in the moonlight.  I hear just after we left there was a big row there, &amp; Len threw a couple of them out by the scruff of the neck, he went on his final leave today before going to France.<br/>Have not long finished a big Dental roll for tomorrow, &amp; it is raining drearily though not very heavy.  Lindsay &amp; I have just come in from the canteen where we have just had our usual supper</p>
