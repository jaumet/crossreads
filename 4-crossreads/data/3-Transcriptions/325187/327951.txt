<p>[Thursday 27 July 1916]</p>
<p>Out again keeping Johnny Turk occupied- One bullet hit the sand about a yard from me this morning- it was as usual quite hot to handle.  Nearly got to England that time.<br/>Taubes spotting again   <strike>We are short of good big Battle Planes &amp; men to fly them.</strike><br/>We lost a couple of Horses &amp; one man wounded today, I dug a Mauser bullet out of the sand 2 yards from me- the Turks are using some of the old pattern Mausers, that make the double report- the bullet is the same.</p>
