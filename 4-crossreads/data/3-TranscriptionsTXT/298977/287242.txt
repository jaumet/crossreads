 France, 24th June 1916. 
 Dear Sister, 
 Yours of the 23rd April (just two months old) came along last night.  I have received a later one from you than this, so you can see the mail is all any how and I don't know where I stand. 
 Glad to have the new list of the Parish Volunteers and to see our name can top the list as regards numbers.  Some family us!   I'm rather inclined to think the Rector made a mistake in his classification of "H" 
 Geo Sharpe seems to have had a pretty bad time all through.  I tried to trace him when we were in Egypt but couldn't.  Yesterday evening we had about the worst thunderstorm I've seen since I've been away.  One I remember on Gallipoli came pretty near it, but this was a beauty.  It must have frightened old Fritz a bit, for he made things pretty willing while it lasted.  He seems to have caught the habit from Johnny Turk, as if the weather came up at all threatening, he always made things lively. 
 Will expect to see Billy over here shortly now.  By the way I don't think he will find Gladstone on the "Argylshire".  If my memory serves me right he was on the "Ayrshire" of the same Line. 
 Later.  Excuse the interruption.  I thought it had been too quiet this last half hour to last and I was right.  On a calm day the roar of this artillery is deafening.  An Artillery Duel gives you funny sensations.  Its both fascinating and terrifying, especially when its close at hand. 
 I see the Easter Show was about as per usual.  Its wonderful where the people come from these times. 
 Excuse the brevity (same old yarn) I've got a slight excuse this time though.  I've given my wrist a bit of a twist.  Skating in the muddy trenches and sitting down too sudden did it.  Nothing serious, can't even get off duty with it. 
 Love to all at home and hope all are well.  I'm feeling very fit but could do with about a week's sleep straight off to make up for lost time. 
 Love from Roy. 
 Just twelve months to-morrow since we left.  Have seen a little in that time.
