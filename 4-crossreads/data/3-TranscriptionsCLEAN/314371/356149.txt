  
 I was operated on & properly stitched up.  For the next four days I did not do too bad & was marked fit to go down to the base Hosp.  On the afternoon of the 30th I was put aboard the Hosp. train & carted down country to Etaples, where we were taken to No. 24 Gen. Hosp. where I have been ever since. 
 This is now the 22nd of Oct, I had some ups & downs & at present seem as far off getting to Blighty as when I arrived. 
 Nov. 12th Am making some definite progress at last, temperature is down & am feeling real good. 
 Nov. 18th Still going strong, marked improvement this week so am hoping for the Best.
