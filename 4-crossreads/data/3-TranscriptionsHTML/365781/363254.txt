<p>you get this. Your news in your letter of accounts was very pleasing to me I have always been thinking if you got on all right. Yes I did write to Jim(?) From Egypt? and asked him to ring(?) up so that if you did not get my letter you would know I had written. I shall not forget his attention. I know you would receive everything you wanted at the Staff Office. I have not had time to look up anybody &amp; cannot(?) to .... for any time and it takes plenty of that to find anyone here I did not hear of Cecil Bland or Ted Shield being wounded in fact it may take place at any time &amp; place here &amp; with out you have something to do with them you don't hear. What's left of our boys are looking a lot better they seem to buck up &amp; you hear their singing in the dug outs which is a good sign.</p>
