<p>has little hope for him but is going to give him a fighting chance.</p>
<p>May  20<br/>I am glad to say I have got my two patients up on deck; the atmosphere down here is simply frightful and everything filthy.<br/>One of my cases is a man called Dench, he has been shot in the head and is both deaf and dumb.</p>
<p>May  21<br/>In the cabin next to where are my two patients is a wounded Turk shot in the lungs &ndash; it is truly heart-breaking to see him gasping out his life and unable to do anything for him.</p>
<p>May 22<br/>On deck 6.30 a.m.  Patients are lying here just as they were when they left the trenches, with all the filthy and blood-soaked clothes still upon them. I must get them washed somehow, so I get the orderlies, who don't seem to have thought this was necessary, to discover all the basins they can and get to work washing the patients.</p>
<p>I take one of my patients, Miller, to the operating theatre and help with the operation.  Dr Fiaski Jun. is the M.O. in charge. I nearly faint through weakness and dread shaking the surgeon's hand while he is operating on this very dangerous case.<br/>Dr Fiaski tells me that if this operation was being performed in a London Hospital , it would have been considered truly marvellous.'</p>
<p>Dench is now able to walk but is heart broken at losing</p>
