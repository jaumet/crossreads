<p>Extract from a letter dated 15.8.16, written by Arnold R Treacher No. 2301 B. Company 20th Battalion, written to Ms S. D. McIntyre</p>
<p>"During those few weeks at Etaples news reached us that our company commander Captain Ferguson &ndash; who is I believe, a son of Judge Ferguson of Sydney &ndash; had been killed.  A cool, calm, fearless man, he, and as such we respected him. But a truer, whiter man we never met &ndash; his advice, his cheerfulness, his fearlessness, and his efforts to help us, we will never forget neither today, nor tomorrow, <strike>ever</strike> nor yet any of the days we may spend where pluck, kindness and ability count for anything.</p>
