<p>Saripi Rest Camp<br/>West Mudros. Lemnos<br/>Sunday 3rd October 1915</p>
<p>My dear Mother,<br/>Am still "recuperating" here but expect to leave for the Peninsula about Tuesday of Wednesday. Although I feeling quite OK when we came away I think the change has been no harm as of course there is a certain amount of strain while one is actually on the job, and it is very nice to get right away and forget it for a while.<br/>I will be glad to get back to get my letters as it is over a month now since I had your last (25th July). Saw Kenneth last night but he has had no letters from Sydney later than my last.<br/>Things are awfully quiet here &ndash; we are across the Harbour from the Main Landing where the British and French troops are camped and don't hear much of what is going on, though I<br/>I</p>
