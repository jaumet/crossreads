 every day there are rumours that we are off in a week.  Everyone seems to have a friend in a high office who told them something in its utmost secrecy.  We have formed a little band of our own which is made up mostly of the Surfing men and I think we will get on very well together.  There are Tom, George, Steve and Rob also Hal and myself. Hal is still in good form but the exercise does not seem to take away any of the adipose tissue. I made another friend today, an Irishman called Gillan, I think we will be great pals, he is very witty and has a fund of stories. Now I must close as I'm mess orderly today and have to scrub the dixies and fed the lions.
