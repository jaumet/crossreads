  
 we do slide off, the Pilot will have to beach her again to prevent her from sinking. There is some 7 or 8 feet of water below now in the holds. From the foc'sle you can plainly see the bottom, there appears only about 7 feet of water there and the coral & fungus us clearly visable. 
 Well Father, I have to do my coal lumping now, so I will stop & will not end this, perhaps I shall have  to  a chance to write more later. 
 You might show this to Arthur Wynne & Capt. Newton, amongst others, I think it would interest them, & tell Mother not to be alarmed, I guess I will crawl out alright as usual. 
 4 am Friday 
 Have done our shift of coat lumping - in fact 2 shifts since I left off. Started at 8 pm & went like mad till 9 pm, and again from 2 am till 3 am. It was hardly worth while going to bed for the few hours
