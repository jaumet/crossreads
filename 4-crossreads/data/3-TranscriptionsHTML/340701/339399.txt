<p>Sunday 23-7-16<br/>This Etaples is as dirty as Boulogne  men urinate anywhere at all.  There is apparently no drainage system, streets narrow paved with cobbles tortuous Houses old, often askew &amp; all kinds of Architecture.  Attended Church parade there today at an old Norman Church built by the British in 1432.  I heard that the trenches at Armentierres are very shallow and practically all parapet.  Because the water lies so near the surface.  The gas used by the Germans poisons exposed food and cigarettes also.  It also colours metal facings &amp; I notice that the wearers <u>don't</u> take pains to remove the discolouration.  When the miners Battalion arrived in the Trenches the Germans put up a sign saying "Miners you have got 2 months to live".  The french often plough up to within 1000 yds of the Trenches.</p>
