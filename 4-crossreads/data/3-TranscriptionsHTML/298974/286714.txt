<p>6<br/>For two days we were quarantined so we had no leave. Then we got 4 days. Of course we all made off immediately for London. They paid us the measly sum of &pound;4 to 'do' London on. But we had one free ticket to take us anywhere &amp; back on the British Isles, and as many half fare ones as we wanted. I got my free one to Cambridge via London, so needed no others.</p>
