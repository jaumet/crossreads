The place was full of soldiers, mostly Austn., going up to take over part of the line. Just E of the town is a long sloping hill known as Tara Hill, at the foot of which we stopped again &amp; got our travelling kitchens up to give the boys a cup of tea. All round were batteries of heavy guns which gave one some idea of the artillery support to be expected by the infantry up in the front line. From time to time as we waited in the dusk by the road-side parties if tommies came swinging in to Albert many carrying German helmets, caps &amp; other trophies presumably found in the dug-outs while on fatigue work. It was somehow a cheering sight for they were all in such good spirits. Soon it was dark &amp; we pushed on in small parties, each with a guide who lead us up the hill &amp; away along its forward slope down Sausage Valley to a place named Gordon Dump.</p>
