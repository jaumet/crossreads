<p>with the driver pulling his leg on some long yarns &amp; Palliser was quietly blissful. The beauty of the lakes is beyond description  Glorious, and we pass right around those lakes  Beautiful, I can't find words to express it. A comfortable bed &amp; the fresh air is great &amp; sleep like a tip.</p>
<p>28th July:- Friday<br/>My cold is rather bad this morning &amp; stay in bed until 10-30 am after a good hot lemon &amp; whisky last night  The servant looks after me well. Legge Chant &amp; Palliser have gone for a long drive, right around the lakes    &amp; back 14 miles by boat. Left at 7 am but I decide to wait for the sun on account  of my cold. Write a few letters etc, a long talk with the proprietor, all about Killarney &amp; I set forth alone at 12 noon for further views. First the Cathedral a beautiful building, then to the Mansion, Earl of Kenmare's late residence, partly destroyed by fire. A little boy, very talkative, from the lodge, accompanies me to the fine old house, still standing, of 360 rooms.  The fine grounds, so well laid out, command a beautiful view of the <strike>upper</strike> lower &amp; middle lake. The gardens &amp; outhouses are still nicely kept</p>
