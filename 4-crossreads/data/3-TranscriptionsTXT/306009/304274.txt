 1915 Mar. 29 Mon. We had a meeting of the A.S.A. to-night &amp; as there was a concert on in the Y.M.C.A. - the meeting was adjourned to the open out on the sand. Beautiful  moonlight night &amp; everything so silent &amp; still!  Went for a walk after meeting over to Sphinx with Fred. King of Field Artillery &ndash; What a decent chap he is. The Nurses are having a good time, rather &ndash; especially with the officers. Two &amp; two.
