Further news of the air raid came to hand yesterday night, they bombed 3 aeroplane hangers, 2 of which had each 3 planes in 1 had two, they dropped in all 100 bombs of various sizes made splendid work, we lost one plane, it fell into the sea but later both plane occupants were rescued by the navy. It is said now that it is impossible for the Taubes to establish a base (aeroplane) within 100 mls of the canal as they lay themselves too open for attack from our people. Left Ismailia for Romani today at 10, eventually arrived home at 9.30 to find parcels letters awaiting me. Amar has been relieved sent back to his unit for inefficiency.
