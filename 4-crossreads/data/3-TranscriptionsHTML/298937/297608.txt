<p>This Canteen is a great credit to the four or so ladies who run it.<br/>It appears that a great number of N.Z. ladies volunteered for <strike>cate</strike> canteen duties.<br/>The headquarters so to speak &amp; by far the best of canteens run by them under the Y.M.C.A. is in Esbekieh Gardens.<br/>Here is a large marquee tent affair where one can get tea, cake, sandwiches or lemonade, &amp; here in this heat &amp; godforsaken place the ladies love to do good for the soldiers.</p>
