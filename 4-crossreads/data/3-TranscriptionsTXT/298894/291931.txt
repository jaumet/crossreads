were late in arriving. We were deadbeat by 10AM the time the Pinnace was to call for us but as usual it arrived about 2 hours late. We arrived on the "Ascania" a Cunard 15000 liner about 1.30PM & were shortly after served up with a first class dinner of sausages much to our satisfaction but better was to follow. A start was made immediately to pull down the bunks to allow for taking on wounded. In the evening the crew treated us to a concert & we retired to rest convinced we had reached the last word in troopships. Where our ultimate destination is we know not but suspect some new landing to take place.
Wednesday 2nd June.
Reveille 5.30, Bread butter jam & coffee 5.45 absolute luxury. Then we worked to 8.15 pulling down fittings etc with the thought of a good breakfast before us which materialized in Porridge & sausages. I was then chosen for a boat party & returned to a dinner of Pea Soup & Roast Pork & again for tea Hariot mutton with the usual "fill ups" bread etc. We think it too good to last. Quite the best in our experience of this campaign. The ship has not had on Australians before & all seem bent on giving us a good time. While out in the morning we called on the "Aragon" & found a small mail the first for 2 months but had no luck myself. The ship contains Headquarters staff & 'tis a busy scene all day. Steam launches go to & fro with dispatches & orders. Ships boats jostle with one another for a position
