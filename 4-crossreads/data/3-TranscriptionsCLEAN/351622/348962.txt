[indecipherable]The ground is also hard as can beWith an old waterproofThat does for a roofAnd the flees always tormentingThen the Turks throwing bombs all aroundNo worse place on earth could be foundThere are fleas, there are liceI shall always think twiceOf returning to GallipoliThe cooks of the 5th A.M.C.They manage to spoil even teaTheir stew and their riceYou would hardly call niceIn fact they are no good to meTheir [wood] & their water we [draw]Besides a great many thing moreThey live on the bestAnd we get the restWhile campaigning in Gallipoli
