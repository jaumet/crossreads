<p>1917 Tuesday 27 Feb.</p>
<p>On duty per usual. <br/>News came today that poor old Ridgway's brother Jack was killed yesterday.<br/>Ridg. himself came down from the line later.  He's very much broken up besides being unwell. This cursed killing &amp; maiming of good men is damnable, but such is the cost of victory as we really are making great progress.<br/>Got some Australian mail today after a month's famine. <br/>Letters from Ethel Mac.
