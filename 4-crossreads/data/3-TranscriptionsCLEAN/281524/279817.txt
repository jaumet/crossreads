  
 1/10/17 Just at dusk a heavy strafe started which I think must have been German as we are not commencing until 8.15 pm. I was glad at having held the Battalion up until conditions settled down well. At dusk all the men got outside piled arms and waited for the word to commence moving. Today has been very busy with issue of orders, arrangement of details etc. and our work has not yet commenced until we march up to the line. I would not be surprised if Fritz had come over at dusk tonight. The march up to the line was uneventful except that by taking a wrong turning we went round in a circle and had much extra walking. All the chaps laden up to the teeth plenty of pack and other transport about. Fortunately it was bright moonlight and at last our wanderings landed us at Kit and Kat where water and machine gun magazines were picked up. Reached a pillbox in Hannebeke wood not having a shell near us. It had been an old artillery position
