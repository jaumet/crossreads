<p>II<br/>when he visited us a few weeks back, we are holding up a large Turkish Army here which otherwise would be employed against the Allies in some other part, and I suppose we must be content with this.<br/>Had a long letter from Sis this last week. She seems in good heart and is pleased with all her surroundings still one can see there is a little touch of home longing underneath it all.<br/>Absolutely nothing taking place here &ndash; we have a hostile airman over about once every four days on an average and bang away at him, but they don't like our shrapnel and nearly always clear off pretty soon.<br/>A very pretty bombardment took place yesterday afternoon (sounds like a wedding doesn't it?) by the Navy. A Turkish battery on our right flank known as the "Beachy Bill" battery (owing to his shelling the beach almost daily) had been giving a fair amount of trouble, so yesterday the ships on duty here, 2 monitors and 2 cruisers, lined up and let him have it. The reports &amp; shrieks of the shells were almost deafening, the ships letting go broadsides of 7 at a time, and the explosions as the shells struck were terrific, great forks of flame shooting up in the air. They fired about 800 rounds in all and it was about the prettiest bit of naval shooting we have seen here of late.</p>
