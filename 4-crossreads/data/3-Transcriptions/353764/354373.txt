<p>Blue Mosque &amp; Saw Service being conducted according to the Koran religion.  This is noted for its Marvellous Tile-work, the whole interior being lined with tiles which cost fabulous prices &amp; are all a pale blue worked out in various designs.  We then visited another Mosque which Napoleon bombarded &amp; saw the wonderful Golden Gates.  These gates are about 100 ft high &amp; 40 ft wide &amp; are studded with Gold, Silver &amp; bronze.  When Napoleon took the town [?] he had one sent to Paris &amp; it is now in the French Museum.  Each gate is worth roughly &pound;400000 &amp; guarded by men &amp; enclosed within Steel Bars.  These guard the Sultans tomb.<br/>Every Mosque in Egypt is built over a Tomb of an ex Sultan.</p>
<p>I then came over to Heliopolis &amp; met Cpl C R Palmer &amp; visited Gezirich Island where the Zoo is situated,  had Afternoon Tea &amp; went to Ezbekieh Gardens.  We then went to Church [?] in Kasr-el-Nil &amp; finally returned to camp after a heavy but interesting day</p>
