<p>9 Thursday<br/>This isn't a very big village.  It was a fine day to day I can tell you we all appreciated the warm sun.  Saw Clive Dwyer in the evening.  We didn't do anything all day, so I wrote four letters in the afternoon.  The Huts we are in are light structures with tarpaulins thrown over they.  We are expecting to be here for a few day.  Saw Dan Dignian [?] &amp; Tom Turnbull in the 13th Btn.</p>
<p>10 Friday<br/>It was very misty until about 10 oclock this morning.  This evening I can hear a rather a heavy  bombardment on our left.  Went for a route march about a couple of miles out on to the top of a big hill where a splendid view of the surrounding district can be obtained, There was a very heavy bombardment all night no news though.  A German Airoplane bombed the Div. Rest station.</p>
<p>11 Saturday<br/>There were 12 casualties.<br/>The bombardment is still continuing.  The 4th Fld Amb played the 4th Machine gun Coy League foot ball this morning, scores M.G. Coy 6, 4th Fld 3. &amp; we again played the Royal Engineers in the afternoon (socker) scores R.Es 3 to nil.  Saw Jim Lihou  &amp; Bob Stewart in the evening.  The days are very misty &amp; cold now.</p>
<p>12 Sunday<br/>There was a very exciting game of socker between the 4th Machine gun Coy &amp; the Royal Engeers  Score M.G. Coy 1 to nil.  The bombardment reached a <u>very</u> high standard during the night</p>
