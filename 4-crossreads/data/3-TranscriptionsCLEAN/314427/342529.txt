 Sunday April 6.1919   147 [Shorthand transcribed as follows]  6 day on the voyage.  [end of shorthand]  The sea is calm the sun is shining out warm but the sky is cloudy. Rain fell after dinner. There was a church parade at 11 a.m. on the top deck. It  was poorely attended. A number of gambling schools in various parts of the ship was much better attended. Two-up, Even and over Sevens, and numbers were the chief games played. These two latter games are played with dice, and are similar to crown & anchor, which has been prohibited on board. Numerous card games below deck were also in full swing. As a result of these various games some of the men are penniless and a few much richer. The trouble is all cannot be winners. 
 We were told at breakfast that during the 24 hours ending yesterday the ship made 328 miles, which announcement was received with cheers. 
 [Shorthand transcribed as follows]  I returned the "Treasure [?] Magazine" to the Red Cross this morning and received the "Wide World Magazine" for January this year.  [end of shorthand]
