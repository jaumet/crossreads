 1st Field Amb Tek-el-Keber 16 Jan 16 After reading end, see  page 5  My dear Irene, Just received two letters from you which was very nice. Thank you very much for letting people know my new address. I am sure any letters addressed to me Cp. Ghezirch will be delivered. Thank goodness I am not on the Richmond just now. None of your presents have come to hand yet, but they will no doubt soon. Went &amp; had a look at the Cemetery here today, Sunday. One saw there the names of many heroes.
