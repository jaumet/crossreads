28th June 1916 
Raining in morning but cleared up late in afternoon. Mess orderly for day. Our ship again up with the other troopers. Very likely to call at Dakar, French Senegal tomorrow.
29th June 1916 
Arrived Dakar at 10 oclock am after sighting land at 8 oclock. Beautiful day. First impression somewhat fair as regards scenery, although country is very low lying barren. Our ship was the first to enter the harbour. Harbour is only a basin about a square mile or so with a low breakwater all round. Seems to be plenty of fish in this quarter. Niggers selling fish diving for coins was the stunt all day. All residences at this port are built on the square very low I suppose on account of the heat. Government house stands facing the sea, a very nice compact looking building. We were not granted any leave so cannot say anything about general appearance of town. "Marathon" came up into port in the afternoon we dropped anchor outside at 5 oclock pm. Beltana Benalla also went into port. We took a load of fresh water aboard also shipped mounted a 4.7 gun. Town looks pretty outside the harbour especially as we saw it tonight. We are at present near the Battleship "Swiftsure" which we hear is to escort us to England. In port is the French warship "Montcalm". Anyhow so much for French Senegal
