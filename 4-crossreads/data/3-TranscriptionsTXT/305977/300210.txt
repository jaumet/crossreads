Went out to Abbassia Barracks to see if I could find a Cousin Douglas Moncrieff's friend but he had gone the week before, so came on to Heliopolis to see to the Austn wounded.  They all seemed very cheerful.  I stayed there yarning till after 6.  Saw Harry Fitzgerald in town at night.  We believed him dead so it was a great surprise.  Got the 10.30pm train back home.
