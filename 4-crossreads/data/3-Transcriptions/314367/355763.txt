<p>In looking back I see I made no mention of a 6 mile walk yesterday (Friday) &ndash; on my own &ndash; thro the bush &ndash; across a neck of land &ndash; I  started at 2 &amp; got back at 6 &amp; had a swim in addition &ndash; I got a maiden hair fern &amp; also a golden fern both new to me here &ndash; Coming back I met the Administrator in his car &amp; he offered me a lift &ndash; I declined for I wanted  the walk &amp; I wanted to see the plant &amp; native life &ndash; This was my last time ashore in Rabaul &amp; I was &amp; am very content &ndash; I know Rabaul fairly well &ndash;</p>
<p>Sunday Feb 14-15   Saty night was a beaut &ndash; hot &ndash; damp &ndash; we darkened ship &ndash; I slept on the poop deck &amp; had to shift in the night for the rain &ndash; you break your feet up in the dark &ndash; I put in the morning at sick parade &amp; then at the accounts &ndash; I'm glad to say we are on the safe side &ndash; completely &ndash; thanks to our sales in Rabaul &ndash; Our ice is done &ndash; Beer but 14 bottles left &ndash; Fresh meat leaves us to-day &ndash; a week of low diet &ndash; The cider seems to me to have soda Salycilate or Boracic Acid in it &ndash; I seems to depress a little &ndash; so we &ndash; who know &ndash; are selling it &ndash; Its a good drink but one doesnt want too much of it &ndash; The sea is calm but its hot &ndash; I've <u>nothing</u> on but a singlet &amp; am just nice &ndash; at least nice &amp; cool -</p>
