<p>August 31st Monday<br/>Still in the same place. Our fleet has however increased. Th "Aurange" (?) arrived this morning from Sydney with stores &amp; medals. We went ashore again for musketry &amp; sat all day under a weeping forest. Returning we saw indications that the journey was to be resumed. Great joy on board.</p>
<p>September 1st Tuesday<br/>Despite above stated indications of a continuation of our voyage, we are still here. Early this morning the lighter "Bobbie Towns" came alongside with stores from Townsville. A party of "H" company ("H" every time) spent all the morning removing the dead. We stacked 70000 lbs of best Queensland beef in the refrigerator &amp; received our rum allowance.</p>
<p>The lighter brought newspapers &ndash; the Townsville Daily &amp; ;the Nth Queensland Register &ndash; aboard. Rags of the first water though they are they were more welcome than "Truth" on a wet Sunday. We may sail tonight.  There is a prayer meeting in progress on deck to ask the almighty to instil into the Brigadier's heart the desire to advance.<br/>Posted two letters</p>
