4/9/15 burrowed with dugouts and with rough huts running down to waters edge. We were under fire nearly all the journey but most of the bullets were high although an occasional one whizzing past the ears made everyone duck. Guides met us at wharf and conducted us along beach up gullies to a position behind the trenches. A terrible journey with the packs on reaching the destination all just sank down and slept. The rattle of rifle fire going all the time and every few minutes a big boom and subsequent explosion as they shelled the other trenches. The illuminating shells very pretty and lighting up the whole position. The whole country most difficult after the first precipitous sand scrub rise the country goes back in very rough hills like those about Frankston.
5/9/15
All night the firing continuous but at the hour before daybreak the fusillade was enormous. All the artillery available rifles were brought to bear and the noise was indescribable. At present breakfast time hostilities seem adjourned until after the meal and all is peaceful. The men are lying in terraces right up the hillside.
