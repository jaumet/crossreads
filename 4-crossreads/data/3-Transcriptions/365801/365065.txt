<p>and I can only profer [sic]sympathy in words.  If only all that I feel could be written for you to see!  I loved him.  He &amp; I have been bound in special ties of friendship for many years now.  He was a brave soldier, an honourable and upright gentleman and a true friend.  The whole battalion mourns his loss.  Please convey my very deep sympathy to Mrs Ferguson and Dorothy for them in this their great loss, and be sure, Sir, that anything I can do at all, will be a labour of love.<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/>Walter P. MacCallum.</p>
