December 27, 28Two letters written and posted:  to Aunt Louie & asking for Moore's "Story Teller's Holiday" and to Mrs. H. my thanks for the book parcel.
Commenced, and half completed, a drawing of the Solre Hotel de Ville and Tower, for "Aussy".
December 2812.A mood of blasphemous fed-upness:  Mick was to have been paraded by Morell to the G.O.C. at 12.30:  instead he refuses the parade, threatens all the Military's wrath, and sends to the draft in Mick's place, Kerr's batman!  Indispensable:  in face of General Monash's Corps order that no man is indispensable - in the face of G.S.O. [General Staff Officer] III, Capt. Laughlin - leaving for Aust. H.Q. in the middle of a stunt in September, from the Bois de Buire!
Who is Morell - C.C. Boyd? - and his brother, C. Morell of the Pioneers late 1917 becomes a Staff Trainee.
Thank God the warr is over!
Out alone this afternoon in the blowing rain along the drear dirty roads.
13.A Dream of a great sombre Tapestry hung hall, strangely entered from the porchway of a poor villiage church:  in the small graveyard about were broken flung down vaults as at St. Souplet.
