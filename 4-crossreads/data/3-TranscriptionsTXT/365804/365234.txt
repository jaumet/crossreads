Dear Judge FergusonIn making enquiries about Lieutenant A. Campling of the 20th Battalion, we have just received the following report from the Red Cross in London and thought you would like to see it.
"Lieutenant Campling and some other officers were having a smoke together after lunch in the dining dug-out in the trenches at Bois Grenier. They left this dug-out and went to another. Just as they reached it a shell struck the top, passed in and exploded. Captain Ferguson  was killed and Campling was so badly wounded that he died half an hour later, just as he was being taken into the Dressing Station. Witness was present at his burial which took place in the cemetery at Bois Grenier. The bodies of Captain Ferguson and Campling were buried together. Two crosses mark the grave the surface of which is covered with white rubble in which is worked a red cross.
Yours FaithfullyHarry M Stephen
