<p>had arrived.<br/>I told you of course that the cash exactly panned out to the tick and I sent the &amp;pound;3 to Fred which he got alright in Cairo.<br/>As I don't inhabit Taxis I thought it much better that Fred should have that part also since Sam is on the Headquarters Staff he is not in such violent need of salted almonds as he was last year.<br/>Haven't seen the Elsmies for quite 2 months.<br/>Annette came in to our Flat to Tea one day and Mum &amp; I lunched there another day the 1st week in May.
