 for the British Army. Great sorrow in the force. Cloudy and a little rain this morning. Things quiet. Our trenches were flattened out by the enemy yesterday. Although we say trenches, they are actually parapits. Can't dig trenches here, strike water. So to get sufficient cover, embankments are erected. All telephones cut off from 10 A.M. til 3 P.M. We are listening, and finding out if our lines are tapped by the enemy 9-6-16 A very wet and windy night. But fine today. All civilian population ordered 6 miles behind the firing line 10-6-1916 Wet cold and miserable. Aeroplanes busy. A big stunt on over Ypres way. Our front fairely quiet. Although we fire over 100 rounds per day. About 200 rounds fired at Hun plane, good shooting, the last 3 shots one over, one under, and the last a direct hit. The machine burst into flames and dived to earth.
