Returning to town again I picked him up at 6.30 & had dinner at the hotel on Charing Cross Station after which we went to Shaftsbury Theatre to see Yes, Uncle, a very amusing play which I enjoyed immensely.  He having to meet a friend, we parted but I spent half an hour watching the crowd at Piccadilly before entering the tube for home, when in the lift at the other end I met not only Ramsay again with his friend but V. Hutton who was our W.O. for a couple of years in Egypt & France.  We went along to my hotel & had a yarn over coffee & will see him again today.  Altogether a very good day & am still wondering at my good fortune in meeting the three old friends still here I wished most to meet, practically all the others having gone to Australia.
