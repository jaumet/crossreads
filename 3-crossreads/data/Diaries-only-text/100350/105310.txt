[August 1915]
22nd Turks try to drive us out of newly won "possy" but fail, we were reinforced by 100 men before daylight the ground we charged over littered with our dead and many wounded. Warships and Howitzers again bombard enemy trenches this afternoon, expecting to make another attack this evening, hope we have better success. Major Herring reported our Battln to weak to make assault, we numbered only 160 men. Remained on defensive all night.
23rd Turks made attack on our position at 2.A.M. this morning, but met with a very warm reception and were obliged to retire, at daylight there were many dead Turks lying in front of our Trenches. We were relieved by 2 Coys of the 16th Battln at 8.A.M. this morning, and after working our way back, at times on hands knees through prickly scrub and stonking bodies of Turks we reached our Bivouac about 400 yards in rear of fireing line. After haveing a good fill of Beef Biscuits we curled up for a much needed sleep.
