<p>Monday 26th<br/>Joe Woods got wounded in the leg with shrapnel.  Over 30 men in B Squadron out of 90 paraded to the doctor this morning &amp; he said the Regt would soon have to have a spell as the men were worn &amp; tired after so much hard work.  Did not go on afternoon shift.  We were allowed 12 hrs off after inoculation which was 2 days ago.  There was a lot of artillery fire after 6 oclock both high explosive shrapnel.</p>
