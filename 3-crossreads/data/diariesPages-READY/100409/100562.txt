took us to a lodging further along 36th St ? the district being called the Tenderloin. 
Then went for walk down Broadway a few blocks and then saw about an Australian Reception Committee, so went to their Office at 200 Fifth Avenue, near the Flatiron Building. The place is run by the Order of the Daughters of the British Empire. They are getting us in touch with some Australians resident in New York. 
Then walked right down Broadway to Wall St and went down Wall St into Broad St to the Stock Exchange and saw them bidding on the curb market. A Yank came up and told us he would give us a fly around in a motor, but we waited some time and he did not come so we went off.
Came back to near Broadway and took the Subway to 23rd St and went to Childs Restaurant for lunch, having Sausages and Buckwheat cakes for 55 cents. Then went back to Com'tee room for short time and met another Aussie from the Dental Corps. We went with him to a Salvation Army place in 41st St to try to get a decent bed but they were full up. 
Then went back to Com'tee room again, on the way calling in at a War Committee Hut and having afternoon tea. The American ladies there were very nice and seemed to take a great interest in us. Then went by Broadway tram to 75th St to another Salvation place and there got fixed up with a bed; on way after leaving tram had to go through Central Park, but could not see
