<p>Have been playing bridge nearly all night  it is now 12.30  we left off to attend the funeral &amp; then started again, so you can see we have spent a pretty quiet Xmas Eve.</p>
<p>25th. Xmas Day &amp; the second I have spent on the ocean &amp; 5th since leaving Australia  2 in France 1 in Egypt &amp; 2 on the sea, this one is easily the happiest for the war is over &amp; the world is now resuming its former quiet occupation &amp; giving up cutting each others throats,  I slept on deck as usual &amp; rose or rather was pulled out by Penfold about 6.30 who was wishing all &amp; sundry a Merry Xmas &amp; etc, folded up my blankets &amp; rolled them into the hammock then down stairs to sling them in the bin &amp; there for a wash to get the grime off for sleeping on deck though cool &amp; nice</p>
