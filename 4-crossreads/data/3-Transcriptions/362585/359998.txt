<p>France<br/>6.3.17</p>
<p>My dear Mrs. Ferguson,</p>
<p>Just received a parcel containing 2 pairs of socks and this addressed envelope.  Thank you very much.</p>
<p>I am in splendid health and condition and have had quite a good time lately.  I have been jumping about from C.O. to second in command &amp; back again ever since I came back.  At present I am second in command.  I have not got any promotion yet but it may be along any minute now.</p>
<p>The ground is again very sloppy.  We had a lot of snow a couple of days ago followed by a quick thaw and the place is in a lovely state.</p>
<p>Rations have been splendid and Canteen delicacies fairly easily obtainable.</p>
<p>Parcels have been coming along in close column of platoons (you'll have to get someone to tell you what that means) and altogether I am feeling quite optimistic and cheerful.  I think our side is winning.  Fritz is having a Rotten time here.</p>
<p>Best love, yours <strike>sincerely</strike> affectionately C.R.Lucas</p>
