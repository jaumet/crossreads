<p>and desolation spread whenever fighting has occurred is something for one to remember. I was in a farm across the road today, it had been turned into a little fortress, loopholes made all round the brick walls and sandbagged up, everything in the furniture line and farm machinery more or less smashed up and slung into the courtyard, a grievous sight altogether.</p>
<p>Thank goodness we missed the Winter, the conditions here then must have been just appalling, by the look of old camps and fields or any place where men had been moving. Although we have had a little rain, the ground is fast drying, the green grass and budding trees I watch every day, its a great country monotonous after a while, everlasting fields bounded by hedges and lines of straight growing trees planted in a dead line, I dont know what they are, am told the owners are not allowed to cut them until the trees reach a certain age and another must be grown to replace it. Of course the Military cut and destroy anything just as it suits them.</p>
<p>I often wonder what the poor devils of people will do when they return at last to their homes, it will take many years to bring them back to normal again, of course the farms interest me most, at every chance I go poking around examining their internal arrangements all the cattle are housed during the winter</p>
