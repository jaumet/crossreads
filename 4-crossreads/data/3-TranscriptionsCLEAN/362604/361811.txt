  
 the Firm per Mr. Eric.  I shall reply as soon as possible.  I spent last Thursday afternoon at a place along the front called Nice-Havrais.  I climbed up a zig-zag path about 500 feet & had a general panoramic view of Havre.  The sea was pretty rough & the numerous small craft in the Bay were tossing about like corks.  I spent the evening at the Y.M.C.A. with Ellis at a Band Concert.   On the 13th  Ellis & I moved out of the hut which we occupied with our two Sergeants into one by ourselves.  It is ever so much better fitted & more comfortable & we are alone which is a God Send.  We are as happy as can be now.  The old number you see how it still follows us about. 
 Well, my Dear ones, I have very little news.  We are both well & if you have not seen Mrs. Thomas, don't tell Her that Ernie was ill.  He is quite O.K. again.  We are sent to Hospital with the slightest sickness here. 
 Best Love to you all, Harry.
