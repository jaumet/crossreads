heart burn with indignation at the "fons et origo mali", [the source and origin of evil] to us it is incentive enough to steel our determination to win through & punish those who have wantonly caused all this suffering & destruction, how much more so must it be to the French people who have had to bear the brunt of it all.  The room here in which we have our mess was probably (at least I imagine it was) M'selles boudoir & charming it no doubt was with its dainty curtains & delicate finery so dear to the feminine, a charming alcove for a cushioned recess, the mirrors now gone or broken mostly would have belonged to none but a woman.  The whole place is in keeping, drawing room, dining & all were once papered & no doubt furnished in most excellent taste if one can judge by the remains, the orchard & garden with "un foret" & lake would have been in season a most delicious spot.  Why wasn't I hear 5 or 6 yrs. ago.
