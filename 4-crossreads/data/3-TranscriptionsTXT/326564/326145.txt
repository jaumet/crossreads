So I reckoned I did not do too badThe French people must have thought us bad, they were all out to see us pass through the villages, it was funny to see the mob rolling home dead beat & done to the world & we were all in the same boat, after I cooled down I went and had a cold bath, & then after tea there was a lecture on aerial photography, after this was over I walked down to Merckenghem to see about my watches if they were done or not, here I struck Fatty Gill & had a bit of a yarn with him, then I walked home in the moonlight.
21st. Lovely weather again & thing are looking beautiful. Last night old Fritzs planes were over bombing & all our lights were put out
