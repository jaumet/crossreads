 It is wonderful here to see the organisation of the army; we only see an infinitesimal part of the whole show, but even that part is so large and complicated that one's mind cannot imagine the whole show in its entirety &ndash; its tremendous. Rations, Guns, Stores, railways, hospitals, everything running steadily and smoothly with one end in view &ndash; to help the poor downtrodden infantry. 
 The big guns are wonderful and it is the sight of the lifetime to see them in action and to see how methodically they work. One also becomes very soon accustomed to see dozens of aeroplanes in the air at a time. So far I have not seen an aerial duel, though I have looked very anxiously for the sight of one. It is wonderful to see the planes sailing steadily along in the blue sky, and then suddenly see them ringed around with black or white smoke, denoting the activity of the "Archies" (anti-aircraft guns) of both sides. Some of the stunts that the planes do in the course of their ordinary days work makes one's hair stand on end. They beat anything that Guillaux or Hawker ever did in Australia.  Their control is marvellous. You see the planes suddenly dip towards the earth, apparently out of control and drop down like a stone to within a few hundred feet of the ground &ndash; then just when you think its all up, they straighten up and sail off as if nothing had happened. Frequently they shut off their engines and drop just like a bird shot on the wing, tumbling over and over, and then, without effort pick up again and go off in a new direction &ndash; its really some stunt. 
 The men over here are keeping up wonderfully well and our crowd lately have added lustre to the great name they have already won;- the "dinkums" are admittedly the hardest working, hardest fighting, in the whole army of Australians. All ranks are looking forward, however, to that happy time when peace shall be declared and they may return to Australia. One thing that this war has revealed is the Australian's love of his country &ndash; his own country I mean, not England. You may speak of a Frenchman or German being patriotic, but they are not in it  with an Australian. Every man here is simply dying to get back to Australia; it is their continual theme of conversation and it fills their letters (which we have to censor). They have seen England, France and Egypt, but all agree that our own country can give them all a start and beat them easily, and I believe myself &ndash; I have not seen much anywhere over here that is better than the same thing at Home.  And the people here are too dopy &ndash; I think tradition is too heavy upon them and they simply settle into the ways of their ancestor without question or without making an effort towards progress. 
 We are now well over the middle of Winter; and February, the dreaded month, passed fairly comfortably and now we are well on towards April, so I think the worst is over. I am now living well within my 7/- per day, and find that I can save quite a deal which will be very handy later on. 
 Hoping you are well and everyone else at Home, 
 Yours with love, Bert.
