  
 Wed. Mar/12. The weather is quite mild today & the sea is fairly calm. We received the 10/- prize today for having the best kept Hospital. Cowell, Kelly, Postill & I played a hand at Poker, as it wasn't  worth while splitting up the 10 bob. Cowell had a pair of Jacks, & I drew a pair of Kings, & so won. We also raffled the water colour that Gribble painted, & a chap named Nash won it with 10/-. After Tea there was a Boxing Tournament, which was most amusing & passed a couple of hours away quite pleasantly. We expect to arrive at Fremantle on Friday morning, so these W.A's only have another day to spend on the Boat. Thur. Mar.13 The W.A.'s are all polishing up their Gear today & preparing for the great event of going ashore & Home. Kirkbride & Cunningham are the only two on Ship's Staff. We are getting along at a fair rate so we ought to arrive at Fremantle early tomorrow morning. I wrote a few lines to B.E., but couldn't say much, as I don't know when we are likely to be Home. Also wrote out a couple of wires, one for Lill & one for Mother so that Kirkbride can take it ashore with him tomorrow. Gilbert, Lakin, Cowell & I played a Game of Cribbage which passed away a very pleasant Hour. We only have four patients in Hospital now, so things are quiet. It is a Lazy Life, & we shall feel it when we have to start work again.
