Police here all carry a useless bayonet & even on hot days a cape overcoat. In Paris itself many of the roads are rough cobble instead of wooden blocks & makes omnibus travelling very uncomfortable.
I have lately commenced to eat horseflesh & like it better than beef. I commenced with a fillet of steak both at same time - one bite of horse & one of bullock & I prefer horse It is tenderer & much cheaper.
Prices here are exhorbitant. A Commission has just been formed which regulate the prices for the week & even so prices are high. Here are the prices of commission for
