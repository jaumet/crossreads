<p>101 Dec 25th<br/>arrival there all hands were rather merry so we did not stay long.</p>
<p>Exceedingly heavy fall of snow tonight &amp; all day today</p>
<p>Tonight word was recd that all officers for Switzerland will leave tomorrow night This news was gladly welcomed &amp; we were so happy that we did not know <strike>how</strike> what to do &ndash; all hands retired fairly early on account of making an early start tomorrow &ndash;</p>
<p>December 26th<br/>All Heavy luggage packed &amp; taken to Drill Hall [indecipherable]. I was one of the first &amp; was successful in having my box &amp; 5 Kit Bags censored by 11.30 am &ndash; I also succeeded in having my letters received in Germany, censored, also other valuable Documents, including my address book autograph book &amp; Photo album &ndash; The search was not a very thorough one. Packed my hand baggage, this afternoon.</p>
<p>Fancy Dress Ball held tonight &ndash; It was a screaming farce Some appearances were really excellent</p>
<p>Played Bridge, &amp; after saying goodbye to my friends we paraded at 11 pm to be personally searched. This was not a very thorough one. We left camp all invalids in a coach, <strike>about midnight</strike> 1 am &amp; eventually entrained after almost freezing &ndash; Gracie, Tremlott Stones &amp; I kept together &ndash;</p>
<p>December 27th<br/>We were taken off the train at some place at 8 am &amp; provided with Breakfast, which was indeed very acceptable.</p>
<p>On arrival at Constance we were taken to some Hotel &amp; there provided with another good meal, the best meals we ever had in Germany, supplied by Germans &ndash; It is typical tho of the Hun to make a great fuss of prisoners on leaving the country, so as to create a very good impression &amp; also to forget <strike>what</strike> the bad treatment we had.</p>
<p>We entrained again at 8 pm &amp; at 10 past 8 crossed the Border &amp; said goodbye to Germany. Such cheers I have never heard before It was impossible for us to realise that we were actually in Switzerland &amp; not in the land that we unfortunately will never forget &ndash; at all the big stations in Switzerland English spoken people greeted us most heartily &amp; provided chocolates cakes cigarettes &amp; Bouquets also coffee</p>
