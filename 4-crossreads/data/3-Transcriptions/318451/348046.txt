<p>Thursday 21st<br/>There has been heavy cannonading all day on our right, continuing till midnight.  I visited the trenches today, went up to the front line of C Coy.  It has been raining today.</p>
<p>Friday 22<br/>Yesterday was the shortest day of the year, the longer days will be very welcome.<br/>I did not go to trenches today but visited the hospital.</p>
<p>Saturday 23<br/>Mr. McCook left this morning for Steenwerck with his battalion.<br/>Cuttriss Chapln. of the 43 came in in McCook's place.  Cutriss has been transferred to the Pioneers.  The Anglicans are insisting on a C of E with every Brigade.  I went out to the trenches today &amp; had lunch at B Coy Hdqtrs.  It was raining again today &amp; the wind was very strong.</p>
<p>Sunday 24th<br/>I was only able to get a very few men for service but we had a nice service &amp;</p>
