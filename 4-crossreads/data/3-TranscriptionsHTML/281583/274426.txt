<p>was a salvoe of shells from the Germans &amp; from what I can see of the place &amp; the direction the shells came from, we are going to be very lucky men if we get out of this place safely.</p>
<p>After getting some water on to boil we looked about for shelter. I eventually found a tent which is not much protection from shells but it was a cover for my head &amp; that suited. Just about this time Fritz put some more over &amp; they were dangerously close. One threw mud all over the tent. The others fell in the vicinity .</p>
<p>We are unfortunately in a very dangerous position being camped just in front of the Rail Head. This as is only natural is a vital stragetic point , &amp; the Germans knowing same are trying very hard to get it. This makes it most unpleasant &amp; I will be sincerely pleased when we get right out of it.</p>
<p>My cold is still troublesome &amp; very irritable at night. I went to bed but not to sleep. The shelling still continued to come over &amp; passing over our heads with the old familiar but sinister hiss made sleep impossible.</p>
<p>At about 4am the guns opened up a heavy bombardment, &amp; seeing that there are some naval guns alongside us, sleep was an impossibility. The firing ceased at dawn and I slept until 9am.</p>
