<p>Thistle Tr<br/>5/1/17 Spent the early hours writing up the log book and doing intelligence. Our snipers and patrols were busy again. Fritz sent a party of about 12 against one of our bombing posts working round to bomb our chaps who fired on them. One man fell and then we got a rifle grenade into them which seemed to cause them some trouble. Only a few of our men were out so had to wait for a while before reconnoitring. On going back to the spot they found no dead or wounded but found a bag full of German bombs which had evidently been dropped by one of them. Otherwise all was correct. Turned in about 6 and slept till 10 after which had breakfast and did odd jobs all the morning. A beautiful sunny morning with plenty of aircraft up and one enemy balloon. Intermittent shelling until after 1.30 when our heavies started a concentrated and intense bombardment on their front line with apparently good results. He put a barrage upon us and my code report to Brigade</p>
