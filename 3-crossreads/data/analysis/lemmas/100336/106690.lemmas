Ear in 1917 the averag traffic was 8 train per day carri munit to the differ fight front . This 12 mile of narrow gage in the mts . has been chang to the broad gaug about six week befor the Armistic was sign . Gerneal speak for the 1st six month Feb.-Juli of this work say up to time of my first attempt escap Augt . 1916 the German Compani treat the prison fair well , becaus food was cheap and the suppli adequ . But when the number of prison increas , food becam scarc and the sick becam more numer . Then condit alter , and we suffer accord , be anim of burden onli . The work on the narrow gage were veri self-contain and complet cement work ; a power station with four machin ; larg air drill etc . When Bulgaria came in against us vast quantiti of materi were easili obtain from Germani through Bulgaria . As the differ batch of Prison came to Belededik they were given job accord to their previous occup as far as possibl , wood-get , load the wagon , navvi , wheel heavi load of stone , tunnel etc . The work was veri hard ; the hour long . 10 per day : pay 1/4 to 2/-, hut onli were suppli . Food had to be purchas out of the pay receiv . When thing got go proper the prison were shift divid into 3 shift so that the work never stop .

Mani prison especi the weak and wound prefer the night shift in the tunnel becaus there were no flea and they escap the intens heat Dure my first stay here some British prison refus to work in the tunnel . They were sent to Bazanti ( Bazardjik ? ) 5 mile away to "hard labour " on the militari road there . It was a punish camp where the work was extrem hard and hour alarm .

I omit to mention that at Belemadjik the Command was a Turkish Naval offic transfer from Apion Kauisshira . He had receiv his naval train under British Admiral and we no doubt profit by this , for he treat us much better than mani other . whilst we were hewer of wood and drawer of water in a foreign land .
