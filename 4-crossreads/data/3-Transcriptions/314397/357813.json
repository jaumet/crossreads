<p>Friday 23.8.18<br/>Fritz came over last night &amp; gave us tons of his eggs. They were very close too. Reported to B.O.R. at 9a.m for the school. The valise &amp; packs went to the station in a limber &amp; the 2 sergeants &amp; I went to Vequemont by lorries. Walked about till the train came in &amp; met tons of officers I knew. Bill Stewart, Tommy Sard, Garnsey, Jenkins &amp; a bit more. Left Vequemont at 2pm &amp; went to Vignacourt. This was small guage. Had to walk from Vignacourt to Pernois (about 4 or 5 Kilo.) Had a cup of tea here &amp; then caught a train</p>
