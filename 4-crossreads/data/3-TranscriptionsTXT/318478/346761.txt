Having referred my informant to the O.C. of the unit of occupation I slept undisturbed save for the old Webley and sticking in my soft parts & a pouch of 36 rounds under my ear.  In fact should you ever visit the scenes of this any second were was I am afraid I could only show you the place where I outdid Aaron & perhaps a small wooden cross, should it still exist, put up outside our possy under a beautiful tree pomegranate I believe & carrying the simple but explanatory epitaph.  In loving memory of the ginger cat that used to live next door.
This afternoon with my tall scout a real scout of the 3rd Brigade I have done a recognaissance of the two places I am to paint & really they are wonderful, one a fording place of the Jordan just below the Lake Baheiret El Herle.  The Lake, hills & Mt. Herman in background.  But enough for tonight.  It is cool & refreshing and so home & dry & more tomorrow.
Yours EverG.W. Lambert.
