 1916 &nbsp; WEDNESDAY 9 &nbsp; AUGUST 
 Fine &amp; hot. Out signalling with the headquarters Staff. We had a couple of L-Corporals from the 43 rd &nbsp;Battallion AIF inspecting us &amp; we got on splendidly with them. We were paid&nbsp;&pound;1 in the evening. An Australian mail (only papers) came in but I did not get any.
