superb. Round Zonnebeke, the battlefield is now a succession of miniature ponds ? pitfalls for the unwary, as they are as treacherous as quicksands. It is a fair hell of a prospect if our fellows or any others have to pass winter in this muck. 
Early morning I visited the "Birdcage" at Hoograaf; where about 600 prisoners are interned from yesterday's battle. Mostly they are mediocre physique, though one notices an occasional fine specimen. They appear right glad to be in our hands, their general opinion is that Germany is done. They expressed great wonderment at our vast artillery resources so they might, for the guns stretch in lines over the country the ground is paved with shells. I took a number of photographs amongst them they willingly submitted; except a brigadier, who turned his back on the camera. I did not press the point out of courtesy.
