  
 arrived there at 7.30 Pm.    I found my two chums at home in my Hut & they had a nice fire going & the hut was very warm.  After having a chat for a while, I went into another hut to see another Pall who was bad with Cramps, I made some Coffee & put all the Rum I had left in it & him & I had a nice hot drink.  After having a chat with him I went back to my hut, where my two chums were having Supper of Toast & Cocoa, so I joined them & had a drop, one of the chaps was on the Shunter at Midnight so I turned into his bed & had a good sleep.   The hut was very warm all night, outside it was freezing.   As my Train left Poperinghe at 9.27  am, I got up at 7.30 am & after having breakfast, I left the Camp at 8.15 am & walked into The Town.   As it was bitterly cold I put on my Balaclava under my Big Hat, to keep my neck & ears warm, the frost gives my ears what Oh.   I arrived in Town at 9. am & went into see my Lady-Friend to have a Cup of Coffee with her.   I found her well & had just came home from Church, she wondered what had become of me as I had not seen her for a month.  I am stationed to far away to get into town very often.   After saying good bye I walked along to the Station where I produced my Movement
