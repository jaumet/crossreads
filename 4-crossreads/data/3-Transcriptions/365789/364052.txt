<p>Extracts from Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, No. 159, of 6th November, 1916: &ndash;</p>
<p>The following reports, received from the official press representative with the Australian Imperial Force, are published for general information.</p>
<p>On the same day on which the British took Guillemont and Leuze Wood, and reached Ginchy, on the same day on which the French pushed their line almost to Combles, at the same time as the British attacked Thiepval from the front, the Australians for the fifth time delivered another blow at the wedge which they have all the while been driving into Thiepval from the back, along the ridge whose crest runs northwards from Pozieres past Mouquet Farm.</p>
<p>It was a very heavy blow this time.  On each occasion the wedge has been driven a little further forward.  This time the blow was heavier, and the wedge went further.</p>
<p>The attack was made just as a summer night was reddening into dawn.  Away to the rear over Guillemont &ndash; for the Australians were pushing almost in an opposite direction from the great British push &ndash; the first light of day glowed angrily on the lower edges of the leaden clouds.  You could faintly distinguish objects a hundred yards away.  Our field guns from behind the hills broke suddenly into a tempest of fire, which tore a curtain of dust from the red shell craters carpeting the ridge.  A few minutes later the bombardment lengthened, and the line of Queenslanders, Tasmanians, and Western Australians rushed for the trenches ahead of them.</p>
<p>On the left, well down the shoulder of the hill towards Thiepval, was the dust-heap of craters and ashes, with odd ends of some shattered timber sticking out of it, which goes by the name of Mouquet Farm.  It was a big, important homestead some months ago.  To-day it is mere wreckage, in a boundless tawny sea of craters.</p>
