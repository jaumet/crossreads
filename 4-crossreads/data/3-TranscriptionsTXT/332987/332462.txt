 with teams complete.  The German drivers bringing them down under escort of cavalry men.  Dead men and horses strewn about all over the fields.  The tanks are doing good work.  I am writing this on what was enemy country only yesterday morning.  I can see smoke rising in Fritzs lines, apparently he is burning his material. 
 11-8-1918 Our advance still going.  Objectives gained, 200 yards.  Terrific artillery fire.  Weather fine, hot.  Hundreds of dead Huns about, and tons of German equipment.  Saw one of his carts capsized into a ditch, both horses killed, the cart was full of brown bread.  Left just as it fell.  German prisoners burying their own dead.  Saw 14 put into one hole.  One of our tank accounted for 150 men, and goodness knows how many machine guns.  The Huns rushed it and poured petrol on it, and then set it on fire.  The occupants were roasted alive.  Dozens of our tanks out of action.
