<p>5th May (Friday) Strange to say, orders for moving came. Tents were struck and everything transported by camels &amp; waggons to Rail Head. I went with the advance party. We all had a hard day's work and were very sorry indeed to have to leave this "good home". It was the best camp we have been in so far. Another camp had to be pitched on arrival at Rail Head.</p>
<p>6th May (Saturday) Very hot. Digging deep sand-bag pit from <u>7 a.m.</u> till <u>9 p.m.</u> It fell in numbers of times &amp; finally collapsed altogether so we went to bed after hard</p>
