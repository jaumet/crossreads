<p>Dear Fry,<br/>It was all my fault &ndash; I should have mentioned that it is the big Annual picnic which takes place in Victoria every year. It takes in the whole Postal Service of Victoria, and is not a Sectional affair like the "Burgess" one in Sydney. It takes in man and woman and you know there are a lot of the latter in the Victorian Dept. and with the advent of the franchise they are going to be a power. The picnic is a pretty big affair down here</p>
