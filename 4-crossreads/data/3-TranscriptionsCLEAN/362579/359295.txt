Spare cash   &  I wanted to send him some tobacco but of course did not have time to buy it. He had had some leave   &  been to visit some of his relations. Hope Charlie   &  Ron are kept in England for some time yet. I hate the thought of any of them coming over to fight here.
So glad to hear that you are all keeping well   &  that little Eddy will be able to commence School. Suppose Fred will soon be back from leave   &  then I may see him. I shall try to write to my friends. I did write a few lines to Annie thanking her for the soap, also to Mollie.
Very pleased the Lucy visited Mother   &  hope you will all be friendly now.
Love to my friends   &  tell them to write to me.
Fondest love   &  kisses to you all.
FromYours lovinglyEdith
