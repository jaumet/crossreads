<p>4th October.  Weather still showery but shows signs of clearing up.  Usual fatigue &amp; "working parties" out on the various jobs that we have in hand, &amp; I can tell you I have my work cut out of a morning getting them together for they are so scattered &amp; the new hands are not used to the game yet, it takes them a terrible long time to get ready, &amp; as for water they are always wanting it, they have not learned to control their thirst yet, all the old hands never touch water unless they absolutely need it &amp; a man is much better for it for you never know when the time may come when water is unprocurable &amp; you have to go without for 2 or 3 days (I have done it before today) that's when it hurts the heavy drinkers.</p>
