 Abdul has becom a great friend and is a captur from the Turk at Beersheba . He is one of the most beauti littl creatur I have ever set eye on : a perfect model of Arab breed and blood . Go , howev , was bad . The road were still sticki and treacher with hole from the recent rain , but in spite of this difficulti we made good time . The good weather was threaten a breakdown which threaten was realis more speedili than anticip . The rain came down in delug , flood the road and brought the Waddi down gusher . The journey we conclud soak through , and splash through a mud sludg , churn up by thousand of hoof . The transport was held up by their frequent sink axl deep in the soft ground and the flood stream .
