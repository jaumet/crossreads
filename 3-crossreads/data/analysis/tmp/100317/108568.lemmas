 also some pineappl . A man name Rogan was at the latrin and a shell or bomb land fair on his lap kill him . I met " Bull " McLeish the stretcherbear and he was veri puf and rather shaken . He and anoth had the remain on a waterproof sheet and could not carri it ani further . So Davi I gave them a hand and dump the terribl burden over the back of the parapet until kind night allow us to buri him . This poor chap was near blown to bit , the leg were hang shred and the whole content of the abdomen were hang out . A dread sight . All the way along the trench were dab of blood etc . Told the nearest post to get dri earth to cover up the mess . Now met some wound men come along the trench hit by whizzbang none veri serious .
