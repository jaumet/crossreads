<p>up on top of one another, they never bothered about draining the trenches, so it is falling to our lot to put them in working order this morning I had 20 men from 4.30 till 11.30 taking up these duckboards &amp; cleaning the muck out &amp; then digging a small drain to carry the water underneath the boards, this makes a good job of it</p>
<p>The trenches are that close together that they sent a man back to the supports because he coughed to much &amp; would give the position away he belongs to the "Lewis gun.</p>
<p>We had a few "Minnewerfers &amp; "pip-squeaks" over this afternoon but they done no damage, though last night a pip-squeak wounded</p>
