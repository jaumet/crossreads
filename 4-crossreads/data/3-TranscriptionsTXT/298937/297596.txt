 Sunday 11th June 1916 
 Yesterday we were told to prepare to march off at 11. We marched off &ndash; 100 yds or so to the 2nd Stationary Hosp. to which we are attached for rations now. How we are going to fare now I can't imagine. There is no sign of going away. Schoeheuner [?] Highton, Marr &amp; numerous other tent mates of mine in old [indecipherable] are here &amp; yesterday I gave them a little music in return for a good dinner. We are in tents &ndash; about 60 of us &ndash; isolated, &amp; doing nothing.
