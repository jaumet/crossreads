Tuesday 31 July 1917
Had a funny experience last night. Two of our Secret Agents came thro' our lines. Dressed as Bedouins they showed the Officers where they carried their messages etc. & also took off Turbans & exhibited 5 or 6 Turkish sovereigns. After satisfying myself they were genuine I gave them a Pass sent them on to D.H.Q.
Imagine my surprise when I was rung up on Telephone & accused of taking a Turkish Sovereign from one of the Agents. This is an old Oriental Confidence trick that works with our Officials sometimes. This time they drew a blank.
