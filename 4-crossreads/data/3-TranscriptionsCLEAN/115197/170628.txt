 Reveille 6.30. 
 Account of Hawker''s & Grieve's rescue & return. 
 Australians to the front! 
 Stirring scenes. 
 At 11 a.m. we draw out from the wharf at Devonport and sail slowly down the harbour of Plymouth.  While our band plays patriotic airs - "Auld Lang Syne" .  "Good-byee" and lumps rise in our throats (for after all we are human & have human sympathies).
