  
 YMCA Dugout as they call it & had tea there. It was a very enjoyable afternoon. The afternoon was fine though windy, to night it is raining. Red Cross Hospital Oaklands Clevedon Somerset 21.9.18 Was transferred to this hospital yesterday afternoon. Clevedon is a very pretty residential place, from my bedroom window I can look out over the Bristol Channel & see Cardiff in the distance. The food here is much better than what it was at Beaufort, & everything else is very nice. This morning I had walk along the esplanade & through the streets, there are some very fine houses. This afternoon I went to the pictures, free to wounded soldiers.  Before leaving Beaufort I watched an x ray photograph being taken, but I could not see much. Received some Aussie mail this morning, & yesterday a parcel. Sept 25th Clevedon. Am having a very nice time. There are a lot of nice walks & have been on the pier, on the hill at the back. Yesterday afternoon I went to the pictures again.
