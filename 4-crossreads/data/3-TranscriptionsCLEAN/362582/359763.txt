She must be working very hard for the Red Cross - but she does nothing by halves - if she takes up anything she sees that it is a success. She is sending me some cocoa for myself & some cigarettes for the soldiers - the cocoa is a brand that I liked when in Port Fairy & she has remembered - I could not take it now but will be glad of it later on, no doubt. So sorry to hear that poor Laing is ill again - he is a delicate bot. I'm afraid need very careful treatment all his life. Last Friday poor old Fred came to say good bye, they did not go the week before, were ready all the week waiting to leave every day. He brought me a p.card photo of himself, taken on his horse. He was looking well & very delighted at getting a move on. I have not heard if they have left Alexandria yet, but suppose so. Such a fine lot of men - they had to leave their horses here - so went as dismounted Inf. The horse is of no use in that country.
