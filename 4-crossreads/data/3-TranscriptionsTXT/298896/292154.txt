 Friday 30th Aug. We are now the Main Dressing Station the 15th having passed through us &amp; formed an A.D.S. near Estrees about 6 miles further on. Had to supply them with dressings so collected more during the day. Went up by car to see the A.D.S. very interesting country, some of it being the old battleground of 1916 &amp; although grown over still showed the shellholes etc. Dead horses were numerous &amp; the air was thick in their neighbourhood, some had be buried in the shellholes of the road, others were still uncovered, some having been there for months, showing how careless the huns are in this respect, they are distinctly dirty &amp; unsanitary. We captured a large gun near here 15 inch I believe with barrel over 50 ft but I have not yet seen it. The Road has already been mended &amp; trains, broad guage &amp; narrow &amp; telephone lines (permament) have already reached close to the line. There is nothing wrong with our organisation.
