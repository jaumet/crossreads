<p>30th April<br/>My dear Ferguson, I cannot tell you how pleased I am to hear from you and to know that you are now safely in England and are getting on so well. I can quite imagine what a good time you are having with all those nice girls calling upon you. Oh how I envy you and wish I were in your place and what a time too you</p>
