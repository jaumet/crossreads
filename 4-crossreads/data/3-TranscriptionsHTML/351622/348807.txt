<p>6 April 1916 Thur<br/>An uneventful day nothing in particular happened save that we received orders that we are to pack up to-night &amp; march back to Thiennes to join our Head Quarters. Left Steenbecque 5.30 pm after bidding farewell to Jeanie &amp; Madeline. Thus ends the happiest week I have spent in the army.</p>
<p>7 April 1916 Fri<br/>Reveille at 5 am early breakfast &amp; with packs up left Thiennes. All the 5th Brigade leave Steenbercque to-gether. A great sight. Pass General Joffre &amp; staff on the road. Passed through Hazebrouck dinner time &amp; several other villages during day. Arr Outersteene about 5 pm. after doing some 15 miles. Camped for the night in an old school room.</p>
