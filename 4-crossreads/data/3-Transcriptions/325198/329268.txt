<p>16 March, 1916<br/>Serapeum<br/>Tuesday night [14th] we had to go out on a patrol.  It was hurry up at 5.30, we camped a mile out &amp; Bill Ross took charge of the patrol of three men on the Left flank on the Rway line.  Next morning we got in about 10.30, it was red hot &amp; one did not feel much inclined to exert oneself much - I had to go on picquet to make it worse &amp; was sleepy on it.  Wish we would get out of this place some where  where something is doing</p>
