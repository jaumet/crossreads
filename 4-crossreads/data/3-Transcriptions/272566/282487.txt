<p>Tuesday 13 February</p>
<p>8.30 a.m.  Now in Berwickshire near the sea coast after crossing the Border Bridge.  Jean waiting at the station with a motor car.  Travelled 9 miles to Ayton.  Looked round the grounds and the village of Ayton during the day.<br/>This is rather a pretty spot &ndash; snow caps the surrounding heights.</p>
