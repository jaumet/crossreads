<p>told to wait round until inspection at 11 directly after which we were dismissed until 2.30 and played bridge until dinner time. In the afternoon parade 12 of us were told off to go on fatigue and we went to a wash-house and sat down until four o'clock when we were dismissed <strike>until</strike> instead of 5 o'clock. We went to the pictures in the evening but it wasn't much of a lantern and the pictures were all French by Pathe Freres. but also translated as well as in French. One picture of Charlie Chaplin which I saw at the 'Pav' when going to the University. Men for leave were read out to-day and I wasn't among them. But may go next week. Only 3&amp;percnt are supposed to get off to Cairo each Saturday and 2 on Sunday. No letters appeared yet.. There was a bit of fuss <strike>yet</strike> last night and all the native bazaar was burnt out by men who couldn't get enough liquor. All the silks in the Curiosity Shop went.<br/>29.4.16 This morning we went for another march round the West end of the camp and saw the orange gardens. Eggs for breakfast 3 for 1 or 2 1/2d. Nothing to do till 9.30 parade. When our Sergeant called another man &amp; myself out to parade at the Orderly Tent where we had our names taken for military policemen while we stayed in this camp. Rest of the afternoon we were off. Thought over it during the afternoon and decided to try and dodge it if possible as it is a beastly job and I desire to try for my stripes. Played bridge until 9 o'clock and then talked in bed for an hour with Ludlow who had been to Cairo. Disgusting -.<br/>30.4.16 Got up for Church parade at 7 before which I went down to see the sergeant of the Camp Military Police and managed to get off as another chap chum of the person called out with offered to take my place &amp; I was jolly glad. 4 competent surveyors called for to-day and I think I'll try my luck. Church Service was rather flat but taken by Rev Perry of Norwood Football Club who was in camp at Mitcham when I was there. Fair address and communion after breakfast in Y.M.C.A. which I'm not going to attend &ndash; writing and reading instead. Number of our men visiting Tel-El-Kebir battlefield to-day about 5 miles away but I will go later. To be inspected by the staff officers including about 5 generals, and a mob of captains, lieutenants and Indian Officers. Spend the evening reading Tennyson and writing letters. Sent in my application for surveyor but many applied and I hardly like my chance.<br/>1.5.16 Ordinary Fatigue work all day shifting bundles of hay and corn. Eileen's marriage paper from Home Notes in the afternoon came by post. Oh, joy, at tea time 10 letters came for me. I nearly went mad and have fad a headache all the evening from reading them. 4 from Melv, 3 mother 1 Eileen 1 N.A.R Sydney and one from Headquarters.</p>
