<p>Wednesday December 8th.</p>
<p>7 a.m.  Anchored at last in Suez Harbour.  Our first stop since leaving Sydney. The coast line is very rugged &amp; has a peculiar yellow colour, looks as if at one time there had been a volcanic upheaval. Great excitement prevails almost every man was fully dressed long before reveille had sounded all anxious to disembark. The Orsova has just been sighted, it also has troops on board. Suez looks to be a very large city, two warships are anchored quite close to us &amp; round the boat are quite a number of small craft. Discovered that Roy Ingram was signalling to us from the Orsova, Eric &amp; I had quite a long chat with him on the flags. The harbour looked very pretty at night with all the boats lit up.</p>
<p>9th December.<br/>Another very monotonous day, at anchor waiting until the Orsova has disembarked her troops. Eric went ashore with the Measles &amp; Mumphs patients &amp; saw that they were admitted to the Suez Hospital, he was not very much impressed with the port. Have been very busy all day packing the medical equipment. The band gave a splendid performance in the evening.</p>
<p>10th December.<br/>All on board are terribly disappointed on receiving the news that it would be impossible to disembark to day, we are just like a lot of prisoners, anchored about &frac12; mile</p>
