<p>amusing.  All gambling has been stopped at least openly, the only game being allowed being " House".  Several schools are running &amp; all over the ship can be heard the cries, Who'll have a card?, eyes down, Kelly's eye, Clicketty Click, Top of the house, legs eleven etc. etc.  Altho not in sight in imagination one can see a number of men gazing intently at their cards waiting for particular numbers to be called, until one calls out House &amp; all sit up, relax &amp; then prepare for the next round.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26th  A  beautiful day with sea as calm as a mill pond.  Passed Gibraltar during the night &amp; this morning could see the snow clad mts of Spain.  Thursdays run totalled 336 miles.  Entered into a Calcutta sweep for the next days run.  Tickets cost 2/- each &amp; each man has a distance drawn for him, the distances later being put up for auction so that a fancied number may be bought by an outsider unless the owner buys it back by bidding higher.  To keep mine I had to bid 4/-.  The band played selections during the evening.</p>
