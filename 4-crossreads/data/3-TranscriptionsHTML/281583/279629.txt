<p>4.9.16  Monday</p>
<p>We have all had a very lively time today owing to Fritz putting over some of his big shells &amp; strange to say keeping it up. It has occurred several times today &amp; at the present moment has been resumed. He started by putting over a few "whiz-bangs" &amp; has kept it up with high explosive, alternating with shrapnel at various periods for range &amp; direction purposes. Owing to the humidity of the air, the explosives could always be seen before the familiar hiss in the air reached us. They were shelling a high ridge just near us, &amp; about 500 yards away &amp; can tell you it sent creepy feelings down my spine. You would hear a deafening report &amp; see the earth spring up into the air for about 30 feet, whilst through the debris one could see pieces of iron &amp; steel flying in all directions, Lots of soldiers were running to each shell burst to obtain souvenirs but I let them alone.</p>
<p>The shrapnel started next &amp; although far more dangerous, owing to its spread, was not so bad on the nerves. One would hear the far-away explosion of the gun (which we can all swear to now) &amp; a few seconds later a vivid flash in the air, together with a dense volume of smoke &amp; a deafening</p>
