 Dear George, this is the Portcullis lowered. The wall is 7 feet thick here. The crown Jewels are kept in the Room on the right at the Back of the Sentry Box. There are 3 officials on the Watch all the Time. If the Jewels are required for a State Function they are secretly removed   &amp;  no-one knows how they get to the Destination. A Yeoman told me that he has seen them removed from the case  &amp;  taken downstairs. He has formed up his men  &amp;  marched behind the cart which was only a 10 second walk from the case,   &amp;  on arriving at the Palace, the Guard there has said 'All Right' Sgt. Major I have them safe   &amp;   he found that He'd been marching his Men behind an empty cart  Harry
