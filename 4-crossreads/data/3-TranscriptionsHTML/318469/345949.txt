<p>was hit in the back with stray bullet, it is thought seriously. Saps Getty &amp; Powell missing.  Tommies &amp; Australian casualties in this action said to about 5,000.  Working today on barbed wire improvements.</p>
<p>9th<br/>The day opened with terrific bombardment from boats &amp; land guns.  All today almost without ceasing both the land guns &amp; those of the boats have been pouring shell into the enemy's positions.  Everywhere almost from every position shells are screaming through the air at times there is a perfect roar of guns &amp; shells.  At times the Turks can be seen reaching over the back of their trenches in their hurry to get away.  They are fighting very bravely though &amp; hold their positions very firmly &amp; in the face of terrific shell fire at times.  They are inflicting very heavy losses on our boys &amp; when we win through this engagement it will be at heavy loss.  Still doing well &amp; holding positions taken from enemy.</p>
<p>10th<br/>I was working on repairs to trenches today again early this morning &amp; last night nearly all day with only short intervals between the bursts there has been a terrific bombardment our shell appearing to be going almost everywhere the enemy is established.  On Hill 971 where the Tommies had to fall back slightly last night there has been hundreds of shells falling &amp; at times while I was in the trenches I could plainly see Turks running away from the Inferno.  I was in the trenches captured from the Turk a few nights since &ndash; this afternoon.  The sight there is awful, hundreds of our boys lying about dead in the open &amp; right on the parapets &amp; a lot even behind the trenches in some places there are heaps of them.  There are a lot of Turks laying about too</p>
