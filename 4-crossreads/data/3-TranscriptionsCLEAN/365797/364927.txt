 the week end with her mother-inlaw at Glenbrook. Alec writes that he is in Egypt & finds it a dirty place wants a good sweeping. He found Roll [indecipherable] & so is happy. 
 We have had no word from Oliver so he must have gone round the Cape. 
 We are very quiet nothing but Red Cross, Six o"clock" Closing Liberal Meetings & such good works going on. The weather is just lovely spring & the birds are very busy. What a treat it must be to you all to be in France(?) & see green fields & flowers instead of sand. 
 In the Sunday Times today there is a group of photos - the Howell-Price family, fine sons in khaki four in the D.S.O. & the eldest is a Lieut Col. at 26
