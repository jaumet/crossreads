  
 photo taken before going back this time. I had a few post cards taken a few weeks ago but have heard nothing of them yet although they may be waiting for me at the battalion. I will be glad to get my letters as it is now some time since I have had any home news. The news of late in the papers has been most encouraging and every day brings a fresh advance and a new victory for us. Now that the winter is nearly over, every day sees our worst hardships disappearing for although we have a severe winter here France in spring time is very mild. I hope that all is still going on well at home and that the orchard is doing well with all the wet weather. I sincerely hope that poor old Aub is getting well again, I should like to get a letter from him as soon as he is well enough to write. Trusting this will reach you safely and find you all in the best of health. With fondest love to all Your loving son Gordon
