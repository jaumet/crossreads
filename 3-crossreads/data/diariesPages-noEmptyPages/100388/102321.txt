There is nothing much to be seen at night except shops ablaze with lights. They keep open till they are tired then they close. There seems to be no specified time for closing Sunday is just the same to them.
It takes nearly an hour to go into Cairo from Mena and I am not going in again until I really have to. That is at night. I will go in the day if possible so as I can have a look at the mosques temples.
I am going to climb up the Pyramids some time next week.
20th
Very clear cold: natives worked well so I was finished early. I have to turn out again shortly though.
Church parade at 10 am. It is hard to realize that Xmas is so near. I dont suppose it will make any difference to us.
The 7th Battallion left for Cairo at 4 am on duty.
All guards are armed with ball cartridge after 10pm.
I have finished this book but will continue my diary in another which I have bought in Cairo.
