Here we are close up to Bombay, and so much sooner than I had expected, so must be closing. I don't need to say that I shall be thinking of you all at Xmas though that will all be past before this reaches you.  I have not written to anyone else from here I had such a sickening of it to post at Colombo, so I should be glad if you see Mill or any of my pals if you would tell them that we called at Bombay & present my compliments.

With a great deal of love, Yours very lovingly Olive How is that Scamp getting on? OHO initials.
