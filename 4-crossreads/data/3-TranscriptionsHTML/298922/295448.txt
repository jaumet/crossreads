<p>The Turksare better diggers than we are at present. We occupy what was once their Field Hospital. Big Crescent made of White Stones like rather worn Funk holes &amp; so suffer casualties.</p>
<p>[This sentence crossed through.] Turkswere reported in front early this morning but turned out to be PELICANS feeding on the plain when day light broke.</p>
<p>Your Parcel of Vegetables from Mutual Store arrived safely tonight, many thanks.</p>
<p>Jim Ayre is in my Brig. having a crack, he is pretty fit still &amp; just had some news of Jean &amp; Lucy. POLL DAY held in my Dug Out I.W.W. versus WIN THE WAR PARTY.</p>
