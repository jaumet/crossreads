  
 R.M.S. "Osterley". Monday 
 My Dear Judge 
 Please accept my sincere thanks for "The Dawn of History" which is interesting me very much indeed. It was good indeed of you to trouble to get it. 
 We again have splendid services yesterday, but I have unfortunately lost my sea legs & am very unhappy today. 
 Please convey my regards to Mrs Ferguson, & be sure that if I come within reach of your son you will hear from me. 
 Yours very sincerely 
 W. Meredith Holliday.
