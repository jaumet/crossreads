<p>My own beloved Mother<br/>We left Rabaoul on Oct 4th Monday at 3.30 pm and arrived here at 10.30 pm on the following Monday &ndash; we had a very rough trip &ndash; fortunately we only had 8 patients &ndash; nearly all the sisters were <u>very</u> seasick quite incapacitated &ndash; Sister Clouston and I did the work, there was not much to do. We were able to sleep on the deck all the time, the spray came in a little but the deck was screened off. The weather was hot, <u>but </u> such a strong wind blowing that I had to a [indecipherable] a [indecipherable] all the time. The day before we reached Suva, the weather was perfect. I enjoyed every minute of it.<br/>The entrance to the harbour was very lovely and we went on shore and had afternoon tea at a good hotel. Went for a motor drive. The vegetation is beautiful.<br/>I am very well &ndash; but long to be home again. I am writing now</p>
