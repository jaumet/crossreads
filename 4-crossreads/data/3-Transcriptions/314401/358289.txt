<p>The work being accomplished in the early hours of this morning. The advance had to be carried out thro' dense bush which was infested by the enemy, who consisted of Native Police under the command of German officers and N.C.O.s. The approach to the W/T station was defended by lines of trenches   &amp; mines. I much regret that during the attack the Naval Brigade lost 2 officers 4 seamen killed, one officer &amp; three seamen wounded. Killed, Lt. Cmd Elwell, Capt G.A. Pockley, R.A.M.C. W.G.V. Williams A.B., Street (A.B.) John Courtney A.B. Wounded Lt. Bowen, Skillean A.B. Sullivan A.B. Tonks A.B. Robert Moffatt A.B. We have captured 2 German officers, 5 N.C.O's &amp; 39 Native Police". All the wounded were brought off to the flagship where I saw them as soon as the doctors had made them comfortable. Lt. Bowen had a fearfully narrow escape; a bullet entered his helmet &amp; scraped his scalp &amp; that was all. Poor Moffatt was badly mangled blunt nosed bullets had made havoc of his back &amp; there was no hope for him. He died at 7.30 the following morning. The funeral took place on the quarter deck at 10.30. Admiral, officers &amp; every available man was present. It was fearfully &amp; awfully solemn. The circumstances attending the killing of Captain Pockley were truly pathetic. He had gone, being a doctor, to the assistance of a wounded German. That made no difference for he was shot down. Moffatt's funeral was delayed by an accident on board which might have been very serious. You will remember that on each side of the ship there is sling a boat to be used for emergency purposes. We were coming into Rabaul harbour at about eight knots &amp; the sea boats crew was ordered into her. It seems that a pin had been put in wrong. At any rate one end of the boat slipped out of its fastening &amp; shoots every man into the sea. Most of them were rescued immediately, but two cd. not be seen. The ships head was brought round, the patent life buoy dropped and I am glad to say they were picked up very little the worse for the peril they had gone through. Things are lively today, and we are all agog with curiosity when the prisoners are brought on board.</p>
