Fierce arguments among QM staff as to whether Fritz is lousier then we are. Such gems of conversation as float over here from the staff positively corruscate with oaths. "Jonah" considers that war is good as these places are so old that they want knocking down. One house dated 1723 was smouldering today ? "by the f...." is a stock phrase of Jones. MM. Hunt's search for dugout proved fruitless so he is sleeping close and I have told him that if a 10" shell falls on me he will know all about it. 
Brigade HQ has pushed on ahead ? everyone is out of touch. Rear echelons will want to get moving. A sticky job in front of us digging in opposite his Cambrai Line. 
Furphey that the G. is getting 6th Divn Quite to our disappointment Fritz did not put any heavy stuff into us during the night but remained absolutely quiet and silent. Slept like a top throughout until morning.
