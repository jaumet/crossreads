<p>the force was undisciplined, &amp; that the officers were not doing their job.  I say &amp; say deliberately that the Division is a show of which Australians ought to be proud &ndash; the discipline is strict, the men are well behaved, the Training is good &amp; the officers really do run their jobs well.  If any one tries to tell you otherwise, don't believe it.  It is a bit annoying &ndash; to put it mildly &ndash; to feel that people at home are doubtful &amp; dissatisfied &amp; critical, when we who are here know that they have had false &amp; in some cases malicious accounts given them.</p>
<p>The men are all very keen &amp; work like Trojans, &amp; they deeply resent some of the things that are said.  However, there is no use in getting warm about it.  It is sufficient to say that the Division is <strike>by</strike> far <strike>the</strike> in advance in point of training &amp; discipline what we might reasonably have expected.</p>
<p>As for the 1st Inf. Bde. I really do think that N.S.W. might be proud of it.  I have had very little trouble in keeping discipline.  The Bde. is now a living organic unit with a fairly established esprit de Brigade, so to speak.  We have been complimented upon the state of our war equipment &amp; upon the nature of our training.  I need say no more.</p>
<p>Young Street is quite well again &amp; is doing duty with his Battalion.  So there is no need for his father to be anxious.</p>
