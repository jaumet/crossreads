<p>Mena House<br/>The Pyramids<br/>Egypt<br/>10 May 1915</p>
<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>9.30 pm.  Letters were posted to you today with hopes that they may have safe passage from Egypt to Australia.</p>
<p>Wounded men have been pouring into here all day.  Our admissions up to 5 pm have been 420.   As we are the hospital furthest removed from the seat of fighting, how full must those nearer be.  We do not get the serious cases, as they are intercepted on the road to us.   The fortune of the game I suppose.  On account of the work requiring to be done the D.M.S. has, as far as I know, done nothing in regard to my removal.  I shall be sorry to leave for the men and the works sake, but I shall have no regrets on the side of the O.C. &ndash; I have been &amp; am loyal to him, only because it is my duty as a soldier and a man to be so, but my feelings for him otherwise are those of a very humble kind.   Have just finished work and must sleep as I have been going hard since 6 A.M.   Good night!  Good night!!!  Good night!!!!!  A letter was posted to Mollie too.   Like unto yours it was far too long. Have taken out four bullets during the day.</p>
<p>2-5-15. 9 p.m. Busy with patients and as acting OC. today. We have nearly 500 wounded men tonight. Those only slightly injured will be got away in a few days.   Two were discharged from one of my wards today. Colonel Martin</p>
