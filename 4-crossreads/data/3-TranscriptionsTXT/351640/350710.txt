The 5th of April is the anniversary of the birth of Lord Lister, the member of my profession who adapted the work and discoveries of the great Pasteur (Shepherd, Padre, Father) to medicine and surgery.  The immediate sequel to which were the rapid strides that have made possible the saving of life, by both branches of our art, which today extends throughout the length and breadth of the land.  Both these great men came into the world for the benefit of more than mankind, and left it much the better for their having lived, with you, me, and all others their debtors.  Lister born 1827 A.D.
An Australian mail reached Cairo today, General Williams told me that he received a letter from Melbourne.  I shall hope that fortune will have turned her wheel in such manner that some letters will be in my hands from you within a few days.
Good night!  Good night!!!  Good night!!!!![A line of Xs and Os.] Car. [A line of Xs and Os.] Joseph [A line of Xs and Os.] Kitty.
6-4-15. 2-20 p.m.  Hurrah!  hurrah!!!  hurrah!!!!!Letters have just been handed to me, two bearing the "Blackheath" and one "Sydney" post marks.  The former on opening and reading were found to be from you Car dear, the dates being 25th Febry and 8th March.  Many thanks for them my dear.  The other was from Doffie, a chatty characteristic series of paragraphs.  I shall write a reply to her soon.
Glad that you were pleased with my letter, it is an earnest that others may be amusing and interesting.  Doris too, that is good.  The stars still shine brilliantly except on the rare occasions when the clouds shut out heaven's dome.  No not yet joined the problems.
