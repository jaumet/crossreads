 At Stanthorpe the Chairman of the Council made a speech which I did not hear, thanks to a pretty girl with a tray of peaches, (more in my line) &amp; also at Warwick Toowmba (dinner) &amp; Helidon we got refreshments. At Ipsch Tom, Edie &amp; the family, Joe Sheppard Chas. L. TG &amp; Mrs Springall &amp; a few others including Lil Handley met us. Tom said family would wait engine end of platform Arrived at Central OK. &amp; struggling with kitbags etc Molly was the first spotted. She told me where the family were &amp; I told her Dave was coming somewhere behind me, &amp; she left to look for him. Crowds of relatives very dense &amp; almost impossible to work through. Eventually I found Mater, Dad, Aunt J. Billy &amp; Molly Gunn inside Sturgy &amp; Allan outside &amp; after a few mins, we got in cars, passed down Edward Queen &amp; went up Albert St to Market Square, where Goold Adams (Gover) Theodore &amp; a few parliament &amp; municipal authorities made speeches of welcome. We all wished they would cut it out. However we all met together &amp; went out to Aunt Jacks &amp; altho I was not in the slightest hungry could not resist the fine dinner &amp; did it full justice. Tom landed down about ten min's after our train. Next day we got fixed up at the Barracks, &amp; about 2pm left for home, calling at Tom's place en-route with cars Buick &amp; [Indecipherable]. Ad.
