<p>4:XI:16<br/>Busy as usual.<br/>Have been made L/Corporal this week as the establishment is out.<br/>Promised more later, but still count myself lucky if I can get away with permanent L/Corp. rank to France.  There it will be something to work on.<br/>Received more letters from Base including 2 from <strike>2</strike> dear old Rita, one from <strike>P.J.</strike> Rev Nyland, a nice Christmas card from little Andy Steen at school</p>
