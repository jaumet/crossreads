<p>8 hours over an hours trip normally.  Having missed the boat, repaired to a rest home for  Sgts &amp; W.O's conducted by Mrs Hildyard, everything buckshee and remarkably well done.  The dinner was first rate, after which I did the town &amp; went into a picture show, returning to the billet where I shaved etc in readiness for the morning, the boat going about 9 oclock.</p>
<p>Thursday 28th Nov  up at 6 with severe pain, something in last nights dinner upsetting me.  Had breakfast &amp; then went off to the boat which sailed at 9.30.
