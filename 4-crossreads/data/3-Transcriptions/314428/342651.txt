<p>[written in shorthand]<br/>Copy of report.<br/>Re progress of shorthand course.<br/>To the Educational Officer,<br/>Sir,</p>
<p>I have the honour to report that the shorthand course consists 7, one of whom, Private [indecipherable] failed to attend during the past few weeks.  All the others have made rapid progress, especially Lance Corporal [indecipherable], who had no previous knowledge of the subject, and is now almost through the book.  He reads the outlines well and is very good in distinguishing the correct vowel signs, but with other studies, including [indecipherable] have sufficient grasp of the subject to be able to carry on with the instruction, correcting their work [indecipherable] which I have tested them, to obtain and get assurance.  Those who joined the class later have not made so much progress but are improving and are [indecipherable] in the subject.</p>
