<p>things are going with you.<br/>I got the piece of shell taken out of my leg last week and it is starting to heal up again, although the nurse says it will be a long time before it is better.<br/>The Fifth Brigade went away from here this week and there is a rumour about that they were cut up pretty bad. I think I have told you all the news about the first and last battle I was ever in, or ever want to be in. If I have to go back I will, but I think "Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof".<br/>I will write again and let you know how I am progressing<br/>Love to George, Jack &amp; yourself<br/>Francis Clune</p>
<p>P.S. Write to me C/o the Hospital and I will have a better chance of getting your letter.<br/>Fran.</p>
