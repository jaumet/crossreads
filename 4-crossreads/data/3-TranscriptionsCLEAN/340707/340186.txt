  
 1) am not getting enough 
 9-7-19 I have been invited to Volney Club 7 Rue Volney to night as the guest of M. Dolleans & meet quite a nice number of peoples. Dinner as usual is good 2 wines, Soup, Fish, Meat, Jalousie, liqueur & coffee & all for 11 fr. Ordinary meal is 7 fr 
 After there is a pleasant concert & the girl who has gained the highest prize at Conservatoire this week plays on piano - a wonderful exhibition. 
 The Frenchmen here are very interesting being the first Australian to be entertained by Club I am treated as a little hero & treated to champagne etc. & introduced to lady singers. Upstair I visited the gaming rooms. All French clubs are kept going by the gambling clique & play is always very high. 
 I go home with [indecipherable] & Dolleans promises to put me up as a non resident member but I do not accept for the present as I must consider expenses. 
 10-7-19 From this date till 27-7-19 I have not written up anything and as in this period there was the French celebration of peace & national fete trip to Eng & peace celebrations there followed by a return & change of residence.
