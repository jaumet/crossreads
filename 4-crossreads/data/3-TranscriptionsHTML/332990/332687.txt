<p>Monday Aug 21. 1916.</p>
<p>There was great excitement last night on account of a rumour that Battalion had to go away immediately. A company were ordered to pack up their kit bags &amp; get their equipment ready. And went to bed with their clothes on. I went to the Y.M.C. A. in the evening after tea &amp;<br/>when I came back a message was waiting for me to go to the Battalion Headquarters &amp; report. From there I was forwarded to the 10th Machine gun Company's office about 3/4 of a mile away. The O.C. was away and I had to report back in the morning at 7 a.m.  When we were all in bed the Seargent came along and ordered all out of bed to draw new blankets and a waterproof sheet. This over we again got to bed this time with our clothes on and slept until morning.  We were all up at a quarterd to six packed up our kits</p>
