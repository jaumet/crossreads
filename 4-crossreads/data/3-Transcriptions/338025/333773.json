<p>Wednesday 22nd August 1917<br/>Dickebusch<br/>Harnessed and moved out by 8am. Went to Spoil Bank (nr. 18lb gun pits) for a load of old ammunition (18lbs) and brought it back to dump at Dickebusch.<br/>On the road up we passed great number of naval and other heavy guns. You may drive past a hedge or a thicket and never dream that it masks an entire battery so cleverly are the guns masked. Another trip to the same place in the afternoon finished about 6pm.<br/>10pm Tube over with lights but he returned very quick as our guns got on to him.</p>
