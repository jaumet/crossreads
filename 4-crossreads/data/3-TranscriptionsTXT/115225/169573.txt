Jno & I went round & spent the evening with Zita improving our french & her English. we are doing well  Zita is only sixteen & was going to school in Amiens until Fritz closed the school - Marie is twenty & works on the farm. Madame their Mother works around the house & looks after the cows, milks etc. & is a very kind motherly soul - Monsieur their Father is a business man & travells around the country with a fast  pony & trap buying & selling cattle -
 
June 5h  We worked on the car all day going down for our usual swim at noon Jno & I are not able to spare the time for a swim in the evening since we go regularly to Zita's. she is very inteligent & clever, & a nice girl. Marie is too quiet & simple but also very nice. I am on guard to-night - the boys spend lots of money at the estaminets in the evening & there is much noise when the said estaminets
