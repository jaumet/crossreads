<p>Bulford<br/>10.2.18<br/>Dear Dad,  I've written to Mum so as I have no more news I am just sending this P.C. I walked around the top path &amp; visited the Aquarium which is in the Building in front. The conger eels about 6 or 7 ft long were rather interesting but the entrance fee 6S would buy all the fish. The citadel at the rear of this building was erected in 1666. I went round it and under some archways &amp; subterranean channels &amp; emerged into the streets of old Plymouth. I saw the old fisherman mending their nets &amp; getting ready for sea. From the land at the extreme right of picture there is a long pier from which the sea planes making their daily jaunts. They are lifted on &amp; off the pier by a crane which moves along on rails. Only small vessels use this part of the sound the Battleships are right round the   [indecipherable]  &amp; in the Harbour at the other end. Best Wishes &amp;   Love to you  From Harry<br/>Regards to Otto</p>
