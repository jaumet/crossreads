<p>Seymour<br/>Wednesday 11th 1916</p>
<p>My Dear Mother<br/>Arrived here once more after pretty fair to middling trip, &amp; am writing this in lieu of a parade. Train travelling seems to produce a most peculiar disinclination for parades or work of any kind. The old camp looks much the same &ndash; a trifle drier perhaps, &amp; certainly rotten after Pitt Street! It is now officially stated that our embarkation is fixed for the 23rd,  when we will leave in the "Port Lincoln". Also, instead of the three lots of reinforcements, we will be quite a large crowd of M.G.s' together.<br/>When leaving I left parcel &amp; did not see the strength of rushing back for it at last minute. Also I left my razor in the wash-house &amp; the want of it is occasioning me much bad language. Will you send them on please &ndash; to this address:-<br/>Pte H.W.Pryce<br/>c/o Church of England Soldiers Institute<br/>Expeditionary Camp<br/>Seymour, Vic'.<br/>The company address is too unreliable &ndash; especially for the razor -  as too many have access to the mails.</p>
