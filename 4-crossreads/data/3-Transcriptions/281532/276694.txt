<p>13/9/18 Cappy</p>
<p>A good deal of rain fell during night and the morning was showery. Brigade telephoned that Sports were postponed so I arranged for the specialists to have a morning after their own hearts. Smith was among his Lewis gunners &amp; Hughes with his signallers. Put different people on the job of building sheds and making other improvements round the camp. Since our arrival we have made a great change in the look of this place.</p>
<p>14/9/18.</p>
<p>Went to D.HQ and sat with Colonel Ralston and others on a F.G.C.M. We tried Major Packer 105 How. Bty on various counts mostly connected with paybooks and passed sentence. Attended Bde Sports in the afternoon and we won a number of events &ndash; especially the field race but crashed on the tug of war.</p>
