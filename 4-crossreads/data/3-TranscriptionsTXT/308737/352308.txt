Darling Mum & KidsI've waiting to be able to tell you that I've got my commission, but it has not come through yet owing to some delay, & is not likely to for at least a fortnight.
Anyway, I now consider myself a bird-man, as I have flown a plane on my own, & stunted about the skies for 5 hours at all heights up to 3,500 ft. This I did in about 6 flights. I have put in something like 14 hours in the air already (i.e.) Dual, & solo. Dual is with an instructor.
