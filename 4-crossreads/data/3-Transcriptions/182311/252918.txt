<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The awards for the 29th of September to 2nd Oct-ober stunt are not all out yet, only the lowest, the M.M&#39;s are out, and my boys have scored four of them, I&#39;m hoping for another D.C.M. for a Sergt. and a Military Cross for an officer whom I recommended. <u>Later</u> for this battle I recd <u>Bar</u> to M.C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Up to now there is, I think, no more news, so I&#39;ll cut off to bed now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Best wishes from</p>
