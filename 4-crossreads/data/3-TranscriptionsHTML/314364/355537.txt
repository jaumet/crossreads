<p>Thur. Jan.16 (cont.)<br/>Quite a decent Dinner. Roast meat, &amp; plenty of vegetables &amp; Steamed Pudding. After dining got my pass from [indecipherable] Office &amp; took my seat in the car for Westham. The Driver said there were too many aboard, so Sgt. Duffy &amp; I had to walk in. Being such a fine day we quite enjoyed it. Took my pants to the Tailor in Weymouth to get the Leathers sewn on.  He promised to have them done by Monday. Then I went out to Westham &amp; saw the Q.M. about the Cape.  This kept me messing about for about an hour, &amp; then I got no satisfaction I'm afraid that money is as good as lost. Went up to see Col. Astbury, but he was out. So I returned to Weymouth &amp;  had Tea at a little shop. Bacon &amp; Eggs &amp; Bread &amp; Butter &amp; some excellent coffee all for 2/6d. This was not dear considering Eggs are 5 &frac12;d each. After Tea strolled around the town for a while, but not meeting anyone I knew I purchased a Box of Water Colors &amp; returned to Camp by Car [indecipherable]<br/>Fri Jan 19.<br/>Lloyd-George's Birthday, too.<br/><u>This is Frances' Birthday.</u>  I wonder how the poor old Girl is spending it. Got a nice long letter from her yesterday. She says they are having a very rough time. It is a beautiful day &amp; the diggers are sitting about in the sun &amp; quite enjoying it. The "Ulysses" &amp; "Manga" Boat Roll  crowd are leaving tomorrow &amp; they are buzzing around getting their things ready. Bert Berry is on the "Manga" &amp; Bill Beards is on the "Ulysses", &amp; 4 more fellows in my Hut are on the Roll. I shall be might glad to see my name on a Roll. The [indecipherable] is a long time putting in an appearance. Bill Beard came to say "Hooray". I gave him my address &amp; told him to give us a call if ever he gets as far as Sydney.  Sat.18. Another beautiful day quite frosty. It's quite a treat to be alive weather like this. Had a Bath after dinner &amp; donned a clean change. Washed all my dirty clothes, so now all my gear is clean. I just want a pair of Boots, &amp; they can stick me on a Boat Roll as soon as they like. The "Ulysses" &amp; "Manga" arrived left this morning.</p>
