Friday
Slept well. Up betimes sea very calm. Pass thro? Grecian Archipelago at noon. Both boats still persuing erratic course. Crete passed in late evening. An island rich in history. To far from it to form any idea of its worth. Snow capped mountains upon it. To bed early, no lights allowed on. Strict lookout for submarines. In hourly danger of their attentions.
