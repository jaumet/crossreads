<p>April 14, 15<br/>54.<br/>Tonight our first casualties, M. Gleeson 17534, and F.H. Clausen 17709.  Gleeson died an hour after arriving here:  has wound in S.W. Left thigh:  but there had been a severe hemorrhage. Clausen's a S.W. R. arm.  One shell, and their patient was rewounded with them.</p>
<p>[Drawing of cross.]<br/>From the dead face of Gleeson I could not place him:  but Les C. showing a photograph I recognised him at once.  A splendid type and an Australian.  Requiescat.</p>
<p>April 15<br/>55.  a.m.<br/>Just through, one Green of the 4th half filled according to Bacchanalia's custom of rum-rich mates, with deep dark rum, his wound a small shell splinter through the forehead by the eyebrow and in the eye-lid.  Made him a stretcher-case, Maj. Stewart holding his good eye closed.</p>
<p>"Can you see me lad?"<br/>"I can see half a dozen of you!"</p>
<p>"Joyful" didn't even flick an eyelash.  This our night Serg. and he wanders around as a lost ghoul.</p>
<p>56.<br/>Two Boche through &ndash; prisoners to the third Batt., one a boy of twenty, tall and golden, M.B. bullet through both thighs.  His legs well built and clearly drawn, but his body thin and his shoulders narrowly poor.</p>
<p>April 15<br/>57.  11.30 p.m.<br/>A long and deep sleeping from 10 a.m. till 7, our last case of the morning forgotten before sleeping by Moet &amp; Chandon.</p>
<p>At 8 from the next village a car brought in an old woman and her man, his right foot blown away at the ankle, his poor right leg doubly fractured, and his arms riddled with small shell fragments.  Even the terribly dead &ndash; writing ten yards away there's the dead body of a 6th Batt. boy whose brains were filling his throat, even the terribly dead are soon forgotten by a memory that closes its eyes, but the primitive tragedy of an old Flemish woman and her dying man sent us silent to bed.  Even if her love for him had shewn itself by the holding of their hands, or of a sweet caressing, the agony would have been human, but their agonies seemed their own &ndash; their accepting and monosyllabic speaking made the tragedy of terrible pathos.  I had to go out of the Dressing Room:  and on the road an old old peasant slowly passed, she bid me "Bon jour, M'sieur!" and I longed to hurry her away, but there's nowhere for her to go, her home is in ruin.</p>
