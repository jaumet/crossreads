<p>Thursday 22 July, 1915</p>
<p>Left Port Said 5 p.m., had a bit of luck at bunker yesterday. All sorts of natives came round the boat selling everything you could imagine, they always ask about twice as much as the things are worth.</p>
<p>Port Said is a very busy shipping centre. French &amp; English war&nbsp;vessels are berthed there together with a whole fleet of merchantmen.</p>
<p>The customs house &amp; several other buildings are very fine. There are two paths to the town -The Europeans &amp; Arab Town which lies the other side of the former, you can get there in a cab for 6d.</p>
<p>There is a fine breakwater running out in to the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The men slept at the 4.7 guns from Port Said to Alexandria in case we were molested by a hostile war vessel.</p>
