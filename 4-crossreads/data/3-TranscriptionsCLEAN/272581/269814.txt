March 1916just returned from the Persian Gulf where it had taken a lot of Tommies to. On the 24th I was put on ships guard & it was very monotonous but at about 11 am. That night we were supposed to have passed a transport which has been torpedoed by the Aleins. At 2 pm the next day we passed the island of Malta & very pretty it look too but we did not call in. On the 26th we were all inoculated & the following day I was put on Submarine Guard &  the same afternoon pulled into Toulon Harbour where we stayed till the next morning. We entered the harbour just after dinner & it is one of the prettiest places Ive ever seen for you have to pass a big brake water to enter & at the land end of the brake water are some fine big building of white stone with red tiled roof & big green lawns surrounding them. There is also a township built-on the water edge at the foot of a big mountain on the right hand side when entering. On the left are some more fine buildings & at the head of the harbour is a big naval base & coaling station. Near where we were tied up was the remains of some sunken vessel & it is several feet above the water. Ferry boats were busy running about & several other transports &  French naval boats occupied
