It was an interesting trip and very pretty. The old King had a very fine O.P. during the battle, but an extremely unhealthy spot in the light of modern experience of artillery fire. Crecy itself is one of the prettiest French villages I have seen and is almost clear.
Today being Sunday, we must go to Le Crotoy for tea. Being a filthy day we shall probably go in the car (30 cwt Lorry chassis)
There is nothing to write about we should cross to England about the 15th May &amp; then the sooner we leave for home the better.
