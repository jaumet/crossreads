 Oban . Pass out of the Kyle we glimps the open sea around Arran and then continu our cours via Turbert to Ardrishaig . Land on either side all the way . Got a motor at Ardrishaig and motor from there to Oban . Veri good road past crag , fell torrent and a lot of our 6 hour drive was taken up in the wind . The sceneri was splendid , such shade of green and brown . In place the countri is most barren and precipit in other soft and well suit to the art of husbandri . The loch alway have an impress background of mountain . Reach Oban about 6.30 and put up at the Caledonian Hotel . The town seem to be a favourit tourist resort , of cours this is the tourist season . Apparent most of the local folk are seafar . The air is veri cold which is rather unusu they say for this time of the year . Tire and have a rotten cold in the head the result of the trip down the Clyde two day ago . The sun set in a golden flame behind the Isle of Mull . At dinner the thought struck me , how tire waiter must get of the sight of food and minist to the selfish gourmandis mountain of gut you encount so often .
