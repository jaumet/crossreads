<p>196<br/>There are a couple of Trooper Bluegum"s in the 6 Litt.,<br/>"The Aust. Light Horse", Maadi, 1915</p>
<p>We"ve left out little geegees back in Maadi,<br/>We"ve started out on foot to fight the foe:<br/>For 'gravel crushing" makes us strong and hardy,<br/>And where we"re wanted, there the L.H. go.</p>
<p>Our Infantry have made Australia famous:<br/>Light Horsemen now are out to do their share<br/>And surely not a single soul can blame us,<br/>For bulling where there"s shrapnel in the air.</p>
<p>We couldn"t see our comrades far out numbered,<br/>While we in wicked Cairo lived in ease.  (?)<br/>We might do well have stayed back home and slumbered,<br/>So we"re off to bring the Kaiser to his knees.</p>
<p>It was pretty rotten parting with our horses,<br/>The horses we have learned to love so well:<br/>But Birdwood wants us badly with the forces,<br/>So we"re off to send the Sultan in to &ndash; Constantinople.</p>
<p>Pretty obvious jingle.</p>
<p>196<br/>My Dug-Out<br/>There"s a hole cut in the hill<br/>That"s my Dug-out:<br/>And somehow I fear no ill,<br/>In my dug-out.<br/>When the cannons roar like thunder,<br/>Parapets are sent asunder,<br/>I just duck, and snuggle under,<br/>In my dug out.</p>
<p>For I"m safe both day and night<br/>In my dug-out:<br/>Though I feel a troglodyte<br/>In a dug-out.<br/>Still it pays you to take care<br/>When there"s murder in the air,<br/>For its close to Sari Bair<br/>In my dug-out.</p>
<p>Now and then the bullets zip<br/>In my dug-out:<br/>but I never get the pip<br/>In my dug-out:<br/>For it soon becomes a habit<br/>Just to burrow like a rabbit.<br/>If a sandbags near, I grab it<br/>For my dug-out.</p>
<p>Strange the Turks have never found<br/>My little dug-out.<br/>For they drop their shells all round<br/>That little dug-out:<br/>But some day they"ll score a hit,<br/>High explosive &ndash; I am in it,<br/>But in that I guess I"ll flit,<br/>From my dug-out.</p>
<p>There"s a photo on the wall, (Kershore ? me!)<br/>of my dug-out.<br/>She"s the sweetest girl of all,<br/>For my dug-out.<br/>And when the scrap is over,<br/>We"ll just settle down in clover,<br/>For she wants the Khaki live,<br/>From a dug-out.</p>
