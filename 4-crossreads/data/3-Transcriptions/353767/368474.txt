<p>Nov. 1st  All told there were about forty ships that left Albany that day composed of as follows 37 transports carrying troops, horses, stores etc. &amp; three battleships.  One battleship is an English ship named the Minator, one an Australian ship named the Sydney (the same ship that sunk the Emden) &amp; one a Japanese boat named the Abouki.  From Albany we went to Colombo (a port in an island named Ceylon which is near India) one day when we were about half way between Albany and Colombo we saw the Japanese boat turn to her left &amp; steam away for all she was worth.  About an hour later we heard that the Sydney was in action with the Emden &amp; had been so for some hours &amp; a little later we heard that the Emden had been sunk.  Soon after we had received this news we saw the Japanese boat returning to her former position on our right.  The band then played God Save the King &amp; we all got half a days holiday.   [Emden was sunk on 17 Nov. 1914]</p>
<p>We arrived at Colombo on the 15th  of Nov &amp; left on the 17th.  Whilst we were in Colombo we got stores etc aboard &amp; some of the other ships got coal.  After leaving Colombo we proceeded to Aden &amp; there got further stores we arrived at Aden on the 25th of Nov &amp; left on the 26th .  From Aden we went to Suez &amp; arrived there on Dec 1st. We waited there for some hours &amp; then were allowed to go through the canal to Port Said.  We reached Port Said on Nov 2nd [Dec] &amp; after staying for about 12 hours</p>
