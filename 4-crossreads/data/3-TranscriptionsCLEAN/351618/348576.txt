Tuesday 27th JulyYesterday afternoon the enemy gave us taste of big shell fire. Things were a bit lively for some time but fortunately little damage was done. I went for a swim late in the evening. The nights are lovely and moonlight just now. A beautiful full moon. I was on watch late last night and left alone with my thoughts broken only by the crack of a rifle here and there or the staccato stutter of a machine gun. I looked back for all that had passed since I participated in this great warfare. One could not help feeling sad as one dwelt on the loss of so many fine lads as I had seen removed from our ranks on all sides. This present waiting game of ours has very little glory in it and we all feel impatient to attack the unspeakable Turks or be attacked by them. Our existence here is getting indescribably dreary.
I think I have mentioned before that from the beach up (Anzac Cove) there
