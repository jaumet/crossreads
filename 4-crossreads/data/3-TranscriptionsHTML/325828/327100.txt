<p>The adjutant of No 7 sent for me the other day &amp; when I told him my name he got up &amp; shook hands with me.  It was Capt. N.H. Hobbs, M.C. 18th Battn. whom Walter will remember at Randwick Hospital.  He asked very kindly after Wal, &amp; told me how he &amp; Wal used to chaff each other as to being fit again, &amp; he told me to tell Wally not to worry about coming over again, as he would not be fit again before the war finished.  He has been marked G.S. again and is awaiting orders to rejoin his Unit.<br/>The above is my address until further notice.  We are fairly comfortable in tents here, but have a good Mess.<br/>I am keeping in splendid health &amp; when I weighed myself the other day was surprised to see the pointer swing to 12 st. 7 lbs.</p>
