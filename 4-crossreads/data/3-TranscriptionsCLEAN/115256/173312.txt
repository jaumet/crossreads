Battalion field training to-day.  Great attention is now being paid to the rapid extension from the ordinary column of route to a formation which minimises the possible loss from shrapnel or shell fire.  We practised this continuously to-day, so that the battalion is evidently not too keen on being wiped out by the artillery.  To-day I was impressed by two things.  One was the competence, "command" and intelligence of our second-in-command, a highly trained colonial soldier and the other was the lamentable incompetence, lack of control, and mental dullness of our Commanding Officer, one of those so-called veterans, "a South African" man.  Most of this latter class of "old soldiers" are more bother than they are worth - especially if they fail to display a single soldierly quality.  On the other hand Major Ellis is a born soldier - a man in whom any person in this battalion would place the greatest confidence.  His ideas are clear;  and these same ideas are formulated in clear, concise orders.  He knows what he wants done - and gets it done.  But the other ... absolutely hopeless!
