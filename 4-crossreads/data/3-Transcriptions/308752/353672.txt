<p>The day that I have longed for -, my arrival in Sydney arrived at last. The cherished hope, so often conjured up in my mind, at last reveals itself in glorious reality. How often have I seen visions of Sydney Hds, and tried to imagine what my feelings would be like when the time came to see those Great Hd. Lands, which meant "Home Sweet Home, &amp; those dear to me. At 7 a.m. on Wednesday the 11th June, the entrance to Port Jackson loomed in sight, and words are not needed to describe my excitement as the "S.S. China" steamed into Sydney Harbour. All old familiar spots, such as Bradleys Hd, Mosman, Cremorne etc, I immediately picked out, and on seeing Neutral Bay my home suburb &ndash; that put the finishing touch on my feelings. Numerous launches crowded with women folk, approached the boat, &amp; the look of joy on their faces when they described some-one dear to them on board the troopship, was great to see.</p>
<p>After the health authorities had inspected the ship, the most important part of the days doings took place &ndash; The landing of the troops at Wooloomooloo Bay, where cars conveyed them to the Anzac Buffett, there to be greeted by friends &amp; relatives. My Parents quickly found me out, &amp; as to the great joy of the "noted" Colley-Priest trio, when this momentous meeting took place &ndash; well:  it can be left to your own imagination.</p>
<p>This ends the account of my experiences on Active Service, from the 9th November 1915 to the 11th June 1919.</p>
