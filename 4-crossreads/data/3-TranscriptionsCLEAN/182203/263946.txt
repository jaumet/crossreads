S.S. Kyarra14.4.15My dear Mother & sisters,I did not receive your letter, got the telegram, so suppose it will be forwarded on to Brisbane. Had a very enjoyable time in Sydney. When we arrived, a number of people were waiting to see some of us. Nurse Martin had two brothers also some friends, amongst whom were Mrs Hamilton & her daughter Mrs Johnstone (nee Veany Hamilton). They were surprised at seeing me so invited Martin & me to morning-tea on Monday. They live at Manley in such a charming position. I think I wrote & told you we went to Manley. A number of the other sisters came to Manley with us but spent their time on the beach.Also on the station was a Miss Graham a nurse training at Melb. Children's Hospital. A great friend of Dorothy Newton, she is home on holiday.We had afternoon tea with the Grahams & they are awfully jolly people. We stayed their until 5.30.p.m. Then Dorothy & I caught the 5.45 pm boat for Watson's Bay. Had tea there & caught the tram back to Sydney. We both enjoyed the outing immensely & Dorothy just loves the harbour but hates the city. Monday we had a busy day. I have told you how we spent the morning. Returned to Grahams for lunch
