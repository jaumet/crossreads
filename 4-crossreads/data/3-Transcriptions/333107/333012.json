<p>Fri. Mar. 8<br/>Sgt Mathieson and Bert Berry can to see me this morning. Both are looking well.</p>
<p>"Darkey" went on Leave.</p>
<p>After dinner I made myself a Bunk and filled my mattress with clean straw. "Bill Bailey" returned from Leave today and I had to give up his Bunk, which I have been using during his absence.</p>
<p>Ian Cady went away on 14 days Leave to get married. Hope his as Lucky as I was.</p>
<p>Sat. 9<br/>Had hot Bath after dinner and donned a clean change. After Tea went to Pelican Show with Bill Beard.</p>
<p>Got 2 Letters from B.E. dated Dec 28 and 30. "Tres bien" Letters too. That Girl seems to improve in every wry way as she gets older.</p>
<p>Sun. 11<br/>Glorious spring day. Just the sort of weather to go surfing.</p>
<p>Had a bad dose of Homesickness that I countered making up verses about B.E.</p>
<p>Bill Beard and I are on duty all day. Just our Luck.</p>
<p>Com. Letter No 12 to M.S.</p>
