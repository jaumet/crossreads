<p>Court again.  These Sikhs have a conspiracy of Silence, &amp; it is a slow biz dragging out evidence.  I rewrite all the evidence every night 2 hours work.<br/>I found tonight what can be found in many wealthy Eastern houses- An old English Governess who had been for <u>30</u> years in Egypt  She told many things about the rotteness of the Rich Pasha's homes, &amp; the way in which they endeavoured to Copy the English being the sincerest form of Flattery.<br/>Truth, Honesty-Morality are sadly lacking in Egypt &amp; they are quite unfitted to govern themselves.</p>
