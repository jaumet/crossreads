  
 26.3.16 To-night the sea looks very oily and it is dull and cold and I am quite expecting some more foul weather but we won't be very much longer in the Bight now and I hope we do call in at Fremantle it will be all I shall think about until we have definitely passed it. It is our day off duty to-day but instead of pleasing ourselves what we do (and especially as it is Sunday) we have had to fool round all the morning on "knotting and splicing" and of course did nothing but the idea was to keep us employed and this afternoon we had to sit on the deck and do absolutely nothing but wait for 5 o'clock and naturally we didn't take kindly to it. If the Officers only used a little bit of tact and brains things would be rather improved but it is wrong for me to talk as I can't get on well enough in my present position. There is no chaplain or Y.M.C.A. representative on board although we were promised one of each and on Sunday evening a man from the A.M.C. took  the  a service ans as he had experience in "slum work" in Sydney about 20 men listened to him in our mess room, the rest including myself laying in our hammocks and passing comments when necessary. Somehow I can't get on with these sort of services as they seem to have too much fervour and a suspicion of hypocrisy which I abhor. If I worship at all I prefer to do it in my own way and almost invariably alone. The sea has remained about the same in roughness and we were asleep by about 9 o'clock although it is said that some of the men stayed up till 3 in the morning gambling and it was made all the easier as the Engineers forgot to switch off our lights and did the same thing for the next two nights and made it rather difficult to sleep. The latest craze on board is for the men to try and grow hair on their face most of them attempting moustaches for future use but some of the more adventurous ones growing all sorts of shapes from sideboards to Captain Kettles
