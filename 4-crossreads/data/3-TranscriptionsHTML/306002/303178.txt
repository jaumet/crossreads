<p>5.6.15<br/>the heavy firing from the war-boats yesterday was that the French &amp; English troops made an attack &amp; advanced 400 yds.  The Turks lost heavily.  Matheson had the top of his head damaged this morning by a bullet.  I do not think the wound is serious.  We went on duty at 12 oclock to-day, a fairly quiet afternoon.  We have been been running foul of the Acting Quartermaster since "Jock" was shot (Cpl. Moylan) as he has been cutting our rations short.  When the attack was made last night we stood to arms for awhile but as we could see that we were not likely to be wanted, we returned to our dug-outs &amp; slept the sleep of the just.  I believe the Warspite was taking a hand in the bombardment yesterday.</p>
