<p>a difficulty is the same Maria. [Had] she grown rich the friends she has would have missed much fun, she would have grown fat and the mirth would long since have ceased to bubble forth.  Think you not so?</p>
<p>Mgr. Bon. Spagetti, of the delicacy, looks in his picture to be a jolly old cock, one who would be deposed if my prescription were accepted as the rule in the Roman Church, viz. that any man ever twelve stones in weight should have the bishop's robes taken from him, the averdupoise indicating that he is living luxurious days which is not correct for a bishop.   Old Marano would have been quite pleased with himself during the demonstration in front of his rooms in Macquarie Street.   I suppose that the Arch. and the rest were resplendent at the requiem Mass.   These affairs are always magnificent, too much so for me.</p>
<p>Yes the Labour people swept the poles in Queensland.  J. J. Ryan must be a Roman, because he was educated at the Jesuits college in Melbourne.

I hear from head quarters that the place is in bad repute, no wonder considering the rotters at the top.</p>
<p>Clever girl to be reading about Egypt, a country crammed full of interests that have been accumulating for at least eight thousand years.   I hope that some day you will have chance to come to see it, if I had sense enough to have stored by some money for a rainy day there had been no difficulty about the matter, but silly always in monetary affairs my life has been a failure in that regard.</p>
<p>The Australians at Galipoli were heroes of the first class, their behaviour was magnificent but it was not war.  Every man was a leader for himself and went on regardless of officers, the Australian way, all right if the other fellow is not waiting for you, but disastrous when the other fellow has a rifle which he knows how to use.</p>
<p>Your second bears date:  "West Maitland 31st May 15".   You were good to write when you were on holidays in Maitland.   Please thank Mrs. Silk for entertaing you.   My love to Rene.  I hope to get a run over to Galipoli before long.   I am growing a little</p>
