<p>Dear Alan.<br/>We have all heard with great excitement that you have volunteered for active war service and that your leaving for the front is not far off.</p>
<p>That "for the front" makes my heart go a bit pit a pat while I write it &ndash; not with fear I hope, but with the imaginations it pictures up of the great things being done there.</p>
<p>I myself am proud that you have chosen to go &ndash; a soldier in a right cause is always somewhere near what a man</p>
