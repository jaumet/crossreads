<p>prepared some time ago when the risk of a German advance was very great.  The whole country side looked well, crops in splendid condition but very few men to be seen.  Hazebrouck proved to be a fairly large place of the old type &amp; contained several hospitals.  I managed to purchase some English papers &amp; other little things &amp; some cigarettes &amp; delicacies from a British Canteen.  It was extraordinary the number of motor wagons I saw practically all of 3 tons capacity, the 30 cwt ones having been sent to Egypt.  They are all in squadrons, different makes being isolated to my mind a very good idea as it simplifies repairs &amp; replacements of parts etc.  In the evening went for a long walk &amp; came to a large wood principally of oaks.  Pathways ran through it at right angles, it being an ideal place for promenades as well as for preservation of games.</p>
<p>Thursday 6th July<br/>Went to 'Aire' in the car in order to procure supplies also had a run through the town &amp; had a look at the old church.  Aire is another old place it evidently being entirely run by the British as our men were</p>
