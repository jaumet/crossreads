  
 Willie Paul called in to see me, and you can bet that we had a good old yarn, as it was over three years since I saw him last. We were camped within fifty yards of each other for over a week & neither of us knew it. Nothing startling to report in regards our stay here, a little drill was done in the mornings, & the rest of the days we had to ourselves. I spent the time away by writing out the account of my Blighty Trip & attending a few Educational Classes. 
 Sunday 22nd September 1918. Memorial Service held in honour of L/Cpl Powell, L/Cpl. Hills, Charlie Whittaker & Jim Eldridge, by Corporal Cosier. It was indeed a most impressive Service, one that I shall never forget. I have never seen men break down as they did this night. 
 Monday 23 September 1918 - Friday the 26th September. Brigade Sports held today at Le Mesnil, as usual the 8th Field Ambulance was well represented, & we won a number of events. The famous 8th Brigade Band, which was on board the "Beltana" was in attendance & rendered excellent music. Came across Shenning & MacKenzie from Neutral Bay,  they were both well. In evening I went to the Coo-ees Pierrot Show, which was very good. Wild rumours afloat that very shortly we would be going into the Line again, & have a go at the Hindenburg Line, & then out we would go for our long promised rest.
