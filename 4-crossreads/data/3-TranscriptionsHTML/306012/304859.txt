<p>I got to Vintimiglia (French &ndash; Vintimille) at 1 a.m.  Here I changed my Italian money, bought a ticket to Paris and put my watch back one hour to French time.  At Mentone everyone had to get out of the train to have passports stamped.  I left the station and walked out in the early morning to the splendid British officers' convalescent hospital that has been established near Mentone (Cap Martin).  Finding that the chap I wanted to see had not arrived I took the Monte Carlo tram back to the gare and left by the rapide at 10 a.m. passing through Monaco, Monte Carlo, Nice, Cannes, Toulon etc., reaching Marseille at 6 p.m.<br/>I had purposely left Rome a day early to enable me to spend 24 hrs. in Marseille and I was soon busy looking up friends that I had not seen for two</p>
