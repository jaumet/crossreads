<p>a little purchasing for my voyage home. Stayed at the Jermyn Court Hotel.<br/><u>1st</u> Bought a mandolin amongst a number of other things with which to amuse myself on the homeward trip. Met Lts. Carrick and Dodimead in Fleet Street and Regent St. and the trio strolled off to the Paladium. I had to leave at half time to catch my train back to camp and dashed if I didn't bump into Eric Astridge and Frank Morely on the way down, both reporting to the 1 Camp at Warminster.</p>
