<p>Some of the other chaps had gone out to look for estaminets, they hadn't far to go, there was one next door.</p>
<p>They proceeded to drink Nuceiga[?] and made themselves drunk. One of them lay in the next bunk to me. I was awakened by the sound of vomiting and found him leaning over me. A lot got on my blankets, some trickled down on the man in the lower bunk.</p>
<p>I went out to look for little extras at the canteen. We were able to procure Golden Syrup and bread and of course that meant that we could have supper before going into bed.</p>
<p>I made my way into the kitchen of the farmhouse</p>
