<p>2 July 1915<br/>Friday</p>
<p>First thing this morning a large box kite was flown with a camera arrangement above our trenches, by some contrivance, papers were flown into the enemy's lines . The mountain gun of the evenings did considerable damage to Popes defences this morning so at 11.30 our "How is yer" baty opened fire with lyddite &amp; they created awful havoc in their trenches but somehow didnt manage to get the gun Our land &amp; sea guns started another heavy bombardment down at the Cape today &amp; its even heavier than the last.  A sniper was observed digging himself in at 6 on the Razor &amp; one of our m guns gave him a hand &amp; now he's not digging in.  Two of our planes came over tonight one dumped bombs &amp; the other reconittered the evenings position.  One sniper caught last night by the 1st LH &amp; found to have been armed with our rifle &amp; ammunition.  Another bomb (catapault) came over Courtneys tonight into a cook house &amp; wounded the cook</p>

<p>Heavy arty has been directed against us all day &amp; in return our howitzers have wrought awful havoc with lyditte in their trenches, they have dropped a few high explosives for distribution amongst us. The chaps down at the Cape have done splendid work &amp; have practically decimated two divisions of the army They attack as usual with arty &amp; infantry but this time in the broad daylight as that accounts for their huge losses they can now be seen from our position, from hill 701 at Anzac it is quite possible to see all over the country towards Gaba Tepe &amp; Achi Baba even the road along which their main supplies go is visible, camel trains one after the other can be seen at any hour of the day, also one of their HQs from which despatch riders are seen to come from every few minutes. All along the crest of Gaba Tepe dozens of troops can be seen, entrenching, &amp; others out in the olive grove where their arty is secreted. A mail arrived today &amp; I got 10 letters</p>
