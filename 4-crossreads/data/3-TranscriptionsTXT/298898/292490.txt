put in charge of the baths where all patients are washed as part of their treatment for scabies. Had a very busy day as we were late in getting a start on but tomorrow will be better. Weather on the mend. Had a congratulatory message from The Army Commander read out to us for our divisions fine work in the advance. The divisions mentioned were the 7th & the 4th & 5th Australian divisions, certainly they did do good work & at the end of a gruelling time in the line too.
Sunday 8th April Easter SundayHad a very busy day & could not get away to church altho' we had a service in the camp. Managed to get the day through with great success making my own system which will be further enlarged tomorrow. A beautiful day it being too warm to work in a tunic a vast change & almost unbelieveable.
