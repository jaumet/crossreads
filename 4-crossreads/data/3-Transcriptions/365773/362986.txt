<p>For two nights I didnt go to bed at all - I wouldn't have missed seeing London go mad for a Kings ransom - the streets were of course lighted up again &amp; people were marching round in processions flying flags playing weird instruments singing &amp; cheering - at about lam that night another Captain &amp; myself were caught up by a big procession in the forefront of which were Australians, we were hoisted shoulder high given Aussie flags &amp; to the tune of "Australia will be there" we paraded around Trafalgar Suare.<br/>The Colonel &amp; I went away for a week end for a spell on the 15th the pace being too hot, we returned to London on the 18th &amp; came straight on to here. More about this when I see you. You might shew Mother &amp; the Dad this letter please, with fondest love from your loving brother<br/>best love to B &amp; Ralph</p>
