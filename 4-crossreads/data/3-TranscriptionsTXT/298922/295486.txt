 "RAMADAN" 
 RAMADAN, 1 month of fasting for the Turksby day &amp; all MOSLEMS [indecipherable] tomorrow. They must not even drink water but they have a great spread at sundown &amp; feed all night &amp; if we let them will sleep by day. At the end of the month they are supposed to be most vicious &amp; best time for them to attack. Let 'em. 
 We had hopes of 1914 even getting leave to Australia but I see it can't be did. 
 Forgive the Blot but fountain Pens are erratic at times &ndash; fortunately, we always have sand to blot with.
