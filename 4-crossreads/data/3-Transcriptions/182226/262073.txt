<p>Sunday 20 February, 1916</p>
<p>Had the strangest church parade I have ever taken part in. It was in the midst of wind &amp; rain. We sang the first hymn &amp; then had to retire in a hurry because of the rain. We emerged however a few minutes later clad in our great coats &amp; went on from the general confession.</p>
<p>All our services are held in the open air with the regiment drawn up in hollow square. The Colonel &amp; adjutant sit in the centre with the officers in front in review order.</p>
