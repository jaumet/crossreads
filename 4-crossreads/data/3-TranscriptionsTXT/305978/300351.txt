back at out base camp about 6.30 pm we found it deserted, all the squadrons B,C, having gone out to help A squadron who had got into a gully & were cut off we the water gaurd were mad to think that we had just missed the fun, so tea was prepared & then rolled into bed.We met a dispatch rider just before we turned in & he told us that one of the areplanes had five holes drilled through her & that one missed the petrol tank by 1/2 inch it was a near shave for
