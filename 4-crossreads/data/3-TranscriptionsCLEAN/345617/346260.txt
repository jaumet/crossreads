Decembre 4Went to Steenwerk & Bailleul work shops & try & get some material. Most of the Section are still working on Corps Reserve & Support defences wiring etc. Set-back near Cambrai has not been so serious although a fair lineup of [indecipherable] - some guns which were turned against us & a good number of prisoners to the enemy.
Decembre 5Section nearly all out wiring. I have been in camp today just looking after a little more camp work. Haven't heard anything further from Cambrai.
