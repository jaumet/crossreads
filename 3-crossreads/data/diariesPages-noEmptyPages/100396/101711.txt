The beer here I am led to believe is very superior to that of Sydney. the chaps are lamenting the fact that it has gone up in price.
We have not done any rifle practice here yet 5 or 6 out of our Co only went to Williams? Town range. the rest of us are to go some day or other. From what I can hear the rifles are not sighted correctly. the fault being that they shoot to low. this fault can of course be overcome if one is careful, I think but it's a bad fault all the same. some of our chaps who went are marvellous shots one scored 3 points out of 80. others did very well considering I can't say how I will get along. no good for a cert.
It is now  to 7 a bugle band is trying to bust itself outside. the bugler calls sound very nice here at night since all the boys came. they begin about  a mile away gradually getting closer as the buglers of each batt. pick up the call, all the beauty goes from them when our chap starts. he is in the next line from us right behind our tent lights out the fall in are very unwelcome sounds.
Must stop now with love to All
