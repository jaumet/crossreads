<p>as well.  The Bee put a considerable quantity of coal overboard today for purposes of lightning the ship.</p>
<p>Saturday. Made an early start on towing off the Bee &amp; was successful cheer after cheer rang through the air as she slowly glided off the reef &amp; headed north  We followed passing through the same passage  one of the most beautiful pieces of scenery I have witnessed.  Rather a quaint feature was the mounds, red in colour caused by ants.  The vegetation was beautifully green &amp; reached to the waters edge except where a sandy beach interfered.  After a few hours sailing we reached Thursday Island which is a small island amongst many.  Very picturesque &amp; prosperous looking a large number of Pearl luggers busy at anchor.  We landed about six oclock &amp; strolled through the town  a mixed population Japs, Chows, Whites, Malays, niggers etc.  The town did a roaring trade &amp; several things were bought right out.  I fear there will be trouble  Quite a number of the men rushed the Hotels &amp; at one place of questionable character numbers of men six deep were waiting their turn.  We passed two small wrecks as we approached the island  My purchases included an Ice cream &amp; a soft drink which was most enjoyable  Have had rather a strenuous time.   Was awakened 3 A.M. Saturday morning by the guard bringing in a man suffering from Ptomaine</p>
