<p>me up to the roof &amp; there I saw hundreds of the enemy moving towards us over the ridges to the right &amp; left.  Away back towards Sain Kala were the moving people so I at once ordered boot &amp; saddle, sending Nicol with one gun to the left of the village.  Scott Olsen to the road in rear while the Chief, Brophy &amp; I with a gun took the left flank among the poplars.  Casey &amp; Place stayed with some of the Christians to load the mules while Cameron remained on look out.  Brophy &amp; I got the gun into position &amp; waited until 200 of the enemy got to the further edge of the plantation 600 yds away where they dismounted &amp; sat down.  I then turned 2 drums full into them knocking them &amp; their horses right &amp; left.  The crowd hurriedly departed leaving the right clear.</p>
