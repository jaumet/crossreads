<p>time.  Tell all our Friends not to waste money on parcels.  I've not had any for months &amp; months except the beauty that Mum sent with the 1 lb of butter in it.  I've not opened the butter yet.  I am saving it up until such time as butter runs short over here.  All the other things have gone long since.  I managed to get two tins of lemon &amp; melon jam (Australian) just a little while ago.  It is a treat &amp; did not cost very much money.  I went over to see an Eye-specialist a few days ago.  I had to get over to Head Quarters somehow.  I knew a chap over there.  I got a new pair of Boots, leggings and breeches.  That was why I wanted to see the eye-specialist.  Anyway my eyes are O.K.  I met 3 chaps over there who worked for D.J's.  They were "Webber's" Boys with me in the Shop &amp; we swept behind the counters &amp; picked bastes to-gether.  It is wonderful the fellows one meets.  Another chap I met was Bob</p>
