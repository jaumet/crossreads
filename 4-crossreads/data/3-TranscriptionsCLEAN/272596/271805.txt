flying fish & it was very pretty to see the way they leaped out of the water in their haste to get away.
Have started writing to home & various other people telling them not to expect me with this ship & also the full strength of my case. I am quite resigned now to the inevitable & must therefore make plans accordingly, thank heaven it won't be very long now before I am out of it for good, I am not going to waste much time on holidays once I get free I am going to combine business with pleasure & have a look round for the most suitable district to make a start possibly & possibly settle in for good for I have finished rambling & all I want is to settle down for good & finish, I think I can get a bit of help from Mitchell
