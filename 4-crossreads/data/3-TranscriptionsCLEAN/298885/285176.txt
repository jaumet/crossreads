 Bailleul is a fair sized town and much alike to all other towns here, with their numerous narrow streets all leading to the Square or market place in the heart of the town. 
 During our stay we had the opportunity of visiting the Cinema and Concert Hall which are always very much enjoyed by the boys as they are not to be had very often. 
 Nov 24th - 17 Setting out at 9.30AM we left Bailleul behind by walking to Doullieul 
 A nice enjoyable walk
