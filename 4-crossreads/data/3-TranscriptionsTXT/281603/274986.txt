 August 1916 
 It was while encamped at No. 1 Anzac reinforcement camp Val-de-Maison that my second year on active service opened on 23rd August 1916.  On the afternoon of the 22nd the Battalion had to attend a Brigade parade at La Vicogne at which Gen Birdwood presided &amp; decorated officers &amp; other ranks with awards won in the recent fighting at Pozieres the second time.  Next day the 24th, the Battalion lined up &amp; marched to Gezaincourt where we stayed for a couple of days.  On the 25th I walked to Doulens a distance of about a mile &amp; a half &amp; had a look around the town which is a fine big place &amp; it was here where we entrained the next day.  At 4 am on the 26th I had to march with a party to the railway at Doulens as guide on the train for my platoon &amp; it was at 5am when the platoon entrained but never moved till 6.30am &amp; we went in a northerly direction till we arrived at Coperinghe in Belgium our destination.  We disentrained at 1 pm &amp; formed up into column &amp; had about a three mile march to Toronto Camp where we stayed in huts.  On the 27th I received a rise in rank &amp; was made Temporary Corporal.  On the 28th I was detailed as Battalion orderly corporal &amp; it was my first experience at that kind of work &amp; the battalion also marched to Poperinghe that day &amp; had a hot bath &amp; change of under clothes.  At 11 pm on the 29th the Gas alarm was given &amp; when it was found that everything was clear I was detailed of as corporal of gas guard &amp; dismounted at 6am next morning.  It was late in the afternoon of the 30th that the Battalion lined up ready to move off to the firing line &amp; we marched to a siding north of Poperinghe where we entrained.
