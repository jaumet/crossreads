 on the dive gaug . This meant that the after part of the boat and the top of the bridg were show abov water . This was inde alarm as we were surround by fort . We could hear the shell strike the water and burot outsid . At this stage the Captain Stoker told us to remain cool and all would go well . He then look through the periscop and saw that we were be fire on from all side ( it was onli a miracl that we were not hit ) . After the Captain had a quick look around , he gave the order to go full speed ahead . We were soon delight to see by the depth gaug that we were move off into deep water and we were soon down to 80 feet , as if noth had happen . ( Dure all this the Captain remain extrem cool , for all depend on him at this stage . It is due to his cool that I am now write this account . Nobodi know what a terribl strain it is on the nerv to undergo anyth like this , especi the Captain , as all depend on him . When we show our periscop again we were off Point Nagara the Captain look astern saw that we were be follow and ahead of us were two tug come which evid had a sweep out to tri and catch us , but we immedi went down to 90 feet and alter cours to starboard to keep well clear of the tug . We kept on this cours and ran into a big bay on the Asiatic side just abov Point Nagara , the Captain look through the periscop , saw that we had misl our enemi , not have suffici electr left in our batteri to take us into the sea of Marmora the onli thing we could do was to lay on the bottom and wait till nightfal when we could come onto the surfac and charg our batteri . After the Captain was certain that we had not been seen , we went into the bottom at 8.30 a.m ( 25.4.15 ? ) and lay there at a depth of 95 feet . After this we fell in for read of prayer , it be Sunday . When ship do not carri a Chaplain the Captain doe the duti . After this a watchkeep was told off to watch the dive gaug and report ani nois on the outsid of the boat ( for when a submarin is submerg everi sound can be heard from the outsid , a ship can be heard pass over-head the screw and the throb of the engin . The remaind of us were told we could sleep as we were all dead tire , have been up near all the previous night . At 2 p.m. the hand were call and put to dive station and prepar were made to rise to the surfac to see what was go on . When we move our screws( we must have been lie on the edg of a bank ) the boat sank down to a great depth . This was veri danger as the thin skin [of] a submarin is onli built to stand a certain pressur of water , the dive gaug are onli made to regist to 100 feet and on this occas our gaug was hard over and the needl of the gaug bend so we did not know what depth we went down to but it was a veri close thing . Howev we got suffici air pressur into our main ballast bank to [ Note at side of page " Perhap this is what happen to AE2 but think he mean AE1.]
