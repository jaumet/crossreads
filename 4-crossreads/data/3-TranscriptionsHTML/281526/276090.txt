<p>28/1/18 London<br/>Found that beyond a few questions there was nothing interesting being done in the House and a debate commenced on National Registration which soon emptied the house and galleries. Dined at a little caf&eacute; near Victoria Station and then back to Hotel. About 9 p.m. an air raid commenced and the guns opened up briskly. The people in the hotel congregated on the stairs. No wonder they get the wind up &ndash; I looked out of my top window and a dud descended too close to be comfortable so I went down to the ground floor. Could hear the aeroplane engines quite plainly and also the sound of falling bombs. Turned in at about 10 p.m.</p>
