When the casualties came into the hospital later I believe the nurses were nearly in Hysterics, Big, Rough, Anzacs were on being stripped for treatment etc, Disclosed the daintiest of Silk nighties, knickers, even Silk Stockings. There were yards of pale Blue & Pink ribbons run through these garments and Altogether the nurses nearly broke their hearts over the sinfull waste I believe the Nurses grabbed the discarded clothing for their own use.   G.L. to Mac
28/7   Fritz planes very busy last night Bombing all around here. He caught the Yanks in Allonville Wood, killed at least 10 & wounded a number of others.
Letter to Ciss 31.7.18
1.8.18 The Ubiquitous Fritz has just brought down 4 of our Observation Balloons all in a row All w we have to show now is 4 columns of black smoke and 6 Parachutes tossing about on their way to Earth with the unfortunate observers. There are generally two on with each Balloon & there are only 6 coming down. Two of the Balloons must have had only one observer each or else two were Killed by the attacking planes. The Balloons on this sector have been getting a bad time lately.
Ted Welsh came back from Blighty today. There is a run rumor that we are going to shift. About 40 Tanks went up to the line last night. There must be a Stunt coming on. Fritz is very uneasy. His reconnaissance planes were over today several Times.
