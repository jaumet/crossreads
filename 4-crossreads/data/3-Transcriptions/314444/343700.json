<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Recieved your very welcome letters dated 18 April. I also recieved one from Dorothy dated 1 May, so I expect yours along any day. I recieved also a nice parcel of cigarettes from Miss Brown, which were very welcome. I am enclosing a letter to her, please address, Miss Maude Brown 234a Alfred St North Sydney. I hope you are all keeping good health. I am in tip top health &amp; feeling as fit as a fiddle. We are enjoying good weather. Everything is looking nice and green It is much nicer than the bare land as it was a few months ago. You should be recieving a nother photo of me. hope you like it.<br/>I hope this big Russian offensive has some thing to do with the ending of the war. Possibly we may be home for Xmas. I do hope so. I had some more letters &amp; parcels from Aunt Florrie. She is very kind to me.<br/>Hoping you are all well. Best wishes and love &amp; kisses</p>
<p>Your loving Son</p>
