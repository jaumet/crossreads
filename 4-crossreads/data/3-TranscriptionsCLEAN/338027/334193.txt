  
 Friday, 14 June, 1915 A few days ago a German aeroplane came over and dropped bombs in the French & Greek Camp without doing any damage. The Greeks were very indignant and some ran amok and did serious damage amongst the Turkish prisoners of who we have a lot here.  the next camp to us is the R.A.M.C. and adjoining them are the Indians, it is a curious thing that they have a separated fence for the cooks as if a white man's shadow falls on their food they throw it away. Things are very quiet at Gaba Tepe but they are slowly advancing at Cape Hellas.  every day we receive sick men from the trenches, it is reported that enteric fever has broken out badly at Gaba Tepe.   a few nights ago we attacked Achi Baba without avail but the Turks lost 23,000 men & yet it did not fall. 
 Saturday, 12 June. The Col & party returned to-day from Gaba Tepe and brought some mail back, they relate all sorts of adventures and we are told that the Col showed disgusting cowardice under fire, he refused an offer to take charge of the evacuating zone of an Inf Bde preferred to have his corp scattered.   The greatest surprise of the lot was when he brought back our W.O. S.M. Lacy, the last we saw of him was that he was in a hospital at Heliopolis, but in the meanwhile getting better.  he returned to the front and worse luck back to us.  They are still steadily advancing from Cape Hellas but all is quiet at Anzac which has been named for those that are holding it, Aust N.Z. Army Corp.
