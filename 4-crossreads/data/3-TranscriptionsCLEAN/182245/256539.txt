 1917 JANUARY 
 24 WEDNESDAY 
 Fine & sunny & fairly warm in 
 the sun. Cleaning harness 
 all day. There was a lot of 
 aircraft about & they were 
 firing at them all day but 
 did not bring any down as far 
 as I could see. Our section 
 was on duty, but could not 
 get any ammunition to 
 take up, so we did not have 
 to go out. Got some more 
 socks ect from 7 th  Bde 
 comfort fund. I was on 
 stable picket at night.
