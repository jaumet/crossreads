In the Church of Sepulchre is the bell that used to be rung by the watchman in front of the condemned cell at Newgate what time a doggerel was recited [indecipherable] flames of hell and true repentance etc. it was also a custom of this church to hand a bunch of flowers to each criminal as he made his way towards his death at Tyburn. Boards inside the church tell of record bell ringing done there. 5031 change rung in 3  hours recently. The walls of all these old places are covered with dingy tablets and mural monuments.

To Horseferry Road and there saw Major Cross received 3 weeks leave. Civilian in warrant room drew up trip arranged to leave for Scotland on the morrow. Back to hospital packed up then taxied in to Kings Cross Hotel (Item 7/21) To Elysee (Leicester Square) for afternoon tea and received much glad eye. Pouring rain returned to hotel and took things easy. About 9.36 went out to have a look at the night side of London and found it very hard to find the way about owing to the pitch darkness of the streets of a Zeppelins. This very darkness is a premium to vice and the solicitation in Piccadilly Circus Leicester Square is worse than anything I have ever seen while chemist shops flaunt rubber goods etc with electric signs
