About half past ten we pulled up at  a big station. Here we were issued with Tea Rations, Wrighty Aldis, and I walked along to the platform where we discovered a buffet, where one could buy almost anything. Bread, Chocolate, Tobacco, Cakes wine, beer etc., We bought some Bread and cakes and had a glass of wine or two, and also took a couple of bottles of wine back to the carriage, where we had a most enjoyable feed.
