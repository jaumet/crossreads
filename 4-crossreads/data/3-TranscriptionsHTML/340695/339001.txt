<p>11-8-17 Moved to DRANOUTRE Belgium by Motor Lorry I came up with the Skipper in the Napier it is not very far from STERNWENCK. The folk speak English splendidly &amp; are particularly nice to us where we mess. We are the first Australians to be billeted with them.<br/>12-8-17 Reninghelor is not far from here so I borrowed the Skipper's horse &amp; set out to find my Belgian Lassie at the farm there. (Ha) A glorious ride &amp; found my quarry but she was not at the farm. Received a great welcome at the hands of her sisters &amp; enjoyed the products of the farm. My pony was greatly admired. Arrived back safely just before a fierce storm broke loose.<br/>15-8-17. Mac went on leave yesterday his second time am waiting anxiously for mine.</p>
