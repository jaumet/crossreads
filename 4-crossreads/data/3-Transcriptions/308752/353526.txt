<p>December 18th 1918 to December 23rd 1918.    [Again this should be "1917"]<br/>The village is certainly a "dead &amp; alive" place &ndash; contains a Church &amp; can boast of a couple of Estaminets.  We were all disappointed at coming to a place, like this, &amp; the Unit is distributed all over the village. The Orderly Room is very comfortable, is in a two roomed cottage &amp; contains, a big open fire place, in which we had some roaring fires at times.</p>
<p>After being here a few days we liked the place much better &amp; the French inhabitants are a most obliging folk. In fact we have never been treated so well before by the French, quite a different class of people to those of the Somme district.</p>
<p>The weather has been exceptionally cold lately, frosty weather has set in, the snow has been lying on the ground, for over a week. Now &amp; again a little snow balling took place, which is great sport.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve. 1917.<br/>It is hard to realize, that my third Christmas away from Australia is at hand. The village was "scoured" &amp; scores of ducks, geese, &amp; fowls, were purchased for Christmas Dinner. Three marquees have been erected so some good times are in store for the Unit.</p>
