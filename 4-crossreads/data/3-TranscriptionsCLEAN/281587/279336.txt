  
 of this old place.  This is a twelfth century building also, erected by the native Christians on the ruins of an old Roman fort.  The road we travelled when we finally got a start on with the transport was rough in the extreme.  It knocks our horses about terribly.  We took the road which branches off from the main Jaffa to Jerusalem road, just above the village of Saris and immediately before coming into sight of El Enab, which lies just round the bend.  Almost immediately after starting we halted to allow the transport to straighten itself out, and could see it  scramble  wending away up the rocky hill in front, the horses scrambling and stumbling among the loose stones, and straining at the traces. 
 Just here on our left, is a comparatively new building, with what is a most rare sight here, a galvanized iron roof.  What it is I do not know.  It was quite an hour before all the transport in front had moved and we began the ascent up towards Nebi Samwil, the highest mountain in this part of the Country. The journey was a series of halts.  The limbers most of them overloaded, had their burdens shaken off at frequent intervals, and the road being so narrow, each time this occurred, the whole of the transport would have to wait. 
 This occured several times with us, and then, going down one big hill, our brake broke, so finding a place where we could turn to the side of the road, we pulled our team over, unloaded, and then reloaded afresh.  By this time the Artillery transport had possession of the road, and we could not have got onto it had we tried without breaking their column, so we fed up, boiled the billy and had dinner ourselves of Maconochies.  This is an excellent ration of meat and vegetables, and far superior to, and more liberal than bully beef.  There must be going to be a great stunt up in these hills this time.  For an hour and more a seemingly endless stream of big guns and gun limbers passed us, the biggest display of artillery I have seen here
