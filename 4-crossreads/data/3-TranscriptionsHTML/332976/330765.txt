<p>10th   I went out again to-night with the infantry fatigue &amp; continued with the duck-walks for about another 100 yds.<br/>At about 8 o'clock Fritz bombarded us pretty heavily with H.Es &amp; Schrapnell &amp; we had to clear out.  A party of Pioneers who had passed us a few minutes before caught it rather bad.<br/>It has been very clear to-day &amp; Fritz has been giving the parties going "in" and "out" a hot time.  There have been a fair number of casualties &amp; he got eight direct hits on the duck walk track during the day</p>
