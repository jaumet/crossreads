  
 We had just turned into the entrance of the station when a big shell exploded right in the centre of the Station Yard which was already crowded with troops waiting to entrain. I felt the splinters flying past me & I was 50 yards from the burst - I have no idea how many it got 
 The order was given to clear the station & we marched off down the road till the shelling was over - We  waited  halted there till long after dark - bitterly cold & raining & did not entrain till about midnight in pitch blackness -
