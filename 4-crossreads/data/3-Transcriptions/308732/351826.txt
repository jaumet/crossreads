<p>7/6/17 We left Berteaucourt this morning about 9 o'clock and marched towards Amiens, don't know how far we came but it is to a place named Bertangle. I was lucky enough to get kept behind to take a man up as a prisoner, and we got a ride on a motor-lorrie most of the way, and was not sorry, as the roads which are very narrow, has two constant streams of traffic, men, guns, and lorries going up towards the line, &amp; empty lorries &amp; refugees going back &amp; the road is inches deep in a fine white dust, &amp; through all the traffic are motorcycles going both ways, apparently as hard as they can, and when the road runs thro' a village and mingled in among the other traffic are lots of children &amp; women, &amp; poultry, etc. I don't know how it is that there are not more accidents, everyone on the road is thickly coated with the white dust. While I am writing this there is a Fritz aeroplane right up over head, thousands of feet, and with the sun shining on him, he looks like a great bird. Guns are booming</p>
