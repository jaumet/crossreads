On arrival we completed with coal.

The next trip to sea was for the purpose of carrying out exercises, in conjunction with the Grand Fleet. 
Feb. 28
These passed off without incident, & we returned after a few days to our base, again completing with coal & oil fuel.  About this time a raider (German) attmpted to break the blocade, & get out into the Atlantic.  One raider, named the "Mo&euml;we" had escaped from the patrols previously, & she had succeeded in sinking several ships in the Atlantic.  However, this raider called "Grief" was caught in the act, & engaged.  We lost the "Alcontara", an armed merchantman, but she succeeded in sinking the raider first.  This episode was kept strictly quiet, so that the German Admiralty would be kept quite ignorant of the actual state of affairs.

One day the Fleet was hurriedly ordered to sea, in order to intercept a strong German fleet which had been reported steaming North from the Dutch island of Terschelling.  As soon as we weere out of harbour this information was piped along the mess deck, & was greeted with tremendous enthusiasm by the men.
