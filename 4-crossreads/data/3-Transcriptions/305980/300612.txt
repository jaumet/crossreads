<p>9:  N.Z. trooper shot dead by Bedouin who was stealing gear from the tent.  Buried in N.Z. cemetery this afternoon.</p>
<p>10:  Men of N.Z. D. raided the Bedouin village, as the inmates refused to hand over the murderer after getting 24 hours warning.  36 Bedouins killed, but all women, children &amp; aged men were taken from the village before the raid was carried out.  Picquet is now armed, as the natives have been thieving from our camps for the past week.  The villages were burnt down during the raid &amp; nobody could interfere, as it was properly organised by the N.Z. men.</p>
