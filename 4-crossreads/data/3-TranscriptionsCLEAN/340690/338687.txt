  
 Gillett, & Toogood arrived at 5.30 loaded with champagne from cellars in Caestre all fairly drunk.  We all had several drinks before moving and carried rest.  Marched down to headquarters and got paid and marched on to Caestre and I was left on one corner as guide till sections went through.  Amusing sight watching Australians & Frenchman going in all directions loaded with champagne.  Same 5 badly drunk and Jensen called on Kernot for assistance.  Some excitement with Toogood and Kernot broke several of their bottles on way out.  I followed on with No. 3 with Gillett who was badly drunk.  All No. 3 had bottles and infantry gave away champagne lavishly.  I got two and Edmonds 2 but I dropped one of mine unnoticed and lost it.  On skirting Fletre on left to No. 3 billet in a farm house and Bremner afterwards took us to No. 2 who were digging in by a hedge on sloping ground.  All N.C.O's bar Groth, myself & Linton gone out to front.  Gillett a sore trial and Stott, Strain & Endersby only came along later.  I was left in charge as Groth incapacitated and had to make an extra dugout and clean up before daybreak.  Cooks in farm below us.  Got everything fixed fairly well
