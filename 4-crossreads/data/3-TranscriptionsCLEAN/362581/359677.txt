 Have heard that you   &  Mummie had a holiday   &  stayed with Auntie Annie at Talbot. How did you enjoy it! Had some fun, I guess. Hope you are well   &  strong now also going to school. We are having warm weather now but it is lovely after the cold weather. Fondest love   &  kisses  From  Auntie Eadle.
