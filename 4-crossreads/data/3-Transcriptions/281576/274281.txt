<p>Menin Road<br/>Tues. Sept. 25 (cont)  We got out to Hooge Tunnel without further loss.  The motor lorries were all ablaze, &amp; we got past them at the "toots" as they were such a good mark for Fritz. &amp; he put his "big stuff" over thick &amp; heavy.  There were plenty of wounded coming thro &amp; we were kept busy.  Just near where poor Phil got knocked was "Hell Fire Corner" &amp; never was a place better named.  We had to carry about 1&frac12; miles to the A.D.S. past the burning lorries &amp; to add to the excitement, a dump caught fire, &amp; Mills Bombs &amp; cartridges were banging away in all directions.  Bullecourt  was bad enough, but it was a "Home" compared to this sport.  One of our squads composed of Bill Hippersley, Lew Ballard, Mat Doyle, &amp; Henry Mercer, got about 50 yds away from out dug out with a Patient, when a shell dropped among them.  It blew poor old Mat &amp; Lew &amp; the patient to pieces,</p>
<p>Hooge Tunnel &amp; Crater</p>
<p>blew one of Henry's legs off, &amp; slightly injured Bill Hippersley.  Poor old Mercer died soon after reaching the dressing station.  Soon after this "Towny" got his right hand badly smashed.</p>
<p>Our list of casualties was getting very high.  It was a great relief to get back to our Tunnel as it was very strongly built &amp; one felt fairly safe inside it.  It was built by the Germans &amp; runs along for about 5 miles.  Fritz used to bring his troops along it at one time.  In places it is blown in, &amp; now forms a series of very serviceable dug-outs.  Owing to so many casualties we had plenty of rations.  Wyn Arthur was the next to get a "souvenir" from Fritz.  A small piece of shrapnel hit him in the shoulder.  It was not serious &amp; after they had dressed him at the A.D.S. [Advanced Dressing Station] they sent him back to duty, as we were so short of men.</p>
