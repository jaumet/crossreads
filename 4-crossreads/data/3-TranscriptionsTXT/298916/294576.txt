Numerous telegraph operators from the Post Office &amp; amateur wireless fiends joined the class &amp; in a few days the class being full it was closed. The classroom was a floor, above the offices &amp; had a number of long tables arranged, with a telegraph key at one end &amp; a number of plug sockets underneath. One operator would sit at this key &amp; transmit at an even pace &amp; the others, by plugging a pair of telephones into a socket would hear the operator's transmitting in the form of a buzz similar to wireless signals. The system being worked on an inductive principle it was easy to vary the strength of the signals, which were gradually reduced in strength as the operators progressed until they assumed wireless signals under severe atmospherical conditions. To further qualify the operators, the systems were inter-connected so as to have one or more sets of signals being produced in the phones at once &ndash; a confusing way until one could read one without letting the others interfere. The tables were arranged also with operators of different speeds so that
