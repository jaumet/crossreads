<p>28/1/16<br/>Reveille at 0545. Breakfast 0600. All tents struck at 0630 and packed on trucks which were drawn by horses out to Railhead. &ndash; a dead end out in the sand. All other heavy baggage taken out similarly. The Battalion marched out fully equipped and left the camp site as bare as a match at 0900, advanced guard furnished by "B" Co, the rear guard by the 21st. Battn. This was our first "dinkum" march in hostile country with an advanced guard out against a real enemy. They remained but after we reached our destination until the outposts were well in position.</p>
<p>The men were very heavily laden with all their worldly goods, blankets 150 rounds of ammunition and big packs. We found the going very heavy the desert sand coming almost over the boot tops. At first we tried 50 minute marches but the pace was too killing and eventually we were marching 15 minutes and then halting ten. By the time the halt came many were staggering along with open mouths gasping and several times men staggered out of the ranks and fell sprawling face downwards in the sand right out to it. The calculation in text books that an infantryman can do his 3 miles 720 paces per hour does not hold good on service in the desert. We traversed in all about 9 miles and this took us from 0900 to 1600 &ndash; the men on reaching camp just pitching forward dog tired.</p>
<p>During one halt while all were getting breath one remarked "This soldiering is a fair b&mdash;" His mate "Why, Joe, think what tales you'll be able to tell your grandchildren of your campaign marches!" "No good to me", was answer I'll never be able to have any grandchildren after this".</p>
<p>R.S.M Porter &amp; Peart just about knocked out.</p>
