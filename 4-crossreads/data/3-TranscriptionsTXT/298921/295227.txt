September, 1915Monday 13Accommodation here excellent but Nile water objectionable - Each Room is well furnished have a little Balcony - Electric light & Radiators, telephone etc all as a first class Hotel.I have met numbers of the old Regiment & Officers I knew; The gardens surrounding are Rockeries & Terraces & small Gazelle or Duikers (little deer) as we called them in South Africa play about - It is a peaceful spot & a man should forget the nightmare of the "Deadmans Ridge" for a time.Travelling out here one is struck by the Advertisements on Platforms all in 3 languages - French, English & Arabic one above the other - (expensive)
