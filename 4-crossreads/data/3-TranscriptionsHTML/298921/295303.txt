<p>10 December Friday 1915<br/>I remember thinking a man was living a hum drum existence on the station but Riverina except in the middle of February perhaps is a Paradise to Egypt &amp; what a clean living country Australia is compared to these parts!! Certainly this cannot be called Humdrum, but it is a bit monotonous being so cramped up. Digging is the chief occupation by Day &amp; watching by night.<br/>I have just been ironed a pair of Pants (Slacks) like all soldiers clothes a rotten fit why is it that Pyjamas in the Hospitals &amp; so on are <u>cut</u> in such Comic fashion &ndash; However the Pants are clean &amp; as we sleep &amp; live in clothes a change is good.</p>
