<p>2 June, Monday</p>
<p>F.<br/>We work very hard. Beds very difficult to make. All troops come aboard after dinner. I meet Dick Coutnay &amp; McLachlan from D.J's &amp; Burwood. We move our quarters on to a higher deck, it is bon. The numerous war craft in the Harbour would beat any German navy. We see the "Somali: go out.</p>

<p>3 June, Tuesday</p>
<p>F.<br/>Just catch someone pulling up the gangway to post letters. We put out at 9 am amidst great cheering &amp; band playing "Auld Lang Syne &amp; Rule Britannia". We lay out in stream all day until just 5 pm. I work all day in Ward. Sisters seem to be very good. See Eddystone Lighthouse. King's Birthday &amp; salutes are fired. See hugh seaplane. Go to bed early pretty tired. We have boat drill but I don't go on.</p>
