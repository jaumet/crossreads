31/1/17.
Moved up to the front line at "Yarra Bank". Went onto a post in No Mans Land. Have to creep over the snow to it for there are no trenches. A hun post is only 40 yards away on our right front. We are clearly visible to each other. Because of these peculiar circumstances the sector has become neutral. The Germans try to make friendly demonstrations; one played a whistle and the other sang softly last night. No hostile demonstration was made by either side last night his rations approached, searching over the snow and singing vociferously to a point not a hundred yards away. Our carrying parties were similarly exposed I never expected to see this; but everyone is too busy keeping warm to worry about the war in this exposed position. There is no mud the whole country
