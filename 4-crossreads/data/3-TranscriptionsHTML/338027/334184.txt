<p>Monday, 24 May, 1915<br/>More patients arrived on board to-day mostly cases that are being sent back to Alexandria for treatment.  I got the bulk of them, have now 46 to look after.  The Allied fleets are steadily forcing the Dardanelles but Constantinople is a long way off yet.  It is the general optimism now that the British bit off more than they can chew in assaulting Gaba Tepe without more Navy preparation and Headquarters are being blamed for the heavy loss of Australians as they had no reinforcements and therefore had to retire over three miles of won ground, if reinforcements had been there the rest would have been much easier also they would have had the guns that are doing the damage now, the Aust has won the title of the White Gurkhas even the original acknowledge this, they are cruel, heartless fighters but worth two Tommies when fighting the Turks, the British are very jealous of our success.</p>
