<p>Train bound for Perth, Several nice Scotch People joined me &amp; at 9.15 am, the Train started, &amp; I had a very enjoyable ride passing through: a lot of Rocky Fern Country with beautiful Scenery in the distance, a number of large Brick Works were passed en route &amp; Gardens which all had a large plot of Rhubarb growing also Raspberries, the High Hills with large Towns with the tall Smoke Stacks looked very nice, we passed through the districts of Larbert, Bannockburn &amp; Stirling were we stayed 15" &amp; off again passing over the Allan River to Dumblane &amp; after 1 hours run the Train steamed into Perth on time viz 11-40 am where I had a Cup of Tea &amp; a Sandwich at the Welcome Barrow, after obtaining particulars of the whereabouts of the Soldiers &amp; Sailors Home, I passed out of the Station &amp; up over a Bridge &amp; in a few minutes arrived at the Home where I booked a Bed for the night, &amp; after a Brush Up, I took a Train, which are very old fashioned &amp; quite a contrast to the Glasgow Trains</p>
