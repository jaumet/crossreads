right at the end of the Harbour. C,F,G, H Companies got served out with 150 rounds a man 36 hours rations, the Sailors had gone ashore early from the Yarra, 25 men had gone up towards the Signal station had met opposition, some Red cross men had also gone with the sailors, while we were waiting to go ashore in the ships boats, some of the wounded came alongside germans as well as our own men, altogether we lost about 10 or 12 Killed Wounded, Dr Pockley being shot through the stomach died two hours afterwards, being buried that same night along with other men who got killed. At 5.30 pm we landed in full marching order, loaded our magazines marched up to the Wireless station, going slowly as when we were near to where the shots were flying flopping through the Cocoanut trees through which we were passing it was nearly dark, when we arrived to within  mile off the Wireless station, our men had got in touch with the enemy, we having scouts out dodging from Tree to Tree (the main body keeping to the roads) scouts out on either flank, we came across 7 Germans who surrendered gave up their arms we shot a few niggers who were perched up in Cocoanut Trees, now as it was dark we halted, then word came that the Germans had surrendered, but as we afterwards found out only a few did, the others slipping off in the darkness opposed us later on. Colonel Watson said nothing more could be done now so we marched back again to Herbertshohe camped on the ground round one of the houses there; 7 german prisoners being in one of the rooms guarded by sentries, one at the door one at each window with fixed bayonets, the officers had the other rooms in the house all of us camped either under the House or round, I lay down right in front of the house along with two others of my section we were being sniped at now
