 Tuesday 31 Tonight I spent very pleasantly, in a old Pozieres gathering Docker & Barnby & also James & Robby were there & we had a good talk over old times. I don't know, but in spite of paper talk etc I think peace movements are getting a hold. 
 August, 1917 Wednesday 1 If this country & the people are realizing the utter absurdity of driving Germany out of Belgium & France. Soon too, think we will compromise with Germany perhaps this year, as an outcome of this peace feeling. Wattle day at home Third battle of Ypres began yesterday & has been made out to be a huge success.  What are our casualties in these stunts? 
 Thursday 2 Change in the weather which up to yesterday was beautiful is now wet cold & windy. Three very interesting lectures this morning on "Economy in War Time" principally. Also on the eternal topics. 
 Friday 3 To go by coach with Dock & Barnby to Salisbury tomorrow. 
 Saturday 4 Salisbury trip cried off on account of bad weather & Barnby not being able to come.
