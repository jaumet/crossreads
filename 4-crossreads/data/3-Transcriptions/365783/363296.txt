<p>the photos I left there for you I wish you would also get printed the negative of Margaret &amp; Tingsey sitting on the verandah of their little house &amp; of the groups that I took at the Beach.   I'm not sure where I put them but I fancy they are in the surgery in the drawer under the instrument case or on the top of the enamelled wash stand. Don't bother too much about finding them.<br/>I would also like a photo of Father &amp; Mother those that are in the surgery will do unless they have more recent ones. I suppose you have had the proofs of my photo from Cruden hope they were decent but I was feeling pretty miserable when they were taken</p>
