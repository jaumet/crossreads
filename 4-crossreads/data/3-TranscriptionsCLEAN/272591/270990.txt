last year at Moulle - in France. After leaving War Chest walked to Leicester Sq. In Whitehall saw a tablet near United Services Museum showing the  spot situation of scaffold for Charles 1st. in Leicester Sq went to Withers - violin experts - & asked them about my violin. The name inside is that of a well-known German bow-maker. They say violin would be of no particular value. The name is C.G. Pfretzs-chner. After leaving there went up St Martins Lane to Seven Dials - passing the Coliseum on the way. Then went along Great Earl St to Old Compton St & into Soho - walking about several streets in that district. Came back along Shaftesbury Avenue, Charing Cross Rd, Chandos St, & Strand to Aldwych Hut where I had dinner. This morning also went into Downing St & saw No 10 - the Prime Minister's residence.
