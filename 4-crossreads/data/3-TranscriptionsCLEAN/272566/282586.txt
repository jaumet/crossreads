 Lovely day. Preparations for moving all morning.  Marched out at 3 p.m. a distance of 11/2 miles to Bapaume to the same place we occupied when first entering Bapaume last March.  Now living in a tent.  Twilight lasts till about 11 o'clock.  When "Lights Out" is blown on the bugle the sun hasn't gone down by that time.
