<p>To-day Sunday 26th I went to see the village of Wylye in daylight &amp; I was considerably impressed with its nice appearance. It is a nice old fashioned English village, Most of the houses are very old with thatched roofs which are over grown with green moss, which tend to give the places a very comfortable &amp; homely appearance. A small stream runs through the village near the railway station end. This stream supplies the motive power to the flour-mill which is built across it in one place. The village church is a very old historical building, It was built in the year 1200 when the place was in the possession of the Normans. One hundred years after the place was built the first rector was installed there. I went back to the camp for tea &amp; turned in to bed early.</p>
<p>The following day the 27th I was paraded to the doctor for inoculation</p>
