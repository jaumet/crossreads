<p>less than fifty yards from one another.  It is not truly wonderful?   An anecdote is told of a certain major who was called by his men, made Major S.   He said, When I beat the kerosene tin three times you will charge.  He did beat the tin.  His men up and charged, and when along the road to the enemy things became hot the gallant major dropped into a gun pit and waited till the affair was over.   'Tis thus the words were spoken to me.</p>
<p>Every man stands ready with fixed bayonet at about four o'clock each morning because it is at that hour the attacks are expected, every fourth or sixth man keeps careful watch while the others are almost as equally as ready as he.<br/>The trenches all communicate with one another, and each can be walked into from many directions.  Telephones heliographs and flags are working all the time, by their means information is kept constantly travelling from one point to another.   Lemnos is all sandstone.   Galipoli is good growing land much of which is cultivated.</p>
<p>The enemy never fires his guns at night because the positions might be discovered; they also cease firing when the aeroplanes or the balloons are in the air, to prevent those watching from above discovering them as targets for the guns upon the ships.  Luminous shells and flares are often thrown into the air at night and they are frequently followed by hand grenades.   Both sides use these.  The fuses are so arranged as to allow of a man counting three and then throwing the tin or what else it may be.   It is said that one was given to a stuttering soldier to throw, he counted on-e, tw-o, th--r-ee, off went the bomb and his head with it.  Some what unfortunate I hear you say.</p>
