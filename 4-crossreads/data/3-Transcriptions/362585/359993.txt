<p>France<br/>26.2.17</p>
<p>Dear mater,</p>
<p>I hereby beg to acknowledge receipt of socks pairs two &amp; magazines cartoons one.</p>
<p>Fritz is on the fun, &amp; we, unfortunately, are out of the line having a  <strike></strike> rest.  Lord help him when <u>we</u> start.  Note the personal touch in the we.</p>
<p>Don't know whether you are receiving my cables which leave here regularly week by week.  Letters also flow continuously from my labouring pencil.  (You thought I was going to say pen) &amp; no doubt  <strike></strike> reams of uninteresting literature are helping to swell the libraries of countless Goanti-Spikes or whatever other monsters inhabit the chasms of the vasty deep.  (That's rather good isn't it?)</p>
<p>Don't worry about me. I'm as safe as the goldest sovereign <strike></strike> in the pocket of the mingiest Hebrew.</p>
<p>Much love, &amp; an equal amount of lingering embraces.</p>
<p>Your adoring filial encumbrance<br/>Keith</p>
