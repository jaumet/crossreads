<p>&amp; replenish our bottles at a public fountain.&nbsp; Dear oh dear how good that water tasted. <sub>^</sub> <sup>I simply poured it down my parched throat.&nbsp;</sup> We push on through the city &amp; descend a road leading on to a plain<s> the other side</s>.&nbsp; We are jogging along quietly when <strong>Crash! Crash!</strong>&nbsp; just ahead of us. we hear the scream of the shells but no explosion &amp; as we round a corner, come on to a British 60 pounder Battery.&nbsp; They are shelling a hill in the distance &amp; we can see the shells exploding on the crest<s> of the hill</s>.&nbsp; It is now dark &amp; we halt near the battery &amp; unsaddle &amp; feed up.&nbsp; We are to move on again in 3 hours.&nbsp; After a while we get the order to turn in &amp; we are not moving until next day.</p>
