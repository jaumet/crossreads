<p>Wednesday 8 January 1919<br/>Rafa<br/>Had a game of polo today reminding me of holidays I spent at Coomete how many years ago??  Tomorrow is anniversary of our fight here 2 years ago.  One of our best performances &amp; purely Light Horse &ndash; work.<br/>Dolly writes all is well with her &amp; the Babe.  She would like to go home before Australia but I want to see you first.  Very stiff after Polo, if I was a rich man I would love to go in for it.</p>
