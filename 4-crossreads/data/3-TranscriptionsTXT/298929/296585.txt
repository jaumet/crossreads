 4th  Went to Glichy a nearby village where some American troops are billeted. Villers Bretonneux was ratted for souvenirs yesterday.  To day we went for some but town was partly in flames and the rest occupied by the hun, a lot of the 35th who were billeted there were casualties. A 6? 2? German prisoner was brought back from the line by 2 little tommies. They had one rifle between them which was carried by the Hun, and they said they would march him all over France before they would go back to the line.
