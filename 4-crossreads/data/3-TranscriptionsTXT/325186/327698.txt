 I went on my fourteen days furlough  I spent five days in London &amp; the rest I spent in Norwich  I thoroughly enjoyed myself &amp; at the end of my furlough I reported to Monte-Video Camp at Weymouth  I went before the Doctor &amp; he marked me B.I.B.R.C which meant that I was under observation &amp; was to be re-classified every week. I spent about six weeks at Monte-Video then there I was sent to Westham Camp which was situated nearer to the town of Weymouth.  After one week at Westham &amp; I left there with a draft for No 1 Command Depot which was at Perham Downs
