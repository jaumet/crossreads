September 1918
way to England and the war will be over in another three months.

Sunday September the 1st 1918
To-days report from the front says that the British have started another offensive in Flanders, and have taken two or three large towns.

The news for September 5th, is that we are only 10 Kilometres from St Quintin, And that for the last two days it has been very quite all along the Front.
On the 10th the Papers say that another offensive is expected from the English very soon, but they do not know on what section of the line to expect it.
I bought a book of views of Soltau and other Camps to-day for a souvinir.

On the 20th I had a row which led to blows with a Russian. The trouble was caused through the Russian taking a frying pan that belonged to me & my mates. As it happened I wanted to use it & the Russian would not hand it
