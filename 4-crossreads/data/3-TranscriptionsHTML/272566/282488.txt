<p>Wednesday 14 February</p>
<p>Walked to Ayton Station.  Train to Berwick and then on to Edinburgh arriving there about 10 a.m.  Walked under Arthurs Seat &ndash; through Holyrood Palace and Edinburgh Castle.  Went into St. Giles Cathedral &ndash; passed John Knox's house.  Dinner at Jenners.  Afternoon trip to Firth of Forth in Motor Bus.  Its a pity the day has been foggy especially on account of the views from Edin. Castle and the Forth Bridge.  Saw portion of the fleet lying at anchor.  Returned to Berwick by train just after 5 p.m. and motored out to Ayton.  <br/>Also saw Scotts Memorial.</p>
