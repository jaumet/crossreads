 took of us two weeks ago. The chap nearest the camera is one of my best friends you met him in Kensington his name is Sgt Heydon. Well mother dear I will close now with fondest love to all from your loving son Ken 
 Dear Lizzie I got your letter this afternoon and another this morning from Ken. I am copying it for you. I got a photo of him in bed in the hospital &amp; others &amp; a nice looking nurse with them taken by a nurse. I daresay you got one. I am going to give it to a photographer to get enlargements. I can't go over tomorrow as I am getting a young woman in to clean up and will be with her. I am glad to hear he is in that hospital in Heliopolis. I daresay Ida had a finger in it - her brother is enlisting. Arty &amp; Alicks old girl Weanie has gone, good luck to them. Loving-----in &mdash;
