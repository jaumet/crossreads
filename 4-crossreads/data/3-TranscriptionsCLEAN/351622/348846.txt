  
 Letter from Annie Marshall giving me an invitation to stay at their home while I am on leave in London. 
 19 June 1916 Mon Exceptionally quiet day have not heard a gun so far. Last night we had to get out of bed twice on account of supposed gas attacks. Nothing came out of it. Have been mud casting & brick laying all day building onto the stoves & boilers in the cookhouse. Spent an hour with Steve at Louis estaminet 
 [Text continued in margin] after tea. 
 20 June 1916 Tues Making roadways all day with Sam Bailey. Am now of out of tent duties doing general fatigue work. News that Czernovitch has been taken. 6.30 p.m. went to the gas school going through the trenches full of the deadly chlorine gas. This was to test the helmets. Two breaths of it would prove fatal. We then experienced the weeping gas. Very funny to see all the boys crying. Letter from Linfield 
 [Note in margin] Paid to-day.
