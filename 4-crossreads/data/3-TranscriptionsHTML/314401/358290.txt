<p>The niggers are fallen in on the after part of the fo'c's'le deck, abaft the middle superstructure. They are short in stature but fairly intelligent looking.

The troops saluted, &amp; the flag was unfurled; our band played "God Save the King", then we gave three cheers &amp; sang the National Anthem.
