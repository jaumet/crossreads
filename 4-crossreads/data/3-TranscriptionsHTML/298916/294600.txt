<p>From noon the previous day till now, the average speed of the A13 had been 6 knots. At four o'clock that afternoon land was sighted &amp; gradually drew nearer. The coast is extremely steep &amp; is chiefly huge basalt columns. At last we came to Cape Raoul at the entrance of the River Derwent. On rounding this cape we came beam on to the swell &amp; for some minutes had an exciting time in keeping our feet. It was just dusk &amp; as we proceeded up the harbour a pilot boat came out to meet us and after satisfying himself he boarded the A13 &amp; the pass signal was hoisted. Each night this signal is changed, the night referred to it was two white lights over two red lights. When a pilot boards a steamer for the purpose of piloting her, he becomes the master of that ship until he has finished his mission, &amp; is held responsible for the ship. Should he issue an order, it is open for the captain to issue a contradictory order should he think advisable, but in his case, if anything (<strike>that</strike>) happened to the steamer through this contradictory order, there can be no claim made</p>
