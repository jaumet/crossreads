<p>Dear Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Recieved your letter written on the 29 June yesterday. Aunt forwarded it on. Was sorry to hear Father was not well. I heard you were not looking to well Mother Dear, now mind and do not overdo yourself. You are doing too much I think, in fact I am sure.<br/>Was glad to hear all the rest of the family are well. I am feeling tip top, and am in great condition.<br/>Everything is going on well, the only thing wer are getting a fair amount of rain.<br/>I was very sorry to hear about Cobcroft. I heard Christmas was back at Neutral Bay. He put a bandage on my leg [at] Pozieres.<br/>Did you recieve the last lot of photographs that Miss Astin sent you. They were not bad I think a good few letters must go astray, or take a trip to the bottom, as I do not get any reply to a lot I post.<br/>Hoping you are all well. Best wishes &amp; love<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom</p>
