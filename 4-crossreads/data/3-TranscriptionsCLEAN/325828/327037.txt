I was astounded & disgusted when I first came to London to see the women & girls in the pubs here scoffing down their beer, as we do our water & tea in Ausy. The crowds of ill-dressed & half-starved youngsters prowling about the streets would surprise you   As I say, Westminster is a very poor locality, & this is only to be expected.  I haven't taken to liquor yet, thank goodness, & I am glad to say it has no enticement for me.  And what I am better pleased at is this that our Medical Officer here, Capt. Kenneth Rodas de Vere Shaw my senior officer is a strict abstainer.  I have suspected for some time that this man has blue blood in his veins, & found out a few days ago, that he & Sir Gerald Strickland are first cousins. He is as true a man as you could wish to meet, & I am proud to work under him. Was glad to hear of Anna's success at the Intermediate Exam. & I am sure she deserved it.  She has more grit & brains in her than her youngest brother, but as long as I can earn my salt- why worry.
