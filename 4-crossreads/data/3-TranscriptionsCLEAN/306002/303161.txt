  
 25.5.15 Tue. 25th.  A few bombs & a little rifle fire was all that was doing after the Armistace ceased yesterday, bullets have been dropping too close to be comfortable this morning, while having breakfast one spoilt Matheson's water tin only a yard or two from us, & another landed at the door of our dug-out.  A Warboat has been dropping shells on the Turkish trenches on Popes Hill this morning, the shooting is marvellous.  About dinner time to-day the Triumph  struck  was hit by a German Submarine & sunk here close into the shore.  It was rumored a week ago that the Goliath had shared the same fate.  Had one or two rather heavy showers of rain soon after dinner but the sun shone out brightly at 4 o'clock & our Artillery spoke up soon after.  It is rumored that the submarine was sunk but we hear nothing official.  Stan put the afternoon in with Pittenbreigh & hummed 3 envelopes off him.
