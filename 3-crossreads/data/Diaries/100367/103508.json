(McCarthy).  Everyone on board knew Mac, and nearly every time he came along the deck he would be greeted with the words \"When are we getting paid, Mac\" ? at which Mac would bite very savagely.  Mac used to sleep on deck in an empty piano case, when the weather was good, and one night some of the lads emptied the contents of a tin of condensed milk all over Mac's blankets.  When Mac went to bunk that night, the milk sweetened his blankets alright, but it didn't sweeten Mac's temper.  No one of course knew how the milk got into the blankets or how the blankets got into the milk, or how Mac got into both, but being registered under the Pure Foods Act it must have stuck to Mac like a mustard plaster to a weezy chest.  Mac was annoyed, indignant, wroth, and challenged the offender, (whom he thought belonged to the Sergeant Quarters) to make himself known, but the challenge remained unchallenged.  He, however, stated that he would report the matter to the Ship's Adjutant if the culprit did not give himself up within 24 hours.  The time of the Armistice slipped by, so Mac couched the following letter of complaint:-</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sir,<br>\r\nI have to report that during the night of the 24th. instant. my blankets and myself were the recipients of the contents of a tin of condensed milk, &amp;c, &amp;c.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ship's Adj. was so amused at the letter that he, unbeknown to Mac, had copies of the letter made to show to his friends.  Poor Mac ? he made a deal of amusement for the boys on board, and by so doing, unconsciously kept up their spirits during times when things looked very \"blue\", brought about by that terrible scourge ? the Pneumonic ?flu, of which we had over 400 cases aboard, 30 of which \"passed out\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On another occasion when some of the men of the 15th G.S.R. (Vic) were on guard duty, and had just been relieved <strike>for the night</strike> and gone below for a few hours sleep, a number of those \"off duty\" when everything was quiet, slipped from their hammocks, and gently painted the faces of the sleeping heroes with Kiwi Black Boot Polish.  You can imagine what they looked like on the morrow, and how they were admired by their pals.  As Kiwi Polish is very hard to remove from the skin, I can assure you there was some extra scrubbing done on the dials of those diggers that morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nearly every troopship has its \"Magazine\", and ours was no exception to the rule.  A Committee was formed, and immediately got to work to obtain all the information possible in regard to its compilation.
