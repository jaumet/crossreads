<p>22.3.19<br/>At 2 p.m. we arrived at Malta &amp; moored in the inner harbor &amp; commenced taking in water.  We received a signal from the Naval head quarters that only Naval &amp; Military officers were allowed on shore &amp; no civilians.  The notices were posted up on the transport.  It caused a great deal of discontent, as the Civil passengers on board were mostly from the foreign office of Britian &amp; France &amp; on Government business.  Our Captain went on shore &amp; reported the matter to the Naval Admiral.  So fresh orders were issued allowing all from the Transport to visit the City of Vallatta, the whole taking advantage of the opportunity.</p>
<p>23.3.19<br/>Here we found a Japaneese cruiser &amp; 6 destroyers with 4 German submarines on their way to Japan.  All a powerfull fleet of British ships of war including one of our latest, fastest &amp; largest scout destroyers capable of doing 40 knots = 46 miles per hour also American destroyers in the harbor.  At 9 a.m. we asked permission of the Japanese Naval Admiral to visit the German U boats U.125 &amp; UB.12.  The former being 280 feet long the latter 220 feet.  We got aboard &amp; went through the largest a sight worth seeing &amp; had a peep through their periscopes of which they had 3 each, the objects could be seen as plain as using a pair of glasses.  The Machinery inside was very complicated, the whole inside utilised &amp; very little room for the crew, the largest has accodation for 46 hands</p>
