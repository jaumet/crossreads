1915Sep. 19 Sun.To-day 3 swims, 3 times out in one of the boats, a couple of walks round the ocean front & another one over the Sultan's estate - passed away the best part of the day.In the evening there was a Service on one of the fine wide verandahs looking out on to the ocean - The Service went off with quite a swing.I am writing up my diary on the same verandah after the Service, having bid goodnight to my young Scout friends.
