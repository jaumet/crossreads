Aug 13thCasualties for the Anzac Mounted Division in the Romain affair are estimated at 700 odd I believe. After returning from Katia on the night of the 5 & 6th, the first i.e. our L H Brigade rested until 3 pm of the 8th August during which time we learnt that Robertson's name had been sent in to be mentioned in despatches - also I believe the Colonel will get a DSO. out of it: - It was the chance of a lifetime anyway as the Brigadier I noticed was close by all the time.
At this time - 3 pm of the 8th Aug
