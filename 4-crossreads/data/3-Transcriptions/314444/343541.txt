<p>Dear Mr &amp; Mrs Ellis,</p>
<p>It is just twelve months today since poor Arthur died so I am writing in hopes that it may be some small comfort to you both to know that we have not forgotten him</p>
<p>His name often crops up and he is always spoken of with respect &amp; in the kindliest manner.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that you have been given strength &amp; courage to bear your heavy loss</p>
<p>He was a general favourite out here and a grand mate to work with and we miss him too so we can imagine how hard it is for you  so at any rate I am trying to help you bear your loss by letting you know the high esteem in which he was held out here</p>
<p>With Best wishes &amp; kindest regards<br/>I remain<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>G.E.W. Peate</p>
