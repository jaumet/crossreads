And I know just how 'twill be,
When the evening shadows, deepening
Shall bring in eternity
3
Though the Sun go down for ever
I have his unfailing Grace
And the Shadows darkly creeping
Cannot hide His blessed Face
For "they shall not walk in darkness"
"Who follow me, said He, 
And Glory of His Presence
Shall go down the Vale with me.
When the Shadows, darkly creeping
Shall bring in Eternity

"The Past"
"It is a well known fact that many men who had been in Holy Orders previous to the War, and enlisted, have thrown away altogether all profession of faith Some it is known, have been through Hospital even as Padres for venereal disease
The Past
They march before me in solemn array
These ghosts of my buried years
Ghosts of the days when I served the King
And knelt at His throne with tears
At the foot of His Throne with tears
2
Knelt at His Throne with tears for those
Who were as I am to day.
Wandering, wandering, out in the Gloom
Afar from the narrow way.
The straight and narrow way.
3
The Ghosts of a thousand Sermons pass
And gibe at me as they go,
And whisper, and whisper, stealing past
Of bottomless pits of woe
Of death, and pain, and woe
