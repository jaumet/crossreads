they seem to be very effective. Scouts observers and signallers were all on their own jobs round the field. The cookers came out and served dinners and our mess cart had brought out chairs tables and table clothes and we had an alfresco lunch on the grass. It was all very delightful. After lunch we put a good many more men on the specialists work and I had to stop the Lewis guns as they were sending too many bullets over. The battalion marched in at about 3.30 pm. Attended early at the Chateau and gave evidence against Lanyon. The 3rd Division seems to have done a good stunt last night and captured 200 prisoners. We saw some of the price paid going past in ambulances. Made preparatory arrangements for a dinner on our anniversary of leaving Aust. but find difficulty in getting supplies. Big guns round here are emplaced in back yards so as to be close to the officers billets. After mess went down to the 21st Battalion and there saw Duggan. Yarned there for a while. The streets full of our chaps and Yankees. They seem to fraternise very much and ought to get on well together. A warning order came to hand for our relief of the 10th Bde and Matthews and others will go forward afternoon tomorrow to reconnoitre.
