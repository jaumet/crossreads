<p>13 March, 1916<br/>Serapeum<br/>We got paid when we came in from Guard on Sat morning &amp; I also received some letters.  During the morning Mr Ryrie came in &amp; handed me my pass to go to Ismalia on the following day. Next morning Hickey Crouch &amp; I went down &amp; caught the 9.3 tram from [to?] Ismalia, Crouch scaled up without a pass, he &amp; Hick went up to Tel.el.Kebir &ndash; Ismalia struck me as being rather a pretty place but I did not have time to look around  it as I had get out to where Bert was camped.  I thought he was at Ferry Post but I found out that they had shifted to Moascar &amp; I got out there at about 12 o'clock  He looks well enough &amp; I was pleased to see him we had a long yarn, he could not get leave to come into town so I stayed in camp until about 8 oclock with him.  I was lucky to see him as he &amp; his company are leaving to day &amp; they think that they are going to France but I fancy that they will be bound elsewhere somehow  To day I have done practically nothing - took charge of the forage fatigue this morning.  To night some of the 5th &amp; 7th Regts went out on a patrol I expect we will be on it soon</p>
