<p>Wednesday 21 August<br/>Very hot all day &amp; I enjoyed a glorious swim in the river. Australian mail.<br/>We bearers move up to-night on the South of the Somme in the vicinity of Proyart for a pretty big stunt.</p>
<p>Thursday 22 August<br/>At 10.30 last night we moved to a quarry on the outskirts of Mericourt sur Somme, where we arrived at 2 a.m. this morning.  Everything is now quiet &amp; the line is not too far away. Rumour hath it that some troops went over this morning &amp; took Bray sur Somme.  Certainly the artillery here was active. Very hot all day &amp; Fritz has been shelling the village all day off &amp; on. We are camping in the village, in a cellar, to-night.</p>
