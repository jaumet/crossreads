& all sorted out informed have to be barrack room orderlies for a time - i.e. shave & clean boots every day etc. Dismissed 11.15am & shaved & cleaned rifles. Have to manage best we can for tucker today. All other btns are OK for food except us. No transport was sent back with us last night. Huns dropped bombs near Hazebrouck so there was a great clatter with anti-aircraft shells & the bombs. Our btn was to go into line near Ypres last night & hop over early this morning. After tea went into Hazebrouck with Bradley & had steak eggs & chips costing 2 francs 6 each. Windows are broken everywhere by bomb concussion & several places badly damaged. Saw 2 anti aircraft guns on road on way in.
