a sweet Mademoiselle (of 21 years).   She is very pretty, with pink cheeks and bright eyes and quite captivated me for the time being.   I promised to return & see her again before we left Contay.
May.  20.   Sunday.    Rest in shade by the creek during the forenoon.   After lunch Alan & I walked to St. Gratien Village and after a cup having a cup of cafe we went to the Catholic Church there.    We then walked across to Molliens-aux-bois, had more cafe & went to church again.  We returned through Beaucourt and arrived at Camp an hour late, but were let off on the first offender's plea.
May 21.   "Physical Jerks" before breakfast, drill & route march during the day.   After tea we walked to another village & there had some cafe-au-lait and bought a few post-cards.
May 22.   No parade in morning on account
