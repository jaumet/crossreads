Thursday 5
 Tomorrow Good Friday I have visions of Sydney Station crowded mountain trains. Had some special pastry made by an excellent French cook. Beautiful day night.
Friday 6
 Move this morning from Buire to Bazentin again. The guns can just be heard from here. Beautiful day the sky larks are going their hardest. Move tomorrow to Bapaume.
Saturday 7
 Out of the Somme once more in Pas de Calais. We moved from Bazentin via Flers, Le Roque Tilloy to Bapaume. This town now 7 miles remote from the line is in a very battered condition is still shelled by Fritz. About the size of Albert but it seems a better class of town. Guns can be distinctly heard. The neighbouring country is not in a bad state at all. M.D.S.
