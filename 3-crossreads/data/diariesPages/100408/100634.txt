Went down town and bought some bread for the tent.
10/10/17 Cold all last night. Up 5.30am paraded 7.15am full marching order but did not move out. Left 1pm marched 1 miles where we all got into old motor buses bound for Ypres. Rained all morning but afternoon nice fine though cold. Travelled via Steenwoorde, Abeele outskirts of Poperinge to Ypres arriving 6pm. Marched couple miles through Ypres across paddocks full of shell holes mud slush up to ankles got lost in so doing therefore had to bivouac in open for the night of course it rained. Had to go to bed without any tea as cookers also got lost. Considering
