<p>28 Oct, 1916<br/>Hill 70  Sinai<br/>Back in camp again.  I have felt a sort of home sickness since I came back &amp; it is developing into a beastly feeling of restlessness; guess if we dont soon make a shift some where I'll go dilly.  Godber wants to know how a man who is "Maknoon" go "maknoon"  perhaps there is something in the suggestion of his remark.  Any how a weeks leave is no good, notlong enough by a 1/4.  Last night I was on Picquet a nice change after Sidi Bashr &amp; Alex; had beetles off the chaff bags crawling over me all night.  The leave to Alex is cut out now so I must be thankful to <strike>get</strike> have got my week in; they are giving a week to Port Said instead.  Wouldnt have Port Said on my mind after Alex; no comparison.  Joe Woods is due home to night I am anxious to see Joe to see how he got on after I left there as he had some thing of special interest in view.  Harold [Liabrand?], Beuzeville, &amp; Tom Sherry put in for the camel corp to day, can almost hope that Pom wont get in.  Hes a good sort &amp; I'll miss the old sport if he goes &ndash; Tom sent &amp;pound;2.0.0 with Joe Woods when he was coming to Alex to me, it was deuced thoughtful of him.</p>
