morrow mornings move, all the platoon Sergts were there, the orders were that we were to move off at 8 in the morning taking our overcoat waterproof blanket with us leaving our pack behind.
After getting our Orders we went back to bed reveille was at 6, I had no time to lose for I had to slip round to wake up the boys for they were sleeping far apart, draw the rations bombs, sandbags, etc to see that they were issued, then I had to get my breakfast pack up as soon as I could, the morning was very threatening cold as blazes," so things were not too pleasant, after breakfast we fell in" each platoon detailed some men off to clean up the possies before moving off. I left some letters my diaries with Jack Hayes instructions what to do with them in case the worst happen's, the march up to here where I am writing this in "Delville Wood"
