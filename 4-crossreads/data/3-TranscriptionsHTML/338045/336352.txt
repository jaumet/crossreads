<p>until 9 pm.</p>
<p>Nov 14th Tuesday</p>
<p>Misty &amp; cold day. Very glad am not in camp or at the front. Still waiting for a letter from home. A few games of billiards &amp; usual resting about. Another good concert by Welsh Guards, who are in camp near here.</p>
<p>Nov 15th Wednesday</p>
<p>Beautiful day, first sunshine. Very little to do by eat, sleep, &amp; be merry. No further news as to what is likely to happen. Horrible concert by some amateurs.</p>
<p>Nov 16th &ndash; Thursday</p>
<p>After so long waiting the long envelope arrives</p>
