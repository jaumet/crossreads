are advancing in the Dvinsk [?] region as well as in the Caucasus.Nothing has turned up in regard to my promotion, & although the doctor seems satisfied with me, I get absolutely no privileges in respect of my work.I hear that several Aust. units have left Egypt, & taken with them a couple of hospitals.  I want to get back to them now:  for there seems no hope of promotion here.I am sadly disappointed in my progress since I became a soldier.I have worked hard & intelligently here on responsible work, but nothing seems to come of it,
