a good night's work told me to turn in for the rest of the night, it was not much use turning in for my dugout was sopping wet I was even in a worse state for I was covered from head to foot with mud wet to the skin, but the boys had some nice hot cocoa waiting for me this helped to thaw me, there is one thing we get now in the trenches that is the little "Tommy cookers", they are made of paffarin wax are put up in little tins, they light instantly produce no smoke, the "Australian Comforts Funds" send them to us.
This morning when I went round for the boys rum I drew a blank for the Q.M. sent a bottle of whale oil instead how they roared when I told them didn't they perform, reckoned the heads had drunk it etc
