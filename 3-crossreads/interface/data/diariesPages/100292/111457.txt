we will strive to attain that lofty plane of true &amp; perfect Love. When I revisit the past twelve months my heart overflows in a paen of happy rejoicing. It has given me you, the gentlest, sweetest truest &amp; best lassie man can be blest with. May I ever be worthy of my great possession. I'll write no day by day news this time dear. Will reserve till our next. Good night my love, may sweet sleep give you all his rest. Ever yours  Chas. <br/>
P.S. Mary arrived home safely yesterday
