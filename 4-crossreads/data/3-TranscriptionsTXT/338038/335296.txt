I came over in the boat from England with Maurice Ferguson from Jerilderie - He has been through a school in England & has just got his commission - was surprised to hear he is married and the proud possessor of a son & heir, ten days old! He married an English girl when he was on leave from Gallipoli last year.
Also had a strange meeting today - Was out with a company for exercise on a route march, and was talking casually to an Engineer officer who was with me. And he turned out to be a Darbyshire, nephew of Aunt Laura - He seems a very nice fellow indeed -
I will wind up  with this short note for the present. There is absolutely nothing in the way of news -
Your loving SonTerence W.Garland
