out of 3 on Thursday night. We scored one game each on Wednesday. An eager onlooker who did not hesitate to criticize incidentally mentioned that he was a Tournament winner had a few games with her on Saturday and registered a "Gutser" being licked two games out of three.
Tuesday, 11-3
The abovementioned on-looker had another few games with the lady and lost two of them. and In the one he won she lost a Rook by a palpable oversight and refused to take his queen when he left it up for her. I got my own back off her on Saturday winning the odd game we got one each last night. I don't know whether I have mentioned the great "Combien" Society here. I will not go into details but simply mention that it is a great industry. The principal market is on the Bank of the Canal in front of the Aust. Corps Camp. There is no sewerage system in this Town at all. People leave "parcels" anywhere. In this house the people are finically particular in the house but leave "parcels" anywhere in the yard which naturally "hums". I went to Jumet (on the main Brussels road) with Monsieur on Sunday last. The Hon. Fritz seems to have knocked this suburb about more than any other part of Charleroi. He compelled the inhabitants to brick up the Doors windows of the wrecked houses so as to conceal (partly) the damage done. Here I frequently seen a notice "Begging from foreigners is forbidden".
