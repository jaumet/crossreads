Sunday 24th December.Christmas Eve. Attended Communion Service & Church Parade, a treat to hear some music again. Enjoyed a hot bath, the first for a month, & new clothes. Feel a new man again, went to a fair sized village with Eric, spent rather a pleasant time there. Another big mail arrived for me. Three parcels & 22 letters. This makes 75 letters in three weeks that I have received. At mid-night a great crowd of us, sang Christmas Carols outside the Officers Quarters, a great joke half the crowd having had a drop too much.
Monday 25th December.Christmas Day. What a difference to that of last year at Serapeum. It was over a hundred degrees in the shade, today it must be close on Freezing Point. Porridge for breakfast, a great luxury. The mess tent was beautifully decorated with holly & flags etc. & a big notice was pinned to the door -
