<p>I included in this list a corporal who with the others was being returned to Australia the following day.&nbsp; The novelty in the proceedings was that I placed my own name as a corporal in his place, and at once put on the two stripes.&nbsp; The boss returning the following day saw the two stripes and asked me how I got them.&nbsp; I explained the circumstances, and - retained the promotion.&nbsp; I had been a lance-corporal so long that I thought it was time I got a &quot;rise&quot;, and being in a position to give myself one, I did not miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>Towards the latter end of January &#39; 19 a notification was received from the A.I.F. headquarters in London for me to report there for duty as early as possible.&nbsp; Needless to state I was very glad, and promptly started packing up.</p>
<p>My boss insisted on my seeing and spending a few days in</p>
<p><u>BRUSSELS</u>.</p>
<p>so one morning, after putting all my belongings in the car, he and I started for that grand city, arriving there, - after a most interesting drive, - during the early evening.&nbsp; What a glorious place it is.&nbsp; After having a good dinner and general clean up, I start out with the intention of seeing as much of the life and place as I could in the couple of days I should be there.&nbsp; Life, ye gods!&nbsp; the place was wonderful.&nbsp; Went to a theatre and when that was over visited one of their huge saloons and dancing halls, which were still in full swing when I left at 4.a.m..It seemed to me that Brussels never slept.&nbsp; Paris was gay, but this place - well! a few days here and a chap would have to go away for a &quot;spell&quot;.&nbsp; I never dreamt of such life and gaiety.&nbsp; Paris was fairly lively even when I visited it during the war, so perhaps I&#39;m wrong in thinking that this place beat it.&nbsp; If Paris is more lively than Brussels was at the time I speak about, well! all I can say is that the Parisians must very soon wear out.&nbsp; I spent two days there, all my cash, and all my wakefulness too.&nbsp; The pace was too hot.&nbsp; The excitement too much.</p>
