Paris7/3/17sheer beauty cannot be surpassed.  It reminds me of the Chapel of Henry VII at Westminster Abbey.  It is lovely and one mass of stained glass in the sides high narrow windows and in the altar end also.  Above the door is a rose window.One is constantly seeing wonders each of which surpasses the others but this little chapel is easily the best.  The snow was now coming down very heavily so took the Metro back to the Opera - excellent clean trains and neatly dressed people everywhere.  Wrote some letters and had 5 o'c tea with Mrs Enkenstein.  The little Rumanian tete-a-tete with a French officer so she could not join the party worse luck.
