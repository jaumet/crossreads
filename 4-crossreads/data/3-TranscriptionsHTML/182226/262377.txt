<p>Tuesday 21 December, 1915</p>
<p>Put in isolation because smallpox had broken out at Gozo.</p>
<p>Pinched into Valletta without a pass. Went out to Pieta &amp; came back to camp at about 12.30 a.m. I brought a flask of Cognac back for the boys &amp; it was duly appreciated.</p>
<p>They are very strict here now &amp; it took me all my time to beat the pickets.</p>
