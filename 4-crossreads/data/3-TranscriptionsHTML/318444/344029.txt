<p>&amp; it is announced that an armistice is signed. News taken without any demonstration.<br/>In fact the Bn had its "muck up" the week previous at Bellancourt on a false alarm so they don't take any interest now.</p>
<p>Nov 12th Tues:-<br/>Rumour hath it that we are to go on to Coblenz for occupation purposes.</p>
<p>Wed Nov 13th:-<br/>Marched from Bazuel this morning via Le Cateau to Busigny &amp; billeted.</p>
<p>Thurs Nov 14th:-<br/>"Cleaning up" parades &amp; it is looked upon as certain for us to go to Germany.<br/>No one enthusiastic except perhaps some of the "heads" who see their good jobs leaving them shortly.<br/>That reminds me. We have now with us an officer who wears the 1914 red service chevron &amp; who has never been to any part of this war.<br/>The first time he joined the Bn was just before the Armistice so he must have judged things well.</p>
<p>Fri Nov 15th:-<br/>Pay Day. Drew the large fortune of 20 francs (15/4) paid by Lt Thomas.</p>
