<p>13<br/>22/5/16.<br/>Very quiet day to-day. Have just been across to the Coy &amp; the lads are all going through their kit bags. We are only allowed to take 1 bag with us &amp; consequently the kit has to be reduced. I've made arrangements to sneak a few extras away in a stationery box. Everything points to a speedy departure.</p>
<p>25/5/16.<br/>Very busy these last few days nothing but the General Routine has happened. Marching out states &amp; Embarkation Rolls are the order of the day.</p>
<p>26/5/16.<br/>Went for a swim with Dud Otton this afternoon it was great. To-night The Colonel lectured us on our departure &amp; warned us not to be absent when wanted &amp; told us the penalty.</p>
