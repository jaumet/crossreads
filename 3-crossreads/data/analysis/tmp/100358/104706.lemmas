 The train trip down to Sydney was most uncomfort , and some of the men need a good deal of look after for they had been drown , in everi sens of the word , their troubl . We march to the show ground between a pack line of most feminin face , but here and there were scatter the return men on their crutch stick , look thought on the pass four of the great uniniti . I could look on our column in much the same way too , but not quit in the same light as these Gallipoli lad . There was a big tedious review , and then we march to our quarter in the poultri shed in the Ground . Leav till 11 o'clock was given but most of the boy stay up all night and came in just befor reveill at 3 a.m. The scene then was one of anim as the thousand men rose and hurrid put on their putti . We were soon away , and at 3.30 a.m. the gate of the show ground open and we pass through . The crowd outsid was a wonder sight . Women children who had wait all night in the cold were scurri here there inquir for their husband , ask in eager voic for a man who no one knew and few of the weari men care about . They becam near frantic as the column move on but everi now then a cri of joy show that some sweetheart or wife had locat her man . They forc themselv into the line march with the column , some of the wive take their soldier husband white kit bag the husband take the child . We stumbl along in the dark the crowd grow grow . Along Bourk St . door and window open , gas lamp were lit and mani peopl scantili clad stream into the road and onto balconi to give us a cheer . It was the most romant march I have ever taken part in . All the condit were strang , and I have never seen so mani sad farewel befor . The children simpli clung to their father and some of the small girl collaps absolut in a heap and their sweetheart
