<p>During this month &amp; part of August the natives celebrate a religious custom by fasting between the hours of 4 AM to 8 PM daily. During  these hours very little work is done and the time is occupied by sleeping. After the hour of 8PM they are allowed to eat as much as they like, till the early hours of the morning, when again they fast. After this month expires, there is proclaimed 3 days holiday, when the natives clothe themselves &amp; their wives &amp; children in their very best attire and parade the streets, eating drinking and making merry. The sight is one never to be forgotten for the different colors &amp; the flags all blending together to make the scene a very gay one. Even little children come out in silk and satin &amp; the colors are like the rainbow. Cannons are fired, &amp; everything is done to proclaim the days of fasting are ended.</p>
