<p>be able to gather from this the kind of fast life we are now living in underground pits.</p>
<p>That sheepskin vest you gave me has been most useful already &amp; I think with its aid I will possibly be able to pull through the winter!  We have for the last week or two had real good weather considering the time of year.  I heard from Wilkie a few days ago he seemed flourishing &amp; had taken on office work which I think is v. wise of him.</p>
<p>You may have seen the notice of the death of my brother, the one you met when you had that house at Manly if you remember;  I am now trying to get leave to be home for the dedication of the window the family have erected to his memory but do not know whether it will come off.  I must now end up &amp; take advantage of a fairly warm day to wash some article of clothing (only having one of each) &amp; also attend to the many irritating visitors!  With kindest regards &amp; please remember me to all at Tog. [Toganmain].</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Ernest E. Kirby</p>
