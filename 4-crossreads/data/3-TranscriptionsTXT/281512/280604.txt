23rd AugustSo much passes, so much seen, & such unprecedented happenings that to enter them at length would take hours. Here it is 11 Pm. & I have just returned from the Artillery on hill 60, & as weary & tired after 60 miles jolting that I feel like dropping off to sleep.  In the morning I went in my service Car, which by the way is a Ford, accompanied by Wilkins, to the large centre St. Omer, to buy a camp bed. This I have found essential as the great amount of condensation, even on the grass under the tents, makes ground sleeping decidedly unhygienic. The Twenty mile ride out was delightful;  the grain has all been harvested & now stands in sheaves ready for "ricking". The beautiful Avenued roadways & quaint villages, with the troops billeted & drilling therein offer pictures at every turn. At Ballieul I saw great numbers of our infantry who are now recuperating,
