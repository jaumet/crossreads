3.  an intense desire to giggle.  It's no use it's deep-rooted in us & I caught Walter in the act also one day before he left!  Even having a U.S. father doesn't seem to erase it!Now just a few words about that cable (the birthday one.)  You will at least know by now, from my last letter, that when I sent it I hadn't dreamed of you hearing anything about Rid's sickness, but how funny you must have thought it that I didn't say he was well or better or something.  Oh no though! Now I come to think of it you thought it was sent by Rid & that very fact proved he was well again.     I am so glad that it reached you before the birthdays, even though it was not all quite clear to you, I was very anxious for it to get there in time.  I hope you have not since been disappointed to find that at that time we had not all seen each other as the cable implied.  As a matter of fact I had got Walter's permission to include his name and had written to Leo telling him I was going to include his, so that we really were all in touch over it.          It was so nice to hear of how you spent Father's birthday, it sounded all very sweet & restful and I hope Mother's was spent as nicely, we ought to hear about it next mail.     The fortnight between mails seems a long while to wait does it not?So far I am afraid I have no news to give you of Wal and Le, and the diary part of Rid's letter I sent on to you two days back & there has been nothing since.   However I shall not close this yet for some days & there may be something more by then.  I rather fear that they may be holding back military letters & if so I suppose we shall have to believe it is for some wise purpose and be glad of the precautions they are taking, though letters do mean so much don't they.  I expect I should not have had the one I did from Rid only that he gave it to the Purser on the "Bohemian" to post when they got back to Alexandria.  A happy thought wasn't it?
