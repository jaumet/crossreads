<p>Tuesday 29 February, 1916</p>
<p>Pay day (&pound;2)</p>
<p>We finished off our Gun pit alltogether this morning &amp; went out on another job in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I am feeling very tired. All the hard work is beginning to tell. Thank goodness today is the last time we will be digging.</p>
<p>We are moving over to brigade Headquarters tomorrow.</p>
