 Pieroits from the 36 Ulster Division, and the greater part of the 10 Brigade attended. General  Monash inspected the Brigade today, and we have been very busy this past few days getting ready for it. It has been fine this evening but it is going to be wet again to night &amp; we don't relish the prospect of again sleeping out in the open. I have not seen any newspapers for several days. To night a terrible storm came on, the rain fell in torrents, the wind blew with terrific force, &amp; I thought it was going to blow the tents away, and the lightening came in blinding flashes, and the thunder was awful. It was the worst storm I have seen for years. Fortunately it did not last long. It commenced about 9.00 &amp; was over about 10. p.m. We would have been wet through only we took the precaution to erect the mess cart cover over our beds, &amp; fixed up the sides with bags &amp; limbre covers, and the whole tied securely to the ground. 
 Friday June 29, 1917. (1061). It is fine this morning but the ground is wet, and the creek running through the Valley is running a banker. Just before the storm reached its climax last night one of the baloons was brought. Fritz had been shelling it but whether a shell hit it or it was struck by lightening I cannot say. A ray of light shot away from the baloon &amp; it collapsed &amp; gradually floated down to earth. The baloon did not catch fire.
