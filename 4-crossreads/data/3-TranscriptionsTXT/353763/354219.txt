Friday Oct 2 - 1914Nothing doing - a good swim at 7 am  -  At 8.30 AE2 was signaled 'get ready to go out'  -  This order was eagerly & promptly obeyed  -  Presently another signal came which washed out everything  -  All the war ships including the Montcalm went out yesterday aftn  -  they came back at noon to  - day  -  Some of the NOs growl at things in general & at havy nothing to do  -  As we don't know all the factors of the game & are not in a position to judge I think to grouse at your superiors shows great want of judgment not to say common sense & I steadily say so  -  We may have to wait - inactive & sluggish - but it's all a part of the game - the jolly rapid bits are - like plums - few & far between  -
Its far better to be here than lurking Germans in the North Sea anyway amid rain & slush & fog - with destroyers by night & submarines by day seeking to sink you  -
About 1  - 30 pm a gun was fired on the flag ship  -  There is to be a court martial at 4 pm & its part of the service routine for one gun to be fired  -  Who is to be potted we don't know but a court martial in war time is a serious matter  -  Ashore there's nothing doing Major JColonelPaton H.of staff told me when I was bathing  -  The Berrima hopes to go round to Europe eventually leaving of course detachments her & at Herbertshohe & Wilhelm Haven  -
