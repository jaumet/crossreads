Rode down to La Chausee to see the Brigade Competition for platoon championship. 24th won 22nd 2nd.After lunch General Robertson, Marin and myself motored over to 3rd DHQ at Hallencourt to attend their sports. Met General Cannon Jess and others and had an enjoyable day. Some Australian nurses out from Abbeville and a number of French ladies – some very nice. The sports were well run and arrangements excellent. Our run over in the car took an hour through pretty country and pleasant villages. Everyone elated. A feeling that a weight has been lifted off us. Tomorrow a conference of Divisional Commanders at Peronne and rumour says that 1, 5 & 2 Divisions move up and that 3rd remains behind. The reforming of the fourth battalions ought now to be seriously reconsidered.
