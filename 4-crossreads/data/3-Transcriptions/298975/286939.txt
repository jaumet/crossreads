<p>went through a water pipe</p>
<p>Tuesday 14th<br/>Much as usual, Except the meals were better, grilled chops replaced our old friend Stew. A lecture by an R.F.C Lut on Flying machines &amp; Flying. Physical culture class got properly going again today</p>
<p>Wednesday 15<br/>Much cooler. Awnings all down again. But our ventilaton has been taken away &amp; the last two nights were very hot down here I tried to get it put in again but none seemed to care much. The Auxly Cruser caused some excitement today. She was about 5 miles out on the Port side all</p>
