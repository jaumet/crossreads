 C Company&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3rd letter) 18th Battalion, Casula. Friday, 12th November 1915. 
 Dear Father &amp; Mother/. I received your letters during the week and I will do as father says regarding the notice to  Saddington. 
 Twelve thousand men left our camp at Holdsworthy for Liverpool last Friday. They made a very fine show marching out with bands playing and colours flying. It left the camp fairly empty but crowds of new men have been coming in daily since. We are now among the more experienced men at the camp the others being, for the most part "Marmalades." (The name given to all new recruits). We struck camp this morning and marched to Casula from Holdsworthy.
