<p>Dear Jack &amp; Clare,<br/>I hope you wont mind me the way I send you such spasmodic letters &amp; all that. You cant imagine how things get mixed here &amp; what arrangements we have &amp; their limitations.</p>
<p>Still just a line to let you know I'm living and pretty healthy generally on it. I hope I can say the same in a week or so as we are expecting 'some' scrap in a few days &amp; I think its going to be heavy at that. However we'll wait for it before we say any more. I'm afraid I'm very poor at sending you any description of these things but I'll tell you all about it when I come back.</p>
<p>Hope everybody is quite well. Your last letter seemed to show you in a bit of a mix up. I was intending to send you a few quidlets as a Xmas cheerer but was unable to do so. Should you want a few quid let Lizzie know. Her last address was B.H. She'll always do anything possible for you too &amp; you know its your just dues. I think she can manage it alright for you &amp; I am writing her on the subject in case you find it necessary.</p>
<p>Sorry old chapsies to hear of all the bad luck,</p>
