My dearest Father,You will forgive me if this is a short note but I hear there is a mail leaving for Australia tomorrow & there is just the slightest chance of catching it.  Last Sunday I found out where Walter was & went out to see him.  I was thankful to find him quite well, & so far A.1. as I had heard he had been wounded.  He was quite himself & I thought he looked better than I've seen him for some time   He paid me a surprise visit again this afternoon, & said he was on the move again tomorrow.  I understood him to say he had forwarded a cable to you stating he was O.K.  Very busy these days.  I have received all your letters to date 1st June for which I thank you very much.  Quite summer weather here now more like Egyptian than anything- very hot in day & very cold with often a heavy dew at night.  Wal showed me a letter from you dated June 14th in which Ol had just reached homeTrust she is well, unable to write her this mail.  Must also thank Anna for her interesting letter of June 1st & must at same time congratulate her on the results of her School Exams.Arnold Hazlewood has been knocked but I don't
