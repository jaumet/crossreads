  
 fall out & were dismissed. Have no idea why it was done but as it has turned out a very wet night & I have rather a bad cold am rather glad allthough it means going through the whole performance again next week 
 Wednesday 10th Was transferred to A Co as they send the next draft. Put in all day  doing it  going there It took us quite half an hour 
 Thursday 11 Usual Parades but as there was a good deal of rain put in most of our time in the shelter sheds. This is the first decent rain for some time & it was badly needed The wheat crops about here are very good not very high but big well filled heads Applications were called for a Machine Gun school so put in am not very keen on it but it seems about the only way to get another 4 days leave & I am keen on that
