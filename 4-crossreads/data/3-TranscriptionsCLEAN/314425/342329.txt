  
 Another batch of German U. boats surrendered yesterday. The officers looked ashamed but the men were not. 
 Tuesday Nov 26 1918. 16. There is a light misty rain all this morning. This evening I made up a parcel for my wife containing the following. 1 envelope -  12 French P.C. of Abbeville, 1 envelope - 12 views of Devonport & Plymouth. 1 envelope - 21 P.C. views of Boulogne and 5 others mostly of famous views that were [indecipherable] dug outs. 50 P. Cards in all. 
 Wednesday Nov 27 1918. 17. A fine mild day. I sent two Anzac Bulletins 
 to my wife & 2 P.C. to A. Kennedy & posted the packet of Post Cards in Devonport this afternoon. I had a ramble around Devonport today passed the barracks the General's house & the Admiral's House, the bluff which slopes steeply down to the waters edge. In the Sound which is very narrow there are three training ships anchored fore & aft. One of them is the last wooden war ship built & the other the first ironclad. In the distance I could see the break water stretching away in front of the entrance and the place where the "Persic" hove too on our arrival from Australia.
