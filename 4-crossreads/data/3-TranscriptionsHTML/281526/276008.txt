<p>16/12/17 Kortypip [Kortepyp]<br/>Church parades were held all the morning in a Y.M.C.A hut in the Camp and a good deal of cleaning up was carried out. In the afternoon there was a black sky and many snowflakes which did not lie about for long. Rode out with the Company Commanders along very good roads out to Ploegsteert Wood to reconnoitre our readiness position. Fritz was putting over some heavy shells close to the road and rather frightened the horses which were very fresh. He also shelled the vicinity of our camp during the morning. We went right up to Red Lodge and in the wood we marked out the ground for the assembly. A dominating ridge runs through the wood on its reverse slope is a cemetery. In the wood are many old gun positions with boxes and little bags of explosive lying about. The pools were all frozen over with a thin ice. Rode</p>
