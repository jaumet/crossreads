<p>No. 1 New Zealand General Hospital,<br/>Brockenhurst, Hants.</p>
<p>through yet don't you.  I am going to swing the lead over here as long as I can.  No more war for me if I can help it.  it makes me feel cold when I think of going <strike>for</strike> back again.  I have a lovely little camera with me.  I have had it for nearly eight months and I had some lovely war pictures some nearly cost me my life to get them and they were all blown up with the gun.  I had them in my pack with my few belongings, when I got to the hospital I only had what I stood up in no <strike>p</strike> hat no putties and I hadn't had a shave or a wash for about two weeks, so you can imagine what I looked like.<br/>I hope you will excuse my scribbling and mistakes for I am a bit shaky on it.</p>
