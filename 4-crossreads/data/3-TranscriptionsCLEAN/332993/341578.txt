It is the best water I have seen in France & the stones in this district the first also.  They are mostly flints, with some hard lime stones.This afternoon all the transports washed & cleaned their web equipment & brightened the brass work in accordance with Brigade orders.

Butter knife & 1 paper knife made out of the driving band of a British 18 pounder shell, 1 serviette ring made out of a German driving band, 1 piece of alluminium being a fragment of the timing fuse of a German shell.
