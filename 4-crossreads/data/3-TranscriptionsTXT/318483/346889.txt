 It was while working here that I heard of the operations then in progress at the front &amp; I immediately asked H.Q. A.I.F. for permission to go up.  This was given but I was asked to catalogue pack &amp; deposit at the Kit Stores all my pictorial records before going up.  This work used up three days &amp; when I at length reached the front  after a journey  (a matter of 3 to 4 days journey) the operations before mentioned were over &amp; I was only able to record the ground.  But from the point of view of local &amp; military interest the visit was most profitable as I was enabled to make sketches of the other side of the Jordan, the Jordan, the Jericho Plain, the Dead Sea &amp; other sketches of interest. 
 The time limit was now drawing perilously near &amp; I returned to Cairo, there to find that I had missed a wire  asking  advising me that passage had been arranged.  After one night in Cairo I left for Alex &amp; proceeded to London.
