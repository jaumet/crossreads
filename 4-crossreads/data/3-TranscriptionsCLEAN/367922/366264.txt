Give an Aussie a job to do & he will do it & you can depend on it being done. I have seen a number of troops of all countries & studied them & I feel proud that I am an Australian. I wish I could tell you why they are  better  the best in the world but it would take too long. 
 So, Uncle, though the loss of such fine boys is deeply felt by you all, yet I know you feel proud that they saw their duty and fearlessly carried it out, dying a patriots death,  though  and their British spirit and fine example will go down to posterity and give the lie to those who say that the British bull dog breed is becoming decadent. 
 Well, time grows late so in closing send you all my very best love and affection and sincerely hope that the day is not far distant when the family will be reunited to enjoy the years of peace.
