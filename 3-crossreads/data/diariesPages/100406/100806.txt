An M.P. who carried his badge in his Breast pocket pulled me up in Charleroi today asked to have a at my Pay Book. This is the first time I have been stopped by a M.P. without his arm badge on. It is a good idea because previously the Shrewdies could always see an M.P. some distance off Hop it while the going was good.

Went to the Concordia to see the "Dinkum Blue" Diamonds. Very poor show. While coming home I was passing a Motor Car, a M.P. called on the Driver to stop, he took no notice, the M.P. called once more then fired two shots from his Revolver, one shot went through the Bonnet and damaged the Engine. This took place in a crowded street. I don't know whether I have mentioned it before but two Aussie Deserters have been shot in Estaminet brawls since I have been here. Some of our "strays" have been "Holding up" people even Estaminets with Revolvers.

Blew out the Murray-Prior combination twice last night but have a strong suspicion that the first game was not genuine. Company had to Parade today owing to the Slack Gaurds they have been putting up lately. We are to parade twice a week untill there is an improvement. This morning's parade was no joke. It was snowing and the wind was enough to cut a man to pieces.

Was advised today that I was on the next draft for Aussie. Seen the Q.M.
