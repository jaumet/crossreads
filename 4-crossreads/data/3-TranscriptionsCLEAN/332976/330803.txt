  
 March 1917 4th continued   lifted about midday he began to shell us with some of his "heavy stuff."  He plastered a small space about a hundred & fifty yards from us nearly all the afternoon but about 3.30 he got closer & we had to clear out. Fritz sent over a few gas shells last night about 10 P.M. but the wind freshened & after about an hour with our helmets on we were safe again. 5th    When we got up this morning it was snowing & continued until about midday.  I have had the day off, as I am to leave for the front line at about 6 P.M. to look after some work there.
