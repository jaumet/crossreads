<p>December 1917<br/>Thursday 27<br/>Attack on line. Irish Div well into it. Great success. They did in 1 day what they were expected to do in 2. We advanced and took up position.<br/>Turks attacked Jerusalem at same time as we attacked them. 60th Div cut Jacko to pieces. He did not know where he was and could not reinforce either place.<br/>Did outpost sniper put in a few shots</p>
<p>Friday 28<br/>Very quiet all day.<br/>Built nice bivouac and then had to advance at night .Did outpost. Talk about Italian Alpine climbers. Terrible climbing down steep hill and up on another with all our gear and canteen and gift stuff. Awful load. Did outpost. Very quiet. Advance in afternoon; short distance and camped</p>
