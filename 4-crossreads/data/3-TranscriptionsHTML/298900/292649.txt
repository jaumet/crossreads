The dinner itself was also a success being about 8 courses, the Menus being written in Flemish.

It was a most successful spread, nothing to mar the proceeding the whole evening.   The patients did very well as there was a lot of stuff left over which was handed over to them to deal with.   I was dead tired when I turned in.</p>
<p>Tuesday 19th March<br/>    Raining all day so I had a holiday, a very welcome one.  Helped to clean up the debris of the night before &amp; did some reading.  Fritz now sends shells over fairly regularly but so far has confined his attentions to places</p>
