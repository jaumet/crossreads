<p>to you the purchase of a bad [pad], like to that from which this sheet comes, to place it upon some table, any old one will do, and with pen, pencil of lead if you wish, to jot down items, a brief sentence will suffice, which you must know will be of interest to me.  None of you has apprised me of the name of the New Minister for Public Instruction in New South Wales.  Heaps of other things a word about would help me &amp; save me trouble.  I am almost despairing that you will bother about any request in my letters.  You read them through, of course, but then you are done with the pages, not bothering to take note of what may be asked or directed.  There are three of you to one of me, &amp; you must pardon me if the treatment is not thought by me to be fair &amp; just.  When there is a little duty to perform to an old man, who has, at worst estimate, worked hard for you a visit to a private or a public resort might be encroached upon to give him some information, he asks for no pleasure, that he has almost forgotten, in its common acceptation.</p>
<p>I have almost mind not to set down another drop of ink here, and following your example wait until five minutes before the post closes to write to you, and then end as is customary with each of you  "Oh Maria desires to go to a picture show I cannot write any more."  &ndash; Oh I am at Macdonalds the post closes in fifteen</p>
