<p>Just off the wharf, where we were counted off 20 to a small truck that in ordinary times held about 6 comfortably. Never in my life will I forget that ride as we only went about 2 miles per week, &amp; as for Rails, I do not think they used them on that line as the bumping was something awful &amp; the squealing was enough to deafen anyone.</p>
<p>Every here &amp; there along the track were small camps of Ausies &amp; the frequent cries of "Where From" could be faintly heard above the moans of the train. I dont think they got much satisfaction from us anyway, as we were just about full of soldiering &amp; we had just started. While the Sun was shining I think, to be exact, the Temperature was 129&deg;, but as Soon as the sun went down it felt about 1&deg; to us in that open truck.</p>
