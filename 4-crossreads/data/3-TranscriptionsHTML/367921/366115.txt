The trip of about twenty-four hours was uneventful except for running into a heavy sea, which made the majority of us mighty sick men.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We lay of the Wash for some hours and were then taken<br/>off in tugs (the Dutch people on board not being allowed ashore) to the railway station at Leeds, passing en route a number of fat german civilians with an abundance of luggage - going "back" in anything like the exuberant spirit in which we had left Holland.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  At Leeds, after a bit of a snack and some good old English tea we entrained on a Red Cross train for London, having our first meal (English) on the train - a big healthy plateful I of roast beef and vegetables, followed by apple pie.

We were greeted by a number of the Australian Red Cross ladies who had worked so untiringly on the organization that had kept us alive during our internment.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I well remember that the first words spoken to me by two Melbourne ladies, who knew I came from Sydney, were " have you seen our arbour".<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We were motored from the Station to King George's Hospital Waterloo amidst the cheers of a large crowd and the Guards Band playing "Home Sweet Home", - It wasn't "Home" to me but near enough,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A few days after our arrival Princess Mary entertained us at the Hospital with a belated Xmas dinner, followed by a concert.
