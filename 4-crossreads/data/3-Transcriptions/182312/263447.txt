<p>so bad going up but coming down the man above you being a sailor</p>
<p>and naturally more expert and quicker in the art, treads on your</p>
<p>fingers.&nbsp; I had an idea that sailors wore bare feet - but they don&#39;t.</p>
<p>Now we are in the foretop and ahead and astern are more ships of the</p>
<p>squadron steaming in line ahead whilst underneath you is a long</p>
<p>narrow thing slipping through the water which you know must be your</p>
<p>own ship although it doesn&#39;t appear to belong to you.&nbsp; Over in the</p>

<p>with instruments and the signallling to and from other ships continues</p>
<p>whilst the Gunnery Commander who appears to be taking no notice of</p>
<p>what is taking place round about him, tries to explain to me what is</p>
<p>doing.&nbsp; He evidently has an eye to his job all the time for</p>
<p>suddenly the ship gives a lift, there is a xxxx tremendous xxxxxx</p>
<p>drawn-out report, my cap nearly blows off and I realise that the</p>
<p>broadside has gone and that eight shots each weighing nearly a</p>
