The punishment was called right off today, so I was free to go down to Abassia to see Sep. He was on duty so we had a quiet yarn.

The C.O. had us out for Battalion drill today rather an interesting change. Then we did an attacking stunt far across the desert. Got back to camp and was picked for guard. This has spoilt my record for dodging guards.

Came off Guard and as it was St Pats? day we had a half holiday. The M.P.s were busy catching the fellows who got to town too early; but I managed to get through to Abassia, then Arch Mc, Sep, and I had our photos taken in Heliopolis.
