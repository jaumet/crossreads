fairly hard for we have been very busy.Had three evenings in town with two ladies, one of them the girl who gets my washing every week &amp; the other, her sister.The former, known to the boys as Rosey, has a young man at the front.  He was reported missing unofficially,abut  about a couple of months ago, but this week the report came through officially.She is a good girl &amp; as she was disposed to go out to cheer herself up, I saw no harm in taking her with her sister.Have also done some photography with fair success.
