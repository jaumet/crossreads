  
 sitting down writing all day without doing any exercise.  We have to get up a 6 a.m. now & have 1/2 hr physical exercise before breakfast which I enjoy as it gives an appetite for breakfast, in everything else the routine is the same as before. 
 I expect before this reaches you you will hear that I have reached England safely, as we have good protection with us in case of submarines.  An epidemic of influenza has been going round & a good many have got it.  I had a slight touch myself & was off duty for a day.  Today Saturday half holiday so we are having our usual sports in which there are some very good boxing events coming off.  The warm weather is well on us now so that the only clothing I am wearing are a pair of shorts, a singlet & a pair of sand shoes.  Today the tarpaulin awning was put up over the deck to keep the sun off.  There is very little to tell now as everything is the same every day. 
 Love & kisses to all & an extra lot to yourself. 
 I remain Your loving Son Douglas 
 P.S.  We are both stony-broke & are not likely to get paid for some weeks but what we haven't got we can't spend so we are saving a bit.  I lent 2 of my money but won't get it till we get our full pay.
