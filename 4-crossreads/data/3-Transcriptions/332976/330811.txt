<p>March 1917<br/>13th.   I have still got the five parties working &amp; have got through a considerable ammount of work.<br/>Fritz has been shelling heavily all day in the vicinity of Needle dump &amp; has done a fair bit of damage.   Another two of one of the parties were killed &amp; another had his leg taken off, &amp; last night one of my sappers in charge of a party got shell shock.<br/>At about 2.45 P.M. our artillery opened up another heavy barrage lasting about two hours, but Fritz was not slow in retaliating &amp; we nearly had our "cook house" blown to blazes.</p>
