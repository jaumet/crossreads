<p>for I hour we will have another hour of Daylight. After Breakfast 2 Chums &amp; myself went for a stroll as the morning was beautiful, the Sun was shining &amp; the air cool. I enjoyed a walk along the Wood until Dinner time. After Dinner I took my Chum for a long walk to Headley, as this place to my mind is very interesting I enjoy the walk. My Chum was very much taken up with the Village especially the Old Church which I am informed that the Tower portion is over 400 years old &amp; the Beams supporting the Roof originally came from an old Barn. This Church was burnt down &amp; rebuilt. On coming back I took a short cut which landed into private Property &amp; on apoligising to the Owner</p>
