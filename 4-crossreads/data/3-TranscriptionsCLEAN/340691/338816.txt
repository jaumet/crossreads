  
 I'll sing thee songs of Araby And tales of fair Cashmere Wild tales to cheat thee of a sigh Or charm thee to a tear And dreams of delight shall on thee [indecipherable] And rainbow visions arise And all my soul shall strive to Wake sweet wonder in  your  thine eyes 
 Where my caravan has rested. Flowers I leave you on the grass All the flowers of love & memory You will find them when you pass You will understand their message Stoop to kiss them where they lie But if other lips have loved you Shed no tear- and pass them by.
