<p>&amp; it was an excellent impersonation. There was a loud roar of a bursting shell while we were there. "The old Brig" (Brig. Gen Brand) who is a hard old case &amp; popular with the boys, came out as usual at the interval &amp; gave us the latest "oil", which wasn't good, also told us about going into the line near Corbie. When we came out, we had some fried eggs &amp; tea, I then went to B Coy. &amp; had a yarn to Boo, &amp; some of us went to look at the hole the big shell made. It was in the field &amp; just past where we played cricket each afternoon &ndash; Lor' it was awful to look at it, a huge hole in the earth you could bury a horse &amp; buggy in. French kiddies were in it after souvenirs, &amp; big clods of earth thrown everywhere. On looking at it, it makes one curse the war to think men have to face things like that, I've never seen a shell hole like it. Every one is now fed up of war, &amp; the sooner the Hun is outed the better. Slept in our clothes with the greatcoat as a blanket. Had a disturbed night, as a few big shells came right back here to the village. Friday 31 May Reveille at 4.30 a.m., we moved off at 6, &amp; did the march in the cool of the morning. The 14th Bn. were very unfortunate</p>
