  
 Each gun fired 4 charges - It's a deafening roar & your ears get touched up - You cd. see the men putting their fingers into them - Cotton wool stops the sound waves - Then we tried the Maxims - quick firers - They are like revolvers fired very rapidly - We had to go back to harbor for our speed tests for it was too rough outside - We go up to Garden Island & may not go out tonight - I got your nice letter written on Thursday & one from Turner - The few moths I got in New Britain he is sending to the British Museum he tells me - This day week is Mab's birthday - I remember as well as yesterday her natal day - I had but very little scope then for my energy & vitality & I fear I was rather a nuisance - Men with energy - unless use is made of it - are apt to become a nuisance I think - Remember that for Rawdon - He is chock full of joy & ginger & will bubble over & do queer things unless vents are found for it - Well - Mab is quieter - I hope she likes her hat box & that its all right - Mind you get your things safe & sound - Give Mab my warmest love - I am sure she will be a fine woman - Tell her from me not to worry over the future - its not in our hands - but to be quite true to the present & to enjoy life & all that comes with it - Tell R to wash his mouth out with warm water night & morng & to see Sinfield - Be obedient - clean & play games.
