<p>Saturday 19th Aout.<br/>Rained practically all day which meant mud everywhere.  Had an off day, &amp; filled the time in reading &amp; writing with a long walk after tea.  Had a (<strike>lett</strike>) letter from Morris &amp; was glad to be assured of his welfare.  When the King visited this sector, it was reported that on a certain date, some good news would be given to the Australians.  Of course we all waited patiently for the date but nothing came along so all kinds of wild rumours began to float about, such as &ndash; all the originals going back to Australia, going to garrison Ireland, special leave to England &amp; the latest came out today which was a pearl that Queen Mary had a son &amp; it was to be named Anzac.</p>
<p>Sunday 20th August<br/>Orderly Sergeant for the day.  Went to communion service at 7.30 A.M.  Rest of day very quiet.  C. Section bearers relieved B Section at the trenches &amp; A Section took the place of C Section.  Fine day but mud everywhere after the rain.  Went for a walk to near "Estairs" at night &amp; was caught in the rain but managed to get a lift home in</p>
