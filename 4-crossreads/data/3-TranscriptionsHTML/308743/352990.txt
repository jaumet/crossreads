<p>24 June 1915<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Had quite a battle with a sniper opposite but we with our periscopes sights got the beggar he was persistent &amp; a good shot. The expected attack didnt come off last night &amp; our chaps are quite disappointed. The gun opposite C is still giving the beach hell &amp; one shell got 17 of our chaps, gunboats are shelling him with 4.7 but the range is to short for they are in a pit of considerable depth. A Glasgow battery (6" howitzer) has been landed to give us a hand. The Turks gave us a pretty exhibition of gunnery, one of steam [indecipherable] was bringing in a barge of goods &amp; the Turks were trying their hardest to hit it they got within 10 yds every shot but no nearer. Had quite a lively 80 minutes Hal &amp; I went a hunting &amp; bet. us we got 50 &amp; now we have a clean change on French &amp; British still progressing favourably down at the Cape &amp; Achi is in for a lively time. We hear that we had 500 000 Turks opposing us when we landed, but how many they have now is another story.<br/>25 June 1915<br/>Friday</p>
<p>During the night we captured a Turkish patrol consisting of 1 officer &amp; 7 men, the officer informed us that they are confident if they wait long enough that they will starve us out &amp; that also we are trying to find water everywhere but without success. The Lord Nelson with her 4 12" guns &amp; 18 9" shelled Chanak from off our position for the whole afternoon. The burnt cordite formed a pall over the whole countryside, later on in the evening Chanak was on fire in many places, the Lord N had a cordon of 18 destroyers to protect her against submarine attack. A mail arrived at 5 but none for us as usual. At 9 pm we blew up a mine &amp; launched an attack to try &amp; find out the strength of the enemy, it proved successful all along the line. Went for our am dip accompanied by mine shrapnel. German aeroplane passed over at 6 pm &amp; made straight for Maidos, our captive balloon was up spotting for the L Nelson All the afternoon the Turks gave an exhibition of battery fire &amp; tried to blow up the L Nelson, also the balloon came in for its share</p>
