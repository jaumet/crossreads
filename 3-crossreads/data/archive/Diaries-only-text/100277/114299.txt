14th Up early this morning for we are moving on again, breakfast 6.30 after that we had to get everything cleaned up huts all, move off at 7.30, we marched out punctually to time skirted Poperinge" with its tall towers spires showing up nicely against the clouds, we walked steadily on spelling for 10 minutes after each hour of walking, the roads were in fine condition the weather cool I think it was one of the best marches we have done for practically never a man fell out during the 12 miles that is pretty good considering we were carrying every thing we possessed I saw Tom Flattley on the way down just over the Franco-Belgian border, we went through a town right on it "Watou Abeel" here
