<p>post next morning.</p>
<p>9th<br/>Carried under an irregular fire from the enemy all day, had a few fairly narrow escapes, at night carried again &ndash; got lost in dark, but eventually found our dug-out.</p>
<p>During the night Fritz landed one shell into the side of our dug out &ndash; another one the top, both splashing us with mud but doing no damage, same dislodging a few feet of earth.  No rations came for us &amp; it was very cold.</p>
<p>10th<br/>Carried again but very few shells came over to disturb us.  A little village to our left was shelled heavily, passed a quiet day &amp; went for rations straightened our dug out.</p>
