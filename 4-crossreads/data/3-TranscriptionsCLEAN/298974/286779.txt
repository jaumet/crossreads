 My dear Mother Here we are at an out of the way place, & I post this on chance only. The trip from the Cape has been smooth the whole way & I'm feeling awfully well. I had an absys on my tooth that troubled me with neuralgia but that's all right now. We expect to arrive in England Oct 11th Best love to all, & tell Hazel I will probably try to see Olly in the old dart but am not sure. Dene
