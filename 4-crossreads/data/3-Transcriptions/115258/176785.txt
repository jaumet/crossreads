<p>My dear Mother,&nbsp; my mail has started to arrive once more - it has all been for a trip to the Flying Corps - why on earth I dont know! some silly goat at the base I suppose - but I&#39;m sorry to hear that you were worried about my change of address when I started signalling, because as long as the letters have got ALH Regt on them I&#39;m sure to get them, and it does not matter a bit about squadron once you get known in the Regt., and especially as signaller, and especially especially when the Post orderly is a friend of mine and some times has his bivey next door to mine. My letters from home were 2 from you and Fatheron 8th Nov and one from you 17th Nov and a parcel 22nd Nov, the mail is drifting in so I expect another letter from you Mother still. I also got a letter from Aunt Katie dated 23 Nov and one from Hal 15th Nov - also tons of papers.</p>
<p>I was very grieved to hear of Frank Potter being killed. Aunt Fan and Uncle Jack will feel it and so will Robin, I will write to Aunt Fan.</p>
<p>Your parcel arrived in good order Mother, and all the home-grown things were very nice.</p>
