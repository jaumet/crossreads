 Morcourt, Bty Post, in front of. Weather nice for travelling. Left Cayeau at 8.30 am, and proceeded via Wiercourt, Bayonvillers and Eithevanem, to a position outside  of Morcourt.  we relieved the 79th Bdge R.F.A. En route I met Lance  Raymond, a very old pal of mine. Received a package of tobacco from Olive, and Young Francis gave me an Auto Strop razor. Laid O.P. and O.M. lines. Have 8 lines in use and Smithy is experimenting with a Fritz phone.
