27-3, Thursday
Had a Bath at the Charbonnage Marcinelle Nord. While there I copied the shifts as given by the act of 1889 of which a summary was posted at the Office.
Day Shift Underground
(All others work 12 hours per Shift (at least).)
Boys under 16 descend at 7 a.m. or 8.30 a.m.
They come up at 4 p.m. or 5.30 p.m.
Night Shift Underground
Boys under 16 Descend at 8.00 p.m.
Ascend at 5.00 a.m.
Above ground
Boys under 16 and women over 16 and under 21 start at 7 a.m. and work till 7 p.m., they are to have 1/8 of this time for rest or meals.
By another act 1905 it is laid down that no work excepting such as is absolutely essential to prevent damage to the plant shall be performed on Sunday.
Women work underground in the lamp room and also do practically all the trucking. It is quite a shock to an Aussie to see them all grimed by the coal dust with great heavy Sabots on their feet and their hair tied up in a filthy rag something like a turban.
