very fresh. The rain had soon cleared, and the sun shining brightly made a brilliant spectacle. One could hardly believe that such a great war of destruction was being waged less than 100 miles away. We reached Fontainbleau, a pretty town at 10 am & managed to obtain some hot coffee & had a slight breakfast. The outskirts of Paris soon have in sight    & we disentrained at Villeneuve-St George a suburb 9 miles from Paris    & waited here, dirty & tired & encumbered with all our equipment for a train. We passed right around Paris, through all the suburbs where girls were waving to us everywhere. Had a good view of Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral & other principal places of Paris. All the time along the Seine   Left a 4 pm from a Paris railway yard & from here on the French Red Cross women were grand, supplying tea at stations & doing all in their power for us. Bread
