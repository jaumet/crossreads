<p>May 1917<br/>7th   We resumed our work again to-day at the Chateau with our Bosches as fatigue party.   The School Started to-day &amp; will soon be in full swing.   The weather has been very dull all day &amp; rain is threatening.<br/>8th.   It has been arranged that a quarter of the section is to have a holiday each day &amp; this is my day off.   Rain started last night &amp; continued all through the day to our disappointment.   The remainder of the section carried on with their work as usual at the Chateau.</p>
