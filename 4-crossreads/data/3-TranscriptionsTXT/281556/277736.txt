27th. SaturdayRec'd Rations & left Steenwerk on foot about 8am. reaching Billet (Bois Grenier) at noon. Rec'd 20 letters & was very glad as since leaving London I was awfully homesick especially not knowing anyone much to travel with. They absolutely spoiled me & made life seem so miserable again for following days. I was much relieved when I got back with the boys.
