 I wonder if I'm really worth it Mrs. J.?  All the time &amp; energy you must have spent in that  "topping"  Cardigan that came today by post, it is easily the finest I have ever seen, &amp; if my thanks could only be equivalent to the comfort I shall get out of it, you would indeed feel yourself properly repaid.  I will not say any more nice things for fear of "turning your head", but just thank you again most sincerely for your kindly thoughts &ndash; and for the cardigan too. 
 But I had meant in this letter not to flatter or say nice things &amp; all that &ndash; after your success in enticing even Barrington from his retirement to hear honeyed words &amp; compliments, I thought it about up to me to act as an antidote to all such things  that  as tend to a swelled head &ndash; instead of which I start off &amp; feel constrained or rather cannot help  myself from   making you all the worse in spite of myself.
