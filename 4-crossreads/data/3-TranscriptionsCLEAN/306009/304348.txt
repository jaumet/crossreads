1915June 11 Fri.Secured the two tunics alright - they are better than the originals but can hardly be said to look respectable.Have now over 700 in hospitals. No Australians coming in - only Imperials - it appears only all former are being sent to Malta hospitals & then sent back to Egypt when alright to join new units at the Base.
