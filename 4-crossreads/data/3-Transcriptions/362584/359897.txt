<p>worries me most, is the thought that this is going to happen every fortnight. Why don't they send us to the war? I believe there is one on in Europe somewhere. Rumour has it that there is, anyway. When I started this letter, as it was Sunday afternoon, I thought I might have a chance to give you a longer one than usual, but I have just received an order to pick three officers &amp; one hundred men from the Company &amp; await further orders, so I will close here &amp; write another letter when I have a chance.</p>
