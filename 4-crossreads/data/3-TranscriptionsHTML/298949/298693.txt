<p>people sitting in Court all chatter at us, therefore the idea was to have or men, who made the complaints, on behalf of the Internees.  Representing them &amp; calling the Wittnesses, in support of those statements.  This Emde has done &amp; he has every chance, every consideration.  He dit this up to the time, when he felt he ought to have assistance. Than he wrote to the Consul &amp; asked that a Barrier might be apointed.  That request was cabled to America, to the ambassador their &amp; he has now appointed Mr Penny, not to represent Emde but the whole Internees in that camp  There can be no advantage whatever gained by anybody coming in now.  The enquire has almost finished.  Or instructions are, to enquire into the complaints made in the letter, that Emde wrote.  We have done that carefully &amp; the time will come when we will hand in our report.  Emde has represented you, &amp; represented you well up to the time when Mr Penny came in &amp; Mr Penny is hier to do justice to you, as the representative of the American ambassador the court is unable at these stage, to break into the enquirey, by complying with the wiches of these letter.  To enquire into things that are already being enquired into.
