<p>valuable estate is this part of England.   The old gentleman's father had been in charge of the gardens so His influence stood us in good stead.  The estate belonged to Lord (Colonel) Cary who died a month ago and the Cary's whose ancestors stole it from the monks.  There is said to be a curse on the place as for the last 5 generations the direct heir has died before coming into posession. The son of Colonel Cary has just been killed at the front so that the grandson will come into posession.  Lady Cary sent down to say that we were to be shown the dining room</p>
