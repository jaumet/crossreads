Orders kept on coming down every minute, some one must have had the "wind up" properly. I think Divisional Hqrs were to blame for it, however we all turned in again "full marching order" (which means in soldiers language, fully dressed) to snatch what sleep we could between 1 AM reveille", needless to say very little was got, the Band were issued with 24 hours rations were sent off in a bus to do stretcher bearing up in the line although we succeeded in taking our objectives our casualities have been fairly heavy it is reported that so far there have been 700 men 36 officers knocked in the Bde which works out at about 45% of the men engaged, but then of course all sorts of rumours keep on coming down. It rained off on last night, but this morning broke nice sunny, but this afternoon showers have set in.
I am taking a party of men up to the line this afternoon don't know what its for. 
6th Yesterday afternoon 60 men were sent up I was in charge of the lot
