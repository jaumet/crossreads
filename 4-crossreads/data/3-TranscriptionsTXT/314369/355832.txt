 Our turn at trench sapping Work the four platoons in 4 reliefs during the day. This blooming navvy work was something we never bargained for but it is as necessary as eating   &amp;  nobody ever complains 
 1915 May 24 Monday Whitsun Monday, Bank Holiday 
 We are awakened early in the morning   &amp;  told to get our breakfast as we would be burying the dead all day. A successful Armistice having been arranged from 8 am to 4 pm. The job is absolutely awful. The corpses having been exposed to sun   &amp;  rain for nearly a month   &amp;  when we attempted to move them they fell to pieces It was simply gastly searching them for papers.   &amp;  Identification discs We get an issue of rum when the job is done. R.I.P.
