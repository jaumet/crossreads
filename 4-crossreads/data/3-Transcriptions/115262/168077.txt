<p>Tuesday 6 November 1917.</p>
<p>[The first sentence struck through:]&nbsp;At 6 a.m. I.C.C. Battns got a little into touch with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bombardment by both sides is terrific. Shelling too hot so we moved our position behind some rocks. Not too soon as shells burst wlhere we had been a few minutes before.</p>
<p>Stayed there till 2 pm. when we were relieved by a group from B Section. Instead of traversing the road swept by shell fire to reach our riding camels 2 miles away we made off across the hills. Went 1&frac12; miles &amp; had to return to 2<sup>nd</sup> Battn as the shell fire was too hot even tlhere. Traversed shell swept road &amp; reached camels at dusk.</p>
<p>Returned to Clearing Station at 6 pm. Prepared a little&nbsp;to eat &amp; turned in dog tired after the first day of under dinkum shell fire.</p>
