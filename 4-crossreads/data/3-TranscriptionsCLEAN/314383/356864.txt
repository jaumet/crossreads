the main body could go thro.  I unfortunately had charge of the right flank & climbing those heights in the heat nearly laid us out.  We advanced from a flank as it were & extended taking the heights overlooking the pass from the right rear.  Then when the column had passed through we came down & followed on as a rearguard.[Sketch]The camp at night is laid out four square with gangways running east & west, north by south through the tents.  Each of the four sections are responsible for the fronts of their own area & in case of alarm each man hurries to his appointed place facing outwards.  Any height overlooking the camp is picqueted & sentries are also posted throughout the camp.  Horses are only provided for group commanders & the C.O. the remainder of us slog it on foot.
