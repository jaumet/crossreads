<p>The officers sports were continued this afternoon and afforded much amusement especially the pillow fight on the greasy pole which generally ended in both combatants slipping off into a large canvas trough of water below. There were no rules in this game, and one onlooker, a stoker who was sitting on a hatch above with his feet dangling below, frequently gave the contestant below him a push which sent him into the water. It ended by one of the officers who had been ducked grabbing him by the legs and pulling him down into the water admidst the laughter of the crowd.</p>
<p>A very good concert was held tonight in the officers mess. Major Kelly contributed a recitation, and Mr Turner of the Y.M.C.A. contributed several recitations and songs which were very popular.</p>
<p>This was the last concert and the C.O. Major Matthews who presided took the opportunity to thank all who had contributed to the various concerts during the voyage.</p>
