<p>Sunday 12 December, 1915</p>
<p>Took a regular fatige of sweeping down steps &amp; turned it in again because it was too much like hard work.</p>
<p>Had a very fierce game of cards won 10/- &amp; a wristlet watch making 22/- altogether.</p>
<p>At 2 a.m. the military police came &amp; were going to take our names for having a light burning after &quot;Lights Out&quot;. There was a terrible scatter in the dark. I ended up under someones bed with the police looking for me with matches but he didn&#39;t find me although he nearly fell over me.</p>
<p>We do lead a fast life in the Army - What?</p>
