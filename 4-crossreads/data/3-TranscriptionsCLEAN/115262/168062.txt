 Still on the move and riding the whole time with the exception of a few halts for 5 mins. or so, every 1 or 2 hrs. 
 Crossed  the  large Waddy at 3 pm and at 3.30 am halted & lay on the ground and snatched a little sleep till dawn. When dawn broke, moved to a protected position  in a ho  surrounded by hills. Prepared a little bit of something to eat. 
 Stayed at this position till 11 p.m. 
 Saddled up and under cover of dark the whole Brigade moved on till midnight. 
 Abugahylum [Abu Ghalyun] was the name of this halting place.
