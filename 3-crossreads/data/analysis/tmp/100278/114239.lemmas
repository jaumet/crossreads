 torn up sleeper smash , but wonder to say no one was hurt . I was talk to an old Tommi this morn , my feet were as cold as ice . I was tell him what a job I have to keep them warm , he advis me to rub them with rum so I decid to tri it I was astonish at the result the feet kept as warm as toast all night so far today they are warm , so now I intend to use the rum issu on my feet instead of give it away , just imagin what some of the boy will say when they see the good rum go to wast like that . Wonder will never ceas ! this even I had no less than 110 green envelop to divid among 20 men , they re fair chuck them at us now one time you could not get one for love nor money . I have myself paid 2/6 for a "greenie" , now
