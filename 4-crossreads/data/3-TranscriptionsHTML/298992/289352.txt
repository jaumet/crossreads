<p>Dardenelles, don't they? I daresay we shall go straight there, &amp; not land at Egypt at all, or any how only for a few days to get all equipment etc in order. Does Dene know when he will be leaving? I dropped into Tom's Office yesterday to see him, and he fairly gasped when he saw me. We had a bit of a yarn but I had scaled away from the Barracks to see him so I could not stop long.</p>
<p>It has been decided to move this camp to Seymour, some 50 miles further away, on account of the complaints made against it by the public. They have just had about 2 weeks rain here &amp; the place is worse than a pig sty, but I suppose you have read about it in the papers. Still you had better address my letters to Broadmeadows &amp; they will forward them on to Seymour if we have left.</p>
<p>Well, Mother, write by return post if you can, as I am tired of cadging smokes and if I have asked too many questions tell Hazel to answer some of them. By the way I did not even know she had undergone an operation, but am very very glad to hear she is right again.</p>
<p>With lots of Love to you all<br/>Your Son<br/>Alan</p>
<p>If you know what boat Uncle Jim is leaving by, let me know, &amp; any way tell me what crowd he is with.</p>
