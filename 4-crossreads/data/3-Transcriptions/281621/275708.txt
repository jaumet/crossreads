<p>Sunday 22<br/>Church parade</p>
<p>Monday 23<br/>Warned to move to another part of the camp tomorrow.</p>
<p>Tuesday 24<br/>Move to No 3 camp, 1st Command Depot, a hundred yards or so, where I believe we will go through preliminary training</p>
<p>Wednesday 25<br/>Training in earnest, physical jerks etc &amp; I think I will enjoy it, even though it is taking perspiration out of me.<br/>Loafing about makes one sluggish &amp; the jerks are just what I need.</p>
<p>Friday 27<br/>Still in No 3 camp, No 1 Command depot where we are doing physical jerks &amp; route marches daily. Saw Barnby Brown to-day</p>
<p>Saturday 28<br/>Concert at Y.M.C.A. by Lena Ashwell. Very decent, classical</p>
