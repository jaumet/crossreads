Dear Dad,
I've only about half an hour to spare as I'm on Duty till 11 p.m. or perhaps later.  I have to be up at 7 a.m. as I have to take some prisoners, our own staff, who will not play the game.  I will be in the Train all day but I've a pack of cards & 2 nice books to read so I'll do well enough.  I spoke to Dave Williams & also to Frank Hennessey.  They are both here & likely to stay here till the finish.  They declare that they have written Home.  I have proof that some 50 letters of mine have not been received in Australia so I can quite believe them.  Tell Mrs. Williams & also Mrs. Hennessey that I will give them the assurance that both are well & doing not so hard worked much easier job but fore, in fact He is with
