<p>[Sunday 26 March 1916]</p>
<p>No church parade too hot.<br/>Letters will go astray here for a while I expect, but I telegraphed for mine.<br/>I have much Office work at present, and a rotten Bronchial cough.<br/>The old 1st L.H. Brigade is very different to what it was, so many changes a man is almost a stranger &amp; naturally one misses the old faces.<br/>It is nice to hear the Squirl of the Bagpipes again at the Highland Mtd Brigade.  Bands etc have been cut out of our life for many months now.<br/>The best I ever heard was when we were played to our Camp on Lemnos Island, after the last night on the Peninsular.</p>
