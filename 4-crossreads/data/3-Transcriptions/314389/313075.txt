<p>[Transcriber's note:  Private James E. Bell arrived at Suez on 11 January 1916 and was in camp at Heliopolis until 27 March when he sailed from Alexandria, arriving in Marseilles on 2 April 1916.  From Marseilles he travelled by train to Godewaersvelde and from here was mainly in the Somme area.  As he was a Carpenter he was employed on the building of huts, stables and some furniture.  He then moved on to Harponville and worked on the building of trenches, on occasions under fire.  From there he went to Albert where he was wounded and died. He is buried at St. Sever Cemetery, Rouen.]</p>
