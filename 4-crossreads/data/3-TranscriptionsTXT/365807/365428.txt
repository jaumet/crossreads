ANZAC BAND PLAYS THE AUSTRALIANS INTO BAPAUME UNDER GERMAN FIRE
This theme will some day provide a great battle-picture for an Australian artist. The army entered Bapaume, headed by a band, between burning buildings. The picture, said the "Daily Mail," recalls the grandiose battle pictures visible in the public galleries. The Australian bandsmen, playing triumphal airs, marched through the blazing streets and burning ruins indifferent to the perils of fire, shell, and falling buildings, cheerily confident in the sense of victory.
