<p>16/1/16<br/>Through the residential quarter and clubs and past old Cairo and the banyan trees. The shops with their miscellaneous wares full of business. The Boulay quays very interesting, unloading sugar cane and a hundred other kinds of merchandise the masts of the native ships constituting quite a forest. Old Father Nile flows placidly on.</p>
<p>The road to Helouan is a banked up one winding as an avenue between irrigated fields innocent of fences. Quaint how the people let their domestic animals pasture in the crops. Reaching the town we met several animated groups, not to say crowds, of natives en fete today being the natal day of the Prophet. Helouan a quiet place gay with bouganvilleas the sulphur baths at the outskirts of the town. Circled round and then turned homewards.</p>
<p>Met another crowd with banners inscribed with Koran texts the people beating tom toms and chanting the children wearing sashes of embroidered cloth with gold figures worked thereon. Many carrying wooden swords at the 'carry' &amp; all very jubilant, one full of drugs and face smothered with white powder. Under a pall they had some tinsel images somewhat like the Buddhas I saw on the arabias in Ceylon. There was also a 'pantomime' camel two boys under a cloth from which protruded a camels head of wood. All in a state of religious ecstasy worked up by their music.</p>
