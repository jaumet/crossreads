known to the men on this mornings early parade & great was the astonishment when it was given out, as it was the last thing expected & in many cases friends of long standing were parted.  I managed to keep Cousins, Hayne & a few more of my own friends.The rest of the Company, that is the 14th have to shift out as soon as the Alexandria crowd leave.  This is a further injustice, as we have now got our Camp looking A.1. & I suppose when we arrive at Helmieh we will find it filthy.I received 2 letters to-day, 1 from Mum & Edna & 1 from Nina, but am afraid that it will be some time before I am able to write.
26.2.16 SaturdayEverything here is in a bustle preparatory to half our fellows moving out to Alexandria.We played the 7th Coy Cricket & had another win.At last my certificate has been sent along to qualify me for a Commission & I am anxiously awaiting further developments.I anticipate a very pained feeling to-morrow as our Company is to part.  Hard luck but duty is duty
