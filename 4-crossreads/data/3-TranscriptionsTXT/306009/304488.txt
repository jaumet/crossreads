 1915 Nov. 2 Tue. Have been appointed Private Secretary to the Colonel &ndash; There seems plenty of work attached to the position &amp; pretty responsible work, too. It will mean constant attendance on Col. Martin &amp; will now leave me very little spare time. Invited to a Dinner at the Sergeants' Mess to-night. The W. Officer thinks I am to be promoted to Corporal &ndash; hence the invitation.
