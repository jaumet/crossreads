<p>You will forgive this direct word but we are both of one mind about it and we know you will not thwart us. I only wish I could repay you for all you have given to me.</p>
<p>I hope you are all well there. Anna has been doing quite well and I am glad. Walter [indecipherable] has done magnificently. I hope mother is relieved a lot at his homecoming. it is best for her to return. She will have a ministry to you all &amp; you to her. I hope the old war will soon finish and I can hurl my war frame into Cairnleith for a week or two before commencing work again.</p>
<p>Love to Tout le Monde in Cairnleith. I can now say 3 words on end in French.</p>
<p>I have written to Ol.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately<br/>Rid</p>
