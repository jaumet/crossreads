<p>unsuccessful attempts  he had been working in a Salt Mine in Hanover, where floggings were daily occurrences. We were also told by eye witnesses of a certain Englishman who had I been released with a number of other Englishmen from the fortress at Cologne and sent on a working command where he refused to work and was deliberately shot in cold blood.  Another hun atrocity was the shooting of an Englishman for refusing to draw the morning's coffee, which, when parcels I were on hand, we Englishmen never touched. This incident occurred at Sene Lager.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  English food used to be smuggled in through a crack in the door whenever a sentry was on duty who wouldn't take a bribe of a bit of soap, a few cigarettes or biscuits. One amusing incident while here was when the hinges of the door to the cellar (which happened to be inwards) were removed and we used to take it in turns to visit the English Barrack for food and cigarettes.

We were sentenced to fourteen days solitary confinement after waiting just on four weeks to be tried.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Next day we commenced our "stretch in the small cells", mine was 5' by 6' and fitted with a wooden stretcher. You did your time in this manner - the first day- daylight, bread, and soup for two other meals with a mattress and blankets for the night.
