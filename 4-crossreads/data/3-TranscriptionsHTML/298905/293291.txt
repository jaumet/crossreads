<p>saw one while I was there<br/>Kelleway the cricketer got hit today he got one in the hip I believe<br/>3rd   Had a night off last night but it was not much good to me for about 1 oclock our fellows started the heaviest bombardment that I have ever heard it is impossible to picture the roar of our guns everything for miles around was all of a tremble &amp; in our billet the plaster on the ceiling started to crack &amp; fall, so you can guess it was pretty severe.<br/>The Germans retaliated &amp; shelled Fleurbaix &amp; the billets for all they were worth, they got that close to ours that we had to get up &amp; take refuge in some trenches that are always built close to the billets in case of shell fire</p>
