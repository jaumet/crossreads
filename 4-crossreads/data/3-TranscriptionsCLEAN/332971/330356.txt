ishness and goodness, and braveness that was sadness and suffering and death - when only to work was to live.  There was Fritz - to say nothing of the bitter cold ice & snow.  After 2 months my bodily strength gave out and I was sent away to the Sick Sisters at Abbeville then on to tis bit of heaven to convalesce.
Feb 8th  I have only a week more - I did hope to remember you all first but the surroundings are so charming & there is so much to see.  There was Mentone & The Italian frontier - where a Frenchman sits on one side of the soil & an Italian on the other - its separated by a huge gorge between mountains.  After some persuasion the I let us cross - write some P.C. & see an I town in the distance.  There was Nice - Monoca Palace - Monte Carlo.  The Casino & the shops are most fascinating - especially those at Nice- theres the olive wood - daum & Galle - beads - lace & precious stones - And the flowers but best of all I love the scenery all along the coast - the blue sky - the warmth & sunshine & the Sweet Scent of the Mimosa.  The hillsides are now a mass  of gold.  Then the congeniality of the inmates here & the comfort  & VAD's in all kinds of uniform - English regulars - Terrins - 9 aimnsr's Canadians South Africans Americans etc etc.
I am very much stronger physically & mentally for which I am truly thankful - And now I am going to leave you - but I ask you not cast too critical an eye on this letter.
Yours with loveAnne Donnell
