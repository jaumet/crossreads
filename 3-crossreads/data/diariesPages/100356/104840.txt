Pard gave us all his adventures of the trip to Cairo varied they were to the C.O. had as usual many narrow squeaks but came through unscathed. Went out as usual to the grove at lunch time whilst there we had a dust up with the niggers some of the boys were on their way for a swim a nigger gave a little back slack of course stopped one, another "Snowflake" came up behind our chaps with a waddy quilted Dobby, this was the signal for a general hoe in didn't we give them beans, they soon cried off, the Omdar did his nut shot half a doz of them in the boob sacked a couple of his gaffas.
Nothing happened on the way home went for a ride at sundown, wrote letters went to bed at 9.

Hopped out at usual time.
Had a revolver practice on a large scale out at the grove today as a demonstration for the niggers, some fine shooting was done the nigs were quite alarmed thought possibly that we would fire on them.
On the way home we gave many a nig a nasty turn not a few "nasty" words were to us.
Bobby left today Hal has got his job so things will be OK from this on, don't know when our new bloke comes along. Teddy sent in a complaint as to how he has been treated but I don't think he has much chance for he is rather late in the day, nevertheless I wish him luck for he has shown a dirty point.
Wrote letters. Bed 10.
