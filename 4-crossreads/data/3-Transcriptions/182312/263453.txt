<p>(3).</p>
<p>have to hurry away at once for a buss or Tube to get into Victoria</p>
<p>Station in time, he produces two other men to help him blow whistles.</p>
<p>They make Portland Place hideous with their whistles and then all three</p>
<p>come and tell me that a taxi (which I have no doubt has been round the</p>
<p>corner all the time) is at the door, having been secured at great</p>
<p>difficulty.&nbsp; My advice to Hotel visitors is never to leave at seven</p>
<p>in the morning for at that hour you catch the staff &quot;changing over&quot;:</p>
<p>there they are, both the night and the day shifts forming a sort of</p>
<p>&quot;arch of palms&quot; on steps.&nbsp; The girl at the &quot;leave keys here&quot; counter</p>
<p>grins.&nbsp; How I hate that girl.&nbsp; I get through with the loss of much</p>
<p>small change, all the while wondering how anybody could possibly say</p>
<p>that the British Nation is not organised.&nbsp; On the pavement I am</p>
<p>confronted by the &quot;superpalm&quot; in the person of the resplendent</p>
<p>Commissionaire with much gold braid and many medals (the coat with</p>
<p>medals attached I suspect as being supplied by the Hotel).&nbsp; He has</p>
<p>a huge umbrella in one hand and a mudguard in the other.&nbsp; Ha, here is</p>
<p>someone at last whom I can out-general for he hasn&#39;t got a palm to</p>
<p>spare.&nbsp; He seems to devine my intention however and in one bound reaches</p>
<p>the door handle of the taxi before me.&nbsp; I succomb.&nbsp; &quot;Where to, Sir?&quot;</p>
<p>he asks.&nbsp; &quot;To Victoria Station and tell him to drive like the devil&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I watch that taxi driver&#39;s back xxxxxxxxx through</p>
<p>the window I sort of take a liking to him.&nbsp; He is going to be paid</p>
<p>for DOING something for me.&nbsp; The idea appeals to me and I give him</p>
<p>an extra shilling or so, instead of the customary tuppence.&nbsp; &quot;Thank</p>
<p>you Sir&quot;, he says, &quot;And I hope you have a comfortable crossing&quot;.</p>
<p>Somehow I was glad to receive that old chap&#39;s well wishes, they seemed</p>
<p>genuine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scene at Victoria Station on the departure of the</p>
<p>leave train is one which has over and over again been described in the</p>
