Reinforce Coy at Matariah [Matariya]7.1.16This has been the most miserable day I have ever felt, there being a cold break wind blowing in from the Sea, which seems to cut one like a knife. The Fire holes collapsed last night & in consequence of same have had to wait until 10 am for Breakfast.The weather is playing up with our men.  19 went to Hospital & 1 was carried away late last night very bad.No mail again to-day & am wondering when I am going to get some.
8.1.16The famous 17, 18, 19, & 20th Battalions marched into camp to-day, I believe they are here for a rest.  Some of them do not number 20 of their original strength, although of course they have made them up from reinforcements.  Aeroplanes have been flying overhead all day, So, I suppose something is doing.We played an Infantry Cricket Team this afternoon & won.  The Scores were 25th Infantry 11 wickets 75 runs 20th A S Corps 6 wickets 157 runs
9.1.16
