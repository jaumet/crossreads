amply confirmed this opinion. On our immediate front was a German trench skirting along a wood which surrounded the village of Posieres, a town built on both sides of the strikingly straight Albert-Bapaume Rd., & comprising a number of houses with cellars fronting this road, veritable machine-gun strongholds which had been almost entirely responsible for the failures of previous attacks on the village. Crossing the road (to Chalk Pit) into which our trenches communicated was a ration railway line cutting across a corner of the wood & leading back along the Albert-Bapaume Rd., between it & Highcourt wood, which could be plainly seen on our right some 3/4 to 1 mile distant. Very little could be seen of the village itself, simply because, as we afterwards found, it was so battered that there was scarcely a wall left standing, with one notable exception, - the stronghold to be mentioned later. The fact that the village was on a ridge which fell away from the main road further contributed towards this.
