Saturday 17 November 1917Reported to Home sister 7.45 a.m. & sent to "Maxwell" for day?Took temps., did dressings till 1 p.m., off 2-5.  Went to 14 A.G.H., 4 p.m. tea with Cobbie, then D.3 & found Dick Rutledge, a pt. with injury to leg, looking so gay & well.Evening duty, dressings etc.  Major Farrant operates for this ward & interviews us re dressing of wounds, etc.  Capt. Mitchell is M.O. for ward.  Capt. Grant called & accused me of running away from "Connaught".  Can one wonder?Gradually we settle down to our new life but to me it is very lonely & always a longing for a real friend worries me (spoilt I fancy).  Weather cooler already.  Three weeks here today & I am the last on duty.  30 English sisters on after the A.A.N.S. & now F.E.H.
