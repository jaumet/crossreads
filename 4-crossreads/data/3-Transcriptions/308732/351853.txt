<p>a great burst of Artillery fire, but we don't know yet what has actually happened, tho' there are some wild rumors about. A number of "Tanks" came past here this morning going back, as tho' they had been in an attack. They are great lumbering things, and at a distance look like some prehistoric monster ambling along. They look as tho' they would take some knocking out.<br/>7-7-18 left our home at Glisy last night at 7.30 P.M. and came right into the front line. I had <u>heard</u> what it feels like to be a Christmas tree, &amp; now I know. We arrived at BN H.Q. were we where before going to Glisy, about midnight, and loaded up with a lot more dunage, in the way of ammunition, Trench stores, water, etc. We had a nightmare of a march from there right up to the front line, which had been advanced about 1000 yds a couple of days previously by the Brigade we relieved. We moved up along Communication trenches for some distance which were barely wide enough to let our load through, so it was a constant case of "pulling" all the time, then along our original front line, which was well supplied with obstacles in the way of loose wire, tins, lumps of earth, etc.</p>
