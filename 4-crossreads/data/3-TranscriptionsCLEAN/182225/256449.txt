NOV.   SUNDAY 26   1916
Fine & warm. We went for a ride in the Rotten Row in the morning & it was rotten row with mud up to the horses fetlocks. Mrs Angus Poss, Eric Murray, [Terry? Ferg?] Fullerton & Self went out & we had a good time. Saw Hugh McNeil, Jack Warren, Gregory, & Jack Ryrie in the row. I had dinner & spent the afternoon at Aunties flat. Untie Mabel came in & Auntie F & Self went rouond to her flat after & met the Countess of Carnarvon. Went & said good bye to Kieth later & Poss & Self got the 7.30 train to Salisbury & got a car home & were here by 11 pm. Had a very enjoyable week end
