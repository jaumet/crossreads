 9/1/18 Bath The old Roman bath seem to be veri modern judg from the exterior . All this quarter has an old world air about it and a church near by has the fli dragon wind vane familiar from those of Wren 's London church . Walk out of the town a littl way and got among what were evid billet ? plenti of sentri outsid the differ hous and what seem to be a great wast of men . The salut damn annoy , the Tommi go to great pain to salut right across the road and almost round corner . This with the bad walk and unpleas weather , drove me indoor so I return to the hotel . A fog hang over the town . Had the day been fine the view from the surround cliff and high ground would have been splendid .
