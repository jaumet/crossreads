<p>March 5th<br/>Arrived at Ashar the port as it were of Bazrah.  A long line of fine piers has been erected by the British to which are buoyed many large boats.</p>
<p>We disembark and go on to various camps.  My particular one is at Makench where some of us camp with some Tommy ASC people.  Latchford, Mills, Hitchcock, Turner, Hooper, Cameron, Stewart &ndash; Fraser and others there. The mud is a good foot thick all around &amp; a great deal of work was required before we could say that we were comfy.</p>
<p>The ASC birds seem fairly decent, their food is not of the best, but the bar is excellent.</p>
