 Monday 8th January Decided to do some shopping & bought some genuine photos of the front to send home. Weather still good & much better than I expected. I found that when indoors such as going to bed it was much more comfortable than in Australia. There in the winter one has to undress & hasten into bed, the same with getting up in the morning, but in London I found the buildings warmed so well that no discomfort is experienced at all. At night we went to the "Misleading Lady" rather good acting by Gladys Cooper and Weedon Grossmith, parts were extremely funny & I thoroughly enjoyed it. Had supper at the Hotel as I did most nights. 
 Tuesday 9th Jan. Had telegram from Will D. who was staying with friends, Roscoes at Rickmansworth, saying they wished me to go down so after lunch I went down & took cab at station for a drive
