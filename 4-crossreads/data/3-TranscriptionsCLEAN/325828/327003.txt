 My dearest Father, I am enclosing in this mail a few snapshots that I have taken fairly recently- mostly when we were in the Ypres section.  Nothing important of course but a few sidelights in our life.  I will forward the negatives on later. I am getting on very well.  Was outside for about an hour yesterday but it was too cold to be enjoyable. I received a letter from the Commonwealth Bank yesterday saying that a remittance for 12 had arrived from the Sydney Bank & was at my disposal.  This is the amount I cabled for when I was on leave a short time ago.  Thank you very much, Father dear for sending it as I asked.  It will be very useful at present as I am unable to draw any on my paybook under War Regulations I haven't heard where Walter is yet, but hope to hear very soon bow. The weather has brightened up considerably
