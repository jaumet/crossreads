19/1/17 Ribemont
Resting. Any amount of routine stuff and sent on recommendations for two commissions. Brigadier General Gellibrand and Brigade Major called in and later General Birdwood came along and had a talk. He is looking older and tired and asked how the men were and gave us a little information. Later he came inside to our mess and yarned for a while. In the evening Colonel Smith dropped in and Dr. Mollison came to mess. Went to a conference of battalion commanders at Brigade H.Q. in the evening and Mab Smith came down to our place and argued.
20/1/17 The morning was devoted entirely to cleaning up and the men were busy with knives scraping the mud out of their clothes and trying to get a bit clean but the mud is ground right into the cloth. Kit inspection also took place. Went round all the Coys. and also had a look at the raiding party. Raw cold. After lunch rode to a wood the other side of La Houssaye and Frankvillers to a school nestling in the forest and saw some tactical work. Snow still inches deep.
