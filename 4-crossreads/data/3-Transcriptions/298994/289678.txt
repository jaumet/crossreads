<p>The waterways I noticed while travelling to London struck me as an economical way of travelling, as regards goods. It brought to mind, mind pictures of Jerome K. Jerome's fascinating and humorous book "Three men in a boat".</p>
<p>The morning was bitterly cold as we made our way to the Australian Head Quarters in Horseferry Road, London. We passed through Hyde Park, now in her winter rig. We finally reached Headquarters; after a short lecture, we were free for four days.</p>
<p>The dead of winter is not the most pleasant of times to be in London, still sightseeing was my ambition.</p>
<p>I went to the London Coliseum in the afternoon, I happened to have seen four of the star turns, when they appeared in Australia. I also saw an extract from the "Better 'Ole", judging by the nice life led by Bill, Alf and Bert, the future life in France did not seem too promising!</p>
<p>London was quite dark, when the theatre performance was finished this afternoon</p>
