 that I thought I would put it in here " Imbros " Oh misti isl of Imbros Encircl by blue sea Arched over by an azur sky On thee a weari man might lie O Gentl Isle of Imbros A man might take his eas . Oh misti Isle of Imbros We look across the blue Sick men who have not eas not rest Turn wearili toward the west Oh sunset isl of Imbros We turn and look to you . Oh misti isl of Imbros We know that we must stay For us , for us is no releas Save onli death or wound or peac Oh phantom isl of Imbros A thousand mile away . " Anzac "
