 Feb. 9. the first week in February 1916 saw some heavy divisional training for the men of N.Z. & Austrn. Div. Marching out brilliantly from camp and accompanied by the Band, the respective Batts. moved out in succession of fours. Having received instructions we moved off in artillery formation & when within 2000 yds of our objective we extended to open order of fighting finishing up with an assault by storm. On Friday night at 9 we left camp & returned in the morning at 8 after walking all night & with practically no rest at all This most severe training after the strenuous work of the Peninsula [indecipherable] was unnecessary & was too much for the men's stamina
