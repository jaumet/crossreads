27/12/18 Gourdinne
Piercingly cold day. Did a short round of the billets and heavily strafed a lot of people being in an ill humour. Our cleanliness and general sanitation is bad in the extreme. From today I fancy that it will be very much better. Afternoon was too cold for sports so spent it indoors reading. Orchestra played at mess in the evening.

Steady rain falling all day. Made an inspection of the lines of ?A" Coy and of HQ. this morning. The General, Staff Colonel James came to our mess dinner at 6.30. it went off very well except that some of the youths might have got merry a bit later! Plenty of speeches and there were a few under the table. My groom ? of the night of General's dinner was Col James!
