19th. We are off parade this morning for we have no one to take on, all the men are on fatigue so the Captain said to us you can go make your rolls up if you like Sgt. so we streaked off.
This afternoon we all went down to see the semi-finals in the Brigade boxing tournament, the fights were of a very poor class were soon over, in the evening Ferguson from the A.S.C. came round to tea we put the rest of the evening in playing cards. 
20th. The Brigadier (Sticky Stevens) as he is popularly known in the Bde. was round to see the Coy do some rapid loading this morning, they shaped very well indeed, the majority of them got their 6 chips off in 60 secs which is the time laid down for this particular class of work, some of them done it in 50 secs this is getting it down to a pretty fine point, they are paying special attention now for rapid firing, in anticapation of the coming German offensive, I think it's a pretty good sound idea
