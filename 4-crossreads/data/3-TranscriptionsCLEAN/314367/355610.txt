However we're going out to-night to a better spot & our luck will be better I fancy -I got a letter of yours - 2 Times & a SMH. Yours was dated Oct 30 & has enclosures from Paulleine & Ethel about Arthur - I read them all con amore & in the Times was a lot of good stuff - I slept well last night & am quite a new man this morning & I am glad to say all my crowd are well too - They rallied wonderfully once they had discharged everything - My SBA worked hard & did good work but he dosed them on his own when I couldn't talk - I've warned the officers not to take any medicine from him on his own - not even a pill - He announced to all & several when he left G Island that he had an infallible cure for seasickness
