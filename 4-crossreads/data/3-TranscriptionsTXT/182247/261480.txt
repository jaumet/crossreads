 The Librarian, The Mitchell Library. SYDNEY. 
 Dear Sir. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  WAR DIARY  
 I am forwarding you, under this cover: 
 (a) Original hand written diary 
 (b) Typewritten diary. 
 The original diary was written by me daily during my service abroad with the Australian Imperial Forces, and, as each section was completed, was forwarded by post to Australia for safe keeping. The last section of the diary kept by me was unavoidably lost on my way to Australia but, as this only affected my sojourn at Weymouth and my voyage to Australia, its value is not very great. The portion of my diary which relates to the actual active service operations is replete in every way and is a true record of myself during those experiences. 
 Feeling that either the Mitchell Library or some other storehouse for such things might desire such material I am submitting it to you. If you can make use of either the enclosures,you have my permission to use them in any way you wish. I have bound the original of the typewritten diary for my own preservation. This version of the diary is only slightly enlarged on the original to which I have added the chronological diary at the front and a little matter at the end. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yours sincerely,&nbsp;
