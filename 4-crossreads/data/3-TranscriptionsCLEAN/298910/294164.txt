  
  Our Women  
 What made you don the karki man,    to face the shells & fumes, You who were used to lounging in    those cosy smoking rooms? What made you married men leave all    to do a soldiers part! What thought your women folk of this    the girls who held your heart, Did they by word or look or act,    beseech you not to go Did they suggest that other men    should deal the hun the blow Nay gladly they took up their Cross    the hardest part to bear And cheered you men on with a smile    & hid their great dispair.
