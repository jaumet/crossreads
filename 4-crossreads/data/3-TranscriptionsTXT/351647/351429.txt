 I know what a heart tearing biz it is to read Jock's letters when you know he has gone.  I'm still getting Jim's.  I'm still in the field &amp; don't really want to leave, while my pals are here too but if they keep on going &amp; the weather &amp; things are too awful well I dunno, I'm pretty safe as I'm not a bit brave &amp; daring.  Good night.  Love to the Boss &amp; Graham &amp; Mac also you.
