[Monday 10 July 1916]
Did the usual Reconnaissance   the 2nd Reg captured 2 Turks Killed 4 prior left another with both legs broken & a bottle of water, his mates will come & pick him up, there were about 20 on Camels in the Patrol away East.  Another of our planes came down & we rescued engine with Camels.Good news is coming from all Fronts at present, we all hope it may last, but I note the French warning not to be too optimistic.  The Pipeline reached our Camp today conveying drinking water from Kantara about 25 miles away- quite an event, as Camels have carried all our water to date.
