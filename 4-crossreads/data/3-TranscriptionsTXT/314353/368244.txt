 November 9 115. This morning at 10 oclock, in the Cemetry here, the bodies of Snowy, Heinz, and Muntz &ndash; brought down by the Bearers,: buried.  No surpliced Minister &ndash; nor even a Padre &ndash; a short service by some Captain&hellip; 
 116. The Crosses waiting here since the first stunting of Sept., Oct. taken up by Syd and Neeve today.,, 
 The wagons loaded:  they leave tomorrow &ndash; we on Sunday. 
 117. There is a tale after the manner of Boccaccio in "Sinister St."&hellip; Clarrie's blanks last night and tonight recall it&hellip;.. 
 All of us had roughly three blankets each, after an hour at the C.M.D.S&hellip;.when we put our beds down and, turned  in, one of Clarrie's was 'missing' and his complaints waxed lewd and complimentary &ndash; turning in finally with Ridge's greatcoat taking the missing blanket's place&hellip;tonight there are six blankets where this morning he had two, he 'grunted' only one. 
 Mail today &ndash; Registered from Harold of a 15/- note&hellip;  In a week I'll forward it to Bakers for Symons' "Ideas of God and Evil" &ndash; or to Beaumonts if "Herod" turns up for Masefield's "Daffodil Fields" and "Dauber".  17 days since I wrote them! 
 November 10 118. Early cold:  and raining now&hellip;  A marching order parade, full  packs up at 9.30 &ndash; inspection and dismiss:  general fatigue cleaning up station&hellip;  The wagons have left in dull horrible rain. 
 Last night the contrast between the old A Sectioniles and the new [indecipherable]:  our end of the Marquee Clarrie, Toby, Ridge, Mills and self, with the new men Harold, Tony and Galloway.  Ridge with his dry lewd humour and Clarrie's responding [indecipherable] in Toby and self&hellip;.  The rest of the tent grousing.  Harry B. deploring the horrors of service, and new opinions by new men windying the air.  Ridge is by Aristophanes. 
 Yesterday saw George Eaton, from him selection of English Prose of Masefield's&hellip; 'To-Days' he's sent on to "Muston". 
 Through the blown raining on the Marquee, the full throbbing of a new bombardment. 
 Early in the morning I dreamed of a book holding in its end pages a full list of books of verse by J.C. Squires.. of small books each of only 12 to twenty Poems.. and of a series of "Lily of Malud" &ndash; each small slim book the episode of a long lovely tale.
