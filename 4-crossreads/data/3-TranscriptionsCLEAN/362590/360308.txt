 Many thanks for your second letter which was held up, I think, by our evacuation, but followed me to England where I received it this week. 
 I wonder if you ever received my letters about Maclaurin - in answer to your first letter. I have a photo of his grave (which is on the hill named after him, quite close to where he was shot) & it is to be printed in 
 [Addendum written on side of page] As I wrote to you about Nov 16 I have some fear that the letter went down with some 20 others of mine in the mail tug which foundered on Nov 17th. C.E.W.B.
