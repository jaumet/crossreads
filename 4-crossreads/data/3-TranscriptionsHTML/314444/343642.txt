<p>So I think it best to come.<br/>Have you seen or heard anything of Oscar Watford I think Linklater is wounded. I believe they got the news a day or so before I left. There is no mistake there are a lot of men engaged at Gillapolis<br/>I hope you will like the presents and that you recieve them. Write and tell the lady that you recieved them. She put her card inside.<br/>By jove our fellows have made a name for themselves. They stop at nothing, &amp; all the time they keep on saying what about a charge with the bayenots. The Turks fear them more than the Indians.<br/>Stan sends his kind regards. Don't worry about me, because there are hundreds of brave chaps fallen, and if I go I am quite prepared to die, especially fighting for my country; &amp; I will let them know there is a Hill on the field<br/>Will write again soon So hoping you are all well love to all friends. With all my love to your dear selves &amp; Dear Dorothy<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom.</p>
