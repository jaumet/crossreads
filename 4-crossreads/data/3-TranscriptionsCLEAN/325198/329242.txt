  
 13 February, 1916 Maadi I was at Church Parade this morning & for a change went to the non conformists. The chap who was preaching in spite of his queer style delivered a good sermon.  This after noon I spent writing letters a job I don't take to easily of late. The boys did not do too well at the races yesterday - They all came home growling at the tote. Bill came out of one race 1/2 pt the better & Perce put 2.0.0 on a horse & got 10 pt in return above his stake. I heard of an officer who said he would lay 200.0.0 to 1.0.0 that we would be back in Australia within six months. I hope he wins all the money, but am thinking seriously of looking him up to have a bet with him. 
 Wonder will I get any letters tomorrow. I think that there must be a mail in. I wish they would shift us some where for a change I am getting fed up with this place & so are the rest of the boys, they are getting restless & irritable & one hears squabbles & bits of fights about - It was the same this time last year after we had been in Egypt for a while
