Jany 19174th/14 - L.H. held them up. Directly they came in touch the 4000 "dug in" & entrenched. They reckon if they had had another reg't to get round them they would have surrendered, such is their morale. Shows what ours is. Report says that when the German officer got his behind kicked, a Turk rushed up & offered to cut his throat. Report also says that the German's oppression of the Turks, makes them so willing to surrender. Subm. Busy off Port Said, Russian T.B. torpedoed & the "Ben McCrae" aeroplane sea-plane ship also torpedoed off El Arish. The "Ivernia" a Cunard Liner of 14 000 tons, a transport sunk in Mediterranean about 170 troops missing. Sgt Sim overdue his leave. Some speculation as to whether he was aboard. Do not think so as I don't think he had any intentions of returning. Bob T. rejoined unit. Aust mail (letters) in on 12th14/22nd - Lt Col Croll & Cox left Hassaniya for Hsptl T'port "Euriposes" enroute to Aust. Sent small pcl with Cox for Molly. Lyons from K139 also going. Col. gave farewell speech, usual sayings, not a brilliant orator (?) Surprised when he personally called to say "G.bye" His successor not yet appointed. Three in running Lt Col Fraser, major White (3rd INFA) & a chap from England. Tipping & hoping Lt Col Fraser gets it. Lt Col Fraser said conditions of country at El Arish much the same but 20m. beyond its mostly cultivated. Rotten winds & sand again. Hills form & disappear or alter shapes within course of a day or so. Sent films by reg'd mail to Molly, about 120 of them. Frequent rumours of a move to El Arish. Expect to move in about a fortnight or so. Nothing doing out El Arish. Reconnaisance stunts only. Waiting for rly & a viaduct
