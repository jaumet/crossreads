 JULY&nbsp;&nbsp; MONDAY 3&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916 
 A cold wind blowing all day &amp; a shower or two of rain at night. They had a couple of practise shots with the 4.7 in the [sheen/stern?]. We had some Semaphore signalling in morning &amp; none of us got on too well. Had some buzzer work in the afternoon.

 Look up and not down, 
 Look forward &amp; not back, 
 Look out &amp; not in &mdash; and 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Lend a hand.
