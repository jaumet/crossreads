  
 (9) England 
 Next morning we could see the hills covered with snow (the first snow that I and most of the other men had seen) and at three o'clock tenders came out and we left the troopship, which had been our home for so long, and went across the Harbour, landing at the Princess Royal Pier and set foot on England.  Long trains were drawn up on the pier, which we entered and then commenced our journey.  We travelled 96 miles, passing through the beautiful English countryside and villages, which were covered with snow.  At Exeter the Mayoress and ladies entertained us at tea on the railway station.  We continued our journey and arrived at Dinton Railway station at midnight.  Then marched five miles, through a snowstorm, to our camps at Sutton Mandeville.  We were billetted here in large huts with plenty of blankets and a fire continually burning in the hut.  The food was very good and we had the usual recreation huts.  For several days we were off duty as our hands and feet swelled up with the intense cold.  Then commenced drilling and route marching, through the snow.  An aerodrome was next to our camp and some of us saw aeroplanes for the first time, as there were no aeroplanes near our camps in Brisbane. 
 Mumps broke out and we were isolated for a fortnight.  When off duty on Sundays we used to walk to the interesting villages of Fovant, Tisbury and Swallowcliffe.  Also went one day and saw Wardour Castle. 
 On 16th March we went by train from Fovant to Amesbury and then marched to the main Australian camp at Larkhill, Salisbury Plains, and was billetted in No. 11 camp.  Eighty thousand Australian troops were camped here.  There were hundreds of large huts, and through them ran a large street containing halls, picture theatres, recreation huts &c - also shops where we could buy almost anything.  The drilling here was very severe and strenuous.  We were up at daylight every morning and continued drilling till dark, with half a day on Saturday and all day Sunday off.  On Sundays several of us used to walk all day through the interesting villages and explore them.  Stonehenge contained much of interest, also Figheldean, which is famous on account of the poem "Under a spreading chestnut tree".  We saw the original blacksmith's shop and the tomb of the smithy (Shepherd) and his wife in the Parish churchyard adjoining.  While here we were given four days leave to London.  The night before leaving camp we couldn't sleep for excitement at the prospect of visiting the world's largest city.  One morning we were up early and in heavy rain marched to Amesbury, where we entrained for London, arriving there at 11 a.m.  It would take me days to describe the wonders of this great city.  We stayed at the A.I.F. War Chest Club, which was run for Australian troops only, and managed by Australian ladies residing in London.  The first person I spoke to in London was an old friend (Mrs C. Jones) who used to reside in South Grafton, where her husband had a chemist's shop.  Her son was in the A.I.F. in France and when he got wounded she left Australia and came to London to be near him, and worked
