January 20th 1917.The weather this morning was exceptionally cold it was impossible to keep warm. My boots were frozen hard, & it was a painful task trying to walk. The water in our bottles was also frozen. This climate is cruel, for the last 5 days snow has been lying on the ground. As the day was a clear one a great number of Taubes flew over our way & many exciting duels took place. At 9 a.m. I left with a small party to build a new Dressing Station near the firing line. It was very difficult walking along the slippery duck boards, a frost had set in & the track of course was frozen & very slippery. We arrived at our destination about mid-day & commenced to work. Fritz did not allow us peace & quietness for long he soon sent a few souvenirs over just to greet us. A few burst near, dugouts & timber were sent many feet up in the air. I can assure you that when these d--- things are bursting exceptionally near it makes a cold feeling creep down ones back.
The cry for Stretcher Bearers went up one poor fellow in the Artillery was hit. Sergent Jeffries who was in charge lf our party bandaged the chap up. He was very cool & collected & deserves much praise as a could of shells burst near, whilst he was attending to the chap.
