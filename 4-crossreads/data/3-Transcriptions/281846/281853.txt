<p>Dear Caddy<br/>I am very pleased to have this opportunity of congratulating you, as I do most heartily, on the award of the Military Cross, which you have fully deserved in recognition of your good and gallant work for us. I enclose a piece of the riband, and with it send you my kind regards and all good wishes for the future.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>W.R. Birdwood</p>
