 ( Following paragraph is crossed out) Posted a letter to the wife from Salonika but would be no advantage posting to you so send these notes on Arrival at Alex about Thursday  next -  All dressed up in our Lifebelts again  better chance now that only 100 Officers are left on board with 2400 Tommies we had little chance. I am not sure  where  my Regiment is, but will soon find out- After 6 months have passed I shall try & get leave or a trip to Australia somehow.
