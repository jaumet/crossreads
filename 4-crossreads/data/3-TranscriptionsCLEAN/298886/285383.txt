  
 I don't know the fistic capabilities of either man but I am rather inclined No! - I must not do that I am the Referee in this case and not a punter & so I have no voice  Shall record the result tomorrow. & I only hope it will be worth recording - for the sake of posterity. It will be a great disappointment if it "fizzles out" as these I'll-see-you-in-the-morning-cases generally do. However more anon. 
 Good Night 
 24th Jan. Mon 1916. 
 As was naturally to be expected the proposed fight  did "fizzle out" as I had rather expected although the belligerents were in deadly ernest last night. I proposed at Reveill&ecirc; this morning to saddle two spare horses  and  for them to come out with me on exercise All my lads were good sports and they would have thoroughly enjoyed the fun. They both promised to come out and after waiting for about 10 minutes and keeping the horses standing in the cold I had to go out on exercise without them 
 When I got back I had to talk seriously to both of them for making a fool of me. However they didn't fight
