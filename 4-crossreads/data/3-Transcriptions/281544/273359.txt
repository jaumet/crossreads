Our Aerial Torpedo was dropped up at the top of the Yard &amp; struck the Rails between No 1 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 Roads making a hole which was measured by an Officer &amp; it was 35 ft in Diameter &amp; 8 ft deep &amp; several of the Rails were broken &amp; twisted into all shapes I had to bring along 6 trucks of Mine Earth to fill in the hole before the lines could be connected up again. It upset all work for the day up that end of the Yard.</p>
