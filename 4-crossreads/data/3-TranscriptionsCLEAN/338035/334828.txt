Had tea at a pretty set of dining rooms named Rose Cottage and then went thro' the Gardens by the banks of Thames.  It is (One particular spot reminded me of Botanical Gardens Sydney & Farm Cove.)  Thence past Hospital & through Park & back by same route.As my train went rather early for Camp I left Richmond at 8 p.m.  Back to Y.M.C.A.  Thence to King's Cross & from there to Waterloo Stn. in time to obtain a seat in my train which left at 10.  Just before we left searchlights began to play, myriads of them & very strong too and we heard that Zepps were about that and hoped we might see some fun.   But no such luck and arrived back in Camp without incident at 2.30 a.m.
Monday 2ndUp at 5.30 and at once all was bustle & excitement as we were to shift to No. 3 Camp.  And it was a brute of a day Raining all the time.Saw by papers that there was after all some fun in London & another Zepp was brought down about an hour after we left there.Going solid all morning unloading stuff at our new quarters.  Sam & I are still in same Hut (No. 13 this time) No. 3 Camp.
