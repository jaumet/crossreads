<p>Belgium  27/1/18<br/>Dear May<br/>Just a P.C. to let you know I am still going strong. I guess you will see by this P.C. that it show rather an historic building, where I put the x dates back to 1580. Contains Elizabethan panelled rooms, formerly the meeting rooms of Raleigh, Drake, Gilbert and other Naval and Military Heroes of the Armada period and is open free to visitors daily. I had a look through this old place and found it very interesting. I hope to be leaving Belgium en route for England in 3/2/19 and then to Australia<br/>Your loving Uncle<br/>Clarence</p>
