15/8/17 Etaples, Calais, Boulogne
Travelled all night in the train and did not have a bad journey as the Adjutant (a Capt. of the South Staffordshire Regt.) knew all the ropes. In the early morning we pulled into Etaples and went over to a Y.M.C.A buffet and went into the back of it getting good cocoa scones. Met one of the nicest girls serving here ? some of these women are wonderfully good. She gets up and puts up with all the roughness and hardness of the rude life. Did not stop long at Boulogne but had a good rest at Calais and during the journey had some argument on Imperial politics with the Train Con. officer an Imperial man. Reached Eblinghem and detrained walking back to Campagne via Renescure ? a pleasant trip through waving crops yellow and ready for the sickle. Found things going well but any amount of work in prospect and a good deal accumulated. Dr Craig Bunning running rave about Paris and what is to be seen there and don't intend to take any more English leave for a long time. Letters today from various folk including Ella who now is at Aix les Bains.
