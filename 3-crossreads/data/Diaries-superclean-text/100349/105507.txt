Was on deck very early; and was able to recognise many of the light houses, for this coast is familiar to me. Entered the Port Phillip heads at 9.A.M. Queenscliff and Point Londsdale look well. Went up the bay and anchored of Williamstown. There is no leave for they want to hold an enquiry into the conditions on the ship. If we were along side the pier we would soon be ashore. As it is there is much cursing and nothing to eat. We will stay here all night.
