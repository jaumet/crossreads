<p>to spend a few days at her home "Holcombe", Westcote, Dorking, Surrey, at any time after the 20th. November. She is at present away in Scotland. I will not be able to avail myself of the invitation as we will have left here by then. I am writing to her and Mrs. Joubert thanking them.</p>
<p>Monday 23rd.<br/>Captn. Rosenthal went on leave early this morning. I am looking forward to going on Wednesday morning. If the money I cabled for arrives I will probably visit Dublin otherwise I will spend my four days in London.<br/>The letter you spoke of telling me of father's illness has not reached me yet. It must have gone astray in the post along with the parcels you sent. I trust that all at home are well and that father's health is fully restored.<br/>With best love to all at home and next door<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Eugene.</p>
