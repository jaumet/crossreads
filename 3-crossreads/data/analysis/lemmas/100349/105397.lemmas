 side is frozen solid . There are block of ice in the shell hole six feet thick , and everyth is as still as the South Pole . 1st Februari . 1917 . A quiet day and night but it is fright cold . Twenti degre of frost I am told . Our music Hun in the post opposit had booz ; they were veri jovial , one wave a bottl at us invit us to drink . There is one strand of barb wire stretch along the middl of No Man Land to prevent eithersid from get lost this snow is veri confus . This is a most extraordinari sector , here we stand all night in full view of the Fritz 's , yet we dare not shoot at him or he at us . I hope to hear the Bosch sing the Hymn of Hate , befor I go away from here .
