  
 Saturday 1 December 1917 
 Saw 2 whales this morning & these would make a good camouflage for subs. I got the wife up at 4.45 a.m. as we are now in the midst of the vermin, just outside  GIBRALTAR . Other escorts have joined including a  U.S.A. T.B.D. . It is not a good thing to stay long in the BATH  & other places of convenience with the  door locked. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.] I have just been yarning to an Italian Officer he blames his Government for sending the TURIN rioters to the one front, where they fraternized with the enemy & sold ITALY a PUP.
