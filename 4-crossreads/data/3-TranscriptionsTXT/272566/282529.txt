 Tuesday 27 March 
 Snowing &amp; cold outside. More explosions in Bapaume.  Other cellars have gone up into the air, one being a Staff billet.  Here a number of German Prisoners had just been examined and had been taken about 20 yards from the cellar on their way elsewhere when the explosion made them turn round.  They burst out laughing when they heard the facts.  Orders reached us tonight saying that we have to evacuate this post and report to Capt. Marshall at the Collecting Station Beaulencourt tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.  So we have to break up the happy home.
