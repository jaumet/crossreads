<p>Department of Defence<br/>Melbourne 15th December 1916</p>
<p>Dear Judge Ferguson</p>
<p>At the suggestion of Colonel Anderson, Commandant, A.I.F. Headquarters, London, I am forwarding you the correspondence that has passed in relation to a request that was made to me, not by you, for the employment of your son on duties away from the firing line. I thought you would be relieved to read through this correspondence, &amp; when you have done so, I should like it returned to me.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
<p>G. F. Pearce</p>
<p>The Hon D.G. Ferguson<br/>Supreme Court<br/>Sydney N.S.Wales</p>
