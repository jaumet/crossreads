You can see the spire of the old church of Durrington and also at Netherhaven, where the church there&nbsp;is really a beautiful little sanctuary. Through the glasses you can pick out the old cemetery where so many of our lads lie in their last sleep, many thousands of miles away from home, yet heroes none the less. One can trace the row of trees that line the little River Avon that runs through Amesbury and that I know so well. It was quite a sight to see it all again and full of pleasant memories, and of all the ways we had seen it, in summer, spring, winter and Autumn: who could forget those dismal winter days when everything was a cloth of beautiful white, intensely cold and miserable but with a grandeur about it one could hardley describe: The trees with their branches all bowed down and whitened by snow; again in Spring with the beatiful green grass; the wild flowers, primroses, wild violets, poppies, and the numerous and many others; and now as the plains are to be viewed with their first turning autumnal hint that is perhaps the most beautiful time of all in my opinion to see England. Acres of that beautiful golden red and brown tint lightened by yellow, make the whole place seem bright in the absence of the sun; The beeches turn so early and are such handsome trees at all times; and the dark green of the more sober and spreading Yew tree also stands out pre-eminently amongst all the others. I have spent many a pleasurable hour wondering around these plantations, and amiring the beauty of the different tinted foliage; and occasionally a hedge of sloes&nbsp;or Blackthorn&nbsp;bars your way that no one can get through for their thick thorny branches. There is a splendid crop of sloes all around</p>
