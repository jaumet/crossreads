"Il Balen del suo Sorriso"Il Trovatore
All is hushed save night winds stealingO'er the lime trees and the riverSounds that called up gentlest feelingNow have lost their charm for everThe loved haunts then fraught with gladnessCan to me no joy impartMemory brings alas but madnessIn the tempest of the heart
Oh could I behold those glancesBrighter than the stars above theeHear the voice whose sound entrancesBreathing forth the words "I Love thee"
