great size & Cheops covers about 10 acres of ground & is over 400 feet high & over 3000 years old. The next striking sight to their siz  is the weather beaten state they are in. In places the rocks (21/2' square blocks approx.) are loose & have been misplaced.
The entrance to Cheops is in the centre of the nearest face to the tram. We did not go inside so cannot mention that yet. Many soldiers had climbed & were climbing to the summit but, I did not feel quite strong enough. Camels & donkeys & Egyptians abound here, The latter pester one to death to come inside for "5 disasters". One can go inside for nix, & instead of paying a guide, just hang on to the ones who do pay, it is just as good.
