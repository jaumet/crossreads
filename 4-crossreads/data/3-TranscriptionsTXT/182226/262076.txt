 Wednesday 23 February, 1916 
 Started digging gun pits. We are digging No 1 Position it is on the left of &quot;B&quot; Company&#39;s trenches. There are four of us &amp; the Sergeant. We have a mile walk from the camp before we start work - full kit - &amp; a walk of the same distance back. An engineer is in charge of the job. 
 We had our half holiday &amp; we needed it, it is hard work shovelling sand.
