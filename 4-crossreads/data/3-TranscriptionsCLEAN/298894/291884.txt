Sighted some islands expect them to be Fort of Java.  Several tons of potatoes condemned  smell something awful had no idea potatoes could smell.  It has rained at various times a little finding its way into the Hospital.  My only trouble is biliousness owing to lack of exercise, my leg still bad although its 3 weeks today since I hurt it  Sunday 28  Fine day.  Passing Java.  Very mountainous.  One Peak we saw soaring above the clouds was Simaru 1200 ft high  Shaped as a pyramid & a beautiful sight the peak far above the surrounding clouds.  The coast line rugged & broken & being very high seemed intermixed with clouds.  Attended service at night  hymn singing.  Feeling much better in health.  Had rather a funny case to the doctor today.  A fellow came in with a very forlorn look & said I've a bad throat pains in the head & back an awful cough  a touch of indigestion and I cant ------  he ended up with.  The Doctor sat back & quaintly remarked H'm, you are what one might call B-----------d then.  1st March.  Small operation today on a G. patient
