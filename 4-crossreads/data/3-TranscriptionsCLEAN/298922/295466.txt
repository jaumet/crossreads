  
 Sunday 20 May 1917 
 Went to Church Parade, didn't feel much better as ears were full of sand from Khamsin. Am now killing Flies  by  with some Tanglefoot on knee, 20 dead. A big Mail has been lost at sea so the letters  from the wee wife  are lost I expect. 52 Flies now dead. I do wish I could get a photo of the Squadron in their GAS HELMETS. You will see the same in Illustrated English Papers. Lost count of dead Flies!!!  but  Insecticide is good stuff to send. Fly Paper one is apt to sit on!!!  But all these things can now be bought at the CANTEEN at Railhead. Getting to it is the trouble.
