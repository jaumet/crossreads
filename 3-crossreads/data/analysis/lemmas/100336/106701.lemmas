 Short after this as we were walk down one of the lane separ the garden , we thought we saw a Gendarm , so we thought it best to give him a miss if possibl , so we start off across one of the garden . We had not gone far when we heard somebodi shout after us to stop . A man come run after us and want to know what we were do . We told him we were German and want to get out on to the main road for B Bozanti . This did not seem to satisfi him but he said we would have to follow him . We protest on the ground that we were German , but the bluff did n't come off here . He commenc call out someth in the direct we had seen the gendarm so we thought it would be best to go with him , which we did . He took us befor a big fat Arab , sat on a mat smoke one of their favourit pipe . Judg by his appear he was somebodi of import probabl the landlord of sever of the garden . He eye us off veri suspici and then enquir tho we were . We told him the usual tale , he said if we were German we should be on the road lead into Messini , which of cours was correct , but we told him we had lost our way and were look for the main road , lead to Bozanti ( The German Headquart ) . He said no more but sent for the Gendarm to escort us into the main road lead to Mersina which he did . We follow the road for a short distanc and when we were out of sight turn off again through the garden for we did not want to go into a big town like Mersina as there were a number of German soldier there and we should not have been abl to bluff them . We must have been watch for the Gendarm came run after us . We immedi stop and when we came up to us he immedi accus us of be English , which we immedi deni . I think it was onli the prompt way we repli that we were German that save us , Howev he said no more but show us on to the road again . We follow the road for some distanc this time , and then just as we were on the outskirt of the town and it was draw into dusk which was in our favour we turn off the road again and got well clear of the town without be question again . We were dead tire and hungri after our excit day , so we select a spot to spend the night . We ate most of the fruit we had bought , just leav suffici for the morn and then we lay down to sleep. We had not been there long when my mate was stung with someth , probabl a spider or a small scorpion . Howev it caus him a good deal of pain . We decid we would shift a few hundr yard further on which we did , and pass the night without further mishap . We were awak at daylight and found we were on a flat stretch of countri with just a farm hous here and there and a small rang of hill to our left about 8 mile from the sea . We knew this was somewher about where the Greek had mark his Father 's farm on our map , but we had destroy the map when we reach the coast so that in the event of us be caught they would not know who gave us the inform .
