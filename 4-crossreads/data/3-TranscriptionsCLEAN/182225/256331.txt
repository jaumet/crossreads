JULY   MONDAY 31   1916
Fine & hot. We had some battery standing gun drill in morning, with coats representing the different stations. The headquarters were signalling all day with flags & heliograph. I had a wire from Mother to say she was coming down to Salisbury today.
The 27th Battery went on duty at Six oclock tonight, but as luck would have it I did not get on any duty.
