By end of July 31/2 miles of trench was deepened to 5' 6" deep & 5 feet wide while 11/2 miles of new trenches were dug.  A saw mill at Heilly was operated by the battalion under Lt Hassall - timber being felled near the river floated down to the mill broken down & sawn into suitable sizes  in all some 40,000 lineal feet was thus dealt with. Just before leaving this sector 'B' & 'C' Coys took part in another operation near Morlancourt where trenches leading to the captured positions were again successfully dug - 'C' Coys work under Capt Buchan on this occasion being particularly fine.  On the 30th July the battalion moved out of this sector back &after one night at the to its old camp at Bussy-les-Daous.  after one nightHere a thorough rest was indulged in, bathing concerts, & sports meetings being regularly held.  It was evident however that from the amount of movement of guns, tanks & transport generally that was taking place at night that some big movement "stunt" was pending.  Rumours of all sorts were naturally current but strict secrecy was kept & all ranks were much relieved on Aug 7th when it was announced a move forward that night was announced to a bivouac just behind Villers Brettoneux which was to be the assembly position for an operation on a unprecedented scale to take place at dawn the following morning.
