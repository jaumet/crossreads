<p>6 p.m. (?) &amp; have been slogging along all day without any drink for the horses &ndash; in the 12 hours today we have covered about 22 miles &ndash; many horses absolutely 'pulled right out" &amp; an occasional gallon of water had to be given them out of our emergency ration to keep them going.</p>
<p>But Thank God after 36 hours without watering &amp; covering 32 miles on a bad desert track very heavy going &ndash; we have reached a good waterhole &amp; I though they would never stop dinking all had a good feed of <strike>corn</strike> barley &amp; bran &amp; little chaff &amp; they are very quiet now</p>
<p>While we halted at midday 2 armoured cars of the RNAS Cars [Transcriber's note: cars of the Royal Navy Armoured Car Division]</p>
