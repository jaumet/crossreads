<p>&amp; bitterly cold the whole ground being frozen over at 9am when the parade was in a flight of 5 German Planes came sailing over &amp; immediately started bombing us &amp; the various camps round. We all scattered &amp; waited for them to go. They dropped a few bombs close to the road &amp; then started with their machine guns. This was worse than the bombs &amp; we spent many anxious moments. Our guns now got busy &amp; turned them, when our planes appeared &amp; drove them back. All day long we have had to watch the sky, but our planes have managed to keep them back except in isolated cases.</p>
<p>At dinner time Fritz opened on us with his long range guns, evidently on information provided by the planes &amp; got all round us. One shell hit about 10yards from a full parade of mule transport men, but did no damage.</p>
<p>Another fell among horses &amp; caused some little confusion. Altogether it had been a very discomforting day &amp; once more I must say that we will be lucky to come out of it unscathed. Many big guns are taking up position close by us, which does not tend to make one easy in mind as they are sure to search for them when they open</p>
