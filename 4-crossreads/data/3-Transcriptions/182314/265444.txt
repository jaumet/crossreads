<p>[Indeciperhable] Platoon&nbsp; [Non?] commissioned Officers</p>
<p>X Lowther.</p>
<p>Platoon Sergeant. He is a man well up in his work &amp; well able to detail [indecipherable] to his men. With an old [indecipherable] man over him, He has good control over them but this control disappears when he is left to himself. He is keen on doing well. At times I have found him unreliable, generally this is not so. He is slightly superior to the general run of N.C.Os [in comportment?] at present he is at the officers [block?]</p>
<p>X Thompson. Sergeant.</p>
<p>Absolutely incompetent. Too young no personality, no control, &amp; unreliable.</p>
<p>X Finlay. Corporal.</p>
<p>Trustworthy, well educated &amp; reliable has a good knowledge of his work &amp; fair control over men. His youth &amp; his absence of a strong personality are the only blemishes in a first class N.C.O.&nbsp; can safely recommend him for promotion.</p>
<p>X Jones. Corporal.</p>
<p>Trustworthy &amp; reliable, has a fair knowledge of his work &amp; fair control over men. With a little more experience he will prove a most useful N.C.O. in every respect.</p>
<p>Andrews. Lance Corporal.</p>
<p>Trustworthy, conscientious &amp; reliable an excellent N.C.O. with good control&nbsp; could well fill a position of higher rank.</p>
<p>Masterton Acting Lance Coproral.</p>
<p>Trustworthy, most conscientious &amp; reliable [indecipherable] a fair knowledge of the work of an N.C.O. but very keen. recommend his rank be continued.</p>
