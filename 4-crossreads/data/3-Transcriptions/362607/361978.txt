<p>Bulford<br/>7.10.17<br/>Dear George,<br/>Another view of lovely Bournemouth. Every sea side Resort has its Tower Clock on the Pier Head. You will see the Tower at the Bottom of the Cliff. I took a snap of the Pier from the Rail where you see the man Walking, but I do not know how it will turn out yet. I had a swim &amp; went out for a row for a couple of Hours. Winter is on us again. I did not ride to Salisbury. I could have had no hear, hands or toes left if I had done so. This place is not a bit bigger than Manly but it has a dozen Hotels like the Pacific  but surrounded by lovely gardens &amp; lawns &amp; Tennis lawns etc. Electric &amp; Cable Trams to all the surrounding Districts too. Shops as big as Whites &amp; Stewarts put together. Well, George there is no news at all. This is only to let you Know that we are both doing well. Regirds to all the Boys &amp; to all our Friends round about.  Your loving Brother  Harry</p>
