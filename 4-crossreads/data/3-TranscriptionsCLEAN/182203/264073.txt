We have expected to leave everyday but now think it may be to-day or to-morrow. The weather has not been so wet nor cold this week & we have been out everyday.I wrote a long letter to you on 7th Sept so shall tell you what I've done since.Thursday went to Kew Gardens, they are most perfect, of course we did not go all over them, they are huge. Anyhow we spent 3 or 4 hrs & thoroughly enjoyed them. The flowers magnificent, the coloring so different from the Egyptian - the lovely soft pink, blue & heliotrope & the lawn the most beautiful soft, bright green & the trees
