a move on, and we had to wait for them, and then after travelling about a mile, we had to wait another received orders to wait and allow the Brigade Transport to pass, which took another hour. Twelve o'clock was blown on the Rishon le Sion wine cellars whistle before we finally got a move on.
Such is the glorious uncertainty of Military movements. At twenty past two by the clock on the great on the tower of the Great Hospice of St. Josheph [Joseph] of Arimathea in Ramleh, where during the siege of Jaffa, Napoleon and his staff lodged in 1799, and the Church was changed into a Hospital, now it has become a H.Q. for us and also a hospital for our boys, we were passing the front entrance of that place, with the celebrated Tower of the forty Martyrs on our right, behind us the stately ruins of Cour de Leon's Church, on our left the Great Church, dedicated I think to St George and all around us the immense olive gardens surrounding Ramleh.
