<p>1915<br/>Aug. 13 Fri.<br/>Last night we received a big batch of Reinforcements to the Unit from Australia:- 8 Officers, 4 men &amp; no less than 50 Nurses.<br/>About 60 patients in the Hospital unfit for further service left for Australia this morning &amp; with them 2 Officers, 10 men &amp; 5 Nurses as Staff on the Hospital ship Thermistocles. This is about the sixth batch of our own Unit that have gone &amp; I feel very much like putting in for the three months trip, sooner or later. There is not much chance of No. 2 G.H. running away from Egypt until the Dardanelles operations are  brought to a finish.</p>
