  
 were told to go back to our respective Coy's on the way back I had to pass the Capt dugout & he called me in & asked me how things were going I told him, & he said he was going down to Bn. Hqrs shortly & he would have a word with the Colonel, what kind of a man do you think he is, & at one time he & Len & I were bitter ememies but what a change, now he is taking a great interest in us.   What a fine thing it would be if both of us could get our commission I dont care so much for myself but I know how all at home would like it to come about wouldn't they feel proud & it would be a very good record
