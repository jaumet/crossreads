 I was lucky to get this leave, as in a way it is &#39;buckseech&#39; turn out. A prisoner had to be escorted to Port Said and from there the escort could get leave - the prisoner, by the way was a man who had accidently wounded himself  and &nbsp;but had made a false statement about it and got 28 days and we had to bring him down to put him on the boat for Australia. His name is McEwan and his father owns a pub in Gulgong. Our asjutant knew the signallers had not had much leave, so he offered the job of escort to another chap and myself and  he  we snapped - I told him I wanted to get my pivot tooth fixed so he gave me a letter to the boss Dentist Cairo and unofficially advised me not to present it till near th end of my leave, so I&#39;m going back up to Cairo about Wednesday to try my luck, and hope to get either some more time there or else be sent down to the 14th to get the tooth fixed there.
