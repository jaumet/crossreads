my head 50 times a day & have to crawl in backwards.
The water leaks in & I have to bail out at intervals but its pretty warm & not draughty.  At present I am writing there and at intervals of three minutes a German shell goes whistling over head to crash about 150 yards or so on.  Sounds so thrilling, but I wish he'd stop.  I can't help wondering if he will shorten up some day, the brute does this every few evenings.
One of my protegee's got bunged yesterday, poor beggar he'll lose his arm even if he gets over it.  He I was going to get him a billet as married overseer on Bringagee after the war, & now I'm afraid he can't be an overseer with one arm, he couldn't catch sheep or class them or do windmills &c., &c. could.  Poor Edgar he was or is engaged to a nice girl too.  I haven't heard of Tom for ages, we dodge his crowd very successfully.  Duncan Macfarlane rode over to see me a day or so ago.  He loves being an Ossifer in the R.F.A. but he gets no more pay than I do.
