<p>Le Bizet<br/>of Trenches, C.11.d.65.56.<br/>Enemy's Artillery and machine guns were quiet during the day.  The latter showed some little activity during darkness.<br/>Weather conditions were wet, dull, and poor visability.<br/>Further investigation of the shoot reported on the 10th was found to be directed against an overland track in the rear of our battery.  As the shoot was at dusk, it was probably made with the hope of catching some people on this track.<br/>In accordance with Divisional Instructions, C.O. visited the Field Punishment Compound at Bailleul and was made conversant with the method of carrying out both F.P. Nos. 1 &amp; 2.</p>
