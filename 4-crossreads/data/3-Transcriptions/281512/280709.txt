<p>3rd October<br/>Went to headquarters &amp; photographed the 1st Anzac Staff. I met General Birdwood who spoke with me re my resignation &amp; he said he hoped to fix matters up. I am however, inflexible, &amp; if my end be not obtained under no consideration will I retain office.</p>
<p>I remained at Steenvorde all day, taking a rest cure. The battle is to come off tomorrow when we intend taking the ridge in front of Zonnebek.  The weather is becoming very wintry &amp; considerable rains fell during the night. Given two fine days &amp; we will gain our objective beyond doubt. The mass of artillery is appalling &amp; nothing can withstand against it. Our supplies of shells &amp; munitions is endless &amp; one cannot but feel sorry for the wretched devils on the Boche side. Germany cannot win &amp; might just as well give up,</p>
