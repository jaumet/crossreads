<p>My dear MacLaurin</p>
<p>I was so glad to get your letter.  I thought it was of public interest, so I took the liberty of handing extracts to the papers, without mentioning names.  At the same time may I say that over here we are rather bewildered at the idea that seems to prevail in Egypt about the effect of Bean's letters.  Of course there are always some people who are ready to jump to conclusions to the discredit of anybody, and I suppose there are some people here ready to believe that the Australians in Egypt have been misconducting themselves wholesale, just as they would believe it of anybody else with or without evidence.  But don't think for a moment that that is the general <strike>idea</strike> view, or even a wide spread view.  By the time this reaches you, you will probably have much more serious things to concern you, but if the matter continues to be of the slightest interest, pray let it be known as widely as possible that nothing has happened to shake our affectionate pride in the boys who have gone overseas with our honour in their keeping, or our calm confidence that wherever they are they will do credit to themselves &amp; Australia.</p>
<p>I am writing just as the big fight on the Yser seems to be turning in our favour.  We don't know where you are, but we strongly suspect that you are somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Dardanelles.</p>
<p>On Saturday we had a march of the 5th Brigade through the city &ndash; a very inspiriting sight.  It was called a farewell, but we don't know when they are going.  I had a personal interest in it, as Arthur was part of it.  He held back till his mother &amp; I had been some weeks in Tasmania, &amp; he learnt that she was much better for the trip &ndash; then he wrote to us a letter in Melbourne which left even her no wish to do anything but wish him</p>
