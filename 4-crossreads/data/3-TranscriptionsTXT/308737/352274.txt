There was some excitement in Cairo the other night, in the shape of a riot in which only soldiers took part. It was a disgraceful affair &amp; was started by some drunk infantryman. They made a raid on a block of buildings in the heart of the city, which were mostly houses of ill fame &amp; threw out all the furniture &amp; stuff, &amp; made a huge bonfire in the street. The permanent military police turned out but could'nt do anything. They fired on the mob with revolvers, only two or three shots &amp; wounded a couple of chaps. Finally things quietened down &amp; now its long forgotten. Mick Shanahan (note the name) is our troop leader &ndash; a lieutenant - &amp; happened to be in town at the time. Mick cant keep out of any scrap, &amp; would'nt miss it for worlds, so he weighed in &amp; took about 10 rioters at once.
I wish I could have seen them before they went. Well darling I'll close now &amp; write a couple of post-cards to the kids. Write as soon as you find time &amp; let me know how everything is getting on &amp; send more photos.Best love mormy dear from your boy John
