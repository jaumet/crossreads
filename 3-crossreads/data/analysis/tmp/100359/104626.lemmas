 How these poor devil of infantri men stand the strain is beyond me . We arriv at the A.D.S. about 4.30 and veri soon got outsid some Bulli Beef and Bread as we had not had anyth to eat sinc about 7 a.m. just to our left is High Wood and to our right Belvill Wood . Both the scene of fierc fight . There are thousand of grave about , with cross made out of amm . Case and ani old timber avail and most of them have hat or cap hung up also . The ground is shew with shell , ( both German and our own ) rifl , coat , bayonet , overturn gun and last but not least we saw a tank . It was part buri in self mud , and was an object of much interest to us . It is certain beyond me to describ it , but is a veri weird look object and no wonder the Hun could n't make it out . It is driven by motor engin and instead of wheel , it has big caterpillar with which it clamber over trench or ani other old thing that come in it way . The tree in the wood are without leav or branch , and look just like so mani old post stand out of the ground . The 98th F.Amb . is carri on the A.D.S. which we are to take over tomorrow . There are hundr of aeroplan about and they hover over Fritz 's line as cheeki as sparrow . We are all camp in a big tent . The mud is ankl deep insid it , so we went over to the Amm . Dump and got a pile of empti case to put on the ground . It made a hard bed but it was better than sleep in the mud . The Corp. Cook of the 98th made us some cocoa for tea which was a great treat . We sat round his fire and had a good warm till he sent us off , then we went to Bed , Four of us slept as close as possibl . First came Mac , then Myself , then Billsi May and last Roy Knowl . " Billsi " is nice and fat and kept us all warm . We did n't get much sleep as the gun made such a terrif din , and at time fair shook the ground . A few shell lob veri close but nobodi was hit .
