29/3/18 ? La Basse Ville
A quiet day. The B.M. came in for a private conversation and got some plain home truths and a little good advice. Later went to Bde. H.Q. and there met James, Duggan, Braeznor and the General. The latter had just returned from a Conference presided over by General Plumer and consequently we heard much of interest including the order of battle of the Hun as well as our own. Went up the line. It was pitch dark and wet and had two little Company conferences passing on all I had picked up there. Everyone up the line is in the highest spirits
