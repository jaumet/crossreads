  
 Then we were in rest for few days & soon the Hun retreated.  we were ordered in but could not get within range owing to the bad state of the country.  However we eventually reached "Bullecourt" where the battery was in action from 3rd Ap to 26 May. Leaving Bullicourt we went on a flying trip to Messines 90 miles north by train the outcome of that was the Messines engagement on June 7th. The next appearance was at "Spoilbank" on the banks of the "Ypres Commines" Canal this was very rough tournout while in its infancy was called by the British press the "Battle of Flanders".  However we lost very bad & nothing more was said about it in the papers. We then had a fly in trip to Warneton in Messines district to support our infantry in a minor attack there.  We then marched out for our long promised 3 months rest.  After five days we eventually finished up in the "Menin Road & Paschendaile"
