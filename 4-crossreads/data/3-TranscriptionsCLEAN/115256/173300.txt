Wednesday 10 February 1915
To-day, the first divisional concentration was held.  Reveille was sounded at 5.30 a.m., and by 7.45, the four battalions were formed up on their respective parade grounds, ready to move off.  Shortly afterwards, the Brigade, headed by the Brigadier, Colonel Monash, on foot mark you, set out on its march for a large parade ground on the outskirts of Cairo, a place called Ab ...  It was not a long march, but the walk worked up quite a ruddy complexion on the face of corpulent and rather ponderous Brigadier.  Shortly afterwards, the New Zelanders, [Zealanders] the Light Horse Regiments and the batteries of Artillery put in an appearance, and the division was complete.
After a sumptuous repast of biscuits and cheese (we shall be lucky to get that in a few months' time), we had a march of a few miles in another direction, and finally returned to Camp at 5 p.m.
This evening, the 13th Battalion band gave a band concert in the Y.M.C.A. tent which was greatly appreciated by the troops.  Our band is, at present, the crack band of the military forces in Egypt.
