<p>be next to go there. We quite expected to be away long before this &ndash; but no good worrying &ndash; things will soon come <strike>wri</strike> right. "Anzac Day" on Tuesday &amp; Fred is giving a dinner I was to have gone but have had to ring up &amp; tell him that I could not go. We shall have a little dinner of our own. They have not met yet but shall soon. I'm sending a few more snaps home soon. Hope you get them safely. Trust you are all well &amp; had a good holiday. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. Hope you all &amp; Lucy are friends now. From, your loving sister, Edith</p>
