8/9/19 Sydney
past Milsons Point and passed the "Australia" looking very spick and span, some submarines and a number of other war boats. About noon we berthed at Dalgety's wharf. Undoubtedly Sydney is a lovely place. At 2.30 went off with Maclean Miles and walked up through fine business streets to the Hotel Carlton then to Circular Quay and afterwards to Victoria Barracks. Dined with Captn Young tonight at the Carlton. A smell of boronia everywhere. Impressive free and easy waiters, no "Sir", no excellent attention. Dowdy look of people at and after dinner owing to lack of evening dress. Bad service in bars and barmaids. No elec light at bedhead. Good food and wine but not enough forks c. Bare comfortless lounge.
