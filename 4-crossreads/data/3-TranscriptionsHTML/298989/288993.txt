<p>22/2/16<br/>Great improvement in early morning work, 10 minutes saluting is included with great advantage upon the programme. Our times for parades from tomorrow are to be 0630 &ndash; 0700 0830 &ndash; 1130; 1300 &ndash; 1600. The days are becoming longer and decidedly warmer. The trees and cultivation along the Canal showing up very distinctly today. At 0900 went round the outposts with the C.O. and fixed up permanent latrines for them. Big parties working on barbed wire. After taking out details, Sigs. m.gunners, bombers and engineers fatigues besides supplying our outposts there are not many men left. Made up Courtmartial papers for [indecipherable].</p>
<p>After lunch went round the line again and also with Smith after tea. Hard to find picquets and groups in the dark and sentries very alert. "Halt! Hands up!" "Advance one and be recognised!" "Pass". At 1806 heard a shot fired about a mile off about S.S.E.  Had afternoon tea with the Brigade Staff, it is proposed to give us 3000 gallons of water to allow a reserve to be held. Padre went up to Cairo. Bladen says he was passing a group in the 23rd and he heard one man say. "He's not a bad old b--." "Yes!" said other "he's a decent old b--." Read in paper tonight that Belgian officers kissed ours in Flanders. Dr. Craig "Another of the horrors of war."</p>
<p>Rumoured today that we will not get any of our men or officers back from the school of Zeitoun also that 16 new battns are forming at Telle Kebir and 500 from the 16 Batts. of the 1st Div are being taken to stiffen them. Persistent rumours we are going to France. Reported that Fethers is not getting a battn after all but is getting a staff job. Lots of furphies but no dinkum. They don't know as much at Bde HQ as we do.</p>
