<p>in correct battle formation we stormed an imaginary objective.   No opposition being put up, we were completely successful.</p>
<p>Alan &amp; I later went over to one of our observations balloons &amp; made a thorough tour of inspection.    The balloon itself is of the ordinary type with square basket suspended.   An officer and a sergeant make the observations.   Today it was 2,200 feet up, exerting an upwards pressure of 5 cmts.   The most interesting part of the plant is the winding machinery below, which is mounted on a motor lorry and driven by a petrol motor specially designed for the purpose.   A number of ropes hang from the sides of the balloon &amp; when it descends the Tommies catch these &amp; take their huge captive into a nest behind the trees.   A Vickers' machine gun, mounted on a tall tripod is always kept in readiness below in case of aeroplane attach.   Fritz was shelling one of these balloons very</p>
