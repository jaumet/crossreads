I received another note from Mrs. H. today telling me that they were waiting and expecting to hear any day now that I was coming up. I had a letter from Jack Howell a few days ago. I received one from Aunt Nellie telling me what he was in and that he expected to go to Salisbury, had I known before I would have been able to see him as he was at Bovington while I was there, but we did not meet I have been wondering if Harry is on this side of the Universe and intend Posting a note to him Care of Head Quarters. It may find him. Today we went out on a Route march out towards Bere Regis, you will Possibly be able to find it on the map near Wareham, it is just an Inn the "Angel" and a few Thatched Roofed Homes clustered round. then this afternoon the decision of the Court was declared in the usual manner. one of the L.H. sergeants was sent up for a Field Gen. Court Mart and Reduced to the Ranks. it seems that for some Reason or other he broke a few window Panes at Bovington.
