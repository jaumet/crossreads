 1916   WEDNESDAY 28   JUNE 
 Another rainy day. It cleared up a bit in evening. We saw the most gorgeous sunset I ever saw. I have see grander ones but never one with so many colours before. We had the King's regulations relating to punishments on active service read to us by Capt Campbel in the morning and no parade in afternoon. The whole convoy running up together in evening & they say we get to Dakka in morning & we may be staying till Sunday.
