<p>charge has been recommended for a decoration,  there were 3 big parties all told &amp; they were all dished up, a rather fine performance,  another fine performance was put up a few nights ago by a 5th Battn chap   it appears that a big German patrol captured him &amp; the officer in charge of them held a pistol to his head &amp; threatened to blow his brains out if he did not lead them to our next post, the chap did as he was told &amp; when they got about 10 yards off the post our sentries halted them and sang out who are you   what did the Australian do but throw himself flat on the ground &amp; yelled out Germans",  at this the whole post</p>
