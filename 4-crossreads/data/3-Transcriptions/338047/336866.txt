I was very weak and was not doing too well. However at Rambures we got a lift in a lorry and rode the rest of the way to Abbeville. We alighted in the town and made for the train, just arriving in time. The train was already in the station. The leave train was rather superior to the ordinary troop train, being provided with seats around the trucks (covered) and a stove in the centre. After a slow journey we arrived at Boulougne about 5pm. we made tracks for the rest billet, which was situated fairly close to the wharves, and dumped our equipment and rifles on our bunks for the night. The rest billet was a warehouse, and we were on the the third floor. The floor was covered with tiers of bunks</p>
