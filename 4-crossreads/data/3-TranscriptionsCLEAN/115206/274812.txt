August,1918Friday 30
Bourcy . Bty. Position.Weather cool and wet during early morning. We climbed out at 2.10am and pulled out at 2.20pm.After 21/2 hours on road, we came into position on the slope of a hill behind the above village. We are now back on the Somme battlefield of 1916 again and I can quite believe the stories of the mud that reigned supreme during that winter. Smithy and I wired the O.P. 31/2 miles kilos, and I reeled the best part up after shooting had finished. Saw our chaps though telescopes walking on the other bank of the canal .Wrote to Ken Gunn.
