No 9   9th Feb. 1916My Dear Mother = Since I wrote to you I have not been able to see much of the country round here,  on Saturday last a couple of my mates & I went out to the Zoo, we did not have much time, so could not see everything, but we found the Kangaroos that the 3rd Light Horse brought out with them,   They look quite at home in their little enclosure,   There are a few Australian Birds in the collection and they have unpronounceable names.   The Lions are fine, one old Lioness, was busy with a piece of meat and her three cubs, were prowling round the cage.   The Zoo is out towards the Pyramids from Cairo, about 30 minutes ride in the train for which you pay 1/2 Piastre.   On Sunday we went out to the Pyramids.  Saw the Sphynx & also the Temple of the Sphynx.   We did not have time to climb the Pyramid of Cheops, or go inside,   The guide wanted 3/- to take us round but we refused to have anything to do with him, so at least he came down.   The next man wanted nearly as much to take us inside the Pyramid, so we did not bother trying to beat him down, when the first Brigade came over here and found that every thing was cheap they just spent their money for spending sake, and now things that were sold for a few Milliemmes cost as many Piastres for the Natives were not slow to see that the Australians did not know the value of his money in Egypt, and up went the prices I thought
