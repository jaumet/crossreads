<p>a charge to drive enemy back. Capt Lewis got shot in the chest just as I felt a flank fire &amp; called a warning to him. The bullets &amp; sand flew &amp; we did some firing. I used the periscope a good deal &amp; watched the shots our chaps made at times. The big gun got a couple more shots into the valley about 3 pm &amp; also one or two on or near our trenches. She was supposed to have been silenced too.</p>
<p>Our chaps behaved jolly well I think &amp; there were no signs</p>
