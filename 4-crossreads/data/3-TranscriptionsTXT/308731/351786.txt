 Dear Old Dad, 
 Mum is just washing up the tea things for we have just had tea.  We rode Jolly a lot to-day so I think he ought to have a rest now, don't you.  I think I told you that Nancy had 4 kittens and Ginger had two that makes 6 well one day Gingers Black and White one got lost in two or Three days we found it under all the dirty clothes it is still alive.  we drowned Nancy's 4 kittens and kept Ginger's Grey one and 1 Black and White.  There are some little Grape's but not ripe yet, and If you hurry up and come home to have some?  They will not be ripe till abut next March in 1919.  I think I will be drawing for you Frank is.  If I have to draw on another paper I think we will have two letters.
