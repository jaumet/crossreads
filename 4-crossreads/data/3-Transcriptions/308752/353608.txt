<p>Part XIII 4th. September, 1918, to 11th. November, 1918<br/>In the line:  Bullicourt Stunt:  Rest at Biencourt Chateau: Armistice signed.</p>
<p>The 13th Part of Diary<br/>From the 4th September to the 11th November 1918.<br/>L.W. Colley-Priest</p>
<p>Thirteen is supposed to be an unlucky number, but this Edition proves quite the opposite, as it contains news of victory after victory of the Allied Forces, until such times as we have forced Germany to acknowledge defeat. In the 11th report I stated that I had every hope for the future, &amp; surely my wishes were gratified, &amp; today all the Allied Nations of the World, are celebrating our overwhelming defeat of the German High Command, who tried to over run Europe. I am getting a little ahead of myself so will continue on from the 4th September,  the day after my return from Leave.</p>
<p>4th September 1918.  Received orders to be ready to proceed to the Line, &amp; at 1 p.m. I left the Unit Hd Qrtrs with a small party of twelve bearers, for the trenches.  You can bet that it was hard coming back to this right on top of Blighty Leave, after fourteen days of comfort &amp; cleanliness. Arrived at our destination at 5 p.m. which turned out to be a Loading Post.  Fortunately we did not have very much work to do, so obtained a fairly good sleep. Slept in a filthy German Dugout, what a contrast to last Wednesday night, where I was living in a fine hotel in Blackpool, &ndash; to night under the ground like a rabbit.</p>
