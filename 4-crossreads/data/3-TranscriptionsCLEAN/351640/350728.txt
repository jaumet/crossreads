  
 Your letters are here three days under the month or exactly 27 days from your writing, those from Doffie & Maggie were written on the 17th March which makes the delivery to me with the lapse of but twenty five days. 
 No date plums here, though they should flourish in this climate.  Must look for them.  Glad you like the stamps & newspaper cuttings.  Shall expect the photographs. 
 My regards to Mr Fitzgerald.  It is pleasing that he and Mr Titheradge were interested in my remarks about this part of the world. 
 Mr Travers is a thoughtful man.  I like him. 
 Kitty appears to be in demand with the fiddle.  Has she practised lately?  Clever girl. 
 What a giddy girl Maria is to desire to go to the pictures.  Cheered you both up no doubt. 
 Rain is always welcome in Sydney.  Here no one thinks of rain except as a phenomenon, as a matter of fact when a shower comes everyone fears to be wet, each wraps up in a most wonderful manner, for weeks after the falling water is a subject for general conversation.  It makes me laugh.  Holman's holidays save him, or rather have saved him much trouble, several times, but it is  likely  probable that he will overdo it, then there will be the long & expected disruption in the party; the result of which 'tis not easy to foresee. 
 Weston has not replied to my letter addressed to "The Orsova, Suez".  Sorry the idea did not occur to me, because a trip to the Canal could have been easily arranged.  Let us hope that the ship will dodge all the submarines between Port Said & London.  Should I get to London I hope to see Mary & Nellie Johnson. 
 Dick Arthurs suggestion to call on Barr Brown about the rooms was a good one. 
 My best wishes to the Bridges & Macdonalds.
