 Third Australian Division Divisional Headquarters Larkhill Camp, Salisbury Plain 
 10th October 1916

 My dear Colonel 
 I am returning herewith Senator Pearce's letter, as I am unfortunately not able to help in this matter. Let me explain. The 3rd Divisional Cyclist Company never joined up with the Division; they have done away with the Cyclists as a Divisional unit. I am not at all sure whether this Company has been retained as Cyclists at all, &amp; am under the impression that the whole of the personnel has been converted into infantry, &amp; it is quite possible that some, if not many, of the Company have proceeded to France as drafts. However, I do not know this for certain, nor do I know the present or former whereabouts of the Cyclist Company. Possibly the authorities at Tidworth could tell you. 
 I am sending the Minister's letter back to you instead of direct to Tidworth, so that you might know what the situation was. 
 Incidentally, Judge Ferguson wrote to me, not about his own son, but about another very well qualified man who belonged to the same unit, &amp; who has come to me some weeks ago &amp; is employed in a legal capacity, he being a prominent barrister in New South Wales. 
 Yours faithfully 
 John Monash 
 To B. General Sir Newton Moore Can you suggest anything in this matter? R. McC. A. 11. X. 16.
