  
 I saw a similar one at Suva & on a smaller scale at Lake Eacham in N Q-land - The S. American Caesalpuna pulcherrima was a mass of yellow & red flame -  That & the Poinciana regia stand out easily first for color effect - All vegetation is lush & luxuriant - Breadfruit trees to Coco palms & giant Pandani & Rubber trees & chocolate trees & Castor oil Shrubs - I gathered some ferns but time is necessary for collecting & one cant spare much - It was a very fine walk indeed - the best I've had so far - Inboard by 6.45 & dinner Lambton was a guest - He returns to Sydney in 3 weeks he says - Wants to run a Naval Brigade to Europe - I've asked him to take me as medico - Probably that idea has been mooted & is turned down by the powers that be - Beer flowed rather freely till 10 pm - Bridge & Gramophone & talk & dancing - all at the same time - No wonder at times you forget you held the 13th card or mused as to what trumps were & what the devil your partner was doing - Life after dinner flows very merrily in a naval mess - Bed - 10.30. very much rain I alone slept top side -
