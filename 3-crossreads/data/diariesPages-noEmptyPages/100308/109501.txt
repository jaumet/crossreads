3/5/17   L?Homme Mort
10 pm the English officers love to congregate and drink whisky and tonight a most elaborate dinner was served up port, other wine etc etc. This on a bloody battlefield Our heavy shelling and barrages is all going on top of our wounded lying out there. Brutal game this and so useless.
10.30 pm 22nd Brigade (English) attacked Bullecourt under a heavy barrage which lit up the whole place very vividly. Flares were very numerous from the Boche but there were not many calls for artillery support. In front of the Australians the flares were noticeably further back than they were in front of the British which would show how much further we had pushed ahead there
11.30 Cannonade ceased and there was an almost uncanny silence after all the noise of the last 18 hours. The burst of bomb, rifle cracks, and the rattle of m.g. fire came very distinctly to ear and was sign of heavy battling hand to hand. Reports came back that they had gone right ahead and captured their objectives.
