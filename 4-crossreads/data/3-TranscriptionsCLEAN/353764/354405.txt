  
 my moustache off & have now got sore lips for my trouble.  Such is life. I saw an Argus to day dated 4/1/16 & was very interested in it, as this is the latest dated paper I have seen. Am feeling pretty tired on it & am turning in very early. Lots of troops going out presumably to the Persian Gulf.  I was working in the Butts to-day & the way the Bullets zip through makes one think of what it would be like under actual fire. I note by the Argus that L Blomfield is sick in Hospital. Very windy & cold to-night. 
 15.2.16 Tuesday Had a very exciting night of it to-night viz - I met the old & original Jack Rolfe.  He told me many funny things & is still as talkative as ever.  He also has a Moustache & looks for all the world like a Spanish Brigand. He told me that all were well when he left home & I am very thankful.  We had a great talk of olden times & are going to continue it to-morrow night. Raining all day & pretty cold.
