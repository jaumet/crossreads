1917 Tuesday 8 May
Morning duties. Afternoon off Tog up go into Boulogne. Plenty to interest one round the docks, troops arriving hospital ships leaving for Blighty, submarines, destroyer escorts ? a busy everchanging scene. Boulogne is the main artery connecting France England. 
Jock Heylin joins me later we go to French Cinema at the "Theatre Municiple" a pretty little theatre it proved to be. Spent an enjoyable 2 hours there then home in time to sign off at 9 p.m.
