  
 morning, Dene actually getting up to let him have some breakfast & see him off. 
 Everyone asks about you & sends all kinds of messages for good luck & Mrs. Lovegrove is knitting you a pair of sox. Didn't you take any pyjamas? I found the ones I bought for you in your room. 
 Well my dear old boy I must stop this isn't a very lively letter but I have been so closed up in the house with Hazel in bed that I'm dull. The barracks people told me to address you Egypt & that your letters would be forwarded as very likely you were going on to England. 
 War news is still very dreadful, though slightly in our favour & the Turks seem to be in for a father of a beating. Uncle Jim thinks you may go there to fight first & he says it will be a softer thing than in Belgium. 
 Adieu dear we all miss you very much & wish you were safely home again. 
 With much love from X Mother X 
 My love to Eric & kindest remembrances to Mr. Thompson.
