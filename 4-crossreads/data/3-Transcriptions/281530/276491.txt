<p>19/6/18<br/>This morning's visit to C &amp; D Coys was very necessary and I found considerable slackness. Ordered 1 hour extra parade for the latter. Close order drill etc &ndash; very necessary as the men are slack &amp; careless. Rain blew up but did not properly come down until noon when such a deluge set in that all ideas of sport this afternoon had to be cancelled. Spent the afternoon writing. 7 men evacuated today with "P.W.O" a form of "la grippe" which I also have. Smith the L.G.O. is confined to his bed with it. Leon Barbier came in and yarned for quite a long while and remained to dinner. Our Band played very well. A sunshiny shower &ndash; silver rain falling on green grass among these fine old trees was very beautiful tonight. Colonel Brazenor came in for a couple of hours at the end of which we were amused to find that War was the only topic</p>
