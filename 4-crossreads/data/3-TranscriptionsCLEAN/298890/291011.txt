  
 11. Thursday. Rained heavily nearly all day. Typed "On a Street" [?]. Fred P. rang up at 6 & came out to supper with me & stayed till nearly 12. Had a fire - such a luxury. xxxxx 
 12. Friday. Heavy showers again. Typed again. Depressed & miserable. 
 13. Saturday. Fine in morning but heavy showers again.  Miss Ince took me to a dancing exhibition at Albert Hall in afternoon. Typed again - making my shoulder very tired.
