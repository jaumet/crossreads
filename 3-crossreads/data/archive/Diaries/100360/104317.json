While waiting for the Train I met Wally Hind, who was also going on Leave to Blighty.  He has 2 pips up now, &amp; is o/c Trench Mortar Batteries.  We left Bapaume about 3.30 in cattle trucks.  It was a great trip, everybody was in such high spirits.  We changed Trains at Candas, where the French take over the railway from the British.  Arrived  Boulogne about 11.30 Sunday morning.

Arrived in Folkestone a bit after 6.  It was just glorious being in England again after having been away so many years.  People evidently knew ours was the Leave Train, as all along the route to London they waved their hand Kefs.  Arrived in London about 9.
