After altering our courses the stranger was now nearly astern & gaining on us. darkness came & he was about 4 miles off. We increased our speed & called the firemen who were off duty & put a double lot at the furnesses. Our speed in a matter of 15 minutes increased to 17 Knots & then to 18 Knots about 20 miles an hour. Revolutions on both engins 92. The troopship vibrating & going for all she was worth. We soon lost sight of him & continued at that speed during the night. All troops on deck with probably 500 glasses straining there eyes to see if they could see anything.After at daybreak not a thing visable. We sent a wireless out & sent word of this stranger's movements. We found out after as we had suspected that she was a raider. She was sighted & sunk by gunfire by one of the English auxilary cruisers. We all thanked God for the speed we had otherwise we would have been a easy prey for him. We proved the above statement re the raider from the Naval Authorities at Port Said.Nothing of importance happened until we got of the Island of Perim . We were chalanged by a British Patrol cruiser Sent an officer on board satisfied we were all right & steamed again up the Red Sea towards Suez. We had a splendid trip up the Red Sea
