&pieces of shell fell all around us but no one was hit, but 4 horses bolted out of the A.S.C. lines & could not be found this morningYou should have heard the French people when the shells & bombs were flying, they were terribly excited & started running about & looking for shelter, some of the boys quietened them a bit, they were saying "Allemand us bon, "Allemand bombard", some of our planes went up after them, & with the aid of the guns accounted for 2 of them.Got orders last night to pack up & be ready to move off at 9 next morning I was Orderly Corporal this morning so I had my work cut out to get my work finished & pack up in time.At 9.30 off we went our Coy leading & all as merry as crickets
