  
 9/10/17 Broodseinde news except what could be gleaned from Braithwaite over the telephone. The sound of rifle and shell fire was great and dirty work was in progress. We saw 3 coys. forming up for counter attack and put the artillery on to them. On the left the 5th. Bde did alright but we are well goosed. A just reward for trying to do things with poor exhausted chaps. Sent frequent reports to Bde.H.Q. and had good liaiason with all other units. Not very many wounded came past us but many and prisoners went down the road bound for the rear. Towards evening another hate was on. Just at dark I had word from Braithwaite but none at all of Bunning although we received a report of his place being taken by Fritz. The S.O.S went up from it at 5.38 and after that there was silence. We gave Bunning up for lost entirely. An hour after some wounded came in from Anderson's party. They had a rough time all mud covered.
