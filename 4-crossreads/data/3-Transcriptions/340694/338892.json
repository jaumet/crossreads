<p>7<br/>the dust would nearly choke you. Last night Horace &amp; I went down to the Canal for a yarn it was fine in the moonlight. When I arrived back there was a letter from Ruth dated 31/3/16 &amp; a parcel from Hilda Rees containing medical comforts. Have written my thanks to-day.</p>
<p>Had a lovely swim this afternoon about 4 o'c. While we were there the "Ceramic" came along packed with Troops among them was the 36th Battn.

<p>It's been an awful day but nice &amp; cool to-night. Had a yarn with Eric &amp; the lads</p>
