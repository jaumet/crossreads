<p>Jan 6th<br/>Have been down with an attack of trench fever and feel dopey.  I was strangely exhilarated up to a certain point, and just amused at things.<br/>For instance some of the boys had brought sandbags in which to hang their rations from the roof of the pill box to dodge the rats &amp; mice; and, waking up while the others were <strike>quite</strike> fast asleep, I roared with laughter to see these hanging bags just swarming with mice, while my own stuff, near my head, was unattacked. Throughout the night my high spirits prevailed; but when the relief came, &amp; we had to move back, my energy seemed to go suddenly, it was a misery to lift my pack to my shoulders, &amp; my legs became quite weak.  I could do no more than crawl, and dropped right out of the rush back, which it appears is always a rather helter skelter proceeding.  Men passed me, saying "Shake it up, Mercer; youre liable to catch machine gun fire, here"; and I didn't care -  I hardly knew where I was, and didn't care much for that either, nor for the machine guns when they started.  The feeling struck me that if I was hit it would save me a lot of trouble. By the time I got back to the old dugout in the Ravine, it seemed that I had been toiling back for hours; and I had a vague remembrance of losing my waterproof, which caught on a post &amp; was pulled out of the straps on my pack; and of being passed by an officer who urged me to get off the duck boards quickly.  The next I knew was that Wells, our O.C. was saying "Come on Mercer; it's stand to!"  In the trench, which is just above the Ravine, I imagined I was in a produce store, the sandbags, somehow, seeing piles of pumpkins. &amp; the machine gun absurdly appearing to me as a parrot!  Don't remember</p>
