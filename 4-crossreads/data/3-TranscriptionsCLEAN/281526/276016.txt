20/12/17 Kortepypsupplied some buckets of hot water and the tub was placed on the floor of her bedroom. For 1 franc it was possible to get wet all over. It was desperately cold coming out. One platoon was on the rifle range this afternoon and the balance were on drill. At 5 o'c HJWiltshire came down from the 21st and then Jack (now a first Lieut.) came in and we had a yarn. Jack stayed to mess after which Lanyon lectured on Cooperation with Artillery. Main reported and I told him exactly what the position was as regards himself. After mess spent the evening with Jack talking in our little centre room which is very cosy. Some absentees are doing odd robberies round here, some are said to have murdered a boy at Nieppe & one of the 24th. was pinched for sand bagging. It is a strange war. Every indication of another freeze.
