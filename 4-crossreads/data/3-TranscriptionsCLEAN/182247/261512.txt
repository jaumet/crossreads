Anzac Day.  A sort of half hearted holiday, only that one had to do as one was told xxxx regarding to the place where one wished to spend it.  It was observed by a sports programme held in the Bull Ring and which was widely attended and enjoyed.  They reminded one of what the old Olympian Games must have been, for there was many a combat fought on that ground on this Anzac Day between sturdy and stalwart sons of the Empire's far flung colonies and those sons who live nearer the hearth of home.  Many of these called for Herculean strength and determination, such a splendid and vast assemblage of physical force and talent was there arrayed.  I suppose a finer set of athletic humanity was never assembled before, for this drafting camp at Etaples was the main stream which had to and did feed the British Front in France and Flanders, making up their deficiencies in men and materials a few hours after they were ascertained.  Truly a wonderfully organised place with its training grounds, Tommy-Sergeants Major, and Hospitals, but a horrid place to be at for the eight or nine days prior to one's introduction to warfare, as we now know it.

Left Etaples with reinforcements for 15th Field Company of Australian Engineers, somewhere in France.  Caught train at Etaples, after having been served with rations in plenty, and set out along our journey, we knew not whither.  We might have been going to Berlin, for all we knew.  We were stuffed into horse carriages, which were branded "eight horses or 40 men."  We did not care as there were plenty of sights to witness as we made our way across the map of France, and the door openings in the horse boxes were much more preferable to the dingy little window openings in the French carriages, as we knew them.  We arrived at Albert at 3 and went into the Anzac Drafting Camp for the night.  After cleaning up a bit, we got our orders and returned to Albert to see if there was such a thing as a restaurant among its pitiable ruins.  It seemed to us to be a mere heap of bricks and told us in advance of what we could expect in the zones more adjacent to the firing line.  We spent an hour or so having a look round the town, at the shattered shops, Church with the famous leaning virgin on its shattered tower, of which the French inhabitants held the belief that the day upon which this statue fell the war would cease.  We got tired after a while, and after unloading our rations waggon, supplying our own needs in plenty, not only immdeiate but well into the future, we turned in for the night, as we knew that we had a hard day's marching before us in the morning.
