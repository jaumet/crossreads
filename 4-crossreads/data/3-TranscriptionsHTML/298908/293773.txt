<p>Have been very busy this evening washing my pants &amp; puttees for my leave came through unexpectedly this afternoon.<br/>Had our first frost of the season this morning but it was very light the nights are getting mighty chilly now &amp; one needs a lot of blankets.</p>
<p>2nd.  Have had very large dental parades today but I can manage them quite easily now.<br/>This evening after tea Charlie Tonkin called round to see me &amp; we went over to the "pictures" at the O.T.B. there I heard that Turkey had skied the towel, I daresay its true for she can't hang out very long on her own, the news seems to get better every day now if that can possibly be, no one seems to know where old Foch is going to hit them next, he is a silent customer if ever there was one &amp; his name is idolized among the soldiers &amp; people over here, heavens</p>
