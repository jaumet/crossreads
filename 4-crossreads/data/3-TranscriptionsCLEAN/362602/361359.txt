Fremantle is a quiet clean little place just like Burwood, but the suburbs in between it & Perth, 12 miles away, are not nearly so big as our suburbs.  We met three of the nurses this morning & went for a walk down by the "Swanee River".  It is lovely down there.  All sorts of motor-boats & sailing craft & a large swimming baths & there is a football ground, cricket grounds & lawn tennis greens along the banks.  The steamer runs down to Fremantle but we have to take the train it is so much quicker.  I have only seen two of "the cloth" both Priests & one travelled in our car last night.  The train was packed & the climate here at present is very like Sydney in February.
