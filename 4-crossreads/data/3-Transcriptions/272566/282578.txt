<p>Sunday 13 May</p>
<p>Warm again today.  All stretcher-bearers left for the line this morning.  Every available man was sent, but I have been left behind as a Despatch Rider on the Douglas Bike.  Up to the present I have not missed one carry in the line &amp; have been out every time.  Having done as much as anyone in the unit and considering that very few of the original 8th are here now I think its my turn for a sweet job.  Whether it will be permanent or not its hard to say, but each Amb. is supposed to have 2 Despatch Riders.  All runs today were successful.  Shelling of the roads was heavy.  Fritz observation Balloon brought down.<br/>Heavy thunderstorm broke out just before midnight.</p>
