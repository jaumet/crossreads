He said it was much better for her to be out there. He seemed very happy to be with me a bit. He may get a job in Cairo at Head Quarters while waiting  for  to be sent off to some point of the war zone. He looks well - a very nice boy. I enclose his note to me. He sent me a postcard photograph of himself. I wrote to Mrs Rich about having seen him - to Australia - but since I posted the letter I got yours saying she was leaving via America. Alma Dowe says she knows the place well where Bill has got a job, and says the country is lovely and the community there quite an interesting study - so I hope Bill will find some interest - perhaps fishing will be good. It is a place I often wished to visit myself would like to go along the Baranjack river with you and Father when I come home. Willie Owen described me a lovely peaceful holiday he had there fishing - I was amused to hear about B. Nottingham. I hope she wont worry Dad -
