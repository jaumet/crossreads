<p>24 Sept, 1916<br/>Fancy having a day of rest on Sunday.  Yesterday we came out to the front line &amp; put in most of the day on observation, last night seven of us took up a post on the old desert</p>
<p>The stars above shed forth their soft quiet light,<br/>From out the velvet black ness of the sky<br/>And like some evil phantoms of the night<br/>Thin misty clouds go floating by.</p>
<p>Beneath, the desert spreads its silent sands,<br/>Along lone ridges steals the ghostly mist,<br/>A spirit grey lies brooding oer the land,<br/>The night, all ears is gently crying, Hist!</p>
<p>There was no watch in the crowd so the shifts were a matter of guess work but every one seemed satisfied this morning.  We had breakfast at this hod where there is a good well, what a treat to have a good wash &amp; to lie down with a prospect of not being disturbed.</p>
