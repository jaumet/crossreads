<p>Thursday, 22 October, 1914<br/>After stables I felt pretty badly so reported sick and was exempted from duty.</p>
<p>I spent the day lying in the sun &amp; late in the afternoon went below &amp; fell asleep.</p>
<p>The doctor came down &amp; on taking my temp, which was over 100, ordered me into the hospital.</p>
<p>I was the first to go into the hos. so christened it.  I received every attention there and the bunks were much appreciated after the hammocks.</p>
<p>Commenced to rain.</p>
<p>Friday, 23 October, 1914<br/>I awoke feeling better &amp; spent the day writing to my mother &amp; Edith.</p>
<p>The Col &amp; Dr came down to see me, I think they dreaded I was a measel contact.</p>
<p>I read a few magazines until I fell asleep &amp; the Dr awoke me, and on enquiry as to health told me I could get up next day.</p>
<p>Rained all day &amp; previous night.</p>
