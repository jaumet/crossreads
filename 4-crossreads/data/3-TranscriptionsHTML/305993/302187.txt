<p>&amp; by the prices seen at the various shops this sum would not go far towards living.  At 3 p.m. we embarked 100 civilian passengers, mostly French &amp; a few French detail troops for Egypt.  At 4 p.m. we left the Quay for sea bound for Port Said.  Fine weather prevails.  The Canberra left yesterday with a few civilian passengers for Egypt.  We heard a rumour at Marseilles that we may go back to Australia in the course of a few months.  But we have heard it so often now that we can hardly believe the fact when it is announced officially.</p>
<p>6.4.19<br/>Fine weather prevails.  Wireless messages re mines floating adrift on our track, this is practically the same warnings every trip &amp; are very dangerous, yet good luck goes farther than good management in this respect as they are not visible at night &amp; practically not visible during the day until within a very dangerous area.</p>
<p>7.4.19<br/>Our French passengers are 13 Saloon &amp; 1 British Major General &amp; 97 French 2nd Class Civilian passengers.  Splendid weather prevails now in the Mediterean as the winter is over &amp; spring well in.</p>
<p>7.3 [4].19<br/>Fine weather prevails &amp; all passengers doing well, a concert was held at the 2nd Class tonight in which all the civilian passengers attended.  The French Baroness on board presided.  She is the wife of the French Embasador at Egypt.  We had also a Major General, one of the War's heroes going to Egypt.</p>
