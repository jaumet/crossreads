a cross between a turtle & a caterpiller is the best description of it: plenty of shells kicking about:
Wednesday Nov 8th  Trenches: showery day: plenty of shells: we give him a rough time alright: our feet are very wet & swollen: we had a rough time with the cases after tea: Poor old Tom was sniped & then killed by a shell: he was a good mate & I am indeed sorry for his wife & children:
Thursday Nov 9th  Trenches: fairly clear day: we took the opportunity of taking our boots off & our feet swelled a lot: we had to take some of the boys down with their feet: the tank is a funny sight & I had a good look as I passed only a few yards off it: there are plenty of dead laying about: death finds men in funny attitudes one here is sitting in the trench with a bible where he has been reading: 'planes were about galore & & some great duals took places as many as twenty being engaged at once: we seen a few come down: relieved about 10PM by the 19th : it was a rough time & where we jumped in was where most stopped till relieved: I guided No 7 over to Bgde H.Q. & we got a few shells as I got back & patched them up: took some cases round to the dressing station & then straggled home tired, weary,& full up of everything concerning war: the rum kept us going alright in the trenches: taubes about at night again:
Friday Nov 10th  Carlton camp: got a feed & turned in: we are in tents: fair day: up at noon: plenty of 'planes about & seen some good duals: a few taubes came down: Fritz sent a few shells over: there were a few 'planes about again after tea: they were bomb dropping a few nights ago: the night was as bright as day: I am badly knocked up & have a bad cold too:
