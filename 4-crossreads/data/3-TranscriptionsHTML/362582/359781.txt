<p>I have just received the parcel you sent me, and think Alice is very clever, the garments are made beautifully. The stockings are very useful indeed. I am wearing my cashmere ones now. I've also begun to wear my warm nighties, so am wearing the pretty one you sent to me by Consie Murray. Dorothy &amp; I have had a grand trip to-day. Drove to Ostrich Farm, then to Obelisk, the Virgins well &amp; Tree, Matarich &ndash; then to Koubbeh Gardens for afternoon tea. It is a beautiful drive &amp; the day was perfect. Got home in time for 7. P.m. dinner, so getting some of our letters written. Think it best to write when we can, because our letters are censored now, so do not worry if my letters are not so regular. Cannot always tell when the mail leaves for Australia. Little Eddy must be getting a big boy now. Suppose the darling will have forgotten my by the time I return. He is progressing</p>
