<p>Breakfast. Mutton &amp; tea &amp; bread (usually) extremely useful for killing porpoises, <br/>Dinner Mutton &amp; bread (but no tea) <br/>Supper Mutton &amp; tea &amp; bread.</p>
<p>The monotony of the course was somewhat relieved by plum duff (just as weighty as the before mentioned bread) for dinner &amp; tinned herring for tea.<br/>The monotony of the daily routine was also relieved by the news that a sailor lost &pound;10 at "banker",&amp; that an individual (whether sailor or soldier we do not know) was captured as a spy just as he threw the sights of one of our 4.7s over board. He was removed to the "Sydney" where in all probability he will be shot. Lucky dog!</p>
