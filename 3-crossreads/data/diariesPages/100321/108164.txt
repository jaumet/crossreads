1/2/19 Gourdinne
The General made a speech extolling Brown and we drank several rounds of Benedictine ? now a rather rare commodity. Fierce arguments raged about the Transcontinental and other home railways and re the break of guage. I worded the G. round to my way of thinking on the question of the 23rd. transfer. A 24th boy came in with his head bandaged up due to being sandbagged he said. McColl had a car and ran me home in it ? a swift run along frozen hard roads. Snow deep on the ploughed fields on either side of the track and upon all the house tops. Turned in at once all the family being well and truly in bed. A cold frosty night.
