  
 Monday 24 December1917 Busy for Xmas day - "Connaught" scheme is red shades, plants & flowers, very effective though & strangely enough, the pts. in their blue suits & the white ward & quilts carry out the "Red, White & Blue" well.  Off duty 2-5, town & shopped, without doing much, then duty & shook hands with L.  Allenby  Wingate & rec'd gracious word & a card from them both.  C.G. very nice & very scotch. I find only 12 men to cook for 1500 pts. C of E Padre is coldly friendly like the rest. Absence of home & love & weighing very heavily these days.
