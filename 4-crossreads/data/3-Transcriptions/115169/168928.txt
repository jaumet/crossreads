<p>terrible hard luck we were unable to trap these Hun raiders in our meshes, and how they managed to escape was a miracle.  That the action was fought in great hurry is without doubt, as the enemy was anxious to make good their escape before our forces could intercept them - consequently no effort was made by the Hun to recue any of the crew of the sunken destroyers, - they even left the merchantmen whilst still sinking, and which allowed the British patrol craft, which arrived shortly afterwards, to rescue some thirty or so Norwegians, and others.<br/>Thus the Germans had once again disregarded the historic chivalry of the seas &ndash; Unfortunately the loss of life to the British Navy was 135 officers and men &ndash; The enemy raiders are said to have evaded our watching squadrons, during the long dark nights, both during the outward and homeward dash.<br/>Oct 20th  at 6 P.M. "Southampton" and "Birmingham" proceeded to sea.</p>
