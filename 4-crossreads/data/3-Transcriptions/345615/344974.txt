<p><strike>Unit</strike> Regt which will possibly be coming to take their place</p>
<p>It hurt to see my Company <strike>be lef</strike> move off &amp; be left behind in Camp, their is nothing finer than the joy of being on the trek however hard it is. And I had the 'pip' all morning.</p>
<p>I put in a written application to the O.C. asking to be allowed to rejoin my company for ordinary duty but so far have had no reply.</p>
<p>Jack Stanton the L.H. Postal orderly also was 'fed up' as we have had nothing to do all day, so this afternoon we went up to the L.H Lines &amp; borrowed a couple of horses &amp; have been for a good ride &amp; gallop round the Camp and on the beach</p>
