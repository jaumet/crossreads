<p>17th January 1917.<br/>Revielle 5-3- a.m. &amp; a bitterly cold morning I can assure you. It was still snowing heavily. At 9.30 a.m. we started on a 7 mile march to ------  Wood, where our headquarters was the last time we were in the Trenches. Arrived at our destination at 2. p.m. fortunately this time we are to live in huts which were very cosy &amp; warm. The mud was frightful far worse than what it was before. In the Transport lines I noticed a horse standing in the mud, the poor brute could not move, only its head &amp; back could be seen, the top of the wagon was just distinguishable.  Judging by this you can just imagine what a terrible state this country is in. Continually working<br/>in the mud is very disheartening. The three Ambulances are working together as usual.</p>
<p>18th January 1917.<br/>Plenty of work again at the Rest Station. I believe each Ambulance will work seven days in the Line, rather too long I think in this climate. This means that our Bearers will do seven days fatigues at the Dressing Station before our turn comes round for Stretcher Bearing again. The weather during these seven days was very cold, almost unbearable.</p>
