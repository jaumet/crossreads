<p>poor Bill Carey had been killed he used to belong to our old Company H, &amp; the night of the charge at Pozeries, he left the Pioneer Battalion, &amp; joined in the charge with us, the day after we went out he was skittled.</p>
<p>This afternoon we were out on a route march with full packs up it is punishment for the number of drunks that have been about &amp; to punish the few, they punish the whole lot; thats a bad point I reckon in the military, to make the many suffer for the few but they did not take us far, &amp; we marched without Tunics, so we were not so badly off</p>
