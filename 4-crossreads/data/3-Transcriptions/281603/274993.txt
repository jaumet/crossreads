<p>October &amp; November 1916</p>
<p>Friecourt.  Next morning we were on the move again &amp; went as far as the hill to the right of Marmetz Wood were we stayed in canvas huts for a couple of days &amp; while there met a lot of boys from the old town &amp; district.  While there we had our packs &amp; felt hats taken from us &amp; was issued with extra ammunition &amp; two bombs &amp; two sandbags each.  When we moved off on the 29th we were ready equiped for the firing line but only went to a trench between Delville &amp; Irones Woods &amp; there were no dug outs &amp; had to set to &amp; make ourselves shelter.  The   <strike>following</strike> following night it rained &amp; came through our roof &amp; we passed a miserable night but next morning set too &amp; made our dug out rain proof &amp; dried it.  While here I saw a 15in Howitzer in action which fired a shell 4 ft 6 ins long 14 cwt &amp; cost &pound;450 &amp; it was a great sight to see.  On the afternoon of the 1st of November we moved to a reserve trench a little to the west of the village of Flers &amp; two companies went into the firing line &amp; support trench. Next day the 2nd accompied with a couple of N.C.Os I went to supports to have a look round &amp; while on the way saw several of our famous tanks which had been put out of action</p>
