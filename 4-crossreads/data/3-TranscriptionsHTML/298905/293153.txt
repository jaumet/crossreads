<p>Last night a raiding party of Germans broke into the 11th Battalion trenche's but never a one got back again, they bayoneted 32 of them including a Prussian Guard officer they had no fewer that 28 bayonet holes in him<br/>According to report these aerial torpedoes are pretty crook things, they reckon they caused nearly all the casualties the other night, one of them lobbed right among a squad of Lewis gunners &amp; blew the lot of them (7) to atoms. I saw a great aerial fight to-day between a Taube &amp; one of our machines I don't know how it finished up but the Taube had the worst of it &amp; was being forced down when I saw them last<br/>There was a great string of barges towed down the canal past Sailly to-day there were about 20 of them</p>
