This village is entirely Christian, and in normal times, has a population of about 5000.  These figures, I expect, would be a good deal depleted during the war, especially as the inhabitants are Christian.  There is one thing specially noticeable which distinguishes the Mussulman from the Christian village.  The Christian place is at least fairly clean, with many decent buildings, while the entirely Mohammaden village of the same character is indescribably filthy and evil smelling.  This place on the south western side is honeycombed with stone walls, about 6 ft. in height, built of the rocks and stones cleared from the soil to allow cultivation.

Just as dawn was breaking, the guns spoke the big artillery broke out in earnest, and the machine guns kept up a ceaseless staccato.  8 A.M.  Word has just come through (not official) that the position has fallen and Johnny is once more on the move.  We were to go as far as Beiten last night but for some reason or other, did not do so Beiten lies just ahead of us.  We are camped on a rocky hillside, a little to the north east of Ram Allah.  We are surely winning the War.  This morning when Brigade orders came through there was an enquiry appended:  "On one of the G.S.
