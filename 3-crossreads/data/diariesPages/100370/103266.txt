are today back in the Jordan Valley once more.
On the 17th Aug. we left Wadi Hanien for Latroun, on the 18th left Latroun for Enab, at 3 P.M. on the 19th left Enab for Talaat Ed Dumm. Reached Jerusalem and camped for the night at about 6 P.M. Just got our saddles off, and billies on the boil, when the order came to saddle up, the Military Governor of Jerusalem would not allow us to camp there. After blessing him, we moved through Jerusalem to the Mount of Olives, reaching there about 8-30. Were on our way again at 3 A.M. the following morning and reached Talaat Ed Dumm at about 7-30 A.M. Stayed there till 4 A.M. on the morning of the 21st when we moved down into the Valley by the Wadi Quelt. Stayed there till 6 P.M. on the 22nd, then moved to our present Camp near to our old one in the Wadi. Everything is very quiet. No shelling so far, and it is rumoured we go back again on the 4th Sept. These interminable journeyings backward and forward!
1st Sept. The day of our rumoured departure is about the 7th or 8th of this month. I have never, even in our previous experiences here felt anything like the heat that we are enduring at present. Bivvies are no protection. By ten o'clock they are literally a furnace.
Friday 6th We moved last night, so once again rumour was proved to be the "lying jade" she has the reputation of being. We are camped now in a place in which I have never been before on the side of a hill within about a mile of the Mount of Temptation. There is a fine view. Sitting in my bivvy and looking out as I write these lines I can see a great expanse of the Dead Sea, its waters shimmering dully, through the dust haze which clouds the plain.
Down on the Flat and right in front of me lies Jericho, a patch of verdant green in the surrounding desolation. In the forefront of the town are a few gardens, watered by canals with water from the Wadi Quelt. Right in front, but a little to the right, lie the ruins of Ancient Jericho,
