 An Australasian JUNE arrived & no doubt letters are following. Am afraid many of mine were sunk in the MONGOLIA. On the Range again. I found a Reinforcement who had  never loaded or fired a Rifle yet . One of the men took a snapshot of me shooting in a GAS MASK, not easy as a mist covers the eye pieces from breathing. 
 No news yet re leave. None of the family ever complain about the increased cost of things or servants etc. I know your PENNIES can't go far these days & you are all doing your BIT.
