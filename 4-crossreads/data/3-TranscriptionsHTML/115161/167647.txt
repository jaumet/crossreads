<p>occupied about two nights ago.&nbsp; Here we receive our mail, mine including two parcels containing cake and other delicacies.&nbsp; They add to the weight I have to carry, but I have received letters from home and know all is well there, and I also know that we are out for a rest, and that every step I take carries me further from misery, so a little extra weight does not matter.</p>
