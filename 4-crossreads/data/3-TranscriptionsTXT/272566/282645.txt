 Monday 17 September 
 Moving Day. Trips to Arques, 8th Brigade Sigs. and A.D.M.S. at Blaringhem. At mid-day I set off following two motor ambulances.  We passed through Hazebrouck, St. Sylvestre, Eecke, Godewaerevelde and Boeschepe to Remy Siding just over the Belgian Border 2 Kilos from Poperinghe. 5 C.C.S's opposite us.  Met Bill Bailey &amp; Rupert Cooke First impressions of this camp give us the opinion that we are taking over a very comfortable home.
