  
 a fine town, but now awfully knocked about owing to continuous heavy bombardment.  Leaning steeple of church a great land mark.  Our Q.M. paid us a visit to take a list of shortages.  Losing a few of our old Officers. 
 Friday 10.11.16 Very heavy bombardment going on, on front where we have just come from.  On road repair work again.  Any amount of peace rumours flying about. 
 Saturday 11.11.16 Wrote home.  Still on roads.  Weather has been fine for the past couple of days.  Fritz unexpectedly shelled us here to-night, caused quite a stir among the majority in camp. 
 Sunday 12.11.16 Church parade at 10 AM.  Cleaned up
