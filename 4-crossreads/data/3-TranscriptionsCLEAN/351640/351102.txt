 My dear Girls:

 One of you letters that followed me to Lemnos has just come back,  it has date  The dates are 26 & 29 August 1915 
 Tabbie dear:/ Yes Macquarie St will be one worth showing to visitors when it is extended to the quay and the Western side well laid out and planted. Good Joey to be so hard working in the garden. Sweet girl to let Joey have share of your water bottle which warmed the sheets for your tootsies! You forgot to finish the letter. Weather too cold. Eh? 
 Joseph dear: Did the hot bottle warm your feet too dear? I hope so. The electric lamp advts. must add to the brightness of the city. Ramsay Smith & Barret will yet get even with the trippers who caused them so much trouble. The time is rapidly approaching for  their  justice to dealt out to the guilty creatures. Glad that you wrote to the Keohans. Good girl. I shall write to Mrs K. tonight. Thanks for the address.
