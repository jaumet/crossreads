<p>January 16<br/>104.<br/>Last night a raging tempest &ndash; wind and deep rain.  Today dull, but a day of magnificent rain cloud skies and massed colouring and all the land lovely in a wounderful light.  To Bailleul:  a fast walk there, and a drive back in one of H.Q. cars.</p>
<p>Paddy Burke tonight at mess passed along &ndash; and I read it while I ate sardines and bread &ndash; Frances Thompson's "Hound of Heaven".</p>
<p>January 17<br/>105.<br/>A wet drizzly day:  early light snow that melted at once on muddy ground.  Tonight to the Y.M. and heard a lecture &ndash; lantern &ndash; by Y.M. man by name of Brown, so, so, but interesting.  Sketched and posted to A.B. pencilling of the Huts on the Kruisstraat.</p>
<p>And so to bed.</p>
<p>January 18<br/>106.<br/>A day of greyness:  a day of early Spring coolness and colouring.</p>
<p>No mail.  Sketched a while.</p>
<p>January 20, 21<br/>107.<br/>Yesterday the Bearers down and a minor celebrating about Dan Mac's and Blue's bunk.</p>
<p>Mail:  letter of Oct. from Aunty Gertie, and from T.B.C. Grave's "Fairies and Fusiliers".</p>
<p>108.<br/>Paraded this morning to O.R.  Some note through from D.M.S., H.Q., of some private enquiring as to my health and condition.  Col. to fully report on it to D.M.S.  Another day of mild weather.  Brilliant sunrise and setting and superb skies of green-blue and grey.  Mail, letter from Mat. and from T.B.C., Poems 1908-14 by John Drinkwater.  Wrote to Mother, to Geoff, to Betty and to Bakers after report on books.</p>
<p>January 21<br/>109.<br/>At 2 a.m. the Colonel's hut burnt to the ground and everything in it compleately destroyed, about &pound;140 damages &ndash; a personal loss that is.  A fire burning in it ready against his turning in.  How does the H.Q. order affect a Col., the one making it a crime to leave a fire in any hutment or Billet without someone to watch it?  Mr. Poole's tent being burnt at Quehen, Col. announced it a gross carelessness!</p>
