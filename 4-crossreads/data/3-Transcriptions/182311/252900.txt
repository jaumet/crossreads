<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The physical fitness too, was something to marvel at and the morale too, never have I seen it better and only once as good, and that was before the Battle of Messines, for &quot;The Winter of our Discontent&quot; had passed and for a couple of weeks we had revelled in the kindly sunshine of springtime in France.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the &quot;Deluge&quot; - the Germans were at last making their much vaunted offensive and surely gaining ground, but it was not in the big plan to stop him yet, the Division was on the way there, there was no hurry, and then at the right moment we were embussed, quickly traversed 40 miles, debussed, marched five miles, deployed and quickly took up positions of vantage in open ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the 3 Australian Division<s>s</s> was back at the War, and then commenced the most eventful and the most interesting stage of the war, for, for some time, xxx we were able to wage war under conditions of open warfare, and the adaptability of our lads was wonderful, and the work done so really excellent that it has caused G.H.Q. to say of us that we are the best Division in France today.&nbsp; High praise I know, but with all modesty I can say that it is true; of course any Australian Division would have done this, but we were fortunately the first on the spot, and that too is part of the excellent work for our artillery worked by forced marches of some times thirty miles per day, went into action only a few hours after the infantry and moved up with us several thousand yards in the first night.</p>
