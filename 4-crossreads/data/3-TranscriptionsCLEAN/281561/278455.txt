  
 advantage of it; for an opportunity like this would bring me back from the grave. I will have a splendid holiday here. 15/2/18. Jack came down from London to see me yesterday. He is looking fit. Went to town with him today, had a most enjoyable time. He went back to London this afternoon. 23/2/18. Went for a run down into Devon during the week; was away two days but was not missed, it is lovely down there; well might they call it Glorious Devon! Had tea down town with Arch McKenzie this evening, and went to a show. 27/2/18. "X" Carrier went yesterday and I am on the roll of Carrier "D.2." We shall not be long now.
