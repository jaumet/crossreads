 I have been making a few sketches in my sketch book which may come in handy to look at sometime or other if I am lucky enough to get through. 
 23rd January Sunday 1916. 
 Don't lose sight of the fact that the Sand (soft sand) is still ankle deep and the calves of my legs are aching from having to wade through it all day 
 Church parade today I did not go I had several bags of mail to distribute also registered articles. tried to play football but the sand was too heavy. A very amusing incident happened to night. The armourer Sergt was blowing the bugle and the Trumpeter Sergeant told him it was contrary to regulations However the Armourer kept on with the result the Trumpeter jumped up and "went for that heathen Chinese". They clinched and fell on the ground and were locked in each others arms for the space of several seconds which strongly reminded me of two beasts locked in deadly embrace not forgetting - as is usual in such cases to upset everything in the tent I just saved the lamp in the Nick of time or that would have been mixed up in the melee. However they are going to fight it out in the morning (so they say) and I'm to referee.
