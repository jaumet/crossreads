Notified to be ready to march at a moment’s notice "Stand up by" all day with kit etc. Saw four of the ships leave about 3.30 p.m. We have an eagle’s view of proceedings – or rather we share the "goods" with a few thousand vultures. Went monkey hunting (We call it "Lion chasing") this afternoon. Saw one large ape at fairly close quarters but he only cursed us and walked into the vines backwards. Boys killed young green snake, nasty little brute with fangs like a cat’s. On Guard at 4 pm. All night job. Promises to be very funny.
5th Very funny guard all night. Spent my shifts with the Jamaicans, sampled some of their national and enjoyed a feed of canned tongue & chicken. Reveille at 5 am. Advance Guard 6 a.m. We headed main column & marched down about 9 a.m. to town. Drew our hammocks, & baggage from Admiralty store & carried same on to lighters. Following was my load with which I had to climb on & off lighter. Two kit bags, Equipment with pack filled, Hammock, & blankets, one oil sheet, Thermo, abt. 96 % humidity. Some load to carry up a swinging ladder, especially so if you are also smuggling sundry ripe fruit & & breakables that require careful handling & have a bottle of old Spanish Tosara down the leg of your pants. We found the Tosara in the store. It resembles sherry but is wonderful in its flavour & [indecipherable]
Shown our new quarters. The Deck board says L deck Messing 236. Sleeping 233. There
are 333 of us, we fill the space (not long before we discovered that an old freezing chamber had been prepared for our reception & christened L Deck) Enough regulations on this boat to sooner or later [indecipherable] individual of a regiment of angels
