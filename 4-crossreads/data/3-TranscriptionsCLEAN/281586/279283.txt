  
 4 The ghosts of prayers and cries and tears The Ghosts of Good deeds done Passing and Shuddering, gliding by Solemnly, one by one Silently, one by one 
 5 Ghosts of Faith and Hope and Truth, Memories brought from the Womb Of byegone days, (what a host there are) Passing again to the Tomb The still and Desolate Tomb 
 6 Ah me, they are only Ghosts to day, But the Sin that slew them is here Lusty and strong, astraddle the   tomb  Graves Of the past I held so dear The Past with its memories dear. 
 7 They pass, and a lonely road of pain As I bow my head, I see For the tender Joys of a nobler past Will never come back to me. No, never return to me.
