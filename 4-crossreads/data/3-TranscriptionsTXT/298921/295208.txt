 August, 1915 Wednesday 25 Suppose I should write a lot but in bed I seem to fill the time sleeping &amp; reading. Egyptians in Tarbushes (Fez) wait on the officers &ndash; Greasy soup, Macaroni stuff I feed the sparrows out of the window with it &ndash; Mine is an iron bed, but most of the soldiers are made of Palm Leaves &ndash; or rather the Ribs &ndash; Another Officer Capt Lawry 1st L.H. just arrived from Anzac wounded. We have made no progress over there - &amp; losing men daily- I shall be longer in bed than I expected but have no pain &ndash; but I hate the Hospital with its smell of Chloroform &amp; operations &amp; dead men &amp; crutches etc. etc; really tho' I am thankful to be spared.
