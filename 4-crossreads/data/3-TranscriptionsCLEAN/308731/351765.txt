  
 I can't write much because I can't think of anythink.  I am going to start a letter for you on Sunday that's all I know. 
 Much love from Ruth xxx etc. ooo etc. 
 [Note from mother] A P.S of my letter.  I  am  have written my letter in front of room heater - we do as you used to always like doing - bring room heater into our bedroom & sit round it & warm our nighties on it - the dining room keeps nice & tidy - but oh! The poor bedroom in the morning would cause grandma heart failure.  It is 11 here now - so will be in the afternoon where you are - as I suppose it is much the same in France. I dare not let myself think of where you might be & what you might be doing.  Dear Arthur I do not  worry  about you really.  I only think & think, & hope & hope - I don't often ever feel  miserable  - & what do you think I am 9 stone 4 - 10lbs heavier than when you went - I was 9/2 when we were married. But 10/2 when at Young - so expect to see a great fat floppity old thing when you come back to me next Christmas.  Perhaps you could manage to get off this winter - because it would be more cosy now than in the summer.  Lots & lots of very best love. From Annie
