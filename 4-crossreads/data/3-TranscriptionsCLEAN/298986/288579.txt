  
 so Collier & I went in per crowded tram.  It is a fine City wide streets & clean looking buildings, but we saw very little of it as it started to rain soon after we got there.  Had 2 meals 2 eggs each, each time. 
 Saturday 12th 
 Nothing in particular except the usual C.Os inspection in the morning. 
 Sunday 13th 
 Went to church in evening.  It was really a lecture on Repration, not very briliant.
