Passing the Italian fleet some of their larger dreadnoughts having gone up the Adriatic into Austria after being moored here in Taranto during the past 4 years as they could not go to sea on account of the submarine menace.  The British pre Dreadnought Queen still moored inside &amp; several British destroyers, also a French battleship &amp; destroyers, otherwise the harbour is full of Italian ships of war &amp; about 15 cargo steamers of which 10 of them were empty &amp; awaiting orders, yet they say there is a shortage of shipping, also several troop ships.  French &amp; British busy loaded up with troop for garrison &amp; demobilision.  At 5 p.m. we commenced disembarking troops into barges.  The troops leaving without their tea &amp; not likely to get anything until the next morning, bad management again, they complained bitterly.  At 8 p.m. all the troops disembarked &amp; baggage.  We found our troops would be there in camp for about 7 days, as they had 30,000 troops in camp &amp; were sending to England by rail 12,000 a week &amp; off course the trains could not cope with the work.</p>
