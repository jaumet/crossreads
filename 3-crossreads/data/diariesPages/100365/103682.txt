month I can assure you.
3.8.16I am now billeted in a wealthy Parisians Country Shooting Lodge which he has thrown open for use I can tell you it is some class. Beautiful massive furniture beds to say nothing of wonderfully exquisite clocks ornaments in cards room.I am now busy taking in Imperial ASC men who were in the retreat from Mons. They are coming through from Havre and Ruen. I fancy we are going to evacuate the Canadians.Rumour has it that the biggest Bombardment of the war is about to open this week judging by last nights preliminary one, I am wondering if the world is strong enough to withstand it.The concussion in the air can be felt for miles. Last night the shells were so thick that they were meeting one another in the air exploding.I am expecting another move from here shortly what with moving looking after 360 men I can assure you my time is fully occupied.The Town of Albert is wonderful to look at. There is scarcely a brick standing, where once a big beautiful city was situated. So much for big Guns destructive enemies.
