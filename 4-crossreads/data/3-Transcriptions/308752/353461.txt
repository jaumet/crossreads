<p>occurred.</p>
<p>June 27th. 1917.<br/>Myself &amp; two other chaps received unexpected orders to report at the Medical Stores in A for duty. Arrived there at 10 a.m. a very nice job packing<br/>drugs &amp; medical stores etc. living in a comfortable billet &amp; having good meals. This job will do me.  Unfortunately on Sunday the 1st July &amp; Permanent Base men arrived so of course we had to return to our Unit again. On arriving at the Amb. I found near by a big Church parade being held by the Brigade.   General Birdwood, the G.O.C. of the Division were present, also Mr. Holman.</p>
<p>A great number of decorations were presented. Or course plenty of bouquets were hurled at us by Mr. Holman. For the last two weeks a portion of the Amb. section has been training for a competition &amp; an Assault at Arms</p>
