<p>August, 1915<br/>Sunday 15<br/>Every day better &amp; every day + trains bring more wounded 30000 casualities so far, but the Peninsular is ours if all accounts are true &ndash; I am still afraid to give you names of the different military successes. [indecipherable] Censor but he should hardly block these simple notes &ndash; there is one thing I am a thankful man to be here alive &amp; kicking casualties have been so heavy 3rd Batt Infantry after three days fighting a Subaltern was O.C. &ndash;</p>
