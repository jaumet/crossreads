<p>a walk along the lanes which are covered with gorse in full bloom of golden flower.  The sunset tonight has been glorious, predicting a fine day to-morrow.  The birds to-night are so chirrupy &amp; gay that the whole world seems one lovely sweet song.  I am very happy to think that I have finished with V.D. &amp; expect the Home so soon that the whole world seems lovely.</p>
<p>It is 9.30 pm but still light &amp; I am writing in my Cousin's little study.  It is a lovely room &amp; is quite like Home for there are more photos of ourselves on view than I have got at Home.  Well, it is just dark so I'll say au Revoir.  I shall write again when I get back to Forant.</p>
<p>Love from all here &amp; your own Boy<br/>Harry</p>
