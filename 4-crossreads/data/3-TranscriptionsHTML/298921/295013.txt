<p>February, 1915<br/>Tuesday 9<br/>Met Col White of Gen Staff &amp; went Ordnance at Citadel the most beautiful morgue built by Mohammed Ali, it was here that the Mamluk were invited to dine &amp; then were murdered, I cannot describe the Alabaster columns, Marble floor &amp; colored glass all most beautiful, it is the Tomb of the Rhedive. Many dying beggars hanging around &amp; starving &ndash; Came back &amp; had Bath at Shepherds Hotel &amp; paid men in the evening &ndash; quite a brain worry converting LSD into Piastres.<br/>Much sand blowing today.</p>
