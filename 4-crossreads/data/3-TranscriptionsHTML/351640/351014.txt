<p>A few days ago I had a letter from Mrs Bacon, of The Astor Macquarie St., telling me that she is coming to Cairo, and asking me for information. She thinks that she has two boys &ndash; sons &ndash; somewhere in these parts. She comes by the Maloja. I asked, by letter, Mrs Newmarch to meet her &amp; look after her. I am sure that she will do so.</p>
<p>How long shall I be here?<br/>8. p.m.: On looking through your envelope I see that the sheets for you taken together form a respectable letter, which I hope may be pleasing to you.</p>
<p>When my movements are decided upon I shall jot some more words down and send them after this.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I shall conclude by asking you to give to all my friends my best wishes &amp; regards, &amp; to accept for yourselves heaps of love &amp; loads of kisses. From my Kitty no letter has come for a long time, perhaps midst the gaities of Cesnock she forgot all about a P. O. M. far away across the world. Naughty Kitty dear.</p>
<p>Your affectionate &amp; loving father<br/>John B. Nash</p>
