beast of a horse kicked me on the shin. Of for the humdrum days of peace!They can't  leave us alone even here after dragging us out 30 miles into the desert. Tomorrow night - I believe - we are going out for a two or three day's "stunt" with the   alledged  alleged object of rounding up an out post of Johnny Turk,After that Rumour says that we are going to leave here  &  embark for somewhere she apparently does not know where.
