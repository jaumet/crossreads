<p>victory in the Balkans; - that will be settled politically I think.</p>
<p>Monday 27th March</p>
<p>Inspection by Sir Archibald Murray, who has taken Sir John Maxwell's place as G.I.C. of the forces in Egypt.<br/>This is the third important inspection, since I have been here.  First we had Sir John Maxwell, - then Sur. Gen. Ford of R.A.M.C.<br/>Every one was hoping the Prince of Wales would be on Murray's retinue, for he is one of his staff officers;  but he never came.<br/>The German attack on Verdun seems to have spent itself &amp; the Russians</p>
