 When machine guns 
 were busily clacking 
 And bullets buzzed 
 round like Bees 
 Who always did the 
 attacking 
 Us blokes who came 
 overseas 
   
 When our mothers 
 hearts were yearning 
 Sorrows Cup was 
 drained to the Lees 
 While glory & fame we 
 were earning 
 Us blokes who came 
 overseas
