<p>dispensary into a more central position Had the marque cleaned out &amp; sprayed with cresol in the morning &amp; then with a gang of 6 men shifted into the new quarters It was solid work with noone but myself to arrange everything. Luckily business was slack so that I was not greatly troubled concerning the dispensing.</p>
<p>Monday 23rd. Strong wind blowing with clouds of dust, most unpleasant. Strengthened the guys &amp; dug a trench in case of bad weather. Had issued today insect powder, tooth brush &amp; tooth powder. Red Cross stores coming to hand now are very welcome although Tis a job to get them, just like drawing blood out of a stone to get them issued.</p>
<p>Tuesday 24th Heavy wind blowing with clouds of dust, the harbour being almost obscured. Reports of new landing very satisfactory the position being explained by means of military map by a Captain to me today. I have also been fortunate enough to meet two australian soldiers who had a grasp of the situation &amp; could speak of it fairly without exaggeration, a very rare thing. From them I received much valuable information concerning operations.</p>
<p>25th slight rain during the day. A band from H.M.S. Cornwallis came ashore today</p>
