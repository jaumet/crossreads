<p>8.</p>
<p>Monday I am going to Wales for a while.</p>
<p>We are wondering here where our troops have been taken to. I think they are on the Canal &ndash; I do hope we get a chance at the Turks there.</p>
<p>I have seen Leslie Whitfield of course &ndash; he is now busy learning the art of flying I believe. Young Anderson-Stuart is staying here with me at present.</p>
<p>Please remember me to Keith &amp; George Edward.</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours</p>
<p>F. L. Flannery</p>
