Apl 25 German sniper.  Just put my rifle through the loophole & was drawing a bead on him when - Bang - his bullet smashed on to the iron plate of my loophole. Hardly knew what had happened at first but the blood soon put me wise  Stretcher Bearers bound up my nut & poor old Harry rushed out of our dugout (not knowing how badly I might have got it)Walked a mile or two to the AMC where the wound was washed & dressed & then tramped a couple more miles to the Motor ambulance which took us to an Aust Hosp where the wound was again washed & dressed & I was blanketed & given hot water bottles. Went from there to an Eng Hosp at Merville where 2 or 3 Docs examined the eye. Am afraid it wont be much good to me again -
