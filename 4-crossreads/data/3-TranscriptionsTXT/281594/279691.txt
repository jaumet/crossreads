 in vogue in Paris, a system which is so simple that we found our way about in them in a short space of time. 
 Aug 14th. Went with one of the Y.M.C.A. Excursion Parties to the beautiful Palace of Versailles. There was a party of a hundred. 
 Had dinner in the Hotel De Suisse. We had a good guide with us. He explained everything very minutely. 
 The Place is built of   Granite  Marble, the walls are simply a mass of beautiful paintings which I am unable to describe. The chapel is a most beautiful place  These grounds are wonderfully laid out. The statutory, unfortunately have all been built up, with sand bags for protection from shells and bombs of the enemy, so that we were not able to see what like they are but I fancy they are in accordance with the magnificence of the whole place. 
 Had a group photo taken in front of the Palace. The Salon de Glace is especially worthy of note  This is a huge room with huge mirror all around the walls. It was used as a ballroom and when all the Aristocrasy of France were there in all their ballroom magnificence it must have been a most gorgeous assembly indeed. [It was in this Salon. the the Peace Treaty was signed.]
