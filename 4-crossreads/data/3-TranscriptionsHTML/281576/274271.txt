<p>Sat. Sept. 8.  Herford, Hand, Sullings &amp; a number of others returned from Leave.  They stayed a number of days over time &amp; this morning they paid the penalty.  Herford &amp; Hand lost their stripes &amp; Sullings got 7 days 2nd F.P.  [field punishment]  Bad Luck to get caught.  Gas drill.  After Tea Jacko &amp; I went for a stroll.  We passed a very fine chateau, so on our way back to our Billet we walked through the grounds.  It is a beautiful building &amp; the grounds are very pretty.  A stream runs through the grounds &amp; is crossed by a number of quaint little bridges.  Two bonnie little girls were playing on the Lawn &amp; near them was a Fountain sending up the water in a fine spray.  A lady &amp; gent drove up to the front door while we were seated in the grounds.  Evidently they were the owners.  Sight of it made us both feel quite Homesick.</p>
<p>Wrote Letter to M.S.  <br/>Sun. Sept. 9.  Fine sunny day.  We marched down to Wardrecques to attend Church Parade.  The Battns. were already there &amp; the Band was in attendance.  We were kept waiting for about &frac12; an hour for the Padre, but he failed to turn up, so the Band played "God save the King" &amp; we returned to out Billets.</p>
<p>Mon. Sept 10.   Dave Fry was down at u>Aire today at the Aerodrome, &amp; the Flying Corps S.M. asked him if our Concert Party would go down there &amp; give 'em a show.  We are without a Piano, &amp; cannot give Concerts to our own crowd, so we decided to go down there as it would keep us in practice a bit.  We shall miss "Oriss".  In his last Letter he said that most likely he would be returning to Australia.  Lucky Beggar.</p>
