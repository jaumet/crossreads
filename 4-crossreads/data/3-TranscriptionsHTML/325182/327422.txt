<p>Went out to Turn House this morning to the Aerodrome.  Was taken for a <strike>fl</strike> 'flip' in a DH machine by Capt. Wood I.C.G. one of the best pilots there.  We flew <u>under</u> the Firth of Forth Bridge and I had a good look round.  We then returned to the 'drome.  This afternoon I was taken up again and we flew over Edinburgh.  It is a beautiful city seen from the air.</p>
<p>It has been a very interesting day.  We went to the King's Theatre this evening and saw Seymour Hicks in Cash on Delivery.  He was "full on". <strike>t</strike></p>
