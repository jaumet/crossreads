<p>mile after mile the atmosphere redolent of dead Turk as usual.&nbsp; At night fall we camp on a ridge near the road &amp; outposts are put out.&nbsp; <s>It is my first turn on</s> <sup>I am first for </sup>duty &amp; I sit with the receiver to my ear.&nbsp; A cold wind is blowing &amp; I hear the occasional crack of a rifle &amp; the rat a tat tat of a machine gun.&nbsp; The Brigadier is lying on his blankets just near me &amp; I hear him ask the Brigade major if he would like some jam on his biscuit.&nbsp; Just then I get the news through that Bulgaria has surrendered &amp; call out to the General, who thanks me &amp; passes the good news on.&nbsp; I dont feel very well tonight &amp; am aching &amp; shivering all over.&nbsp; When relieved I scoop the rocks away with my foot &amp; lay down by the old mare &amp; sleep a feverish sleep.</p>
