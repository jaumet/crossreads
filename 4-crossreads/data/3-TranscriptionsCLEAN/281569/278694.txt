 Reveille at 0500 
 Mr Smith arrived back OK & is looking splendid after his holiday, his wound has healed beautifully Jack Braithwaite was here at the time so a reunion was effected. Things exceptionally quiet today. The Russians seem to be still pushing ahead & gaining more ground & prisoners portion of the Austrian army has been cut off in Flanders, our fellows are doing well & continue to capture prisoners & positions.

 Revielle as usual 
 The 2nd Bde went out on the stunt today, they are making for Bir-el-Abd & more to the left again the plane has been reporting men & camels there continually for the last few days so the 2nd are going to fix matters. 
 No mail on the skyline yet, its 8 wks now since one came to light so there ought to be a batch in any day now. 
 All hands have been going to bed early lately on account of our last stunt we can't seem to get over it & catch up with the sleep.
