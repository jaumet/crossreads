<p>Even the wounded are plucky &amp; full of chaff. One passed us just now who had been hit in the thigh some hours ago. &ndash; One of our fellow said something &amp; the fellow called out "Saida", wh. is the Australian way of saying good bye since Egypt. We have retained some words which are used &amp; misused more than the English equivalent. &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</p>
<p>Clark looks after me well. Yesterday he got some potatoes &amp; when asked how he was cooking them said "Frying &amp; boiling them at the same time".

Fresh beef has arrived but fire wood is non est &ndash; only broken boxes &amp; green twigs from the scrub &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash;</p>
<p>My bang is not at all sore but an area of about 6 inches by 5 is purple &amp; green from the blow &ndash; on the calf. Most of us are bruised &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; I recommended the extreme bravery of a young fellow called Crisp, who at extreme peril, volunteered to <strike>a</strike> save a wounded man lying almost vertical on a hill across a chasm from us &amp; only a few yds below a Turkish trench. After an hour he got him in &amp; the Brigade backed up my report at once.</p>

It <u>behoves every Australian youth to come to our assistance</u>, or &ndash;</p>
