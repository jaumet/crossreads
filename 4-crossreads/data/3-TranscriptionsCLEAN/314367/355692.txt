Well - its war time - Something may have been done - They've had from Sept to now to get beds up - Why the devil they haven't done it nicks me - My men want to sling their 'ammicks there & asked me but I've no authority off a ship - I told Commander D. & he said lying on the floor alone wd make him ill - His costume is a singlet & a Rami - His navg lieut - wears a Rami only - I believe Rami is feminine & Lava Lava is the male garment but it matters not. Sports this aft - I'm going so I will spell on - I went - The sports were held at No 2 pier - What spoilt the effect was that at least 1/4 of the men were nude - now 'lava lava' costume was the one thing needed & it should not have been omitted - The Administrator (Pethbridge) was present - I stayed some time - Swimming - Catamaran racing - Our men in our whaler won the oar contest by 4 lengths - This is due as I tell Fitz to physical drill & constant exercise - Keep it going I say -
