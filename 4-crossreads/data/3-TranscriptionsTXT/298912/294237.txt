at 6.00 & we had to turn out. It was so cold during the night that I had to get up & put my leather vest on. I then had on a singlet, cardigan, sheep skin vest, & overcoat  & even then it was cold. The water to wash in was like ice & numbed one, but the air was glorious.The first parade was stables, when we had to clean them out, feed & water the horses. When "feed up" is blown on the trumpet a ( bugle is only used in infantry & others, but bugles are used for the mounted troops) all the horses in camp neigh & stampede. They know every call. All the work we get is horses ! horses! Horses!
Thanks to the Egyptian Govt we get a decent feed here, The Govt allow each man 81/2 (eight pence halfpenny) worth of rations every day. This must be in rations & we get butter, pineapples, sugar condensed milk, treacle, etc, etc, allowed to us at the rate of 81/2 per man per day. This is in addition to the usual rations. Life is worth living now [at meals] & today I had the best feed I ever had in camp & I feel  - full, to be polite. Two letters have already arrived for me from the girls I dropped notes to, in Melbourne
