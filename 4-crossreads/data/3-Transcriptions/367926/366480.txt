<p>Somewhere in  France<br/>4.9.18</p>
<p>My Dear Aunt,</p>
<p>I expect you will be wondering what has become of me for not writing for such a long time, things have been pretty busy of late, by the time you get this letter you will have heard about  it all. I do not know what makes you think that I am in the Infantry, although I am attached to them, but not when they are in the line, you know that we cannot take horses into the trenches. It is rumored here that all the 19th men are going to be sent back to Australia for a short furlough, but do not  [indecipherable] too much on this, as there are quite a number of them left &amp; they are not being sent away too quickly according to the pay they are being given, it will be about two more years before I get my turn, providing I am last on the list somebody has to be it, so I hope it is not me. I am sending you a photo of the company taken just before the big push, I am seventh from the left in the second row. I might say that we all had a good clean up for the occasion, if you look close into the photo you will see a monkey on the shoulder of the man standing behind the officer on the right. I might tell you Aunty  that we have had "Jacko" since 1914 we bought him in Egypt from an Arab for about one shilling, he was only a baby then, &amp; as shy as any child could be, but let anybody try to take anything from him, however the funny part of it is I can do</p>
