Left Columbo at 11.20 AM. Before going some natives came near & dived in for pennies thrown in by us. Could get them before they got 1 yard down. Travelled 4 miles up to 12 o'clock. Had a very interesting lecture from 3 till 4 by the war correspondent about the Emden & Sydney fight. The Sydney lost 3 Killed &  13 wounded of which 1 died. &  the Emden lost 132 Killed & 52 53 wounded of which 1 officer &  4 men died. The Emden was a complete wreck when she surrendered &  fired 1500 0  shots of which 15 took effect. The Sydney wasn't damaged much at all &  fired 650 0  shots of which 70  took effect. We took altogether about 150 prisoners. While we had this lecture the prisoners on board were being exercised. Lights were made very dull at 8 o'clock. Fell asleep in another cabin &  woke up at 3.30. Went into my own bunk then.
