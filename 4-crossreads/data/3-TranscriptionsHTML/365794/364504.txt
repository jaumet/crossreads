<p>Friday 13 [12] April 1917 [1918]<br/>A letter today from Miss Hunt.  Kind &amp; reports all going well &amp; Wilga overfull.  How homesick do I feel hearing of my little garden &amp; all the details of life there when am laid aside in a lonely land with not one human being to whom I can speak.<br/>O.C. visits me &amp; am gazed upon as so much wood or machinery that has to be repaired &amp; sent on duty again.  Wonder where these "men"? came from &amp; how can there be such a gap between our live dear Australians &amp; these creatures in men's clothes with no feeling or mind inside them.</p>
