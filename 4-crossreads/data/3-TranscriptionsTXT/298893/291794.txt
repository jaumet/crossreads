 Lieut Boyden, I have examined bombs on Monash &amp; Hintons posts &amp; found 13 defective in Monash &amp; 9 defective in Hinton's. The bombs have been exposed to the weather &amp; need more attention. I have replaced the defective bombs with new ones &amp; in addition have placed 2 boxes of 6 second match headed Cricket Ball bombs at Hinton's Post &amp; 1 box of the same pattern bombs at Monash Gully. Would you mind informing the N.C.Os  in Charge of the bombs to see that the bombs are not exposed to the weather. Thanking you A Gray RSM
