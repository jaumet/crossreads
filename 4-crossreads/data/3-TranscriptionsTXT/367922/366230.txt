real and deep sympathy.
I never met Dene personally, but I have corresponded with him regularly since early in 1912. I value his letters, & I got really to love him through them. In many ways he was a great help to me in my work. I greatly admired his ability and enthusiasm, & the work he was able to accomplish shows how great a loss to Australian science his death really is. As he was associated with our Queensland Royal Society, we shall see to it that a worthy tribute is paid to him at our next meeting.
Should you, later on, have a photo of him to spare, I should very greatly value it.
Very sincerely yours,Heber A. Longman
