<p>So! That's good I have have wondering for the last 16 months when this order was coming into vogue. It's the best thing that possibly could happen. These lads simply waste good material and if they haven't got anything to go on parade with they simply walk on parade without it and if anything new is given them they simply don't look after it believing as they do that if an article is not satisfactory they have simply to ask for another By being made to pay for all shortages it will teach them 2 important things one is to take care of their Kit</p>
