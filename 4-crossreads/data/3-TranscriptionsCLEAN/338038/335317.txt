  
 Brigade Major, Major  C.W. Bates of the R.F.A. 
 This is a senseless sort of letter  but I don't want the mail to go out without some sort of a line to you. 
 I have not been sending any letters to Pat lately, thinking he would have left   If not of course give him my love. 
 With all my love dear Father & Mother 
 I am your loving Son Terence
