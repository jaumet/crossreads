evening reading Pelman.  Trouble with Jensen again & after lot of trouble found I was going with Boot to meet party at 10.10 below Battalion & to get tools there.  Party came alright but pontoon wagon went past so we went over to estaminet.  One shell fell close so I sent party back to trench & officer waited while Jensen marked out job.  Infantry party went home.  Had to wait a good while & when he returned went to Linton's job and then to Groth who had gone home.  We went home then about 12.  Raid at 12.30 but very quiet and heard 80 casualties & failure.  Supper & bed.  Enemy plane dropped 6 bombs quite close to village but no damage apparently.  Bed.
20.6.18Up at dinner time & in aftn. wrote diary & Pelman.  Fine.  Carter taking Sarre's place and Sarre going on to job I left last night.  Out with Groth at 9 and very lively near Battalion.  I had Sparkes & Stott & 3 infantry carrying cupolas from dump and very lively with M.G.  One bullet just touched my neck near spine and another hit a man's equipment in front but none did any damage.  Gas shell fell about 20 yds from us and we just escaped fumes.  Left at 12.30 and home to bed after supper.  A good deal of rain during evening and ground sloppy so came home by road through Pradelles.
21.6.18Fine but some rain in evening.  Got up at 12 and spent leisure on reading mail.
