(six of us) & after repaying 45 francs advanced first day we have 105 left aproximately 3-10-0 - good pay. The Pay-officer here (Capt McKay) is one of the best. Anticipating leaving for the front I spend two hours to-night packing away all my souvenirs gained in my travels to send to Mother. Expenses to-day light - 1 1/2 francs
19th August:- SaturdayArrived at Hdqus to find the usual amount of work. Just graft  Put my head    & go it hard until 12-30 pm. The amount of casualties coming in for the 2nd Division is astounding & the harder one goes the more comes along. Just before leaving W.O. Oliver informs me that we must work this afternoon (my Asst & I) & & this after Capt Parker told us all to get out    & have some fresh air. Great life this. Work & nothing but it &  not even a few hours to oneself. Being
