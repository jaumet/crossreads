Wed 5th Oct.At 5.30 am. "Wolf" pulled away from "Hitachi" and steamed out onto the trade route.
We all felt that we would have gladly exchanged the excitement for a peaceful transfer to the "Hitachi" as she lay behind us, placidly at anchor.
Dr Flood etc stood at the rails and waved "good-luck" to us as we pulled out.
'Plane rose at 2.30 pm
Thu.  4th Oct."Wolf" is cruising up and down on the one route changing from N.E. to S.W. every few hours or so.
Sat.  6th Oct.At 2 am this morning the alarm bell rang.   All cleared for action on deck.   I managed to slip up to the poop door in the bustle - on deck the guns and tubes were manned, it was a clear moonlight night, and a warrant officer was focusing on a mark on the starboard beam.
We were hustled below and the torpedo doors fell.
