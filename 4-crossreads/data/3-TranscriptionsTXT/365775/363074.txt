in the daylight I wondered that any of them got back. We were only in this position a few days when we pulled our guns back behind the next ridge. I do not think I shall ever forget that experience &amp; I do not think any one was sorry to be out of it.
Took us all night to get the guns back. we had twelve horses in each gun, at times the gun would almost sink out of sight. the horses sinking to their bellies in the mud, taking all their strength to keep on their feet. if one went down he was almost sure to have to stop there, in fact we lost three horses harness &amp; all that night, got in a shell hole &amp; had to leave them.
