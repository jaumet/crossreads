Monday July 14th
When the boys awoke at 6 am, we were still jogging along at 12 Knots an hour with Land in sight and a strong head wind blowing, at 11 am long range of hill's around Durban came into view and all hands were somewhat excited and large numbers dressed and all polished awaiting to go ashore, at 12 noon we rounded the Point and steamed slowly into Harbour having picked up a Pilot outside, we did not turn in the harbour but came right in and made fast to the Quay at 1 Pm. No Orders were issued about Leave and everybody was on pins needles, awaiting to go ashore. Our Old friend Miss Campbell met us at the Entrance to the harbour with her Red Yellow Flags signalling to us, the boys on board gave her a hearty cheer at their pleasure of seeing her once again. At 1-45 Pm the Married Couples began to go ashore down the Gangway Aft and the Diggers started to follow after being told by the Adjutant to fall in on Shore to march up to the Town. Naturally the Boys agreed but did not intend to keep their word, as soon as they stepped Ashore they made for the "Jimfish" for a Ride in their Rickshaw's, while numbers boarded the Tram. Naturally I was amongst the number and managed to get standing Room at the back of a Car, and away we went passing several Boy's with their Wives in the Rickshaw's as happy and full of laughter, it being quite a novelty to the Women Folk. We all expected Cold Weather being the Month of July but were surprised to find it quite hot and clear.
