11/12/17 Mt. Kemmell
Battalion paraded less 200 men on fatigue and we did some ceremonial before going on to other work. N.C.Os school in full swing. Raiding party working on the bombing ground under Hutton. Picked suitable ground and positions for a demonstration to be given before General Smythe on Thursday. Put 50 men and Keith Sutherland on the job of digging the facsimile trenches linking up the existing breastworks. After lunch there were boxing contests and some men went away on a pipe laying job. Rode into Bailleul on my new black charger and had my teeth attended to. It became dark very early and a good nip of frost was in the air. Some heavy explosions during the evening and an incessant mutter of gun fire. Attended "C" Coys. dinner and made a speech. After the loyal toast several singers came on with ribald songs which of course brought down the house.
