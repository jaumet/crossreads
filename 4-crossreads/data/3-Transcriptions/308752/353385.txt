<p>time, we manage the carry in less than an hour. The roar of the Artillery was deafening, this night bearing is a great strain on ones nerves.</p>
<p>Sunday 26th November.<br/>Still raining heavily &amp; plenty of work, dug-out almost flooded out. Fritz very angry again, a great number of shells coming over in our direction. One burst in one of our dug-outs but fortunately it was not occupied. The lucky 8th again.  Nick Coxan &amp; Tom Ross had a narrow escape, the shell burst about 2 yards from their dug-out. We should all thank the Almighty that we are still safe. Enjoyed some good tucker in our dug-out today. cocoa, &amp; Milk, fried bacon &amp; fried bread. Our Tent Division &amp; the remainder of our Ambulance are about 30 miles from the Straffe living in a comfortable billet, an old Chateau I believe. Lucky beggars would not mind changing our wet &amp; chatty home in the Trench</p>
