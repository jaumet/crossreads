<p>June 7th:- Private M- arrived here today sick, and under open arrest, he having been picked up in London where he had been "adrift" for a month or more. He told me <strike>that</strike> he and his "cobber" Private W- had gone on fourteen days leave* to England. They were well "walletted", having &pound; 350 between them the major portion of which had been amassed at the "two-up" schools. They took fashionable rooms in the Morley Hotel, one of the swell establishments in London. The &pound; 350 was spent in royal style, and both "diggers" slept in silk pyjamas: expensive wines were liberally consumed, while porters, waiters, and "the boots" were tipped into a state of absolute subserviency. On one occasion these two fellows happened to be going up in the lifts to bed somewhere about 2 a.m., when they encountered several Yank officers, one of them, a Major, said: "You boys having a good time. &ndash; I feel a bit thirsty myself." This led to an invitation to the Aussie's apartments, and there was an "all night sitting".</p>
