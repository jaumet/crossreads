Mon 25th June (cont.)Also, at 9 pm mines began to come up from the next hold.   We could hear each mine being brought up in the lift, trundled along the rails and finally pushed out through the mine-doors.
25 were laid - we believe we are in the region of the North Cape - possibly between there and Three Kings.
Wed. 27th JuneWe sighted Egmont through the Canvas curtains placed over the poop entrance.   At night Monday evening's performance was repeated - our guard was doubled - we were to be shot if we tried on any pretext to ascend the narrow wooden ladder, and the mines began to come up about ten.   During our hour on deck we yesterday saw the mines coming up & coming along to remain on the rails under the poop till needed.  The mines are the usual barrel-horned-type with combined carriage and anchor.
45 were laid here in Cook's Straits.
