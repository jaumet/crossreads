 1916   THURSDAY 12   OCTOBER 
 Fine but cloudy. Lord only knows when we will see the sun again, & we do miss it so, more than anything else in this country I think. Loading ashes all day & bringing them round to the stables. Got two old letters from Linda, & one from father & one from Marj. They tell me I am to be a driver, but bye the Lord I am bucking against that.
