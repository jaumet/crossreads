<p>77<br/>in a picture show, the cheapest part of which usually costs 3 francs here.</p>
<p>Room is a chaos of disorder but Brise is a gem &amp; soon place is straight enough to sleep in. I dine with Brise &amp; then collect baggage from Gare du Nord, &amp; then see Brise home.</p>
<p>On the afternoon I had collected baggage from Marignon &amp; said good bye to Rue du Sommerard. Although I had given over my room 5 days before leaving yet lady refused to let me have one night in addition &amp; I told the maid she might have compromised</p>
<p>24-7-19<br/>Rose 9 am &amp; at 9.30 Brise arrived with cheese, bread, coffee, milk etc &amp; went out for warm milk. We start in to clean up &amp; in course of a thorough search find punaise in the divan. This causes great consternation &amp; energetic measures are taken</p>
<p>Brise is desolated for she has found these rooms for me &amp; is ashamed of her recommendation I on the other hand am quite pleased</p>
<p>25-7-19<br/>Brise arrives early again armed</p>
