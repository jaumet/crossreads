Of course I had a little cry of joy when I read my long-looked for letters. Best news too &ndash; no doubt you will all be very delighted to know I had an awfully nice, loving letter from Lucy, in answer to one  wrote her.  So please do all make friends again &amp; let by-gones be by-gones. She is very lonely &amp; would love to see "dear Auntie Belle" but thinks you don't want her. Oh, poor old Lucy, I do feel sorry for her &ndash; I'm that pleased she wrote such a nice letter  &amp; that it makes me feel happy now to know that we are friends once more. Will write to her to-morrow night &ndash; am fearfully sleepy now. We had a most delightful afternoon</p>
