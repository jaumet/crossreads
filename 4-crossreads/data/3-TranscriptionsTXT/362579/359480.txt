 on Friday afternoon, had tea with Sister O'Dwyer   &amp;  some other friends at Southwell Gardens &ndash; then went to Myra's for dinner   &amp;  had a jolly time. Got back about 11. p.m. Shall not be able to go out much now. Packing to-morrow. Had a heavy fall of snow on Wednesday   &amp;  Thursday but very wet   &amp;  muddy yesterday   &amp;  today . 
 Am feeling very well. Heaps of love   &amp;  kisses. Hope you are all well. 
 Yours lovingly Edith
