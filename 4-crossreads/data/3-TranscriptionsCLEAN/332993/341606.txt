shot in an orchard a few nights ago while stealing apples by a Frenchman.  He received several fillets of shot in the back of one of his legs. He is in hospital.  He got a great fright but is not much hurt.  There will be an enquiry into it.
Sunday September 16. 1917. (1140)Dull & cloudy, but fine.  We put on a set of shoes this morning.Summertime in England ends on Monday at 3. am, when all clocks will be put back one hour to 2. am.  This will be Greenwich time.  The clocks in France will not be altered until next month.The German papers are buzzing with rumours that Britian has offered peace terms.  This suggestion is of course devoid of foundation.  Probably the intention is twofold; to alarm Russia & to divert the attention of the German people, in other words they are fooling the German public.  The promised extra meat ration has not appeared in Berlin & the bread ration is still short.  Petrograd seems further off than ever & it is not even certain that Riga is now "the German city."The Swedish & Mexican diplomatic exposure are no more cheerful reading to the Germans than the military news.  America's strength is at last being recognised.  Growing evidence of exhaustion cannot be ignoredToday I received two "Argus" of June 20 and 2, &"Hamilton Spectator" of June 21. from my sister.Although today is Sunday there was a foot ball match between B Company and the 10 field Ambulance.  The honours of victory were with the Field Ambulance.
