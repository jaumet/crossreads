<p>Fine but looked like a change in evening. Mother &amp; I went to service at the Cathedral &amp; I was very disappointed with the Service. It was totally different to any I ever heard before, long &amp; not to the point at all. Got a car&nbsp;<sub>^</sub><sup>in</sup>&nbsp;after dinner and went out to Tidsworth &amp; saw Struan. He has grown a fine Big fellow. We had tea in Tidsworth together &amp; then we took him back to camp &amp; I came on here with mother &amp; she went back to Salisbury after. I heard Pitt Brown was married on Thursday last &amp; Alan was best man.</p>
