<p>fiddle is a splendid player.  I met Joe Sellars here he is in the 2nd Battalion.  This sea sickness is hanging on me pretty tight, I feel squalmish all the time &amp; I can't vomit of course.  I have done so pretty often but it won't come for me most of the time.</p>
<p>10.3.16 Friday<br/>Have managed to eat two meals and hold on to them but am not yet sure of keeping them.  Slept on deck last night &amp; nearly perished with the cold.  We have passed Melbourne now 12.00 midday &amp; they seem to be preparing for heavy weather so I can see good times coming for me. I turned the ship inside out looking for soda water before Dinner &amp; couldn't get any still I managed some soup &amp; Bread &amp; Butter.  A lemon would have been usefull.</p>
<p>11.3.16 Saturday<br/>Now well in the bight. Still feel squeamish, we are packed like sardines.  The amount of gambling is astonishing.  I had the bad luck to break my fountain pen today.</p>
