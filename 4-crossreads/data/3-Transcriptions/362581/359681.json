<p>XOXOXOXOXOXOXXO<br/>My dearest Eddy,</p>
<p>How do you like school?. Hope you will be happy   &amp;  do well at your lessons. It is a great help in life to be well educated. I do hope my little nephew will be a clever boy   &amp;  have strength to continue on with his schooling.</p>
<p>I'm very sorry I did not work harder at school when I was a little girl. Heaps of playmates   &amp;  fun. Kisses   &amp;  fondest love from Auntie Eadle.</p>
