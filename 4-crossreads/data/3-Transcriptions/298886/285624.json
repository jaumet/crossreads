<p>reprimand them</p>
<p>7th August Mon 1916 Romani.</p>
<p>We have been having a good spell last night and all day today. We have been generally squaring up things and taking stock  Duffy wounded OHalloran missing one horse shot one missing also 5 saddles one Heliograph missing and one telescope smashed Not bad considering what we were up against &ndash; also one telephone and one Electric Signalling lamp.</p>
<p>However we got that back with interest. Among the medical comforts captured were rolls of iodoform gauze some of the packages were found to be abnormally heavy and on examination were found to be packed with revolver ammunition Oh! what a clever fellow the German is!</p>
<p>The regiment is going out on a strong reconnaissance at 7 pm to night we expect to be away for 3 days. but I hope under better conditions than last time. Our chaplain Captain Gordon has had a busy time the last couple of days in performing the last sad rites on our unfortunate and gallant comrades.</p>
<p>The entries in this diary for the last couple of days has been somewhat spasmodic and erratic but the main facts are here and at some</p>
