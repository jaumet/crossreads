Cook apparently gets a stroke for at 4pm free soup & coffee was issued to all (free) - Glorious sunset.
4/1/16Beautiful sunrise. Holiday all day on account of sports. Sea as calm and smooth as a pond & rather hot. The offices amuse themselves during the dinner time by shooting first at two sharks & then at jam tins & other articles thrown overboard.
Mock trial held on "H" deck that causes roars of laughter .Scotty tells an amusing tale about his rifle shooting. He spent all the morning, whilst at the range in trying to hit the bull's eye, but never even hit the target at all. After about thirty shots that all missed, the officer yelled out to him fix bayonets & see if he could stab it. This tale, told in the real Scotch tongue brought forth roars of laughter. Sunset of lovely golden colour that drew the troops to the side in wonder. The colours are impossible to describe. Some kind person nips my hammock & the only course open to me is to nip somebody els's. Another peculiar incidence noticed during the last few days. No accusations are
