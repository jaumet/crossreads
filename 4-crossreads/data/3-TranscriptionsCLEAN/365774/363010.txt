Kasr-el-Amy Hosp. 16th May 1915My dear Mother,I cabled to you today at least to Dave he will give you the cable. I couldn't do it before for the want of cash. No doubt the news of our attack would be in the Sydney papers by this and you will be anxious I know how much to know if I was hit or not, so to relieve your feelings cabled. Let Lizzie know as soon as possible how I am I cannot write much as I can't get in a position to do so, you can see by this writing how strained my position is, not that it hurts me but I can hardly move my thighs which anchors me completely.My left arm is healed up now, it being only a clean bullet wound, in one side & out the other, & only for a certain numbness it is OK. The left thigh is doing alright, it is a nasty wound though & will take a while to heal up, they have a tube through it to drain off pus etc. They operated on my right thigh & took a bullet out,
