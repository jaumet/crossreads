the Records Office. Visited the United Services Exhibition in the afternoon and went to the "Coliseum" (Variety) at night. The Coliseum is a beautifull Theatre splendidly designed. A Lady conducted the Orchestra. The Drop Curtain shows a procession of Artists who have previously appeared at this Theatre crossing a Stage.

Seen Ada Reeve at Anzac Buffet today. She is one of the finest women I have seen and looks better off the stage than she does on. She is quite as nice as she looks, without a bit of swank.
Seen two Convalescents at the War Chest at Dinner. They sat opposite me. They were both unable to hold a Tea Cup without spilling the contents (nerves gone). One was vainly endeavouring to eat, querelously complaining the while that he was as hungry as a hawk. He seemed to have an artificial Jaw. The other was frightfully disfigured. His head was out of shape, one cheek was crushed in, his eyes were out of line, a scar like an axe-cut was in the middle of his Cheek another encircled one of his Eyes, his nose was a button.
