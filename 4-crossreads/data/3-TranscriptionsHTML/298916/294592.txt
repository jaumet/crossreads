<p>Teddy who was wakened by this, began to hum "A life on the Ocean Wave" at the same time wedging himself between the bulkhead &amp; the bunk boards. I put in a most miserable time until eight o'clock when I wakened Teddy and went out for a breather, but had to return as the A13 was wallowing in the trough of the waves like a pig in mud. The wind howled through the rigging all day &amp; threatened to blow anyone over. About 1pm a cry of "Fire" was raised. The A13 was hove to &amp; an examination made. The Captain &amp; all the officers had pale faces, as fire is dreaded by all. It was located amongst the fodder in No1 hatch which is right "forrard". A hydrant soon extinguished it &amp; everyone gave a sigh of relief, as the A13 headed south again. That night I felt much better &amp; had come to the end of my troubles with seasickness. The soldiers poor fellows were lying in heaps in their quarters uttering groans &amp; wupps alternately. The soldiers were quartered on the shelter deck "forrard" which is reached by a gangway down No1 Hatch. There are numerous tables with small sideboards to keep the utensils from falling &amp; at the end of each is a cupboard on the bulkhead</p>
