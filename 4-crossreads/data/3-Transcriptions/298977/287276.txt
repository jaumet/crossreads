<p>England,<br/>29th November 1916.</p>
<p>My dear Parents,</p>
<p>It's a very sad letter that I am writing this time.  Roy died in Southmead Hospital, Bristol, yesterday after an illness of seven days brought on by a wound in the chest.</p>
<p>When I saw him on the Saturday, he was doing well I came back to the Camp on Sunday , but on Tuesday evening I received a wire from the Hospital to go over.  Was there by 6.30 on Wednesday morning and he was doing fairly, also Thursday but on Friday he had a bad day, and on Saturday he picked up wonderfully and the Doctors had every hope, and I had to return to Camp.</p>
<p>Received a wire from the Doctor on Sunday night late that he had passed away that morning.  Everything was done for him that could be done, both the Doctors and the Nurses were very good to him and I saw that he wanted for nothing while I was with him.</p>
<p>Double Pneumonia set in on the Monday caused by the shrapnel touching his lung and the cold and exposure that he had gone through.</p>
<p>He was buried in Bristol Cemetery this morning the coffin was carried to the Cemetery on a gun carriage (being awarded a military funeral).  I obtained leave to attend and return again to Camp to-night.</p>
<p>All his personal property has been forwarded to A.I.F. Headquarters London, and will be forwarded on to you by them.</p>
<p>With love to all,<br/>Your loving Son,<br/>W. E. Richards.</p>
