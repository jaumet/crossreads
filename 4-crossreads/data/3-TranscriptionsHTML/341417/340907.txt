<p>victory for the Australians although we had a lot to do. I was very lucky and came out in one piece but got a terrible bruise on my leg from a piece of dirt thrown up by one of Fritz's shells.<br/>The second fight was a bit more severe as we had to take the last of the Ridges in front of Westhoek Ridge. We had terrible weather for it but never the less the boys took the positions without any opposition. We nearly cried with laughter at the prisoners</p>
