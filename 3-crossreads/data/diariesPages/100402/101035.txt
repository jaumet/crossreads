Sunday 3 March
Dull with drizzling rain. We went to A.D.S. to-day at Woormezeele to work on completing dugouts. Very little is left of the village some graves about mention Oct. 1914, 1st Battle of Ypres. I walked up to St. Eloi, of which nothing is left. The country is rather hilly our people hold most of the high ground. Artillery lively in the afternoon but no casualties came through.
Monday 4 March
Another visit to A.D.S. on fatigue work on dugout, placing concrete slabs on the top.
