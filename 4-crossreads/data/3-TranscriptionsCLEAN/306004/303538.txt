  
 28.9.16 by a large palm grove & we all had a breakfast of fresh ripe dates ; Arrived at Hill 70 soon after midday, watered our horses & came up to a camp just vacated by Tommies with stables, mess huts everything very convenient & comfortable but in the filthiest state I have ever seen a camp & Gen Cox blew up the English Officers (left to hand over) properly & told them they would hear more of it from the G.O.C. We have always been very particular when leaving a Camp to leave it perfectly clean & the Tommies who were camped here are going to Romani to take our place there & they may benefit from the example this places looks as though it has not been cleaned for weeks.
