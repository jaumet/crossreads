 I found that we were not leaving till the next morning. Between one thing and another I was not in the best of humour, as per usual when excitement run high I had a severe headache. To add to it all I had not had much sleep, the weather was extremely hot and I had been inoculated in the afternoon, so that I was not in the best condition for long lours in the O.T. However C'est La guerre. 
 Sat 14th. July 
 During the night there was a great deal of aerial activity and, between the buzzing of the 'planes, the bursting of the anti-air craft shells, the flashes of the numerous searchlights, searching the skies, there was not much sleep for us that night  Luckily very few bombs dropped our way this night 
 Left for No 17 C.C.S. at Remy Siding near Poperhinge, this morning at 8 o'clock. 
 We quickly made our way along the road amidst a shower of rain and also thunder and lightning. 
 On duty there at 8 o'clock to-night. This being a British C.C.S. our quarters are very poor. In a crowded marquee amidst all sorts and conditions of men. 
 July 15th. Sun. Operating up till three in the morning. Walked out to near Poperhinge. Plenty of shells are sent over this way. 
 July 16th. Tues. Operating all day.
