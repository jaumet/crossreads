  
 April 1917 Wednesday 11th The Brigade got back into camp at 3 pm & we soon got the dust off us by a plunge into the sea.  Sharks have been seen & police patrol the beach  Got news of a big British success in France.  An Australian mail also arrived  I got 3 letters dated 25th Febry.  Posted letters to Doug & Roy 
 Thursday 12th We got a lecture on the use of gas helmets & it was very interesting  We will have to get a fair bit of drills to make us quick at using them  A Turkish aeroplane dropped a few bombs near the aerodrome, but came under heavy shell fire & nearly got hit  They are getting a great respect for our anti guns & fly at a great height.  Heard that the Scotties captured a Turkish outpost & some machine guns also that a German spy had been captured in our lines dressed as an Australian officer.  He was inspecting gun positions.  Our Brigade brought in 2 Turks & 2 Bedouins today  A watch from home arrived by packet registered post. 
 Friday 13th Our guns were more active today.  There was plenty of aerial activity
