<p>censored &amp; sent them on their way home.</p>
<p>Friday 1.9.16<br/>Fine again to-day: has been raining for almost a fortnight on &amp; off; a treat to see sunshine.</p>
<p>Saturday 2.9.16<br/>Walked to Bailleul, about 6&frac12; miles from here &amp; bought a few more articles to send home.  Feel the effects of the walk, for I have had no occasion to do any walking for the past month.  Bailleul a fine old town of no small dimensions.  Church a beautiful building, but very ancient; spent some time inside the building.</p>
<p>Sunday 3.9.16<br/>Played cricket against a team of Tommies from the Motor Machine Gun section &amp; again</p>
