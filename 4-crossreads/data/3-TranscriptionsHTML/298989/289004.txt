<p>Staging Camp Suez Canal<br/>8/3/16</p>
<p>Dawn broke foggy and cold and one did not lie long under the blanket wet with dew. Breakfast at 0700 and we found the dew had rusted the rifles completely overnight. All got to work at once and cleaned up and all the blankets and waterproof sheets were taken in on transport wagons. Moved company completely off the bivouac ground and cleaned it up. Inspected the men and roused about untidy packs and buttons undone. The Brigade were side by side in double mass of battalions and the 21st moved off at 0845 followed by us at 0900 to the crash of our bands. Our camp was right up against the side of the Canal along which run trenches which we veterans laughed at well knowing a few 75's would have knocked them to hell in no time. In rear of the camp was one lonely Muslim tomb with its double tombstones and raised mound of brick.</p>
<p>Bird was round with all our transport wagons. Swung out of camp in column of fours with band playing and crossed the canal on a pontoon bridge which swayed a bit. My horse was a new one and took some managing. The waters of Lake Timsah sparkled blue in the hot sun and the warships lay off at anchor, we passed a good many naval men, and some marines in their round caps. A number of aeroplanes were up and the men of the Royal Flying Corps were in prominence in their close fitting uniforms. Our fellows call them "the angels". Along the avenue into Ismailia a fine ashphalt motor track shaded with beautiful Ceylon bean trees and bounded on one side by the Freshwater Canal which Joseph is said to have built. Motor transport and trucks passing us, the fellows sweating under their heavy packs but going with a splendid swing whenever the band struck up. The cornet player was nearly done but kept going.</p>
