We marched through the town to the Station and got a board the train about 6.30. We loaded up 30 men to each covered van. There was plenty of clean straw and we didn't mind being crowded as it made us all warmer. As soon as we had taken off our packs we had a feed of bully beef and Bread and the cakes we bought. As there was no tea to be had we bought wine and coffee from the cottage near the station. We left Baileul about 7 and had a very pumpty ride, but in spite of it all, after a game of cards and a read, we turned in and slept soundly.
Wednesday 18th 
Arrived Longpre about 7 a.m. we had no rations and as soon as we pulled up there was a holy rush made for the Y.M.C.A. tent to purchase coffee and biscuits. Only about 200 got served the rest had to be hungry. The Y.M.C.A. is without doubt a Godsent to Soldiers, as they follow us up every where and any one who subscribes to its funds, gets a good sum for his money. We fell in about 11 and marched with full packs up through the mud and slush. The crowd were in good humour and good old B.Sec, led the way. We sang and passed remarks about the officers which is a favorite pastime among our crowd. "Molly" dashed by on his charger and someone told him to get inside and pull the blinds down. We marched along for about 2 miles then we had a spell. The country is very hilly and quite a number of B.Sec. had sore feet but with true Christian Fortitude they cried "Excelsior" and dashed onward. We got an awful shock to see our gallant officers marching with packs up. I'm sure that Capt. Woosters pack must have weighed nearly 2 lbs. yet he never faltered we halted for dinner about 12 and were issued with Bread and Bully beef and water to drink. The scenery was glorious, fine big trees and the green grass in the meadows showed off the red roofs of the houses to perfection.
