<p>The 50th Battalion moved from Steenvoorde today back to St. Omar, to undergo a school of instruction, so I suppose we will still continue to hang on here for some time.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>It is snowing in England &amp; we are getting the wind off it, consequently it is dam cold. The weather has again broken &amp; it is pouring down in torrents.</p>
<p>I had quite an interesting yarn with an ex Royal Navy Officer (J Chesney) who was present at the bombardment of Lao Chou &amp;  &amp; enjoyed every word of same.</p>
<p>18.9.16 Monday</p>
<p>The rain has been coming down in torents all day long &amp; does not show any signs of abating at all. I am living fairly well at present &amp; actually had a plate of stored mushrooms for tea tonight. I have occasion to send a few men out daily for green forage &amp; they always search round for them.. This item will provide us with many decent meals in future as they grow in fairly large quantities in this district.</p>
<p>I received letters from home today &amp; deeply regret to learn that Dallas Green has died of wounds. I am afraid that there will be many sorry homes in far away Australia</p>
