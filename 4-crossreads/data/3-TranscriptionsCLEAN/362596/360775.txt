 My Dear May, Just a few lines to let you know I am still going strong over this way. I'm sending you this P.C. as a souvenir but of course we completed our 1000 days some months ago, abut that makes no difference, this is the card. Well May I'll have to ring off hoping all are well as this scrawl leaves me at present  I remain Your loving Uncle Clarence
