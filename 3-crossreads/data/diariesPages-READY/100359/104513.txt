16th week.
Wednesday February 9
Last night I wrote to Lill and Mother and sent Xmas day Menu and snapshot of our crowd eating Xmas dinner, to both of them. This afternoon the Officers got a party of Arabs to give us a demonstration of mat making. It was very interesting and with a bit of practice we should be able to make mats for ourselves out of rushes and palm leaves. Bricky bought a camera and we spent the evening trying to make pictures, got a few good ones.
Thursday 10th	
Its about time we got a reply to our first batch of letters. Bricky took more photos. Brady, Bricky and self spent the evening printing gaslight pictures, some beauties. We ran out of supplies, so had to miss supper.
Friday 11th
Weather getting warmer. Bricky borrowed files from Cosier and we printed a few jolly good pictures, about 7.30 p.m., Ross, Woodsy, Doby, Kirby and I were just settled down to a quiet game of nap, when we heard several people sing out like mad "Stop that man, Stop him." Of course we all rushed out and saw the whole bloomin? ambulance rushing round in all directions, we joined in the chase, but who or what we were chasing no one seemed to know. After tearing around for a while we heard someone say "They've got him", so we returned to camp, and found out that the officers had raided the gambling school, and the chap they chased was one who got away. We returned to our own little game, played on till first post, then we had cocoa toast and jam for supper and retired to Bunk. 
Saturday 12th
This morning on parade, the heads enquired for information regarding the gambling schools, but of course no one knew anything about ?em.
