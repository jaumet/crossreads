of this terrible conflict. There were very few men in Civilian Clothes what there were were old Men. A large number of Women were standing in a long line with a small basket in front of them on the ground which contained Butter & Eggs, & people walked up & down the line making their purchases Agents from large Cities come & buy for their Firms & repack the butter & Eggs in large boxes & send them away by rail. Eggs are very dear 2/6 per dozen & Butter in Francs 20 Centimes for 1 Kilogramme which is a little over 2 lbs. Oranges were 5 C too dear. It was very amusing to see the way they handle the Rabbits, of course they are born in Captivity & they sit in open baskets & not a move out of them, they are handled by their owner & replaced again & they seem quite contented n their baskets. Fowls & ducks have their legs tied & are placed on the ground. Clothes are in some cases are laying on a canvas covering on the ground & dust & filth is blowing all over them, the owners don't seem to mind. They pay so much for the use of the grounds from 50 Cents
