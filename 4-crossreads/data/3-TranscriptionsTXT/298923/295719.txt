22 February 1918 FridayOn Outpost Jordan ValleyFive Taubes flew over, but did not bomb us, clouds too low-   Jacko kept his Field guns going last night but seems to have gone this morning-  The Infantry are now up & we withdraw towards Jerusalem -  The Turks cut the tendons of an Arab's hand, who would not fight against us-  we found him in JerichoCurlew were heard last night & this morning some Native companions flew over-  Did not see anything of Jacko's launches which were reported on the Dead Sea- the scenery all round is very grand & impressive-  I send you photo of the Cave Cell Monastery on the Mt of Temptation.
