<p>26.6.15<br/>Sat. 26th.  Had a pretty rough time last night on account of head-ache &amp; diarrhoea &amp; all day long I have been feeling only middlin'.  At 9.30 last night we had a rally to try &amp; draw the Turks fire, so as to find out where their machines guns were situated, but they would not bite.  The Turks landed a few shells on the hill opposite &amp; wounded a lad of the 2nd L.H., he was wounded through the leg.  They have been dropping shrapnel here &amp; on the beach all day.  The closest water available is about one mile away, so we get plenty of exercise, even if it is only getting water.  Have been feeling rather queer all the afternoon &amp; did nothing but lay down &amp; keep the flies off myself, which is a big order here.</p>
