<p>October 10th: -<br/>Went, after an early Breakfast to the Jewish quarter of the city where Petticoat Lane lies. The lane (by name) is a division of the East End, similar to the Haymarket at Sydney, and here, on Sunday, the Jewish community gathers to make purchases of meat, fish, vegetables, clothing or crockery, all of which goods are sold from barrows which line the narrow dirty streets.</p>
<p>On this Sunday, the crowd was tremendous and the noise deafening, for the hawkers shout lustily when proclaiming the qualities of their goods which are a heterogeneous collection of absolute rubbish. The ["Australiey boys"?] were loudly greeted on all sides, except by one merry Isaac who gave vent to his displeasure by shrieking every unkind phrase that he could think of, at us. Later we saw this chap being escorted by the police for behaving riotiously amongst the stalls of the excited Jews; so retribution overtook him quickly.</p>
<p>After dinner we went by bus to the beautiful Hampton Court where the most beautiful gardens are. The beds are glorious and the old Court or palace intensely interesting; in fact I enjoyed this place better than any which I had previously visited. Came back to Putney by car &amp; then caught the river steamer to Westminster.</p>
<p>After tea we went to service at the Abbey, the singing of the choiristers being enjoyable and pleasing.</p>
