 Since then I haven't done much but work.  Haven't had much leave.  Two evenings from 6 till 9.30 I spent the time having a bath &amp; feed.  Both very necessary as washing arrangements weren't too good.  Last Sunday I got off at 1 p.m., tore into Cairo, met Lon &amp; we had a great afternoon at the Citadel &amp; thereabouts.  Went all over the Mosque Mahomet Ali which is a glorious place.  Makes you feel quiet.  It is glorious. 
 Also went of Mosque Sultan Hassan which is very old &amp; is a wonderful place &amp; has some glorious copper &amp; gold work.  Also marks of cannon shot caused by Napoleon when he was thereabouts.  After dark we had tea at Groppis a great place, quite knocks out any tea place I've been to.  Then we went to Mrs. Smyths to dinner &amp; had some music.  She is very nice.
