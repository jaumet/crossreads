This is the first time they have played since the commencement of the war. Then I press forward &am; see the plenipotentiaries off & get into the different courts by assuming I have the right to go there & the soldiers let me go & finally return to town.
At night the town goes mad The Boulevards big as they are are impassable save at a snails paces. The crowd form processions & barge through one procession consists of a Union Jack & 2 Australian flags probably the most conspicuous procession in Paris Place de l'Opera is crowded & one of the opera singers sing to crowds ending up with Marseillaise & crowd dont join in the chorus. How unlike Australia & this in the highly temperamental nation of France.
Everywhere street dancing is in progress. Wild groups dance hand in hand - carry the girls shoulder high & do all that the thousand & one mad freaks that can be done in moments of excitement - at 3-30 pm I have to lay down as my heart is giving signs of knocking up.
I reach home about 7 am the following morning - tired & all that but still it is the only time that a peace like this will be signed in ones life & that one will be at Paris.
