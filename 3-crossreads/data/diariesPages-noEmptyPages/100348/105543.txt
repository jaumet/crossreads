Was taken as escort for prisoners from the Kass-el-Nil Barracks to Gizerch There were about a hundred of them. It makes a man sick to have to escort a fellow Australian between fixed bayonets down the street. Rather a heavy day for it must be 9 miles to Gizerch.

There was some very heavy rain last night, an unusual thing for Egypt. Most of the chaps got wet, because the straw roofs would not keep the water out. I managed to keep dry. Sept and I went to the Zoogicial Gardens. They are situated at Gizerch and are absolutely the prettiest I have ever seen. The footpaths are made like a mosiaic of pebbles; a marvel of beauty and patience.
