<p>And of a loving <strike>land</strike> friend<br/>From recollection ne'er will fade<br/>They are cherished to the end.</p>
<p>"My Countree, Australia"</p>
<p>Oh homeland the fairest<br/>And best land to me,<br/>What would I only give to be<br/>Once more again with thee<br/>Away across the ocean's boundless<br/>White tipped rolling foam<br/>To the land of lands<br/>Australia my beloved home</p>
<p>I seem to see in fancey<br/>The dear old home that I love<br/>in the trees the birds are singing<br/>As the sun shines bright above<br/>On the beach the surf is breaking<br/>And the wavelets dance with glee</p>
