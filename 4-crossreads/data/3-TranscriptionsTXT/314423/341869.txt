After some delay we were marched to the station more than a mile away, then another long wait and we were aboard a train and passed through St. Omer and Hazebrook. Here there was a long wait for the train to Pouileul which did not go until 5. We got out and had some fried eggs and bread. As a motor lorry was going to Baileul we got on board it and was in Baileul at 3.30. Later we caught another motor lorry in Baileul and was driven to within half a mile of Romarin &ndash; which place we heard the transports had recently shifted to. We arrived there before tea. There were 13 letters waiting for me when I arrived. 1 from my father, 1 from Gavin Johnson 2 from my sister,and 8 from my wife. It took me a long time to get through them all. 1 from Kitty Martin.
