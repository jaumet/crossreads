  
 chopped it down and made an "Anzacolite" out of it; but I think it has cured me too! Anyhow I am sending along the K.O.C. and a copy of what I sent them for you to judge and hope you wont think too badly of me. Remember I'm quite sound in mind again now! Am down at Port Said Rest camp and have been here just a week. The dentist has been fixing up my teeth and was to have had them done in time for next week's conscription, which is held on Tuesdays, but owing to him being ill the last few days my teeth wont be finished in time, so I may have to stay another week. Dont mind much if I do, because the Regt is not doing anything and this a grand place for a spell. Tons of tucker and a tonic three times a day to make you eat it. Does me!  I was very pleased to receive a six page letter from you the other day and hope you will keep repeating the dose. You had a great trip up round Maitland alright. I know some of that country too. Have been on that Greeta railway and went down the Standford Murther (I think it was) coal mine; but the big strike was on at the time and none of the mines were working. Glad to hear you are going in for chemistry
