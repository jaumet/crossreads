In Flanders Fields
In Flanders fields the poppies growBetween the crosses, row on rowThat mark our place:  and in the skyThe larks still bravely singing, flyScarce heard amid the guns below.
We are the Dead.  Short days agoWe lived, felt Dawn, saw Sunset glow,Loved, and were loved, and now we lieIn Flanders fields.
Take up our quarrel with the foe:To you from failing hands we throwThe torch:  be yours to hold it high:If ye break faith with us who dieWe shall not sleep, though poppies growIn Flanders fields.
John McCrae.
