<p>in any case said the man. No' said the Sentry that is not playing the game Put it through him yourself. The man started eagerly forward to do so, but then stopped &amp; said I suppose it is hardly right, I could put it through a live Hun, but not a "dead 'un".</p>
<p>The other Hun was seen to have "a parcel from Berlin" in his hand. It certainly would not stay there long when the trench was manned.</p>
<p>All the other Shelters further down the trench had been "cleaned" out by the Huns, having had more time to do so that those on the left flank.</p>
<p>To most of the men, who thought at all, it was quite a mystery how a single man had been able to get up to that trench in the charge considering the fire that they had been subjected to, but they were much more mystified when the trench was "discovered" to be so well protected with barbed wire, but their astonishment was increased twofold when an examination showed that the Huns had had Machine guns placed in that trench every ten yards, (or thereabouts) apart.</p>
<p>There could be no disputing this for the bases of three of these Machine Guns had been left behind by the Huns in their wild, mad, rush to get away, &amp; going lower down the trench the Machine gun positions and piles of empty shells showed plainly where the other Machine Guns had been working &amp; in one case a whole belt of shells, the belt being 20 feet long but doubled in two. These Machine guns being further away from where the attack "first fell", had been removed intact.</p>
<p>Even when looked at calmly &amp; cooly from the top of the trench the barbed wire looked terrible, &amp; without any fire at all, Straggers who were occasionally coming up to it, could not possibly cross it even</p>
