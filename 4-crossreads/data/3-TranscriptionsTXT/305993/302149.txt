28.12.188 a.m.  Fog still prevailed & we could not see beyond a few hundred yards so it was too much of a risk to run & try & pick up the bouy which the British torpedoe boats had laid to mark the narrow channel of 400 yards wide for a distance of 11 miles.  At 2 p.m. the fog cleared & we sighted two British mine sweepers a distance of 1 mile away, they being on their way to Varna to clear the minefield & like us having anchored until clear weather.  At 2.30 p.m. we hove up & proceeded to Varna picking up the small marks laid down in the shape of bouys, passing within a few hundred yards of the rocks laying near the land.   We proceeded to the harbor & made fast at the wharf at 4.30 p.m.  Hundreds were down of the Civilian & Military population of Varna.  We found out after that we were the first British troopship there since the war began.
