<p>Friday 12 May 1916<br/>A beautifully fine day following a dull grey morning. At 9 o'c there was a battalion parade at which the sentence of the Court Martial on my man (O'Hea) was read out, viz. 6 mths. hard labour. Then came a company parade &amp; in the afternoon inspection of the draft of men to go onto the front. Was paraded &amp; told by the Div. Adj. that I should be reqd to accompany the party as 2nd in command. Visited the dentist to try &amp; get my tooth finished, but without success.</p>
