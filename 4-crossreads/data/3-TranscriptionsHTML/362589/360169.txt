<p>Luna Park Hospital<br/>Heliopolis<br/>10th Oct. 1915</p>
<p>Dear Mr Ferguson,<br/>Thank you very much for your welcome letter which I received two days ago &ndash; It was very good of you to think of me as I thought you had probably forgotten all about me by now. I am in hospital as you can see by the above address suffering from a bad attack of dysentery but am thankful to say that I am feeling much better now. I had bad luck over in Gallipoli to fall sick like I did as I enjoyed the life over there very much. I was only over there about a month &amp; in the firing line all the time but was lucky enough to escape getting hit. I received a letter from Matron some weeks ago so I ought to hear from her again any day now. I hope to be back in the trenches in about 6 weeks all being well. Please remember me to Mr Curtis I do not know his address or I would drop him a line. Must close now with kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy, and yourself. Yours very sincerely Colin. S. Wells.</p>
