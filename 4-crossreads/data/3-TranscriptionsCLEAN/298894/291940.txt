would speak of incidents at the front & he would cry most pitifully when the spoke of two young boys who were blown to pieces by a shell.   He described how he found one leg only & buried it.   He then sang the hymn "O God our help in ages past" & cried out "God be with us, but I am afraid he is not with me" & so on.
Saturday 26th
Had another mile swim out to a ship felt much stronger in the water.   At night had one bad case, a young fellow took a fit & was delirious for hours.   His was a particularly sad case being the last of a family.  He had three brothers drowned in a Submarine  a fourthhis father went down in a Cruiser & his mother died from shock, truly enough to turn any mans mind.   Had a look at the Greek church again & on giving 3d the priest lit two candles for us.   I wonder what effect it had on my sins.
Sunday 27th
Once again our moving day.   At 3.30 P.M. orders came for 50 of us to proceed at once to Cape Helles for duty.  Here was our chance at last.    Overjoyed And in my own case as well, serious thought, we packed up & proceeded by pinnace to the "Arragon" the headquarters ship.    Here I looked up my friend Andrews who instantly prepared me a good tea & entertained me with some news.  At 8 P.M. we embarked on the "Hythe" a sweeper & sailed shortly after for Cape Helles.
