 saw that we did it purpos . He inspect us and spoke to some of the chap . The whole thing was done splendid , the best of it kind I have ever seen . Our fellow can drill better than the " Guard " when they like . Left Albert in motor lorri and join the Battalion in camp at Englebelm . Had to make a bivouac. 30/6/17 . Open countri round here , take advantag of it by do in field manouv . Went to a Brigad parad , where Billi Holman the Politit came to inspect us . Birdwood was there also . I wish these damn polit jonni would keep away , they are not satisfi with " Joy Ride " round at their countri 's expens , but must have the troop march and counter march for their edif .
