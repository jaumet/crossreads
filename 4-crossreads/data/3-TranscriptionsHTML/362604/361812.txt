<p>Dear Dad, Mother &amp; George,</p>
<p>I am on Duty to-night until 10 p.m. so I trying to settle down.  You speak about Dave not turning up.  You know that when I get Home I will not feel inclined to run about all over the country.  I have kept up a continuous correspondence with about 40 different people between Inverell &amp; Goulburn.  They will all want me to visit them.  I'll have to turn lots down, but of course I'll not tell them that I'm coming &amp; then fail to turn up.</p>
