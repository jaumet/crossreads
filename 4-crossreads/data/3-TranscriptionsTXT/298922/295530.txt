 Wednesday 8 August 1917 
 Alexandria. Arrived 1.30 p.m. or 13.30 as we write it &ndash; sent to No. 10 Convalescent Hospital, a fine building taken over from a HUN, cotton Merchant facing the sea, in nice grounds. Here I expect to stay one week then back to Palestine. 
 Am feeling fitter but very slack. 
 A mixture of Tommy Officers &amp; Australians are here, they do not always blend well. But Scotties &amp; Colonials do -  it is the younger English pups speak so disparagingly of our folk &ndash; However!!!  A lot of them bring it on themselves.
