<p>12 April, 1916 Wednesday</p>
<p>88 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Revielle as usual.</p>
<p>Just the same old routine, nothing new only that we probably may stay in this hell for another 3 months &amp; shelters for both men &amp; horses &amp; they are to be erected straight away, so all signs of a move is misfish.</p>
<p>The [indecipherable] service is to be broken up today &amp; each regt on the new basis is issued with 4 waggons which are permanently attached &amp; men also the Bde train does not now exist, the Div supplies all that, the late drivers of our train have been left in the mud &amp; now are transferring to the artillery &amp; engineers. Glasgow is also finding positions for them, he is still in Heliopolis; Cyril Tonkins fell down two flights of stairs yesterday when visiting friends &amp; broke his leg in two places, he's always in for any bad luck that's running.</p>
<p>Expect mail tomorrow. Bed 10.10</p>
