 Monday Today a slight thaw set in but it began to snow again. I went to Houplines this morning.  A lad came in this afternoon for a chat & tonight Jenkin one of our Vic. probationers also dropped in. 
 Tuesday The weather was a little milder today but cold enough, the ground has become quite muddy, but tonight I noticed before dark that the water in the streets was coating with ice.  I have been down to the trenches today & had lunch with Capt. Connell & called also at the Canteen. 
 Wednesday Went to Trenches & canteen today.  Bible Class tonight, 18 present, parable Lost Sheep, Lost Coin.
