swearing in the way that a gentleman shouldn't because he couldn't find out anything about the fight that he was supposed to be running.  His staff were discretly keeping out of the way & waiting for something to turn up.  There was a bit of a whirr overhead, & a pigeon hopped into the dovecote.  News at last!  The message was opened in silence & on it as scrawled in indelible pencil "I'm [blank] well fed up with carrying this [blank] bird."
We had a fine time in London, & the ten days went like the wind.  We saw over a big  munition factory that I can't tell you anything about, went to church once at St. Pauls & to the theatre every night, saw over the Museums, or some of them, with Miss Miles, who knows them like the palm of her hand, & had a jolly good time generally.
What do you mean by rushing about to places chock-full of earthquakes & things of that sort?  Take my advice & keep well away from them.
Your loving SonK. Ferguson
