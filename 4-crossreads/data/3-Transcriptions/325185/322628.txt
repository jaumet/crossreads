<p>Dear Father<br/>Would have written you sooner but have been going to come in each night. Was coming last night but we had a funeral in our company so had to attend that.Then Aunty Lily wrote to say she was coming out to see me. As it happened we dident get back until about five o'clock. Aunty &amp; Rita &amp; some other girl came. It was too late to show them around the camp. Aunty brought me a box of cake. Won't care to go back to Jam again when it is finished. They caught the half past five back again. I asked Aunty to come out one night &amp; go to one of our concerts. She said she would come. Well Father I am putting in for leave on <strike>Saturday</strike> Friday for sat &amp; sunday dont know how I will get on. If they won't give it to me well I am just going to take more leave than I have</p>
