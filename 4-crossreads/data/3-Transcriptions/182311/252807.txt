<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably this is the last long letter that I will write from the above address, for we&#39;ve packed again and hope to leave within the next few days, in fact on Wednesday next we expect to be off.&nbsp; Since my return from London I&#39;ve had a busy time, a day and a half at a &quot;Gas School&quot; where I passed (in my Helmet) ten minutes in poison gas ten times stronger than that which we will go through at the Front, the experience was one to give a fellow confidence in his helmet, for no ill-effects were noticeable; then in special goggles into tear gas which could be breathed with safety and smells extremely pleasant.&nbsp; With the goggles on no effects were noticeable, but sixty seconds after removing the goggles, with streaming eyes and for the time quite blinded I was feeling my way to the door.&nbsp; Both these experiments give one confidence in the efficiency of our helmets and goggles.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The following day I took a small party of Infantry on a six mile march out to the Bustard Trenches where the Engineers were engaged in consolidating a crater about thirty feet wide and twenty feet deep caused by exploding a mine of 5,000 blocks of guncotton.&nbsp; When theEngineers had taken over my men, Lieut Teague of the Melbourne Engineering firm, Purchas &amp; Teague, showed me the whole work and explained it; it was a fine lesson and I then passed it on</p>
