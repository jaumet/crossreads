<p>of discharging any of the men until they had thoroughly recuperated. He was particularly kind to me and although I was up and really recovered completely, although a bit thin, he insisted on procuring for me all the extras there were in the way of special dishes &amp;c. consequently I picked up in no time and am now feeling fitter than I have for a long while.</p>
<p>Since this is the first time I have ever paraded sick or been off duty for a day, a record held by very few, I thought I might as well make the most of it and consequently have been in no hurry to rejoin my unit. There are dozens of men from our battalion here as well as a large number from the other brigades.<br/> Our division has been kept in the trenches for a longer period than ever before and under more trying conditions and I think it is as a kind of protest that the doctors have been sending numbers of men with only slight complaints into hospital.<br/> Many of those here have very little indeed really wrong with them, being only somewhat run down. It is amusing to see some of them "swinging the lead" as we term it. That is shamming complaints when they are really well in order to stay in hospital for a while longer.<br/> When the time comes for taking the temperatures, too, all the comparatively well, vie with each other in endeavouring to raise their temperatures above the normal, and the man who succeeds in doing so even if only by a few points is looked upon with envy as he is sure to be left in for a few more days.<br/>Anyhow I feel I have rested quite long enough and am to return to my unit to-morrow.<br/>I must close now in order to catch the mail.<br/>With best of love to all at home &amp; next door<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Eugene.</p>
