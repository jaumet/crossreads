 ever , while the light last , through all their swift chang suffus with the crimson fire of the day , die in the midst of chao and disord . Now that the day has gone , and dark has set in , the night is full of a fierc unrest , tumultu wild spirit ride in the gale , wrestl with the gnarl branch of the ancient vener oliv tree , tear their leav off in hand , and cast them spite among the stone grappl in a wild unruli anger with the stone ancient rock wall that withstand them , and shriek their way through the hill to that bare and desol region where sure on such a night as this , the Spirit of all the Great Armi of lost Soul might congreg and hold riotous carniv togeth , the region of the Dead Sea . Devil that stir men to deed of oppress and violenc , fiend that sow in men 's heart , the lust of pride and power that lead to war and bloodsh , sweep fierc and exult by on the wing of the gale to the tryst place hold hold high carniv over the bone of the pile up dead , and count those who shall fall on red field to-morrow and howl through the barren hill , in cruel deris over those who are out wound to-night , expos to their furi and power . A wild , wild night , typic of the War Spirit that hold the world in it grip , wring it to an agoni of blood and tear that know no stay . Ride on in your chariot of wind and storm and tumult ye evil spirit and rejoic for this is your hour , and the storm of dark . And yet mayhap the world that tomorrow 's sun will rise on [indecipher ] better for thi pass , a world cleans and purifi by the veri furi of thi pass . And so , we rememb no good and perfect thing can come to us without sorrow , and tear , and pain . The Gift of the Princ of Peac made three hill echo to the lament of Rachael , mourn for her children and refus to be comfort , becaus of the Innocent who were slain . Yet the piti tragedi of infant massacr and the woe of sorrow motherhood usher in a new era of peac and good will to man . And so the anguish Rachael of this our day , the sorrow motherhood of the world , walk their mourn way with dim eye , and bow heart and head , shall sure also see this dark night wild night of fierc unbridl passion pass , and in the clean , sweet dawn of saniti and restraint which must soon come , a new and better world shall appear , purifi and ennobl by the blood of their martyr boy .
