 Dearest old Mrs, I have written a long letter to you but have not yet addressed it.   I am waiting till I get a reply to my cable which I will send to you when I get ashore.   I want to find out whether you are on the Demosthenes or not & if you are, what port the letter will catch you at.   I am addressing this letter to several ports in the hope of its getting you somewhere.   It is only to let you know that I am quite well as also is Fred.  I felt very sad yesterday (Xmas day) being away from you all.   We have had a very pleasant voyage so far - yesterday was such a nice cool day.   With best love to the Kiddies Trix & your own sweet self remembrances to Amy & hoping you are all quite well Yr loving old man Will. No news yet of our destination
