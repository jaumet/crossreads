Did not go out at all until about 10 and then visited the Transport and QMs Department. The Boche downed one of our balloons and the occupants had to parachute down. Went to 21st BnH.Q. and had a yarn there. At 3p.m. rode over to C D Coy and had a conference with all the officers over there. We then went back to BnH.Q. and messed. At 7.15 into the saddle once more and madefor A B Coys where we spent more time in conference mainly about statistics and fact: Our strength is coming down very much and we are now the weakest battalion in the Bde. The 24th were hitherto but their Ploegsteert gas cases are now returning. Everyone has wind up about prospective breaking up of divisions batts etc.
