machines, after all I had heard read about them, they are a most peculiar shape something like an egg only the angles are more acute, something after this style the little strokes are where the machine guns or 6 lbs are placed, the whole concern likes lies flat on the ground is moved along caterpillar fashion for it is almost covered with an endless chain of grips these are driven by motors inside the machine, they are ponderous affairs nothing but a direct hit from a shell would stop them for they are all steel, a proper land "Dreadnought" inside one of them was the charred remains of 2 men, it looked to me as if the shell had set the petrol tank alight they had been burnt to death, from a distance a "Tank" looks somewhat like a threshing machine with the wheels off. We passed any amount of dead men on the way up both ours German, these were all killed in the last charge when Flers was taken
