We were escorted for 30 miles from the entrance by extra Hydroplanes Monotors towing balloons & motor boat chasers our escort being 3 Japanese destroyers & an Australian destroyer the H.M.A.S. Swan, also British destroyer Nymph.  At 11 a.m. we passed a Hydroplane in distress in the Water with the observer & Pilot waving a distance of 500 yards from us.  So we sent signals to the H.M.A. destroyer Swan.  She went over & lowered a boat & picked the two survivors up much (exhusted) exhausted having been out spotting submarines the day before & had to come down on the water on account of engine trouble.  They were two Australians & sea plane also being Australian.  So the Swan semaphored to us at 11.20 a.m. & the two survivors were in a very poor way.  Our Naval Captain on board is much disappointed at our speed, that is having to go so slow on account of the slower ships.  The Canberra at noon today suddenly stopped her engines through some defect & we had to stop our transports engines to avoid collision.  Mod. breeze prevails fine & clear.  All the native crew are served out with metal disc & numbered also our troops have to wear lifebelts & crew continuously.  We are bound for Salonika, Greese.
