<p>to walk down one of London&#39;s streets, with names that we have always known to ride on a modern Bus, past Westminster Abbey, to feed the pigeons of St. Pauls, to look at Big Ben but not hear him for bells would be a sure guide to Zeppelins, the Tower of London, the Tower Bridge, &amp; old Father Thames, slipping quietly under the piers carring his soiled waters out to <sub>^</sub><sup>be</sup> cleansed in the ocean.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I walked in the Mall &amp; saw the Grenadier Guards parade &amp; relieve the Royal Guard passed Whitehall &amp; opposite stood the Horse Guards with their Guard, two mounted men &amp; one on foot, standing horses &amp; men stiffly as marble but coloured most gorgeously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hyde Park, Marlborough House, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Somerset House, Scotland Yard, <s>The Bank of England</s> The Inns of Court, Old Bailey &amp; may another famous place was passed sometimes rapidly on top of a bus &amp; sometimes more minutely, making as careful an inspection as time would allow.</p>
