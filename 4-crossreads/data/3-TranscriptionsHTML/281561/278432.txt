<p>21/9/17.<br/>Working with the school. We went with targets to a rifle range, for a shootng test.  A chap beat me by a point for first place. The work is solid here nearly 8 hours a day.<br/>24/9/17.<br/>The school was moved today. Went about 9 kilos past Steenvoorde to billet in a farm. We are only a few hundred yards from the frontier. Heard the 3rd Divison was about, went into Steenvoorde looking for Bob. He was not around. If I had got a fair go I would have been with the school a fortnight ago.<br/>26/9/17.<br/>Left for billet yesterday and made a new camp in a field. Carried on with the training today. There are no new stunts and I am wise to all the old ones.</p>
