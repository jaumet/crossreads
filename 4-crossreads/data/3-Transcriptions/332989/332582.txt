<p>Somewhere in France</p>
<p>My Darling Mother<br/>We are still on the winning side &amp; where, not holding our own are going forward a little.   Have been in the trenches for some time but at present are back from the firing line for a rest,   While we were in the firing line things were fairly active and Fritz was caused much annoyance.   Our casualties were pretty heavy, but, I think there were considerably more among the ranks</p>
