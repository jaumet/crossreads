<p>88 wks from home</p>
<p>Further news of the air raid came to hand yesterday night, they bombed 3 aeroplane hangers, 2 of which had each 3 planes in &amp; 1 had two, they dropped in all 100 bombs of various sizes &amp; made splendid work, we lost one plane, it fell into the sea but later both plane &amp; occupants were rescued by the navy. It is said now that it is impossible for the Taubes to establish a base (aeroplane) within 100 mls of the canal as they lay themselves too open for attack from our people. Left Ismailia for Romani today at 10, &amp; eventually arrived home at 9.30 to find parcels &amp; letters awaiting me.  Amar has been relieved &amp; sent back to his unit for inefficiency.</p>

Horses are falling off in condition on account of the water.</p>
