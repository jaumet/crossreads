On May 11th we were attached to the Australian [Indecipherable] Division &amp; for a time the rations were most unsatisfactory, &amp; during this period our men were doing a lot of road making in a dirty, dusty camp, &amp; in consequence septic sores increased suddenly. Fortunately rations improved &amp; on May 22nd we went up to Ain Duk &amp; took over a section of the front line &amp; with water handy &amp; a clean camp things greatly improved, we were very free from sickness here, Unfortunately as it turned out later our Hdqrs which were nearest the water suffered most, the transport next &amp; then the C.B.A. Squadron in order, from the ravages of Malaria. We then moved back to Solomon's Pools, travelling by night in two stages &amp; had a very wild trip &amp; on arriving at Solomon's Pools Malaria began to develop, &amp; from that time onwards we had a lot of it, &amp; it always developed with any sudden change of weather. We then moved back to the valley &amp; had a certain amount of Malaria.
