<p>Friday May 4th<br/>A lovely day. Reveille goes at 6.30 am &amp; we have to be out &amp; everything straight by 7 am. Went through medical board &amp; classed as B.1.B.A.C, that is under observation with physical drill, also went through, dental scan, &amp; kit inspection. Put into different hut this afternoon, according to our classification.</p>
<p>Saturday May 5th<br/>Started on the physical drill today, &amp; my word it hurt too, as I haven't done any drill for about 10 months. Re-examined by the Colonel today &amp; classed as B1 A2, that is I am getting better. Today is a real summers day. The Camp is <strike>right up</strike> on top of a big hill overlooking the sea, &amp; about 3 miles out of Weymouth.</p>
<p>Sunday May 6th<br/>Very cold wind blowing. It was a very cold night last night. It is very poor food here, a fellow feels hungry the whole day, &amp; what we do get isnt cooked right. The food is spoilt by the cooks. Went for a walk to the harbour this afternoon.</p>
<p>Monday May 7th<br/>A lovely day. <strike>Was</strike> Received second issue of clothing today, issued with a good few articles not needed, apparently the military is not short of clothing. Fell in 2.30 pm &amp; was marched to Westham, a distance of about 2 miles. It is nearly in Weymouth. The huts are much smaller at Westham. Had our kit bags carried. Very tired upon arrival here.</p>
