<p>Flanders 17-10-17<br/>Dear Mother and Father<br/>I am in the delightful position of having written to everyone whom I can think of. We are all quite alright.</p>
<p>I remember Sgt. McMurtrie quite well. He was quite a good man &ndash; He must have been pretty sick. He has been away for some time.</p>
<p>I think I have answered all your letters now.</p>
<p>The weather is quite decent again. Saw a ripping sight this morning. A Bosche aeroplane shot down by one of ours from about 10,000 feet. He did come down nicely with our fellow sporting round and swanking after him.</p>
<p>Best love<br/>Your affectionate son<br/>C.R.Lucas</p>
