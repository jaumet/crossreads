little further I passed a large number of our Brave Lad's Graves, you can see the white crosses standing out plain in the Moonlight, After leaving the Cemetery one comes into very open Country, hardly a tree is left standing or a Farm House, everything above ground has been blown to pieces, I passed several lines of our old trenches also Trenches Fritz had occupied prior to the July 31st when we first shifted him. The country about is fairly flat. After a few more minutes I steamed through the Yard called St Jean, The village being away in the distance, this place will be I presume another Railway Depot bye bye. We continued going all being well ahead for about a mile or so when we came to H3 Gun Spir which run alongside of the Main for about 2 chain, we stopped the truck opposite the big Gun the Gunners started unloading the shells, As we gradually approached this Siding, things started to liven up very much
