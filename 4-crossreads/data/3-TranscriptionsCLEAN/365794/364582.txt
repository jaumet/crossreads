  
 Saturday 29th June 1917 [1918] 1/2 day & Cpl. Shaw & I go to Embabah & take snaps and the village is most interesting with its tiny doorways with crowds of children, sheep or donkeys standing around, filth on every side and the canal from the Nile flowing quietly by with boats with sails set on their way down or up, to Luxor.
