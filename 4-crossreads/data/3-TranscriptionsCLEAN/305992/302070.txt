These troops have been out 3 1/2 years at the Dardanelles, Western front, Salonika & Mesepotamia & now down from 50 miles north of Bagdad & going to Suez & Alexandria thence to Salonika to relieve the white troops there. They are a fine specimen of Indian troops composed of all castes & creeds. They have their own noncommissioned officers, Lieut. Captains & under the supervision of British officers. They all do their own cooking, special fire old fashioned grates fixed on deck for their convenience & live on curry & rice pancakes & water. 2 meals a day. Rum issued out to them twice a day in very small quantities. They are very clean in their habits & have very peculiar ways re. cooking as a white man must not handle their food.
