<p>The Germans have launched there offensive on a 50 mile front from the [Indecipherable] to the Oise. "The attack is on a larger scale than any other that has been made at any stage of the war on any part of the front". Some of our outposts have been withdrawn, but the attack has failed in its objectives.</p>
<p>We are staying at Wardrecques for the night awaiting orders. Some of the transport went for a swim in the canal. There are many rumours of a big reverse in the area of the enemy attack.</p>
<p>The Colonel came around and said we were too heavily loaded so we dumped a lot of extra clothes, blankets &amp; other things we were carrying. They will go into salvage. I put in an overcoat, tunic &amp; sheepskin jacket &amp; gloves.</p>
<p>Monday March 25. 1918. 1330<br/>Cold &amp; cloudy all day.</p>
<p>We will be here all day also the Battalion &amp; will move sometime tonight to the railway station at St Omer and then travel south to the scene of the big enemy push.</p>
<p>All sorts of wild rumours are afloat but it is certain that the British have met</p>
