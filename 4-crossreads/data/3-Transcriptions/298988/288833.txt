<p>stones being very large.  There are eight pyramids altogether, three right together (these are the biggest) &amp; five a few miles further away.

Leaving the pyramids we motored in to the Railway Station, arriving just in time to catch the 6.30 train for Alexandria.  We went right to the dining car &amp; proceeded to have dinner &amp; it was <strike>a</strike> well got up too, a very nice dining car &amp; a meal of 8 courses, you buy whatever wines or ales you wish.  Smoking &amp; eating we spent 3&frac12; hours to arrival in there.  The scenery along the line was grand, being all irrigated from the Nile, Natives working in the fields &amp; bullocks pulling the water from the river, this latter is also done by the Natives themselves, by dipping a goat skin bucket on the end of a pole into the water &amp; swinging it round into a small dam from which it flows, through small channels over the land.</p>
<p>March 17th<br/>Visited Pompeys Pillar at Alexandria today.  This is a huge spiral structure erected by Alexander the Great to commemorate his conquest of Egypt.  Underneath there are tombs cut out of the rock &amp; there used to be a tunnel running from it a distance of two miles under the River Nile, but part of it has now fallen in.</p>
