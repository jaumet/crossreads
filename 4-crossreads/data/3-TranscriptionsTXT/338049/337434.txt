Monday 12 AugustFine day.
Busy in office in morning then line to 10th Bde out again. Long tramp to big valley, found 3/4 miles cut out. Reeled up line round a big bend, took a short cut and restored the break. Wrong lines jointed - so swapped over.
Home about 5 p.m. Had dinner after bit of trouble. Fixed up lines, attended to office business until late.
Moving out tomorrow.
