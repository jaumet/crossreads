<p>Red Cross letterhead<br/>5.  All the garden flowers are in bloom &amp;  the peony's &amp; iris &amp; roses are in full bloom.  It is just glorious weather now, &amp; to walk anywhere the lovely scent from flowers &amp; trees is just wonderful.  The scent is never out of one's&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nostrils, even if a tree or garden is not in sight the lovely sweet scent follows one.  It is very hot of course &amp; on Sunday 6 of us went for a swim in the Avon at Bulford.  There were 100's in the water but by Jingo it was cold for the first 2 minutes.  We only stayed in for about 5 minutes.  I have not been to Church for about 3 weeks but I am always in good Company, so don't think</p>
