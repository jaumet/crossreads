<p>9 Monday<br/>Word was received this morning that the G.O.C. &amp; a couple  more heads were going to visit here, but they never turned up, so we had all our extra cleaning up for nix.  Went into Reninghelst on the back of Pte Beauchamps (Despatch rider) motor bike, had a real good bath at the divisional bath, bought a few things &amp; walked out to Ouderdom, talking to Le Clerk &amp; came back to Dickebusch by the horse Waggon.</p>
<p>10 Tuesday<br/>Done gas picket from 12.30 am till 3.30 am  I done the middle shift on account of Fred Moore wanting to go to Reninghelst early in the morning.  Owing to the water we have here being pronounced "not fit for human consumption" we have to carry water about a mile.  It is a beautiful moonlight night.  Went out to Voormezeele in the ambulance wagon to have a look about.</p>
<p>11 Wednesday<br/>everything out here is in heaps of ruins.  Saw the place where the Canadian was supposed to have been crucified, &amp; the Nunnery where the nuns were maltreated by the Germans.  Voormezele is about 800 yds behind the firing line.  Things have been very quiet for the last couple of days, bar a naval bombardment, we can just hear it here.  We received the news here this evening that <strike>four</strike> three of us have to go to Bedford House &amp; one to Ouderdom.  Received a letter from Mrs Nelson.</p>
