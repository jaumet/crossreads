  
 20 I was pleased to receive a letter from you written in Jany and another written in March. 
 Today I had another pleasure in receiving a letter of yours written in April.  In this there was a note from Esme and one from Sheila. 
 No letters from dear mother. 
 I know she has written but changed have put my mail all wrong. 
 You are anxious for me to get on I know but in the Army one must first take what comes, progress is slow. 
 I am with a fine lot of men and officers. 
 Have been too tired to write much lately
