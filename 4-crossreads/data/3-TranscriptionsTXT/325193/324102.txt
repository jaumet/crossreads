June 7th 1917.We have been awakened at 2 A.M. and told that we advance at 3.  after gitting a few odds and ends together that we take with us in our pack not very many I can tell you.  At five minutes to 3 we get orders to stand by our guns and to open up just at the tick of 3.  I have never experienced anything like it in my life and I hope I never do again.  Well (Macines) is about a hill
