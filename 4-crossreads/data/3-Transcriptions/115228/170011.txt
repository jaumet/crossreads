<p>Artillery action today so far as our Brigade was concerned. Beautiful orchards, especially oranges around Duran. Outpost at night outside the town.</p>
<p><u>Nov 15th</u> :- Advanced another eight miles today through the large native towns of Ramleh &amp; Ludd. Our Regt. performed a splendid feat today, about 80 men from &quot;A&quot; &amp; &quot;B&quot; Sqdns. surrounding &amp; capturing 300 Turks with 4 machine guns. We had hardly any casualties, the Turks seemed absolutely tired</p>
