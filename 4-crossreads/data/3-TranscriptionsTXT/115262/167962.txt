 Saturday 14 July 1917. 
 Early morning parade as usual &amp; as on every other Saturday morning we struck our tents at 5 a.m. to give to tent space an airing. Mess orderly today with &quot;Nat&quot; and then at 9 a.m. fell in for swimming parade to Bitter Lakes. Saw several native women. They are rather good looking and that&#39;s all. 
 Hospital boat &quot;Niagra&quot; &amp; a Br Cruiser in the Canal (Suez) 
 On return pitched tents. (This was  good  in the midday sun too.). 
 Wrote a letter later. 
 Sun 15th&nbsp;We visited the Spanish, Greek, French &amp; European quarters and were pleased to see some people who reminded us of home.
