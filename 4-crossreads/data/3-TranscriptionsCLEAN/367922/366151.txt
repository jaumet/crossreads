 Dear Arthur, It will save me some trouble, if you book me at central office to-morrow. I shall do the coaching business. 
 Perhaps the accommodation will devise between Murga and Eugowra: you will see both, and devise; and will not be too much allured either by the hotel fittings or natural advantages of scenery of either. 
 Yours truly A.McManamey.
