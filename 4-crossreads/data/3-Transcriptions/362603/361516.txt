<p>2.  has to pay at the same rate as we or anyone else.  I read in one of Your Papers that someone is running down the Pommy soldier.  How many Australians do You think You could raise on 1/- a day, &amp; only allowed to draw half of that every pay day.  And yet lots of our Boys look down on them &amp; say they have no spirit.  If a Tommy speaks out of turn He is likely to get shot. &amp; yet it is said "We English are a free People."  Be good to Tommies is my motto.  Why, what have the English People done for us over here.  I have 3 Homes in England for the rest of my Days if I wished.  No Colonial Soldier has ever been treated other than as a long lost Son.  Of course many Girls &amp; young wives have been ruined.  They blame the women.  It is the men who are to blame.  The English Girls are so True &amp; so Patriotic, so anxious to be Kind &amp; nice to the Colonials, &amp; others who are lonely that they are in many cases carried away by their feelings, &amp; these dirty Mongrels take advantage of those who have been so Kind &amp; good, &amp; of course start them on the way to the Devil.  I'll never blame women again.  If they were all so bad why have I not fallen.  I am human &amp; very fond of the Fair-Sex.  I rarely meet any &amp; never seek their Company, because I am not strong enough to make a Friend for a week, &amp; then drop that one again.  I have made 2 Friends in Salisbury.  I will leave them with much sorrow &amp; I will never see them again.  I hate to think of it.  They have been so</p>
