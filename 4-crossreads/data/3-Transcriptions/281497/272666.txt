<p>4th  A lot of details came in last night from England, some of them have been malingering there for 15 months &amp; more, &amp; must have been absolutely kicked out: or they would have never stirred</p>
<p>This morning the whole company were instructed how to load &amp; work a Lewis gun, a fine &amp; most necessary thing I reckon for it often happens that the whole crew of them get knocked out &amp; if you are in a tight corner they are just the thing, &amp; they are so light &amp; handy, they fire 47 shots in 5 secs so they are pretty fast while they were instructing us a shot was accidently fired</p>
