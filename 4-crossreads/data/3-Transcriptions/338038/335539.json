<p>record and in remembrance of a son who was to me very dear to us I am desirous that the information in it may be correct &ndash; Perhaps you will pardon me for writing to you and accept as my reason the wish of a father very advanced in years to make the "In Memoriam" of a lost son as complete as the cause deserves &ndash;<br/>Yours obediently<br/>WNG</p>
