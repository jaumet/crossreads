<p>10/3/16<br/>Carried on the musketry today. This evening we were ordered to prepare our packs for our punishment drill. The company fell in with full marching order, at 5 PM. and demanded a inquiry. The adjutant rushed out and read the Riot Act, every man stood firm and demanded individually to be paraded before the Colonel. Was promised that we could see him tomorrow. Did an hour's drill. Then was dismissed.<br/>11/3/16.<br/>Saw the Colonel and the punishment was wiped out. Our company was detailed for inlying Picquet instead; so we don't score much except that we brought the adjutant a crash. Sept came over to have a yarn.</p>
