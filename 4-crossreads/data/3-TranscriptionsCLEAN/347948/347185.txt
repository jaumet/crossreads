And bravely though our boys did toil to nobly win the dayThe odds were with the dreadnoughts of the foeThey little knew that retribution hurried on the wayTill part of Britain's first line let them know
They came and joined our cruisers and commenced to pour in shellsAnd at once the Germans doubled back for KeilThey could hold their own with cruisers & the children of the fleetBut the fury of our first line made them reel
They blew the Huns to pieces as they fled towards their homeAnd 18 ships were sunk beneath the waveThey won't come out again to try conclusions on the seaThe perils of our battleships to brave
So once again old England's proved "Brittania rules the waves"And let the Germans try as best they canThey'll find Brittania's might is opposed to German spiteAnd as able to defeat her on the land
