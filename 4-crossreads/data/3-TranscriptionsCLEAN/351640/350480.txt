turkey?  Who clapped for grace?  Who ladeled out the soup?  Who carved?  Did the plum-pudding blaze up satisfactorily?  Who cut it up?  Who found the money pieces? Did the nut crackers work satisfactorily?  Was the fruit of good quality?  What of the olives?  What of the cheese straws or other savoury?  Was it lemonade or ginger ale or Nan's delight or Moroneys tonic that slaked the thirst adding moisture to the solids?  My hope is that good digestions waited upon full appetites.  By the way, did any presents arrive on Christmas morning?  You always, in recent years, said that I was father Christmas - Pere le Noel - if so then, during my absence, he could hardly be with you.  Let me hope however that a substitute, if your ideas of former years were correct, was found for me.  Hurrah!  Hurrah!!!  Hurrah!!!!!
Have you seen friend Jimmy Roach lately?  Should you do so, please give to him my kind regards.
11-45 a.m.  Having read for the Catholics the Mass prayers from M.M. Joseph's Missal, as taught to me by My Kafoline, I walked along the deck.  Nurses were opening various boxes, one of these was familiar in shape & size, I remarked - "If I were at home this morning one of my best girls would have offered me a block out of a box like that."  She at once said - "Please have one?"  I complied and said - "Your name?  Well I shall write at once to my best girls telling them that Sister Deere of South Australia gave me a block of chocolate sponge".  All the nurses belonging to the Army Corps are Sisters.  Then another nurse offered a chocolate out of her box.  I said - "Please pick out for me a hard one?" - She did so.  Then I said - "To my best girls shall I also report that Nurse Haynes of S. Australia chose for me a hard chocolate from her box."
As proof that my promise was kept I read the last paragraph over for the Sisters.  The last named said, Haynes with a Y if you please?  Irish not English".  Hence the scratching in the name.
