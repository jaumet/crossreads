<p>October 1916<br/>29th   (Sunday)   It is still raining.  Fritz sent over a few more shells into "Death Valley" about 200 yds from us last night but did practically no damage.  (He has been trying to get at our Railhead where the ammunition "Dump" is.)  I went out to the Mametz Dump on a wagon this morning &amp; out to the Longueval "dump" this afternoon.  Fritz was shelling it while I was there but did no serious damage.<br/>We have been giving him a hard peppering this afternoon with our artillery &amp; I saw about 200 rounds fired in 3 minutes from one of our batteries near here.  I passed about 200 prisoners on the road this morning.</p>
