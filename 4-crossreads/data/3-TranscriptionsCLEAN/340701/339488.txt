  
 A Tommy M.P. shot one of our fellows dead in Albert yesterday, because he tried to ride away on a bike when the Tommy wanted to detain him.  His name was Tulloch 5th field Coy Engineers. 
 Sunday 3-6-17 I am chancing a trip to Amiens today.  Had a good day & a good trip.  I particularly noticed the number of "Impasse" narrow alleys about 5 or 6 feet wide with houses opening one on each side, in every case dirty & generally swarming with Kids.  Some of them on the Hippodrome line were supplied with gates. Tram lines.  St Acheul, Hippodrome, Gambetta, Madeleine, Gare du Nord.  They are all single lines with frequent loops sometimes a wooden staff is used but they generally do without.  Most lines start from Gambetta. A central position with lines radiating in all directions.  The foot paths are very narrow.  There is'nt a street sufficiently wide for a double Tram in the Town.  But there are some fine Boulevards.  Received a letter from Jack Mac. 
 Monday 4-6-17 Seen Jack Mac. at Buire today he looks very well.  I was advised that I was 38th on the leave list yesterday.
