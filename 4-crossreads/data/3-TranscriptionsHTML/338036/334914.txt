<p>[12th June contd]<br/>simply rained over.  One landed just near German collecting cage wounding a man.  A squad was sent was sent out to get him and one of boys (10th Fld Amb) was cracked in leg.  At 2.30 pm the good news came that some of us were to go to Pont D'Achilles for a spell &amp; at 4 pm we set to tramp the 5 miles.   Did not sleep well.  Abcess on jaw.</p>
<p>Monday 11th<br/>Back at 2.0 pm to Charing Cross &amp; I was feeling very crook &amp; generally run down &amp; neuralgia.  Didn't sleep very much.  Fritz lobbed some H.Es near billets all night.  Officially announced that our losses during the Messines Battle were 10,000 just 1/3 of the enemy's.<br/>[Losses were more nearly equal]<br/>Tuesday 12th<br/>Quite early we received the news that we were to be relieved for awhile &amp; at 10.30 am set off for Pont Dachilles being followed all the way by shells.  On arrival at Pont Dachilles it was to find Fritz sending over some more of his huge naval shells &amp; one got two or three motor lorries &amp; blew them to bits beside making a hole in the road big enough for a house to go in.  Still feeling off color.  Had abscess lanced by staff Sgt Godfrey.  At 3.0 pm we set out again on the march to Neuve Eglise</p>
