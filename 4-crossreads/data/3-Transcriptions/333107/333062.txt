<p>Sat July 20</p>
<p>Went to dance at Arcadia. There was a good crowd there and we had an enjoyable time. I only missed 3 dances.</p>
<p>Sun July 21</p>
<p>More Rain. The War news continues good, and Fritz is being kept "on the move".</p>
<p>The Yanks are "well in" it now and doing good work.</p>
<p><u>Finished Letter 31 to M.S.</u></p>
<p>Mon 22<br/>Still raining. Lecture on "Electricity". Most interesting.</p>
<p>Attended Concert at Y.M. Miss Cooper's Party. Very Good.</p>
<p>Tues July 23  -  PARCEL from Mother</p>
<p>The rain cleared away after dinner, and it was quite fine again. Got a Letter from Lill and 1 from Mrs Ibbs and a big, fat parcel from Mother, which was mighty welcome.</p>
<p>Managed to get my boots changed at the Q.M. Store, a thing I've been trying to do for weeks. Was warned to parade at Medical Hut at 2 oclock. Thought I was up for another Board, but it turned out to be nothing more than to sign my last Board Papers.</p>
<p>After Tea, Doug and I went to Mrs Lancaster's and spent a pleasant couple of hours. It was a glorious moonlight night and we strolled along the front till about 10.30.</p>
<p>Alright, Mrs A.J. I'm a flat, am I. Right O, I'll pay you back for that when I come Home.</p>
