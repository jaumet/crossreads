<p>to Major Rabett, a smart man, one of the few that could take his place as driver or gunner.  A Bdr. was also killed.  Sgt. Muddle back to Bty., he was one of our original drivers.  Fitter Corp. Robert reported back, he was wounded at Longueville.  1,000 rounds of ammunition drawn from D.A.C.</p>
<p>15-4-1917, Sunday 5-30 a.m.<br/>"Lagnicourt".  Lost all of our guns.  Captured by the enemy this morning at day break.  The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Btys. 18 guns in all.  The 101st Bty. under Major Selmes, stuck to their guns (Howitzer) and was firing at a range of 200 yards.  In a few hours we got our guns back.  In the wagon got orders to harness up and stand by ready to retreat.  Our gunners coming to wagon lines in twos and threes.  Some with dial sights, telecopic sights, breech blocks &amp; etc.  The whole trouble occurred through the Infantry patrols going to sleep.  They ran through our guns, Germans following them.  We got the orders to retire.  Disgraceful, not a shot fired.  2-30 p.m.  Enemy driven</p>
