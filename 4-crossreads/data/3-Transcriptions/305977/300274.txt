<p>October 1915<br/>chocolate.  It was much appreciated.  Was promoted Corporal from 29th Septr</p>
<p>Tuesday 5th<br/>Wrote &amp; posted a letter to Kate.  Things were very quiet.  The Turk's guns were very silent all day except for a few rounds in the morning.  We got a clothing issue.  Some of us were very much in need of them.</p>
<p>Wednesday 6th<br/>Got a letter &amp; a couple of papers from mother this morning.  The warships were bombarding the coast near Achi Baba in the afternoon.  Abdul was very quiet "Beachy Bill" even had a very poor day.</p>
<p>Thursday 7th<br/>Another quiet day.  At 8.30 pm we carried out a demonstration right along the line.  A destroyer on our flank bombarded the Turks trenches.  She was rattling them in too.  We sent up several flares which lit up the trenches light as day.  We succeeded in drawing a lot of fire from the Turks.</p>
