<p>I didn't forget but I did enjoy my trip &amp; loved every minute of it.  They say Paris now is a pale shadow of Paris in peace time, if so I'd go dilly with joy in it then.  The beautiful streets, the shops &amp; the dear kind bright people, I had a very joyous time, going all the time, beautiful weather, saw an opera &amp; an operette (very French, delicious) a vaudeville show &amp; oh, I can't tell you all about it, I felt like a butterfly might feel coming out of its cocoon.</p>
<p>This is very high falutin, but you will understand, I wish you &amp; the Boss had been there.  I arrived back the day of a stunt everything very successful as you will have read.  Our lads were wonderful again, they try not to create ill feeling by praising the Australians above all others but it will &amp; cannot be altogether kept down.  And you can't wonder at it.  I am that proud of being an Australian and New Zealander.  Wait till I get home &amp; spread myself, I shall never stop talking.</p>
<p>We had four letters 60, 61, 62 &amp; 63 from you &amp; I know how you feel about Jock.  I got such a shock I didn't know.  Oh this war is awful</p>
