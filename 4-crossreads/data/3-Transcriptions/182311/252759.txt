<p>bumps and bumpers and bumped, for King Neptune commenced his revels there on Thursday night.&nbsp; Of course something unusual was expected and some of my chums were afraid to go to bed, I went and got in a couple of hours good sleep before my interruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The awakening came rather suddenly when with a big bump an officer was pitched into my cabin landing on a batch of toned photos put out to dry, when he arose he looked like a moving picture show, then they tried to put him in bed with me, but I stopped that, then we all turned out on the hatch for the next move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two baths were filled and in quick succession every officer was carried struggling just enough to keep the excitement up and ducked.&nbsp; Some wished to be allowed to remove their pyjamas, it was permitted, but their pyjamas were placed in the water too, I found it very funny to watch the expressions as the discovery was made.&nbsp; Then a fight with wet towels, pyjamas and water until the line having been passed, and thoroughly tired out, we sought our cabins for a little sleep which we could get before &quot;reveille.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our quarters were in a fearful mess, but we changed the frowns of the bed and bath stewards into smiles by the use of a golden key, the hat being taken round on their behalf.&nbsp; About one o&#39;clock on Friday I was asked to take the part of Neptune&#39;s Queen in the big display on deck, so at 3.30 well, I had to do some smart work in preparing my costumes, but I think the result was good, the photos should show you.</p>
