<p>Howitzers near my camp kept up an incessant fire all the night and the roar invariably woke me before I fell soundly asleep</p>
<p>Sunday 8th Aug<br/>I was up early and it was fairly cool but bracing. There was still plenty of munitions flying about &ndash; in the air of course.</p>
<p>It was a perfect pandemonium Cracking and barging on all sides. At about 10 am the Turks put one of our guns out of action and our mechanics immediately set to work to have it fixed up. Their shell hit the gun well on the buffer which contains the springs. The enemy gave us a good deal of what our chaps call hurry up stuff in artillery vernacular. In my store apology a large piece of shell fell and hit the top of a case piercing it right through to the biscuits inside.</p>
