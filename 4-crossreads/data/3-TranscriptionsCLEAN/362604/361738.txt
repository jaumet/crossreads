rain so we waited for an Hour under the Trees & then thinking that the rain had set in for the night started Home through it.  We got nice & wet in 20 minutes & then the rain ceased altogether.  But we have not suffered by the event in any way.  Next afternoon we had to leave for Home again as the Boat left at 6 a.m. on Monday.  So we sadly & reluctantly said au Revoir at 5 p.m. to Gran & Marie & Auntie drove us down to Sulby Glen Station.
Well, Dad, I've to write to Mum, yet, so I'll finish the other bit in Her letter.  Love to all & Kind Regards to Mr. Cocks & Otto.
Your Fond SonHarry.
