<p>Wednesday 28 March</p>
<p>My eyes are sore after sitting round the smoky fire last night.  Left the "shanty" at 9.15 a.m. and reached Beaulencourt at 10 o'clock.  Le Transloy lies only a stone's throw further up the road.  Big log fire going all day in the old ruined house we have patched up.  No orders have yet been issued relative to moving further on.  Sleeping on old wire mattrass tonight.  Observation balloon was taken past here today.  It used to be in Delville Wood &amp; now it has been transferred to a position nearer the front.</p>
