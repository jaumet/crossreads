<p>Sunday, November, 1914<br/>Well we're off at last, we sailed about 6 am, the sight was one that I will never forget.  In three long files extending for miles our 40 ships  moved off our escort being in front both sides &amp; behind.  Unfortunately soon after the start the Pera had some trouble with her engines &amp; steered a very erratic course.  We lie second in the middle of three following the flagship Orvieto.  Whilst at Albany it rained nearly every night, the weather was most peculiar, the sky would be cloudless &amp; in a few minutes we would have heavy showers.  For this we shall not forget Albany.</p>
<p>Monday  November, 1914<br/>Sea much calmer in consequence our regular work was resumed.</p>
<p>My Pony has a lump as now, poor little devil he is always in trouble he cant eat now &amp; is painfully poor.</p>
<p>Whichever way we look there are boats &amp; surrounded by warships.  It would be a wonderful view from a warship.</p>
<p>Approaching tropic of Capricorn heat becoming more intense we walk about half naked only our nether garments on.</p>
