<p>5.  We do not seem to have lost much, if any, time over our call at Bombay &amp; will probably still reach Port Said on 28th as Rid expected when he last wrote me.  I am going to Cairo with John &amp; Gwen &amp; from there to Alexandria, that is the best way but will send Rid a wire as soon as we get to Port Said.  It will all depend on what time of day we get in whether I can go right there the same day.  Rid has sent me a list of trains.<br/>I am amazed to find myself almost here the time has not been too long and I shall be so pleased when I can send you a cable from my final destination.<br/>You will know I am all right &amp; safe won't you, whatever you may hear from papers &amp;c.</p>
