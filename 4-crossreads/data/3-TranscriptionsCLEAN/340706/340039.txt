At the killing of the horse Young who had seen bodies in all stages of decomposition & mutilation in the Somme offensive had to go into the open air for fear of fainting. On same Mansell who flies at heights up to 15,000 feet in bombing raids could not mount steps about 50 ft high the other day because he began to feel & had to come down. 
 All the lads have gone to a VAD dance to night but as I dont like VAD & am too old for dancing I do not go. 
 25-3-19 (Tues) Am very staid & proper this week & have even renounced drinking so that I may accumulate a little cash for bust up on last night & also I purpose returning via Paris & that costs money. Life is very expensive. Egg even in mess cost 60 centimes Whisky 60c Brandy 90c 
 26-3-19 (Wed) Yesterday I forgot to mention I met in town Germaine & Louise Pegara & had afternoon tea then in a patisserie opposite
