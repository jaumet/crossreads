<p>Tuesday 18 December 1917<br/>Day off, breakfast in bed 9 a.m., bath &amp; town 11 a.m., bought rug at Club (Pt. 115).<br/>Abandoned by Miss Hughes 1.15 p.m. so went Barrage (alone) as alas am generally forced to do at length.  Pretty misty day, heavy rain at intervals &ndash; &frac12; hour brings one to Barrage station after a quick trip through flat green fields all I imagine watered by canals from the old Nile.  Very interesting &amp; pictures truly biblical all the way.  Men driving oxen in the plough, a shepherd walking in front of his flock &amp; calling them on to follow, etc.<br/>Rode on trolly to tea, gardens after tea, roamed through lovely gardens, admired old Nile (not any English person to speak to).  Back in Cairo 6.30, 27th 6.30 p.m.</p>
