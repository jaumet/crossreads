  
 Sunday, 11 July, 1915 Dressings as usual I am becoming an expert at it, every day the Capt allows me to to do a more difficult one, it is most interesting work and medical students must learn a lot by this experience I have learned things that otherwise I would have had to study for some time.  We are making good speed for Malta, this is another new place we are seeing, the LHFA are tourists alright.  I wrote another poem tonight as I had one of my rare moods on, this time it was to my mother on the losing of her three sons from home.  The other day I picked up a piece of paper portion of the Rotheram [Rotherham] Advertiser a Yorkshire paper & in it I was surprised to see my old Emden piece, that makes the fifth paper it was in. 
 Monday, 12 July, 1915 In spite of a head wind we made good speed all day it was a trifle rough, dressing all day as usual.  A lot of our chaps have gone under to illness, we have seven of B. sick down with fever now, who says the medical corps dont run danger, I am convinced now they work just as hard if not harder and run as much danger as those in the firing line one of our chaps named McLachlan died in Heliopolis about a month ago.
