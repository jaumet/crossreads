 are no fences, apparently their plots of ground are divided by drains that also act to irrigate it.  It seems quite funny to see them praying; I saw two or three praying as we passed them.  I do not know whether their prayers were for or against us;  We arrived at Cairo at little before sundown, we had a cup of cocoa & a piece of bread & cheese waiting for us at the station & the cocoa was the best I have ever tasted; 
 by the time we unloaded the horses & were ready to move off, it was beginning to get dark, we marched to the barracks & had a few minutes talk with some Territorials & learned that a Camel Corps of 125 men had gone out to meet some Turks 3 weeks previously & only 5 men returned.  nothing has been seen
