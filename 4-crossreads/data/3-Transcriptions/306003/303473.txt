<p>12-8-16<br/>Sat 12th<br/>Had another days good rest today &amp; everything seems clear so far as Turks are concerned   a few of our men were sent out this morning to bury the dead around Bir-El-Abd &amp; to collect anything that is lying about;  One or two of the lads killed a couple of days ago were stripped of boots &amp; gear but otherwise they were not touched   only men belonging to the 1st &amp; 2nd Bde could be found &amp; all these had been reported dead when we retired, these were buried, &amp; all gear left by us recovered;</p>
<p>On account of our horses getting cut up on the 4th only two Squadrons from each Regt could get mounted &amp; one Sqd of the 3rd Regt came with us to make us up to strength &amp; one Squadron of the 3rd went with the 2nd</p>
