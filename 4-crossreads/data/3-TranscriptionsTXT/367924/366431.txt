Out in the Dust25th Oct 1917
Dear AuntJust a few lines to let you know that I am quite well & trust that you are both the same & I am just writing these few lines as we are told that this is the last chance we will have of writing for at least three weeks.
Well take every care of your self & do not worry about me as I am alright as what is to be will be & worring will do no good at all. Tell Birts Wife I had no time to write her a note or else I would have, but I will write to you all as soon as ever I get the chance. I am afraid we have no chance of getting our mail before we move out, I would have liked to have heard from you & Nell.
I have not recieved the parcel Nell sent or the one that Rodgers sent for you, we will not recieve them now till we get settled again. I will write again on the very first chance I get. Well I must close with wishing you all A Merry Xmas & A Happy New Year God Bless & Take care of You. Good Bye for the Present
I remain yourever lovingW. Weaber
