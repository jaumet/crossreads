<p>18 September 1915<br/>Saturday Arrived Lemnos</p>
<p>No sleep again last night on account of the itch, the doctor thought that perhaps a little refreshment might do us good &amp; at tea we were ordered bread &amp; butter. We up anchored at 6 at last &amp; proceeded to Mudros arriving there at 11 to find the harbour very conjested with shipping. The airship followed us for a long way &amp; the way she can be handled is a treat, on our way up the harbour 8 hospital ships were passed the Aquatania sailed this morning for England with fever cases on board. Mudros the chief town of Lemnos is a few brick shanties with a rather superior type of church in it &amp; the sole living of the populace is fishing &amp; rural work. A few windmills adorn the ridges round a place they call Turks Head but nothing more breaks the view over dry &amp; desolute hills that resemble very much the arid hills of Asia in the Red Sea. The French have a fairly large garrison in this place</p>
<p>19 September 1915<br/>Sunday Went ashore</p>
<p>Spent a real good night at last &amp; temperature was down to normal, at daybreak we moved further up the harbor passing on our way dozens of ships of the mercantile fleet, many French warships &amp; heaps of ours also we took up our anchorage off the Mudros pier, stationary hospitals are on all the hills round the island in fact its practically a sick island the French also have their hospital here. Turkish prisoners are making roads by the mile under Sengalese guards. at 2 pm we were told that we had to go ashore to hospital &amp; 10 minutes afterwards we were lowered in stretchers over the side into a naval picquet boat then landed at the quay to be picked up by a motor ambulance &amp; conveyed to No 1 Gen Hospital &amp; dumped in the hospital. The Swiftsure left during the harbour &amp; she was no sooner out of the harbor than a submarine had two goes at her but both luckily missed she then went up to the Cape &amp; its rumored they are going to force the Straits. doubt it.</p>
