Australian hospital for Australians, who had lost their limbs. I had a pleasant time at Southall
I left Southall on the 15th Sept 1918 to proceed to Liverpool, thence to Australia. Fifty of us were on our way to Home sweet Home once again!
We left London at 9.30 in the morning and reached Liverpool at 5.30 (evening) We embarked the same night on our transport (The Arawa) there were 841 going home!
We set sail on the 17th September; on the day before we sailed, a big bunch of Yankees arrived from America to carry on the good work we were invalided from.
We had a strong escort with us, some dozen or so to keep the tin fish away! Our boat was cleverly camouflaged likewise were the destroyers etc Our friends the destroyers left us after 4 days, we only had 4 left with us
The weather increased in hotness as we moved towards the tropics
We were only left with a battle cruiser
