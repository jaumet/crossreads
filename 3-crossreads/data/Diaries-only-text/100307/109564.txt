her husband and a coal black negro of the French Colonial Army. The crowd here was very smart and gay. On the road an officer was riding a motor scooter ? evidently somewhat of a novelty. Returned the same way noticing the home of M. Poincaire, President of the Republic. Many taxis and motors running round. Just as we reached the hotel it began to rain a little. Sat in the lounge talking until 1 pm and then went out to the cafe Weber and had some Chablis ordinaire, fish, beef, compote de fruits benedictine (item af.) and having bought La Vie Parisienne from a kiosk returned for a rest and a read.
At 4 o'c again redezvoused with our little friend who takes up so much time and adjourned with her and Mrs E. at 5 to tea just round the corner and overlooking the Tuilieries. Find this custom of making this a time of conversation and recreation is most agreeable. Returned to hotel and chatted until preparatory to going to the Theatre des Varieties. At 8.15 left with Mdme Cumsha Mrs E. per taxi and on arrival at the Theatre found "Le Roi de l?Air" just commenced. The play was entirely in French but easy to follow by
