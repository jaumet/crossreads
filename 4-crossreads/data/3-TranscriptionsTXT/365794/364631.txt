 Saturday 17 August 1917 [1918] Took tram to Heliopolis 6.30 p.m. &amp; enjoyed sunset.  2 days of soft wind &amp; big snowy clouds make one think of home again, &amp; now my thoughts are beginning to turn for the 1st time to thoughts of some day getting back across the old ocean &amp; to see dear Mith again.
