 Tuesday 5 June 1917. 
 Lying in harbor. Coaling operations finished on &quot;Port Sydney&quot; (A15) at 10 a.m. and on our boat &quot;Boorara&quot; (A42) at 1 p.m. At 2 p.m. we weighed anchor and after the ropes were unfastened from buoys we moved out of the harbor (breakwater.) and now at 4 pm. we are now out at sea once more. During the morning I changed some of our money for the Ceylon coinage. (Sinagelese) 
 A whale has just been seen by some of the boys at 4 pm. 
  Officers on the boat especially the O.C. troops, on board showed themselves to be no men and treated us like dirt  while anchored in harbor. 
 Port Sydney moved out 2 hrs before us and with no escort same as us. On leaving there were 5 cruisers at Colombo. 
 Took snaps with V.P.K.(A) camera.
