fleet bombarding the Dardanelles - We left Port in Company with the "Ascot" clearing Lemnos Island about 11.30 a.m. - We carry very heavy packs including three "Iron" rations (little bags containing biscuits, small tin of bully beef and little packets of beef extract) 200 rounds of ammunition and bundle of firewood the "Ascot" has the rest of the 13th aboard - heard the big guns going an hour after leaving Lemnos - heard bombardment all day off Gallipoli (in the Gulf of Saros) saw our warships all along the coast firing continuously  and many transports lined up along the Coast ready to land and some landing and some transports which had landed their troops returning - on arriving close inshore saw the warships firing distinctly and could see where the shells landed - anchored off Gallipoli about 4.30 p.m. and had dinner - many other transports and battle ships all around us.
