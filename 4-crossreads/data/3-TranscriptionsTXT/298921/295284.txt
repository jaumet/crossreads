 November, 1915 Sunday 21 The Turkish Rifle is a "mauser", but not finished quite as well as the ones the Boers had &amp; no  double  report is heard like the old Mauser. Posted Diary yesterday. I used a bit of the Independent to skim the scum off my tea today.  glad to read of course  The Sheep skin waistcoats are most useful, the wool turns the rain &amp; when not worn the waistcoat makes an excellent hipper &ndash; i.e. buffer t'wixt your bones &amp; the earth. The Fleas are not quite so bad &amp; I am getting better at catching them it is a fine art to tell whether a Flea is walking on  you , or merely circling you with his back as he crawls along the shirt &amp; it makes a difference when you proceed to capture in the Dark.
