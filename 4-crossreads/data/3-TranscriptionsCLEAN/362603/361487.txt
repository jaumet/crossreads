People think we have tons of time to write but we have no wives or mothers to do our washing ironing & mending   We must go out to the Theatre one night a week & we always have one night on Duty & Ellis & I have 2 nights out of Camp so we are only 3 nights left to write & 2 letters a night is quite a Task after office work nearly all day. Well, I must get at some work now.  We are always kept going at Top speed.  Best Love to You all & to the Neighbours & all enquiring Friends, Our Greetings Love Harry XXX"
