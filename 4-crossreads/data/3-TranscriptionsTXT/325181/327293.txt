Atmosphere close & muggy sky threatening. X Swimming bath not available on the well deck -9th  Threatening. Sea getting rough. Making for the African Coast at 131/2 Knots to avoid an expected hurricane. 7 pm Just finished 1 hours pack drill. La Touche 2nd in charge gave me 3 days pack drill because I hadn't shaved for 24 hours. Paraded to the OC who reduced sentence to 2 hours & promised to look into the matter. Rotten when a man has to needlessly shave every day.10th On fatigue duty today but have done nothing except read & wash a few clothes
