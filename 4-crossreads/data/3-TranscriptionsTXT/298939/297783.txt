Heard little Flo play the piano & played myself, & enjoyed the eveningArrived back at 1 AM.Went over to the School on Sunday afternoon - stayed till about 8.45 pmFeel bluey tonight on account of a brush with the enemy, represented by Capt Merrilees - who is a terribly jumpy individual & says the most ridiculous & pointed things.  I think his heart is right, but his head runs away with him at times.
