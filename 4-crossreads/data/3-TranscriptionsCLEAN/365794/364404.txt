  
 Thursday 4 January 1917 [1918] Day off, rose 10 a.m. town & lunch at Club with 2 sisters - torpedoed ones - then bought shoes Pt. 148 1/2 (30/-) then Helouan for 4 p.m. tea & had 1st real glimpse of the desert and saw the Nile like a ribbon flowing beside us most of the way - tea at Grand Hotel outside & very nicely done for Pt. 6.  P.C. from Edith & she already loves the little Kathleen - written 15th Nov. '17 so she will bring happiness to Stafford I hope. Back at 27th for 1st dinner 7.15 p.m. & very tired, cold will cling to the bitter end & antrum is troublesome as usual.
