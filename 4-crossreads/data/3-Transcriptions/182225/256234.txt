<p>MARCH &nbsp; SUNDAY 19 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Wrote &amp; posted a lot of letters after&nbsp;tea and then we went for a walk round the beach &amp; town for a few hours. Then we got rickshaws down to the ferry; got to boat about 10.30 pm and found she was to sail at 8 Am&nbsp;next day. We had a good time in Durban and had a fair reception &nbsp;The men behaved them selves very well. There were no rows at all that I know of and only about half a dozen got drunk. All very sorry to leave Durban</p>
