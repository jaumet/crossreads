He was cheered and counted out alternatively but he did not mind this but continued to the end. 28th  Beautiful weather but  only did 274 miles for the run the A.M.B. & the A.S.C. gave a combined concert which was quite passable. 29th  Washing & mending parade today as I had done mine a day or so before decided to have a good spell. I might mention as I had been appointed mess commander & made a Lance Corporal I had very little to do & as a matter of fact the whole unit had very little to do in the way of drill or anything else. Today received orders that 2 signallers & one L/Corporal has to go on the Bridge for signalling purposes, also to keep a look out for submarines etc. with the officers. This has to be done day & night. When in convoy there is both a lot of lamp & semaphore signalling besides knowledge of international flag work.
