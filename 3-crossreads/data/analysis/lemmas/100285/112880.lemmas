 A big batch of men came in to the O.T.B. from " Hurdcott " today . 31st . Have got a slight cold in my head the first I have had for age , they are complaint I seldom suffer from at ani time . Well I went over to the OTB on the off chanc of see Len this afternoon I thought there might have been the luck for the telegram which I sent last night to get through in time for him to catch the 10.15 from Paddington , he got the wire as a matter of fact the same night at 11.30 came down to Paddington think his train left at 10.35 so miss it , he then wire on to Chunder the Adjutant that he would be down by the 12.27 which he caught , I went down to Warminst we had some tea in a littl joint befor the train left .
