the Eglise de St Germaine. As we were looking around this old church, a priest came up to us dressed in all his paraphenalia and a huge bunch of keys hanging by his side. He asked us if we would like to see the Secret Room, the very name made an impression on us and wishing to see the mysteries of this Secret Room we followed the priest up a narrow flight of stairs in pitch darkness until we reached a very small room near the top of the tower of the church. There was nothing particular about this room other than the fact that some of the French Kings in troublous time had come to this place for refuge. Hidden away in a recess was a fine piece of carving which occupied nearly the whole side of the room. This was said to have been made by the monks in of the monasteries. After we had been initiated into the so called mysteries of this secret room the priest handed us a box to put a collection in, for, as he said the upkeep of this place. The whole procedure was gone through in such an abnoxious fashion that we, to say the least of us, were "knacked."
