<p>France<br/>31st May, 1916</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>This addressed envelope came to light among a bundle of old orders, memos &amp; other trash. I've already written to thank you for the stores mentioned on the fly page, but even if this does catch the same mail I don't think you will grumble about it.</p>
<p>Last night I got some cable forms from Father one of which I immediately filled in &amp; sent to London, from where, I understand, it will be transmitted to you. You ought to get it in about three days time. They are handy things to have, because it is not always possible to get a cable away from here. You have to wait till someone is going somewhere handy to the cable office, which is not a frequent occurrence, I wrote a few letters last night, but just as I got into my swing we got an alarm which put an end to it for the night.</p>
<p>Everything is well with all our friends &amp; I'm good as gold</p>
<p>Your affectionate son</p>
<p>Arthur</p>
