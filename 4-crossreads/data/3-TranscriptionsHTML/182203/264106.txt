<p>for walks &amp; yesterday we <strike>go</strike> hired a funny old cab, (somewhat like the Egyptian "Garry") with an awful mongrel of a horse &ndash; travelled at the rate of three miles an hour, the best we could procure. We thoroughly enjoy our little drive &ndash; had a little French girl with us &amp; she made us talk <u>French</u> all the time &ndash; well, we had some fun out of it. Must try to understand what these people say. We are to learn a few words    &amp; phrases each day so try to improve our french a little. Last Sunday-morn I went to H.C. early and quite a number were there. Had to get up much earlier but it was a very beautiful morning. Glad it was not this morning, very cold &amp; rainy to-day.<br/>In the afternoon, went to a Military Show, was not too bad &ndash; the Tent Pegging etc was not much. Sorry none of our Aust. horse men were in it. One or two weeds of Australians</p>
