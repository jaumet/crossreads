 Dear George, 
 This is another church half way between our camp & the Railway Station & village of Tidwell. Just near here the Chestnut trees meet across the Roadway &  are about 100 ft high. At night passing through it is as black as the ace of spades. I was watching a good game of soccer on Saturday. My word they can play the game here. We have a fire in the hut from 4.30 until it goes out. It is supposed to be put out at lights out but it burns all night & we are lovely & warm. If we have to go outside it is bad though. You know what it is like when you have to go out to the back on a windy cold night, it is generally the cold nights that one has to do these things. Love  Harry
