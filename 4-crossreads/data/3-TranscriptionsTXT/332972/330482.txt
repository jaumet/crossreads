 [Newspaper clipping with handwritten date &ndash; 17/6] Deportation Of Aliens. Arrangements  Proceeding. No Decision Yet. Melbourne. Thursday. &ndash; Regarding a report that a large number of German internees were shortly to be deported from the Commonwealth, Mr. Watt stated to-night that some months ago the Federal Government appointed a committee, of which Senator Fairbairn was chairman, to consider a number of problems which would arise at the close of the war in relation to aliens and to aliens' property. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee has made a series of recommendations, based to some extent upon the recommendations of a similar body in Great Britain, which involved, amongst other things, a decision as to the number of men who were to be deported from Australia after the proclamation of peace. In addition, a special commission was recently appointed to deal with the question of the release of individual internees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No general report has yet been submitted by this body. The Government has under consideration the report of Senator Fairbairn's committee, and had dealt with the bulk of it. They were also in communication with the British authorities as to the arrangements which the Commonwealth might make when the proper time arrived for the deportation of certain classes of alien enemies.
