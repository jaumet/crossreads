<p>in fact everything possible.  I managed to take a photo on the deck as well as one of the whole ship.  Although newly painted up we could see where she had been hit the funnels especially, being pierced in several places &amp; patched up in others.  We were the envy of the ship on our return</p>
<p>Monday 19th I had orders again  pack up for Hospital ship but when all was ready were told again to stand by.  Received a mail from London &amp; was answering same when I was called up for fatigue duty.  It consisted of carrying shells to the aft deck up a steep staircase.  We started at 4 P.M. &amp; with a spell for tea, kept going till 8.15.  each case weighed over a cwt &amp; it was quite the most strenuous work done by me to date.</p>
<p>Tuesday 20th nothing more heard of going to Alexandria.  Practised bandaging during the day.  Weather cold &amp; bleak.  Managed to get a good snap of submarine 28.</p>
<p>Wednesday 21st called for guard duty &amp; appointed to 3rd shift. When about to go on received order to pack up to go to other ship.  We did so but heard no more that day.  Weather wet cold &amp; dispiriting.</p>
<p>Thursday 22nd  Began to think we were not to go after all.  Orders read out concerning treatment of native villages.  Moslem quarter out of bounds &amp; prices to be regulated etc.  About 10 a.m. we were again ordered to pack up the Colonel himself appearing &amp; assuring us that we would rejoin unit very soon.  We embarked on a minesweeper late trawler "Avon" of Grimsby.  Then we called on various other ships</p>
