<p>The Day<br/>By Henry Chappell</p>
<p>(The author of this magnificent poem is Mr. Henry Chappell, a railway porter at Bath.  Mr. Chappell is known to his comrades as the "Bath Railway Poet".  A poem such as this lifts him to the rank of a national poet.)</p>
<p>You boasted the Day, and you toasted the Day,<br/>And now the Day has come.<br/>Blasphemer, braggart and coward all,<br/>Little you reck of the numbing ball,<br/>The blasting shell, or the "white arm's" fall,<br/>As they speed poor humans home.</p>
<p>You spied for the Day, you lied for the Day,<br/>And woke the Day's red spleen.<br/>Monster, who asked God's aid Divine,<br/>Then strewed His seas with the ghastly mine;<br/>Not all the waters of all the Rhine<br/>Can wash thy foul hands clean.</p>
<p>You dreamed for the Day, you schemed for the Day;<br/>Watch how the Day will go.<br/>Slayer of age and youth and prime<br/>(Defenceless slain for never a crime)<br/>Thou art steeped in blood as a hog in slime,<br/>False friend and cowardly foe.</p>
<p>You have sown for the Day, you have grown for the Day;<br/>Yours is the harvest red.<br/>Can you hear the groans and the awful cries?<br/>Can you see the heap of slain that lies,<br/>And sightless turned to the flame-split skies<br/>The glassy eyes of the dead?</p>
<p>You have wronged for the Day, you have longed for the Day;<br/>That lit the awful flame.<br/>'Tis nothing to you that hill and plain<br/>Yield sheaves of dead men amid the grain;<br/>That widows mourn for their loved ones slain,<br/>And mothers curse thy name.</p>
<p>But after the Day there's a price to pay<br/>For the sleepers under the sod,<br/>And Him you have mocked for many a day &ndash;<br/>Listen, and hear what He has to say:<br/>"Vengeance is mine, I will repay,"<br/>What can you say to God?</p>

<p>Please be kind to England,<br/>She isn't very strong,<br/>Her Navy's inefficient,<br/>Her Army's all gone wrong;<br/>Her A.R.P. is useless,<br/>Her Air Force far too small,<br/>Her people so degenerate,<br/>She's no morale at all.</p>
<p>She doesn't want to fight you,<br/>She's so convinced you'll win;<br/>She'll let you take her Empire<br/>If it will save her skin.<br/>She's old, decayed and senile,<br/>And you have strength and youth.<br/>So please be kind to England,<br/>Don't keep abusing England,<br/>Be nice to poor old England &ndash;<br/>Or you may learn the truth.</p>
