<p>Nth &amp; await the patrol party who had to finish repairing the line, we jogged along quietly &amp; arrived at the station, &amp; waited there. I was standing on the ground later on talking to a Tommie when I heard a Fritz Machine overhead somewhere. I took cover behind the Tender &amp; no sooner had I got there when I heard a Whiz Bang &amp; a Bomb exploded about 50 yds away in the bush, I ducked down quick &amp; I heard several pieces strike the Eng &amp; Tender, I then crawled under the Tender likewise my Mate &amp; stopped there until Fritz had cleared out, he only dropped the one, After awaiting about 1 hour the Patrol Party returned &amp; we set sail for home, only having a couple of small delays enroute. On the journey homeward as soon as we passed one lot of search lights looking for Fritz we would come to another. We arrived back at 11 Pm &amp; I stood by my Eng until I was releived at midnight.</p>
