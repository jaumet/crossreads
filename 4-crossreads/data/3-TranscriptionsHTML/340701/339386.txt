A few dozen at a time are placed around the ship with orders to keep a look out for periscopes &amp; if they see one to fire at it if they are sure of hitting it but if not to keep firing between it &amp; the ship to stop it from aiming I believe.  <strike>These?</strike> The gaurd have to have their boots off &amp; a life belt on.  These lifebelts are a dam nuisance they take up so much room we can't pass each other comfortably anywhere.  we keep forgetting to allow for the lifebelt and get jammed in the narrow passages nor can we find room enough to sit at the tables, however the tucker is so bad that it reduces our bulk &amp; tends to equalize matters.  We are having lovely weather.</p>
