[11th Feb. contd]During the excitement a wounded Fritz reeled in & while dressing him I got a button as a souvenir.  The wounded stuck it well notwithstanding there were some bad cases - abdominal especially.  We put thro about 50.  When we finished we were trying to stumble about with swabs etc up to our ankles and I had a rotten headache.  Bombs fuses gun cotton were lying about everywhere too.  At last collecting our stuff we retraced our way back to Suicide Corner and got a welcome cup of coffee.  Marched back to Baths & arrived turned into bed at 5.30 in morning.
