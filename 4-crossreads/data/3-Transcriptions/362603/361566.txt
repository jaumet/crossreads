<p>2.  Next day I walked all around the Strand, Piccadilly, Holborn   Westminster, Pall Mall, Whitehall, Oxford St, Regent St. Haymarket, Covent Garden Market, Leicester Square, oh! All the places You read about.  I bought some Films at Selfridge's which is one of the D.J's of London.  I went back to Dinner at Horseferry Rd.  I was with my Mate all the time.  He was on night duty &amp; managed to get his sleep in during the night<br/>I met Noel Holman, Sid Herbert, Les. Walsh an old School-mate &amp; 2 other fellows that I have known for years but who are not known to You.  You meet fellows all over London.  It is just wonderful how You meet.  I went to the Hippodrome in Leicester Square in the afternoon.  It is a lovely theatre.  The show was of the Pantomine Sort &amp; fairly good.  I have seen Pantomine's in her Majesty's, Sydney, that would make this London Play look like a bad amateur show.  Probably the War is the cause of it.  It is wonderful to see England going on as she is.  Business as usual &amp; yet in almost every family someone has gone.  There is a chap who works round this Hospital who has lost 3 Brothers &amp; whose wife has lost 3 Brothers.  But they've got to carry on.  It is hard making ends meet &amp; coal Kerosene, sugar butter, &amp; tea &amp; flour are only sold in tiny quantities.  There are refreshments to be had- Kill-me-</p>
