<p>February 5<br/>Clerks and O.R. staff.</p>
<p>At Havre on Sunday afternoon, Blinc and self into the Y.M. hut, and there till show ended.  An amusing afternoon, and a great Padre.  One of his stunts was "Advice to a Young Man". The idea was to each write on an envelope some piece of pithy advice:  each was then read out in turn from the stage and judged by the diggers &ndash; prize being cigarettes, tinn'd fruit and puddings.  Here are some &ndash; the winning being,</p>
<p>A pause in time:  save a trip to 39!<br/>Never let the wife learn French!<br/>We've had O.C.'s long enough:  get married and be an O.C. yourself!<br/>Never lift your beer by the handle &ndash; it might break off!<br/>In the next war, join the Salvation Army.<br/>Get busy! and populate the country for the next war!</p>
<p>Tents and pedantic advice were 'outed' every time &ndash; even the bible most venerable and wordy.</p>
