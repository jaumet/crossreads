26/9/15 In evening siege battery blew Abdul's trenches about. Down at Hellas a big action seems to be in progress ? the distant roll of heavy ordnance sounds like angry thunder. A quiet evening here only relieved by a little outburst at 9 pm. Our bombers picked a little redoubt and dropped a good bomb right inside ? dead silence. Fired another and the worm turned. Blazed away at us with machine guns and rifle fire. Bombers well under cover with their little piece of drain pipe and gunpowder charges keep quietly plonking more in until a silence descended on the scene so loud that it could almost be heard.

27/9/15 Stand to 0435. hospital ships a mass of lights lying side by side. Rifle fire fairly heavy. Rumble of artillery at Cape Hellas continuous all night. The monitors here dealing out heavy shells which land on Turks trenches with resounding "plonk". Back to bed at 0535 till 0800. Very nice to lie in dugout and hear the warships lamming it in. Bombs m. gun and heavier musketry than usual make up the peaceful country life we wake up to here! Snipers on Chessboard slapping into top of sandbags near my door crack, crack, all the time.
0700. Turkish (German) artillery commenced to bombard us and kept it up with 1.75m shells for two hours. Firing at the rate of 2 shots a minute so fully 200 shells landed hereabouts ? pretty warm. Mostly bursting on rear of hill quite unoccupied
