Elelle  raining hard & a big sea - was not the Almighty kind to keep the elements in control!! till we got away! Sea rough Disembarked 4 p.m. with [indecipherable] & Marched 3 miles to [indecipherable] East - ruddy cold & rough choppy sea. Just discovered I left my Sovereign belt with X6/-/- in bathroom on the Boat - No blankets tonight, but too tired to bother - Relief the strain of watching the Turk is over & I think to shift  20,000  men and guns in 2 nights without the enemy knowing is good work.
