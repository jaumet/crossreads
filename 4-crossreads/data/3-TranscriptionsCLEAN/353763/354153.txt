  
 off Port Moresby we heard  -  There seems to have been mismanagement in higher quarters than those of the stokers & [indecipherable]  -  Once on board the Berrima, the action of gravity brought us pretty close to the proximity of the Bar & drinks came along and here we heard how Elwell fell with 3 bullets thro his head  -  2 hours after he'd left the ship a gallant Nave officer - How Pockley was dressing a German's wrist   -   when the G.S. hand had been blown away by a detonator - when he got a bullet thro his spine  -  How Colonel Holmes & his son in law Travers rushed the wireless station & held up 9 Germans with their revolvers & took their arms & locked them up in a room  -  We picked up Captain Lambton & had more drinks & heard a good deal about Germans & their ways  -  We saw Dr Howse VC & a good more all talking & enjoying the occasion  -  Where we sat on the Berrima we cd  look forward & watch the niggers bringing out & piling up entrenching tools for no one
