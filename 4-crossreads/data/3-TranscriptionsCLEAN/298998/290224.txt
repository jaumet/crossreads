 26th to 31st. I have quite recovered from the little Xmas excitement. Bored almost to death and have nothing definite in view, unless it is to be prolonged misery and monotony in Hunland. "Old Bill" is absent on leave much to the relief of all. It is a treat to be free from the old bounder's visits; even a short period of 24 hours absence, is conspicuous. Most of the men who shared my early days of misery have sufficiently recovered to go to the Laager (camp). My companion who arrived 7th June, is the only other man in this ward who arrived with the first convoy from Valenciennes. My wound is nearly healed. 
 The Spanish Red Cross representative visited us recently. It is supposed by most men that he is a Hun in disguise. This may or may not be so. Anyway, I risked consequences and asked him if I were not eligible for exchange. He conversed with the Hun Surgeon, who merely "Ya! Ya'd" and walked away. The supposed Spanish gentleman informed me that he would do his utmost in assisting me out of Germany. 
 1918. Jan. 1. Usual Monotony. The Huns consumed ale during the greater part of the day and received extra food but we prisoners fared poorly on the ordinary diet. A Hun under-officer has constantly worried me lately to sell him soap and food stuff, which of course, I refused. He persistently remarks "lager, Bell", when the specialist makes his weekly tour of inspection, he does his utmost to persuade the Hun Surgeon to mark me for discharge to the Altdamm Camp. Fortunately, the Surgeon wishes me to remain until my wound heals properly. The under-officer came to me today and offered me a walking-stick, which I refused. He then endeavored to compel me to walk, my refusal increased his vile temper and jealousy. No doubt he will eventually succeed in victimising me; in any case I am desirous of seeking a change and feel quite prepared for future misery and hardship. 
 Men who have experienced the Lager ordeals, speak very discouragingly of the camp conditions, but matters cannot be
