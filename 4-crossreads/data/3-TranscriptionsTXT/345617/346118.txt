 Juillet 15 Had a quiet day today. Very little work except [indecipherable] fatigues. We had a massed Coy photo taken this morning but I do not expect it to be any good as the conditions of the weather &amp; position were not favourable. Went to Service in the Church Army Hut in the evening. 
 Juillet 16. Nos 1 &amp; 2 Sections had route march in the morning &ndash; about 18.K. Route &ndash; Corbie &ndash; Port Noyelles - [indecipherable] &ndash; Corbie. Inspection of shortages in equipment &amp; clothing in afternoon. Nothing of importance to report as regards our own affairs. Heavy attacks on the French in Champagne District. Heavy losses to [indecipherable] French gains. Russians doing well.
