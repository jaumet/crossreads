ahead of me, it was a Fritz High Explosive. The shell struck the Road fair in the Centre &amp; blew up the Cobble stones in the Air, I took cover at once behind a Tree &amp; the stones were falling around me everywhere, nobody got hurt, the Explosion was about 15 ft from a Belgian's Home &amp; some of the stones broke the slates on the Roof. I went along towards my Eng when another shell exploded at the side of me about 30 yds away &amp; just about 15 ft from our Coal stage between the lines it made a hole about 6 ft deep &amp; about 15 ft across. The dirt shot up in the Air &amp; a number of Chinaman were coaling an Engine &amp; they ran in all directions for cover &amp; the dirt fell all over them, a few minutes another one came over &amp; struck the Bank alongside of the Low Road &amp; blew the dirt all over our Cook House which was about 20 ft away, the Roof was covered with Sand &amp; the Officers Breakfast which was inside was spoilt by the dirt,
