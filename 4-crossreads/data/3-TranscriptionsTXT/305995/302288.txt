a glorious victory. Our prizes from this scrap included over two hundred camels, ammunition convoys, cachelots & another two thousand prisoners. We then rested from the night of the fifth & it was well deserved, for we had been in the saddle for sixteen consecutive nights & just snatching an hour or so sleep in the daytime. On the 6th August four taubes flew over our redoubts, dropping twenty odd bombs, killing fifteen & wounding thirty odd of our infantry.
Two days following, the 8th August, we were ordered to proceed to De Babbas, about eighteen miles east of our base to join up with the second light horse brigade, who continued trek to Bur el Abd & once more became engaged with the enemy. Here the fighting was quite as hot as we had at Romani & too much praise cannot be given to the second brigade, New Zealanders & the Ayrshire artillery for their work, under difficulties, when the enemy had the most advantageous position & also had our ranges to a nicety. The "C" squadron of the 6th regt. on the left flank held in check a battallion of Turks who were "sparring for an opening" & I saw them advancing with my own eyes marching on in three waves, about fifteen hundred all told,
