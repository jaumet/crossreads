Reached Tours at 6 PM for tea, and at 7 PM the train went off and left about 300 of us behind including most of the officers.  after it had gone about an hour we woke up to the fact that we were left behind, at 5 to 9 PM we went on in a special train to catch them, didn't catch them until 3 AM next morning 60 miles away, feeling very cold and sleepy, went straight to bed and never woke till 7 AM.
Thursday Jan 3rdStopped at Mezidon fro breakfast 8 AM, then went on the last stage of our railway journey across France, from here on very little snow had fallen, and the country looked more like our own, with its green pastures, sheep & cattle, nearly all the cows are of the Polled Angus variety, and they looked very fine & in good condition.  We also saw a couple of very fine cathedrals, just before we reached Cherbourgh, the country side is remarkably pretty with its trees,
