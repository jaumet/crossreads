<p>107<br/>Chantilly to day &ndash; the prettiest &amp; most homely of all the chateaux. As usual I stray from beaten tracks &amp; descend at Orry Coye.</p>
<p>We are very late starting owing to having spent night previous at Montmartre &amp; then to cap all having to take an omnibus train.</p>
<p>The forest of Coye lightly timbered &amp; yet completely shaded is a subject for a picture but what shall I say of the Pool &amp; Chateau of the Queen Blanche. The small tower situated over falling cascades on to a velvet <strike>carpet</strike> tree covered carpet while a view of the railway viaduct of 15 arches towering overheard.</p>
<p>The lake, down to edge of which the forest descend Coye on one side &amp;<br/>Chantilly on other though really the same forest, is fringed with a road &ndash; forest on one hand &amp; a hedge on the water side. Sunlight &amp; then a heavy shower followed by a mist rising from lake makes varied pictures</p>
<p>So enraptured are we by the scene that we dine on rising ground in view of lake &amp; chateau under an enormous elm &amp; though rain is heavy &amp; we have no macs we continue to dine well &amp; dry on chicken &amp; wine &amp; cheese &amp; cakes, while the million drops of gold splash on the gilded surface beneath us, &amp; the air is full of that sweet odour of woods after april shower.</p>
<p>This is the prettiest spot I found</p>
