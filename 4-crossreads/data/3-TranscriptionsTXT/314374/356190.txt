(6)Zoo (which contains the finest collection of African wild animals and snakes in the world).  Surfing on the fine beaches was a delight, especially as the weather was very hot.
I went to the "Messiah" in the Town Hall, and saw, in the Museum, the German flag that General Botha hauled down, when he captured German East Africa.  The niggers (Kaffirs) here are in the majority and are kept in their places by the whites.  They are only allowed to walk on the footpaths in certain parts of the city (must keep to the streets) and only allowed to travel on the four back seats of trams.  A common notice to see up over shops, resturants, theatres &amp;c is "Europeans only admitted".  The natives do great business with their rickshas, and for sixpence we could get a ricksha ride all over the city.  The ricksha men are fine big chaps.  They paint their bodies (only have a loin cloth on) with various designs and have a large head dress of horns and feathers.  When pulling a ricksha along, they rear up and shy at other rickshas, just like horses.
We left Durban on 22nd Decr., accompanied by the transports "Port Napier" and "Hororato".  We followed close to the coast, passing East London and Port Elizabeth.  Passed over the spot where the "Waratah" was lost with all its hands.  Spent Christmas Day at sea and had a good dinner supplied by the Australian Comforts Fund.  Entered Table Bay at daylight on Boxing Day and was lucky to see Table Mountain in all its grandeur and beauty.  Table Mountain was covered with white clouds which gave it the appearance of a huge table covered with a white cloth &ndash; hence its name.  We tied up at the docks and had the day free in Capetown.  This is the oldest city of South Africa and very interesting.  The people are mostly of Dutch descent.  The city is not so up-to-date as Durban and the niggers are not so plentiful either &ndash; there are no rickshas.  Saw all the interesting sights &ndash; the Museum containing the Boer War relics, the Cathedral (which contains a book in which are written the names of every soldier who died fighting for the Empire in the Boer War), Rhodes Monument &amp;c &amp;c.  When one is walking down the main street of Capetown if you look up, Table Mountain appears to be right on top of one hanging over the street, whereas it is many miles away.  Fruit was plentiful here and we got well stocked up.  Several other Australian troopships were also in the Harbour.  Whilst we were here a troopship laden with English soldiers from German East Africa arrived in port and it was pitiful to see the men, most of whom were suffering from malaria and other tropical diseases.
On 27th Decr., seven troopships, ("Kyarra", "Wanganui", "Tahiti", Hororato", "Suevic", "Beltana" and "Borda") escorted by H.M.S. "Glasgow" left Capetown.  It was a fine sight to see us all steaming together.  The warship was ahead, then the "Kyarra" &ndash; we were the slowest &ndash; then three on either side about two hundred yards apart and we kept in this position until we arrived in the English Channel &ndash; three weeks later.
All sorts of rumours were now going round.  Some said that we were going North to Egypt, others that we were bound for Nova Scotia
