  
 The famous 6th is nearly all split up & a tremendous lot of them have now got commissions in other branches mostly in the Infantry.  I heard delightful stories of them all, Alison, Sandy Jacques, young Hardy, Street, Reynolds, Lamrock, McKeown, Hasty A'beckett, Macaush, all of whom I knew & very many others.  Weary & Sandy were the wits of the party & kept them continually amused, Weary in particular, he grew as you know a huge red beard, wore a blue singlet & very abreviated shorts & they called him Jesus Christ from his resemblance to  the  his pictures.  of that   One night at Lone Pine when he was on guard duty when rations were particularly short  the Adjutant  & Weary who was always hungry was particularly so the Adjutant was doing night rounds & when he got to Alison was pulled up there.  Halt!  Who goes there? 
 Friend! 
 Advance friend & give the Counter Lunch! 
 The Adjutant who had to reprove him did so very leniently & was finally overcome by the humor of it all, the stories are numberless of them all. 
 It is my very great regret that I did not get over in time to get to the Peninsular, in future years in Australia it is going to be a hall mark, & even now there is a feeling of comradeship amongst those who were there at any time, no matter if only for 36 hours, that is very noticeable & which will in future become more marked, I feel quite an intruder & outsider amongst them all.
