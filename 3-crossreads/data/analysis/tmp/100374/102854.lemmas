June 24 Sun.Two Taub were brought down by our plane one at 4.45a.m and one at 10 a.m. The latter look a mere speck in the sky , and was fli rapid away from our Anti Air craft shell . Sudden it seem to stop and fell just like a feather fall from the sky till it reach a few hundr feet from the ground . One expect everi minut to hear the machin crash to the ground but it sudden right itself again and fell slowli to earth . It is said that this machin fell into our aerodrom but befor it could be captur , he mount again , but I believ he had to come down near Poperhing It was marvel to see how our ?plane came from all direct when this plane fell . They seem to hem him in on all side and a few minut previous we could onli see the one ?plane which was fall We had a brass band from one of the battalion play in our ground for the benefit of the patient The extra staff which we got attach to us for the Messin Stunt have been gradual leav us late , so much so that now they have near all depart .

Was at the 7th F.A. Be told that there are about 30 tank in a field near here we set out to find them . After a good deal of wander about we came across them in a wood . There was a guard over them and they were all cover with camouflag . To look at them they gave one the impress of sleep lion . In this wood there were numer trench which must have been made earli in the campaign as they were all overgrown with foliag . In the distanc we could see Messin ridg . The villag of Neuv Eglise is terribl smash . There is scarc a whole hous in the place . Were fortun in get a lift in Motor Transport both way . Fritz had appar been tri to get on to Bailleul as just outsid the town there were mark of recent dropt shell . Juli 2nd . Mon.A bomb was drop in the " Rue Muse " just by the side of the C.C.S. I thought our build was go to collaps . The vibrat was someth terrif The pit , pit , pit , of the machin gun could be heard overhead . Our aeroplan were chase the bomber in the semi dark He was fli veri low . An English Officer , a chap about twenti year of age , was brought into the Operat Theatr with his arm blown off from the socket as a result of the bomb which was drop . Apparent this bomb was meant to be drop on the Officer Club as it drop onli about forti yard from there . Had it drop on this Officer Club , it would have got a few as this club is alway full . Juli 4th . Wed . Went round to the Rue Muse to see the damag by the bomb drop the previous night At the place where the bomb had drop there was a deep hole which had penetr through the stone block of the street . On either side of the street the hous were bad damag and for a hundr yard up and down the street there was scarc a whole pane of glass in the window . Juli 4th . Wed.A bomb was drop by an enemi ?plane in amongst our tent at the back of the build . We had heard the ?plane buzz about all night . One of the sister who was on night duti was slight wound on the shoulder . She was oper on but the Surgeon was unsuccess in get the small piec of metal . The piec of metal had appar penetr the lung . [ Note in left hand side margin side , written later : ] This sister got the M.M. for this She was the first nurs to receiv this honour . Juli 6th . Fri.Rumour that in our next stunt there are to be nine Operat Team . About 10 o'clock to-night the sound of numer ?plane was heard up in the air . They shower numer light of various colour appar as signal to each other . There is a great deal of traffic go through the street to-night They are heavi artilleri drawn by caterpillar engin Heard the sound of Taub up in the air to-night and soon afterward the explos of bomb were heard near by . This continu dure the night . The night was beauti and moonlight . The ?plane appar are work in relay . One come over , circl around , drop his bomb and off he goe and there is silenc , short afterward the faint buzz is heard again , then grow louder and louder till he appear to be just about our head but no bomb were drop on our head . The bomb drop were much heavier stuff that we have been use to , judg from the sound of the explos . As a result of Fritz 's perambul an Officer and three chap were brought in to the C.C.S. wound . One of the chap die befor anyth could be done for him . The P.B. attach to us got quit a shock when Fritz came over last night . After come off duti this afternmorn four of us went out to town to see what damag had been done . A huge bomb had drop in Rue de Lill caus a big hole in the street and damag the hous on either side . Judg from the damag done there must have been a number of civilian kill Those of the civilian who had remain in their home seem to find relief for their overcharg nerv in clear away the debri which had been made by the explos . Look insid some of the hous one could see that they were well furnish . Numer small group of French peopl had gather and were discuss thing in a subdu and anxious tone . We made our way to the Aerodrom . There we saw the debri of an aeroplan . This ?plane had by some mean or other drop on to the roof of a small cottag in the endeavour to land at the Aerodrom . It had carri away the chimney and part of the roof of the cottag . None of the aviat were injur but the machin was like a huge umbrella which had been blown outsid in by the wind . We next went round to the R.N.A.S. Aerodrom and saw six Triplan rise from the ground . They seem wonder machin Left C.G. at the Aerodrom , he be anxious to join the fli corp want some inform on the matter as to examin to pass etc . We walk along the railway , pass the side where the ammunit train was blown up , till we reach No 11 C.C.S. The morn was beauti , the sun was shine bright with a tendenc to be hot , a slight haze was on the hill , the bird are sing languid amongst the thick green foliag of the tree , the grow crop and green pastur all help to make the world beauti to behold . As I was walk along the railway I happen to turn round and there I saw glitter in the sun a few thousand white wooden cross mark the spot of the burial place of as mani men . Make enquiri at No 11 as to ani damag be done dure the night we were told that 28 men had been kill and sixti wound by bomb that were drop last night . Go down to the part of the hospit where the bomb had drop we found a terribl mess . It look as if Fritz had drop all his bomb more or less in the one spot huge hole mark the spot where bomb had drop , men were busi clean away the debri . Rather a strang thing was that the hospit was extra full owe to there not be ani evacu the previous day . The ambul train had fail to turn up . Had it turn up all right most of those chap who were kill or wound would have been away down to the base out of the danger zone On the road back to our station there were mani larg gun which were be drawn by caterpillar engin . They were hidden as much as possibl by the border of tree which line the roadway . The probabl is , that these are what Fritz was after when he drop his bomb . Juli 12th . Thurs.A few shell drop near the C.C.S. to-day . Blew some of the civilian to smithereen Juli 13th . FriA few more shell sent over this morn . Stop receiv until further notic . One drop in the middl of the street near the division bath and at the place where the Amb M Car stand . As W I and I were walk along the street we stop to watch a quaint funer which was pass , when sudden the loud report of a heavi gun fire was heard . The women at the funer duck into a lane , as the whiz of the shell sound overhead . A few women were run along the street and onli stop for a minut or two to make anxious inquiri as to the place where the shell had burst . A bright spot in rather anxious time was to see a women who seem to be a schoolmistress put her head out of the door of a hous , and then immedi after she had withdrawn her head we saw about fifti children , all veri young scurri down the street quit delight at the shell becaus they had got a day off from school . They scatter down the street make for their home laugh and joke as they went . As we reach the squar we saw men , women , and children run in all direct make for a place of safeti . The shelter under the Hotel de vill was crowd with peopl . The gun which is send over the shell must be on an armour train . Sometim the report of the gun are veri loud and then they get fainter and fainter which mean , in some other town , further away the same scene that we are wit here are be enact some other place . This even W an I went to the Y.M.C.A. pictur . We had no sooner seat ourselv when .C. who was sit behind us told me that they had been call out my name in the pictur hous as I was want back at the station . When I got back to the C.C.S.

Just when the Gotha seem to have got full control of the fight he mount up into air the majest and soar away up into the heaven and was lost to view . We stood and watch this fight , which meant life or death to the fighter , as if we were watch a footbal match and expect everi minut to see a goal score .

The litter of young pig especi be point out to us by the younger children Later we went into the garden to gather some fruit . While there we heard a sudden crash and look round away about a hundr yard in the next field I could see the top of a plane as it toppl over . Without a moment hesit we bolt to the upturn ?plane . Our excit was so great , that , instead of open the narrow gate into the field , a thing that would have been veri easi to do we jump right over it . The stupid of our action in do this struck even the slow mind servant of the farm , Emma , who spoke to us about it afterward . When we reach the ?plane we found one of the aviat pin underneath it and groan consider . The other chap , the observ , was lie about thirti feet away and unconsci . We lift the machin , and cut the strap which held the pilot in we freed him from his peril posit . He was bleed profus but we learn afterward that he had onli a slight cut on his face . The other chap though unconsci was not veri bad injur but he had a bullet through his foot . It appear that they had been over Lill take observ and of cours had a rough time from Fritz 's Anti Air Craft , so much so that the observ got a piec of metal through the heel of his boot and right through his foot . While up in the ?plane he had lost a good deal of blood and the pilot learn this and see our C.C.S. mark out with a huge Red Cross thought he would land near the hospit with his mate . In land in the field , appar his machin had tilt a littl , the result was that the propel caught in the ground and the machin turn a complet somersault , pin the pilot underneath , and send the observ through the air probabl land him on his head for when I found him he was breath stentor and unconsci Sept 11th .
