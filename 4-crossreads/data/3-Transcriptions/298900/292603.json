<p>tucked away in Soho, finishing up at Pamela at the Palace a very good show on revue lines with Lily Elsie &amp; G.P. Huntley in the leading parts.   Bertie Adams, an Australian Girl I met here in 1914 also had a good part, she having advanced well in the profession.    Supper at [indecipherable] &amp; missed tube so walked home, about 3 miles.   Sent a cable to Australia telling of my leave during the day.   Had lunch at the Bun House Holborn an old resort of mine of prewar days.</p>
<p>Wednesday 2nd January<br/>   Decided on my future movements which were to go to Glasgow tonight &amp; return on Sunday to London after calling at Birmingham.   Sent off a telegram to Glasgow  &amp; and wrote to Elliston then took a taxi to Bunton &amp;so to  NottingHill for lunch then to the Matinee of "When Knights were bold" quite the funniest play I have ever seen.   I laughed till I cried &amp; felt quite tired out when it was all over, Challener being the mirth medium at the Kingway Theatre.</p>
