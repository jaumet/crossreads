  
 Friday 24th Dec To-day we shifted our Baggage etc round to Sarpi Pier. It was a long journey & we had 2 wagons & I understand we are to go on to a Transport at any moment. We made another covering to sleep in with baggage all around us. I was still a little off color but I was getting better each day. I omitted to mention I had to go to The Hospital here to see what was wrong a few days ago. It was Xmas Eve & a quiet one. On the Harbour in the distance we could hear carol singing but it hardly cheered me. 
 Saturday 25th Dec To-day was warmer & an ideal Xmas Day. I was indisposed & cold not look at dinner, cooked in the evening. I went up to see Dr McCardle & got a prescription.
