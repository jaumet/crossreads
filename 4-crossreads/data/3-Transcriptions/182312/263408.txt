<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-4-</p>
<p>side of the Cunarder &quot;Saxonia&quot; on which vessel we embarked. &nbsp;She short-</p>
<p>ly afterwards moved out into the harbour and anchored for the night&nbsp;</p>
<p>so as to allow us to organise the troops before venturing out into</p>
<p>the submarine area, and as we had 3,500 men aboard this took some</p>
<p>doing. &nbsp;3,500 men does not sound much, but when you get them on a&nbsp;</p>
<p>ship - even a 15,000 tonner like the &quot;Saxonia&quot; - you will find that</p>
<p>they have to pack together like passengers on the Ferry Boats during</p>
<p>the busy hours. &nbsp;Everything being made ship-shape we put to sea the</p>
<p>following morning about breakfast time. &nbsp;The men had been told off</p>
<p>to their life boats or rafts and deck spaces were allotted where</p>
<p>the men were to parade on an alarm being given. &nbsp;These alarms were&nbsp;</p>
<p>given at least twice a day to get the men used to their positions</p>
<p>and so avoid confusion and panic should real danger threaten, in</p>
<p>fact them men never knew but what each alarm might be a genuine one.</p>
<p>Life belts were worn the whole time, but officers were allowed to&nbsp;</p>
<p>take theirs off whilst messing, but had to hang them over their</p>
<p>chairs. &nbsp;The only time the men took theirs off was when they went</p>
<p>to bed and then they were compelled to use them as pillows so as to</p>
<p>be in readiness. &nbsp;We had one night alarm - about 10 o&#39;clock one night</p>
<p>and our Company was the first to report &quot;All present and correct&nbsp;</p>
<p>on alarm station&quot;, the time being 12 minutes. &nbsp;When you consider</p>
<p>that the ship was in absolute darkness and also the narrow stair-</p>
<p>ways leading up from below, 12 minutes was quite a good performance.</p>
<p>There were numerous minor casualties through men falling over winches,&nbsp;</p>
<p>steampipes etc. in the dark, but nothing serious. &nbsp;Notices were</p>
<p>posted up warning men that should anyone fall overboard the ship</p>
<p>would not be stopped as by doing so, she would be a target for</p>
<p>submarines and the lives of 3000 odd would not be risked for the sake</p>
