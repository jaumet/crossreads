<p>December 28<br/>56.<br/>This morning bombs dropped and the raiders away without harm.  If they were as near as they sounded they'd have been much nearer.</p>
<p>All night long heavy and heavier intervals of fire, and till mid morning they've continued. Tonight the 1st Brigade are stunting &ndash; either a raid on a large scale or a minor stunt.  This is a quiet front &ndash; the quietest we've been on this year. It has been well accepted that the Boche will sooner or later make some attack &ndash; an effort to break through.  The idea is that this will be his attacking front, and today big preparations have been made for the clearing of wounded.  'Tonight's the night'.</p>
<p>Afternoon:  stunt postponed, an 11th Batt. runner captured with all plans and arrangements of the attack.</p>
