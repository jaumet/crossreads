<p>Everybody is in the best of spirits and joking &amp; singing in the troop deck.</p>
<p>26th Apr 1915. 12.30 a m. Still on board, though B &amp; C Coys have gone. For the last three hours firing has been <strike>fi</strike> very fierce over the hill at periods of 20 minutes or so, and the distant rattle of musketry is making everybody very keen on getting to it. Evidently the Turks are making terrific efforts to regain their lost ground. Over to the right one warship keeps sweeping one patch of ground with a searchlight, backwards &amp; forwards always over the same area. This is a place where the big guns were firing this afternoon, and there is evidently a <strike>battle there</strike> battery or so there. Interspersed with the rattle of musketry is the more continuous roll of machine guns, but whether our own or the Turks it is impossible to say. Amongst the men is a sort of suppressed feeling of excitement, but there is much chaff about cold feet, and in one corner of the troop deck one group playing cards are apparently oblivious of everything but their losses &amp; gains.</p>
