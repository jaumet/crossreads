Wed 17thWe had a kit inspection this morning & had to give a list of all shortages.  I applied for a pair of legging again, as I am still wearing a pair of Billy Robinson's that I borrowed on the boat (as I lost mine on the "Star")We had a very easy morning after dinner we were on helio practice & went to Cairo with Stan & Sergeant Matheson after tea & attended a French lesson (given by an American lady) in the Methodist Church a concert was held after the French lesson was finished & we had a very enjoyable evening
