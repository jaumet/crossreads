<p>Another few lines<br/>I met young Jack Walker here (Bessies brother)  &amp; he wishes to be remembered to you. Bessie married Fred Blackett from Blacktown. I suppose you remember them. (the Blacketts) She had a son born  <strike>or</strike> on our anniversary (April 15) We had a great old yarn  &amp; I found out from him Ross Jones' address but don't suppose I will see him as he is in London  &amp; I have had my furlough. We are having bad weather again. Last week was like a week in our winter. Sun, Mon, &amp; yesterday were real summer days again but today it is   <strike>[indecipherable]</strike>  teeming again  &amp; pretty cold too. If the weather was as dry as I am for news well there would be no rain. Have met Rowley Jones here (my mate in camp. He came over on same boat and took on a dental job) Have had a pretty fair time with him but it is awfully slow here after Weymouth. Well dear once more good-bye &amp; tons of love &amp; kisses from Hal</p>
