<p>1917<br/>March<br/>several people we at last reached Westminster near the Houses of Parliament.   They asked us to meet them on Sunday in Hyde Park, and we put them into their Underground for Hammersmith (or somewhere out that way), and we went back to Waterloo.   We had to take a shake-down in the Annexe as the Club was full and we had not booked far enough ahead.   About 4 am the next morning a man came in with a wheezy concertina with one note, and woke us all up.   He called out a long string of names of men, mostly Canadians, who were wanted back at their Battalions &ndash; I think there was a bit of a push on about this time &ndash; Our names were not amongst them so we went to sleep again.   Next morning we went to the Zoo, walking through Regents Park and seeing the squirrels hopping about on the seats.<br/>The Zoo was free to soldiers.  (remarkable thing for London.)   We were not much impressed.   The day was cold and the majority of the animals were in their dugouts</p>
