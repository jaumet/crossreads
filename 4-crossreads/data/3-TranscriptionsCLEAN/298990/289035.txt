Ypres  11/10/16  Awakened after an unsettled sleep by the CO coming in to the dug out and remember saying "Good morning!  What's the time".  He replied "Between 4 and 5, I have compared the two Intelligence Summaries!"  After dozing for a few minutes I got up and dressed and on reaching the dugout they stared at me in amazement as it was only half past 2.  The whole incident of the conversation was an hallucination or the effect of an exceptionally vivid dream. The C.O. had certainly entered the dugout but had not spoken nor had I.  Subconscious mind.  Remained up and yarned until 4.30 when he went the rounds.   Signed the intelligence summary.  We go out tonight and raid is postponed pro tem!  Went back to bed after breakfast and slept until 12.30.  A very quiet day and beyond putting a few 77's in our front line the Bosche kept quiet.  The  CO of 23rd arrived about 7 pm and I set off with a runner &  Hun for Ypres.  The country is well pitted with shell holes mostly old.  A couple of shells passed overhead and burst in the town.  This is a good example of a walled city.  Beyond the city wall there are no houses but once inside you find them jammed right up to the ramparts.  The moat is wide and full of mud and rushes.  There is a fine church in ruins.  Reached billets and found the mens' quarters in a most filthy condition with foodstuffs and rubbish. Furphey: That we follow the first Div to St. Omer and spend 6 weeks in rest there do a stint on the Somme and then garrison Southern France during the winter.
12/10/16  In Ypres billets quiet day.  In the evening went out to the rear of gaol and laid out some practice trenches for raid - a few Hun shells.  At 5.15 pm he dropped 3 4.5 H.E's into our billet at Hospital Notre Dame killing 1 man wounding 2.  The dead man Dawson received an almost direct hit and was nearly blown to pieces.  The head was intact with a portion of the body and the pieces took a lot of gathering up.  Turned down proposal to bury him beside other graves in backyard and told Pioneers to put remains in a bag and carry to cemetery.  Went to Baths but no one in attendance.  At 6.30 pm our artillery started intense shelling for a raid by 7th Bde.
