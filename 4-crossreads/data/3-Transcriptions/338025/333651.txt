<p>Tuesday 3rd April 1917<br/>Grooming and cleaning harnesses all day.<br/>Paid 40 franks<br/>Pozieres (cont)<br/>by dozens from the little 12 pounder up to the immense 15 inch. You stumble through barbed wire (some of it German with sharp iron spikes put in the ground under it). When you arrive at Pozieres you would not think that at one time it was a peaceful village. All that is left is heaps of bricks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and timber, and all the trees has been blown to pieces by shell fire.<br/>1st Div. took Pozieres<br/>2nd Div. held it.</p>
