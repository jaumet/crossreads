 France 12.1.17 My dear Father &amp; Mother, 
 This is really the first chance I've had of sending anything like a letter since leaving England &ndash; Have been mostly on the move, and not the most pleasant thing in the world this weather. Troop trains which travel about 6 inches an hour, and mostly minus their windows are not conducive to comfortable travelling &ndash; However, I have managed to exist so far. Am at present at the Base Depot at Etaples, and leave again tomorrow for Amiens, and from there by horse up to the Battery which is in the line near Peronne &ndash; Will be heartily glad to be back in harness again &ndash; This moving about is very boring work &ndash;
