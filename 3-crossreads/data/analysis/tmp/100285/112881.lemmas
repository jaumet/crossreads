 I do n't care now how soon I get back to Franc now Len has gone , for there noth much of interest to me round here now . On our way home Lindsay I pick up Bill Graham the 3 of us went in to the 1st T.B. look for Digbi who had just return from his 6 month leav in Australia , we found him he told us all about his experi reckon they had a rotten time for the first 6 week no one would recognis them , but after they were found out they had a glorious holiday , I am jolli glad I did not get away now for we have our leav in front thing will be in run order when we get to Aussi so there will be no delay it was the same when first I came to England on the Cadr last year
