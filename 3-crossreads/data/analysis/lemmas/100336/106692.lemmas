Howev we got over without be seen and after climb a steep rocki hill we sat down and had a good rest , wet through with perspir After half an hour rest we move off again and after go a mile I discov that I had left an acytelin lamp behind where we had rest . We had this lamp made so that we would be abl to signal from the coast it was useless go back to look for it as the countri was so rough so after much swear we move off again . The countri here was veri rough so we had to keep rest about . midnight we came to a deep gulli .
