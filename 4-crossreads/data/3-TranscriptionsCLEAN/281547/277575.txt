  
 several Ostrich's feathers and the Lady picking them out for me  als  as I was no judge of Feather's and I wanted to obtain suitable one's for my Wife, her Sister and their Mother also a Silver Chain Necklet and Broach for my Daughter, a little later I left my friends and went along to the Waverley Restaurant and had a good Dinner and left my Parcels in their care until returning in the Evening, and then met my chum at 2 Pm at the Post Office, and started out on a ramble, first taking a Tram and going up towards the Zoo and along Musgrave Road, having a beautiful View of the Town below and the harbour also the Racecourse, as the Weather was very clear it was a treat passing through the Residential portions of Durban enroute, on arrival back we went into the Wesley Hall were Ladies served us with Fruit and cakes and sandwiches of Tomatoe's and Water Cress which I enjoyed very much, the Boys patronised this Hall likewise the West St Hut in large numbers all day, they make the Boys very welcome and see that they want for nothing in the way of Food. After signing the Visitor's Book in the Hall, we boarded a Tram, & went along to the Beach and promenaded along the Pier which was crowded with Visitor's from up Country, also numbers were in Surf Bathing. Ladies and Gentlemen, it was very amusing watching the Bather's in the heavy Breaker's enjoying themselves, we returned at 6 Pm for Tea and a little later went back to the Beach and spent the Evening strolling about, listening to the Band playing in the "Rotunda". We were getting tired of our wanderings and at 9 Pm made for the Boat after a light Supper and turned in.
