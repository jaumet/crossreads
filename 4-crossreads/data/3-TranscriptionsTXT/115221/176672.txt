 Dear Miss Clark 
 Miss Warner has written to me telling me of your kindness to her during the week end which she spent at your home, and she said that you would like a letter from me about what I am doing.  Well here goes for a few lines.  At present I am in charge till Tuesday next of the catarrhal Camp here.  I have only 10 men in at present and the job is fairly easy, but all the same I will be glad when I get back to my section.  I have to take these 10 men for Medicine at 9 a.m., 2 p.m. or 4.5 p.m. &amp; 7.30 p.m.  They all have sore throats, but are a decent lot.  Last Monday &amp; Tuesday week we were at the Range doing Musketry.  On the Monday I did not do well at all, but on the Tuesday I did very well and when I shoot for the qualifying Exam I hope to get my Marksmen's Badge.  I can always do better at 3 &amp; 400 yds that at 200 yds.  Tomorrow 3 Pals &amp; I are going to Melbourne for the week end and we are invited to an evening and promised a good time.  Melbourne is not too bad
