A Tommy sniped just outside Eaton Hall at 10 am - Only had a few casualtys.
15/8/16  Tuesday
Raining off & on. As our Ambulance was recommended for special notice & one medal was alotted to H. Ramsden today, it is the Military Cross. I have referred to Harry back during the stunt. Forgot to mention the King & Prince of Wales passed thro Sailly - I would know him from his photo antwhere. Put in a wretched night down in saps - only one casualty, but the shrapnel - whiz bang, etc fairly got my nerves. 2 Fellows killed outright.
16th  Wednesday
Dull & raining - mud is the order of the day & it is hard work stretcher bearing. My self and Dick Deshorn went up to the firing line about daylight - I had a couple of shots & hope they had good effect. Rumours that the King said we were going to winter in Ireland, etc.
