 July 18th 1919 
 Dear Mick 
 Above note was put down the other day, comment is that said Elwell's sister I believe was a friend of yours anyhow he is a nice man &amp; knows all about your family &amp; also Waddells in Cairns.  He is a rather fine well set up well bred looking man &amp; has a good reputation as an Officer in A.I.F. 
 Another meeting which I don't think I mentioned was Marguerite Ussher in Port Said what time I was saying farewell to General Chaytor.  Marguerite was looking quite smart &amp; collected &amp; promised to see you &amp; give you un-camuflaged information as to my health.
