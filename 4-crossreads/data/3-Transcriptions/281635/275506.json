<p>Renfrew by train running practically parallel to Clyde River. Passed en route Fairfield Ship building yards &amp; Harland &amp; Wolfs. Raining all morning. Had lunch at a restaurant about 12 noon then went to Central Stn &amp; got a London train leaving at 1pm. Travelled via Motherwell, Wishaw South, Carluke, Carstairs, Lockerbie, Gretna, Carlisle, Wreay, Penrith, Shap, to Oxenholme. Was told to change at this place for Barrow as train now misses connection at Carnforth so did so. Porters sent me to booking office to get my ticket for Barrow &amp; clerk was so slow that I missed the train. Found would</p>
