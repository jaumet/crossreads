<p>our Pioneer party found a tunnell bored right from the turks line extending out behind our lines this they say is where the spies come from to &amp; fro, the next one that comes through will get a hot time. Kitchener has been with us and put a lot of heart into the boy&#39;s, he impressed the Australians a good deal he had a big staff with him and if they carry 1/4 the brains he has they ought finish off this bally war soon. they are going to Yank out an Indian at dawn to be shot he has it is stated given away a lot of useful secrets, this I dont think can be avoided as the working parties who work on the beach are a mixed lot, Egyptians Maltesse and half breeds, so it is not strange that a lot of important matters are divulged. another rumor of the speel we are getting but it is not concreate enough to take any notice extra blankets given out and we want them too the weather has been very severe and we had a few days of snow. Yellow Juandice still continues, I think I will be going&nbsp;</p>
