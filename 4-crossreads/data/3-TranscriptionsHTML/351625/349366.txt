<p>I have 4 watches, a N.C.O's dagger &amp; little revolver &amp; a broken pair of field glasses, the latter were a beautiful pair but a bit of shell hit them up the line.  I am sending you a cable today, I hope you get it alright.  I sent several from France, I hope you got some of them, also the parcel of souvenirs I sent from there.</p>
<p>How much money have I in the bank.  I wont have to send for any for leave as I have nearly &pound;30 in my pay book.  Tucker is very short here like all</p>
