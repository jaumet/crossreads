I can tell you it does not go far here, & it is essential to save some for possible leave en route.'Five hundred' is getting the fashionable game aboard now. Last night a chap in my section - Bob Bydder - & I played two others. One game ran out to about 20 hands & ended with us out & the opponents about 1600 behind (-minus)  The following game ended at 'lights out' with both sides minus - they 600, we 790. We are satisfied that it cuts out time better than chess - when the play goes like that!
Now I'm going to shoot this along to the censor-censorious - hys - sanctum-sanctorium .
With much love from Harry.
