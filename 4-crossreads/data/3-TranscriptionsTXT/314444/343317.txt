 At 1 a.m. on Monday we saddled up &amp; moved off to the attack.  This Brigade (2nd) was given the post of honor &amp; we had to make a big detour to South East in order to get round to the East of the city to prevent a retreat &amp; to stop Turkish reinforcements coming up.  It was a ticklish job &amp; risky &amp; according to German Officers (captured) a move they did not count on as they thought no troops would attempt to get into such a dangerous position &amp; even if they did would never get out again. 
 Yet we got in &amp; got out too, the latter by the skin of our teeth.  We  were  had their main position in front of us &amp; 13,000 Turkish reinforcements advancing from behind us.

It was a great race, lasted some time &amp; our lads won in the finish.  The quarry turned out to be a  Austrian  German General &amp; his staff including an Austrian Colonel &amp; others; travelling in two coaches.  They had been on their way from Beer Sheba to Gaza, &amp; were to take over the command of the troops at the latter place, against our attack.
