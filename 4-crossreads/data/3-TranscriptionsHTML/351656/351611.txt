<p>My dear Mrs Robertson</p>
<p>I have got a crack at last &amp; a rather nasty one but one is lucky to come out alive after two efforts in the "big push".  After the first stunt, the taking of Pozieres, I got a Military Cross &amp; my Captaincy &amp; went back to 11th Battalion as Company Commander.  The second stunt I got shot thro' the knee by a sniper.  Have got a compound fracture of the femur &amp; will have a stiff leg, which I expect I shall get used to after a while.  I was wounded 22nd August, a week today &amp; have had a lot of pain, but expect it will ease off gradually.  Expect to get shifted to England within a month.  Hope Alison is all right.  Haven't heard of him since the Turkish attack.  Had one just</p>
