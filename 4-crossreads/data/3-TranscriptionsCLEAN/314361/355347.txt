to leave Egypt.There were about 6 letters from Lou, & about ten from home waiting for me at the bn.June 9th 16 Ferry PostHave not left the Post yet. Think we shall be on SundayHave had some very hot weather, but it does not keep up for long, to day has been warm, but delightful, & the nights are cool especially in the early mornings. We rise at 5 Am. breakfast 5.30, first parade 6.15 to 10 second parade [11?] to 5 Pm.We get a first rate hunger here, breakfast generally is one slice of bread & jam sometimes there is bacon & occasionally rice, which is really rice & sand, then [indecipherable] we get another piece of bread & marmalade, about twice a week there is some soup & occasionally again we get prunes or dates. For tea which is the only decent meal we have stew & sometimes rice. Still I feel first rate, & have now some money to spend at the canteen.Thursday 15th 16.Ferry PostHeat Terrific. Believe that we are leaving tomorrow for Moascar, hope so for
