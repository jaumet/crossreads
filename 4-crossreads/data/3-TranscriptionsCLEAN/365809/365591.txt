 We are expecting several visits from the Boche during the next 10 days, unless the weather continues as bad as it is at present. 
 On Saturday I attended the investiture  and received my C.M.G.  H.M. was most gracious, and talked to me for quite a long time. I was beastly nervous, and gripped him by the hand hard, and what with my gammy leg etc, made generally a very inglorious exit. 
 I spent the weekend at Eton - my old school - and had a very happy time seing relations now at the school, and renewing old acquaintances in the masters - Please remember me to Mrs. Ferguson and to to Keith. Yours  sincerely Charles.M.Macnaghten
