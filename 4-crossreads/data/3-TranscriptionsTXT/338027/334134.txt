Saturday, 13 February, 1915Reinforcements are now allotted to each section.  One of the horse transports coming with the 2nd contingent caught fire at Albany and all the horses had to be taken off and another boat sent to Sydney for.
Half holiday in the p.m I went into Cairo to my English friends house to tea, afterwards went to an English dance and had a splendid time, arrived home just before the sergeant was handing the passes in.  The Terriers [Territorial Army] behaviour in Cairo is not of the best, there are a lot of cockney scum amongst them, and they are like a lot of school boys in their ways.
Sunday, 14 February, 1915Went to Presbyterian C.P [Church Parade] in the morning to hear Col Plane he is a fine preacher.  Some of the bands are very good now and play at all church parades.  Wrote home all the p.m. sent present to E.  At night I went into Heliopolis to Luna Park and knocked out some fun it is not nearly as good or big as Melb. but the soldiers made fun out of it.  Everywhere as it is all over Cairo the Khaki was conspicuous.  The Joy wheel was about the funniest thing I ever saw as soon as a Territorial got on a N.Z. would pull him off and then an Aust would pull him off and so.  We nearly upset the boat at the water shute as it struck the water.
