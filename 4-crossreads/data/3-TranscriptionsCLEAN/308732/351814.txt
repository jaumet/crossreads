  
 it has no sand at all, but is all small round waterworn stone, out on the sea, which is between here & France are numbers of vessels of all kinds, patrols, mine sweepers, & war boats, not to mention an observation baloon that is being towed along, by a small steamer, & a couple of sea-planes, all on the lookout for Fritz's tin fish. It is a beautiful day & I would like to have a walk round the city, as we are not leaving until some time this afternoon & have nothing to do except wait. I had better stop now, or I will have this little book filled in no time. 9 P.M. left Folkestone at 4 P.M. & had a good trip across on a small, fast boat named the "Victoria", it was packed with troops of all sorts, and was escorted by three destroyers, and there were patrol boats all the way across. We landed at Boulogne at 6 P.M.
