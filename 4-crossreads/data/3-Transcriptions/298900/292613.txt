<p>Square looking out for one of our cars to take us back to the camp.   Just as we had given up all hope one appeared and also gave us the news that the Sgts were having a dinner at Etaples that night.    The two officers told us that we could take the car along if we wished so they got off when about 3 kilos from the camp &amp; finished on foot and we continued on to Etaples.    The dinner had commenced and we received a great welcome as the others did not expect our return.   We soon caught up with the Courses and had a right royal time, the dinner being to commemorate 2 mentions, and a Meritorious Service Medal.   At 9 P.M. we finished up and returned to camp about 6 miles away when I received my mail which consisted of 22 letters 20 papers and one parcel.   It was a splendid finish up to our trip, the whole journey going off without a hitch.</p>
