<p>3 April 1915<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>The 4th Brigade gets marching orders but to our great disappointment the reinforcement's are to be left behind.<br/>But our range practices are cancelled so think there is a chance yet</p>
<p>1915 April 4<br/>Easter Day</p>
<p>Nothing to do all day with one of my cpls. visit the N.Z. Artillery   &amp;  examine the new Howitzers   &amp;  Field Guns<br/>They are all painted in patches of dark red yellow   &amp;  brown which makes them blend with the ground a lot better than any one color would.<br/>A very bad sand storm springs up at dusk</p>
