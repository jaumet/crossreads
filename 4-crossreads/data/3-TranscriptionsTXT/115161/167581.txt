 What we suffered during that day with our blistered heels, the terrible weight we carried, the awful mud we went through, can be imagined, perhaps. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; It was during this&nbsp;day that I first heard the guns, Only a &quot;boom, boom, boom,&quot;&nbsp;in the distance, but it gave a funny sensation. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; It was also during this day that I felt a decided itching on my legs and arms, could not account for it, but put it down to the marching making me so hot. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; Every mile we covered the &quot;boom, boom&quot; sounded closer, the weight I was carrying got heavier, my heels pained me more, and the irritation of my body became so pronounced that I could hardly bear the itching. Wondered what on earth it could be.

Where in an English garden you would find a lawn, in this part of France the lawn is substituted by a manure heap, sometimes reaching to the window of the living rooms. The people seem to like the smell of it, in fact they thrive and look well on it. What to an Englishman would mean typhoid, diptheria, and all kinds of loathsome and dangerous illnesses, to the Frenchmen spell good health, anyhow to the Frenchmen in these parts. Oh they were a dirty crowd.
