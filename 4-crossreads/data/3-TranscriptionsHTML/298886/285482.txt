<p>Cloudy most of the day. but about 5.30pm one of the most damnable dust storms we have ever experienced paid us a visit. It blew scarcely without intermission throughout the whole line long night. These dust storms are a caution Everything gets covered with fine black dust which for the most part comes from the banks of the Canals oh hell what a night! I only had about 2 hours sleep altogether The atmosphere too was hot. and most unpleasant</p>
