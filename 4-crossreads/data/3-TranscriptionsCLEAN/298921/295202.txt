  
 August, 1915 Thursday 19 No name of boat but news has just come in that 2600 Troopers drowned Mediterannean (Torpedoed)  Later  "Prince George" torpedoed - reinforcements from England - My difficulty is a Bath - Too many in bed to be washed so I get on my crutches & lay one across end of Bath & rest wounded leg on that as if I get dressing wet the Sisters growl - (but they are very good). Another trouble is few of the Pyjamas have any buttons or strings in Trousers -  Why the visitors don't bring needle & cotton & Bobkins instead of chattering away [indecipherable] just put string in with safety Pin & [indecipherable]
