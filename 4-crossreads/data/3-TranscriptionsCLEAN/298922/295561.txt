 Cairo [The following paragraph crossed through.] Still marking time. Nowell had dinner last night with me & he told me he had a Reinforcement to the Camels of a man by name TOM KIDNEY!!! who was educated at the Warrnambool College - that was a few years ago. Was it not Kidney who said he was late for School coz he had to stand "to attention" as the Band played God Save the Queen & so he missed his train!!  Mrs. Davis Red X superintendent is sending for me some BASKETS made from NILE REEDS by natives of ASSUAN, do you for Work Baskets etc. if you ever get them.
