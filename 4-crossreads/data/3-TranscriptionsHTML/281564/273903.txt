<p>Ruth, Ernie Flo  D.J.F.,A Schue.,E &amp; Alf.<br/>During the afternoon some of the men off the "Matanga" came out to the oupost &amp; photgraphed us for the Sydney "Mail"</p>
<p>The boat landed stores for two months. It brought news chief and of most interest was that Color sergeant L[indecipherable]     had been arrested in Rabaul on nine charges &amp; had been sent to Sydney with a "month" in view.</p>
<p>Monday 2nd  of Nov<br/>The "Matanga" sailed at three oclock. Shot another pig. This was a fine bit of excitement  We wandered along a narrow pig track into a scrub such as we had never seen before It was impossible to see a foot off the track. The luxuriance of the vegetation ,&amp; its rare beauty could be equalled in no other part of the world with the African &amp; Amazonian jungles taken into account. Although the place fairly stank of pig we could not see any coming out into the clearing. we ran into a number, however which took to their heels on out appearance. Hynes</p>
