  
 a charge to drive enemy back. Capt Lewis got shot in the chest just as I felt a flank fire & called a warning to him. The bullets & sand flew & we did some firing. I used the periscope a good deal & watched the shots our chaps made at times. The big gun got a couple more shots into the valley about 3 pm & also one or two on or near our trenches. She was supposed to have been silenced too. 
 Our chaps behaved jolly well I think & there were no signs
