 got a letter dated 2nd May from Dad August 10 Tuesday 1915 Working all day feeling well. A walk each morning along the Breakwater before breakfast is an exercise every man should take. It is very interesting to watch the sea rolling in &amp; dashing against the stone wall, sending spray high in the air, &amp; drenching any one likely to be walking even on the footpath. This breakwater is very necessary around Alexandra as the land is almost under sea level &amp; the great Wall of Cement is the only protection, against the whole city being washed away. 
 August 11 Wednesday 1915 Working all day, feeling well. News received of a General Advance at the Dardinelles. Many casualities anxiously waiting to hear how the 6th Reg. fared. Net fishing over the breakwater is a most exciting experience. The natives have to contend with the back wash &amp; though the water is not deep, the force of the waves drive the natives out &amp; keeps them not only wet but in agony lest the fish should escape whilst they struggle to pick them from the net. The fish here are very sweet &amp; lovely to eat.
