<p>Weigh anchor, &amp; depart from Alexandria at 10 a.m.<br/>Dense fog settled on harbour from sea just at sailing time. Steam slowly out on wake of S.S. Scotian which is to be our consort for voyage. <br/>Sea as calm as proverbial lake. Fog lifted about mid-day.<br/>To bed early on deck. No lights visible, life belts issued to each man, ordered to wear them day &amp; sleep with them by night. Boat takes zig-zag course changing every 4 miles in order to dodge likely submarines. Strong guards &amp; look out posted all over ship.</p>
