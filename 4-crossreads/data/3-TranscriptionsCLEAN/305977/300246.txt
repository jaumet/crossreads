August 1915at Suvla Bay
Saturday 7thThe bombardment still continues at 10.30 it was one continuous roar.  Achi Baba was the principle object & the peninsular looked as if it was in a dust storm.  In the afternoon we rowed out to the transport Tringa & got some stores.  The RNA Service were on board & they treated us well, gave us tobacco etc.  The night was fairly cool.  A destroyer brought in a load of Turkish prisoners about 500
Sunday 8thThere was no service this morning.  The minister was too busy with the casualties of which there are many.  There was more severe fighting at Anzac at night & more men were landed at Suvla Bay, the 53rd Division I believe.  Considerable progress has been made.
Monday 9thHeavy gun fire continues at Anzac & to a less extent at Achi Baba
