Tuesday 22 August 1916A warm summer's day. Left Warloy Baillon about 9 o'clock & came through Vadencourt, Herissait, & Val de Maison to La Vicogne, arriving about 1.30 after a dusty march.Crops along the route were quite ripe for the most part, & in many places harvesting was in full swing, binders & scythes being operated by very young or very old folk. One wished that a few battalions of our men might be put on to the ground to get the crops all in before it is too late. Lunch was ready for us, & during the afternoon took things easy, going to C Co. of the 2nd Bn. for dinner. Slept out under the trellised archway behind the house.
