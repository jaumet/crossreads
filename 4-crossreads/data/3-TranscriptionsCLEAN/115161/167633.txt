My dirty rifle was of far greater value to me than was the exceptionally clean one to my friend.
The time and labour my friend expended on his "best friend" was more than once the cause of strong words between us, and many a time I was compelled to go out alone leaving him to his favourite hobby, to return an hour later to find him still on the same job.
Night again approaches, and as dusk appears we "stand to"
There has been little activity noticeable in front of us.  We hope to be relieved later.
Towards midnight another battalion arrives and takes over the trenches.  It is some time however before we are able to march out, different positions have to be pointed out, certain orders have to be explained.
The roll is then called, very small compared with the last roll call of two nights ago.  We form up in single file passing down the trench, silently, out in front of the village already mentioned, from which the machine guns are still ping, pinging at us in the darkness, passing over the slippery, muddy and shell-holed ground, into the sunken road where yesterday morning I had collected Horatio, and where we now trip over the bodies of some of the enemy.
It was raining heavily.  We clambered up the muddy sloping side of the road on to the higher land which was the scene of such slaughter.  We see dark mounds and realise what they are.  They are the unburied bodies of our fallen comrades.  We pick our way carefully through them, and the whole awfulness comes back to us.  We realise how lucky we have been, but they are away from it all now.  Are we lucky after all.  Are they not better off than we?
