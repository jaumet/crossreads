1stly on our front on the left the 9th Battn. with the 9th Division went over captured Meteren 350 prisoners at 7.50 this morning. On the right a ?labour? battn. relieved the 29th Division were caught changing over. About 50 casualties for the night. The German advance is held. Rumour is current that the French have made a counter offensive on a twenty five kilo front right flank on German right flank Chateau Thierry have captured 17000 prisoners, 200 guns advanced to a depth of 10-12 kilos. Seems very reliable. "Vive la France".
