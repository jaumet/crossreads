<p>Lots have claimed the honour included J.M. Antil but he was on board when I came along as I spoke to him.  It was a great feat &amp; I'll tell you all about it when I see you.  Kind regards to Rami &amp; tell him I am expecting my other star.  I wrote him also about it.  I expect you won't know anyone tho now that you are G.S.O. [General Staff Officer].  Good luck to you.  I hope you will have a crown or something better by the time I get back.  Poor Ernie Brown had bad luck hadn't he.  They tell me he went a bit ratty at the finish the strain was too much.  We are all off so report says in a few weeks to Continent.  I don't know how we will hold the men there.  What has become of Kirkland &amp; Mr. Moore now old boy.  Kindest regards.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully<br/>J. Lamrock</p>
