beer or spirits I never touch nor never will, after we had finished all abou but 20 or 30 francs we decided to go down to a little shop & do the rest in eggs bread & butter & etc, but the funniest part of all was to come for when we had come back as far as the corner of the estaminet they all stopped for coming up the road was a couple of Aussies & a Jock & the latter was playing an accordion for all he was worth, when our crowd heard the music they all started dancing round about to the Scotties music of course they pulled the Jock up & then they started the Jock playing the tunes & our issue dancing the Highland fling, jigs & etc. laugh I nearly died for the whole crowd were stung & so just in the mood
