 Dear Sir   &  Brother, 
 Will you be good enough when handling the enclosed cheque to the representatives of our deceased soldier Brother, to convey the sincere sympathy of the Society, and point out that the Order, whilst mourning his death, fully realises that by his serving and dying for his country, he has placed those who may, by Providence, be permitted to remain in life possibly for a few years longer, under a deep debt of gratitude. Indeed, we confidently look forward to the time when we shall receive the "Benefits of the Dying" in the ultimate success of the War in which they so nobly served and fell. 
 Yours fraternally Signed:   J Taylor Grand Secretary 
 E.J. Timms Esq The Secretary Loyal Junction Lodge Gordon Ave Junction. Merewether.
