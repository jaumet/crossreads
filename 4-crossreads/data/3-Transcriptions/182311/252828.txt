<p>French Raid at Houplines (Armentieres) in vicinity of the Pont Ballot Salient by one (Composite) Battalion from the 10th Bde A.I.F, on night of 26/2/17. O.C. Raid Lt./Col C. Daviss D.S.O.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;One Crowded Hour.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I&#39;ll drop the general description and turn to&nbsp; my own part in the show.&nbsp; z-z-z-z-z-pap! and a trench mortar has sent a pineapple in amongst us, a message comes to me, &quot;one man killed, five so severely wounded as to be unfit to go over,&quot; then my hurried instruc-</p>
