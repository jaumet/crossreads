[Monday January 2 1916]
Went Alexandria to see about Brigade Baggage in Anzac-  A good train runs & a Hamper can be ordered en route so I travelled in de luxe  The delta is all green now with growing crops-  Found the wharfs covered with Kits, Guns, Rifles, etc etc, & after sorting thro' large quantities found a few Signal Troop Baskets of Lamp Helios etc:-  Much Baggage had been broken & looted en route all jumbled up together & lying in Pools of Water, as it has rained all day.I do not expect to find any of mine, I am getting too old a soldier to worry about Kit now, Cut the loss & buy some more & be thankful you have your own carcase.
