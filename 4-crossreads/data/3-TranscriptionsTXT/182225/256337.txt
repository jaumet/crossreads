AUGUST   SUNDAY 6   1916
Fine but looked like a change in evening. Mother & I went to service at the Cathedral & I was very disappointed with the Service. It was totally different to any I ever heard before, long & not to the point at all. Got a car ^in after dinner and went out to Tidsworth & saw Struan. He has grown a fine Big fellow. We had tea in Tidsworth together & then we took him back to camp & I came on here with mother & she went back to Salisbury after. I heard Pitt Brown was married on Thursday last & Alan was best man.
