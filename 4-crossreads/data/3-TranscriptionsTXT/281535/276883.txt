 17/3/19 Marcinelle Took a walk round the cooks this morning and visited the Echo office and other odd places until lunch time. Dr Daniel then went over me for life assurance &ndash; a rather long operation after which we went up the town together and had some afternoon tea. Read and wrote until mess and then afterwards went to Dr Mathys to spend the evening. They seem truly a happy couple and we drank wine and coffee and ate biscuits &amp; a tart. Here in conversation we discuss all sorts of topics that otherwise would be absolutely forbidden. They are fine openhearted folk full of hospitality and cannot be too kind. Gorman and myself have asked them to come with us to the Opera next Sunday evening.
