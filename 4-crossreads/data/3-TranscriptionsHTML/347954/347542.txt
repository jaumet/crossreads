<p>I have visited a good number of the outlaying suburbs &amp; find it very hard to outclass Zeatoun.  It has a charm of its own &amp; viewing the surrounding districts from my friend's balcony was certainly a treat.  Right across was the palatial &amp; modern suburb of Helioplis (City of the sun) &amp; on the right the plantation &amp; residence of the Khedive &amp; the left side showed Maadi &amp; its adjacent environments.  Most of the places mentioned are indeed beautiful &amp; at present the white tents of the soldiers contrasting with the different hues make it rather picturesque.</p>
