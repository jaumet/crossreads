<p>22/4/19<br/>Strassburg<br/>Up and out by 9.30 and went up to the Place Kleber. Walked round all the streets with their well stocked shops and came to the conclusion that this city (excepting a small portion of Collins St.) is much better than Melbourne. To the Cathedral stopping for a minute to admire its fa&ccedil;ade &amp; then going inside to watch a service. Then to the great clock and saw it strike the hour. Who should I run into here but Pat Gorman and Y. Miles!. They were as surprised as myself. We went and had a beer and some cake and then did the Broglie Platz and the Kaiser's Square where the Palace is. Returned to my hotel and got ready to leave by the 12.20 train for Mayence. Today is sunny and fine but a cold wind blows off</p>
