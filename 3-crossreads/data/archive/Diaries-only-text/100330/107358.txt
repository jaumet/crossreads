number of Soldiers on board after a good Run of a few minutes we stopped at a station called Abbede where a lot more soldiers got aboard, after a few minutes delay, we were off again until Caistre was arrived at where more boys joined up then off again made one more stop at a Big R.O.D Depot called Borre for a few minutes when more boys joined then into Hazelbruick arriving there at 8 am. After reporting ourselves at the R.T.O. Office they told us the leave Train would be in any minute, so we waited for a while when we decided to adjourn to the Y.M.C.A. for a Cup of Tea. Hazelbruick is a fine Station but no conveniences from one Platform to another, Passengers have to cross over the lines. As a Goods Train was blocking the Main Platform, the People had to walk down the line over Rails stones to cross behind the van, there is no mistake the people are behind the times. After drinking our Tea we waited about for our Train
