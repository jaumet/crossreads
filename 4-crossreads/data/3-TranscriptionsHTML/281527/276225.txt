<p>21/3/18  Red Lodge</p>
<p>On our right last night the 5th Bde tried to get at the Boche in a raid but did no good. On our left two officers and an N.C.O. on a special reconnaisance were run right into by a party of 60(?) Boche and utterly routed them by point blank shooting with two revolvers and one rifle! At least, that is the story! A very quiet evening and we dined happily in our mess where "A" Coy &ndash; Rodda Fulton &amp; Co visit us. The team just now is Major Dooley, Capt Stewart, Lts K Sutherland, Groves, Thewlis, McCartin, Smith JA, Bourke, Capt Miles, D McMahon, Padre Smith. "A" Coy. Capt, Rodda, Lanyan, Lts. Fulton, Anderson Bruce (all 13 LH) Abercrombie. "B" Coy Capt. Mackinnon, Lt Westaway, Armstrong</p>
