<p>Some A.M.C chap got a hold of me and dressed my wound. The next shell landed right into one of our waggons which was loaded with bombs. I heard later that the wheel was left. As soon as my arm was dressed I got. Being windy was not in it. Blue Funk was more like it.</p>
<p>About 15 minutes later my brother found me and dragged me to the Dressing Station, where the Doctor had a look at my arm then after redressing it, was told to go over and have something to eat and have a smoke, as I had to wait for an ambulance to take me to the C.C.S. (Casualty Clearing Station) while waiting there some more of our boys came in., and from them I was told eight or nine were wounded and one killed with the same shell. I was very lucky as I was nearest to the shell yet I think had the smallest wound.</p>
