To carry out this work it will be necessary for me to be sent to some camp or unit in England where I can have told off for my work a batman &amp; a groom both Australian L.H. with horses available day by day for models &amp; reference with full marching orders outfit.  If possible a hut should be provided where the big picture about 10' feet by 4&frac12;' or 5' could be painted.  Army pay should be immediately continued or half the commission price for the picture paid in advance.  In the former case all sketches could become the property of Aust. War Memorial &amp; in the latter they would naturally remain property of the artist.  It may be asked by the Commissioner [?] why after five 4 months work in Palestine further studies are required for a big picture.  The reason for this is that the artist wisely concentrated on recording the battle grounds on the spot making such studies of men &amp; horses etc. as time would allow leaving to such avoiding the use of valuable time in pursuit of technical details until which could be as well done in England as in Palestine.
