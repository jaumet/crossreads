<p>boat was hit yesterday, and slightly damaged. She had to be towed to dock<br/>15/9/1915<br/>A thunderstorm this morning rained like fury. Started to rain at 12 oclock. The French got in with a bit of a bombardment. Our Adjutant returned from Anzac yesterday. I suppose we will have to shift soon, as the 176th regiment of French infantry are making dugouts in our lines. They ask no questions, but simply mark out the place, and bring about 200 men and start to work. The rain has stopped 6.A.M. It turned out a fine day. We are having a new routine as regards parades, Orders are now that we must have an hours foot drill and half an hour signalling each morning. The Turks bombarded us something terrific this morning for about an hour. The old game was played again, 3 and 4 shells over at a time. I am almost certain that the French will take over this peninsula, they have landed some heavy guns 9.2 long range. The preparations they are making are extensive. Three New Zealanders, killed in action about three months ago, their bodys were only got and buried yesterday. A prayer book found on one had a note in it, saying, if anything</p>
