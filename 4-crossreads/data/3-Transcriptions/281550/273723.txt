<p><u>December</u></p>
<p>think that they had better feed us for the last few days that we are to be in their country.</p>
<p>On the 4th of December I left Luneburg for Soltau Lager together with all the Prisoners that were working at both the Saline Factories.</p>
<p>The men from almost all the working Commando's have been recalled to Soltau Lager.</p>
<p>I arrived at Soltau at about 10pm and got an issue of Parcels straight away. In Soltau there is almost 1,000 Englishmen, and it is the biggest bunch of Britishers that I have seen in Germany. We all expect to be leaving for England very soon, We may get word to pack up and move any day now. I received a photo of Etta to-day.</p>
<p>For the past week we have had a lot of rumours about leaving for England but up to the present none of them have come true.</p>
