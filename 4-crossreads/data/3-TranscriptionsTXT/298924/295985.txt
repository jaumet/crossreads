 Friday, 3 January 1919 President of 3 Field General Court Martials today.  Went into figures of 1st L.H. Regt. &amp; find the following &ndash; 
 Casualties, not sickness Officers &ndash; Other ranks 46 &ndash; 636 
 not counting twice, wounded.  These figures are larger than any other Australian Unit yet many people think the L.H. have done little or no fighting.

 General Allenby's words were printed in big white letters &ndash; 
 "I was proud of you once.  I am proud of you no longer." This was the end of this speech after the Bedouin affair.
