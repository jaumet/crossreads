<p>4th June 1916  An Artillery duel on our right caused a stand to at night.  Some shells over in the day.</p>
<p>5th June 1916  Shelling very close.  7th Brigade intended doing a stunt to-night and had to stand to from 9 p.m. till 3.30 a.m., stunt never came off.</p>
<p>6th June 1916  Standing to all night again.  At 11.30 our Artillery opened out on to Fritz's parapets.  Fritz paid it back with interest and things got lively.  Not many casualties.  7th made a very successful raid.</p>

<p>11th June 1916  To-night at about 11 p.m. Allemand? started to throw bombs which we paid back with compound interest.  Artillery opened up and things got very mixed for a while.</p>

<p>19th June 1916  Very cold day.  Plenty of shelling.  Up again twice during the night.  Fritz seems to have developed a habit of annoying us.</p>
<p>20th June 1916  Quiet day.  Some 14th Battalion men came to look over to-day, so our dreams of a spell seem to be materialising.  The Company had bad luck to-day.  A shell hit the billet (intended for a Battery behind) and killed four men and wounded eleven.  No. 2 Section and reinforcements.</p>
<p>22nd June 1916  To-night a bombardment on both sides.  Shells very close to us but no damage, also gas alarm.</p>
