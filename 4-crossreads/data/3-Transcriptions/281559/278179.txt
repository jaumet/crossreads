<p>Thursday June 5th Capetown</p>
<p>Up anchor &amp; away at 8.15 am struck a choppy sea &amp; the old tub rolled badly : I felt pretty crook all day :</p>
<p>Friday June 6th at Sea</p>
<p>Nothing much doing : still a fair sea running &amp; we are getting a good roll about</p>
<p>Saturday June 7th at Sea</p>
<p>Nothing much doing : sea a bit quieter : haven't been too good since leaving Capetown : it must be the surplus feeds we had there :</p>
<p>Sunday June 8th at Sea</p>
<p>Church parade in morn : sing song at night</p>
