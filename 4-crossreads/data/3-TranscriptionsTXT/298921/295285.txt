November, 1915Monday 22A Dentist works at the Field Ambulance, not far away & even a set of False Teeth can be made -Some of the men have been collecting the plates out of the skulls on the Beach as Souvenirs - Ghouls -Again all ranks have been warned about communicating any War News in their letters. I try to avoid the subject but beyond what we eat how we live & the quantity of vermin there is really little else. I have just made a Cook house out of Stones from the Beach, covered with Clay & roofed with part of a Sail from the wreckage this is for the men in the Mess.
