<p>Still further news of the Russian offensive, the Germans have come up but are not strong enough to push the Russians back, they still continue to advance &amp; collect huge quantities of booty.</p>
<p>Aero reconnaissence today shows little movement in the enemy although out Salmana way back of large convoys are noticeable our boys should be returning from the Stunt now &amp; glad to get home. Heaps of shipping on the canal &amp; I myself spent the greater part of my time dividing its waters &amp; was in up to 10.30 pm, full moon &amp; what nights wasted, little activity in the office no luck with Alec so far, hope to succeed when in Cairo. Bed at 11 tired out.</p>
