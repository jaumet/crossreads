 All this close attention to detail and discipline has its result in the very high performance of the Squadron itself as regards flying operations. 
 On this Squadron has always fallen a large portion of the work which has had to be performed by the Royal Air Force in Palestine, since the day that the Egyptian Expeditionary Force left the canal. The results that have been achieved by the Royal Air Force have been to a very marked degree due to the fine work of the No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps. 
 I wish to place on record my high opinion of the efficiency of this Squadron, and associate myself fully with the remarks of General Borton that it is a matter of pride to me to have had this Squadron under my command since the days of its formation.
