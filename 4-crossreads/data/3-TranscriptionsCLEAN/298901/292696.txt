  
 Sgts had, rather a nice place & we made a comfortable mess out of it, in addition to getting good beds.  Richtofen, one of Germanys leading airmen was brought down during the day by one of our machine gunners, the news spread very rapidly & was in everyones mouth.  We held sports during the afternoon but I was too busy to see much of them, there was good competition, B section winning with A second.  During the afternoon one of the shells landed right amongst the spectators but did not burst.  It was a miraculous escape as it is strange that noone was hit even by the shell itself apart from the burst.  The sports went on without check.  Altho feeling dogged tired at night felt much better in spirit. 
 Monday 22nd April Very busy again.  Started by fixing up a Cafe opposite in which to do sick parades so as to relieve the dressing room of a lot of work & leaving space for wounded.  The French soldier was buried during the morning we lending a Ford Car & providing a Guard.  First the body was put into a coffin
