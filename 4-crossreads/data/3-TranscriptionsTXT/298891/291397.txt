10 Saturday
Day off.  Sister Davis & I caught a French touring car at the Cross Roads & went to Berinbza arriving at 11.45.  We spent the time looking at houses & came back with the nice young French officer who dropped us at the hospital at 4.30.  Some sunshine but some grey also.Came on to rain at night.
