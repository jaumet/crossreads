  
 9th January El Arish Tuesday No Taubes paid us visits during the moonlight so we [who are left] had a peaceful night of it. The whole Anzac Mounted Division has gone to take Rafa no news has come back yet our machines have been flying backwards and forwards all the morning. Been feeling sick again today, don't know what is wrong went to our 1st L.H. Field Ambulance but all doctors have gone out. At 11.30 a Taube came over from the South side of El Arish and the first intimation we had of it was the loud crash of 5 bombs one after the other presently the machine came into our field of vision. The anti-aircraft guns banged shell after shell into the air but none hit the Taube allthough some of them were close He even had the audacity to come back and fly amongst the bursting shells He sailed away however and went north along the coast. 3. pm No details as to how the scrap has gone yet. Thought I heard guns or bombs once or twice but the distance is great for such sounds - 30 miles
