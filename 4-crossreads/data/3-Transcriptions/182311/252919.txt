<p>My Dear People,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A dull day, the wind blowing freshly, but thank goodness, no rain!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning had been spent on indoor work, a kit check, and I had had no exercise, neither had the horse, so at three o&#39;clock I had Annie (the mare) sent up to the Mess and mounting, made for the high plains for our village and in fact every village hereabouts is nestled in a valley, out of the biting wind.&nbsp; This wind was stirring on the high ground, and after a canter cross-country and a trot for three kilos I was glad when the road turned down into a valley with its invariable dirty little village.&nbsp; Here I saw the quaintest and poorest church that I have ever seen, wattle and daub for hte most part, and relieved by tiles which however in some places, had dropped off.&nbsp; The weathercock surmounting the gable hung awry and the metal crucifix in front of the Church was at a drunken angle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Today was not suitable to photography so I had not taken a camera, but I mean<s>t</s> to take a run over on the first fine day and secure a photograph to send you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The magnificence or otherwise of a church building and the many roadside cricifixes is a sure index to the wealth or poverty of a village, and here I found &quot;Like xxx Church Like Village&quot; for the homes were all poor.</p>
