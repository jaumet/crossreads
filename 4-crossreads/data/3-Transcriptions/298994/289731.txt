<p>It was not quite <strike>dusk</strike> dawn when we landed here. We did look nice clean boys! My overcoat weighed about 200 lbs</p>
<p>We stayed here and breakfasted and moved off again about 3 in the afternoon A five mile march brought us to Corbie, a French town of a good size, wholly deserted and much damaged by shell fire.</p>
<p>(April 9th 1918) I am sitting in an upstairs window, thinking of the Better 'Ole sketches Oh how true to life they are!</p>
<p>Today 10/4/18 we moved off to Foilliz, 2 miles distant. Here we billeted in quite a substantial French house. We set up housekeeping here! We had little to do here, we used to man a machine gun near the cross roads <strike>4 hrs</strike> in four hour shifts each day Foilliz was similar to Corbie in terrible ruin, Fritz used to land his souvenirs about our billet at times</p>
<p>We spent a fine time in this billet, thanks to the fish, we bombed out of the river</p>
