Spent a fairly busy morning on routine odds and ends and at lunch had some things of interest to discuss with a Y.M.C.A lecturer. Smythe came in for a talk after lunch and then I went round to DHQ and had a long talk with General Robertson fixing up a number of things. While there Major General Tivey came in as Robertson goes to England. We all had afternoon tea together and talked a good deal about military life in Australia. After evening mess took a walk up the town and had a good look round. Snow on the ground and in the air sent me to bed ravenously hungry.
