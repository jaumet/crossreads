<p>The fight was between 4 British and 4 German planes, it lasted for half an hour before any of them showed any sign's of wanting to get away, and all of a sudden, that is after a lot of good manouvering one German machine fell and a cheer went up from the boys, not long after the second German plane went tumbling to the ground so the other two fled for their lives.  It was a splendid fight.</p>
<p>While in these billits we had a good few shells land around us, but as long as they never hit, it was all right.</p>
<p>While one of our companies was in billits near the mouth of a communication trench, they had the misfortune to have their billit shelled and burned to the ground, as luck favoured them</p>
