<p>Saturday, 25 September, 1915<br/>It was only a demonstration by our chaps last night &amp; the Turks did the rest, they generally fire for about two hrs after about 10 min, demonstration.  Everything points to a big attack being carried off to-night on one day this week it will be a big one as great arrangements are being made.</p>
<p>I made a new bivy [bivouac] to-day and I can crawl into this and have a quiet read, but if I sit in the dressing stn for a few minutes every passer by will suddenly discover that he has a scratch that wants bandaging or some trivial complaint.</p>
<p>Sunday, 26 September, 1915<br/>The big attack did not come off after all and we were not called during the night.  Bulgaria has mobilized as an armed neutrality and their have been all kinds of wild rumours that she has joined with Germany against the allies, I think this improbable although who ever does get her will have a powerful ally.  Issued with new clothing to-day socks, shirts, tunics, hats etc all of a warm kind they a very acceptable as were rather cold in knickers.  I rec a big stray mail today 9 letters in which was better news than the last.  Church Parade in the pm.</p>
