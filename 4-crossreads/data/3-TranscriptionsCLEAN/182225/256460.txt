 1916   THURSDAY 7   DEC. 
 Fine all day, but came on misty rain about sundown. Exercising horses in the morning & cleaning harness ect. up at the harness room all afternoon. The 27 th  battery was shooting out of the gun pits in the morning & did some very good shooting I believe. I went down & saw Hughie McMaster, Reg Wall ect in evening after going to the Palace with Warren. Its good to see old mates again & compare notes ect. 
 The anniversary of Linda's & my engagement.
