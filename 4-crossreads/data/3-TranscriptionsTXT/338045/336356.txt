 Nov 20th &ndash; Monday 
 Usual reaction &amp; feel properly done up &amp; stick to bed till late, keep quiet all the morning. Visit of the Duke &amp; Duchess of Connaught &amp; Princess Patricia, which we all agree is a blessed nuisance. Don't visit our ward; so we have a look at them. Still raining &amp; miserably cold. 
 Nov 21st &ndash; Tuesday 
 Rain cleared off, but still cold. Heavy "London fog" descends &amp; even here it is thick. Lights &amp; heat off at 7 pm as a result we are in bed early. Freezing cold all night.
