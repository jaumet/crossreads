<p>[Transcriber's note:  This is the sixth diary of Frank Molony of the 1st Field Ambulance.  The diary commences when he is in La Clytte and concludes at Allonville.  In May he moves to Headquarters at St. Silvestre Cappel to assist with the detailing and printing of maps for the Brigades.  As always he is most interested in literature, orders many books from book companies in England and France and quite often quotes from poetry books he has acquired.  He constantly describes the countryside, the weather and the villages he visits when possible.]</p>
