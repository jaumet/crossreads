I'm no cut glass raffle prizeI'm no fragile little roseGrab me with a python gripIf I struggle, call the bluffWant my love, then take the tipTreat me rough kidTreat me rough
I don't want my cheek caressedWith a nice respectful peckYank me wildly to your chestIf I fight you, break my neckPlease dont be a gentle dubSpelling la-de-dah-ish guffWoo and win me with a clubTreat me rough kidTreat me rough
