<p>Travel and experiences are all very well, and in civil life or in peacetime it would be delightful, but in war time, though it is more exciting, there are many hardships, restrictions, and a lack of home comforts, not the least being the lack of the society of my dear wife and friends.  But these I will regain when I return home and put on my civic clothes again.<br/>To day the weather is very dull and cloudy.  This hospital is fairly comfortable.  There are plenty of blankets, and an abundance of food.  The patients are mostly wounded soldiers from the big raid of Monday night.  They are only slightly wounded in this ward which is numbered B and contains 17 beds.  This morning I had my right foot dressed and hot fomentations</p>
