  
 29.6.15 Tue. 29th.  Bourke of A Sqd. was killed last night in the trenches here.  We gave the enemy a display of fireworks at 9 oclock, with Indian Star Shells, it was a fine sight, the shell is fired from a gun & when they explode send out 5 large stars (either blue or red) which lights up the country wonderfully.  The enemy counter attacked during the night at J13 & were repulsed.  A party of Turks established themselves between J11 & J12 & were this morning enfiladed by machine gun fire & either killed or captured.  Respirators & water to damp them have been placed in the trenches to-day, we have been anticipating an attack of gas for some time, but it is seldom the wind blows in the right direction for them & we have not had a whiff of gas so far.  Artillery has been fairly constant from the Turks & large shell still fall on Walkers Ridge every evening.  One of the shells hit a man to-day & he has not been seen since.
