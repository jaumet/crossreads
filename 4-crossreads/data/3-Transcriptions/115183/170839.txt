The next day <br/>22July 1917 (Sunday)  After tea I set out with N.Rosenthal and we walked through Bailleul to the Belgian village of St.Jans Cappel. This village lies in a hollow under Mont Novi and is rather quaint. Walking on these late summer evening was very pleasant as well as informative. St Jans Cappell  (Fr: St.Jens Chapelle) has a rather fine spired church also a large RomanCatholic institution of some sort. At Bailleul on our way home I bought a lace handkerchief to send home. It is rather interesting to watch the lace being made by the old dames who earn up to about 3 frs. A day so I was told. This h'chief was 7 francs .The value for exchange and army pay of a franc is 8 4/5</p>
