16/9/15 Abdul very quiet during evening but at 10.15 by concerted action for miles along front we drew his fire. At 10.15 flares and rockets followed by rapid fire, fixed bayonets , noise etc. His flares up at once and rifle and machine gun fire poured in on us. Went up into firing line quarter of an hour before so as to be on the scene in good time. Punctual to time the ball opened. The rockets a beautiful sight illuminating the scene and making it as bright as day. Enormous things with sticks 6-7 feet long. Inferno of noise on both sides, bombs etc. The machine gun rifles pouring a hail of flame over our head and cracking into the sandbags. A few casualties but not serious. Achieved desired result and established at least one fact that there are very few of them immediately opposite us, but the trenches are probably mined and enfiladed and no good result would be served by our occupying them. Bed 10.20 and slept very well.
17/9/15 Up Bitterly cold. The winter campaign here is going to be deadly severe on us. Cold in head. Climate in Egypt suited me ? always in top form there. Round trenches and yarning nearly all the morning and examined the position alround per periscope , trenches near Lone Pine seemed deserted ? most striking feature was the utter absence of anyone to the view. Chessboard most prominent feature one mass of criss cross trenches just like its name. Abdul opened with 3 new guns and put shells closer to us than ever previously. We got several fragments. Mess dugout completed. Doctor Drummond Stewart MacLennan Sup C.O.
