 Thu. 31st May. (cont.) The "Wairuna" was pushing along through the islands of the Hauraki Gulf when I came out on deck.   Glorious weather.  Being the first steamer of the "tramp" order I have yet been on, the old tub has been of some interest today.  She has iron decks, (except for a wood-covered walking space on the port side);&ndash; the officer's cabins open off a small saloon under the bridge:&ndash;  the engineers have a special row of cabins on the lower deck. 
 Meals are served:&ndash; Breakfast 8.  Dinner. noon.  Tea. 5.30 p. (Unholy hours)  The food is quite good, but the table can scarcely be called a Festive Board.  The Old Man is a rather quiet Englishman, the Chf Engr. is a Melbourne Scotsman who endeavours to always say and do the "correct thing" (he never opens his mouth unless to eat or to bring out platitudes)
