<p>the historical precedents which have established these ideas as oft repeated truths. The want of due regard for these principles as guides is the great danger that is present with every set of men who have not had a sound training in early life, upon which can be built the higher stories in the progress of education. It matters not how the strong man may be abused in times of peace and quietness, every one has to depend upon him in times of strife and war. Few have the power to lead and dictate, most of us have been constructed after the fashion which requires leading and directing. Think you not so?<br/>Many thanks my dear for the cuttings from the newspapers. The letter by our little Dickey Bird smells of the midnight oil when he was dreaming of us far from home.
