 This afternoon has been exceptionally quiet and there is no bombardment to night. 
 [Shorthand transcribed as follows] I wrote to Tom Douglas, Miss Annie McKinly and my sister Mrs. Sally Kittson tonight. [End of shorthand] Sunday Nov. 18. 1917.  1203. 
 Dull &amp; foggy. 
 There was a church parade this morning for those who could get away. Protestants 9.30, R.C. 10 A.M. 
 There was also an inspection of the harness &amp; horses by the A.S.C. and our vet Cpt. Davidson. One of our horses has the mange and the back stable were disinfected in consequence. 
 For months past we have had a plague of lice in our clothes. The bites itch very much &amp; we have to frequently change our clothes &amp; wash them, or they would crawl away. Now a kind of rash is breaking out on a lot of the men which is similar to scurvy. It is very itchy at night. The probable cause of it is a lack of sufficient vegetables, and clean clothes. 
 There is not much bombardment today, &amp; none this morning. What there is is up towards Ypres and Passchendaele.

 I am on picquet to night
