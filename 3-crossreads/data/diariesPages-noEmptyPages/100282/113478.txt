who could attend were there the Hall was well filled, it was most interesting I followed it closely, but what struck me most of all was the wonderful opinion he had of the French the brainy way they go about their attacks, in all of which I thoroughly agree with him for the French are a wonderful good race of people.
6th. Had a full marching order parade this morning, after falling in we marched out on to our parade ground took our packs off done a little drill platoon drill rifle exercises till 11 oclock then we marched down to the Battn parade ground for an inspection by the Colonel, here he presented A.Coy. with the silver bugle which they won at the last inter Company sports, C.Coy won it first but A Coy. beat us at the last sports, it is a fine bugle it is for competition among the Coys of the Battalion, it is a good thing for it creates a feeling of rivalry.
