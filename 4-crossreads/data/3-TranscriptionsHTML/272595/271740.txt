<p>Sunday when one ought to be well out of the Camp.<br/>These sandbaggers are getting to work round here again, the other night they killed an officer in one of the little quiet roads leading from Warminster to the Camp &amp; there have been several more case's of cracked heads, I reckon they should make an example of the first one they catch shoot him publicly &amp; before the whole of the Camps make a big event out of it, the rest of them would not be so keen on it then I'll bet.<br/>Got a parcel yesterday from the Wagga Comfort Fund Miss Duke is responsible for this, shes not a bad sort.<br/>9th  Been raining fairly heavy on &amp; off the whole day, I was to have had a nerve out but my dentist "Charlie Chaplin" as the boys call him had an abscess in his mouth</p>
