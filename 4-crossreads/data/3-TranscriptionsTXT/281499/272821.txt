They have got a nice church here & I was in it for a while, it is amusing to watch the French people coming into church, they first all walk up to the "Holy water" & then cross themselves & when they get opposite the altar, they bend their knee right down, the place was full of little girls & most of them were praying & a few were saying "confession" in their little boxes.Any amount of women barbers at work here, it seems funny to watch them  Saw Captain Jackson & Lieut. Beckett this evening they have just come back from EnglandOn the way down we saw a pretty sight 2 aeroplanes starting off for their flight, they work up a great pace before they leave the ground
