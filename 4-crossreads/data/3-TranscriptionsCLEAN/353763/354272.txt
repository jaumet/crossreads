  
 E3 has been missing over a week in the North Sea  -  E signifies a class only the highest & best class of British Submarines up to date - There's a D - class & C class - F class will be higher than E but as yet its not in existence - therefore of the 3 E boats - 1 & 3 are gone & only the Australian E2 is afloat  -  Wonder what the Commander thinks? It was nice coming up the harbor in her  -  She conveys a sense of power to you as she rapidly moves with  8  her 1600 horse power Diesel engines - (2 at 800 each)  -  Everyone comes to the shipside to see AE2 as she passes  -  Personally I think the Destroyers give me as big a sense of power & a lot more feeling of Security  - 
 Tuesday Oct 27 - I am posting this aftn  -  Nothing fresh - Cumberledge was on board this morning & I gave him C's message which he reciprocates saying he remembered him well  -  We'r going to have a 'Shivoo' on the Destroyers on Thursday 29  -  I'll tell you all about it later  - The weather is glorious & Suva at its best - opposite us a boat is loading Fiji bananas  -
