  
 Div. Headquarters 11 July. 1916 
 Dear Judge Ferguson, 
 I started to write to you the other day when your cable came, in order to explain how it was that I had won   [indecipherable] details. Since then we have been constantly on the move and this is the first opportunity I have had of continuing my letter. I should most certainly have cabled before but the authorities are most definite in their instruction about any casualties or circumstances attending them being mentioned in cables. As this was the case I had to content myself with a letter which gave fairly full details. Since then there are one or two small pieces of information which you would perhaps like to know. The funeral was held on the morning of the 15th. Several of the 20the Officers including Harper & myself were present also a guard of honour from his old company.
