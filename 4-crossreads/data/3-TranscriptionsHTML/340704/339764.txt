<p>April 1917<br/>Thursday 19<br/>The big fight<br/>The biggest battle the 10th ever in lasted all day. 13000 Turks against us. Our casualties very heavy. 98 in our regt.</p>
<p>I had three narrow escapes and was lifted about a foot from the ground by a high explosive shell. Watch saved me from a stomach wound. Got in Wadi Ghuzze and worked back. Here Disher killed Major Hamlin wounded. Saw some Tommies with awful wounds.</p>
<p>Friday 20<br/>Digging trenches and occupied them I was out on listening post all night cold as charity.<br/>Tanks were a huge failure.</p>
