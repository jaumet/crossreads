<p>My dear Mrs Edwards<br/>Gordon left here on Thursday to Perham Downs. I daresay he told you he was staying with us. I promised him I would write to you this mail , as I know how lovely it is to hear from someone who has seen your boy and to know how he really is looking , our boy Jack is just 20 &amp; at present is in a destroyer so I don't very often see him,  so can well understand how you must long to see your dear boy sometimes &amp; to know in yourself  just how he is looking.</p>
<p>Gordon came to me straight from hospital and he looks simply splendidly</p>
