  
 1918 Thu. 4th Apl. (cont.) 
 Karlsruhe was in darkness;  all necessary lights were shaded, & all arriving train passengers were subjected to strict examination I was passed through the military examining gates. 
 Big notices are on view all over the station "To the cellars", [indecipherable]   Fliegergefahr" (air-raid danger.)   My Unteroffizier took me through the darkened streets to the ex-hotel "Europaischer Hof", now a receiving depot for officer-prisoners. 
 In the lobby he obtained a receipt for "ein Gefangener, Englische."   The old blighter took quite an affectionate leave - (for one awful instant I though he was going to kiss me!) and wished me a "gluckliche Gefangenschaft" (a happy imprisonment) & the old thing was not sarcastic, either!
