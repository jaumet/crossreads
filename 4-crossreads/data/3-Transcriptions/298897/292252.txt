<p>already in.</p>
<p>Monday 6th March</p>
<p>In camp once more &amp; as things are very easy, nothing much to do, everyone is very comfortable.</p>
<p>Wednesday 8th March<br/>Had leave and went to Cairo.  Spent  &pound;3. on things to send home &amp; also sent away some photos etc.  Then I ran out to Zeilorin to see Will D. Managed to pick up some mail from him &amp; met some fellows I had left in Sydney.  Also met a man off the "Ceramic".  Altogether a good day.  On duty for remainder of week in dispensary, it being practically assured that I get the appointment.</p>
<p>Saturday 11th March.<br/>Had rather a bombshell arrive in camp today.  It appears that a staff sergeant who has been 7 months in England has just been sent back &amp; his unit the 4th Field Amb. refused to receive him whereupon the A.D.M.S. sent him to fill the position I had applied for, rather a bump &amp; the fellows are indignant that such a man &amp; an outsider should get one of our good positions.  Personally I am disappointed but having received more than one</p>
