<p>drunk had been put in my corner. Not liking to pass him out I turned in alongside but later he was troublesome so I had to move. The last I saw of him was about 2 A.M. when he sat on my face just when I was well asleep. The trip itself was very calm but I managed to get very little sleep.</p>
<p>Thursday 18th Jan.<br/>Left the boat about 7 A.M. &amp; marched to the rest camp again being told off to our stables again &amp; given 3 tickets for 3 meals. The meals turned out to be a lump of bread &amp; butter with sardines &amp; one had to stand in a queue for hours to get even that. I was feeling rather doleful but sent off a couple of letters &amp; then tried to fill in time walking round the camp &amp; generally found myself humming sad tunes. A rotten day altogether, cold &amp; rainy. At 7 P.M. they gave us 3 blankets each &amp; I was glad to turn in for the night after a meal of bread &amp; butter</p>
