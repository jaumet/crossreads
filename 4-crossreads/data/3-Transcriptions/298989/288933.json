<p>4/1/16<br/>Awakened by some several reveilles and noticed that of the 21st. &amp; 13 LH who had received their orders. Slept on till 0730 &amp; was then called to Bde HQ receiving orders to march on to camp at 1130. Set to work and left camp as clean as a bone at 1030 and spent rest of the time in readiness to move.</p>
<p>Set off for Sardi pier but no guide was provided and in consequence we took a muddy road at times almost impassable which, with heavy packs, made the march a slow one. Some of the men still stick to their Xmas billies and attach iron rations, Turks water bottles, thigh boots and other treasured things they have picked up, to every strap and buckle. We passed one Tommy wearing his overcoat. Just out of trenches, he was carrying a Turkish rifle the usual heavy pack and a huge bundle of "personal property" dangling by a couple of straps from his rear. This aspect tickled our chaps very much.</p>
<p>My batman Mitchell very unwell with inflammation of the spermatic cord. Davies &amp; Watkins with a pole went a head carrying our kits and we picked them all up on the ship. Sardi is a small place and the people undesirable. The soldiers soon teach the shysters their lingo and one hears some choice oaths from fruit vendors &amp;c. Passed detachments of the RN Division coming into camp said to be new men. The evacuation of Helles is said to be proceeding and tonight alleged to be the last night. They will be lucky if they get out as easily as we did.</p>
