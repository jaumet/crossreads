<p>July 1917<br/>1st   (Sunday)   We had a heavy shower of rain during the night, &amp; the place is very sloppy as a result, but although the weather has been dull all day, the rain kept off, &amp; we were able to make final preparations for the Regatta.<br/>All the pontoons &amp; superstructure of the three companies, was removed from our old position, further up stream to about half a mile above the Lock.   A suitable place for the sports has been decided upon &amp; we made a start to prepare the place.   A large lagoon adjoins the canal, &amp; the swimming &amp; diving part of the programme is to take place in there.</p>
