  
 her last dive was a beauty  -  She sank in a beautiful horizontal line & went right under  -  Wonderful, deadly craft  - 
 When leisure came I wrote you & also Turner & I thought I should get a chance to-day to send part of my serial tale but its washed out  -  This morning I dolled up & went on to the Flagship to see the PMO  -  Saw him & then went down to the Sick bay & saw all his contraptions  -  A very light bamboo stretcher 
 [drawing of a stretcher] with folding side flaps I liked muchly for use in ships, mines & elsewhere  -  He showed & examd  -  a Sailor at 29 with something wrong with his right eye  -  He seemed to me to have overused it in shooting  -  He was a very good rifle & revolver shot  -  If it is so it's the first case I've seen of that sort  -  It's the Peep sight said the Sailor  -  His vision field was limited & his pupil dilated to a medium size = o  -  Left pupil = o Color vision normal  - 
 Well I had a cocktail & pushed off with my special job done & that was to return a man to Sydney  -  We'r now up alongside the Aorangi - the store ship - for water  -  The Aorangi is up against the pier & this is our closest to lying alongside the thousand foot pier at Rabaul  - 
 We are leaving Rabaul to  - morrow for unknown parts - with the fleet - whole or in part  -  It's grand dry weather & we are - as a company - all well  -
