<p>2<br/>Have been up to the 19th Battn. but A &amp; B Coy has left &amp; no one seemed to know Grahame Garland. Went to church today &amp; was quite close to Capt. Jim Simpson. He looks much better since his trip to England. At Lemnos we had very good drinking water. Almost anywhere over there one gets good water by sucking &amp; the two Water Carts used to cart it for the Cooks &amp; we used to go &amp; fill our own water bottles.<br/>The Hospitals' supply came from a huge Condensing Plant which condensed the salt water. I don't think the water supply ever failed at all. I do hope the boys have had rain &amp; also all the other poor devils on the land.<br/>Was very glad to hear that Will was better &amp; trust he will not get another attack.</p>
