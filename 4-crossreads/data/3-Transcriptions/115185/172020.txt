<p>3 &ndash; won the military cross &ndash; been wounded and returned to the front &ndash;<br/>Since beginning this letter I heard at dinner that there is a memorial service at the Anzac Hostel at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. Two of our P.A. Sisters, who are on the reserve staff here and are not on duty yet, have been in making wreathes there, for the dead who are buried at Cairo Cemetery. So Major Coultman's grave will receive attention tomorrow &ndash; the wreathes are to be taken out after the ceremony. I wish I could go out but shall be on duty all day. I think I told you of the May tree I planted out at Cairo Military cemetery on Major Coultman's grave. I am hoping that Major Clive Thompson (Bathurst) will see about the cross. I have written him offering to help &ndash; if he cannot get up here. I forgot what I have told you and wonder often if I repeat myself. I don't want to go on transport duty unless you or Father are ill &ndash; or unless of course the war goes on into another year or I am tired and cant do my work &ndash; or am sent on transport by the Matron in chief.<br/>How lovely it would be to see you again you can't tell how I long to be home &ndash;</p>
