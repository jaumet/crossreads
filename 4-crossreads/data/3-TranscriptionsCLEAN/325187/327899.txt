[Monday 5 June 1916] [Following paragraphs are crossed out]I notice a lot of hot air Talk about settling return soldiers etc and anticipation of teaching them How to Cook on a "good" stove.I think the average soldier only wants peace & quiet in his own congenial surroundings.We are getting some extra Tucker for the men from the Canal, but the looting is as bad as Gallipoli.
We are gathering in all the Bedouins & their flocks   One little homeless 12 year old, was brought in with 10 goats.  She would not leave them & the boys gathered round & gave her biscuits Tea & Bully & would not allow a goat to be Killed.  Later she went on to the concentration camp with 50 Piastre for each goat.
