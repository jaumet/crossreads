I walked to the Church at Cholderton to'ther Sunday.  Lord Nelson lived right opposite.  There is an old stone Saxon Font in the Church Yard.  The carved seats, each one of a different design &amp; all of old oak, &amp; the carved ceiling is one of the best in England.  The original Church fell to Pieces.  Mosely [Rev. Thomas Mozley] by writing &amp; with the help of several wealthy donors was able to erect the Church.  The Donors have all been remembered for the coat of arms of each one is placed in a conspicuos place in the Church.  The old Manor House at the back of the Church no longer stands, but the Trees of the Drive still stand in their rows.  Wm. Prince of Orange was entertained there on His way to London.  Now my dear ones, I must try &amp; answer some of my letters.
We are both well although Ellis is tired to-night &amp; is reading the Papers Dad sent Him in bed.
Best of Love to all the Neighbours &amp; our Relatives &amp; to my Dear Friends Mr. &amp; Mrs. Stephen &amp; Allison.
