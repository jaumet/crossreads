<p>dance &amp; had a real good evening, spoilt later by someone stealing my hat, a real good one I had bought myself.</p>
<p>Tuesday 18th   Up early &amp; had a bath &amp; early breakfast.  At 8.30. 41 of us all told set off for London where we changed to Fenchurch St. Station. Had 3 hours in London &amp; I bought a few things I wanted as films etc.  We found our ship the Kildonan Castle at the Albert Docks &amp; were well pleased with her appearance over 9000 tons all fitted out anew, she having been used as an auxiliary cruiser during the War.  Very cold and dreary weather.  No special accommodation for Sgts or W.O.'s so told the Adj. I expected something.  Nothing doing as yet because we are taking passengers to Alexandria .  Spent a good night on one of the hospital beds.</p>
