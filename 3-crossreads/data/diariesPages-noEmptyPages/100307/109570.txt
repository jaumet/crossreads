Amiens/Albert
14/3/17
To Hotel Belfort at about 3.45 am and turned in between the sheets for a short rest having coffee in bed and completing bath and shave before 10. A rainy and muddy morning. At the station was informed with true English bovine politeness that the Albert train goes at 5.40 tomorrow morning. Took a short constitutional round the streets and had another look at the Cathedral - small after Notre Dame. Returning to hotel collected baggage and took train to the Barrier and at once was fortunate in catching a motor lorry which gave me a jolty ride in Albert. 
To the YMCA Club near the Church for lunch ? a good lunch and then tried to find our post office but it has already moved on ahead. Phoned for horse and it arrived in charge of Snowdon at 6 pm and we then proceeded to the transport lines Slept with Evanston in comfortable quarters turning in on a palliasse on the floor some horse blankets.
