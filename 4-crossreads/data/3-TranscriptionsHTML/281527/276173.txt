<p>5/3/18  Flixecourt</p>
<p>Up early and breakfasted. A dull cold day. To the parade ground and saw the whole School fallen in to the ruffle of drums. Band &amp; pipers played during the inspection. All NCOs and officers and the parade was rather a good sight. A march past followed &ndash; there are a number of Americans here. We then inspected the bayonet work and other items before going back to the Chateau for lunch. Inspected the Lance Corporals platoon after lunch and they drilled very smartly indeed under the Adjutant &ndash; a  Major of the Guards. These Guardsmen are good chaps and all affect a certain type of looks &amp; dress.</p>
