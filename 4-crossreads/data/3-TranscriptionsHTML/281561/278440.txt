Are not expecting to stay here long; we will move either forward or back. So I spent the evening in Popperinghe.<br/>13/10/17.<br/>Having an easy time, with Bathing Parades and light drill. Was on guard last night a wild, wet one too. Have received 3 parcels; 1 registered, from Nell. The Huns bomb this area. Particularly the Hospitals near Popperinghe; we  have him over almost every night.</p>
