 1917 JANUARY 
 6 SATURDAY 
 Fine, but dull & cold. Cleaning 
 harness all day, & I was on 
 line picket. There is more 
 mud round those horse lines 
 than I ever saw on the plains 
 at home. Some of the 26 th  Bat. 
 moved to another billet & we have 
 a bit more room now. They opened  
 a battery canteen in the billet 
 tonight.
