<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Probably you have recieved a letter from Miss Astin, telling you I had left for France again. If I had taken her advice I should still be in England. She did everything possible to prevent me coming to France again. I sent you a postcard from Folkstone, telling you I was on my way to the Battalion again. I have been with the Battalion a week now, and have just got accustomed to the rough life again I was very pleased to be at them again.<br/>The square heads are getting jip now. Tell all my friends to address my letters to the Battalion now. You should have been to the send off they gave me at Rollestone. The best affair I have ever been to in my life. They did pay me some compliments. The way the fighting is now I don't expect it will be long before I am back in Eng again. Will write at every opportunity. Hoping you are all well. Best wishes &amp; love<br/>Your loving son<br/>Tom</p>
