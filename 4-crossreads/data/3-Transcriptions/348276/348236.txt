<p>War Diary<br/>1915  20th Oct.<br/>and Battle Ship &ndash; all very quiet -  Last night's patrol brought in 3 rifles and a pay book evidently belonging to men who were killed early in August (Wiltshire Regt.);  an unexploded Turk bomb, curious pattern, thrown into lines long range &ndash; 9" brass cylinder x 3" diameter with 3 half sticks of Curtiss and Harvey's Dynamite at base unexploded &ndash; Top blown off by percussion fuse;  - only one found so far.<br/>Sir Ian Hamilton C. in-C. handed over to Gen, Monro &ndash; No doubt result of the horrible failure at Sufla, where 60000 men were held up by 3 Coys.

S.K. &ndash; that the trenches were full; that they were also</p>
