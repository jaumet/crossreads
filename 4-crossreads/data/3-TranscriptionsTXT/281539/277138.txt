 3/9/15 About 20 men over the side swimming &ndash; "gib it, gib it baksheesh Australia very good very nice 
 4/9/15  Men in swimming, lowered boat in case of accidents. Marvellous physique; splendid specimens all of them, Much afraid the report of Bdiers death only too true. We may land here and reorganize.  Things very quiet aboard nothing to do. We are to expect 2 hours notice to disembark. Rumoured that 8000 Aust. Are being sent back from Anzac on account of water shortage The Aquitania has just pulled in packed with some of Kitcheners army on her somewhere over 5000 on board. The tonnage of the ships in harbour must be very large. This is a delightful spot with its villages nestling among the trees and the white camps on the rises. The green slopes rising gently from the water's edge. The water as calm as a pond and everything quiet and peaceful and yet outside are the fighting tops of French &amp; British war ships and the roar of the guns can be faintly heard near the trenches 4 hours away
