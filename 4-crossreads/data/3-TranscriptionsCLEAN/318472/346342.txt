  
 27 April 1918 Saturday Went to Salisbury in the afternoon per motor. A very warm pleasant afternoon. Had a fairly good time in town. Went to a couple of show which were fairly good. 
 1918 April 28 Sunday A cold miserable day. Still working in the Canteen. Nothing of particular importance going except that things are still going against us at the Front.
