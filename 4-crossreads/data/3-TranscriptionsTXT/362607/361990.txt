Bulford14.10.17Dear Dad,I have had rather a strenuous day today so I'll only write a P.C. each. It has been a lovely day & Norm Upton that I used to work with at D.J's was over to see me. I was orderly Corporal today but I went put/ We walked back to Cholderton 4 miles away & arrived back just in time for tea. I had to go on Duty till 6.30 pm then. After that time we had a game of snooker which I won by just sinking the "Black". then supper, & walked half way home with him. Altogether have walked 14 miles since 3 pm. It was lovely walking but I don't walk very much & by the time I got back I was just beginning to feel the strain. Ellis has gone to Sarum. I am on Duty till 11 pm to-night. He will be Home before that time. I met Stewart Rose again yesterday. I was sent to His Camp on a Dchx but there was no one there. He was marching along the road when I saw him.  Love From  Harry
