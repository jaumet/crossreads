Monday June 12th 
trenches: showery all day: usual shells: got a letter from J.B.J. J.O.Donnel. anne Jack: They were very acceptable newsy: told off for wire work but it did not come off: warned that the 1st Bgde were having a "stunt" to be prepared for artillery fire: about 11.45 pm heavy rifle machine gun fire was on round that way: it was raining bitterly cold all day: 
Tuesday June 13th 
trenches: showery bitterly cold all day: at 12.25 am the artillery opened up: Fritz sent up his red flares also some green "showers" but his guns were a little while in replying: we only got the tail end some "whizz" shrapnel: most of the time we were looking over the parapet it was a nice sight: D. Coy lost a few men: poor old Fritz is getting a shake up lately but he started these games is getting paid in his own coin: These Aust's are undoubtedly hard doers: when anyone gets killed it is just a passing comment "poor B---" or some other phrase: read an account of the 7th raid the men are now in London on leave: Bert got a parcel we had a "beano":- pudding, tinned fruit lollies which went very good: went out "Listening" 9.30 pm till 11.45 pm it was a wet miserable job:
