 14.11.16  Tuesday 
 We passed another terror of a night &amp; it is still continuing during the day. Shells are falling fast &amp; furious &amp; to speak the truth, they have us fairly bluffed. Under cover of a fog Fritz has sneaked a couple of long range guns up &amp; is peppering us properly. At 6.30 pm last night our guns opened up a terrific bombardment &amp; kept it going  the greater part of the night. Regular sleeping was impossible &amp; one could only catch alternate intervals between the tremendous roars of the big guns. Unofficial news came to hand that we had captured Letransley but is not yet confirmed. 
 The early part of the morning was not quite so bad but it opened up at dinner time again. A very bitter pill for us to swallow is the fact that Fritz has a couple of observation balloons up which can observe our positions, &amp; we are sure to feel the effects of his observations tonight. Already he has commenced by putting over a few haphazard shots, but they are too close to be comforting. 
 The planes are out in hundreds &amp; wherever you look, you can see little puffs of smoke which denotes bursting shells. 
 One plane was brought down in flames but I do not know whose it was. It fell in the German Lines. 
 Traffic is still congested &amp; I do not think it will be right again until warm weather sets in &amp; dries the roads
