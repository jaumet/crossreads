<p>I wonder father, how you like being at home. I suppose you are at the garden &amp; stone walls again. Don't forget to pull any grass out of the court. It's not worth doing anything else, but the grass will get a hold. I'm hoping for some more letters soon, our mail has been held up for some reason. The last ones were dated about Jan 20th. But they are all arriving safely enough. I wonder how the wee nephew is. And dear Billy. Do get him to write to me again &amp; draw a picture of Alan Oliver. I don't know when I will see Olly again, it was great luck in being near him for a while. I have had several good evenings with Noel.</p>
<p>I do hope the family has settled down again, &amp; mother is not working too hard. She must go steady now.</p>
<p>Give my love to them all. &amp; tell them I'm always thinking of the old home.</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
