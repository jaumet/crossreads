2nd October, 1917.
Spent a couple of days preparing for the line. Have been instructed in the coming stunt. We of the 3rd Battalion will be "Right on the Line" and the first wave of attack. It has been quiet here except that the hun's bombing machines come over and make the night hideous. Have received a fat mail of letters and parcels. We move up to the line tonight.

Came into this rotten possie on Anzac Ridge last night. An old waterlogged trench. Intermittant shelling all day. He is wearing a new brand of frightfulness liberally here; the "mustard gas" shell. It is not dangerous till he puts ?em in thick. He also used the incendiary shells to light up our roads, so that his bombing planes can see to shoot at night. We go over the top in the morning to take Broodseinde Ridge.
