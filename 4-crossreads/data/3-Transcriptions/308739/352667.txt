<p>Thursday 2 March 1916<br/>Heavy Winds commenced today, terrible weather.<br/>Regiment on Parade.<br/>By Toast if this is the sort of Life we are to lead here one would rather be turned into Rock at once.  My eyes, mouth, Hair, Clothes &amp;amp; every thing inside &amp;amp; out is full of Grit.  The food is like eating so much Sand paper, &amp;amp; the days ends with winds abating &amp;amp; men cursing.</p>
<p>Friday 3 March 1916<br/>Heavy Winds blowing.  Received letters from Home dated 26-1-16.<br/>Regiment drilling.  Yes another day has dawned &amp;amp; with it more wind.  The Regiment does Mounted Parade, but I think they get behind some cover &amp;amp; rest, as it is impossible to drill.<br/>The Canal is about 1&frac12; miles away, &amp;amp; arrangements are being made to let the men go over swimming.</p>
<p>Saturday 4 March 1916<br/>Regiment cleaning up Camp &amp;amp; Swimming.<br/>Col. Fuller in Camp all Day.  Oh the Luxury of water to wash away the muck of the past week.  Both Officers &amp;amp; Men avail themselves of the priviledge of the Salt Water &amp;amp; spend as much time as possible on the Canal Banks.  The Colonel can get a good supply of water now for Himself which is most valuable.<br/>Our Mess consists of H.Q. Officers &amp;amp; with the assistance of Ted Reed together with the Serg Cook we managed to get a fair supply of food for them.  One of us go into Ismaila alternate days for Green Stuff &amp;amp; Tomatos, &amp;amp; also take the Washing to be done there.  It costs each Officer about 100 P.T. a week not including Liquor.<br/>Our Rations consist now of Fresh Bread, Meat &amp;amp; Vegetables.</p>
