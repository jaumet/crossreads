<p>two days &amp; nights. On the night of the 28th I was sent in charge of a party to carry material for making underground dug outs to No 1 Canadian Tunnelling company who were engaged in this occupation. During the morning of the 29th with other N.C.Os I went to have a look round the front line especially the part our company was to occupy when their turn arrived. This part of the line consisted of several big mine craters which we were told had been blown by the enemy but had afterwards fallen into our hands. The position was very interesting but still very dangerous everyone having to remain as quiet as possible both day &amp; night for their own safety for the Huns were only thirty yards away. The garrison of the place consisted of small sentry posts on the further lip of the mine craters with strict instructions to remain perfectly quiet &amp; to observe any enemy movements that may be seen. After having a good look right round the battalion Front &amp; making notes of same we returned to our company having nothing more to do that day. During the night of 30th September the 7th Battalion "Raiding Party" about thirty men raided the enemy front line which proved fairly successful for they brought back several prisoners &amp; only suffered very few casualties. The raid took place after a fairly heavy bombardment by our artillery &amp; trench mortars which caused Fritz to retaliate making things very warm while it lasted. Next day October 1st we received orders to put all watches back one hour for the daylight saving stunt which affected the soldiers as well as the civilians. That same day I was detailed in charge of an engineers fatigue party on revetting a communication trench called "Lovers Lane" it being well named for Fritz had a great liking for it, for he never forgot to give it, its daily issue of shells &amp; trench mortars.</p>
