  
 Whether he's been having a fast time in Paris I don't know. 
 I am leaving this place, no nothing wrong but it rather got on my nerves, especially the continual dragging about. 
 I tried to manoeuvre a move to London but it was beyond me & I seem to have succeeded in manoeuvring myself figuratively speaking into the mud.  I expect I'll land back in the D.A.C. a Corporal & with a new Boss & possibly a new job & (more than likely an outside & more strenuous one) I don't foresee a pleasant near future.  However I can but go on till I drop.  War is hell my dear. 
 I haven't seen anything of Duncan or Kirby but they are not far off. 
 I have been wondering how your trip has been going & whether you liked Singapore &
