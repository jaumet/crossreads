  
 We ran a draw for second place. 
 Saturday. 14.9.18 Demonstration of cooperation of infantry weapons. Most interesting & instructive. Left at 11am & walked to Rue for train to Boulougne. Rained when we got to Boulougne & didn't stop till Sunday morning. Hardaker & I strolled around a bit. Had dinner at the club & then did some more strolling. Met Os. Charlton & had a good old talk of Sydney days. He goes on leave tomorrow to Blighty. 
 Sunday 15.9.18. Went to church. Gee it is the first time for years. Took communion too. Real bonny day. Had all our meals at the club. Lunch at the new one & the others at the old one. Get served quicker there (by french  girls while the new one is by Waacs.) & went out to the Dublin Rest Camp in the afternoon & saw some boxing. Bandsman Rice & Jimmy Drison
