<p>We caught a Remora or Sucking fish this morng  -  He was slate colored &ndash; about 2 feet long &amp; had an oval sucking disc about 5 <strike>"</strike> inches by 2 <strike>5</strike> on the back of his Cephalothorax  -  (combined Head &amp; chest) There is much difference of opinion as to whether he is edible  -  One remark was that he was too much like a shark to be good eating though I believe young shark is not bad  -  Personally I don't want either  -  Fishing has been a dead failure &ndash; here &amp; at Ribaul &amp; in the coral sea  -  The natives in Fiji fish out by the reef at night time but no boat may leave the wharf after Sunset is the Flagship's order &amp; so we don't get fresh fish  -  I saw yesterday the long nosed form of the Garfish swing alongside &amp; this morng  -  a Bonito was chasing small fry  -  The morng  -  &amp; eveng  -  are perfection  -  At <strike>the</strike> sunset the West streams gold over the heavens &amp; the sun goes down in a golden chariot  -  Midday is hot but all around its glorious stimulating champagne weather &amp; so we end week 10 of war <u>time</u></p>
