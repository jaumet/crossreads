Wednesday 9th May   Handed over my duties altho' final orders for the move have not yet arrived.  Weather fine.  Papers give a slight British reverse also news of the Nationalist Party's win in Australia.  Had a go at cricket also at Badminton the Q.M. producing a set, some game.  Mail from Australia more papers than letters for me however.  Our deaths in last stunt now total 4, all fine fellows two of my section & two being orderlys for the Sgt's mess.  My section suffered the worst as usual.Thursday 10th May   Fine day, rain in the evening.
