  
 so proceeded on. It appears he was 15 hours in the water before being rescued viz. 8 hrs on the machine which was kept up on its floats then sank. So seeing the position hopeless he cut his patrol tank adrift & plugged all the connections & made it air tight so floated on this for 7 hours. Another convoy passed & one of the steamers 1/2 a mile off took him to be a German submarine & fired 6 rounds of shells from their 6 inch gun. So the airman exhausted after being in the water 15 hours & soaking wet took off his shirt & waved it. Finally a distroyer came over & saved him. Now at the hospital & doing well. It appears this distroyer took him to be a sub & rushed over with the intention of dropping a depth charge.
