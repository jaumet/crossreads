  Bailleul  
 5/7/16 
 We passed the 2nd Casualty Clearing Station outside which was a great fleet of ambulances. An excellent officers tea room is close handy where we had afternoon tea and later a great dinner of asparagus strawberries &amp;c. Unearthed a branch of Burberrys and also another officers clothing place very reasonable in prices. 
 The Tommies about were mostly ASC &amp;c. &amp; very slack saluters. Going in we passed a few brothels. 
 Bed early.

 8/7/16 
 Early morning received orders to move. Roads very slippery for the horse. We shall be very sorry to leave here as the little place is so pleasant and quiet. The thick grass underfoot everywhere is just like a carpet &ndash; soft and springy.
