<p>Friday 21st June 1917 [1918]<br/>&frac12; day &amp; go out to Pyramids with Cpl. Shaw, poor old man he coughs &amp; is very bent &amp; weak after his illness, photos, then tea at Mena House, then long enjoyable evening lying on the hot sands &amp; watching the colors in the sky &amp; the Sphinx in the moonlight &amp; dreaming &amp; all it has seen in the long past ages.  Home by last tram 11.10 p.m. &amp; find everyone has been looking for me to say may stay in bed more, so no more shall I go on duty in the 27th G.H. &amp; what a lot I have learned here, not in nursing but other things.  (Saturday 22nd), cont. from overleaf.  Moonlight donkey stunt to [indecipherable].  24 of us &amp; how we enjoyed it all, playing 2 &amp; 3's round the old obelisk in the warm evening air &amp; flying in a car along the fine roads with lebbek [also spelt lebbeck] trees on either side.</p>
