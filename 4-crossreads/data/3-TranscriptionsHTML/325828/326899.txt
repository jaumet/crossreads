<p>My dearest Olwen<br/>Just a very hurried note from above place.  We left Serapeum on Monday &amp; are now at the docks at Alexandria waiting for the Boat to sail.  We have got all our horses on &amp; harness on &amp; boat (Knight Templar (Z49) expects to sail 5 pm.  Destination unknown but everything points to Marseilles, especially as we have been issued with Gas Helmets for Asphyxiating Gases.  Keeping Well.  Please tell W. L. W if you receive this, &amp; might mention it home if you think of it.  Left Cairo on Friday night at 7.15 pm &amp; arrived at Serapeum at 2.30 A.M.  Very cold indeed open truck.  Lot of artillery going same boat as us, one of our cousins too: I heard his name W--------- called out<br/>Must close    Will write when possible    Excuse haste<br/>Love,<br/>Leo</p>
