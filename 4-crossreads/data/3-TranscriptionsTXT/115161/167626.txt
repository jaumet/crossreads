 While some men dug, others would &quot;line&quot; the parapet to watch the movement of the enemy. 
 The portion of the trench that I was in was really a sunken road, the sides of which sloped up to the higher land on either side.&nbsp; The side up which we had to climb to &quot;line the parapet&quot; was very much knocked about by our shell-fire, which made it very hard work to secure a firm footing owing to the slippery nature of the clayey soil.
