<p>day &amp; rumour has it that we already have Bapaume. Most startling news was Russian revolution another illustration of how the people are blinded to real happenings. 'Tis to be hoped that the dinkum war party are in power. Received orders suddenly today to close down our station &amp; move a couple of miles further ahead a good indication of the advance.</p>
<p>Sunday 18th March<br/>In a dinkum advance at last. Up early packed the waggons etc. &amp; went about 3 miles out. Everywhere was the spirit of advance in the air. How far Fritz had retreated we did not know but he was still sending shells overhead so knew he was not too far away. Even the balloons moved ahead it being a good sight to see the huge bag being carried along the road, fully inflated, by about 40 men, led by a Lieutenant &amp; followed by the car &amp; telephone etc.</p>
