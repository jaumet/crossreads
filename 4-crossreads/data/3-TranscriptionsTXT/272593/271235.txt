 I am writing tonight in a nice comfortable room belonging to the French people where we are billeted, there is a nice fire going in the room &amp; we have chairs lamps &amp; a table &amp; everything is nice &amp; cosy   outside it is cold &amp; the hail is falling thick &amp; heavy, &amp; both combined makes one think of the poor devils in the trenches &amp; also of our  fair   far away homes, where at this present time the sun is shining   it is now about 8 oclock in the evening here &amp; as there is nearly 10 hours difference in the time I guess the sun is shining alright, thats what we miss I think as much as anything the nice warm sun, we very seldom see it now &amp; when we do it is very pale &amp; sickly looking &amp; not the slightest sign of heat in it
