  
 4/2/19 Gourdinne More snow this morning. I went round the billets we are giving to the 23rd. with Hughes. Just before lunch they marched in and were soon settled down. Jack and Beith came and had lunch with me. Latest rumours seem to indicate that our next draft will be postponed. After lunch I had the greatest difficulty in tearing myself away from a good fire and going out for a walk. With a climate such as this I don't wonder that the Belgians lead such a very sedentary life. Took a half an hour stroll along snow covered roads and over snow carpeted fields. Thin powdery flakes keep gently drifting down. Spent the evening reading until 9.30 and then had a yarn with the Crochelet family.
