IVGardens & is going to send you some - Her husband could have got us  trip out to the fleet but time was too short -  After lunch we went over the City visiting Sir Walter Scotts monument in Princes St and Edinburgh Castle, the Barracks of the Royal Scots - we then walked along the High St past John Knox's house to Holly Rood Castle, the Royal Seat in Edinburgh - By this time it was dark & wended our way home feeling that our trip to Edinburgh had been well
