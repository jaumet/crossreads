<p>SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Turned all my horses</p>
<p>into wheat paddock in morning</p>
<p>Tickle lopped in Top paddock &amp;</p>
<p>drew water for Darby. Al &amp; Jo</p>
<p>went to Coomoo Coomoo for</p>
<p>the day. I went into QuIrindi</p>
<p>to go on to Taree&nbsp;re some</p>
<p>grass for the cattle but found</p>
<p>there was no train, so came home again.</p>
