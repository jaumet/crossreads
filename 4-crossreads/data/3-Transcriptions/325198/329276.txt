<p>24 March, 1916<br/>Gabul Mirium<br/>The Doctor came out this morning &amp; told us that he thought we would be relieved to morrow so a general downcastedness is upon us.  We have been having a happy go lucky life here not a care &amp; little duty. During the day we cast aside clothes for the greatest party of the day, a hat &amp; a towel being considered ample attire when a boat is passing by, it is only when the signallers give us the office that the Major, Col or the General that there is a general putting on of clobber.  I wonder what they would think if we presented arms dressed in towels &amp; hats &ndash; It livens one up to see the boats passing occasionally &amp; I don't know how we are going to carry all, our tobacco &amp; cigarettes back.  Johno is telling me about Flanagan &amp; is amused about his phrases "Let Gone bye be Gone bye" says Flan.  Flanagan has also been a butcher we have learned he carried the basket round for a few months.</p>
