The fare is 1/6.  When we got through the main part of the city we came out on to the New Road to Rondebosch. It circles round the side of Table Mount and the Devils Peak, and a splendid view of the Harbour, Robin Island a range of mountains in the distance, Mt. Wellington's snowy head showing in all its beauty. A fine view of the city and suburbs below can also be seen. We followed this road for 6 miles,</p>
