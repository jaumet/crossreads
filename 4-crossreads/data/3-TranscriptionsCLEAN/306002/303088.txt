  
 26.3.15 Fri. 26th.  Left Maadi at 8.30 this morning, we had hardly enough bread for breakfast, & took none with us for dinner.  Fighting Charlie Cox came along a few miles with us about midday we met the New Zealanders, & had to fight them on an empty stomach before we could get into camp, we arrived here about 3 o'clock & had a few biscuits before "stables", needless to say we did justice to an excellent stew for tea.  I put the night in writing home, & was feeling too lazy to do much, was on the feeding party at 9 o'clock.
