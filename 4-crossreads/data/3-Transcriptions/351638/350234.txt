<p>fresh Landing was made at Suvla Bay.  I was told on the Afternoon of August 6th, to go on board the S.S. Minneapolis, which would sail sometime during the night. The Minneapolis is a huge Atlantic Transport Liner, employed in the cargo trade, but also having very comfortable accomodation for a large number of First and Second Class Passengers.

I found an eighteen pounder Gun, suspended in mid-air, and about to be lowered onto the heads of my two Friends, and our precious Baggage. In the darkness the Quarter-Master in charge, had mistaken our Tug for a Barge which was coming to take off a Battery which had to be landed with the Troops at dawn. I was just in time to save my Friend, Henry Nevinson, and the Press Officer Major Delme Radcliffe, and our Bag-</p>
