side is frozen solid. There are blocks of ice in the shell holes six feet thick, and everything is as still as the South Pole.
1st February. 1917.
A quiet day and night but it is frightfully cold. Twenty degrees of frost I am told. Our musical Huns in the post opposite had booze; they were very jovial, one waved a bottle at us inviting us to drink. There is one strand of barbed wire stretched along the middle of No Mans Land to prevent eitherside from getting lost this snow is very confusing. This is a most extraordinary sector, here we stand all night in full view of the Fritz's, yet we dare not shoot at him or he at us. I hope to hear the Bosches sing the Hymn of Hate, before I go away from here.
