<p>13.10.15<br/>Wed 13th<br/>Had a fraud of a mail in this morning &amp; did not go around to the 'phone box, but took a dozen sand bags around this afternoon &amp; finished off any work that can be done in the day time; Nelson was knocking about again to-day so he cannot be too bad; One of the B Sqd Sigs went sick this morning &amp; I got McDonald of A Sqd to take his place; one of our aeroplanes appeared to be in difficulties this afternoon &amp; was volplaning down &amp; and came very low over the Turks trenches, The  Turks opened a heavy rifle and machine gun fire on her; the 'plane eventually landed on the beach &amp; the aviator &amp; pilot had to run for cover as the Turks peppered it with shrapnel, it landed near Suvla Bay.</p>
