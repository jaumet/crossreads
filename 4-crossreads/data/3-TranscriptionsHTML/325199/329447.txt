<p>Saturday morning June 3/16<br/>A wet march into Seymour to catch 6.15 train to city. Said Good Bye to Lizzie and steamed out of Seymour. Arrived at Flinders St safely &amp; hence on to Port Melbourne Pier about 9. Had lunch &amp; roll call and went on board about 11. Sailed out from the pier about 1 p.m. amid the cheers of a large crowd. Had dinner about 1.30. Wrote 2 letters as we steamed down the bay and posted them with the pilot when he left us outside the Heads at 5 o'clock.</p>
<p>Sunday, June 4. 1916<br/>Sick all day, a very rough sea. Passed Cape Bridgewater early in the morning about 7.</p>
<p>Monday June 5. 1916<br/>Sick again today but not quite so bad as yesterday. Sea still very rough.</p>
<p>Tuesday June 6. 1916<br/>A little better today, had some breakfast &amp; dinner. The medicine I got last evening &amp; this morning from the doctor done me a lot of good.</p>
