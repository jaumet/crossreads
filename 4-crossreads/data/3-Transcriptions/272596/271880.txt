<p>21st. There was a farewell concert given last night but the showers spoilt it a bit.</p>
<p>It is simply a glorious morning &amp; I &amp; a few others have been stretched out full length on the deck "forrard" this is the best part of the ship for it is always clean &amp; there is no vibration on it or traffic, we have been talking over all sorts of topics as is usual when men get together but it nearly always turns on prospects to when we get our discharge &amp; about marrying &amp; settling down,  we practically agree that we have had enough knocking about but when to marry seems the biggest problem for all of us to settle &amp; some of the arguments brought forward are very funny,   I guess when all said &amp; done all plans will go overboard &amp; we will act on</p>
