 March 1917 19th continued   around here is in a far better state than the country we have been in of late.   The difference is marked after one leaves Fritz's late support trenches.   The ground between Millers Son &amp; Fritzs third line is literally strewn with dead, &amp; presents a gastly sight- beyond description.   Fritz has left a terrible lot of material behind him, but it can be noticed throughout the village &amp; surrounding country, where he has piled the stuff in heaps &amp; attempted to burn it. The weather has been bad lately &amp; to-day a strong S.W. wind has been blowing, &amp; at about tea time it started to rain &amp; continued steadily throughout the night.
