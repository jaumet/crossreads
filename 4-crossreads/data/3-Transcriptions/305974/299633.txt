<p>27 Thursday<br/>For the last few mornings it has been very foggy; the fog rising about 8.30 am.  Doing Guard duty until 6 pm, it is a very easy job, but somewhat monotonous.  Paid 30/- being 11/- overpaid (it will hurt to cut that out).  A good bit of boozing up, windows in two huts being broke through fighting.  Went into Tidworth for photographic goods in evening.</p>
<p>28 Friday<br/>Rather a very hot day. doing stretcher drill all the morning &amp; went on a route march in the afternoon, we didn't go very far, far enough though to make our feet sore wearing the new boots we were issued with the other day.  The leave I put in for last Wednesday was cancelled so I have to wait until next time.</p>
<p>29 Saturday<br/>We have to be up to time here now, when reveille goes in the morning &amp; have our beds &amp; blankets folded before first parade.  On scrubbing out the hut all morning.  Printing photos all the afternoon.  done up all my negatives to send home.</p>
<p>30 Sunday<br/>Went to church in the morning &amp; over to the airodrome in the evening, we had the ill luck not to be able to go up, so all we could do was to look on.  We got back about 10 pm very tired.</p>
