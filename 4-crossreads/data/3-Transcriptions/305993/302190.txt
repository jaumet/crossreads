<p>with mail from Australia so that our mail being there would be sent to Cairo &amp; we leaving today would not receive same for another 3 weeks.  At 2 p.m. we passed the Brothers Lt. Ho. &amp; Reef &amp; at 9 p.m. Daedlus [Daedalus] Reef Lt. house.  We signalled the H.M.T. Ormond from Bombay with a 1000 soldiers &amp; their wives on board from India to England on leave.  The day before we left Suez the Canberra left for Bombay empty going to be fitted out there for returned garrison soldiers &amp; their wives &amp; children.  The Katoomba also left the day before us full of Indian troops from Constantinople for Bombay.  We have only 12 Civilian passengers on board the rest being Soldiers &amp; Prisnors of War.  Our Indian crew are rejoicing at going to India &amp; there the whole of our crew will be paid off &amp; discharged &amp; a new crowd taken on.  A concert was held in the 1st Class Social hall in which the majority attended &amp; enjoyed them selves.  One of the Flying Corp Lieut. is a professional conjuror &amp; was exceedingly smart at that class of work &amp; highly amused the Troops.  Whilst at Suez we painted our two funnels the Company's color, but had no time to Paint the Company's color outside.  The majority of the Transports are painted their respective company's color now.  We appear quite different now after being painted fighting grey color for 18 months.</p>
