This afternoon the wife came along & told me all about the Bairn   I go out to Heliopolis tomorrow to see them.  She is fit & well- I hope the Photos arrive of the KIDDY.  I am here for a few days & will then get 14 days leave with Dolly instead of going to a Convalescent Home.  Cabled you tonight FLOURISHING CAIRO   I hope you understand X
