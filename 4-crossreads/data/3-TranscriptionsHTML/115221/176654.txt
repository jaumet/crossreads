<p>I do not know if you have heard from anyone in this Bn. and I felt it my duty to inform you of how your brave son, and my mate gave his life for his King and Country.</p>
<p>I fully realise the severe blow you have received in losing a good son, but I trust that the way in which he gave his life, that it will help you considerably to bear your grief and sorrow.  I will not attempt to give you any news at the present time, only that I am in good health.</p>
<p>Kindly accept my deepest sympathy,<br/>I remain, yours sincerely,<br/>Wal Court</p>
