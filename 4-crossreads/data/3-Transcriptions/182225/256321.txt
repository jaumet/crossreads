<p>72</p>
<p>JULY &nbsp; FRIDAY 21 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>A beautiful warm day. About 70 of the Battery went on leave. The leave is badly managed as you only get four days including traveling to &amp; from camp &amp; it does not matter where you are going you have to go up to London first. I was an incinerator man for the day it is a good job. Got a cable from Linda to say all well.</p>
