<p>July 19th  1915.<br/>My dearest Mother<br/>I have just heard that a mail leave for Australia soon so must scribble a few hurried lines. Hope we shall get one to-day. I am very well &amp; happy. Night-duty is not too bad, &amp;  I'm sleeping rather well.<br/>No doubt you will be surprised to hear that Fred Hutching took me out to Shepherd's for afternoon tea    &amp; then a lovely motor drive on Friday last, he wants me to try and get a late night, so that I can have dinner with him &amp; then go to the Theatre. He is a Major now &amp;  looks very well. We had quite an enjoyable time together, left family relations alone. There is such a lot of interesting subjects to talk about, that one does not think of small things. <br/>I went out to the Museum on Saturday &amp; we had a very good time. Yesterday we stayed    <strike>h</strike> in bed most of day &amp; then cleaned up our room. We have had great excitement these last few days 19 sisters &amp; 10 doctors arrived from Australia. Hope we will get a little more time off. <br/>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. From                                                                                                                                Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                                                                Edith.</p>
