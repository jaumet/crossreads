<p>Needle Trench<br/>24/12/16 Early up and round. Only a few scattered shells. A fine day and all the fellows working like bees with timber and iron to get comfortable. By 10 a.m. most of them were in fairly good "bivvies" and quite at home. Under the parapet of some rear trenches noticed about 6 dead men all rotting in the mud in a heap &ndash; whether our own or the Germans it was impossible to say. Ordered them to be covered over with mud and a cross put up. Although there was a great deal of movement there was no shelling. Stayed below in dugout most of the afternoon and had all the officers seeing to their mens feet &ndash; rubbing and seeing them chafed. Colonel Smith to 5th Bde today and Forbes in his place. Went over and saw Duggan in the evening and found him 50 feet underground and eat some of his Xmas cake. Fogarty Joe's wedding day today. Inf. came in that a relief was suspected so we switched the artillery on and heavily shelld Fritz's roads &amp; approaches. A good bombardment saw Xmas Eve out.</p>
