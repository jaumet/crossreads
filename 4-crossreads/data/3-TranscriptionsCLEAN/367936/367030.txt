  
 Saturday 26 August 1916 Wrote to Father (13). West & I were put on fatigue at Canteen picking up empty beer bottles and packing them in cases.  Thorpe & Dawson out on a stunt over the old battle field.  On Canteen guard all the evening. 
 Sunday 27 August 1916 Canteen guard all day.  Some gentleman thought he had a better right to my camera & compas than I did so took it out of my haversack. Taube flew round.
