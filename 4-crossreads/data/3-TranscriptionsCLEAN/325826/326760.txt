3.  let me interrupt myself, for since I wrote that word the servant came & handed me a letter that absolutely amazed me & I'll tell you about it.  It was in Leo's writing & was re-addressed here from Alexandria.  When I opened it I found that it was from Ma'adi and dated 11th. January, 11th January if you please & this is 13th April, doesn't it make one mad, and yet it is just like them over here.     In it he acknowledged my first note & the socks I posted on arrival & mentioned his whereabouts &c.  Also he gave his new address "Driver" & without Reinforcements &c, so that explains all the difficulty I had in getting letters & telegrams to him when we came to Cairo and tried to find him.  I have looked carefully at it & it was addressed correctly c/o of Rid and posted or stamped on 14th. Jan, so that all the delay has been in the post.  That is a sample of the sublime postal arrangements over here & I have heard of one or two others from acquaintances that are nearly parallel.          What I was going to tell you when I was interrupted so "interestingly" was, that the day before yesterday an English mail came in & one or two people here had letters so that I immediately began to watch hard for one from Rid for that is the mail that would bring their letters from Marseilles.   There was also an unusual Australian mail delivered & there wasn't a thing for me by that either & I knew there was a week before the next English mail & ten days for the Australian so I retired, a saddened , chastened woman, do you think I'll survive it?Now I want to talk to you again about that cable you sent me and about my future movements.     I badly wanted to send you a return one right away but then remembered that I might only have to send another to countermand it if I did anything too hastily & I have hoped as the days have been going by without
