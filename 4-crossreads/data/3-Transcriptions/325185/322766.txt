<p>France<br/>14.1.17</p>
<p>Dear Father<br/>You will wonder what has happened that I haven't written lately. I am in France again as you will see have been back about a month now. The conditions present arent the best for letter writing it is so cold. Well we are just out of the line again are back for a bit of a spell. Needless to say it isent too warm. We had a fall of snow one night while we were in the line by gum it was cold I thought I would never get warm again. It is very miserable here now what with wet weather mud etc one has rather a rough time but I dare say we shall pull through alright our casualities were next to nil this time we fared very well.</p>
