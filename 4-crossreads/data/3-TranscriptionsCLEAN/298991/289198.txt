  
 Wednesday August 8th Was up early on account of having to go to Weymouth this morning. Said good bye to all my pals. Left Parkhouse about 8.30 am & walked to Tidworth where we caught a train to Andover. After waiting about forty minutes, we caught a train for Salisbury. We (Three privates & a staff sergeant) had two hours & a half at Salisbury, so we had a good look round the town. It is a fair sized place & seems to be well populated. M.Ps. did not trouble us at all for our passes. We caught a train from Salisbury at 1.20 pm for Poole, where we had to again change. Couldn't see much of Poole, as it was raining fairly hard, all the time we were there. 
 Arrived at Weymouth about 4.30 pm.  They  There was a big crowd of Australians off the same train, some coming from hospital, furlough, & duty. They were all fallen in & marched to Monte Video Camp. We (the staff sergeant was in the know here, with some of the officers) caught a motor & paid our fare, it was 1/-, so it was the cheapest in the end, as lumping two packs four miles is no joke. Alloted to huts (Tempory), after arrival here, also went through medical inspection. They are the biggest humbugs of fellows here. I have ever seen, it was fully ten o'clock, when we got back to our huts. They have wire  mattresses  beds, good mattresses but only three blankets. Still raining this evening.
