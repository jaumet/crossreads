We had about two hours duty every day on the phone at HQ orderly room. When first I took my shift, I found that the man on duty at Brigade HQ was Fred Fowler who was an old cobber of mine at Kings School. The whole Brigade was supposed to move to a back area for a rest but for some reason or other it was postponed. Oct 31 On 31st Oct my 22nd birthday came and went. I celebrated it with Tom McCann and Heslewood by splashing through thick mud in the dark to a small canteen at the rear of the rear of a large motor lorry park. We bought some cake and chocolate and ate them on our way home. Nov 2 On 2nd November McCann and I decided to take a trip to Ypres about 5 kilometres away, so we hopped onto the back of a passing motor lorry. No one ever walked around the camps
