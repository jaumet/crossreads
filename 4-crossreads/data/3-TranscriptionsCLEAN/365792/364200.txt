  
 Apl 26 Had a jolly bad night but feeling much better today except for the pain in the eye. Must try & Cable to Mum. Expect to leave for the Aust Base Hosp today. This Hosp is in a beautiful big Church so you can guess the light isn't much good, & the atmosphere is rather depressing. Several of the 9 Batt in here some of them badly wounded. Everybody has treated me excellently so far. Left for Boulogne by special motor, a distance of 60 miles & arrived at the eye Hosp 4 hrs later. The Doc informed me that my left eye is useless so hes taking it out tomorrow morning. [in margin] 13th Stationary Boulogne  Merville Hosp
