21-2-16Mon 21stLast night the mounted patrol of 3 men & Corp. Johns had an adventure probably with a jackal as they could not make out what it was in the dark so, halted it & challenged 3 times & then fired a shot & saw nothing more; This morning while the transport was going over to B Troop one wheel broke through the earth into an old tomb that had been hidden; The Dr & Maj Mills & several lads secured curios out of it such as old coins etc.; Was on duty last night with the patrol out to the North; I sent down 10/- worth of bread to B Troop today , the name of the village they are camped by is Sequela. Had some rare fun boxing  tonight; An Aeroplane flew over us into the desert this afternoon
