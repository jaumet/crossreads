  
 had since Balleul [Bailleul] in February.  I think the division is out now for a good long spell, in fact they say all the Australians are going to have a ninety days spell & quite time too as there would soon be no Australians left if they kept them going like they have been.  The Batts. have all been cut down to three Companies & the Companies to 3 platoons & even now the platoons are very weak. 
 I have a good collection of souvenirs here to send you at the first opportunity.
