<p>11.5.15<br/>the morning.  The day turned rather cool &amp; we had a few drops of rain before dinner, also passed a couple of warships, one I believe is the Majestic &amp; the other only a dummy.  At 4 oclock we came to a camp of Tommies who were banging away with Artillery.  Warships were also firing on guns inland &amp; their fire was directed by two aviators who dropped smoke bombs for the gunners to get the range.  We waited here for an hour &amp; then proceeded along to where the 3rd Bde. landed &amp; anchored for the night.  We were given two days rations of Bully &amp; biscuits &amp; went to sleep in our clothes with all our gear at hand as we expected to land during the night.</p>
