29/8/17 Campagne
A well nourished good looking big man who seems to look just absolutely correct in every way and would probably say just absolutely the correct English thing everytime. After completing the inspection he rode to the saluting base where the Australian flag was flying and took a march past from the three left battalions of the Division. They went up in columns of platoons and returned in columns of route. The mass of moving bayonets was quite impressive. Marched home passing Col. Barney Somerville DAA QMG with some Australian nurses. Formed up on the stubble near A's billets and addressed the men for a few minutes about the parade. They then marched back to their billets and a half holiday and during the afternoon several heavy showers of rain took place.
