<p>from 10-2 AM. when we went to bed &amp; slept till about 8 this morning.  About 1 o'clock we had a feed of steak &amp; onions with coffee &amp; toast, so that we were well able to sleep over our usual breakfast time without noticing it.  We have 2 cases that are rather serious- one chap <strike>gelt</strike>. gets very delirious at night time &amp; is a source of constant worry &amp; anxiety otherwise it is very quiet.  Of course we are off all day, so that it means we are only working 4 hours out of 24.  I went down the lines last night &amp; just by chance saw Robinson (Walters tent mate)  All the tents of the school have been moved again very nearly back on to the same site as they were before.  Robinson told me that they were striking tents first thing on Monday morning &amp; that they were going to the Agric. Ground.  Walter would be staying on at Liverpool but all the rest of his tent mates would be going.  Robinson had all of Walter's kit safe so far, but after Monday he wouldn't be able to look after it as they would be moved.  It was too late then to get a letter out to Walter before Monday so I tried to get him on the phone!  I wasn't able to, though so I tried to 'phone again this morning but was unable to still I sent a telegram to you saying "Tell Walter return Sunday latest, school strikes tents Monday mates go Agricultural Ground, Walter remains Liverpool"<br/>We have very decent N.C.O's over here &amp; I discovered</p>
