  
 bombardment on the night we left the trenches just before we left. I am now a lance Corporal. Received a lot of papers & a couple of letters from home July 22th Behind trenches I have been through our first battle, it was awfull we made an attempt at taking the enemy trenches  but  we got over all right & took two lines of trenches, held them for the night, in the morning the boches opened a furious bombardment, drove back our flanks with bombs in the end we all had to fall back into our own lines. Our losses were very heavy. Our boys fought well & showed a lot of bravery. Received letter from Lou Yesterday. Foray Farm. July  25th 16 We are back once again in our farm, exactly the same quarters as we were before. After the affair of the other night, this place is a treat. To night so far has been very quite, a few machine guns only going. This afternoon we had some shrapnell over, though about a quarter of a mile away. There is one thing we do not like, that is the, stand to, every morning
