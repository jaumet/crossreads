<p>Heard little Flo play the piano &amp; played myself, &amp; enjoyed the evening<br/>Arrived back at 1 AM.<br/>Went over to the School on Sunday afternoon &ndash; stayed till about 8.45 pm<br/>Feel bluey tonight on account of a brush with the enemy, represented by Capt Merrilees &ndash; who is a terribly jumpy individual &amp; says the most ridiculous &amp; pointed things.
