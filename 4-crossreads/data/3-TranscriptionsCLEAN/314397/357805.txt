Just as we got back to Lamotte some Fritz planes started an egg laying competition. Gray & I hid behind a brick wall. It only gave protection from one side tho Seems silly the things one does occasionally. 
 Saturday 10.8.18 Started work on the main road at 1.45pm & knocked off at 8pm. Had tons of work to do as the traffic now is tremendous & old shellholes & new ones all require a lot of filling in. Just before going out Bill Cowper came along to see me. He looks well. Saw the tanks go over, just north of us, also saw the infantry. Gee it looked well. They got all their objectives too.
