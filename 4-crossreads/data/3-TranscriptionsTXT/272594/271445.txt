After a while I went and had a look at their Museum & Art Gallery, their gallery is easily the best in my opinion that I have ever seen, it is something beautiful & the pictures are shown off to perfection  I wandered for nearly 3 hours through the splendid galleries, it is a work of art the inside alone without any of the magnificent pictures to help it along, there are some halls in there which almost make your blood run cold with the pictures
