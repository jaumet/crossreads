<p>Tuesday 16 July 1917 [1918]<br/>Mother's jottings become mixed as night takes the place of day.  Life is dull, share room with S. Henry, 2 V.A.D's, no attempt at privacy &amp; oh the supper at 11.30 p.m.! &amp; the style of one of the Sisters!  All are friendly though S. Moore took over my equipment in G x &amp; so my dear boys &amp; I have parted.<br/>To walk along these big balconies &amp; see long wards of soldiers sleeping, rows of beds on the balconies &amp; even drawn out into the barrack square makes one think a lot.  How many of them dream of home &amp; families I wonder &amp; will they ever leave this hot land, the fearful Jordan Valley?  "The king's soldiers".  I would that big wigs sitting at home in their easy chairs could only see these sights we do in hospital &amp; they would learn what the men put up with.</p>
