tired, when we were brought back again to bayonet drill. This is no light work as there are several trenches to charge, as also several bags hanging on frames, finishing up with a jump across a 4' trench at a bag on the other side. That comes right at the worst part too as one is pretty well done by then.

Thursday 6th. 7th.Cold again. Prospects of more snow. Rain began again. More bayonet work and a bit of marching.
