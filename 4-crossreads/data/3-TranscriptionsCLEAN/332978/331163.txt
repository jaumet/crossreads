84 Nov 6thone is very foolish to settle down because German system is so erratic that one is likely to be shifted with only but a few minutes notice
Nov 7thI like numerous others did not go to bed at all stayed spent most of my time with Leckler & Eva. They all departed at 4 am in a very orderly manner - most of them assembled in Room 30 & when we sang Auld Lang Syne - I feel rather depressed at the departure of the majority of the Fliers. Some were exceedingly nice chaps, whilst others were most undesirable chaps, having no idea of discipline.
a special walk for invalids this afternoon. I went, being pushed by Lodge. It was a very pleasant outing; I had quite a lengthy conversation with two German boys aged 12, very intelligent chaps. I was so taken up with them, I asked for their addresses -
Changed to room 41 with Neame. Recd 3 parcels
November 8thFew officers arrived last evening, all 3 year old Gefangeners - I shifted to Room 28 with Cornish & Hill. Room 31 was too much of a boosers room for me -
