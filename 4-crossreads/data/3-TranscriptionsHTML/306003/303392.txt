<p>14-6-16<br/>Wed 14th<br/>I now live with R.S.M. James &amp; Armorer Sgt. Linsell &amp; am in charge of all Head Quarters during stables &amp; on parades;  Nelson has received 4 days leave to go to Cairo to get fitted up with clothes &amp; kit;  We received orders this evening to be ready to move out at midnight;</p>
<p>15-6-16<br/>Thurs 15th<br/>I had no sleep at all last night as I was busy seeing that all the signalling gear was OK &amp; we had to be saddled ready to file on to the parade ground at 11.30, &amp; as James' batman brought along a drink of tea at 10.30 I was kept going.  no pack horses were allowed to go;<br/>We arrived at Oghratina soon after daybreak &amp; settled down for the day, putting in most of the time looking after the horses &amp;</p>
