<p>Counting votes still   Went to see Sir Geo Reid &amp; gave him Sir Sam McCaughy's letter of introduction &amp; saw over the House of Commons-<br/>Dolly lunches with me each day- Nothing definite as to <u>when</u> a boat sails for Egypt.<br/>Laura is very thin &amp; does not like going up to Walsall she is I think quite satisfied that No 2 is not a success.<br/>English papers regret the Australian vote of NO after all Hughes' talk here.<br/>Don't mention what I say about how the soldiers voted as I am bound to secrecy.</p>
