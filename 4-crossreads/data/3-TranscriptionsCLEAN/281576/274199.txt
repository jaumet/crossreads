 Fri. Mar. 30th  Went into Albert with Billy Williams & had a good look round the Town.  Quite a number of civilians have returned & the place is looking quite civilised.  Got Letter from Ruth B. 
 Sat. Mar. 31  Some H.Q. Staff has moved into Albert & the Town is full of Red Caps.  One has to be careful about saluting these days.
