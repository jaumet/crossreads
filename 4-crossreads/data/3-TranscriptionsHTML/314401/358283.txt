<p>stem to stem; we throw open the scuttles &amp; we breathe heavens pure air throughout the night  <u>17/8/14</u>  I came on watch this morning at 4 o'clock. At five minutes to six the sky was still dark with fringes of grey. At 6 o'clock the sun was leaping up into the sky &amp; at the same moment our own propellers begin to revolve and we start to move our way between these terrible coral reefs into the open sea. We are off on another long journey, this time to Noumea in New Caledonia which is French territory. There we shall rendezvous with the   <strike>the</strike> ships from the New Zealand Station, the Psyche and Pyramus, who are convoying troops. We shall lay in a couple of thousands of Westport coal &amp; go off again for another 1500 mile trip to Samoa (German). Rumour has it that we shall bombard that place which on surrendering, will be garrisoned by the troops we are convoying. We expect to get to Samoa on Wed the 26th. Then something may happen. We are travelling on &amp; on without anything to break the monotony. We seem to have forgotten the Germans who, I expect, are only too glad to be out of our way, poor devils. War does seem a horrible absurdity these days. Fancy being led to war by such nice, courteous, harmless country gentlemen like Sir George Patay, Captain Glossop, Captain Silvre all of whom wd. I am sure be very much more at home tending flowers or playing bowls. Not that they won't fight for they will &amp; no mistake, when the time comes, but I am sure the other wd. please them far more. Gone gone for ever is the old Berserker  madness which made war look virtuous. It is an excess of coolness that is demanded now; a temper that can look on the bursting of a shell at close quarters with studied indifference. In the old days, every man wd. fight &amp; gain what satisfaction he might from the exercise of his blood lust. Now it is only a small proportion of men in this ship who will do the actual fighting; the great majority say 700 will be dancing attendance on machinery as if nothing untoward was going on or running errands or getting their first aid appliances ready. 22/8/14 These intervening days I have been writing other letters to post to you &amp; the children. There has been nothing going on and I may not write a real love letter &ndash; yet. I was on watch</p>
