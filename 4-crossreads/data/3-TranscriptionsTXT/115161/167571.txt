 of our Motherland.&nbsp; 
 Codford is or was (before it was despoiled by soldiers) just such a village as portrayed above. 
 It was a very large camp at (or near) Codford.. A canteen, wet and dry. Hot and&nbsp;cold baths. Everything had been done for the comfort and cleanliness of the troops. 
 We went in for solid training here. Route marches, physical jerks, drill, skirmishing, bayonet exercise, rifle practise, bomb-throwing, in fact everything that could possibly be required was taught us here, by competent instructors. 
 The first day after our arrival, we were inoculated, just over the heart, and so severe was the operation, that we were compelled to rest for a considerable time. We thought that they may have waited a day or two, to let us get over the voyage. 
 The weather was bitterly cold, and it played up with us a good deal, but as we had to settle down to solid work, little time was given to pay much attention to the elements. 
 Our parade ground was situated on a hill adjoining the camp. How we loathed the sight of that hill. The approach was up a steep road of white clay, and you can perhaps imagine the state of our boots and clothes were in by the end of the day. You ask any fellow who was in the camp if he remembers that hill, and see the look on his face, but don&#39;t ask him his opinion of it, it might shock you. 
 Our duties were varied from time to time. Guard was a duty we all tried to dodge, walking up and down in the cold and wet night and day, did not appeal to us. Fatigue work comprised among other things unloading trucks of coal, or road-making material or anything else required by the military. 
 We were allowed to visit the surrounding villages during the evenings, after first obtaining a &quot;pass&quot; from the orderly room.
