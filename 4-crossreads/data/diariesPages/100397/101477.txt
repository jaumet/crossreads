Regarding Conscription. I dont think that any more than 5 voted yess, if there were that many. We are only about five minutes walk from Wareham, it is a quaint old place none of the streets are straight, they are narrow and crooked and the buildings are nearly all old. There are one or two fairly modern places the old Roman earthworks are still round the town. I have not been able to see much of it so far as we are not allowed to go in before four P.M. and then it is soon dark at night  it is quite dark in the streets, as the place is not lighted at all, why I do not know. other places of far more importance are well lighted up. this morning we were marched down to the Church a very fine old building with large stained Windows. The walls inside are covered with "In Memoriam Tablets." There is one Church there 1250 years old, but I do not know any of its history. Later ? We went out to see the Ruins of Corfe Castle on Sunday afternoon, it stands about four miles from here on the line to Swanage we had the walk out but came back by train. The Castle is or was one of the oldest in England and was used to Imprison all prisoners of any importance in and it is said that once they entered the Prison Gate they gave up all hope of ever seeing the outer world again. I am sending a few P.C's showing various parts of the old ruin
