<p>that he would take considerably shifting out of this specially</p>
<p>as immediately behind it was Loupart Wood an excellent artillery</p>
<p>position and one from which he commanded a considerable field of</p>
<p>fire.&nbsp; My Battalion was taken out of the line to a spot a couple</p>
<p>of miles in rear where two old trenches and the remnants of a</p>
<p>Wood were found, they whole as nearly as possible&nbsp; resembling the</p>
<p>two lines of trenches at Grevillers and Loupart Wood.&nbsp; On these</p>
<p>we practised the attack for four days and then returned to the line to try it on Fritz.&nbsp; The night we got back to the Line,</p>
<p>however, Fritz cleared out so we had a bloodless victory and</p>
<p>morning saw us strolling about in Loupart Wood examining his old</p>
<p>gun positions of which there were a great number - likewise heaps</p>
<p>of empty bottles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night we pushed his rearguard out of the</p>
<p>village of Grevillers and dug ourselves in on the far side of the</p>
<p>village.&nbsp; When morning broke we got our first glimpse of</p>
<p>Bapaume, the town which since the Australians advent into the</p>
<p>Somme Battle at Pozieres had always remained in our minds as our</p>
<p>ultimate objective.&nbsp; And shortly we were to have it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the two days we were entrenched at Grevillers</p>
<p>the Germans bombarded the village continuously until not a building</p>
<p>was left whole.&nbsp; As usual the Church came in for most attention</p>
<p>and even after it had been reduced to a heap of broken bricks he</p>
<p>still poured shells into it in great numbers..&nbsp; Our trench was</p>
<p>only about 50 yards from this Church but fortunately his shooting</p>
<p>was excellent and every shot fell plunk into that heap of bricks and none worried us.&nbsp; As a matter of fact I don&#39;t think he knew</p>
<p>we were there for quite a time because he was most careless about</p>
<p>exposing himself and we got some excellent rifle shooting at about</p>
