<p>to mention that in our advance along the road from Asby to Beersheeba our force cut off 1300 Turks who attempted to blow up the road at different points, this enemy force was later on surrounded &amp; captured by our Camel Corps.&nbsp; The bombardment on the Gaza positions and at other points of the line during the past couple of days has been tremendous.&nbsp; Though we are 30 miles off we can hear the guns thundering heavily all day &amp; night.</p>
<p><u>Nov 1st</u>:&nbsp; Moved camp out about 1 mile from Beersheeba</p>
