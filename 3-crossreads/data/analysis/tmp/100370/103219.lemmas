 of this old place . This is a twelfth centuri build also , erect by the nativ Christian on the ruin of an old Roman fort . The road we travel when we final got a start on with the transport was rough in the extrem . It knock our hors about terribl . We took the road which branch off from the main Jaffa to Jerusalem road , just abov the villag of Sari and immedi befor come into sight of El Enab , which lie just round the bend . Almost immedi after start we halt to allow the transport to straighten itself out , and could see it scrambl wend away up the rocki hill in front , the hors scrambl and stumbl among the loos stone , and strain at the trace . Just here on our left , is a compar new build , with what is a most rare sight here , a galvan iron roof . What it is I do not know . It was quit an hour befor all the transport in front had move and we began the ascent up toward Nebi Samwil , the highest mountain in this part of the Countri . The journey was a seri of halt . The limber most of them overload , had their burden shaken off at frequent interv , and the road be so narrow , each time this occur , the whole of the transport would have to wait . This occur sever time with us , and then , go down one big hill , our brake broke , so find a place where we could turn to the side of the road , we pull our team over , unload , and then reload afresh . By this time the Artilleri transport had possess of the road , and we could not have got onto it had we tri without break their column , so we fed up , boil the billi and had dinner ourselv of Maconochi . This is an excel ration of meat and veget , and far superior to , and more liber than bulli beef . There must be go to be a great stunt up in these hill this time . For an hour and more a seem endless stream of big gun and gun limber pass us , the biggest display of artilleri I have seen here
