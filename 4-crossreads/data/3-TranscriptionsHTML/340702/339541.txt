<p>I believe I have a chance of getting Paris leave shortly. I shall have to put in some overtime on my French.  28-2 Letter to Harry</p>
<p>1.3.18  The lack of organization at this dump is pitiable. The Works officer [shorthand] is nearly always drunk and dopey when he is sober. [shorthand] much better. Fritz planes over in force last night. Tommy [shorthand] windy. Heavy Frost today. Slight Sleet.</p>
<p>Saturday 2.3.18   Very Cold &amp; Windy. Ive just been listening to some first hand information about the Boer War. When Colonel Mahon releived Mafeking his men marched by night in the valleys so as to avoid attracting attention still that does'nt altogether account for the fact that his men marched into the town unobserved &amp; actually had to awaken the Garrison, who seemed to be well provisioned too. After these men (Mahons) crowd left Mafeking. They were recalled by Helio to extricate Baden-Powell who had been bottled up again by the Boers in a pass. So much for our cheif Scout. At the relief of Rustenberg the relieving column found tons of provisions of every kind in the town. The relieving column were in bad straits for tucker themselves, &amp; the ungrateful relievees made a deal of fuss about selling my Informant &frac12; doz. loaves of Bread for the relieving Officer &amp; Staff. The relieving officer was so disgusted when he seen how things really were that he marched his men straight out again</p>
