Wednesday 20-12-16Wood fatigue today.  Watery blink of Sunshine.  Snow & freezing hard.  We have made arrangements for a case of whiskey.  I am wondering how it will work.  Fritz took advantage of the fine day to Shell the camp with heavy stuff.  I seen him send 3 Huts up in the air.  There must have been a number of casualties.
Thursday 21-12-16We got a case of Whiskey this night & for the first time (I hope) in my life I got Drunk very Drunk.  I went down as quickly as if I was pole axed & made a very sorry exhibition of myself.
Friday 22-12-16Very sick today.  Seen the Dr did'nt work at all.  Felt Horrible.
Saturday 23-12-16Heard today that Bob has been killed on the 2-11-16.  The coming Xmas promised dismal enough with out this to make it worse.  He is Buried in Bernafay wood Cemetary & alongside of him lies L.C. Wailes  Engs. late of Burwood. Sub...  a mistake.
