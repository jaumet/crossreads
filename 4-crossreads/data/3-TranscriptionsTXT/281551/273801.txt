 June Bight. 
 On the evening of the 17th of June we reached Adelaide and anchored just off from the entrance to the outer harbour.  It is 10 o'clock at night and is too late to go inside.  The harbour is too small for a boat as big as the Leicestershire to go in and turn about in the dark. 
 June the 18th 1919 This morning at about seven o'clock we weighed anchor &amp; entered the Outer harbour where we were soon moored to the wharf &amp; the disembarkation of the South Australians soon commenced, by 11 o'clock every South Australian was off the boat.
