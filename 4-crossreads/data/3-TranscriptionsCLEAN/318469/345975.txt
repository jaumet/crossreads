Had a little rain on the trip over.  Pitched tents late in afternoon all feeling very tired.  Very large number war craft in Harbor - also many large transports -  travelled over in "Snaefel"
16thDid very little today - just resting and making ourselves comfortable.  Large number troops arrived from Anzac & there is no doubt that there is to be a general evacuation of the position.  Rumoured we are to go to Egypt.
17thThings quiet.  A good many troops coming in from Anzac.  Did a little Drill this morning & a little fatigue.  Beautiful weather.
18thTook up our quarters with the rest of the Coy today.  Sections reallotted.  2nd Cpl Banks & I are the only two of the old boys to remain in No 1 Sec.  Troops still coming in from Anzac.  So far the movement of evacuation has been entirely successful.
19thWorking on fatigue this morning building insinerator.  Troops still coming in from Anzac.  Movement still successful.  Cloudy & cool.
20thAs far as we can gather the Troops are about all off Anzac.  The movement was completely successful there being practically no casualties.  The movement has been wonderfully successful.  Drilling this morning, nothing fresh.
21stThings going quietly.  Very heavy rain this morning.  Cpt. Biden of "Duntroon" & one of our late Coy Sec. officers died in hospital this morning at about 2 a.m.  We attended funeral in the afternoon
22ndThings going as usual - nothing of importance.  Coy doing a little Drill & fatigues.  Weather overcast & cloudy & cool.  Was out on the harbour this afternoon & visited "Carrigan Head" & other boats for purpose of obtaining stores
23rdGot orders early this morning to pack up & be ready to go aboard by 12 noon.  Was taken to the "Caledonia" in the "Alls Well" a mine layer & got aboard about 2 p.m.  "Caledonia" is a fine boat of the "Anchor" line.  We have good sleeping berths.  Do not know where we are going - but think to Alexandria.  Expect to leave tomorrow morning.  Weather squally.
24thLeft "Mudros Harbour" about 10 a.m.  Apparently steering at straight course for Alexandria & running about 15 knots per hour.  Weather squally & sea rather choppy with a fair swell.  Got through day safely although enemy precaution is being taken against submarine attack as there are supposed to be about 30 enemy submarines in these & Mediterranean waters.  All hands are wearing life belts night & day.
25thA nice fine day - had Xmas on the water.  Nothing of importance happened - have escaped from enemy's submarine craft so far.
26thWhen we got out of bed this morning Alexandria was within sight & we anchored in the stream at about 8 a.m.  Laid in Harbor all day.  Beautiful fine day.  Had good passage across.  Expect to leave for Cairo in the morning early.
27thLeft Alexandria today at about 10 p.m.  1st 2nd & 3rd Coys all travelled
