Thursday 28th March 1917 [28th February 1918]Bright sunny day after all the wind & storms of the last week.  Lovely tinted sunrises & sunsets.  Storms today among the English sisters re a S. Reid who quarrels wherever she goes - I am only glad have not yet met her.Sisters come "on the strength" for a week or so & then drift away up the line or exchange places with others at different hospitals.
