<p>had a real good time, as they could smoke while being lectured. This was more in their line just then.</p>
<p>Good weather prevailed till Suez our destination was reached.</p>
<p>After waiting a couple of days here, for orders, during which we managed to get away a mail to Australia by the RMS Osterley we proceed through the Canal to Port Said. As we entered we received a very warm welcome from civilians &amp; soldiers alike &amp; this continued at every Camp along the Canal till darkness blotted out everything but our bright (Electric) Head light.</p>
<p>While at Suez we saw two "troopers" loaded with Russians proceeding to France. As the vessels were anchored very close together the Russians entertained us, all one afternoon by clearing a space on the after deck of their vessels and going through their National Dances. One man would give one style another a different one &amp; so on till evidently they had exhausted their full list.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they did not appear to understand English, &ndash; or Australian. Their efforts to Coo-ee &amp; even to cheer were rather amusing, but they all seemed very elated &amp; jolly.</p>
<p>On arrival at Port Said we gave an impromptu Concert to the evident delight of a number of the White population. Although it was started with about half a dozen men, it proved one of the best Concerts given. At Port Said we got our first sight of several huge French battleships &amp; quite a number of British &amp; French Cruisers &amp; Gunboats. We intended proceeding to Alexandria by the Troop ship but as a P &amp; O Steamer had been sunk not far from Port Said some days before, we waited for further instructions although the steamer was fitted there with a 4.7 Gun.</p>
<p>While at Port Said although unable to leave the vessel</p>
