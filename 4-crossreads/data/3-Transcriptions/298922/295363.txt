<p><u>Personal</u><br/>[This page crossed through]<br/>"Sitting" on a <u>Board</u> on a horse that was killed. After hearing the evidence &amp; visiting the Body &ndash; The Board <strike>having viewed the Body</strike> found that the Horse was dead!! etc. etc. thro' anti aircraft gun no blame being attached to anyone!!! etc. etc. Since my wedding has appeared in the Papers find I get much fewer letters &amp; fewer PARCELS, still the wife makes up for all that. Re U.S.A. we had an order to recall all American [indecipherable] some time ago - the reason was that some Yankee bombs had been filled with sawdust, of course this may be a libel.</p>
