<p>where we now rest has taken us through what I think is the most spectacular country in all that part of the World that I have travelled in.

Both Rogers &amp; myself have managed to cook, <u>serve</u>, and wash up without losing any of the sights as seen from our truck.  I can safely cut up the description of the scenery into five departments.
