<p>MarlyBone station at 3.30 pm  23 minutes late after a fairly fast journey  beautiful train overcrowded.  we had to wait until 4.45 on account of missing the 3.7 train for Harefield from the same station  walk about the town.  we got train which did not go direct to Hairfield.  Same to <strike>Bush</strike> Ruislip change there for Harefield.  it was rotten to have to change so much  when we got there we had to wait until the motors came which came at 7 oclock.  we arrived at Harefield 5.13 18 mile.  went through the usual [indecipherable] inspection by doc  placed into wards &amp; then some tucker as we had not had any since 6 oclock same morn.</p>
