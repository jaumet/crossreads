<p>A.J.'s farewell</p>
<p>And so you're off to Palestine!<br/>Let's drink a cup for auld lang syne &ndash;<br/>Gin is the surest anodyne<br/>For every woe.<br/>I hope the weather will be fine &ndash;<br/>It looks like snow.<br/>Sailing's the devil when it's snowing<br/>And more than half a gale is blowing,<br/>For you can't see which way you're going<br/>Or what's ahead;</p>
<p>And any moment &ndash; there's no knowing &ndash;<br/>You may be dead!<br/>This is not quite the time of year<br/>That one would choose to volunteer<br/>For foreign service.  It's d-d queer<br/>And mighty risky &ndash;<br/>U boats are always in or near<br/>That Bay of Biscary.</p>
