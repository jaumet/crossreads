1916   MONDAY 4   SEPT.
Fine, but came onto rain in evening. Out with the signallers all day, but it was too wet for a lamp parade at night. All the boys came back from Winchester at dinner time. They learnt nothing down there. In fact I think we learnt more here. Anyway I hope we settle down & learn something now. Posted my ["?"] & letters to Linda & Father & Jo.
