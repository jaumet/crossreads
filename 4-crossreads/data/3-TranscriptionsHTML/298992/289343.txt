<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>I guess this will be a surprise for you &ndash; but it is just as big a surprise to me. I never thought when I left Australia I would be back so soon. I hope you have not been worrying too much at not having heard from me for so long, because I am O.K.  I hope to be home to see you before long. But to begin at the beginning.</p>
<p>I think last time I wrote I was in the Hospital at Heliopolis. I told you I had influenza but I had worse than that. I had been in Hospital about a week &amp; had pretty well recovered from my cold, when I got very feverish and malaria broke out. I had a pretty rotten time for a week or two, but got over it alright as you can see.</p>
<p>Altogether I was 5 weeks in the Hospital and when I came out I was pretty weak &amp; thin. Of course I was not made to drill or do any work and just loafed about convalescing. I had only been out a few days, when one afternoon an Officer came up &amp; told me I was going to Australia the next</p>
