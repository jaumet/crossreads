There is a rather chap in No 1 Command by name of "Bomber Ball". It appears that during the fighting at Bullecourt last May, his party captured a number of Germans, among them a Major. This Major stood on his ?dig? and said he would not go back to the cage without an escort of an officer of equal rank. "Bomber" quite equal to the occasion said "Right O, you are reduced to the Ranks by Bomber Ball "Quick March".
