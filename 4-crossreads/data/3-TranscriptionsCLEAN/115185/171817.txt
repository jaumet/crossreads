2 - take to Grandmother - where we went after having supper in an express [indecipherable] I heard Rosamond sing for the first time since I arrived. Her voice has developed wonderfully. Jocelyn wouldn't sing except with the others at my request. That sweet hymn you sang with them of Rossetti's. I had a talk with Grandmother she always seems to have visitors - holds a sort of levee, so when I go there I generally have to wait to see her, and then leave to let someone else talk to her. She is very sweet and interested in all people and bright and has no pain. Talks of you as my sweet lovely darling, as yu usual.
