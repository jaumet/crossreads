 December  1918. Monday 9 
 Wembley and Birmingham Weather wet. Ran up to Brum early morning train. Came back and received a pair of wires, one granting extension the other from Roy, another example of silly sarcasm. Had a letter from P.G. written from B-  I'm very sorry to receive the news . Spent a few happy hours with O. during the evening. Ran down to Harrow for an hour or so bought some presents for Roy's wife.
