<p>the summer sun was setting in a bed of purple &amp; golden clouds &amp; the reflections it threw on the water were lovely &amp; the fishing boats were all out with full sails up &amp; they looked like huge while birds sitting on the water.</p>
<p>To my left is the pretty little town of Paris Plage with 2 great lighthouses standing boldly out like sentinels of the deep, their snowy white appearance showing splendidly against the hills of green trees at their back.   On my right is nothing but the coast of France (very sandy at this part) &amp; the wide wide ocean, behind me are the hills</p>
