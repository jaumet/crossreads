 went to a position called "The Bund." Releived the Royal Irish Rifles. I have a good shelter here. There is a branch of the Y.M.C.A, near; the first one I have ever seen in a dugout. September 2nd 1916. Moved up nearer the line yesterday from here we will do carring fatigue for Engineers, Rations, etc. I have a good shelter, with bunks, etc. that some wag has named "Rat Villa". The rats are very troublesome at night; for they crawl all over one; and fight on the floor. I'll back them to eat a hole through any thing; and some of them are an enormous size. There are some Canadians working near; they are characters. Some of their expressions are too droll for words. Fritz snipes at us with "77" guns here.
