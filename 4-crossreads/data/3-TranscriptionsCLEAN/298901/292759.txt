Monday 29th JulyThe barrage opened up at 12.30 A.M. but not a heavy one.  The stunt itself was small, on a 4000 yd front & was an advance of 500 yds.

We used lorries & cars for the evacuating.  One Fritz officer was a perfect specimen of a man & some of the Americans, who enjoyed themselves hugely, were very useful as interpreters
