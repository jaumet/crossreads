  
 Wednesday 20th March Four of our men went out this morning to put the finishing touches to the job. I had to make the concrete inside look pretty by sticking mud in any little cracks & holes reminded me of my childhood makeing mud pies & just about as usefull. The Major came along. He did not like the job some of it badley done & to a certain extent he is right. Several nights while we were working the concrete would freese while hung mixed & putting in reinforcements in the dark is no easy matter but even allowing for that some of the work could have been better. This M.G. Post was a half circular construction butting on to an old Hun Pill box. It is about 6' high inside & the same in diameter with walls about 2' thick & roof 4' thick solid concrete. We have had to make most of our own frames out of any thing we could find so that naturally the inside is rough
