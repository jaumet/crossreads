<p>about it a lot lately, that my path of duty may be shown me clearly; I have decided that it would be foolish of me to do anything about it yet until my leg is thoroughly healed &amp; my blood in a satisfactory state.  When I have come to this stage, my decision will depend on how matters are going.  As to the A.M.P. Policy, I am pretty well decided to let this drop- in fact I shouldn't have taken it on in the first place. <u> If I go</u> to the war, I will have to pay &amp;pound10-6-0 which includes premiums &amp; fine <u>plus</u> a War Premium of &amp;pound5 per cent which on my policy would be &amp;pound10 or a total of &amp;pound20-6-0.  The policy is not good enough for that, for if I was to get a bullet in my head soon after I started what would be the good of the policy to me then.  I have absolutely no debts at all up here, &amp; provided I left Australia owing no money that's all thats wanted.<br/><u>If I don't</u> go to the war; the policy is useless until I should become engaged to be married.  If I couldn't get a 1st class policy, my health wouldn't warrant getting married, &amp; if I couldn't keep a policy paid up then, I couldn't keep a wife.  No, Father dear, I think I will let it go before I pay any more on it, &amp; then if ever I became engaged I propose to take out a combined life &amp; accident policy.<br/>Must close now with love to all at home<br/>Your loving son,  Leo.</p>
