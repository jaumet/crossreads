  
 had all got home. The wretches! I have just finished reading a book called "A wife out of Egypt" and was jolly interested it as it is all about the places I have seen here, and also has a lot of the feelings in it about Cairo that I have felt, though I suppose most people would say it was rather bitter - but I agree with it that, although individual English people are alright; as a class in Cairo they are rotters. After all said and done I have been writing up a few things about our Assuan stunt to send along with the photos. It may be some time before I get home with the guide book, and I know you are interested in anything I am interested in! The thing that annoys me about writing one of those "young books" about any place is that when you thinks of Sam Wellers remark "She'll wish there was more, and that's the great art of letter writing" you see what complete failures they are. of course Sam had never been to Luxor or Assuan; so perhaps he was not qualified to judge, but I'm afraid letter writing is an art I unfortunately dont possess. Latest rumour has it the 1st Bde is going early in March so we still may be home soon! I'll send you a cable when I'm leaving if possible. 
 Love to Father, Hal & Fred & yourself. 
 I am Your loving son Rob
