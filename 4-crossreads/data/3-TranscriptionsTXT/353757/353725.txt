 Dear Vol 
 Just a note in pr&eacute;cis;  waiting here for a ship home and expect to be home soon after this letter.  Got my com. after all.  Anxious to get back and also get a job.  What's the prospect of the latter?  Mrs. Hine told me you wrote her, hope you have met her ere now.  Brother George hasn't written lately;  owes me a letter.  Suppose he's too busy marching Rhinewards.  Suppose you'll not come away now;  good job, too.  Stay there if possible.  Influenza still bad here.  Hope it doesn't get too bad in Aussie. 
 Cheerio, hope to see you ere you have time to acknowledge this letter. 
 Your cobber Arthur Hine 2nd Lt.
