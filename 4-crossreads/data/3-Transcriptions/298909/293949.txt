<p>over &amp; over again at not being paid, we were told could get it today &amp; were disappointed &ndash; the whole of A &amp; B Details &ndash; Artillery. A.S.C etc  are growling at no leave &ndash; no pay &ndash; bad tucker &amp; short rations &ndash; about 9 pm they wrecked the wet Canteen &amp; helped themselves to Tobacco &amp; shicker. Chaos reigned supreme &ndash; Officers were useless &ndash; at last a strong guard were called out &amp; kept the Boys in order &ndash; several free fights etc. The Officers got some plain talk, such as why the A.B.C. don't you give us some pay &ndash; tucker or leave.</p>
