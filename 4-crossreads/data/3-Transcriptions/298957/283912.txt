<p>13th Jan (Thursday) On guard all day &amp; reading.</p>
<p>14th Jan (Friday) Route march along railway line in morning. Short lecture in afternoon. At 7 pm we had to go out in the dark for practise at carrying and finding wounded. Rather a stupid adventure. I helped to carry two 12 stone men over a long distance and was pretty well knocked out after it, so were the others.</p>
<p>15th Jan (Saturday) Beautiful day. Stretcher drill and lecture on Morphia Inoculations. Afternoon off</p>
<p>16th Jan (Sunday) A memorable</p>
