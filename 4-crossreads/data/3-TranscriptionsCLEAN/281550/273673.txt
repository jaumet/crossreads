 On Sundays and holidays when we are not working, we are all locked up in the barrack, and not allowed to roam about the factory like we used to do. 
 The trouble was caused through two Russians escaping. 
 At meal times we have a ticket for our soup, which we have to hand in to be checked every day. We also have to take a ticket to work with us in the mornings, and give it in as we return to the barrack at night. 
 The idea of these tickets is that if we escape, they will discover the fact in the afternoon when we all are finished work and return to the barrack, And so be able to send search parties out. And also warn the Police & civillians, before we have a chance of getting many miles away.
