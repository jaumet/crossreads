I must mention here that there is on the ship, an Inhaling Room.  Parades are made to this room at frequent intervals during the voyage for the purpose of fumigation.  About 50 men enter at a time, and by means of a steam pipe or tube, emitting steam at a point conjointly with another tube containing Zinc Sulphate disinfectant, it sends into the atmosphere of the room a steamy vapour which is inhaled, and becomes a destroyer of any germs that might be lurking round.  This is necessary on board a troopship where a number of men are grouped so closely together for say a couple of months at the least.  Next to this room is the Isolation Hospital, but of course no access is obtainable to it from any part of the ship except by the steps leading up to the one and only door, and at the foot of the steps a Guard is posted.</p><p>Before I proceed further with this narrative, I would like to dwell just a moment on the subject of bird life at sea, and other items of passing interest, which may be just a little off the point, but worthy of note.</p><p>Before the ship is many days on its journey across the Ocean, the sea birds make their appearence.  The most noticeable is the Albatross (reminding one of \"The Ancient Mariner\") which I might say is almost a constant companion, especially when in mid ocean.  This bird flies around the ship day after day, in search of food of any description that may be thrown over the side.  If it were not for his presence, life on the sea for the troops would be void of much interest, as a transport generally keeps well away from the ordinary trade route, thereby minimising any chance of seeing a passing sail.</p>","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p class=\"page\" id=\"a5676004\">[Page 4]</p>\n<p>After dinner the Mess Orderlies are again busy, while the men lounge about, or play quoits, cards, or other games, until \"Fall in\" at 2 p.m. calls them again to duty.
