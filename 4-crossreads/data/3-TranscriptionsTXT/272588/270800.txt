 Tuesday 12 November At Bazeul on the le Cateau-Maubeuge Road. We are moving to-morrow, moving back &amp; rumours are rife that we are en route for Marseilles &amp; thence to Turkey. 
 Wednesday 13 November Early this morning we moved, back to Busigny, a march of nine miles or so.  En route, we passed 4th Army H.Q. &amp; while passing General Rawlinson came and had a few words with us.  He told us that we were going to Busigny area until the railway was repaired to Germany &amp; then we were to go on to Coblenz, on the Rhine!!! What joyous news. New lands to discover &amp; new people to see. Of course, yesterday's rumours dispelled..
