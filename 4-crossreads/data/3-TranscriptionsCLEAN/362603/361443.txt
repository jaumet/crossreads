5.  night, things were very awkward.  We were just delighted to hear that George had got a rise in the world & also an outdoor job.  It will be hard for us to stick at an indoor job when we go back.  We are in & out of doors all day & get plenty of fresh air.  I had a letter & Photo from Amy Cocks who is secretary of the Ladies swimming Club this mail.  She is a nice girl & one of my first Manly Pals.  Fanny Durack is no doubt a wonderful Swimmer.  Did You notice Isme Amor & Mip Fevye swimming.  By Jingo fancy lying under the Guava Tree.  While it was not a foot high when we left.  We'll hardly know the place when we come back.  I sincerely Hope that Mr Keirle
