<p>The Ceramic left Devonport for London to discharge her cargo of wheat which she brought from Australia at 7 o'clock pm.</p>
<p>END OF PART 1</p>
<p>P.S.S. <br/>The trip over on board the Troopship Ceramic, was, on the whole, very pleasant, My Reinforcement was allotted the best position on the boat for comfort &amp; easy travelling, Our quarters was the old Second Class dining Saloon &amp; it was situated right amidships.'</p>
<p>We slept on hammocks which were slung to the ceiling at night above the tables, And at day time they were taken down &amp; rolled up neatly &amp; placed in the crates provided for the purpose &amp; are thereby kept out of the way.</p>
<p>I was on the water for 45 days altogether &amp; was not sick during the voyage. The Ceramic is a very good sea boat in rough weather.</p>
