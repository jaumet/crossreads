<p>we can't see far into No Man's land. My turn on observation &amp; gas guard from 5 to 6 a.m.. after which I had just turned into my comfy little dugout, &amp; was nicely asleep when the order "Stand to" came along &amp; all the sleepers had to turn out, much to their disgust. As not a gun could be heard, we were hoping old Sol would disperse the fog, &amp; make the light brighter so as they'd let us go back to "bed". It was certainly a good morning for a silent raid, the message said Fritz showed signs of massing on the left, but evidently someone had the "windup", as after standing wearily for two hours, "stand down" came along, &amp; all but the look-out man turned in. Slept till 2 p.m. when old Mitchell &amp; I had our customary snack &amp; hot drink. Our 'planes were conspicuous by their absence this evening, &amp; Fritz had a lot flying about, got quite cocky &amp; when our Lewis guns opened out on one 'plane flying above us, he returned fire from his machine gun, &amp; made us get under the parapet. Later on, when our 'planes appeared, he kept away behind his own lines. We sat down &amp; had the usual "chat" hunt in shirts &amp; pants, &amp; it proved successful, of course. Nice sunny day, but it came up cloudy &amp; rainy looking again at night . On fatigue again deepening &amp; widening the front line trench.</p>
