We have been very busy again today packing up ready to move off again tonight. I got my permanent horse this morning. Not a bad mount by any means. We have been equipped with everything new. We loaded our Battery on to the train 7 minutes under record time and left Harve about 6.30 pm We were all very sorry to lose Mr Wilson from the Battery. He was the only one who attended to our comfort. He has been sent into the trench mortar

I was unlucky enough to get into the only 3rd class carriage on the train the others being 1st and 2nd. Very stiff this morning Passed through Rouen last night and Calais and St. Omer this morning. Got to our destination at Steenling about 5 p.m. and went on with our guns about 5 miles to a place near Bleninghem. We got billeted in subsections in farmhouses. I am in a loft in a stable and slept very comfortably on straw.

July 3
We are only about 12 miles behind the firing line here and are going into action any day now. We could see a couple of aeroplanes over our lines this afternoon being shelled but nothing resulted We have most of our time cut out attending the horses. Mine has ringworms and greasy heals. Every farm house seems to be a tavern in this country. Plenty of wine & beer

July 4
There is a tremendous lot of dissatisfaction in the Battery and quite a number are getting transfers into a trench mortar battery. We are to move off tomorrow into the firing line to relieve the 2nd Division . on buzzer work this morning. The left Section is playing the Right Section football today. I am suffering a good deal from piles lately bleeding internally
