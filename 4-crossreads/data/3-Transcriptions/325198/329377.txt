<p>1 Oct, 1916<br/>Romani<br/>This morning we had to turn out of nice comfortable blankets at day light &amp; pull down the tents &ndash; Its a good joke following in the tracks of the 1st Bdg and cleaning up their camps for them.  In an hour there was a great change in the look of the place, where the tents had been were bivvies of all sorts &amp; descriptions, the boys are some class at rigging shelters now.  This afternoon we had to parade in front of General Chauvel who gave us a lecture &amp; presented a DCM to a chap in the 7th.  Perce just came along &amp; warned me for Gaurd, not a bad job considering we move off in the morning &ndash; I received a pretty decent lot of mail last night there was a letter from Bert dated 10 Sept so hes going pretty OK as yet</p>
