<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I received your letter containing your cards of introduction and I wish to thank you very sincerely for your kindness &amp; for the trouble you have taken on my behalf.</p>
<p>I met Keith shortly after I arrived at Rollestone camp in the middle of November and of course we were delighted.  He was looking very fit &amp; seemed to have grown considerably since I last him.  He was then at the Officers Training School at Tidworth to which I also went the next week.  We were together there for a fortnight; after that Keith returned to Rollestone and expected to go across to France in the next few days.  The weather is fairly cold &amp; snow has already fallen, which was a novel spectacle to me, as I have never seen before.</p>
<p>Hoping yourself &amp; family are all in the best of health I remain yours sincerely<br/>Allan.</p>
