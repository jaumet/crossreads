<p>all our gear on &amp; prepare to move forward. We had to move on another 800 yards to where the 16th B'n should have gone the first day, but owing to opposition &amp; their own supporting tanks being knocked out, they couldn't get there. We started off tired &amp; hungry, &amp; were told the rations would come on behind us, &amp; we'd get them in the new trench. I didn't care about this night adventure in unknown country in darkness, &amp; with no artillery support, but they counted on a peaceful penetration, &amp; that Fritz had gone further back.<br/>Saty 10 Aug <br/>We went further along an old sap in single file for some distance, &amp; then along a road, then turned into another trench, came out &amp; sat beside a sunken road for some time, awaiting the eternal orders. Finally we moved on, &amp; hadn't gone far, when some said "Look out, Fritz is here." We lay down quickly, were near an old trench, which some got in, &amp; we peered into the grass looking for the Huns. Then of his murderous machine guns began spitting out fire, &amp; we were properly held up, to move on would have meant death against those machine guns hidden in the long grass in the darkness looking for the Huns. Then two of his murderous machine guns began spitting out fire, &amp; we were properly held up, to move on would have meant death against those machine guns hidden in the long grass in the darkness. Lt. Player called out for Cpl. Stewart &amp; his Lewis gun, &amp; Paddy Stewart fired his Lewis gun into the direction the Hun was firing from. Then I was put in a sap with another chap to guard against anyone coming along it. It was a ticklish job, as when I looked along the next corner it was almost impossible to see whether any Boches were there or not. Anyway I was feeling far more like a sleep or some thing to eat, than boxing on with the Hun. I kept sneaking on from corner to corner, &amp; at last came to a dead end, &amp; found the sap is not occupied</p>
