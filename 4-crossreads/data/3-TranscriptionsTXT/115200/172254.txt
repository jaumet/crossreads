I am on Board the Hospital Ship Soudan and we are Bound for Malta wich we Expect to reach on Saturday Some time  At present the Sea is Splendid but we may run into Heavey weather before we reach port. We came on Board this Ship last night from Mudros West base Convalesent Camp where we did not get the best of treatment  By any means indeed lets hope that we get better at Malta any how we could not get [treated?] much worse.
