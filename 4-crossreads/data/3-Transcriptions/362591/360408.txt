<p>months away.  With the actual flying I have so far found no very great difficulty.  It is certainly a strain the whole time but one can become accustomed to that <strike>in time</strike> by degrees.  It will probably take me longer than other fellows on account of my absurdly sensitive temperament.  In the meantime if I get a chance of going to France for observation work I shall probably postpone the "piloting" for the present.  I have a great desire to be in France this summer.</p>
<p>Am down in London on a couple of days leave.  Today the streets are crowded along a certain route marked out for the procession for the Anzac Day celebrations.  I had quite a job getting across the Strand from Trafalgar Square.  This afternoon W.M. Hughes will address a gathering at His Majesty's Theatre.  All the seats were booked up some days ago.  It will be interesting to hear how the day was marked in the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>Spring, tho' deferred, is doing its best to make the country more worth living in.  Today there is sunshine in London and I anticipate a run out to Richmond Park this afternoon.  Hyde Park &amp; Kensington Gardens are becoming more interesting and more appreciated from week to week.</p>
<p>I sent out a couple of roughish photographs to Dorothy by last "Suez" mail.  They were taken in a hurry but are not particularly bad.  If you should prefer one of them very much to the other I can let you have another copy.</p>
<p>I hope Keith's pathway has at last become more smooth.  He certainly has had a sickening number of schools of instruction.</p>
<p>Possibly now that the Australians are in France I may get a chance of seeing Arthur or Caesar or some of the others on leave in London.  I look forward to doing so.</p>
<p>With kind regards to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; yourself<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/>L.O'G. Whitfeld</p>
