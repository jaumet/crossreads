<p>Nov 24th<br/>Sidrat el Harariyeh<br/>2 miles south west of Esdud.</p>
<p>From Nov 17-21st we remained outside Jaffa the NZs having just beaten us into the town &amp; so we were just holding an outpost line a few miles ahead of Jaffa &amp; then we were relieved by two regiments of the 2nd Bgde. and then came back here which is about 20 miles below Jaffa taking two days to do it in, whether for a rest, which is badly needed, or because they cannot feed us I dont know.</p>
<p>The horses have been living on neat</p>
