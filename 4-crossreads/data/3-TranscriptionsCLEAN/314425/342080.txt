I was again out for a long walk with A. Holmes & visited Pont Noyelles and from there went came back & went to the Y.M.C.A.There were several tommies buried in the cemetary this afternoon. I knew nothing about it although I was working a few chains away until I heard the Last Post blown.I saw a fleet of our booming planes very high up - they appeared like birds in the air they were so high - going over to bomb the enemies positions and back areas.There was a heavy straff on this morning. Everyone is expecting a big offensive shortly.
Monday July 1. 1918. 1427.another hot day.There were a number of enemy planes over last night dropping bombs. The enemy was active in shelling the area across the river evidently in search of Batteries dump stables etc.In honour of the Americans the Fourth of July is to be a red letter day in France French & Allied troops will honour the day.I went for a swim in the bathing dam this evening & thoroughly enjoyed it for the day was very hot. In this dam which is very large & deep & made by the French for bathing purposes - the enemy dropped a shell
