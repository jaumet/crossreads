Standing on the water tower hill a fine view in the sunset. To the left Cairo with its minarets the Citadel and the twin minarets of the Mosque M. Ali being the most prominent land mark. In the distance the dim outline of the Pyramids. Closer, the Light Horse Camp. In front Heliopolis the domes of the palace; and the Ibrahim Palace and Mansion de Baron standing out. All around the desert with not a sign of vegetation but varied by the sand hills sweeping away in rear. Dotted all over the desert, small ant-like groups hardly distinguishable from the sand. Rumours of the fall of Achi Baba. Great preparations at hospitals for the receipt of wounded. My batman Mitchell seems to be turning out well. He has the tent very clean comfortable for me, mats and chair, writing table and place for clothes c. Lamp dishes buckets a number of other things have materialised
