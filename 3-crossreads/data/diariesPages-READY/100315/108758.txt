6/4/18 ? Baizieux
We were under orders for the front line in relief of the 12th Bde. The men all very dead tired. Made preliminary arrangements. About 6 p.m. he put down an awful barrage which formed an impressive sight using much shrapnel. Set off with Thewlis about 8 and found our way entirely on the map to where the other people were. A much shelled road now is this main Albert road. Relieved 3 battns. and some pioneers with my chaps seeing Colonels Imlay, Ford, Leane and Major Owen. A pitch dark night many shell bursts, a tale of dead wounded.
