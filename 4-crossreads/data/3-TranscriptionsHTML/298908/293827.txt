<p>Nov. 2nd.  One of our bright birds took a sailor down last night for &pound;60 he got away with it but was caught later on with only &pound;9 in his possession a man like that deserves hanging.<br/>Went to the theatre last night &amp; saw "Yes Uncle" it was very good &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  It was very funny, in the seat behind us was a Yankee officer (Naval) with a pretty low sort of tab &amp; she was blowing him up a treat.  The Yank looked about as silly as a rabbit &amp; was turning all colors, but the girl kept on talking, oh she was a beauty.  The Yanks have got a pretty crook name down here.  They are not at all popular.</p>
<p>No. 3rd.  They are starting to inoculate all the troops here for "flu".  They are not going to get me if I can possibly help it.  I don't believe in their experiments &amp; its nothing more nor less than this at the present time.  I will take a risk if I can dodge the Drs. besides its about spent its fury</p>
