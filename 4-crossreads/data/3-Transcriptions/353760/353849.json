<p>February 14<br/>159.<br/>Tomorrow night the Battalion celebrates Christmas, we here are holding a Bal Masque, enthusiasm seems well spread over the unit, and some good costumes should appear.  Les and Ray C. are Two Ballet girls &ndash; costumes of fancy paper, Namby is taking her children, accompanied by Cowboys &ndash; in the hut here, now there's isolated yarning, and a general working at 'laidite' endurance and at the trimming of weird hats.</p>
<p>We're hoping to produce a second number of Gheitz &ndash; with the Bal Masque as the item of interest, Cartoons by Frank and self, and paragraphs generally.  Contributions to date in Gheitz Box are &ndash; a well-worn half penny and the enquiring "Who was it who bathed in Villian St. lately with a ---?"</p>
<p>However, all things going well, a second number is in the air, and there has been several enquiries.</p>
<p>Back from 3rd Batt. Details, Eric Saxby.</p>
<p>February 14<br/>160.<br/>From a Boche plane dropped into the ground by hut a balloon loaded with illustrated papers &ndash; printed in French.  Some fine photographs of prisoners at Cambrai, the high Boche Council and of captured French towns.  Also some rather good Boche Cartoons from Lustige Blatter.</p>
<p>161.<br/>Turning I yesterday read an hour of "Selections from The Writings of Lord Dunsany".</p>
<p>162.<br/>Another of Ray's bulls, he talking to another chap who questioned answers "Well my answer to that is in the <strike>affirmative</strike> negative!"  Ray &ndash; "Never mind your negative or adjectives, I want a plain yes or no!"  Telling it to Basil, heard another of two chaps at Buire &ndash; "What's a deux Franc", "Two Francs you silly --!"</p>
<p>163.<br/>Although I'm stronger now in books than I've been since at Wimereux, I'm disappointed still at not receiving books from Davis and Oriole, and the pencils from B.  In</p>
