  
 Saturday 7 October 1916 Weather changeable, spells of sunshine in the morning alternating with wild gusts of wind. In the early morning was awakened by talking & commotion caused by the arrival of a German prisoner from the line : he had been taken while caught in our barb wire, & found to be slightly wounded in the right wrist. A middle-aged man & rather a miserable specimen. In the forenoon was warned for duty at Army H.Q. & after getting things packed up waited all day for the car to come. During the afternoon completed the issue & fitting of new respirators to the mobile machine gunners.
