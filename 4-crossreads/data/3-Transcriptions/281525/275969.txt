<p>13/11/17 Wippenhoek<br/>A dull grey and chilly day with the sound of a raging and unceasing bombardment from the front. 400 of the men bathed this morning at Houpoutre. Thewlis applied for Paris leave and Abercrombie returned laden with the regimental typewriter. All the Caestre people including some officers from the now defunct 6th. Division turned up and rejoined. A terrific bombardment raged until well after dark.<br/>14/11/17<br/>Presentation of medals by General Birdwood. A messed up parade on Brigade's part. After lunch a conference at Bde full of wrangles!. Rode home through the dark along silent roads in a misty rain. Padre to hospital.<br/>15/11/17<br/>Raw cold day with early twilight. Pay day. Sports in the afternoon provided some amusement. Now have officers definitely in charge of sports canteen reading rooms &amp;c. Leon Barbier called on a visit. Amusingly downhearted about La Guerre.</p>
