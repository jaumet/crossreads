fought their first action along with some of the English Divisions. The fight was known as the Battle of Fromelles or the Fleurbaix Stunt. Whatever the result of the Stunt from a military point of view was it [?] disastrous to our 5th Division who had the honour of being the first Australians to have a real stunt in France. Our division suffered very heavily. We lost a very large number Killed, wounded, our Fine division crippled in one bloody field which only lasted 12 hours quite a lot of this stunt has been written so I don't think I will dwell on the Battle being in a Field Amb. Iam not in a position to judge but I will say this that it's the infantryman who pays in all of these hardolups & mistakes
