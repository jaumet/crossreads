<p>20-11-18<br/>Dear old Frank<br/>This is not a very pretty Postcard, but I thought you might like it because I got it in a German dug out, and I suppose the German must have taken it, (&amp; Ruths) from a French Soldier.</p>
<p>Yesterday I went to London, and who do you think I saw? why the King and Queen, and the Prince of Wales, and Princess Mary, so what do you think of that?<br/>I wish you had been there too and to see all the Soldiers in beautiful Uniforms, and everything. Lots of love from Dad XOXOXO</p>
