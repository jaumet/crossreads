  
 twice now, it is a most bewildering city, one cannot get away from the stink of Egyptian cigarettes, that everybody smokes.  we  I am now in a foreign land, & every moment I am aware of it. The nigers are everywhere, and in the streets, everybody is trying to sell you something, & everything imaginable is sold. The boot blacks are a pest, while having refreshments, they will crawl under the table to clean your boots, 1/2 piastre 'the charge' is. A piastre is equal to 2 1/2 d Am getting the hang of the coinage now, they are [indecipherable] & piastres. The piastres are both nickel & silver. 1/2 Pt. 1 Pt nickel. 1 Pt., 2 Pt, 5 Pt., 10 Pt., 20 Pt, in silver coins. for an Australian note I have got 97 Pt. for a 10/- note 481/2 Pt. Yesterday I sent a shawl to Louie & mother. Louie's was a lovely blue costing  1 or 97 Pt., Mothers was a pink one 16/-. Each parcel cost 10 Pt. to register. The native buziness place is wonderful, yet very filthy & sickening, but in the new quarters, it is very nice.
