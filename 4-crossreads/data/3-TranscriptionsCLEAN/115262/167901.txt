  
 Monday 14 May 1917. 
 Up at 6.30 am. Feeling crook, but soon seemed to pick up again. 
 Sea at present not quite so rough.  Nothing in sight but water.  All the boats in sight number 10 transports, 2 cargo boats & 2 destroyers. "Warrego" & "Encounter" 
 We have now caught up the boats from Sydney. Seas heavyâ€•boat shipping a few. 
 "Shropshire" in front of us rolling terribly. Able now to stand it down below. Took 2 snaps of "Shropshire" rolling. Went below & wrote 6 letters. 
 Glad to turn in at 6 p.m. as the seamen told us that towards morning we would be entering 'the bight.  Have now turned West towards direction of the Bight.
