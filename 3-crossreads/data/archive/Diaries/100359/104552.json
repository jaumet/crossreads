An advance party of R.A.M.C. came into camp last night. We straightened up all the tents and got the stuff burning nicely when the Sanitary squad corporal arrived on the scene with 20 niggers. We set the niggers on cleaning out the incinerator and scrubbing out the cookhouse then they took clean sand and scattered it all round the cookhouse and we left everything in tip top condition. We had everything finished by 9 o'clock then we had some breakfast. Beef Tea and cocoa, then we all had a shave and a wash and loaded up our packs. Capt Wooster told us that we could do as we liked the rest of the day and gave us a pass for Ismalia. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a5299066\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 66]<br><br />\nFriday May 26th  <br><br />\nKept jolly busy burning off superfluous stuff so as to be clear when we have to move.<br><br />\nThis morning it was read out on Parade, that Gen.
