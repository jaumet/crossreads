<p>Yours dated 12.5.18 to hand with Dave's letter to you enclosed. I havnt done anything about the power of attorney yet cant get a chance to see a lawyer about it - I am going to London on leave shortly &amp; will fix things up then through the High Commissioner. So you knew young McCulloch, he was a particularly bright officer, he was a private in my company then got his commission after Bullecourt - he was killed by a long-range gun on a railway station - very hard luck.<br/>Well my dear I am out of the war at present - have what is called a soft job - am now an Instructor at a Military school in France. Will last about 6 months bar accidents - if the old Bn. strike trouble I will bolt from here &amp; get in again - they sent quite a few of us away for a spell - old Tom</p>
