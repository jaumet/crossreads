  
 walk from the Club where I was to work.  While in London I had a real good look around seeing some of the principle sight that had to be seen, and also enjoying myself very much.  I remained in London about 9 weeks, and then my head came against me I had to leave the work and go in hospital. 
 The work in London consisted of serving meals out and doing odd job's it was at the War Chest Club, Horseferry Rd, London. 
 This place I may mention is a big hostel for soldiers, and they can accommandate 600 in the two bit hall's for sleeping.  This place is also run by funds provided by the people of Sydney, and it provides a lot for the Tommies as well as our boys.
