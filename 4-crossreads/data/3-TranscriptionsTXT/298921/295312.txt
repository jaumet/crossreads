1915 Sunday December 19As we evacuate the Peninsular tonight I may as well say so & if Johnny Turk gets me I have sent my Diary by an officer to post who went last night - a jumble of notes written in odd places of our life here -I am one of the very last to leave this we consider a compliment - All my kit has gone, so if taken prisoner it will be cold - but we intend giving Abdul a good go for it - first - The boys are writing fare well messages to the Turks some are very amusing but there is a very sad side of the question which we all feel as we pass the graves of our mates. Tis true Tis pity & pity tis tis true - Fleas bad
