 Reconnaisance.  T'was here or near-abouts that Napoleon lost all his Cavalry, perished for Water, our movements are regulated by how much Water we have in our Water bottles & the condition of the Horses - very sandy, very HOT.  Got some Camels, Goats, & Bedouins only this stunt.  Our C.O who is a hot headed Irishman, said, when we were sent to find the aeroplane last week- "To hell, with their BALLOONS" "Ill not have my men perished, trying to find their b---dy Balloons" Each day one aeroplane accompanies us & drops a little bag with a message in it now & again to give us information.
