<p>Friday 24 August 1917.</p>
<p>Turned out at 7 a.m. Fed camels and later on took them for a dip in the surf. The breakers bowled a couple of them over. Saddled up after breakfast&nbsp;<s>and</s>&nbsp;watered camels, &amp; filled &quot;fantasies&quot;</p>
<p>Did a little more washing.</p>
<p>Allied planes keeping a good watch over us today. Troops moving out from, &amp; others moving in to the beach rest camp.</p>
<p>[Transcriber&#39;s note: &quot;fantasies&quot; were large rectangular cross-section water containers used in the desert war, also sometimes used for hot tea.
