<p>Octobre 3<br/>We have had a good rest today &ndash; very little doing except a little Coy fatigue. At night went with Sgt Morrison &amp; Cpl Funnell to a cinema at Reningheltz.</p>
<p>Octobre 4<br/>Coy resting well again today. Great news of the 1st &amp; 2 Div advance. Prisoners reportedly coming in freely very little resistance having been met with. Advance is practically in front of the ground we advanced over in front of "Polygone Wood".</p>
