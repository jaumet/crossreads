<p>to Matupi Island. We started out at 6 o'clock and stop out for the day.<br/>We had plenty of swimming and sports in the afternoon with the niggers. We were throwing small coins in the water from a wharf and had a diving and jumping match. It was fun to see the little ones about 3 years old swimming in about 12 feet of water.<br/>Well about 5 o'clock we fell in and marched away home again and got back to the barrick about 6 o1 clock. We had low tea and sat on the log talking and thinking when we were leaving thus unearthly place but the time is passing for it won't belong.<br/>We start out on another march for 2 day. We went through the tunnel and then to the beach at the north of the Island. We stop there till 3 o'clock and march 4 more miles further and camp for the night. It was a beautiful march</p>
