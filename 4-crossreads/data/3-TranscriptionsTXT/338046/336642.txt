 1917 Dec 17 through. It was too late to do anything that night, so we put up what shelter we could, made a fire and got into our blankets. I found an old piece of canvas covered with cow manure and used it as a top blanket over my other one. It was smelly but warm. Next morning, we (the signallers and runners found another place, a sort of storeroom closed on three sides with brick walls and opening onto a platform for loading cement into trucks. Bob Goldie (I think) discovered a tarpaulin and got permission from some Froggies, to whom the tarpaulin did not belong to keep it. we nailed the tarp over the front of the storeroom and were all nicely settled when the transport officer came along with his hoboes and said that they had been given that position, so we reluctantly moved taking with us, our tarpaulin, to the transports disgust. McDermott salvaged another big tarpaulin from a railway truck and we made another joint in a corner we also commandeered a bale of hay from the transport and carefully his it underneath our original.
