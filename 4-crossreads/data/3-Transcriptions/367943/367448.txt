Master of the popylar "Marella" on the Sydney - Singapore run for many years, he did magnificent service with his ship at the evacuation of Singapore.<br/>Defying the orders of the Dutch Naval people to evacuate his berth alongside, he remained to take on water and crammed the ship with every available evacuee, steamed unescorted to Fremantle.<br/>He was awarded his O.B.E. for meritorious  service at sea.</p>
<p>NOTE. Part of the accompanying diary is probably a self written transcript of a rough diary of his experience in Germany.<br/>During his internment Captain Donaldson kept a day to day diary on a roll of toilet paper. This survived and on his death was given to his nephew for presentation to the War Museum in Canberra.<br/>Cross reference to the above may be had from his book "Fifty Years too Soon'" by Whitcombe and Toombs Pty. Ltd., 1948<br/>Captain Donaldson died in 1949. His ashes were commited to the Torres Straits from the deck of B.P.'s "Burnside". He held a Pilot Exemption for this very tricky passage.</p>
