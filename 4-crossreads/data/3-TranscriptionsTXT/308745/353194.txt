on, almost immediately after, he was hit by a heavy bullet in downward direction - alas! a mortal wound - as Bryan would be bending forward, and from what his orderly told me, I am confident that a native did not cause the injury, but from the Germans who had occupied the first trench & intended to cut off Bowen who was pressing on to the second line.  Bryan mercifully became unconscious  as well.  Poor Elwell, a fine man indeed, fell with several men in near vicinity when later sent in support.  Col Howse & Capt Maguire will no doubt tell you that Bryan partially regained consciousness & passed away very gently on board the Berrima.The vessel was ordered to Herbertshohe, a few miles nearer Rabaul in the afternoon early.  Maguire & I had the sad arrangements to make for burial for Bryan & Williams, who died shortly afterwards, a funeral boat was sent ashore with the bodies wrapped in the loved union flag - as boat moved off all the men on Berrima & Sydney paid tribute to gallant men who died in battle. - we were all completely overcome.I would like you to know that Bryan was buried with every honour due his rank & gallantry.  The A.M.C. acted as bearers for our dear man & Naval recruits for Williams.  The White cemetery is almost a mile from the shore in a peaceful spot, surrounded by giant palms and just as dusk was closing in, with a company of infantry men reversed arms A.M.C. Naval party, [indecipherable] a dozen officers, gathered round decent Christian graves, & we saw a most deeply loved comrade buried with head towards Sydney - any one who attended will not forget the quiet scene when the last post was sounded.We were all so proud of Bryan - a charming gentleman, & gallant soldier, who gave up his life to alleviate pain of his comrade, a manly man to the last ounce, & died nobly in action - no man can  be capable of more
