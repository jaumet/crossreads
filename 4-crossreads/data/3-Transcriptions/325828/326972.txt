<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Since I last wrote to you on the 20th Inst. I have  received two letters from you viz:-  yours of the 24th June on Sunday last, &amp; today I have just received yours of 10th. July.  Thank you very much for them Father dear, &amp; also for the 2 prints of the photos of the picnic I was very glad &amp; pleased to get the photos.  I think that you Mother &amp; Ol are looking well according to the camera, &amp; that An is quite fat, at any rate, fatter than when I left.  This last letter you remember, was posted the same time as the one you sent via Frisco   The one via Frisco reached me 8 days (i.e on 19th inst.) ago whereas the other one only arrived to-day.<br/>This letter leaves here on 4th proxo (Sept) via Vancouver, so you might please let me know when it reaches you<br/>We are having fine but windy weather &amp; it seems very strange weather for</p>
