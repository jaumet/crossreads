The houses were wretched examples of architecture.  Some jutted into the street further than others, and some were actually inclined and in a perilous predicament.  They had low windows of small panes of bubbly glass, and nearly all had fresh pot-plants, and white lace curtains.  The village girls darted out of sight like rabbits when they saw us, but we noticed that when returning along the same road, the windows each held a row of inquisitive female faces from baby upwards.
