63 wks of soldiering abroad.
I took the old Triumph in to the garage this morning when there got the prettiest little dog imaginable met the troop waggon on its way into Gherisha for the kit bags. Pard who was in charge was thrown off his horse in Cairo so I rode it from there on, got out to the show grounds at 5.15 found the place closed up, it seems the lads only work a few hours, so we had to come home, by the way we lost out little dog there also, we then called in at the Cairo railway station for the bicks but they were also closed up so then we came home in record time had tea got cleaned with Harold went down the town paid a visit to the Kursaal which wasn't too bad, after having the usual feed we strolled home turned in hoping that the morrow may bring forth something fresh.
Motors arrive.
