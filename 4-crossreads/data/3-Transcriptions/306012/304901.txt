<p>de Mai is a large wood between the villages of Cardonnette &amp; Querrieu.  We are living a really open air life.  There are no tents or huts and we have constructed little bivouac shelters under the trees with our groundsheets.  Fortunately the weather is fine and sunny although the nights are sharp.</p>
<p>Tuesd. 4th June<br/>Canteens are few &amp; far between and it is very difficult to get writing paper, envelopes, biscuits, chocolate, cigarettes, etc. which are now only coming forward in small quantities through the Exped. Force Canteens in the base towns.  Sometimes we run a small canteen ourselves in the Ambulance.<br/>The Bois de Mai is surrounded by 4 villages &ndash; Allonville, Cardonnette,</p>
