<p>Wed. Mar/12.<br/>The weather is quite mild today &amp; the sea is fairly calm. We received the 10/- prize today for having the best kept Hospital. Cowell, Kelly, Postill &amp; I played a hand at Poker, as it wasn't  worth while splitting up the 10 bob. Cowell had a pair of Jacks, &amp; I drew a pair of Kings, &amp; so won.<br/>We also raffled the water colour that Gribble painted, &amp; a chap named Nash won it with 10/-. After Tea there was a Boxing Tournament, which was most amusing &amp; passed a couple of hours away quite pleasantly. We expect to arrive at Fremantle on Friday morning, so these W.A's only have another day to spend on the Boat.<br/>Thur. Mar.13<br/>The W.A.'s are all polishing up their Gear today &amp; preparing for the great event of going ashore &amp; Home. Kirkbride &amp; Cunningham are the only two on Ship's Staff. We are getting along at a fair rate so we ought to arrive at Fremantle early tomorrow morning. I wrote a few lines to B.E., but couldn't say much, as I don't know when we are likely to be Home. Also wrote out a couple of wires, one for Lill &amp; one for Mother so that Kirkbride can take it ashore with him tomorrow. Gilbert, Lakin, Cowell &amp; I played a Game of Cribbage which passed away a very pleasant Hour. We only have four patients in Hospital now, so things are quiet. It is a Lazy Life, &amp; we shall feel it when we have to start work again.</p>
