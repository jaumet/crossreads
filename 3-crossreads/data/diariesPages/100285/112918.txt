no more pleased man in this Camp tonight than he is now I am back am taking it over in the morning, it takes him exactly 4  hours to do what I put over in 2 hours but of course I have got the run of the ropes that's a big thing in such a complicated job. It is raining heavily tonight I have been expecting this for it has been very close muggy all day. rain is quite a common thing in England.
