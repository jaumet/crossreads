But Reg. has been to France & wounded again since then.  I have a letter here from Him now.  Ellis has just written to Him.  I will probably run down to see Him in a couple of week's time.  He is at Exeter & His Relatives from Somerset have motored over to see Him.  He is doing well He tells us, so His good People need not worry. We have hundreds of German prisoners working round the Camp & making new roads & repairing old ones. I guess You will be proud wearing Your silver medal.  I knew You would have to let us go to the War some day.  I wanted to go from the start. I might have an officer & a true soldier if You had let me go then, but anyway we are here to do what the army tells us to do & have no picking our Jobs. Well, Mum & Dad & George, We are all well & we trust that You are the same.  This is one of our worst months & we've not had a bad day yet.  We have had one poor sort of a fog & about 5 frosty mornings. I must go & see the Barber now & get ready to go to the Theatre.  My Salisbury Friends received Your nice letter, Mum.  I am going in to see them to-morrow, D.V. I will go by Train I think.  It is getting cold on the fingers & toes riding the Bike. Fondest Love to You all. From Harry.
