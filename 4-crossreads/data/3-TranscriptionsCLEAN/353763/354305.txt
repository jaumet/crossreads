  
 Thursday Nov 5 - 14  We are still coaling  -  The collier we are alongside has a suspicious history  -  She is the Cairnhill - the same steamer that, some months back broke her shaft & drifted - up New Ireland way  -  Eventually she was picked up & towed to Townsville  -  One of the destroyers or battle ships picked her up outside Suva & went aboard & examined her papers & found that her cargo - 6000 tons of coal - was consigned - ostensibly - to a German firm in San Francisco  -  She was ordered into Suva with the result that all her coal is commandeered & the fleet benefits  -  That's the yarn anyway  -  Buz has it that the German cruisers wd  have intercepted her & taken the coal & that that was her  real  job of work  -  In the aftn  of yesterday I witnessed a cricket match between the Grantala & the Fijian constabulary  -  The latter were by far the better team  -  They outplayed the Grantala in every department of the game  -  The Fijians were fine specimens of Natives - bare legged & bare footed but when batting they put on pads & used gloves for wicket keeping & played an A1 game  -  Their bit hitting roused great enthusiasm  -  No wicket for over 100  -
