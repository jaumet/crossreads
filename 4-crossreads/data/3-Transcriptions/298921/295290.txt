<p>November, 1915<br/>Saturday 27<br/>Last night was one of the worst thunderstorms I have ever been out in &ndash; Do you remember how the storms rolled over the Ranges at Switzerland, this country is similar &ndash; at 3 a.m. I went to my "Bivy" which had been fairly weatherproof, 1 boot half full of water &amp; the Biscuits sodden, several rats had taken refuge in the Dugout &ndash; we are still under orders not to return enemies fire for another 48 hours &ndash; the question is will they come.</p>
