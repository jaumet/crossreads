 30-7-16 Sun 30th Watkins managed to crawl back from the Turkish lines after dark tonight &amp; was found by the 6th L.H. Regt. this morning &amp; brought into hospital.  reports from the Field Anb. state that Barrows wound is not as bad as we feared &amp; all who were wounded yesterday will probably live;  We had no enemy planes over today; 
 This morning at 4 oclock we had to supply 2 signal stations for Mount Meredith &amp; Mt Royston  I sent Leask &amp; Watson, &amp; Edwards &amp; Cabban, a section of men had to go with each station as guard.  Life is much better here now as we get from midnight till 6 oclock after coming off a 'stunt' instead of standing to Arms at 3 oclock, if the Stand to Arms had not been cut out the men would  not have been able to stand it.
