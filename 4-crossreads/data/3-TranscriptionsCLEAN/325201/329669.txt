headed individual called Molden went to James this morning for his bread issue - They are in the same mess. Now Molden is also a bit deaf & that is the funny part of it for, when Molden asked for his bread, James thou'ght (he had not drawn it) that Molden was accusing him of pinching it, and promptly offered him out (i.e to fight him). Thus Molden of course did not hear him, and you never saw such a surprised man as Molden was when Biff! bang! & he was knocked up against a waggon.
