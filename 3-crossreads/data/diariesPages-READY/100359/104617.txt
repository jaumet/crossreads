Had a very rough tea tonight. The stew was very weak, and we had no vegetables. There were plenty of shells flying around today. Fritz is sweeping the road with his machine guns, so we are hoping we don't have any cases tonight. It's not healthy. Wrote a long letter to M.S. as it may be the last chance for a time.
Thursday, 12th
Stan Wright and the rest of our party went into De Niepper Baths, which we greatly enjoyed. We had dinner at a cottage just behind Headquarters. Eggs, toast and coffee, which was a pleasant change after Trench Fare, They are busy packing up at H.Q. ready for a move. The Somme is favorite, but of course we are going. On our way back to the trenches. Mac I stayed for a time and watched one of our batteries send a few souvenirs over to Fritz. We also went up to the O.P. and watched them bursting in the German Lines. Just after tea word was sent around that everyman not on duty in the lines, was to stay in his dugout as our guns were going to bombard very heavily, prior to a Raid. A few minutes of Sullings and Murph arrived and informed us that 4 of us out of the 8th were to proceed to No. 2 post at once. The air went blue for a time, but "orders is orders" and we had to go. We tossed up to see which of us should go,, and our party lost. So we grabbed our coats and started off. No sooner had we got outside our dug-out than Bang, Bang.Whizz third Bun-er-er, Bang the shells commenced to scream overhead, and stones and dirt were flying in all directions. The flash from the guns lit up the sky for miles around. Fritz had a searchlight going and what with this and the hundreds of star shells it was as light as day, and made us feel decidedly uncomfortable as we crossed some of the open spaces. The machine guns and rifles were also very busy and their hiss and pig scattered leaves and bark off the trees.
