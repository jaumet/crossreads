<p>The Empire Nurses Red Cross Club, Cairo<br/>24 Jan 1916</p>
<p>My beloved Mother<br/>Here I am quite safe from over the sea at Lemnos. We arrived on Saturday 22nd January &ndash; about 9am and dropped anchor in the harbour, we came up to the wharf on Sunday at 11am and while waiting for our special train to take us to Cairo our mail came &ndash; 61 bags in a motor ambulance. I got two letters from you</p>
