<p>Battle of Telekebar</p>
<p>Original trenches still to be seen at Telekebar</p>
<p>The English history in connection with Egypt really started in 1881 &ndash; When Mahommed Ali started his reign of extravagance &ndash; the National debt of Egypt at the time amounting to about &pound;3,000 000 &ndash; but this was soon increased as Ali thought it was such a simple &amp; convenient way to borrow large sums &amp; just pay small sums of interest annually for such &ndash; he thought nothing of building Mosque's &ndash; Palaces etc. On one occasion a Princess advised him she intended to visit Egypt &amp; would like to visit the Pyramids, Ali set about &amp; built a beautiful road from Gezirch Palace to the Pyramids in 3 days by forced labour &ndash; when the National debt got to 93 millions England thought it was time she looked to some securitys &ndash; together with other little facts such as Consuls &amp; other Officials who used to generally die of Appolexy, together with rebellions &amp; massacres. An English party came to Alexandria but were not strong</p>
