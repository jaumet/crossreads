<p>Wed 22nd May (cont.)<br/>The village was almost asleep at such an hour;  our train pulled out at 7.45 am.</p>
<p>Jago, my compagnon de voyage, is a 1914 prisoner &amp; is a bit dotty in a cheerful manner.</p>
<p>His tale, alas, is Touching!  Quaite! (as Aubrey E. says)</p>
<p>Was in command of a ship in the Baltic in 1914, essayed to run out, was captured, and spent his time in Deutschland clamouring that he was a civilian, despite the fact that he has been in officer's camp for so long.</p>
<p>Last week a batch of officers left for Holland under the 18 months exchange agreement.   Jago was to go with them.   Alas and alack, some spiteful Bureau remembered our friend's pleas to be treated as a civilian;   they cancelled his officer's passport and he is now en route to the civilian camp at Ruhleben, his wish to be treated as a "civvy" now being acceded to!   We pulled into the Stettiner Bahnhof at 10.30 am.</p>
