 4 am Sentry wakes us up to tell us the spot we are guarding is full of Turks. We open fire with rifles  &  machine guns  &  apparently drive them out No more are seen after daybreak but some snipers must have been left for we keep getting bullets over We lost several men killed  &  some wounded. Expected relief does not arrive so make arrangements for another night
