 way of City building alright.  Met Billy Mahoney on our way here he is a Corporal in Signallers 30th Battalion, so have now accounts of all the Office Boys who are on this side, excepting Roy Fleming, whom I haven't heard from yet.  Was pleased to get the Wool Catalogues &ndash; don't suppose my idea of values would be much good now on those prices, though I don't think they can be giving Mr. Hanson much cause for worry.  Stock also seems to be bringing high prices. 
 Had a talk with the Major at our last camp, first since we left.  He is too far up for Privates to be visiting too often.  One has to be careful.  Have received, I think, all the Home letters lately and also the Sunday Times, so things that way are right again. 
 Don't think there will be much chance of seeing Chas. or Os. from here, but hope to run across them before long.  Billy I suppose is on his way now.  I'm glad I've had one lot of excitement in front of them all, as I will be able to talk to them pretty big now. 
 Hope you are O.K. again and also Mr. Doyle.  Have any more of "Her" invaded the sacred precincts yet? 
 Can't think of any more news as it doesn't grow in desert, so I think I had better knock off and catch live stock. 
 Am still in the best of health, thank goodness. 
 Best wishes to all in the Office, and love to All at Home. 
 Your affectionate Son, Roy. 
 By the way I could do with a new razor and gear.  My piece of Army Hoopiron is getting very pliable.
