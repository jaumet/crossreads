<p>marched via Enab to Jerusalem along a good metal road, but owing to the heavy rain, wind &amp; cold prevailing at this altitude, very little interest was taken of our surroundings. The Regt camped near the N.E. corner of the Old City. A person generally judges a place from his first impressions, &amp; I'm afraid a great percentage of the troops were very disappointed in what they saw. The Bgde camped here for three days &amp; the men were given every opportunity of visiting both the old City &amp; the New, &amp; from what I can gather were greatly disillusioned, although there were undoubtedly a great many things of interest to be seen the weather had damped their ardour. The whole place like most cities we passed through was horribly dirty, perhaps more so than normal owing to the rain, but since its occupation by British Troops a new era has started. Jerusalem has been "swept" clean &amp; its sanitation greatly improved. Whilst here we had a few hours of sunshine &amp; the men took this opportunity to dry their clothes &amp; clean their equipment.</p>
<p>Leaving Jerusalem on the 21st we encamped at Wadi Ektief for three days, on the bed of a Wadi, the ground being very rough &amp; facilities for watering very difficult.</p>
