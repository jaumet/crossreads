<p>My dear dear boy,<br/>I can't let you go without telling you what you know already, that you will be in our thoughts night &amp; day.  Our first &amp; last thoughts will always be of you.  Mother and I want you to remember, and I think it will be a pleasure to you to remember, that the great joy of our life has been the pride we take in our children, in dear Dorothy &amp; our fine straight going clean souled boys.  We have no shadow of misgiving as to how you will conduct</p>
