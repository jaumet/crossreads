<p>for the trip now being 3 killed &amp; 3 wounded. Tomorrow I am told the remainder of our 1914 men leave. A great deal of talk about a chamber of horrors in the Canal tunnel, several declare that 'tis a boiling down works of the enemy when his dead are rendered down for fat, too hard to believe but several have told me that they have seen it with bodies actually in the vats. Had a look at the Canal near where it enters the tunnel, 'tis very deep down, the sides being steel &amp; nicely wooded, altogether a beautiful sight with a fine stone arch bridge over it, which somehow has escaped destruction, yet had received several knocks.<br/>Thursday 3rd Oct.<br/> up about 7 &amp; had orders to prepare for leaving almost at once so pulled down our tent &amp; loaded most of our gear on the cars. Sent it off to our waggon lines. In the meantime the 2nd Div. had hopped over &amp; the hun was putting a few shells over close by. By 10 we were all on our way back &amp; on arrival learnt that a few shells had landed in our camp killing</p>
