Dear Mrs. Hill,
It is with the deepest regret that I write to you about the death of your son, Sgt. Hill. I had not known him long but I cannot find words to tell you how sadly he is universally missed - he did his job with great courage and even after being so seriously wounded insisted that his job should be carried out before he himself was attended to. He died a few days ago in the Casualty Clearing Station, a few hundred yards from here and is buried close by with many of his comrades. I have thought perhaps you would like to know that the Company has placed a very neat Cross over the grave which is suitably inscribed.
Please accept my very deepest sympathy in the great loss that you have sustained for your son was a very gallant and brave gentleman. Before he died he asked me to write to you which I do now and have also recommended him for a decoration for his bravery and faithfulness to his duty. I regret exceedingly his untimely end.
Yours very sincerelyE.A. Atkinson, Capt.O.C. "C" Coy.19th Batt. A.I.F.
