<p>On stools milking cows. Some of our chaps said that when <u>they</u> did any milking in Australia, they had to put the darn cow in the bails and see that she was well legroped in. If they wandered pout into the paddock and tried to do any milking with the first cow they met, there would soon be a mixture of cow, bucket, stool and man, that would take some sorting out. We arrived at Tidmouth about 7 p,m and disentrained. We formedup and started on a five mile march to camp. The roads were well made, and were  flanked by high hedges of hawthorn, with chestnut trees loaded with nuts, overhanging from each side. We soon realised what the famous "Green lanes of England" really were. There were no footpaths, but the sides of the roads at the foot of the hedges, were lined with red poppies, buttercups, daisies, and clover, that eclipsed anything we had seen previously. We marched into Parkhouse No 2 Training Camp about 8.30, very tired and hungry. After seeing the O.CX, we were allotted to tents, and given tea. The sun sets here about 9.30 p,m, and then we have several hours of twilight. One of the first men we met on arrival, was Bill Ransley, and he was very pleased to see us. Hillcoat  and the others  have gone over to France. They did not expect us to be here very long, as they are very short of A.M.C. men in France at present. They are not sending men who are over 40 years of age, so Bill R. has to stop in England. The boys under 19 years are also being kept on this side until they reach that age. There are about 300 of them in camp here, from all units, and a bigger set of young larrikins never lived. Some of them have done good work at the front</p>
