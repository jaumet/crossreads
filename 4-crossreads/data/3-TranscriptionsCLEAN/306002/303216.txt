  
 2.7.15 Fri. 2nd.  A sap is being put up through our dug-outs, we sig's have had nothing to do to-day, as Nelson has failed to secure a buzzer or Heliographs to practise with.  This afternoon a New Zealander dropped his rifle by accident, it went off & the bullet went through his knee.  This morning we had some excitement as a kite was up from one of the boats observing.  A parachute was either freed or broke away & came sailing down & fell between our trenches & the Turks, at least it appeared to be, some papers also flew out of it, just before it came to the ground, some falling in our lines & some in the Turks.  The Artillery has been fairly busy on both sides to-day & a howitzer firing from towards the beach & dropping shells on the left of Popes Hill is doing considerable damage to the Turks.  Calthorpe was wounded by an 8.2 ins. shell on the face this evening.  Went for a swim again to-day.
