<p>Saturday 12 October<br/>Arrive in Glasgow &amp; at once start sight seeing. The Rouken Glen &amp; Botanic Gardens &amp; then University &amp; Art Gallery. Glasgow, in great contrast to Edinburgh, is a city of business, many people in the streets. There are signs of sedition here too, &amp; many seditious notices are chalked about the pavements.<br/>Blythswood Hotel.</p>
<p>Sunday 13 October<br/>A fine day but not clear. A visit to Loch Lomond, Balloch, but no steamers running.<br/>No doubt, the lake is beautiful, but I was far from being moved when I saw it.  Possibly expected too much. Balloch Park is very fine. A walk round Glasgow this evening in a crowd of people of which I have seen no equal.</p>
