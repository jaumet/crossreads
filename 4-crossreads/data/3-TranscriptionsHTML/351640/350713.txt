<p>must be sympathy with the most lowly placed, and no favouritism for some as against the crowd, if a human machine is to work properly, and constant interest must be exhibited in every individual.</p>
<p>Noel Paton had bad luck, but he will be right bye &amp; bye.</p>
<p>Of the 8-3-15.  In lead pencil.  The pyramids accident happened before we came here.  No one has fallen down the steps since.  To do so at any time is proof of little sense &amp; still less care, nearly every step is broad enough for one to lie upon it.</p>
<p>My health is first class now.  Eating well, sleeping <strike>well</strike> enough, keeping myself occupied by reading and writing when there is leisure, riding at times, and doing whatever share of the hospital duties fall to my lot.  In good fettle now.</p>
<p>You have had lots about my room.  It is much more comfortable than is any tent &amp; the electric light gives me enough of its rays to satisfy all my requirements, and you know that they are exacting in this regard.  The globes were becoming dull last week, but the electrician brought new ones and now, they shine brilliantly.  We have not been victimised in any way that I know of.  Glad you enjoyed the picnic to "Paddy's Hut".  Good.  The garden appears to have been a success this year.  Who has been head gardener?  Salvia of the best.  None was there in my time.<br/>Have not heard from Dr Harris lately, he told me in his last about the holiday trip to England and parts of France.  Yes he is of the best.  Why did he resign from the Sydney Hospital.  Has Dr Ayres been given the position?  Carmichael fell out with Holman.  A pity for both.  Strong men the two.  Ablest pair in the Ministry.  I hope that Maria will do all correct with Walter Bentley.  When she has no board or rent to pay she should be happy.</p>
