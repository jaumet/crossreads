<p>Franurra<br/>Rooty Hill.<br/>10.9.1918</p>
<p>My Dear old Daddy Dumpling.</p>
<p>We stayed at home for two days because we had a <strike>bad</strike> cold so we stayed home from school.  We went to Parra-Matta to-day all three of us.  Frank is   <strike>wait</strike> writing to you and mum said that she was going to   <strike>wright</strike> write too.  We had a nice time at Parra-Matta.  Frank has got a <strike>whole</strike> whole page done and I have only.  I fed the horse and mum said I did not give him anough.  I was going to tell you how much I had.  But Mum said that I was silly to do it so I left off.  Mum brough me a new pair of Patent Leather shoes, they were not Botton-up's they are a bit big and as I was walking along the street one of the shoes fell off.  Mum brough herself some shoes but they were not Patent Leather but black Kid.  Mum is writing so quickly and I started before her and she has got on before me.  I think I weill have to go over tho the Dub sone.</p>
<p>12.9.1918.<br/>I have finished one of the letters but if I have finished this too I cannot send It because the letter is nearly full so I can only send one.  Mum has done a lot, Frank has done alot.  We are going to Rooty Hill to see if we can get any letter's from you.  But yesterday we went down to get some letter's and got some on our way. Back we called in to Mrs. Shaws and stayed for the whole day and then came home.</p>
