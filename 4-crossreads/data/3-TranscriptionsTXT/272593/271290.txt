 1 till 5 in the morning a pretty long stretch. I was sound asleep when Jock came round &amp; woke me up and told me it was my "watch" so up I gets &amp; hops out, it was snowing lightly &amp; very cold, the first thing I do is to pay all the "posts" a visit  this takes nearly an hour for they are so scattered, after hopping over the parapet I find that the recently fallen snow has covered all our tracks &amp; I can see that I shall have to be careful for I might easily walk into the German trenches. however I find 21 post safely &amp; they report everything correct the next post is easily found but not so 19 but a friendly flare or two came to my aid making the snowy night as bright as day the falling snow looked very pretty
