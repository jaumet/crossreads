<p>2/3/19 Marcinelle<br/>Usual morning yarn round at 22nd. At 1.30 left for Gourdinne in a Ford ambulance and commenced a round of visits. Madame Crochelet produced a good bottle of wine and then I went round to Legaits and had coffee and biscuits with the charming Yvonne &amp; family. Then down to the Brasserie where were M. Fernand, Mdlle Anna, The Secry of the Commune &amp; another friend. We drank wine and talked and they had all long since reached the conversational stage. They are a wise race and have all the pleasures of imbibing without ill after-effects by observing proper restraint in keeping away from drunkeness. Gave Yvonne a lift back to Charleroi in our car and after dinner I wrote and read.</p>
