After we had finished the Municipal engineer arrived.  He told us we would not start work till Monday, so during the afternoon we made some tea and cooked some eggs which we bought from people passing along the road.

During our stay we were continually running out of provisions, not even getting our proper bread supply.  Needless to say we were continually complaining about the shortage of food.  At 4.a.m. 19th July, a man on a horse came galloping into the camp and informed the sentries that we were to return to Afionkarahissar at once, so everything was hurry and bustle.  We started on our journey back about 6 a/m.  We thought that perhaps the war was drawing to a close and that we were going back to be released.  These hopes were soon dashed to the ground for when we got back Afionkarahissar we found everything in a bustle, not because we were going to be released but because some officials had come from Headquarters at Constantinople to enquire into our treatment generally.  When we arrived back we found that we had been joined by some new prisoners, Sergeant Delpratt, Pte. Allen, a Gurkah and two Frenchmen.  They had arrived on the 18th.
