<p>As I write this there is great excitement out side as 500 Victorian Artillery are embanking yesterday the Thermistocles A.64 went out with two battalions onboard, they covered everything except the funnels. It was a magnificent sight &amp; we cheered till we were hoarse. By cruel management the crowd was not let on to the deck till the boat was nearly out of the pier so could not adjust streamers &amp; pass their friends the many cigarettes chocolates etc which they had brought. But its an ill wind etc. and we scored the lot.</p>
<p>We expect to go at midday to day; first stop Albany. Don't address letters to this ship use the one left. Tell Mr. Thompson how sorry I was not to be able to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Well, tell Mother not to worry and for awhile goodbye.</p>
<p>Love to all.</p>
