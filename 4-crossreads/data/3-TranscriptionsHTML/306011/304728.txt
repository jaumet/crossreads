<p>I was able to secure a few souvenirs. Had a couple of yarns with these Boches and have now picked up a few words of German. Struck one chap who spoke fluent French &ndash; he said he had had quite enough of the war &amp; was quite satisfied to be a prisoner. The same day I had my first talk with some Portuguese. At first it was tremendously difficult as none of them can speak a word of English &amp; I didn't know a word of their language. Yesterday the last of our dark-skinned allies were transferred to their Base at Etaples &amp; my Portuguese lessons &amp; conversation have come to an end. For the past week I have seen a couple of them every day and with the help of a rotten grammar &ndash; (the only Port. book I could find) have made fair progress.
