Tuesday July 24thThe officers in camp here are all getting horses, what for no one knows, I suppose they will be alright though, until the Officers get tired of them, a new broom always sweeps clean. We are having splendid weather now. An Australian mail came in today, dated May 27th. I have only received up to April 22nd so I can look forward for some now.
Wednesday July 25thA lovely day. Not feeling too good. I am on issue looking after the issue of mugs, plates, & Blankets, it will be a fairly easy job, if the Q.M does not put any more work on me. Shifted to No 28 hut this afternoon. I am there by myself. I have to be on the job. I will mess round at Q.M. Store.Was boarded (medically) this afternoon. There were two Captains & Major Stewart on the board, result classified B.1.B. & return to Weymouth, just what I wanted, it will mean a spell for a while.
Thursday July 26thI have a good deal of work to do now, everything spare in all huts are being shifted to my place, I am trying to get a system to work on, & so far it seems to be working very well.Was paid 1 today. I had more in my pay book, but I though a pound would carry me safely through to next pay.
