<p>The next day we went by tram out to Waterloo (fifteen miles from Brussels) where we spent a whole day seeing all over the historic battlefield.  It was indeed a great privilege to have done this.  The guide took us to the top of the famous lion monument, from where a great view of the Battlefield can be obtained (it is almost a mile square) and he explained the whole battlefield, also the Battle of Waterloo to us, pointing out the various positions that were occupied by the English, French and Germans.</p>

The next day we saw the King's Palace (which was the German Military Headquarters during the occupation &ndash; the spot where Edith Cavell was shot, the famous Manniken monument in the gardens and many other sights.

<p>Stayed the night with my Battalion telling the boys of the great time I had (very few had the luck to get to Paris or Brussels).  Next morning walked over to Headquarters at Rambures and took up billets again with Madame, after my very enjoyable holiday.  Came back with just enough money left to send a cable home to my parents telling them I was well and had been on leave to Paris and Brussels.</p>
