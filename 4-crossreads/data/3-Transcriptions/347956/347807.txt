<p>they are very large thin-skinned oranges; we were paid &pound; 1.0.0 to each man this morning &amp; it was very acceptable as we had only drawn 25/- since we left Rosebery &amp; the canteen is not as cheap as it could have been, to say nothing of the silver we paid paid out to the cooks for cups of tea &amp; eggs &amp; bacon  I believe I am still putting on condition &amp; my mo. is progressing favourably;</p>
<p>just heard from the bridge that we are not to move into the wharf till to-morrow.  at 6.30 to-night Orvieto bade us goodbye &amp; good luck &amp; started on her way to England, I am satisfied we are far enough north as last night was quite chilly it was also showery<strike>yesterday</strike> this afternoon &amp; <strike>last</strike> to-night.</p>
<p>Sat 5th<br/>Last night was quite wintry here &amp; quite cool enough down here on the troop deck with both blankets</p>
