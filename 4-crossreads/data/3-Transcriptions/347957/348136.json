<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I beg to submit a full account of my experiences covering 17 month imprisonment in eight different prison camps &amp; working parties in Germany.</p>
<p>This account was written up whilst I was convalescing on my return to Australia &amp; it contains full details of two escapes.</p>
<p>You will readily understand that it was impossible for me to keep any diary or memorand  because prisoners were frequently searched; but I have given a truthful record of my own experience as a prisoner of war.</p>
<p>I enlisted on July 12th 1915 at Adelaide (two of my brothers also enlisted there, the same week they were both killed in action the same day that I was taken prisoner)</p>
<p>I was a private in the 32nd Batt. &ndash; sailed from Pt. Adelaide Nov. 19th  1915, trained six months in Egypt (Canal Zone) then sent on to France.</p>
<p>In action at Frommelles took our objective but were eventually cut off &amp; made a prisoner with about 300 others English &amp; Australian soldiers.</p>
