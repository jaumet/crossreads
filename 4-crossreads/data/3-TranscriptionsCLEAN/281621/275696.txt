 Monday 30 Beautiful day. Have leave to Amiens where I have a good look round, see citadel & the ancient part of the town, which is very interesting.  Sorry to hear that Harry Bladin has died of wounds. 
 May, 1917 Tuesday 1 May Day, beautiful weather at Pozieres. 
 Wednesday 2 Still at Pozieres & mostly practising at cricket in the best of weather. A very big stunt is about to come off on our front & vague rumours are afloat about the number of men to participate.  Vote on the General Election for Commonwealth. 
 Thursday 3 Vague rumours come to hand as to the results of this mornings stunt. Our 2nd Division took their objective, but on their right apparently the English Division which relieved us failed. Still wait for more particulars. We played & beat the D.S.C. at Albert & they gave us a right royal time. 
 Friday 4 Early this morning A & B bearers were sent to the M.D.S. as reserve bearers. We are just outside the village Vaulx-Vraucourt. Apparently there have been a good number of casualties including ambulance men. The result of the attack is that a wedge has been driven into the Hindenburg line. Beautiful day. 
 Saturday 5 Last night we moved up to the line just behind Riencourt, where a heavy battle is in progress. All night Fritz put up a terrific bombardment & continued it into this morning when I was numbered among the casualties which are very heavy. I think the casualties are heavier also the shelling than at Pozieres.
