<p>Saturday, 24 October, 1914<br/>I awoke at daybreak &amp; on looking out of the porthole was surprised to see land.  We were approaching King Georges Sound &amp; the scenery of the harbour was very pretty.  We were first into the harbour closely followed by the Omrah.  We anchored just outside Albany &amp; before 10 there were five other troopships anchored also.  We were informed that we have to await the convoy here &amp; may be here four days.  I sent wires &amp; mail home.</p>
