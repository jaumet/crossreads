<p>Tuesday 8th, Sea Calm, Islands on both sides, our present destination Lemnos Island in sight.  We arrived in Mudros Bay at 10.30 a.m.  Beautifull place the green hills &amp; fields very pretty after 4 months of desert.  The inhabitants of Lemnos are mostly Greek, but there are 500 Turks on the other side of island under guard, the third Brigade have been here 5 weeks.  There are a lot of Battleships here, among them being the H.M.S. Queen Elizabeth, H.M.S. Queen, London, Doris, Triumph, &amp; Swiftsure, &amp; several Destroyers.  There is one big church with two domes &amp; dozens of quaint old windmills to be seen on shore also a big French Camp.</p>

<p>Wednesday 14th, Landed in Ships, boats under Naval control, disembarked 10 a.m.  Carried out Landing &amp; manouvers in conjunction thereto, passed through fields of red poppies &amp; other fields of white daisies, struck me as peculiar that they didn't grow together.
