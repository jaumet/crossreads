MY dearest Mother   &  Sisters,
Perhaps some of your letters have been lost, we have not had an Aust mail for ages, so hope you are all well. No doubt shall get some soon. Have sent word to Major C-to send all letters for me here. I shall let him know any change in my address. We may be in Belgium soon, but never know. This is a beautiful spot and we are very comfortable also having quite a rest but it
