  
 getting back to the 3rd & incidentally the dispensary job, is not great. Never mind, keep a good heart & all will be well.

My good luck in living so long counteracts any hard luck I have had in not getting promotion A la victoire. 
 23rd March Unexpectedly put on draft yesterday. Handed in all spare kit today. On guard from 5 p.m. yesterday till 5 p.m. today.
