<p>burst into flame, &amp; fell till it vanished in smoke. The Hun plane then turned to the next balloon, we saw two forms come from it, &amp; two parachutes opened &amp; came slowly towards the earth. Fritz fired into that balloon, &amp; it soon burst into flame &amp; was consumed. Our anti-aircraft guns opened, but couldn't hit the brute. We then saw two men jump from a third balloon, &amp; the parachutes opened alright &amp; they came slowly to earth, while the balloon was hauled down before it was destroyed. It was a victory for Fritz alright, who flew back to his own lines; how I wished some of our 'planes were about to give him what for. Sunday 14 July                                                   <br/>D Coy. played B Coy. this afternoon, but it was a rotten match, the wicket being too bad. Some other soldiers were playing on the nice little ground &amp; road pitch where we played C Coy., &amp; we played on a rough wicket over near B Coy. We went in &amp; only got 45, I got bowled first ball. Soon after they went in, it rained, &amp; on this French clay the ball was very slippery to hold, &amp; I couldn't get near my usual pace bowling. However, we managed to get them out for 36, I got 5 wickets. Came back to our pozzy for tea, &amp; I was on piquet. We fell in, Lt. Hall,</p>
