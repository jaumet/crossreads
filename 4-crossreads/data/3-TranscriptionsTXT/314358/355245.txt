 France 19 Nov 1917 Dear Beatrice/ Dear Mother/ 
 Am at present in a peaceful part of France resting 
 It is quite a relief to be away from the active areas of war, far removed from the clamour and roar; and beyond the waste of ruined lands and villiages. Yes it is indeed. 
 Only those who have experienced uncertain life in the forward areas of this war can fully appreciate what it is to once more find oneself in a place of peace where there are civilians pursuing the occupations of life under normal conditions.  To get away from the sight of wreck and ruin; out of the range of shell fire, and from beneath a sky of bombs, is a blessing for which all of us are thankful. 
 To once more see smiling faces and to hear the voices of children. 
 To be able to wander about without concern as to the risks against ones life.
