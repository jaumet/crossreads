<p>Christian names as it is much more sensible out in these God-forsaken parts.  The lucky girl has however gone to England and I am left in the lurch;  she went with 3rd A.G.H. &amp; I don't know anybody in the 14th which has replaced the 3rd.  I tried very hard to get over to France but I had no one to pull wires for me &amp; so they stuck me down here with a weird composite regiment with no esprit de corps and no unity which will become the 4th Aust. Camel Corps very shortly.  I believe Blackburn is physician to 14th A.G.H.<br/>I reckon that conscription is a dead cert. now that the Army &amp; the women have a vote &amp; I hope they exterminate those Broken Hill imbeciles.</p>
