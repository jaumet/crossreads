<p>10 Rough im thinking What?<br/>Later. Arrived at 2 soon post, crossed Canal in punt, walked about 3 miles along Canal, crossed arm of Bitter lakes in a small punt (9 men at a time) &amp; finished up at G--- something post about 1.25 &ndash; just 4.20 hrs marching, &amp; over sand nearly all the time. Passed a couple of white Swans &amp; scores of other wild fowl. No end of boats on the Canal, &amp; warships in the Lakes. Built a swimming jetty &amp; had a dip. This is a home from home. All a chap has to do is 4 hrs patrol; duty up &amp; down the Canal every 2nd night &amp; you have a mate too. Harry is quite pleased &amp; so am I. Only 5 in our tent. Have cleaned her out &amp; watered the floor. A couple of the boys have gone fishing. A native comes over every day with fruit, groceries etc which one orders the previous day.</p>
<p>11 Harry &amp; I on patrol duty from 6 pm to 6 this morning. Did 4 hours together up &amp;</p>
