<p>Today raining again, going Church if possible (nobody does go apparently these days) in evening have seats to hear HORATIO BOTTOMLEY lecture on "What I saw in France". This Hotel is right on the sea &amp; always blowing &amp; squally. Later. Lecture not much good but JOHN BULL as Bottomley is known as says the War will be over by XMAS, I thinks <u>not</u>.</p>
