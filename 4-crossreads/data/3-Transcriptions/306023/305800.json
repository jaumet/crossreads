<p>I went along Victoria Street, where as an Australian I attracted a good deal of attention, some of it very unwelcome too on account of the gazers, to the Abbey. There I found that there was to be a performance of the "Elijah" by a choir from Yorkshire, which I would very much have liked to hear, but I was pulled up by several kiddies selling programmes so I thought that I might not have the price of admission and did not try to obtain entrance. One can imagine my chagrin when I found afterwards that it was a free performance.</p>
