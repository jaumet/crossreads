 Mid summer day. It is somewhat warmer than has been the case hitherto. out to sandhills again all morning."It's a poor bum that never rejoices". Meals continue very bad & unappetising. Complaints appear to effect no improvement. Afternoon sandhills again. Wrote to Mrs. Dean during forenoon session.
