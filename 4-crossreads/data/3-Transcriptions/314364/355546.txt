<p>Tues. Feb.11.<br/>Weather continues rough. One chap, named Findlay, got knocked down by a wave yesterday &amp; broke his right arm; &amp; another chap was admitted to Hospital today with a sprained wrist caused by falling on the deck. There are 9 Patients in Isolation &amp; I have 3 to look after in the Gen. Hos. Yank &amp; I went along to the Pantry about midnight to get some Supper but all we got was a cup of Coffee &amp; some Bread &amp; Butter. This was not much good to us to last all night on, so we complained about it. Had a hot Salt water Bath &amp; turned into Bunk where we managed to have a few hours sleep.<br/>The weather is getting warmer &amp; the sea is calming down.<br/>Wed. Feb.12.<br/>Was on night duty again last night with the Yank. Supper was a dismal failure again &amp; Yank said "We're slippin'". I agreed with him &amp; this morning I spoke to the Second Steward about it, who said he would see into the matter.<br/>The weather is quite calm again now &amp; the Diggers are getting their sea-legs".. I agreed with him &amp; this morning I spoke to the Second Steward about it, who said he would see into the matter.<br/>The weather is quite calm again now &amp; the Diggers are getting their sea-legs".<br/>Yank &amp; I got turned out of our Cabin today &amp; had to seek fresh quarters. We passed Gibraltar about midnight last night. It was too dark to see much but we saw "the Rock" looming out of the water &amp; innumerable lights flickering along the coast on either side.</p>
