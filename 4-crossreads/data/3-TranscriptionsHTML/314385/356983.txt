<p>Thur Sep 21st<br/>Still on same duties, we have about 150 patients sick. French flu &amp; boils etc also influenza.</p>
<p>I &amp; another went into Popge in after noon &amp; had a good look round. The people look rough &amp; coarse. Went to a picture show in the evening.</p>
<p>Fri Sep 22nd<br/>Got a half day off and again went into town &amp; found a shop run by Crosse &amp; Blackwell where tinned goods of every description could be obtained from a rump steak to partridge. I invested in a tin of Pork sausages &amp; took it to a resturent &amp; had it warmed. Found them a great relish.</p>
<p>Sat Sep 23rd<br/>Nothing unusual in morning life seems rather flat.</p>
<p>I have many games of chess &amp; Solo whist with the boys. A football match took place in the afternoon between two ambulances which resulted in a conquest by our team.</p>
<p>Flying machines are plentiful.</p>
<p>We had gas helmet drill by our new O.C. he is very keen on this &amp; it seems probable he is preparing us for action</p>
