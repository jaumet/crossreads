  
 we'll be leaving here to-morrow week, but I think its impossible because the men ar'nt good enough & have a lot more to learn & there are no uniforms in sight not half the horses & we have got to spend days on the rifle range teaching men to shoot. 
 This picture of the camp is only a tail end of it We are'nt in the bell tents like this but in ones like this [good small sketch of rectangular tent] Eight of us. 
 I'll give you a plan of how we sleep.

 The Tents are all only 8 by 10 feet so you can imagine the tight fit. The place is full of dust the whole camp is one dust hole. But we dont mind - we are quite happy. We sleep on the hard ground with a waterproof sheet & a blanket only so we are hardened
