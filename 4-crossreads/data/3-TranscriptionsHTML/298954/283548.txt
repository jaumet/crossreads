<p>Sun 18th Nov.<br/>My 21st birthday.   Our table is now divided for special occasions such as this into two halves, and the lower half today held a cheerless sort of celebration.</p>
<p>Being Sunday our dinner consisted of soup, (made from the horses bones.   The same bones have been used over and over again.   One day I was served up a shoulder-blade which had once belonged to some Sydney horse.)   Then came Mrs Crippen unnatural and dried potatoes.</p>
<p>To this was added today beer and lemonade.   Smithy, George, Bob, Jackson, Woods all responded to Lynchs mournful wail "Oh well good health, old man and (tears almost flowing) may it be better next year.</p>
<p>At the other end of the table are McCaughey, old Martin &amp; Richardson;   with whom we have now declared war over an issue of butter or something.</p>
<p>This mess-room of ours now boasts a supply of silver looted from some of the ships.</p>
