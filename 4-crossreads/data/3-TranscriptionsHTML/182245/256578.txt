<p><u>From</u></p>
<p>Sat 7<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;April</p>
<p>fight lasting about quarter of an</p>
<p>hour. One came down safely, with</p>
<p>observer killed &amp; pilot wounded</p>
<p>&amp; the other came down in flames. It</p>
<p>was one of the most terrible sights I</p>
<p>ever want to see to see this thing</p>
<p>coming down in flames &amp; the two</p>
<p>men slowly burning to death. There</p>
<p>was lots of mysterious lights &amp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>sounds all night, &amp; aeroplanes or</p>
<p>air-shIps going about all night.</p>
<p>I had one of the most interesting</p>
<p>times I have ever had today.</p>
