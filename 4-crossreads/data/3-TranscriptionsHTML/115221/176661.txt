<p>A Ward<br/>No. 4 A.G.H.<br/>Randwick<br/>28.4.17</p>
<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>Your letter of 16th inst. only just to hand.  Am very sorry I cannot give you any information as to how Cpl. Gordon was wounded as I was wounded on 24th July &amp; he was all right then.  There are two other 4th Batt. bombers here, Heavey &amp; Hulme both of whom were wounded late on 25th July.  I have spoken to both re your letter &amp; they say Cpl. Gordon was all right when they left.  If you were to write to Sergeant Miller (L/Cpl. J. Miller on card very likely) or Pte. W. Beckett they would very likely be able to give you some information.  They are still I think with the battalion.  Cpl. Gordon was Cpl. of my team &amp; we all liked him very much &amp; I was sorry to hear when in hospital in England <strike>that</strike> from Beckett that Cpl. Gordon had been wounded &amp; had died in hospital.</p>
