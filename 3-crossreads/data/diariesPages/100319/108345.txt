31/8/18 Halle. Peronne
drew up plans for an attack at 5 a.m. tomorrow morning and our Brigade will assault the Northern Suburbs of Peronne. The 24, 21, 23rd attack and we are in reserve. All my men dug into a high chalky bank and I hope to keep them there all night. Sent up a party of volunteer stretcherbearers to the Gottlieb Tr to clear 5th Bde. wounded. 
Roused hell into Sutherland for having returns late at Bde H.Q. The Boche consistently plastered our gully and kept dropping salvoes in it with a monotonous regularity. All these dugouts are on the wrong side and although one is safe enough when right inside the surroundings are dangerous and the doorways are death traps Orders boundaries were altered and 24 23rd were ordered to attack with ourselves 21st in reserve.
