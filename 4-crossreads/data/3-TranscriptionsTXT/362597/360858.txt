the bun before they finished.
I slept up on the front deck this night. All the deck space is covered with canvas now, & although it keeps the sun out it does not keep out the rain. When the rain came down last night everybody scuttled for their quarters. I did not. I got in the alley way on the lee side & it was quite cool & dry.
At this time we are within 5 days sail of the line & we have not had a hot day yet, of course it is hot down in our quarters & stuffy too, but I do not stop there for more than 20 minutes
