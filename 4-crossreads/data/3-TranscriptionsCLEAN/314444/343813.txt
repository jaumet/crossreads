  
 France 8.5.18 
 Dear George 
 I have just received your welcome letter also parcel of Tobacco. for which I am very thankful for. Thanks Mrs Alfonso for posting same & her luck was in as I received the Tobacco alright. 
 Things have been just middling here but I hope by the time you receive this letter that we have got them 'set. As you say George we want men of Brains and I believe it is a thing that the British have missed. 
 No doubt you are reading the papers about the way things are going. 
 The French are a wonderful race besides taking over different parts of the line the populace are sticking to it great
