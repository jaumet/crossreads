  
 could hardly blame him as the day was a "killer." 
 Went up to see Leslie last night   He had just returned from a trip to Cairo & is coming down to dinner with me tonight. He greatly appreciates the change to commissioned rank. Maurice Lenehan is still here. Has been transferred to Colonel Luca's Brigade in the 5th Divn. Was very glad to hear from him that Eric had sufficiently recovered to be coming back. 
 I cannot understand Playfair & Swallow's attitude at all and am much surprised that they did not show a little more courtesy, especially Tommy Swallow as he did not appear to be one of the casual kind.
