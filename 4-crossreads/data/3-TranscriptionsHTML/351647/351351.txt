<p>very joyful reunion.  They want me to go over but I can't get about much, I'm tied here a lot &amp; its so muddy &amp; really its too hard on horses to ride.</p>
<p>Its a ghastly place.  I saw Dr. Lethbridge, he didn't look too well &amp; is having a pretty rough time.</p>
<p>Winter isn't a joyous season of the year at any time &amp; when there is no shelter but dugouts always damp &amp; generally draughty its pretty trying.</p>
<p>Your friends the chilblains threaten me, but I hope they keep off.  I hate wearing things on my head &amp; so of course my ears cop out, they would you know.</p>
<p>Hefty Lasham sent me a cake (her own making) which was jolly good &amp; good of her.  I feel such a pig as I wasn't really so very very nice to her.  I haven't been reading much lately only magazines.  I had a long letter from my pal Tansey, he is well &amp; came through OK.  I was glad as the New Zealanders had a hellish time.</p>
