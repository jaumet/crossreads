<p>14/6/16.<br/>More rain, More wet, a whole week of it. Was working in the "Dead Dog Avenue" trench last night. We always sleep fully dressed; but tonight we are on the "Qui Vive" for some reason or other. There is to be a "strafe" I suppose. The "daylight saving" scheme comes in tonight; it won't effect us much who work at night.<br/>15/6/16<br/>Fritz blew over a little gas attack last night, but it missed our sector. Our "heads" must have known; hence the warning. Our guns were very active, during the night, sending over a protest. Did duty as billet guard, and gas sentry; to warn the company of gas attacks, shells, and other annoyances that the hun is liable to send over anytime. An easy day. Paid 14/-.</p>
