14th Sunday once more, we held a church parade in a heavy snowstorm, right alongside there is a small wood all leafless of course on the trees snow lay thick it looked very pretty with the branches bending over with their white load the flakes falling fast while in the distance could be heard the rumble of traffic on the roads, further off still the muffled roar of heavy artillery such was the conditions peculiar for Australians
which we held our church parade under, happily the padr?e cut it as short as possible no hymns or nothing so she did not last long.
My platoon found the "Guard" tonight if ever there was a rag time one well this was it, we are going to have our work cut out here I
