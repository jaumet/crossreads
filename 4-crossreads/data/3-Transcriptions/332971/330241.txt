<p>Unfortunately my time was pressing and I could only wait to see the one train arrive which brought the Sultan &amp; the notable men folk.  The next train an hour later was to bring the ladies and the body.</p>
<p>During the afternoon the unexpected but secretly wished for came the Telephone.  A message from Matron to say I was to leave E Ward and go to DT "Sister Pigeons"  Of course in many ways I was sorry I had been in # - 4 months &amp; was quite at home there doing eyes ears noses &amp; throats &amp; it meant leaving Sr McMillan, but to go to a Ward that was full of our wounded from the battles was what I wanted &ndash; it meant much harder work, but what a pleasure it is to do for them.  They are such dinkums &amp; the best of the best.  There are 56 in this ward.  The majority have more or less slight wounds but there are some with very bad arms &amp; I think about 16 will be boarded for Australia.  We seem to be doing dressings the whole day long &amp; are so busy that we don't notice how the time goes or realise we are tired until we are off &amp; someone mentions it.  The boys are awfully interested in their bullets.  After they are operated on to have them out we pin them in a little Muslin on to their pillow.  It's the first thin they think of as they come out of the anaesthetic:</p>
