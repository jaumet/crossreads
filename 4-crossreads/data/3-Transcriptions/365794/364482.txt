<p>Thursday 22 March 1917 [21 March 1918]<br/>Again an air raid is thought likely so here I sit 7 p.m. in Connaught ward with all shutters closed &amp; only &frac12; ward lights on.  No fear assails us evidently as it appears to be regarded as a joke all round.<br/>S. Lamb receives marching orders for Pt. Said on Saturday next &amp; how glad she is!  When will ours come I wonder?<br/>Went S. Club 3 p.m. &amp; arranged for motor trip to Pyramids tomorrow 6 p.m.<br/>Sister Hanly returns to Alex today.</p>
