<p>Gallipoli<br/><u>Early November</u> 1915.</p>
<p>My dear Father,<br/>We got our first instalment of battalion comforts to day, &amp; every one is very happy. I'm writing this by candle light in a small but cosy dug-out, which I am shortly going to have enlarged, it is a present about 6ft.6in x 6ft x 5ft 6in high with a dome shaped roof. Everything is very quiet over here now, &amp; I am quite well again. MacCallim is in the field hospital &amp; has been there for the last 5 weeks &amp; I'm afraid he will not be fit to return to duty before he has a change. Its absolutely impossible to pick up here. Evan left the peninsular in a very low state, Blue is still well. I've only seen Caesar 3 or 4 times since we left Australia, &amp; not at all since we left Egypt. Colonel Macnaghton has not returned yet but is doing well. You've asked me to give you the news of the members of my platoon. I haven't had a platoon since I left Egypt &amp; I don't think there are twenty of my original platoon left. My orderley's name is Little, &amp; just returned from hospital Cairo today. I was recommended for my captaincy the day I left for the hospital but it was delayed on account of my absences, I will not lose seniority however &amp; expect it to be out in tomorrows orders. I left Alexandria with an hours notice &amp; so could not do all I wanted to. I had an awful job to get back, in fact the doctor told me I wouldn't last a week, but I've <strike>proved</strike> already proved him a prevaricator &amp; am still as well as ever.<br/>Your affectionate son<br/>Arthur.</p>
