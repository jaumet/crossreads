<p>the day, by nightfall we had nearly 200 prisoners &amp; our booty consisted of 8 guns, (5 big howitzers &amp; 3 field guns) &amp; thousands of shells.  I don't know how many machine guns we captured, but we are using one or two of the best against them &amp; we have I might say thousands of their rifles.   A party from our Battalion marched nearly a 100 of them into Albert, the Tommies nearly went frantic with delight when they heard of the success of the Australians they regard us as marvels, they had failed twice in their attacks on the wood &amp; village &amp; we took it first time, we had a good reputation before but Australia's name stands higher</p>
