<p>1 September 1916</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. John Robertson</p>
<p>After my mail  had been astray for a month, then put into a mud hole to soak for three days, I finally picked it up, slung down with my food in a dirty muddy trench.</p>
<p>Its been raining you see &ndash; nothing is dry, nothing is working, nil to drink except water (?), nothing is right, and really things are beginning to be bright &amp; cheerful, and all is going against the Huns, who in due course will be properly sewn up, and of course we shall soon advance and mop him up.</p>
<p>Note the optimism &ndash; hope ever dormant in human beasts etc., - lovely sentiment.</p>
<p>But I musn't get carried away by my literary talent, to get back to where I started, Mrs. Robertson, the mail has brought me from you.</p>
<p>3 Letters<br/>(What a gala day)!!!<br/>In number (1) you started by saying you were in a bad temper, in (2) &ndash; peevish, (3) &ndash; staid, but in all of them I found you perfectly sweet.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I put on my Sunday 4th gear manners (I haven't got my Sunday suit), stood up to attention, saluted the letters and then read them.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the bad tempered one, you had used more ink than usual in writing, and it had run a bit but it was all read in due course).  How I must stop paying all these</p>
