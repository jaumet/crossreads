 15th October.  Another year gone & I am to-day 31 years. Morning at Military headquarters, where I spent in contracting indents for supplies. Afternoon to Chronicle, where I met Perris & Shackleton. The latter has agreed to pay me the amount due to me in the morning. 
 Met Ozzie Webb who is over on leave, dined together, & afternoon at Australia House. Lieut Smart is giving all attention to the preservation of my negatives, & am pleased to see my pictures are receiving great publicity in the press at present & I am receiving many congratulations. Evening with Webb, & several friends to see "The Boy" at the Adelphi.    It was delightfully funny & a pleasant relaxation.
