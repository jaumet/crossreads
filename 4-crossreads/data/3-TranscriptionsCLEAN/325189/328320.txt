  
 to another table this morning & so done out of our orderly job.  Yesterday our section were vaccinated & inoculated. 
 18th February 1915 Ash Wednesday 
 This is the second Ash Wednesday I have spent upon the high seas.  We were inoculated again to-day.  My arm has quite recovered from the vaccination but there are a lot of beautiful arms about.  I met another chap off the 'Benalla'  - 'Dr. Lowrie'  - a day or two ago.  Have to instruct our sections in semaphore.  We are all fed up with this old tub & every now & again curse it
