 Tuesday 29 On wagon again as No. 4. Rain started about 10 am and were advised a little after 11 to return to camp immediately We returned after resting the horses and we came into camp at a great pace 
 After unharnessing the horses we wheel the wagon to its place in line with others. I was on one wheel  but the others on the  when the wagon swerved my way &amp; went over by toe. I hopped around a bit but walked back to my tent &amp; started to change by clothes which were wet. I had changed shirt &amp; tunic &amp; was removing  by  my boot when I found sock wet with blood. I had the big toe nail nearly squeezed off so reported to the doctor. After having it washed and bandaged I was put to bed so that I would not get it knocked about further. I was very surprised to see the toe hurt like it was especially as I thought  toe  injured toe nails very painful. 
 It is just as well that I can, if I desire, stay in bed as it is very wet &amp; cold at present. So though I suppose I have a sore toe I am doing well and will very shortly be all well again. Spent the remainder of the day in bed having a couple of naps during the afternoon. 
 Wednesday 30th Cold bleak &amp; rainy day. So I thanked my lucky stars &amp; stayed in bed all the morning. I got up in time for dinner &amp; wrote letters.
