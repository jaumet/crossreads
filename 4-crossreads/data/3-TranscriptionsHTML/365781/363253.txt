<p>5th Nov 15<br/>My dearest tic<br/>Your long and interesting letter to hand on 3rd I also rec'd one from Dot and some for Bas one from Dot &amp; Maisie. Your news was real good I am very pleased you took that trip to Newcastle it would brace you up to wait the trouble which you have been long in hearing of. It makes me feel mad sometimes to think you had not been informed for a month and yet you have had the change before being so. I got a letter from George Cooper dated the 12 Aug Wall had not left Lemnos then I am sure he would have gone to England I am expecting a letter from him every mail. Things are going on here the same as ever. Some changes will have taken place by the time</p>
