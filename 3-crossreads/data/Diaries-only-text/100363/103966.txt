Going, however, was bad. The roads were still sticky and treacherous with holes from the recent rains, but in spite of this difficulty we made good time. The good weather was threatening a breakdown which threatening was realised more speedily than anticipated. The rain came down in deluge, flooded the roads and brought the Waddies down gushers. The journey we concluded soaked through, and splashing through a mud sludge, churned up by thousands of hoofs. The transport was held up by their frequently sinking axle deep in the soft ground and the flooded streams.
