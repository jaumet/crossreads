After service Admiral   & staff came into wardroom & quaffed mutual good wishes in champagne. Then they went the rounds of the mess decks, which were not decorated this time. We all hope that next Xmas will be a merrier one. Had a real Xmas tuck in, not forgetting the "pudden". Every man had a pint of beer. Took W.O's piano down to stokers mess deck, where we had enjoyable concert till 3 p.m. Service band played first dog & in the evening had another impromptu show on W.O's flat. Gun room had a fancy dress affair, wh. was exceedingly good. So altogether Xmas passed away cheerfully without a thought for Kaiser Bill. Dec 26.
