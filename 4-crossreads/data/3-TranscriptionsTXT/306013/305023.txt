To the Ocean.
Roll on, thou deep & dark blue Ocean - roll.............Thou glorious mirror where the Almighty's formGlasses itself in tempests;  in all time, -Calm or convulsed, in breeze or gale or storm,Icing the pole, or in the torrid climeDark heaving - boundless, endless & sublime.The image of Eternity; the throneOf the Invisible..........
Thou goest forth, dread, fathomless alone.
Lord Byron.
