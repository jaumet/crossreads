 24/7/18 Aberdeen minutes at Aberdeen but then I could notice that many of the houses were built of the native granite. When it rains these are said to shine and to be more than ordinarily remarkable for beauty. We had Audrey as our carriage mate and looked after her very well. She was still weak after her influenza. Next after Aberdeen came the city of Bonny Dundee and the famous Tay Bridge which is a long low one across the Firth of Tay but nothing like as imposing as the Forth Bridge. We passed low sand-duny country crowded with Glaswegian pleasure seekers out for the trades holidays. After crossing the Tay bridge we got a splendid view of Bonny Dundee with its background of hills and with the sun shining brightly upon it, it certainly was a very bonny place.
