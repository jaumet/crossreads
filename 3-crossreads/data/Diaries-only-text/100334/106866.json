then we were dismissed for the Evening. After having a Shave and a Brush Up and some Tea, I then caught a Bus out to Harringay to see a Friend say Good Bye. As I was not expected I naturally gave her a surprise, anyhow we went for a walk into Finsbury Park and spent the evening chatting and watching the Boys flying their Kites, until 10 Pm when I came back with my Friend and bade her Good Bye until I am fortunate to manage another Trip to England. I returned by Bus to the Club and after Supper I turned in for the Night sleeping in a large Dormitory containing 500 Bed's which were nearly all occupied by Australians on Leave.
