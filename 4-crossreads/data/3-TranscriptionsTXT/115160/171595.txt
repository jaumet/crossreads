 Thanks for the photo. &nbsp;Are all the girls there employees of the Town Hall? I see you occupy a good position, and sure you will have plenty to do as Hon Sec. But to what are you turning your hands, now that there is no further use for your good offices?

 Very pleased to note Dad is back at work again. &nbsp;I hope he has completely got over his bad spell and is quite strong again.

 Fondest regards from your loving brother
