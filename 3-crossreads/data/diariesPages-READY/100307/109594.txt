"B" Camp Mametz
27/3/17
bare places cold and empty. No fuel or food. YMCA sent over tea and biscuits and after batmen and valises arrived things became more comfortable. Went round to all the companies and found them more or less comfortable. The men have had rather a heavy day and owing to hurried move, have had to go on rather slight rations ? no hot meal. Roused about this because it was possible to have prepared a meal had the cooks put their minds to it. But they do not do their best and always raise a cry of not possible" unless they are told they have to damn well do it.

In Mametz huts. Cleaning up issue of dinkum Aust hats and clothing the QM had fortunately secured. Established mess with Alderson as Secretary and had fine dinner in the evening. Drank the health of the new mess I then delivered a lecture on "Mess Etiquette Manners" ? a subject on which some of our junior subs. need much teaching.
