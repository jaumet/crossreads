<p>Thursday 2nd November<br/>Rain &amp; still more rain, mud &amp; still more mud.  Went to look for a canteen &amp; got lost in a sea of mud.  As far as I could see was mud, feet deep in some places &amp; yet horses were picketed out in it &amp; men had to work in it men horses &amp; harness &amp; wagons were enveloped in it.  Had a look at Becourt &amp; Fricourt again &amp; came on some of the graves of those killed in the first advance.  They were buried in shell holes numbers according to size of hole, in one were 30 another 15 &amp; so on.  Wednesday night we had a visit from some Taubes who dropped several bombs 5 of which burst in rapid succession, casualties were few however. Fires were put out &amp; lights quenched &amp; the searchlights got to work with the guns but with no results.  On the whole things are quiet, the line being held while the artillery do the strafing.</p>
<p>Saturday 4th Nov<br/>Last two days fine but cold with rain during the night.  Went for drugs to "Corbie" about 15 miles away also took patients to the C.R.S.  "Corbie" is quite a decent place with a good number of French soldiers as well as our own.  Had tea there &amp; did some shopping arriving back about 9 P.M.  Roads breaking up alot &amp; large gangs of Germans were employed on them.  The huns bombarded our headquarters today &amp; played up with things.  How they learn the position is wonderful &amp; then to score hits at about 12 miles range seeing that very few taubes ever come over.  During the day aerial</p>
