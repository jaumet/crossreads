  
 Feb 2nd The rain is over & we have had a few perfect days but tonight a gusty wind is blowing a hurricane  I am afraid my home will not stand it. I am afraid we are in for the usual monthly wind which generally lasts three days.

 I am still here eating Lotos off a tin plate & having a very quiet if hardly hilarious time. 
 My day is usually spent thuswise
