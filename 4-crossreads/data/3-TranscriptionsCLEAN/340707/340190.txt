  
 memory of those who have not returned from the war but whose memory this city places above all else on this day of rejoicing. The statue is only of wood & plaster but the entire city files past it in a silence that is heartrending. 
 The amount of black in the crowd & the homage paid to it no matter what the condition in life of the person is a tribute of never dying gratitudes to one who has lost some dear one for their liberty The spirit of [indecipherable] is entirely absent in this vast crowd which has come to pay its homage to the immortal & nameless dead. 
 This spirit of sadness seems to tinge all the festivities. Whether the losses are in every family or whether the cenotaph looming at top of Av.[Champs Elysee is an ever silent reminder I know not but there is a sadness here which later in England I failed to detect. 
 The tubes are packed & it took us nearly 1/2 hour to get on to the station & in the train - well ordinary trains are packed but to night sardines are not more tightly packed & the hot smell of the tube & the body smell of the crowd some of whom are country people is not the incense breath of Morn.
