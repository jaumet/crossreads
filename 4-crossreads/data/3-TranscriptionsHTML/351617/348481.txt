<p>Another Instance happened near Bapaume when a Fritz drove one of our boys down and crashed him in the shell holes. As he passed over the Fritz threw out a small bottle of Iodine and some bandages. And so they had treated these two at Solre Le Chateau to a decent buriel and at their heads was a big white Wooden-Cross and on a copper plate was the date of their death and their names</p>
<p>And as soon as Christmas was over the boys began to get a move on towards home &amp; one by one their names began to come out on the drafts for home. Sid Pace and Billy Lickiss Sam Charles Les Ellis and all the old boys went one by one and we watched for the day when ours would go up.</p>
<p>Long Joe Waterworth and Charlie Ekberg used to keep the boys alive with their songs and recitations on the long winter nights and theres no doubt about it "Long Joe" as the boys called him could</p>
