  
 We are still uncertain of our movements;   no one seems to have any definite information to offer as to when or where we go.   The air is of course thick with rumours, but I do not pay much heed to anything unofficial.   I have just purchased a helmet & find it a great protection from the sun.   I don't think the Luxor trip could be done without a helmet.   The mosquitoes are just eating me up in spite of tobacco smoke & the smoke from a heap of gum leaves that I have been burning in the tent (we have gums galore here) so I must end up this epistle & crawl; in under the shelter of your indispensable mosquito nets.   Au revoir old girl with best love to all & hoping you are all happy & well, Yr loving husband Will. I enclose photos of two of the Cairo mosques. W.H.R.
