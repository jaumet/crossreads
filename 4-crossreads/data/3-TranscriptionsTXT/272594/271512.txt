trenches with 2 men & myself the portion of trench I was in was mostly 5th Bde & they had the wind up properly as they had lost heavily as the numerous dead lying about showed all too plainly, when we were taking over old Fritz made a counter attack but he was beaten off. I'm hanged if I know where were until day broke for shells seemed to be coming from all sides & flares were going up practically all round us it seemed very queer.
