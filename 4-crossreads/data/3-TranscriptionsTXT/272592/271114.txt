& etc.   I saw the officer in charge & he got the cooks to boil us a dixie of tea for dinner.
15th.   It appears this job we are on lasts while the Brigade is in reserve & we have to sleep & tucker over here, we did not bring our blankets or packs with us so when the work was finished I asked the officer in charge for the loan of one of the motor lorries to run us round to our Camp to get our things so he lent us one & we slipped round had our tea got paid & packed up & back we come it was raining pretty heavily too but we were right for once & under cover, so we will be here for a day or two doing fatigues
