Thursday 30 [29] August 1917 [1918]Col. Fetherston [Featherstone] visits 31st & inspects Sisters in their quarters - promises perhaps 3 wks. leave in England!  I, while waiting for Brid. Gen. Onslow, encounter Miss Gemmell in hall.  Soundly attacked on my attire.  "Must not wear white frocks" etc.  On returning from lovely drive to Mardi she practically takes it all back & grants permission to wear them!  Never have I been addressed in such a manner as this lady uses.  Marliesh!4 p.m. tea Shepheard's & am asked to become mascot for B. Gen. Onslow's new brigade.
