<p>11.3.16<br/>A chap passed me on the stairs last night and as he passed he said "If I'm not better tomorrow I hope to Christ I'm dead &amp; that's just how I felt at the time.</p>
<p>12.3.16 Sunday<br/>Sea Sickness seems to be leaving me now.  I have already had two good meals. Mess orderly today.  A man fell down the hatch this morning &amp; broke his collar bone.  We have had splendid weather so far.  No chance of getting exercise here we are packed like sardines.</p>
<p>13.3.16  Monday<br/>Among the Coo ees there is a chap with a voice like Will Oaklands, he is a lovely singer.  The man who fell down the hatch is pretty bad suffering from internal injuries he never wasted  any time</p>
