<p>12 &ndash; pretty gran &ndash; she has always been so loving to me. I tell the girls to read her my letters &ndash; but I'm afraid she can't write to me herself &ndash; they tell me she is so weak. I am afraid you will be just eaten up with anxiety precious Mother. I hope Jocelyn will go out to be with you early this year. You should not be without a daughter when you have so many. I know you want us all to do all we can for our era or what ever you call it, but you are a very important part of it. I hope Dad is well. How I long to see you both. Don't do house work Mother darling. I can't bear to think of you slaving. Much better not to leave us any pennies than for you to work. Isn't it a hateful war. There seems no prospect of peace yet. Devoted love my heavenly Mum &ndash; to both you and Dad<br/>Your devoted daughter<br/>Betha McMillan</p>
