Abdul put out some wire and pulled in his firing line a bit in one place last night. Rumours of big moves on mainland and in the West. Quiet day but busy with returns. It has been cold. Up to present I have worn shorts and bear knees but nevermore while this snap continues. 
During after noon with Curnow went to B8 secret m g post and searched the Turks trenches with telescope. Really their work is 
wonderful, the trenches are fortifications we will never shift them from with anything but the bayonet and a force about doubled. Trenches covering the hills and in some cases going back hundreds hundreds of yards. Through telescope could see them moving about one chap walking along trench quietly dressed in grey overcoat, two others chatting and some more using a crosscut saw.
Thurlow, the Kings prizeman lying in his snipers nest with telescopic rifle, telescope c watching them waiting his chance for a kill. Tried a shot or two at 1500 yards but the strong wind spoilt his shooting. He roams round all day waiting a chance and generally gets a couple of "kills" at least per day. Nothing doing in evening. Abdul has some fine entanglements out, trestles facing Lone Pine ? a very real obstacle to an advance. All the A Co lads growing beards making it very hard to recognise them. Lovely sunset. Bed 2053. A wintry icy day
