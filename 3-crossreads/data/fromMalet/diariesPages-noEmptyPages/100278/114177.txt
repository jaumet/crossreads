the "cookers pulled out. I had charge of the baggage guard which consisted of 12 men so we had to look alive and get packed up.
I don't know how many kilometres we travelled today a fair number for we were on the move pretty constantly from 7.30 till 2 o'clock in the afternoon they were pulled in at a dirty little village ("La Houssaye") one village we passed through today was a pattern of cleanliness the streets were as clean as a newly swept floor and the houses were nice and trim everything looked so nice. I expect seeing as how Army Hqr's are here accounts for it the majority of the sentries were mounted and everything done in style.
Passed a lot more Germans road-making and some of them looked very young.
