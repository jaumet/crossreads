<p>August 1916<br/>Once in the days of long ago,<br/>Days &ndash; of my whole life the best &ndash;<br/>When the time for sleep had come,<br/>And the house was hushed to rest,<br/>It was such a happy thought,<br/>Used to make my heart so light,<br/>We were all beneath one roof<br/>When I barred the door at night.</p>
<p>Let the wind moan as it would,<br/>Let the rain-drops patter fast,<br/>They were near me, nestled warm<br/>From the midnight, &amp; the blast;<br/>Not one lingering out of reach,<br/>Not one banished far aloof -<br/>It's a woman's heaven to have<br/>All she loves beneath one roof.</p>
<p>Now, when bedtime comes at length<br/>To me, sitting here alone;<br/>And the ticking of the clock<br/>Tells how still the house has grown,<br/>Oh, how heavy is the heart<br/>That was once so light of yore;<br/>Now &ndash; I seem to bar them out<br/>When at night I bar the door.</p>
