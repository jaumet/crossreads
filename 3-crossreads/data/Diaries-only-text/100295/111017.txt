5th September 
Remained in Camp all day, except for a short trip to Cassel to see the Censor. Harrison is an excellent fellow I have set him to building a small kitchen. Harvey is doing the cooking and he does it well. Martin I have placed in the darkroom to look out after printing titling. Wilkins will attend to the records I myself to publicity pictures aesthetic results. Collectively we are a contented little unit; absolutely isolated at Steenvorde  a mile from the town. We are in immediate touch with all fronts. 
Cassel, where are the General Headquarters is a fine little town, built on the crest of a lofty hill, which overlooks the surrounding lands of agriculture. Like all other roads, in Nth France. The ways to Cassel are lined with stately poplars other trees.
