 I never saw so mani star in the sky for a long while as there was last night , the " Milki Way " was like a jewel shop , yet even so it did not guarante the night be fine for earli this morn we were driven hastili downstair by a heavi shower which near drench us . You can never depend on the night here it seem for storm spring up so sudden without a trace of warn . " Order " came out yesterday ( 30th ) to the effect that no one was allow to leav the boat at Colombo without permiss , I am think that if they do n't let the men ashor there , troubl will be in store for some one . Life on ship is go veri slow now We have n't sight a ship sinc the 20th . noth but the sea wherev you look .
