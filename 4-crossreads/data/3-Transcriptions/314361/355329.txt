<p>by an equal number, every three months, to exploit the quarries of the Arabian hills, to transport the blocks to the site, to construct the Causeway, a work which lasted ten years, the pyramid was buildt, step by step, by means of wide lines made of "short pieces of wood" which were equal in number to the teirs of stone on which were moved from teir to teir as each stone was taken up.<br/>The Pyramid of Cheops is the most northernly one. Its dimensions are as follows. &ndash;<br/>Vertical height 450 ft.; width of sides at the base 750 ft height of the face measured on an inclined plane 567 ft. Owing to the complete removal of the outer casing, its base has the appearance of an irregular step or ledge. The summit is a square platform about 35 ft. square, originally rather less than 10ft. The agglomeration of stone there massed together has been estimated at 2,801,000 sq. yards &amp; now reduced to 2,613,000 sq. yards. The name of this pyramid was Akhut Khufu.
