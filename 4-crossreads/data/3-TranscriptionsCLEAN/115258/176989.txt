 My deat Mother, 
 A big mail came in yesterday and I got seven letters, all told from home so I'll start one in reply now. We have had a pretty exciting time all last week, although t  it really has been tame compared  to  with the Beersheba push. I am writing this from Ammon. We have cleared up all the turks round this side and it will take the mob some time to get up to the other front; so as I have been a bit off colour the last few days they have sent me back for a spell while they move round. So I'm now in the C.C.S. Ammon and marked " Debility" and I can tell you its the right horse to back alright. i came from bully and biscuits unending and first meal here was chicken,  bis  megina, sweet biscuits and bread and jam! Think they can keep it up?
