you ask how I like Egypt its would be a very nice place to tour in, there are ten thousand wonderful &amp; strange sight to see in this old time country.
but to live here would be no good to me. theres to much sand &amp; not enough rain, which reminds me a lovely shower fell last night or this morning the first real rain I have seen this side the line, I don't like the natives extra, some of them are interesting then they become a nuisance. The educated among them are different.
Am glad H. has got a job a meant to write to him but can't just yet. may get a chance later on If we are still here thank B for her letter
