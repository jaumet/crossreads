<p>Sometimes I feel sorry that I didn't give Laurel her wish but still Sis I'm not home yet  &amp; one never knows. Give little  <strike>Miss</strike> Noni a heap of kisses for me  &amp; tell her, her silly old uncle is playing soldiers again somewhere on the map. Give kindest regards to Vol's people  &amp; tons of love  &amp; kisses for yourself. You ought to have had quite a number of letters  &amp; cards from me by now because if I don't feel in the humor to write letters I send cards. Once again good-bye  &amp; good luck  &amp; best wishes for all your welfare  &amp; happiness from your Brother Hal.</p>
