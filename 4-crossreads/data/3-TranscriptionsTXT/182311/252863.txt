intend to know the place pretty well before I leave it.
   About forty officers live here, they are all sorts, shapes, and sizes and styles, from many different units, and all have had some fine experiences, we get together in the ante-room after Mess, sing a little, dance a little and yarn, some play cards but cards bore me.
   Sunday is a free day here, so I must plan some expedition into the country or along the coast, weather permitting.
   I have just come down from the anteroom, where, after dinner we have had quite a cheery sing-song. (I broke off at page three at 7-15 for dinner).  Harris has been playing all the latest, Yack-a-Hooley - Kiss Trot - Every Little Girl, etc., and we have even taken men-partners and danced around the room.
   Tomorrow I'll go down to Havre after parade and enjoy some of the luxuries of civilization, to wit, a haircut, shampoo and a hot bath, it will be grand; the biggest charm of the life here is that now we live more or less as gentlemen can lay out our clothes, change after parade and keep our kit on shelves and not hunt for it through the miscellaneous oddments that fill the kit bag and valise.
   This must be all for the present,
      Best wishes from
         Harold.
