August, 1915Sunday 1Here we are on board the Knight Templar 1500 of us packed anyhow. Men just throw themselves down anywhere I have nothing but what I stand up in, but all is well -Saw Cuth Fetherston for a minute last night at a riot in the slums of Cairo the soldiers burnt 5 houses 6 stories high & smashed up 6 others. We call it the battle of the WAZZA.
