4 Monday4 squads out of A Section & B Section fell in 6 am & entrained at Longueval for Dernancourt & from Dernancourt we marched to the Anzac Rest station just out of Buire a distance I suppose of about three miles.  It is a beautiful clear day but there is rather a sharp wind blowing.  The rest of the Ambulance went up to Delville wood.  The 3rd Fld Amb. are looking after the Rest station here. had a good bath this evening, it was needed very much.
5 TuesdayRaining during the day, just about enough to make the ground muddy.  Detailed as clerk in the admittance tent.  There was nothing much to do after we got rid of a very big sick parade.  There were sounds as of a big bombardment on the right.  This place has been condemned & has to be evacuated completely by Saturday next. Received 2 letters, the first to be addressed to this unit from Australia.
6 WednesdayReveille goes at 6.30 here, but as all of us have been used to getting up at 8 am, we have never attended the 7 am parade this two mornings.  The 1st Fld is in charge of this place now.  Relieved about 10 am. packed up & left here 1.30 pm for Ribemont about 2 kilometres away.  Both my heels are blistered & it is a struggle to keep on walking.  My cold is getting very bad, hadn't much sleep during the night through coughing.
