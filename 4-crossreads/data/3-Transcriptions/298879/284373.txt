<p>May 1915<br/>Monday 10<br/><u>Dull</u> Few drops of rain. Came off duty this morning about 5 AM. Our artillery stirred up the Turk again &amp; they replied wounding some more of our fellows. We are waiting for more guns to come up before towelling them up. Our platoon resting today. Fifteen of our plat. ordered to go out and make a road for guns. I missed that job. Had the best night' rest since landing</p>
<p>Tuesday 11<br/><u>Dull</u> Enemy very quiet with his artillery but rouses up with rifle fire at night time. We scarcely fire a shot. I think they are nervous fearing an attack from us. Our <strike>patrol</strike> Bu. sends out patrols every night for reconnaissance.  They returned one man short last night.  Engineers also go out to throw grenades and guncotton into the Turkish Trenches</p>
