 Three of us had walking sticks &amp; did our march forward in great spirits, passing &amp; being passed by transport of every description pack horses &amp; mules all bent on the same mission but no sign of any disorder or bustle. Each little unit or section moving on with a definite plan, we stopped that night at the' tunnel' a huge system of dugouts in which we had a station alongside 'Flers' &amp; plans were at once laid to open up in 'Bapaume' itself, the dream of us all. I was not among the fortunate ones to go, my turn I hope coming tomorrow. We had some cavalry casualties through, Indian &amp; our own, these being the first we had handled &amp; a good sign of our progress. During the afternoon not a shot of any description could be heard absolutely peaceful &amp; we hear that the country the other side of Bapaume is quiet, the roads good, the whole countryside appearing to be untouched by war.
