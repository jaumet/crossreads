<p>As there was a likelihood of my leaving immediately, &amp; not having seen Dad while on leave, through a misunderstanding, I advised them to come down to Parkhouse for a week end.  They came, &amp; in the end all went well, although there was an initial difficulty about getting lodgings for them, &amp; a later one on Sunday morning of getting leave myself, since I had been put on draft.<br/>By the aid of the adjudant the latter was fixed up &amp; good digs were got near Tidworth with a Mrs [indecipherable].<br/>The three of us with Sgt Clerke went to a vaudeville show at the Garrison Theatre</p>
