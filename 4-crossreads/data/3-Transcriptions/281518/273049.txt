<p>1/9/16<br/>Glasgow. a great day. Pottered round all the morning and at 2pm went up to the Windsor Hotel to Skene's wedding. There were a good many guests and everything went off like clockwork. It was a homely little wedding and afterwards "the younger ones" adjourned to the Central for tea and afterwards went to the Ahlambra music hall until 9 o'clock. Skene's sister in law tres bon and also a little first year med girl. Spent a grand evening with them and really have never listened to anything so pretty as their Scotch accent. They twit us about our Cockney one. Out to Newlands for supper and some music and it was grand to get with a family again. All so homely and so Scotch. Bed 12 mid.</p>
<p>2/9/16<br/>Rothesay, Kyles of Bute &amp; Oban. Left Glasgow early and took train for Wemyss Bay changing there for a steamer to Ardrishaig. To Rothesay and round the top of Bute. The Kyles of Bute have exquisite scenery especially at [indecipherable] which is a heavenly little spot. Plenty of holiday makers aboard &amp; they nearly all went off here.</p>
