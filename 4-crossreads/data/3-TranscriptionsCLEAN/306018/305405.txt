February 1917& then went for a swim.   The water was fairly cold.  At 11 oclock attended the sick camel parade & watched them all treated.  They are dirty creatures to handle & I don't think it is possible for anyone to like them  The Brigade went out early in the morning as a covering party to a vessel taking soundings on the coast.  Am picking up a bit of Arabic & often have little yarns with the nigs.  It is the only way to learn.
Monday 26thIn the morning went with the sick parade & later went over to the Regiment.  There were 3 mines exploded that were washed ashore  It was a good sight to see them go off.  A Taube came over in the morning.  An Australian mail arrived.  I only received 1 letter from home.
Tuesday 27thHad nothing to do all day.  The Brigade was out on reconnaissance & saw some mounted Turks.  Some gift stuff arrived & was distributed & was very acceptable no canteen being yet out here
