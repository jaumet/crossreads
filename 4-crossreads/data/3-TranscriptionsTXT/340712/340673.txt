AN OLD BARN,SOMEWHERE IN PRANCE.20th May, 1916.It sounds strange to hear all your references to Egypt, for we have been here so long now and have so thoroughly left Egypt and all that atmosphere so characteristic of it, behind, that it seems a journey of years to go back to it.I don't suppose I will be fortunate enough to meet with Will Reed this side of the globe. I am separated from all my pals&#151;-the unfortunate fate of reinforcements, and I am a fraid that his party will be scattered to the four winds of heaven.&nbsp;It seemed strange at first to put colours on one's arm similar to those that distinguish all the "returned&#148; in Australia. We were ordered to wear them on joining our Brigade in Egypt. It seems they were only waiting for us, so I was lucky to be in the party I left with, rather than the next.&nbsp;It seems a pity, but all the clothing we receive now is " Tommyw stuff. Slop made; and black, clumsy boots; you see we are now in the Imperial Army.&nbsp;Though we are at the front thejff authorities are still punctilious about shaving and clean boots and leggings. We are inspected (that is the Officer looks at each man individually) each morning at 9 a.m.&nbsp;This is an ordinary day's programme:Reveille 5.15 a.m., fall in 5.45 a.m.,Exercising horses till 7 a.m., feeding,etc, till 7.30 a.m.Breakfast 8 a.m. Boot and saddle 8.30 a.m.,Fall in 9 a.m., then file out for drill with AmmunitionWagons.
