  
 [Newspaper cutting from the Evening News] "The Red Devil" Australians in the Air Features of Anzac Day London, Sunday Evening 
 The most striking feature of the Anzac Day celebrations was hair-raising stunts by Australian airmen, particularly on a Sopwith machine which was promptly christened "the Red Devil." 
 It travelled at a terrible speed, looped and nosedived almost among the chimney pots, and seemed in imminent danger of entangling itself among the telephone wires or crashing on a steeple. The daring feats caused many women to scream. 
 There was a remarkable demonstration after the procession passed Australia House. Australians among the spectators swarmed in from everywhere and pushed the police easily aside. They gathered round the dais, cheering the Prince of Wales and Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig. They demanded that the Prince should shake hands. He never had a more cordial reception. 
 Senator Pearce's Promise 
 Mr. Hughes, Sir Joseph Cook, and Senator Pearce, in speeches from the stage of His Majesty's Theatre, paid a tribute to the heroism of the Aussies. 
 Senator Pearce also promised the men something more substantial than hand-clapping when they returned to Australia. 
 Mr Hughes, dealing with the problems of reconstruction, said he was delighted to see the way Australian soldiers dealt with the Bolsheviks in Brisbane. 
 The Australian Y.M.C.A. held Anzac Day memorial services at the Aldwych Theatre. 
 Bishop Frodsham conducted an Anzac memorial service at Gloucester Cathedral.
