 Since I last wrote a few changes have happened &ndash; I asked to be relieved of the charge of the camp in order to do some medical work for a change &ndash; Major Carter took my place down here &amp; I took over some of the beds at Mena House but still continued to live on the flat -   I could have had a luxurious room at the house but somehow or other I like the tent best besides I think it is healthier &amp; it is only a 200 yard walk up to the House where I get a nice hot bath every morning after reveille, and we mess very decently down here now &ndash; we have given up the nigger contractor who was dirty &amp; dear &amp; now run our own mess &amp; live practically on our rations.   Well Major Carter has just been detailed off to a special duty &amp; I am once more at the helm down here in addition to having the wards at the House, but there is not a great deal to do at either place &amp; time passes pretty slowly.    We are still living in glorious uncertainty as to our movements but must know something definite before very long.   I fancy our hospital will remain in Egypt for a good while &ndash; we may be stationed in Alexandria.   I have just had the trunk that I left to be stored at Cook's in Cairo brought back to camp.   What a splendid idea of your Aunt Elizabeth's &ndash; I will remember it.
