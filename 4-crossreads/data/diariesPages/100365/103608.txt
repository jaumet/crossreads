the place to pieces the firing could be heard from here quite plainly. At first we thought that the Enemy were attacking our positions. As retaliation this morning a couple of their aeroplanes bombed Port Said, which is about 4 hours up the Canal from here killed several natives besides wounding 5 soldiers. They were quickly chased off however, by our planes, before they could do much damage.There was a very picturesque sight this morning occasioned by an immense Camel Train passing through here from their desert quarters.The Camel Train was a couple of miles long consisted of some very fine Camels. It was an Indian Train the Indian Troops cheered us a treat as they went by. The Bikanier of India was among them with his crack fighting Corps consisting of 500 fully trained Sikhs gigantic Bull camels. They looked a treat. Nearly everyone of them had their Hookah it was funny to see them perched up on a camel, complacently smoking as they jogged along.This morning brought good news as it is reported that the Russians have now joined up forces with the British in Mesopotamia so we will look for happenings of a bright nature in the next few weeks.
