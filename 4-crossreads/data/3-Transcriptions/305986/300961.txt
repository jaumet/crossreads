<p>"The Comparison"</p>
<p>The Knights of old went to the fight<br/>Arrayed in shining armour<br/>Reflecting back the sunshine bright<br/>And smiled on by fair charmer<br/>Who sent her hero on to dare<br/>Some deed of knightly duty<br/>In open Air and forest fair<br/>All clothed in Verdant beauty</p>
<p>No shining armour can array<br/>The warriors of "Wipers"<br/>Unless they want to fall a prey<br/>To lurking German Snipers<br/>No glittering steel from head to heel<br/>But Flanders mud attires them<br/>Like Mice and Moles they darkly steal<br/>Whatever war requires them.</p>
