<p>have the happy knack of just sending what is most needed.  I haven't had a chance of seeing Mr. Budden but he seems to be doing good work.  I was expecting to be losing some of my Officers, to help with the new Division being formed at Cairo, I had to send in the names of 1 officer for Bn. Command &amp; 3 for Compy Comd., but up to the present I have not been drawn on, &amp; I hope I won't, as the losses at Gallipoli, the killed &amp; wounded &amp; sick have left me with a lot of vacancies to fill from the Ranks.  We all felt the death of Majors Jenkins, Harcus &amp; Uther very keenly, they were all such fine men, &amp; their places were hard to fill.  I had recommended Uther for the Legion of Honour decoration about a week previous to his being killed.  With kind regards to Mrs Fergusson &amp; yrself,</p>
<p>Yrs sincerely<br/>J. Lamrock.</p>
