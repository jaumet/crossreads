<p>30th<br/>I had a look at the pictures in the Royal Scotland Academy Exhibition.</p>
<p>This evening I went to see the Woman of no Importance one of Oscar Wilde's plays.  It was cleverly played.</p>
<p>31st<br/>Went out to the Castle again today, had tea at Bobbie Bovis Hotel where I saw two of the "third sex" and had a long ramble along Scott's glen a beautiful glen too.  Reminded me a good deal of my rambles along the Broken Back Range out Rothbury way.</p>
