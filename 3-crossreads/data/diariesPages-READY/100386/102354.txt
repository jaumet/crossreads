Before dispensing with the services of the 5th Australian Field Bakery, I should like to put on record my appreciation of the very excellent work done here by Lieutenant Pye and his men. In spite of great heat, sickness and difficulties with the wood, this Bakery has always turned out good Bread in quantities which have been considerably above the average for a single Bakery.
After experience of the bakeries at Helles and Mudros, I cannot pay the 5th a greater compliment than by saying that it has done all that I could have expected from such bakeries as the 10th and 13th which I was fortunate enough to have attached to my Depot at Mudros West.
