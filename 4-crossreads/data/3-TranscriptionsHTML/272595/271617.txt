<p>29th.   Thank Heaven I feel a tiny bit better today but my cough is still very bad, &amp; at present I have very little interest in life, I know I would make a very bad patient if it should ever be my misfortune to have a long illness stopping in bed breaks my heart, &amp; oh the horrible &amp; rotten medicines we have to swallow, almost as soon drink poison<br/>30th.   A little better again today but still have a headache &amp; feel weak its spreading like wildfire all over this part of the world according to the papers<br/>1st July. Frightfully hot weather &amp; everyone nearly dead myself included sweat all day &amp; night, &amp; soon will be like a matchstick.<br/>A big batch of men left here for Australia last night, nearly all had lost limbs or something</p>
