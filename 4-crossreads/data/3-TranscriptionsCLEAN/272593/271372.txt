  
 but we did not stay long for it rained fairly heavy, so we were dismissed & had to carry on with "machine gun instruction" in the huts. There has been a lot of rivalry lately between A. & C Coy. over their platoon drilling & etc so this morning each platoon selected their 6 best men & they were put in a "special squad" & they shaped real well, so there is a promise of a competition coming off. A few of us went over to the Y.M.C.A. hut tonight to see Charlie Chaplin & a concert which was being run by Old Mac. What a man  he is a man can't give him too much praise  absolutely the finest man in the Division
