<p>A rather dull day. Remained indoors all the morning having a fine boil on the right cheek. Did not go out until afternoon. Rambled about until twilight. Spent the evening indoors.</p>

<p>Still in bed. Winter coming on fast and the air full of falling leaves. Today at 3 pm I was to have kept a rendezvous at Villers Bocage but it must wait until later. Things very quiet in the Brigade and no news of interest to chronicle. Very little sun these days and a lot of gloomy weather.</p>
