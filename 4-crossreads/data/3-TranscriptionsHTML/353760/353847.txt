<p>February 11<br/>154.<br/>Not a damned suggestion of a reply of a book from T.B.C., feel inclined to write them cancelling all unfulfilled orders and suggesting a less blatantly hollow ending to their damned polite notes.  If T.L.S. doesn't arrive tomorrow will write to them.</p>
<p>155.<br/>This morning on the road to Bailleul a small batch of Boche prisoners newly captured, between 30 and 40 in all &ndash; young boys and young men, one lad of not more than 16, a lovely boy of soft golden colouring, tired expressioned, a great ugly grey helmet weighing his head.  Some of the unit walked casually down to the road to watch them, and incidently to enquire of the A.P.C. guard if they were responsible for the bug.  I should like to fully realise &ndash; not by experience though &ndash; the inner feelings of that golden land.</p>
<p>156.<br/>A Realisation!  Tonight 30 copies printed of Pages 1 &amp; 8 of "Gheitz" and a commencing of pages 2 and 7.</p>
<p>February 13, 14<br/>157.<br/>This morning "Gheitz" published &ndash; and the 20 copies for sale sold before 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Tonight I read awhile in the Rec. Hut, Mais' "Shakespeare to O. Henry", Richard Middleton's The Paragraph on page 225 of the book of a great author applies almost to the unit's reception of "Gheitz".</p>
<p>Now outside Rec. Hut we've a cigar box for contributions, notices up existing notes &amp; insults.</p>
<p>Afternoon:  with Basil B. to Bailleul seeking stuff for "Bal Masque" of Friday.</p>
<p>Mail today &ndash; T.B.C. invoice of books of entry 113, and yesterday Max Beerbohm's "More" &ndash; 6/-, Beaumont's cataloguing 15/-, no T.L.S.  No "To-Day" yet.</p>
<p>February 14<br/>158.<br/>The same dull day:  but mail brought with it from T.B.C. Masefield's "The Old Front Line" &ndash; the 1st impression and its already in its 20th Thousand.  "The Vengeance of Fionn", from Maunsel, and "Appreciation and Depreciation", a book of Theo Talbot since and well printed and of pleasantly designed format.  Tonight I'll read "The Old Front Line".</p>
