  
 29/4/19 Wiesbaden Spring day. On my trip I have indeed been lucky with the weather. Went to the Opera "Die Judin" (The Jewess?") at 6.30pm. It was very good indeed. In the intervals all the audience promenade and eat. Remark - the number of bald men, the number of men with shaven or close cropped heads and the number who have heads peculiarly shaped. The girls are not blondes as one might be excused for expecting but they are rather light brunettes. Their clothes are neat and there is nothing daring about their evening toilettes. The "chic" touch of La Petite Parisienne is absent. There is no make up. At the Opera the bouquets to the singers took the form of boughs of fruit blossom - all the trees are now in bloom. To the Cercle des Officiers at 10 pm for dinner and wined well before writing this.
