<p>WAR MEMORIAL COMES TO SYDNEY</p>
<p>[See image for photograph]</p>
<p>The scene is Bullecourt, World War I.  Tanks have already tried to break through the German wire, but have failed.  Now the 4th Australian Division is attempting an impossible job.</p>
<p>This is one of the many displays which some 250,000 Australians see in the Australian War Memorial at Canberra each year.</p>
<p>But many thousands of other Australians are not able to visit Canberra.  So now the memorial, on film, is coming to them.</p>
<p>The Memorial authorities will show a two and a half hour film programme at Sydney Town Hall on February 21 and 22 at 8 p.m.  It will include "The Australian War Memorial", an excellent colour film produced recently by the Commonwealth Film Unit.</p>
