Our 12 15" Guns all around were blazing away at Fritz, it is was like the old saying (Cannons to Right, Cannons to the left in fact Cannons were all around us, what a terrific noise, you could hear the 15" when they fired they gave a double bang the 12" a single bang. As Fritz was sending heavy stuff over, our Guns were warming up to the engagement, as the 12" were fired I could see long tongues of Flame belching forth in their Anger, it was a glorious Sight although terrible, every time a 15" would fire my Engine would tremble (No 3092). The Patrol party had a job to do as the line behind the Big Gun had been blown up by Fritz at 6 am in the morning, it was a very close call for all hands, the Shell exploding about 20 ft behind the concussion knocked the gunners over but did not hurt anyone. It took 40" to unload the truck as it was getting to hot around about, we were ordered to clear out to Reigersberg
