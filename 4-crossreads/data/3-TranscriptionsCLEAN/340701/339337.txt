  
 fiddle is a splendid player.  I met Joe Sellars here he is in the 2nd Battalion.  This sea sickness is hanging on me pretty tight, I feel squalmish all the time & I can't vomit of course.  I have done so pretty often but it won't come for me most of the time. 
 10.3.16 Friday Have managed to eat two meals and hold on to them but am not yet sure of keeping them.  Slept on deck last night & nearly perished with the cold.  We have passed Melbourne now 12.00 midday & they seem to be preparing for heavy weather so I can see good times coming for me. I turned the ship inside out looking for soda water before Dinner & couldn't get any still I managed some soup & Bread & Butter.  A lemon would have been usefull. 
 11.3.16 Saturday Now well in the bight. Still feel squeamish, we are packed like sardines.  The amount of gambling is astonishing.  I had the bad luck to break my fountain pen today.
