June 22ndWent out in a road reconnaisence today along the Hamadan Road.  Took Sgts. Place & Cameron.  Capt. Nicol (NZ) on another similar job with a couple of Sgts.  We did about 10 miles of road by taking compass bearings & rough notes which I compiled into a sketch on return to camp.  Mules provided for mounts.  We rigged up stirrups with rope & the big saddles proved rather comfortable.
