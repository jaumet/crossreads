<p>We sighted a Lighthouse at 7.45 P.M. and anchored outside Cape Harbour at 10 P.M.</p>

We got ashore at 9.30 A.M.  Cyril Gray and I had a look over the Town in the Forenoon and sent a few souvenirs, by the way, the native curios are very cheap.  In the afternoon we took a motor Ride to Houts Bay via Sea Point, Camps Bay, returning by a different route through Wynberg about 35 miles right around the mountain.

The Table Mountain was veiled in mist all day but we got some fine views of the Lions head &amp; the Rump (Signal Station).</p>
