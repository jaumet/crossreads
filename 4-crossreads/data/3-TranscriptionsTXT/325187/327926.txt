 [Sunday 2 July 1916] 
 Went to Kirk this morning- Saw Arnold there he is Regimental Doctor to the 2nd L.H.  I see the L.H. doings are being made public in the English papers, really we are not far away &amp; I hope to go some day ere long-   Not far from here on the Railway (Military) some Welsh Regiment started a Canteen for Sergeants Only &amp; asked the L.H. Sergeants to come over-   Our men got wind of this &amp; pencilling 3 stripes on their Hats about 300 got over &amp; drank the Canteen dry-  The Welshmen now are asking "How many Regiments we have? "How many Sergeants per Regiment" etc It's a bit of a shame, but our chaps were awful dry.
