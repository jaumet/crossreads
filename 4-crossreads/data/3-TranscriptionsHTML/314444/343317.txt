<p>At 1 a.m. on Monday we saddled up &amp; moved off to the attack.  This Brigade (2nd) was given the post of honor &amp; we had to make a big detour to South East in order to get round to the East of the city to prevent a retreat &amp; to stop Turkish reinforcements coming up.  It was a ticklish job &amp; risky &amp; according to German Officers (captured) a move they did not count on as they thought no troops would attempt to get into such a dangerous position &amp; even if they did would never get out again.</p>
<p>Yet we got in &amp; got out too, the latter by the skin of our teeth.  We <strike>were</strike> had their main position in front of us &amp; 13,000 Turkish reinforcements advancing from behind us.  Well to proceed. A very heavy fog came down before daylight; it was impossible to see more than a few yards, the country was very rough in places &amp; travelling very difficult, intensely cold just before dawn we were numbed &amp; wet with the fog.

Two or three of our boys could be seen with our glasses galloping across country, apparently to cut off the fugitives whoever they were.  It was a great race, lasted some time &amp; our lads won in the finish.  The quarry turned out to be a <strike>Austrian</strike> German General &amp; his staff including an Austrian Colonel &amp; others; travelling in two coaches.  They had been on their way from Beer Sheba to Gaza, &amp; were to take over the command of the troops at the latter place, against our attack.  Tho' they were within a few miles of their destination, were too late &amp; seeing our Brigade in the distance, turned</p>
