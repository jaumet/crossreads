<p>Wednesday 26 March 1919<br/>Colombo<br/>One of the best Hotels in the world I think.  We took Rickshaw &amp; did some shopping in Colombo, both Dolly &amp; the Babe looked wonderfully well.  I put them on board the Derbyshire at 5 p.m. &amp; returned to Ulimaroa.  The former boat left the harbour, some 4 hours ahead of our board &amp; as our Firemen are drunk not much chance of keeping up.  I am glad to say Capt. McLean is on the Derbyshire &amp; is very good to the little wife.<br/>Bought 50/-/- Bananas, Pineapples &amp; Oranges for the men &amp; 15000 cheer.</p>
