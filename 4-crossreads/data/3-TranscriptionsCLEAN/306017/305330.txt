  
 we reached the railhead & there we got our water bottles filled, but there was no water for the horses & as they were watered so early in the morning when they will drink very little they must have been thirsty.  Some Tommies were at the rail head & they gave us all sorts of accounts of the fighting at Katieh, [Katia?] so we began to think we would meet Turks any moment. 
 Our squadrons provided scouts as part of the main advance guard the next morning starting at 7 oclock we marched 3 miles & came on a deserted engineers camp.  The niggers about 600 of them had to leave it after the Tommies went back.  We pushed a couple of miles further on  & reached the Yeomanry camp  My party of scouts rode through it  Everything was lying about, but we had no time to get the loot & we halted a mile past it & the main body 6th & 7th occupied it & found all sorts of good things, beer & champagne
