<p>Wednesday, 17 January 1917</p>
<p>Weather getting warmer now, soon hot weather again. Another mine blown up on Beach. A little more peace from bombs last day or two. Our Airmen dropped a message in <strike>Beersheba</strike> to say for every Bomb the Turksdropped we would drop 5. My mind keeps thinking over the collection of worms at a spot on the Road at Rafa &ndash; so like a lot of Rabbits after you have cleaned a PIT out some jumping about others lying quite still. I'm quite used to such sights &amp; they do not affect me now I am glad to say.</p>
