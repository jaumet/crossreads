<p>if anyone could picture me standing surveying this peaceful scene.  No they think of us always fighting for our lives, facing unknown terrors, enduring untold hardships but never as enjoying the scenery in the very midst of War.  The dull rumblings break in on my thoughts and I turn again and think of those out there holding the thin black line that now marks the boundary of France.  Men instead of toll-gates guarding the border, bullets instead money as toll for those who try to pass, and yet back here perfect peace reigns, the village sleeps undisturbed by fears of the enemy, a tribute to that thin black line far out across the fields.<br/>It is All very beautiful and I wander thoughtfully down to the village wondering when all the world will feel this joy of blissful peace again.<br/>St Sauveur.<br/>24.11.16<br/>Initials.</p>
