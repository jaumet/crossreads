 [Saturday 4 November 1916] 
 A Hospital Boat has just passed us, with wounded &amp; I'm going back "cured" what a funny way it is to see the world!!! We never are to take our life Belts off, eat in them &amp; sleep in them- A Destroyer accompanies us  The troops on board are for Salonika  &amp; we may go round that way &amp; so be 3 weeks on board We may also go Via  Malta  which place I have not yet seen. We get wireless news of the war every day. Weather rough &amp; nearly all troops are sick!
