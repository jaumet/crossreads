<p>contained no news that we did not already know. The other afternoon I went to the top of the Mount from where we got a very interesting view, stretching out to the front.<br/>Dec. 19th Hallinghen.<br/>Beautiful day, the wind has dropped. We left Linden Loek on the 17th &amp; all trained at a siding near Neuve Eglise a very uncomfortable journey detraining at Desures about 6pm &amp; put the night in billets in that town. Desures is a fair sized place &amp; should have liked to have seen more of it, but the 8th Bde. were allotted to the place &amp; we had to go on to Hallinghen a very small village about 16 kilos from Boulogne, it was a very long &amp; tiring route march.<br/>It snowed all <strike>last</strike> the other night &amp; there were at least a couple of inches of snow everywhere. We have had a few very cold days. To day a thaw has set in &amp; the snow is melting so expect that everything will be very muddy &amp; sloppy.<br/>There is a great deal of holly out on the hedges, looking very pretty. Yesterday there was more snow about than I have ever seen before. In the morning we went for a walk as far as the village of Hubersent, which is about four kilos away &amp; came back through Le Turne. We had a good game in the snow.</p>
