 of our sheep have died this last week.  Mostly old ewes (Merino) &amp; nearly all nice &amp; fat.  We skinned over 30 since the beginning of the week.  And the worst part of it is they are nearly all in lamb, due in a few months time.  We put it down to wild melons, but have written in for stock inspector to come out.  The crows are very vicious.  I've seen them on a sick sheep's back &amp; pick first one eye &amp; then the other as the sheep stands under a tree. And now, Father, what do you think of Joan.  Of course I know you didn't see much of her, &amp; also there is another thing to be considered.  She hasn't had the advantages, educationally, that you have given us children, &amp; so therefore cannot expect to be A1 in this line.  But I think Ol liked her very much while she was staying at the Parsonage. Must close now with love to all at home, Ever your loving son, Leo.
