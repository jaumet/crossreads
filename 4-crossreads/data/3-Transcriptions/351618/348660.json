<p>Saturday 13th Nov<br/>Heard that Kitchener was to come to-day. It was a little like rain and I put my blankets out early to air but as it looked very threatening I went to bring them in before I left Headquarters for the 7th Battery and as I bundled them up a shell came over the ridge very quickly slap-bang &ndash; just a few yds from me. It is needless to say that I ducked pretty smartly but possibly after the danger had passed. Another shell followed but hit a little higher up and I cleared out to my dug out. Went to Y.M.C.A. Canteen for Ammunition Column to-day. Saw Olly when I was returning etc.</p>
<p>To-day was a lovely bright clean Autumn day &amp; with a touch of sharpness in the air that did not chill but tingled the blood like draughts of wine.</p>
