  
 It was in the second engagement on "Menin Road" that the Major was gassed & seeing I left two days after he I had been close for I know nothing of his second entry into the line. I will take the trip to Lane Cove one of these days & will let you know when I am coming. Hoping I find you well. Yours faithfully H W Fane Sgt. 
 [Herbert William Fane. 3041] [Major Garling was reported gassed on 26/9/1917]
