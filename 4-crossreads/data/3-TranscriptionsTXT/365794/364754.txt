Sunday 16 December 1917A quiet day and ward light.  Went to All Saints 6 p.m. with S. Heathcote.  A good sermon, text, Pray that your flight be not in the winter.  We are never to cease to pray and pray that our last flight be not in the winter of old age when all the bloo joys of life are gone & leaves stripped as it were but rather be taken in our bloom.  How sad to look round on the packed church of soldiers & think how many have fallen in their bloom & how many more must fall & how nurses like Kath fell in their bloom just as surely for others as these do.  Strange that in all that crowd I should share my book with a Q'lander.  Carols are being sung & very sad I feel thinking of happy past days for our family now alas! divided cruelly.
