<p>Forgot to mention also visited on Sunday the dead City &ndash; saw where the different companys have been excavating &amp; left the walls standing &ndash; it has been covered up by an earthquake.</p>
<p>Have also visited Mena Canp &amp; Mena Hospital which used to be a Tourist Hotel &ndash; Mena Camp was the First Australian Camp. They are very particular about travellers down the Canal &ndash; you have to get special permits etc. Went for a route march thro Matarich in the morning &amp; to an ostrich farm in the afternoon. Two aeroplanes flying &amp; manouvering all day above Camp &ndash; Very hot all day &ndash; I can easily manage 3 blankets of an night &ndash; On Sunday the English &amp; French people observe the Sabbath &ndash; but all works etc go on as usual amongst other Classes &ndash; Myself &amp; the Boys went to the Pictures on Sunday night they were not too bad &ndash; The Star was</p>
