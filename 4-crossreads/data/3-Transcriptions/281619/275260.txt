<p>The Suez canal defences are most elaborate.  The railway runs right up to the Western bank of the canal &amp; that with barges from Suez, Port Said &amp; Somalia can supply troops' stores &amp; ammunition at a moments notice.  The canal is bridged with a pontoon bdge &amp; with a punt transfers troops etc to the East bank.  From here a motor railway &amp; road runs out to 5 miles, Railhead where a supply depot &amp; base has been formed.  The advanced positions are at least 3 miles out.  Daily patrols of N.Z.M.R. go out reconnoitring &amp; along the bank of the canal a [indecipherable] is drawn along every night &amp; thus enabling the military to see if anyone has crossed the canal.  Aeroplanes go scouting every two or three days.</p>
<p>Feby 7th  Visit advanced positions.  There are no trenches but a series of redoubts separated by a few miles, commanding everything in front of them.  They are formed by a maze of sand bagged trenches &amp; have a front all round.</p>
<p>Mar 2-3rd Terrific wind storm. Typical sand storm of these parts.  The sand is so thick one cannot see many yards ahead &amp; the velocity with which it comes stings where it hits the bare skin.</p>
<p>Mar 8  Rumour is rife &amp; has it that within a month we will have left Egypt &amp; be in either France or England.  In fact everything points that way &amp; various units have already received marching orders.  Transport here is the greatest difficulty camels being mostly employed.  For the evacuation of sick &amp; wounded we alone have a sand cart with wide wheels drawn by mules, camel cradles which are two cradles one of which goes on either side of the camels hump &amp; a sand sledge carrying two patients on stretchers drawn by horses.  As for transport to Ismalia the barges &amp; boats are used on the canal.  We are allowed 1 gallon of water per diem per man.  Active service rations.</p>
<p>Mar 11th  Return to Sera peum.  Here all is activity where the whole of the Aust 1st Division is now in camp.  The whole of the forces have been divided &amp; new battalions made from the old ones &amp; these men together with 50000 from Home will make the Aust forces up to five divisions.  We expect to move very shortly to will [?] the prevalent &amp; most likely rumour is to France where I expect the Australians will be used for a great offensive.  Our own ambulance has been divided, B Section going to make the 13th field Amb.</p>
