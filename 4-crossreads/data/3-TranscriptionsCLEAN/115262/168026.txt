  
 Sunday 16 September 1917. 
 1 Taube over this morning. Went to Church Parade. The first time since leaving Moascar Isolation Camp. The rest of the day very little doing. 
 At the Aerodrome 1/2 mile from our position things are going ahead and very busy too. 
 No Aust. mail yet. 
 Received parcel from Ted Holden from 14 A.G.H.
