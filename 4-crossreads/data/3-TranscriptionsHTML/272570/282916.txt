<p>Danny will drop the lot". Not many minutes afterwards, after some shells had burst, a chap came down for the stretcher-bearers, &amp; true enough, Danny had been killed when he had cut the rations up to hand round. God, it's a cursed game; it's a pity something would not end this awful roar. Lt. Hall was groaning as the stretcher bearers carried him past me on a stretcher. <br/>Monday 19 Aug.<br/>The night dragged on, till at 3.30 a.m. Fritz opened out with his artillery, &amp; for 40 minutes we got hell.  Luckily the shots were passing just over us, &amp; it was cruel to hear the big shells shrieking towards you &amp; bursting around.  The light was misty, &amp; it was very hard to see if he was coming at us &ndash; anyhow a man had to keep his nut down to stop being hit by the flying bits of shell.  Most of us had the "wind up", but we stuck it, &amp; I looked over the top to see if the Hun was coming beside Sam Hensby on his Lewis gun.  At stand down we turned in, but at 10 a.m. a Hun bombardment made us hop up &ndash;a day bombardment was most unusual lately, &amp; they poured over in a mighty roar.  The poor old 14th Battalion seemed to be getting them fair on their trench, but they either fell in front of, or just behind our company.  We looked into No Man's Land</p>
