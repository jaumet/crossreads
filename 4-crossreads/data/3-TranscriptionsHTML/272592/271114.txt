<p>&amp; etc.   I saw the officer in charge &amp; he got the cooks to boil us a dixie of tea for dinner.</p>
<p>15th.   It appears this job we are on lasts while the Brigade is in reserve &amp; we have to sleep &amp; tucker over here, we did not bring our blankets or packs with us so when the work was finished I asked the officer in charge for the loan of one of the motor lorries to run us round to our Camp to get our things so he lent us one &amp; we slipped round had our tea got paid &amp; packed up &amp; back we come it was raining pretty heavily too but we were right for once &amp; under cover, so we will be here for a day or two doing fatigues</p>
