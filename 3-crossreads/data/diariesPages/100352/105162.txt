Thursday 10th September
During the morning the "Sydney" the T.P.Ds left us steamed for Raboul on New Pommern ? the capital of German New Guinea ? to demand its surrender ? so the "Rumour " says. This time it may not be so far out as the same story was told us by the Major. Shortly afterward we passed the only point of interest seen during the day ? a coral atoll. This was a very good specimen of "this physiographical feature of the second order". A ring of coral encircling calm pellucid seas supporting with slight break at intervals a thick belt of tropical vegetation in which the coconut palm predominated. There appeared to be no inhabitants nor indeed any sign of life. With the breakers dashing on the fringe it presented a very beautiful spectacle - a veritable emerald set in a sparking sea.
Kit inspection during the morning. Second dose of quinine ? "Harris again" many times during the parade. Had customary wash. Moustache struggles bravely on. We land to take Raboul tomorrow. Exciting details in the next issue.
