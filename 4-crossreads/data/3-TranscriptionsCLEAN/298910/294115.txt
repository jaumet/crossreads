  
 Father Law equal to the occasion, he put his torch on him & said - Well yes for this time I agree with you - Anzac very profuse in his apologies when he recognised him. 
 Sunday  18/3/17 
 Very mild & fine day. Div. H.Q'rs established 2 miles beyond Bapaume, much patrol fighting going on 7 miles out. Everybody & everything nearly shifting forward - Fritz set nearly every 3rd Building alight in Bapaume & blew up everything of any use - everybody moving very cautiously on account of mines - also very careful of picking up Souvenirs - we treat all water with suspicion - Good few trench feet & wounded through - some L.H. & several Indian - they report no sight of main body of enemy, ten miles out only patrols. Australians also took La Fransloy - much to the disgust of 20th Div of Tommys who were reckoning on being first there - all available Amb men pushing on with Division. Got official news of the Abdication of the Czar.
