<p>October 22<br/>"Really it was in two days that ended in his only possessing his trousers and boots and sox - shirt, tunic - everything else had gone towards dressings!"</p>
<p>"Do you remember at [indecipherable]? &ndash; put on their tickets 'Dressing Station under heavy shell fire' &ndash; and send them on!"</p>
<p>"He's a good man is Gertie &ndash; and he looks after his men!"</p>
<p>77.<br/>A wounderful mail:  one dear letter from Mother of Sept. 6 &ndash; written hurriedly to catch a suddenly heard of mail:  one from Billy &ndash; in Blighty and doing well full of his old easy cheeriness, and one note from Elsie&hellip; And&hellip;. from the T.B.C. 'Certain Noh Plays of Japan' from the Cuala Press..and ending with a delightful note &ndash;</p>
<p>'..finished on the twentieth day of July, in the year of the Sinn Fein rising, nineteen hundred and sixteen.'</p>
<p>Now of the Cuala books I've "Passages from the Letters of J.B. Yeats", "Reveries over Childhood &amp; Youth", W.B. Yeats, "Synge:  An Impression by John Masefield" &ndash; the wounderful poet on the exquisite dramatist&hellip; these if these mails have not been torpoeded.</p>
<p>And from Henderson,s, Shaw's 'Sanity of Art', Vernide's "War Poems" and "Poems", Alan Seeger.</p>
<p>Vernide I think is 'dud' &ndash; except for one beautiful poem, To an English Sheep Dog.. which approaches &ndash; in a handling of homely sentiment, to the magnificence of Hodgson's "The Bull".</p>
<p>And from Beaumonts, a most courteous note:  Index their newpress edition is 10/6&hellip; To-Day by a misprint printed 1/6&hellip;  They await my instructions&hellip;but before noting this write of 1st edition of Masefield, of J.C. Squire and Hodgson's Poems&hellip; the latter at half a guinea.</p>
<p>Buck's to blame for the altered dating of the last entries&hellip; last night in bed, starting to enter up, he informed me it was the 22, his manner left no room or reason for doubt&hellip; so after all I've not 'lost a day'.</p>
<p>The day fine, and full of quietness, no Boche have yet been over:..  as yet.  The rumour of last night &ndash; that five Zeps had been brought down raiding London is true&hellip;. but the French had the doing of it.</p>
