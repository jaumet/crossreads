  
 get  transferred to the ship. 
 I am sorry I missed seeing Les who has undergone an operation for appendicitis, & was on furlough in the country for a week. Walter says however that he will give Leo my address and ask him to write to me if he gets any further extension. 
 If Walter remains in England for a bit after leaving hospital I hope he may be persuaded to come down to us here for a few days' rest, preliminary to a little sightseeing or museum work in London. He will of course cable you if her gets instructions to embark. Meanwhile you may rest assured that he is coming on quite satisfactorily. 
 With kind regards Very Sincerely Yours Leslie Waterhouse
