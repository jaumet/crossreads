<p>Saturday 30 August 1919<br/>The court sat again today. It has finished now tho' I think. Went ashore at 11 am. Got a car (Cadillac) &amp; went to Amanzimtoti River. It is about 20 miles away from here. Had a  most interesting day. Had a race with a train &amp; won. Had lunch at an hotel out there &amp; then rowed to the end of the river. Got out there &amp; walked up a steep hill &amp; visited a few Kraals. Very good. Took some snaps. Every snap we took of a nigger we had to give 6d. Dead funny. Kraals were very clean. Cow &amp; pigs etc. don't sleep with the family but outside in an enclosure. Had dinner at the Marine Hotel (the best in the place) &amp; then came back to the boat. Had a most interesting day. It rained again just after we came back.</p>
<p>Sunday 31 August 1919<br/>Left Durban about 9 am. Only lost 17 more men making a total of 26 since we left London. We sent two captains over to the Bahia Costilles &amp; the Bakara is sending 150 men &amp; some officers. Guess that will wake the mutineers up some. Very heavy swell all day. Quite a lot sick &amp; a lot missed dinner. I slept nearly all day. Am not too bad. Things have been falling over all day long. Very little breeze. Sky is quite clear today &amp; tonight it is glorious. Saw hundreds of divers diving into the water after fish Looked well. Posted a letter to Nettie.</p>
