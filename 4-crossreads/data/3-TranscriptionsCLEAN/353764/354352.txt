On examining the Shore with Glasses we could discern a Warship anchored there, also rows of Red Tiled roof houses.  It is very mountainous County & extremely hot. 
 We have since been running up the Arabian Coast & passed the place where the Mohammedans make their Pilgrimages to "Mecca" "Medina" & "Jeddah" although no one who is not of their faith is allowed to go.  unfortunately the Pilgrim Season has just passed so we did not see them, but I understand that some of them come right out from the Shore in their "Dhows". 
 In describing the Arabian Country & Coast Line, I would like to say that it is a terrible place.  The Coast for a long way is dotted with huge mountains of sand which make the eyes very sore to look at it for any time.  On proceeding along further it opens out & rolls back into the interior in one vast desert, with nothing but roll & ridge of Sand.  Absolutely no veg-
