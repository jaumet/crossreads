<p>Sinn Fein Song / current 1918<br/>(brought back from Ireland by Don McKinnon)</p>
<p>I'll sing you a ditty of Dublin's fair city,<br/>And a place called Mountjoy which all of you know;<br/>'Twas there of all places the boys cut the traces<br/>And got out of prison, alive, alive Oh.</p>
<p>The first was bold Barton, when he was departin',<br/>Left a note for the Boss, his politeness to show;<br/>And a dummy in order to fool the poor warder<br/>But Barton had hopped it, alive, alive Oh.</p>
<p>J.J. Walsh and Pierce Beasley the trick did suite gas'ly,<br/>Some pro-German devil a ladder did throw;<br/>Then some twenty Sinn Feiners, like acrobat trainers,<br/>Scaled the wall and got free all alive, alive Oh.</p>
<p>They're thinking tomorrow, to call it Mountsorrow,<br/>It's made of John Bull such a terrible show:<br/>His prisons no longer have locks any stronger,<br/>To keep in Sinn Feiners alive, alive Oh.</p>
<p>I'll finish my rhyme now, I think it's near time now,<br/>The people are laughing wherever you go,<br/>It's caused great elation in this ancient nation,<br/>Sinn Feiners, pro-Irish, alive, alive Oh.</p>
