  
 7/5/19 Marcinelle A day of loafing. Afternoon went to the Railway station and had a good hot bath. The percentage of khaki to civil clothes is getting perceptibly less. The canal is very pretty now with the bursting green leaves. An aged beggar sits on the big bridge a mass of dirt. Returning via back streets there are slummy houses and dirty children - but we have these also at home. At mess we discussed the fact of tomorrow being 4th anniversary of leaving Australia. I am now the only original officer left with the 22nd Battalion. Talk today of a gratuity to the A.I.F. later on. With Gorman spent a very pleasant evening with M. Cornil who produced his "nonante huit". Went to bed and slept more than soundly.
