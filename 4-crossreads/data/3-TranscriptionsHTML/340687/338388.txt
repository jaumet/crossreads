<p>March, 1917. 5th in Lent. Sunday 25<br/>Day cool but fine and sunny. Summer time established. Took engine to pieces in morning and finished job in afternoon and then filled the tanks. Cleaned up &amp; tea of peaches. Wrote to Melv in evening. Heavy guns firing rather heavily all day towards Bapaume. Tightened pump stuffing box and works better now.</p>
