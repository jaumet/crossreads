<p>at le Havre</p>
<p>24/8/17 - Rather a quiet day; interspersed however with bursts of artillery over us, both our own &amp; enemy.</p>
<p>I cleaned, examined &amp; reset 8 boxes of Mills bombs &amp; Rifle Grenades. They were caked in mud to such an extent as to be hardly recognisable. I also inspected new place for Mule dump. The mule train brings up rations every night to a dump &amp; my party then man-handle these to cook houses, which are situated in German Cement block houses. Casualties about a dozen last night. Received letter from Gladys. Writing home to J.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>25/8/17</u>&nbsp; Heavy straffing of our right front line by enemy artillery, to which ours replied in retaliation, three times today. Luckily very few casualties.</p>
<p>I cleaned Bombs &amp; Ammunition. Three Enemy planes over us this evening. We fired at them with Lewis Guns &amp;</p>
