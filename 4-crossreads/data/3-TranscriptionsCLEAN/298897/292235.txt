  
 Then we had mud for the remainder of the day.  The weather was too rough so did not go aboard the Swiftsure as I intended.  Nights now are very long & dreary & take some 'putting in'.  All troops now off Anzac, the evacuation having been very successful no casualties taking pace.  A certain amount of stores had to be destroyed but the whole affair was splendidly managed & favoured by good weather was a great success. 
 Wednesday 22nd Cold & dreary.  The great event of the day was the arrival of our long lost mail, 22 bags in all out of which I received 19 letters and four papers.  One letter was dated May 18th having taken 7 months to reach me.  I spent the afternoon & night reading my letters. 
 Thursday 23rd Sudden news came at midday to clean out the Hospital & pack up ready to leave at an hours notice.  This was good news & we were all cheered with the prospect of new oceans & fresh pastures. Most of the patients were sent off to their units the remainder being sent off to No. 3 A.G.H.  They were all sorry to leave as they received first class treatment, best food & plenty of it, tinned fruit, biscuits tobacco cigarettes etc all of the best.
