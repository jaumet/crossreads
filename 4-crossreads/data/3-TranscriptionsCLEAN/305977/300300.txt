  
 December 1915 us & a lot more marched into camp to day.  We were given almost a freehand only 1 roll call per day & not much said if you werent there.  Most of the boys were out for a good time & a fair amount of leave was granted.  There was a lot of liqueur about.  A big mail was in but I only got a couple of letters.  I went into town at night but came out early.  There was a huge crowd in town & you could hardly move for soldiers.  It is much different to the old days. 
 Wednesday 29th We paraded in the morning 3 squadrons.  Some of the troops had no more than 6 men on parade out of  full strength of 36.  In the afternoon we paraded & all the old hands were given the opportunity of coming into the regiment, if not they could stop in Maadi for a spell as it is
