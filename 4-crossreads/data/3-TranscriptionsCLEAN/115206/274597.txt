At BeutinToday has been a glorious day, I went for a walk this morning along a sunlit track bordered by trees on one side and hedges and a stream on the other.The morning air was frosty and sparkling. I came to an old log straddled across a tree. Here I sat and wrote a long letter home. We are being paid in all probability tomorrow.
