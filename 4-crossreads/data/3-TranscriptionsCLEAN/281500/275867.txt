my men up for a fatigue party was wanted to take hot tea to the "firing line", after these had got away we turned in, but could get scarcely any sleep for our possy was too narrow & water was oozing out from the sides, at 12 oclock I had to hop out & find some more of my men for another party & then again at 5 oclock I was out so you can see very little sleep came my way.
This morning the old Hun is shelling us fairly consistent but nothing like what we are giving him our guns never seem to cease.  Had nothing up my sleeve this afternoon for some big shells dropped uncomfortably close, one man was killed & another wounded, its a wonder more were not skittled.
