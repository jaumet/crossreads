 This morning we received orders to shift our camp as we have been in A Sqds ground & we had to move to make room for reinforcements that arrived last night, so we put the morning in making ourselves comfortable once more & are now camped on a small terrace with a couple of reinforcement Officers, we are in a much better position than the last "bivy" & are OK here; Hobson Randall &Fox swam out to the beached sailing vessel to-day & managed to force some slabs off the hatchway & found one of the sails nearly new & commandeered it for the Officers dugout also as much firewood as they could carry .Penny managed to secure 1 doz eggs at 1/6 at Anzac this afternoon so we are still right for rice custard.
