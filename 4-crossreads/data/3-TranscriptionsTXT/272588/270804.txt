Wednesday 20 NovemberVery busy to-day in anticipation of moving to-morrow, the beginning of our march to Germany.  Very foggy & cold.
Thursday 21 NovemberBeautiful day & at 9.30 we began our move to Germany, the first stage to Mazinghien about 8 miles being marched to-day. We are now at Mazinghien, a village badly knocked about. Rumours are rife that W.M. Hughes has objected to our going to Germany & that the move is being cancelled & we are going Home at early date.
