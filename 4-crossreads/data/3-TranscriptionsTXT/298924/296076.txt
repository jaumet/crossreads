 Friday 4 April 1919 Cold better &amp; Diary finished. Only doing small rate as coal is bad but hope to arrive at Albany on Tuesday. Later.  We are not going Albany but to Freemantle.  I shall wire for a room to Lavender &amp; Scotts Hotel as being Easter they may all be crowded.  I think I have a good chance of getting off at Melbourne now &amp; the Derbyshire will only be a day &amp; a half ahead of me.
