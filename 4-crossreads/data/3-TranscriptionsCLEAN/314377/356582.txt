  
 We as usual, inspected the principal parts of the town. We were on the look out for bread as usual and succeeded in getting a supply. How we managed here was by assisting some French people to pull the hops from off the vines. They were very careful indeed of their bread. 
 Our billets were in an open field The way we camped was as follows. Lines were stretched between trees and over these wires were blankets thrown (over) which had been previously knotted together A hayrick in a nearby field loaned the bedding I put it back after we had finished with it.
