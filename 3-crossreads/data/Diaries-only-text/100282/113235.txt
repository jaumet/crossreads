So ended my trip to Scotland the finest holiday I have ever had in my life, after leaving Edinburgh I did not care how soon my leave finished for it would be rotten without Peggy. On the way down to Liverpool we passed through typical Scottish country all hills valleys creeks everywhere fences made of granite the old Scotch firs climbing about the hills, when we got to Carlisle we had to change I had an hour a half looking round the old town. Ran into Liverpool about 5 oclock I set out to find Mr Hawley's place which I thought from the address I had was at Kirkby but no one seemed to have even heard of the place not even the policemen, they knew of Kirkdale Kirby, at any rate I thought the best thing to do to make sure was to go round to the Post Office
