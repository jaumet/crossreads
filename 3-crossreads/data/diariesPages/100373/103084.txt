the place a picturesque Eastern appearance.

All along the street one finds the shop, or a better term for them, stalls are open to the street. One rarely finds a window in the shops. They have a very leisurely way of doing business. The people will sit for hours bargaining for articles.

One often comes across the shop keeper and others seated inside the shop conversing with one another in what seems to be a very brotherly fashion. This seems to be amongst the Egyptians, a favourite pastime and a favourite means of doing business.

It is when I get into the side streets or to be more correct alleys that I find the greatest pleasure and fascination.

In spite of the unkempt roadway and the musty smell one seems to forget these things and look on the new scene, away from the heat of the burning sun, with great pleasure and a feeling that one has been transported to a new and enchanted world.

Beautifully engraved Brass and Copper ware are favourite articles of merchandize with the natives. These ornaments, Coffee Sets, Plates, Rose Bowls, Vases, Obelisks, Candlesticks etc. are beautifully engraved by hand. This process one see often being done by the native workmen outside the shop door and it is marvellous how expert they become. Even little boys about ten years of age turn out beautiful work.
