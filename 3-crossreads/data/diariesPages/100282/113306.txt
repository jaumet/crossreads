put me in mind of a hop over with these great bombs bursting scores of machine guns rattling away, we could get scarce any sleep the whole night, it was just the night for raids, a brilliant moonlight bright as day, we could see the great "Gothas" quite plainly, I don't know if they brought any down or what damage they done, must have done some for it was like a battle they just emptied them out like cartloads of bricks back they went for more, by the way they carted their eggs over, I should think they had a contract on were getting so much per dozen. I can tell you these bombs are not the nicest things to have falling around you, for you are so helpless against them. Taking a line from what is going on now Heavens only knows what next Spring is going to bring forth in the matter of fighting in the air, I should not be surprised to see it finished there, both sides seem to have given up the idea of going for one another like they used to
