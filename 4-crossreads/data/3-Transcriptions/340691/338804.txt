<p>look round shop and talk to instructor  Quite a good shop and slightly better than ours. Came back to Adderley Street and had lunch. Very good meal at Creamery for 2/- of 6 courses. Went down to Anzac Lounge at 2 and caught charabanc straight away for Hout Bay. Rather bumpy but otherwise good. Went by Strand Street &amp; Somerset Road to Sea Point, Camps Bay. After Sea Point followed Road on sea front all the way winding with the mountain and very pretty with views of bays and private houses. Got to Hout Bay at 3.15 and walked down to Bay and spent a good time clambering over the rocks and admiring the scenery. Came back at 4.30 and had welcome afternoon tea in the Pavilion. Very hot but shady everywhere and house surrounded by trees. Met the three others who went by a different car  Started back at 5 and cooler. Pretty stiff climb but wonderfully pretty through long cool avenues and pretty groves of pines and undergrowth. came through Wynberg and Rondebosch and over Kloof Nek. Wonderful view right across peninsula to Simons Town and Cape town and stayed there about 10 minutes admiring the view and back through town to Anzac Lounge. Suburban private houses very pretty and original. Had a good wash and a good meal of egg and tomato sandwiches and fruit salad afterwards. Arrived back about 6 and after tea went on to pics after deciding not to go to Theatre. Didn't go to Pierrot</p>
