And the day of toil is over and the eve of rest is nigh
Oh, its good to lie and ponder
On the old home over yonder
And to know the day of exile passeth by.
LM 21.6.17
Beni Selah
Palestine
Our "Nark"
1
There are men whom we all admire
In the ranks of the Anzac Boys
They are with us in all our sorrows
And laugh with us in our Joys
And it doesn't much matter whether
They're commissioned rank or no
They're men with men's hearts in them
Or we've mostly found it so.

But the best crowds have these blighters
To stir up the spirit of Hate
For a harsh deed done to a Soldier
Is surely done to his mate
For Cobber will stick to Cobber
For C.B. up to worse
And the Blighter who caused the trouble
Is sure of a blood red curse
