The camps the last night or two have been chock full of drunks, that's the result of a double pay I'll bet in a few more days 90 % of them will be "Stony" & "bumming" for the next fortnight & whats more all the Sgts Messes are having free nights one Mess at a time so the Sgts have been well looked after but they are a fairly quiet lot, what we call decent drunks, come home & get to bed quietly & keep no one awake bit different to a lot of the Diggers, they argue, row, sing, swear, & fight half the night I can hear them at it now as I scribble these few lines before turning in  Looks as if we are going to have a wet day tomorrow for a thin drizzle is falling a little heavier than an ordinary "Scotch Mist", stiff luck if we have another wet week end, they are the limit for making things miserable
