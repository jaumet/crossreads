  
 quarters only a few streets away, into the brilliantly lighted shops and fine buildings, whilst the horses flashing to and fro are simply superb. We did not go into many of the native streets leaving them for another time.  A very amusing incident occurred during the day. They had a store tent near our hut with a guard placed round it, and they removed the tent but the guards are still seen marching round and round the empty space. Thursday 27/1/16.

Here we saw scholars repeating their lessons, all the time swaying backwards and forwards, which is supposed  to be an aid  to their memory. The next Mosque we visited was 1000 years old and the stairs leading to the liwan or
