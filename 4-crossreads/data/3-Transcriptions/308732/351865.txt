<p>30/7/18 Two days ago we had a number of Americans attached to us, some to each platoon, for them to get a little experience. They seem a very decent lot, and they and our fellows get along very well together. I think they are only with us for a week or so. It sounds funny to me to here them talk, I have a job to understand some of them, especially the way they pronounce some of the words. There is no doubt there is a mixture of dialects &amp; languages spoken here by all the different nations in arms. Of course as you very likely know, for a long time there have been many thousands of American troops mixed through the French, British and Australian troops, getting a little actual experience before going on their own, and there is no doubt they are very keen. Last night we moved up from our position in the old British front line, and took over advanced posts. I have one with 10 men &amp; one Lewis Gun three of the men are Americans. The post is an old one of Fritz but there is not much of his stuff here, he evidently left it</p>
