Croydon &amp; again at Brighton but this infernal woman stuck to us like glue, &amp; I only lost her when I changed for the last time at Ford, trains over here run anyhow nowadays &amp; its pretty rotten travelling,  I arrived at Littlehampton towards evening &amp; made straight round to Mr Dukes, we then had tea &amp; he &amp; I &amp; Mrs Elliott went for a stroll round the promenade it was a glorious evening &amp; the place was crowded, there were hundreds of Yanks taking the air, they all come from the great aerodromes which they are putting up down here, by this time I was beginning to feel pretty rotten, &amp; when we got home I was jolly glad, we stopped up fairly late yarning &amp; when I eventually climbed into bed I was done to the world.</p>
