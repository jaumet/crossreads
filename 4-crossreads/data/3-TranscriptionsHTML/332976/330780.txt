<p>December 1916<br/>31st   New Years Eve- Sunday is a free day here, &amp; it is the first free Sunday we have had for a long while.  We only had one parade at 9 a.m. at which rifles &amp; gas helmets were inspected &amp; after that, the day was our own.  The estaminets are open on Sunday &amp; by bedtime the boys were rather merry.  There are a great number of Australians in the town &amp; the streets were crowded with them although they were considerably quiet.<br/>The shops &amp; Estaminets close at 8 P.M. &amp; by 10 o'clock everything was quiet &amp; the majority in bed.  We were informed today that leave to Amiens would be granted in a few days.</p>
