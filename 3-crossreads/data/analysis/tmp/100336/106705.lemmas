 I repli about five day , think that perhap they had not found out we had been miss so long . The Command went into his offic and return with a paper . He then told us that we had been away for over 19 day . We knew then that they must have found out just after we left camp , so we thought it best to tell them everyth which we did . They did noth but curs us . Then the Command step up to me and was go to smack me in the face which is their usual custom but he did not . He then sent for two sentri and made them bind our arm behind our back with rope , which they did with a will . We thought that we were in for a sever flog . We were march off the verandah befor we had gone far we were call back and after the Command and polic offic held a short consult the rope were taken off us and we were lock in a spare room next to the command 's offic . The room was infest with mice . There was a hole in the wall close to my head and I amus myself tri to catch the mice as they went in and out of this hole . Eventual I caught one by the tail just as his bodi disappear . I could not pull her out but kept let her go as far as I could in the hole and then pull it out with a jerk . When I thought I had punish it suffici I let go . It doe not take much to amus one under such condit . In the morn we were brought out of the room . Two sentri were put in charg of us and instruct to march us to Belemedik , the headquart about 10 mile distant . Of cours we were given no food . We were rather glad of this as the Command there was a Lieuten Command from the Turkish Navi and we knew that he had kind feel toward the English have serv under English Admiral . On arriv there we went befor this Command . He said he could do noth but wait instruct from Constantinopl . In the meantim we would have to go into prison on half ration of bread and water . We were in prison for a week when the Command sent for us . He had just receiv a wire from Constantinopl . They seem particular anxious to know which one of us had suggest make this escap , but we would give them no satisfact . They also want to know who gave us the inform and suppli with red fezz etc. , but we had an answer readi for each question . We did not throw ani suspicion on the Greek . Dure the day Nichol had been ompal of a terribl headach and show sign of a bad attack of Malaria come on . While we were be question he fell down in a faint but soon came round . The Command seem veri much upset and postpon the examin till he was well . Dure the afternoon a Turkish Colonel was visit the Camp and in his round of inspect with the Command he came into the prison . My mate was lie down sick with Malaria . The Command had an interpret with him . Of cours the Colonel want to know who we were . I told him that we had been attempt an escap , as it was our duti as British to escap from our enemi countri
