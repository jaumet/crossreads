22.7.15Thurs. 22nd.  A few shells came over & burst in the Turks trenches opposite about 10 oclock last night, we were expecting a big demonstration but it was a false alarm.  General Byrdwood [Birdwood] was around inspecting this morning.  Great preparations are being made to-day to give the wily Turk a warm reception tonight as it is confidently expected that they are to make a big attack & everyone has to stand to arms all night waiting for them, needless to say everyone is in a state of excitement & looking forward to it as we all want to see a big decisive battle to end it one way or another.  The Turks have been shelling Popes Hill a bit this afternoon & one of our lads (Rider) was wounded last night by a bomb, but rifle & machine gun fire has not been speaking at all.  Our men have been busy the last day or two erecting barb wire entanglements etc.
