<p>mile march with all kit, and arrived dead tired at the Anzac Detail Camp at 4 p.m. After looking round the Camp, and having a cup of coloured water, and a few biscuits, we turned in at 7 p.m. Next morning Sunday December 5th, we were up for kit inspection at 6 p.m. [a.m.] and until noon were busy fixing up our tents. After dinner Marshall and myself went across to one of the many Greek Villages and spent the last couple of shillings we had on Oranges, Chocolates, and figs. These places were very interesting and especially the Greek Church at the top of the hill. We were informed during the day that we would wait here for the 5th Brigade which was coming across to rest. On this Island there were thousands of troops of all descriptions. All the Greeks wear Goatskin Vests in the Winter. Water was very scarce and one had to line up for it and wait at the Village well for about an hour to get the water bottle full. Next morning on parade were told to pack up and proceed to the front. We embarked on board the "Osmariah", speed 22 knots, and travelled to Anzac with lights out, no smoking, and absolute silence.</p>
<p>The first glimpse of war was passing Cape Hellas, where the British Troops were, and those guns did "hum some". There were numbers of Men-of-war all round us, and at intervals a search-light would show out. All the trip along the coast to Anzac, guns were firing on shore and on the ships. We anchored off Anzac at 8 p.m. We were altogether at the stern of the ship, waiting to go ashore, when there was a groan from a fellow not far off, who had managed to stop a spent bullet. It was hard luck to be sent to the Hospital Ship wounded so near Anzac, and not to see the place by day.</p>
