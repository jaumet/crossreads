Sunday 25 March 1917
It is a treat to ride a decent horse again after the half drafts at the Cavalry School. Owing to the sand our horses have all learned to walk fast. I suppose its trying to keep up to the fast walkers & not trot, but no Wesminster is equal to the old horses for sale.
All day & night freight trains go bye loaded up with forage & Bully Beef & Biscuits & in the Bay or such as it is, are many boats unloading stores for the Army. You might think we talk a lot about the war, but I'm afraid Officers & man's chief topic of conversation is Girls & their tucker. Read "A Wife out of EGYPT" by Douglas Siddern MISS LORIMER (it is good).
