<p>raised in Australia and another referendum on the matter taken. It further added that the figures at present were, <u>for</u> 500,000 against 700,000. Saturday afternoon one of the transports following us turned away in another direction apparently making for a French port direct. Sunday still bleak and rough quite a pleasant surprise was sprung on all the boys today, a Xmas present from the War Chest being given to all men on board. It consists of cigarettes, tobacco, tin of ginger, tin of throat jubes, chewing gum writing pad etc very acceptable articles. Monday one of the other transports also turned off in the direction of France so we were only three strong, the Battleship, Euripides and Aeneas, and we zigzagged all day, just as darkness was falling vivid flashes showed on the horizon and all of a sudden the message "we are coming" was floated across the water to us a few minutes later two large destroyers came tearing at express speed alongside and we knew that these were to guard us through the dangerous waters. The following morning Xmas day we found the battleship had left us during the night, evidently to pick up the other two (2) boats for France. We also found that a large number destroyers had also made their appearance. After dinner (a special Xmas, one of consisting mainly of roast pork and very little else) the ship all of a sudden puit on full speed and it shook all over with vibration. We were making a dash to reach port that night and the next few hours were quite exciting although nothing sensational happened, toward 5 o'clock we sighted Eddystone Lighthouse, and then knew we only had a very short way to go. Two hours latter we arrived at Devonport &ndash; we had really done the trick. From there of course the feeling of tension released and we all, I think (officers included) celebrated the event the particular way which suited each one of us.<br/>Driver Reg Hockey 29 Reinf.
