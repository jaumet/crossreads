<p>Mch 1 digging this afternoon. Plenty of tucker. Fair am't of water. Camels arriving all night.</p>
<p>2 Shifted camp, over railway. Loading Camels &amp; horses &amp; putting up tents. Blowing like the very devil. Good job this, about 5 hours a day. Plenty of niggers working here; most of them being Egyptian Army fatigues. No wash since Feb 29th&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [in margin]  (Ess)</p>
<p>3 Broken sleep last night. Loading again this mng. Still blowing like the very devil. March is the windy month. Good steak for brek. Knocked off at 10 oclock. OC took several snaps of Camels which were playing up. Managed to nick a mat for our tent. One chap here with a bully-beef tin partly filled with water colored with Condys, (washed his feet)</p>
<p>4 Water fatigue today. Carried couple of dixies full. Slight touch of dysentery caused by sand &amp; water. Blowing hard as usual. Collecting water pipe connectors; not a bad job either. Washed sox &amp; feet in about a quart</p>
