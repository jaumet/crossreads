  
 Thursday 6 December 1917. 
 Bivouaced at 12.45 am. No stand to. In bivouac 1 mile from village of Tebna. Cold & bleak day. My camel's back crook after last nights movements. 
 Bgde got lost last night and only travelled 8 miles direct although the track they took was about 15 miles. Stayed here  most of  the day & tried to move out at night but rain made country impassable. 
 Ration convoy was lost & rain came on again so Bgde could not move.
