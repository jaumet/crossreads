<p>March 4 1919<br/>Influenza broke out on the Ceramic &amp; we were delayed nearly a month. During the month we had several fake alarms that we were off. Half a dozen times the boat lists were made out but failed to materialize. It was a miserable time waiting in expectation. We had the easiest time I have ever had which made the time pass very slowly. With the exception of a dozen men for Guard duty &amp; the fatigue party there was mostly nothing to do. We spent the time going into Ismalia &amp; the various Concert partys.</p>
