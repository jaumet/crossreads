 1/2/19 Gourdinne Snow was falling steadily in heavy flakes at 8 o'c and continued until well on the morning. Arrangements under way to receive our draft of 23rd. men and held a Conference at 10.30 a.m. little Les Turner G Bailey, P Chalmers, Mackinnon and Howell are now on the Staff. Spent the afternoon up at our Printing Office and then round at Yvonne Legait's where they were making pancakes with the aid of a kind of iron book in which they fold the dough. Today was a cold snowy day with few charms for outdoor walking. We spend 14000 francs a pay here on a strength of 250 men. Plenty of money circulation due to the troops. Dined with the General at Nallines [Nalinnes] and farewelled Brown. A very pleasant dinner.
