March 5, 1916 Sunday
Revielle as per usual
Horses exercised this morning then we had the day off, no mail no pay, so wrote letters in the afternoon.
One of our planes left for Assuit where we are rumored to be going to, the Lovat Scouts have gone also. Armoured cars have been making demonstrations daily the niggers don't half like it.
Played cards at night then did the next best thing turned in at 10 oclock.
Our arabic is still improving.
