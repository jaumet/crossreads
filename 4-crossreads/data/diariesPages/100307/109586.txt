Camp near Le Barque
24/3/17
The commencement of the equinocial gales cold penetrating wind which makes tent life almost a hardship. In spite of a feeble sun clung closely to a brazier all day. Battalion all on salvage work "Percy" put over a few heavy shells which passed back towards Butte. Padre Lamble came in to see me during afternoon ? much aged. Mail included a card and letter from "ma marriane". Many papers from Australia and England. Orders arrived for our relief by 13th Bde and return to Mametz Camp tomorrow. Brigadier decides to transfer Bazeley to 23rd as Adjutant. Forbes looked in for a talk during the morning Rumoured that ?Batey? is getting his extra star temporarily. Srewart left on leave for England taking a couple of diaries for safekeeping at the bank and order for a tunic on Berkleys. Padre Durnford borrowed some tarpaulins and made a windscreen for his service at 6 pm. Spiller to act as Adjutant until Stewart's return. Very sorry about Bazeley going.
