 Sunday 3rd March 1917 [1918] A day off once more and a long quiet morning in bed with reading &amp; letter writing.  Wrote Nell, Ida, &amp; Mag. After lunch went with S. Talon &amp; Capt. Chiel in garry to Citadel then walked to the top &amp; took snaps, then back to Shepheards for tea 5 p.m. &amp; after that All Saints &amp; home in a garry.  A very enjoyable afternoon with two nice English people &amp; no one could wish for anything more. For the first time since coming away I wished to be back when reading about surfing at Manly &ndash; not yet however.
