  
 Sgt Clerke went up with me & had tea with us at Barnes on the first afternoon, & spent the evening with us.  Lily enjoyed herself immensely, although we did nothing but talk the whole evening. The following day Lily & I went to an exhibition at the Imperial Institute, South Kensington, & paid particular attention to the colonial & Indian part of it.  Unfortunately we were not full up with cash, so had to manoeuvre a bit: as a result, however, it was more enjoyable than ever         for it was funny & interesting to study the menu out in finding the cheapest way to get a feed.
