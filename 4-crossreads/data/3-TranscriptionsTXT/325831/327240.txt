8.old 26th Battn in Sydney & later of the 4th AIF is now acting as Brigadier to the 1st Bde.
He played in a football match against our battalion about two weeks ago. One enthusiastic young subaltern, during the game, had a violent little difference with someone who was hanging on to the ball & spoke his mind a little too expressively - to his subsequent horror he found he had been ill-using & abusing his Brigadier. I do not suppose there is any previous record in military history of a Brigadier taking part in a football match on active service.
Well pour le present, au revoir
With best wishes to Mrs & Miss Ferguson & yourself
I am
Yours very Sincerely
J L Flannery   1st Bn
