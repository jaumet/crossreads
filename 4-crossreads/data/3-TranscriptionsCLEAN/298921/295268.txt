  
 October, 1915 Sunday 24 [indecipherable] to Khediral O.Z. with Funnell riddled with bullets & shrapnel. Said goodbye to Skipper of good ship "Franconia" who never left the bridge for 3 days & nights & with the sun shining through the mist a good omen we steamed out for Anzac - Every man loaded like Father Xmas with all his earthly possessions. Arrived 6.30 p.m. unloaded into Barges, & reached our trenches at No.1 outpost on the left of Popes Hill with only one casualty.
