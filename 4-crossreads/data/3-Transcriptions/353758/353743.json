<p>7/6/15<br/>Arrived at Alexandria and was sent to Egyptian Government hospital there.</p>
<p>Above is a copy of short notes I made in my notebook from time to time but I have had to leave out a bit here and there. I got your letter with &pound;1 thanks very much. Also letters from Agnes Mirian [Miriam]. I expect to be out of there in a few days back in fighting again inside of a fortnight.</p>
<p>I have been remarkably lucky so far having had very close shaves times out of number. There is a lot of luck in it chaps have been shot dead right alongside of me but I have escaped so far. However there is a very long way to go yet. The Australian and New Zealand troops have done very well. Tell them all to write to me and let me know the news.</p>
<p>With love to all</p>
<p>Letter from Pvt Frank Makinson A Coy 13th Batt to his mother Mrs J. F. Makinson Neutral Bay</p>
