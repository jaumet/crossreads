 4/10/17 Ypres. De Knoet Fme On our track we passed a couple of dead 22nd. boys lying sprawled out on their backs &ndash; the familiar purple and red diamond showing up. Beside one was a thick gush of blood. Germans also lay about. About half a mile in was the group of pill boxes known as De Knoet Fme and for these we made getting winded and chased by shells. These were new places and some wounded men tried to crowd into them. My headquarters contained two occupants one was lying on the floor groaning of two wounds in the leg. He had lost a lot of blood. A German doctor came in later and dressed his wound. His cries and moans were all "Kamerad". After a couple of hours I saw the glaze of death in his eyes and gave him a drink of water. Later a series of moans was followed by the death rattle in his throat and we tossed the body outside with another one who had been bayoneted.
