<p>3/8/19 - <strike>Cape Town</strike> Chemnitz<br/>Much smoother but all the same too rough for church parades. Cold. We left 20 absentees at Cape Town. Carried out an inspection of the whole ship and found too many men down below in the decks. A following sea this afternoon and the wind drives showers of spray all over the ship. A dull night.</p>
<p>4/8/19<br/>Rain thrashing gray low waves this morning and on our port bow low land with breakers. Nothing exciting to record. In the evening taxation of bachelors provided a theme for the Diggers Parliament.</p>
<p>6/8/19<br/>Lovely sunny day with blue dancing white capped waves. After our Cape Town 12 hours ashore the doctor washed out 43 men. Today is one of the S.A. Union Peace holidays. The land in sight Natal</p>
