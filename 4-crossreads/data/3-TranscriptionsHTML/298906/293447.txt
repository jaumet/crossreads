<p>I think I rather surprised them by my pitching powers, but little did they think, that I had done a fair share of it, long before joining the Forces.<br/>21st. Today we have been doing musketry fire orders &amp; etc. practical work done on minature range.<br/>This afternoon we went out doing revolver shooting &amp; it rained fairly heavily, I scored 21 out of a possible 30 &amp; 12 out of 15 at the running man, second highest score, with a total of 33, then after that we were on the "range finder".<br/>22nd. Out on the revolver range again today, I must be improving for I got 13 out of a possible 15, we had to fire 1 shot at 10 yds then run up to within 5yds &amp; fire the remaining 5 in 7 secs</p>
