  
 during Summer months and if we are not in a "stunt" we are holding the line in some quiet spot - 
 I am expecting to go on leave in about 3 weeks now  Have a little programme mapped out including a few days in Ireland, but of course its such a total change to get over in England at all that I may decide to stay down with Sis - I will go down there for a few days anyhow - England is beautiful now from accounts of some of our fellows who have just returned including Percy Ross who spent most of his time down in Cornwall - 
 Maurice Fergusson is over on leave at present from my Battery. He returned to duty from Hospital much too soon so the rest was badly needed in his case.
