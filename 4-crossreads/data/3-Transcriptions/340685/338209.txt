<p>a very tumbledown village and nothing interesting. Also had a look at the church which contains a fine altar with a figure underneath to Joan of Arc. Am polishing my French here well. Got a Chronicle May 20 to-day but no letters. Bottle of wine between 4 of us for tea. Had a good hunt for insects and decreased their number a good bit and slept well though fitfully. Sunday. Issue of tobacco &amp; now have about &frac12; lb over.<br/>17.7.16 Little late for parade this morning. off all the rest as we are on duty pumping water for our horses and it is a very soft job. Been bustling round all the morning keeping things in order and have written this up. Last night we got some coffee in a house and had a good romp with some lads which were very interesting. Rained a bit last night and dull to-day. Could easily hear the guns at Naours. Had all the afternoon fixing things up and slept well that night.<br/>18.7.16 Given notice to leave that morning and we set out at 10 and had a stiff march until about 2.30 passing through Varennes and arrived <strike>about</strike> without having any dinner but we got some going about 3.30. Forceville is about 6 miles to the nearest point Thiepval of the firing line and Germans can shell here. Guns are going all the time. We caught an A.S.C. waggon into Acheux about 1 &frac12; miles away to try and get some fodder at the canteen but it was too crowded so we hurried back per motor wagon. We have rotten billets but got some straw after a hullabaloo with the occupants and are more or less comfortable. Got two letters one from Kath &amp; one from Eileen. It was raining pretty hard all night and just before we left and the road which led up hill and down dale was stiff and we had pretty few rests. Slept well last night although a bit crowded.<br/>19. Check parade at 6.30 and drill order at 8 in which all our stuff was taken note of to be made up and a further intimation of the time we were to have in front of us. Saw the ninth battalion go singing out to the trenches. Spent the day getting mobile and had a good wash. At 4.30 after tea at 4 we were given 20 minutes notice to leave and left at 5 going towards Albert where we arrived at about 7 (about 7 miles). Fair March and on the way we saw some interesting old trenches and dugouts in the hill sides. At Bouzincourt we had to stop for a while for traffic which is very heavy all along the road with all sorts of traffic and one way of conveying troops right up to the firing line is by London motor bus. There are many observation balloons all along the road observing which is hidden on the side of the hill. We saw one balloon being filled with gas from cylinders and it wasn't really so big as it looked when up. At Forceville we saw a parachute descending. We also saw 75 French shell cases and our own 18 pr and some bigger guns and trench mortars. On arrival we bivouacked in the open paddock as it was too dangerous to go right into deserted Albert which is always being shelled as there are some 12" guns scattered round about one right in the town. The fine cathedral has its spire smashed and has a golden</p>
