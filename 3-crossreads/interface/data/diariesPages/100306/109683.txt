Shelter Wood Camp 
3/2/17 A fine day and snow started to melt a bit. King lectured on the Lewis gun to all officers and I told them that they would be expected to strip and assemble the gun in 15 minutes. Ball shooting was carried out in an old trench. In the afternoon received orders to go up and reconnoitre the front line system. Left at 4 pm with Bellaway and up to 5th Bde with Fitzgerald. Roads very slippery and had several falls. Martinpuich is in ruins and is to be avoided. Reached BdeHQ and there saw Smith the General and after a little talk pushed on with runner over open ground to Colonel McKenzies H.Q. and had tea. Every officer present had a decoration of some sort. He had D.S.O. a Russian order and all others M.C.'s. After getting particulars returned, as we came back flares were going up in the bright moonlight and showing big glare alround. Some strafe 1 killed 1 wounded on Ration dump. Returned to camp about 10 pm. At 11 a heavy bombardment started and seems to be continuing. Orders to go by car to Abbeville with Colonel Bridges G.S.O. 1. Ink frozen in fountain pen
