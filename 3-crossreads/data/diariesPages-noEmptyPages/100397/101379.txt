My Dear Mother
I suppose you are wondering just where I was at present, well on Monday I called on Major Timothy Colbourne he gave me a note of Introduction to Warrant Officer at Victoria Barracks but that Gentleman could do nothing as the artillery was already filled, so I am at present in one of the Infantry Battalions, we arrived here on Monday about 3 P.M. and were sworn in after tea they do this now as soon as possible as men "a few of them when they get this far think better of it and do a slide, there are all sorts and conditions of men here some very decent fellows some the reverse. I was one of the lucky ones. "I had no friends in camp there were about a dozen more, "so we were picked out and 10 of us put into one tent, all the lads in the tent that I am in are fairly quiet steady lads and we get along well. I have the first part of my uniform. The Blues, they are a splendid fit, the trousers were made for a very fat man they would just suit the fat Boy at the Junction the flanells likewise, the cardigan jacket is a little better, the sox 3 prs are supposed to be all wool. they are not too bad, but I dont think they will last
