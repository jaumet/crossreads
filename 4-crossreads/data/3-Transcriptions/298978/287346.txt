<p>It was a relief to get ashore; we were packed so tightly in the boats and moreover so heavily laden with out kit that, had a shot hit the boat, we should have had no chance of saving ourselves &ndash; it was awful the feeling of utter helplessness.<br/>Meanwhile the Turks pelted us hot and fast. In jumping ashore I fell over, my kit was so heavy; I couldn't get up without help &ndash; fortunately the water was shallow at this point, otherwise-.<br/>It was a magnificent spectacle to see those thousands of men rushing through the hail of Death as though it was some big game &ndash; these chaps don't seem to know what fear means &ndash; in Cairo l was ashamed of them, now I am proud to be one of them though I feel a pigmy beside them.<br/>Wish there wasn't quite such a damned noise with the guns, it is sending me all to pieces &ndash; don't think I shall ever make a soldier.</p>
