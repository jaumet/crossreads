<p>Saturday May 22nd<br/>This morning I went on board the "Swiftsure" and saw Admiral Nicholson. I pointed out to him how extremely difficult it was for me to get my work done and sent off living on board the "Cornwallis" which was continually engaged in duties up the Striats.

However we only fired a very few rounds and then returned to our old anchorage. The armistice at Anzac lasted from dawn until about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and was scrupulously observed by both sides, not a shot being fired. A zone was established between the two lines, and it was arranged that the Australians should bury all the dead on their side of it, and the Turks all on their side, and that the rifles should belong to those in each zone. As a matter of fact the Australians and New Zealanders crept out dur-</p>
