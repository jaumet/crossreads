<p>hauled down.  We then steamed away and anchored at Direction Id for the night.</p>
<p>Next morning Tues 10th, we proceeded to the wreck and sent off boats to bring over prisoners and the wounded.  The swell was heavy and made matters difficult.</p>
<p>At the time when "Cease Fire" was sounded, the Emden was beached well up on Nth Keeling Id, a total wreck.  A more pitiable object in the form of a ship could hardly be imagined.</p>
<p>Early in the fight, our shells began to cause havoc on the "Emden".  Some of the survivors stated that in a few minutes her upper deck was cleared of gun's crews.  Stokers were driven up at the point of the pistol to man the guns. But either their inexperience or our gunfire prevented their doing us any further damage of any note.</p>
<p>One of the first shells which struck her flooded her torpedo flat, so that we were never in any danger from that quarter.  Also about the same time another shell damaged the steering gear</p>
