29/1/16.
I'm mess orderly today; I have to report to the "galley" four times during the day to draw the tucker for the chaps at my mess table. There is plenty of food on this ship and it is good. For example; todays menu ? Breakfast. Porridge (know to troops as "burgoo") Fried Meat Balls and Potatoes. Dinner Soup. Roast Mutton 3 kinds of vegetables. Stewed Fruit rice. Tea Bread,Butter Jam. Supper 9 P.M. Biscuits and Cocoa. Cheese. The orderlies are responsible for the cleanliness of the troop deck. As there is oceans of hot water everything is thoroughly scrubbed. General inspection by the Commander of the ship every morning at 11 A.M. It is very sultry down between decks tonight many of the fellows are going to sleep on the main deck. I am right along side a porthole and can get a breeze if I leave it open.
