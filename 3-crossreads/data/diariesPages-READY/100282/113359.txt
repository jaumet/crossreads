24th. The usual parades this morning plenty of organized games. Signed for our Australia books today wonder if they will ever get them. C D Coys officers played A B this afternoon after a very rough game beat them by 3 to nil.
25th. Sunday Church parade we held it in an old quarry, there was a regular hurricane blowing the wind was as cold as ice.
We had a fine dinner today roast fowl (don't ask questions as to where they came from) potatoes, turnips carrots parsnips, all salvaged by the troops, you cant beat the Australians for foraging. 
News came through tonight of the capture of Cambrai, some victory this latest one of ours, there is great jubilation in France over it.
Got a small batch of welcome letters this afternoon.
As I sit here writing I can hear the troops returning with the night
