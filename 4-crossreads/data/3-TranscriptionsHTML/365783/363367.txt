<p>in the museum is a marble figure of a bull.   This was discovered under Pompey's Pillar.  We had lunch at a very nice clean &amp; cheap Italian restaurant, the Star of "Italy".   After lunch we had a walk through the town &amp; took some photos in the native quarter.  A carriage was then taken out to Pompey's pillar &amp; the Catacombs.  We got back to the ship at 6 PM &amp; learnt that we were all to disembark at Alexandria &amp; that our unit was to be quartered at Mena House near Cairo.<br/><u>Sunday 17th January</u><br/>We came alongside of the wharf early in the morning &amp; commenced discharging our cargo.   We will probably be at Cairo for about two months &ndash; everything depends on how things turn out in regard to the Turkish invasion &ndash; from all accounts it is not likely to be a very serious business.<br/>I am sending this letter to London as you will be sure to get it there whereas it may miss you at any of the intermediate ports.   Later I will write &amp; let you know what our quarters at Cairo are like.  I have been keeping very well but at times get very bad attacks of homesickness.   Fred is also very well.   Very best love to the kiddies and your own dear self<br/>Yr. loving husband<br/>Will</p>
