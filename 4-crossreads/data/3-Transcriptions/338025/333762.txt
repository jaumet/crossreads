<p>Thursday 9th August 1917<br/>6.30 am Taube over camp dropped two bombs injuring Turner, Wilber Ashley. 4 horses and 10 donks were so badly injured that they had to be shot. Donks and horses were skinned and I was one of the burying party. Got them all buried by 5.30pm. The bombs made very small holes.<br/>1.30pm one of Fritz planes set fire to one of our observing balloons about 5minutes later our planes set one of Fritz balloons on fire.</p>
