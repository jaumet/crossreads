After midnight last night there was a very heavy fall of rain & on waking I found that the men had been drenched in most cases. There was water lying about in pools everywhere & presently blankets & other gear was spread out in all directions. On account of the wetting the Church parades were cut out.
About 10 o'c I was instructed to get ready to proceed to Cairo for 14 day's picquet duty & had to spend a good deal of time getting things packed up for early morning departure tomorrow.
After midday dinner went in to Pension Wales for afternoon tea, coming home for mess, afterwards going over to the Y.M.C.A. where a simple address was given & the usual old-time hymns sung. There was a very fair attendance.
