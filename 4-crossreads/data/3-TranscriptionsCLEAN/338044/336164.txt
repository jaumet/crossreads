  
 the Nile Bridge & gate on donkeys. This was a most pleasant Sunday afternoon  Had two days leave & visited Alexandria, staying at a small hotel at Mese, a suburb, overnight. A dip in the bluey waters of the Mediterranean I very much enjoyed. Thousands of refugees (women, old men    &  children) from Palestine, Greece &  Servia, are housed here,    &  I had the satisfaction of at least helping them to the extent of a few piastres.  [Noosbqa?] Gardens, a few miles away are very pretty. The town is small but comparatively clean, the big sea promenade with its great wall    & Ras el Tin Palace seen over the water is most picturesque
