  
 Friday, 13th November, 1914 Nearing Colombo the N.Z. troops went ahead to coal & water.  We will follow, but they will be finished before we are there.  The Melbourne escorted them. 
 The report is now practically confirmed concerning the beaching of the Konigsberg but by a British cruiser the Chatham. 
 I previously wrote that the Sydney had gone to Colombo now I learnt that she stopped with the Emden. 
 Saturday, 13th November, 1914 Mail Day, owing to strict censorship we are not allowed to divulge any name, date or place in our letters.  All this mail must be posted, unsealed, but we can write two letters and tell all the news in one this is held back at the authorities pleasure before forwarding.  I wrote one long letter for publication to home & one other, also one to E. 
 5 a.m. Sunday morn the Empress of Russia with the cruiser Sydney passed us returning to Colombo with their prisoners.
