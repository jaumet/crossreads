  
 26-2-17 Mon 26th Reveille at 5.30 & if one is slick enough it is possible to get a cup of tea & a wash before the parade at 6.15 had signalling work till 8.30 then dismissed breakfast at 8.45 & parade again at 9.30 till 1 P.M. dinner ten minutes later & parade again at 2.15 till 4 P.M. Anyone wanting leave after the days work is finished must have applications for leave in at 6 A.M. I did not apply this morning as I fancy I am better off without a pass; We had a passing in test this morning at 5 words a minute  & one must get 98% for a pass, a good many failed including  Olson & Pearson
