<p>in yesterday we saw two waiting to go out any time. Night &amp; day is just the same here as the shells are going over without a stop from thousands of guns as fast as they can load up. One thing we notice here &ndash; we are not subjected to the same rifle shooting &amp; snipping as to what we got South of Armentiers I must say I've never seen such big guns as they have here &ndash; We are all over mud &amp; in places have to wade through slush up to your knees &ndash; our feet are always wet &amp; cold &amp; only have the uniform we stand up in &ndash; our overcoats get wet &amp; muddy &amp; it is a load to carry them &ndash; as there is never enough sun to dry anything. Fritz must be getting hell. Had 1/5th of a loaf of bread &ndash; scrape of jam &amp; a 2 x 3 in piece of cheese for 24 hrs.</p>
<p>24/10/16  Tuesday</p>
<p>Very cold &amp; drizzling &ndash; Have &frac12; pint of tea &amp; left for the Aid post at 6.30 am &ndash; No rations issued found a tin of bully beef &amp; had a few iron biscuits &ndash; the only drinking water we get in out of shell holes. Was stationed at Mac Cormacks post, going strong all day &ndash; it is breaking all our hearts being always wet, short &amp; shabby rations &ndash; the heavy work &amp; slipping &amp; sliding everywhere. Incessant heavy bombardment &ndash; Fritz replying not too slowly</p>
