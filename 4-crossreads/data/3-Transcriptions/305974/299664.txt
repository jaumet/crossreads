<p>13 Monday<br/>There is word that the bombardment is from here right up to the sea on the whole of the western Front.  It is a very bleak day.  We are all packed up ready to go up into the trenches.  We left Ribemont about 1 pm &amp; marched to Dernancourt a distance of about four miles.  The roads were exceptionally muddy in places.  Received a letter from home &amp; one from Doris also a <strike>letter</strike> Parcel of cigarettes from O. Turner.</p>
<p>14 Tuesday<br/>My word the German prisoners are made work, road maintenance generally.  They seem to be well looked after though.  We fell in about 8 am &amp; marched to Longueval.  It is absolutely the worst march I have done in my life.  We had to contend with being blocked up with traffic, mud, etc.  We are now about 4 miles from the line.  Fritz put up a good few big shells on a hill about 300 yds away. As we were coming in I saw the Prince of Wales going back on a horse.</p>
<p>15 Wednesday<br/>One of the big shell burst in a tent belonging to the 13th Fld Amb. killing one wounding two.  It was an exceptionally cold morning this morning, nearly Freeze a person.  Fritz is still shelling the hill.  Detailed for road making all day.  We have to take about 15 inches of cloggy mud off the road &amp; put down metal, it keeps a fellow very warm this weather.  Everywhere about this place there is about 12 inches of mud.  Very cold evening.  Most of the fellows are living in huts I am in a dug out.</p>
