 a good fight was put up by each lad. The decisions given by the Referee was well received and each Winner was well cheered, in these Contests the Referee sat down on a raised platform and gave instructions, which was freely commented on by the boys, I always thought that a Referee's place is in the Ring with the Boxer's, but it was not so in this case. A fair number of the Boys returned by the Special to Pende for Tea returning again at 6.45Pm for the Cinema. The Hall was again packed and a good set of Pictures was shewn. A good Pinaist gave us several good tunes during the Evening and the boys joined in some singing &amp; others Whistling in between the Pictures great fun was caused by the Boys barracking one another and cheering all and sundry, a few Girls attended but I did not notice any W.A.A.C. Girls, their reception the night before was the cause of their absence. After the Show we all returned home after a first class day's outing which will always be remembered by the Boys.
