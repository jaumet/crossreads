Jan 30th  Lovely day again & no word of sailing. no hope of going ashore - we had no parades, spent the time lounging about watching the niggers & eating fruit - some of the boys dived off the deck into the water for a swim but were stopped on account of the number of sharks about -
 
Jan 31st  We hear that we are to sail on Friday. the weather is beautiful not too hot. & lots of fruit to eat. the paw-paws are beautiful - three sharks were seen cruising close to the boat - a party left the "Berimar" in a life boat & also we sent a party in a boat & they had a race - 
Feb 1st  Nothing special doing -
Feb 2nd  I was put on main guard in the morning (24 hour guard) We sailed at 2.P.M. Cornwall still with us. Whilst on my post at about 2 AM I saw Ursa Major (the great bear or dipper). & also the Southern Cross at the same time
 
Feb 3rd  The weather is getting cooler every day. my cobbers wouldn't believe that the S. Cross & the dipper could be seen together so I wakened them in the early morning & brought them on deck to convince them
