<p>Salisbury<br/>12.12.16<br/>My dear Sister,<br/>Just a line prior to returning to France. We are going to-night &amp; am in a way glad to get back to the Battalion again to see my old pals.<br/>I have had a darned good time whilst in England &amp; have thoroughly enjoyed myself.<br/>Will write as often as I possibly can to both you &amp; the Mater - I think my previous good luck will hang to me anyway I am not worrying much. I have grown to be an out &amp; out fatalist &amp; if I have to go under - well cheery-oh, a lot of future trouble is saved me.<br/>I will be a senior Lt</p>
