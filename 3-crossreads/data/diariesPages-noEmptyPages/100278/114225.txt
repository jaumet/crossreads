with water very rough.
4 days ago a big shell lobbed fair on one of the big huts blew it to smithereens luckily no one was in it, but yesterday things were not so fortunate, a shell landed in another hut which was crowded every man was killed 30 in all. Just here they have a wet canteen sell English beer stout 1 franc a pint I think they charge for it.
I have been very crook the last 3 or 4 days, every bone in my body aches I have a pet of a cold, but tonight I feel a little better, perhaps it is because we are back among our own Coy. The Sergeants are sleeping away from the men up here, we have a small hut or rather 2 of them to ourselves.
It has been very windy showery today, but no ways cold, but the ground thawing has made it very sloppy.
