up the whole ocean under these conditions looked almost black & oily.  She looked far from being the famous blue Mediterrean that poets sing of.  This morning all the clouds being swept away & the sun shining the ocean had quite resumed its well known hue, in fact I never saw it look so pretty & blue before if you were to mix as much Ricketts blue as water will hold it would be no bluer than the sea is today it is f in fact just lovely.There was were a couple of fights on board today, one between Wells & a Stoker, our chap won easily & a couple of other flutters.Have been writing steadily nearly the whole day have rattled off 18 pages of nonsense thank goodness I have nearly finished, only 1 more to write, am going to post them at Port Said.
