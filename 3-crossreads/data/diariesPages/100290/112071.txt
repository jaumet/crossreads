Monday
Night duty all last night. Felt pretty rotten weak. bays good I sleep most of night. Better in morning. Sleep all day benefit by rest. Ridgeway takes my place on duty tonight. We are due to go up the lines in a day or two. Terrific gale of wind all last night cold as Antarctica, then more rain. the ground has not been dry for over a month now.
