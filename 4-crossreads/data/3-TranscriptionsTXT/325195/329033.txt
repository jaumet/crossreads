12.12.15Sun 12thPut in my name for a Commission this morning but think I have a very poor chance of getting one, as Meredith is not likely to recommend any of his Signallers for anything, as the Regt. is not overstocked with them &he now  knows a Signaller cannot be replaced by everyone. D Battery shelled Snipers Nest again this afternoon, I was on duty on the 'phone & had an interesting time sending through the ranges from the Observation Officer the shooting was very good; 2 guns from every Battery has been taken away from here; the 4th LH left last night also a good many Infantry (7th Brigade;) & stores are being taken off the beach all day & night by pinnaces; Barbed wire entanglements put out tonight.
