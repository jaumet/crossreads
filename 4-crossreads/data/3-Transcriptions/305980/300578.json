<p>16:  Though we were supposed to be isolated for 21 days, we were ordered to saddle up &amp; move out with Brigade on a stunt.  Left at 10 a.m. camping at Junction station (15 miles) for the night.</p>
<p>17:  Left Junction at 9 a.m. reaching Zacharich  (where David is said to have slain Goliath) at 5 p.m., &amp; camped for the night.</p>
<p>18.  Left Zacarich at 6 a.m. &amp; after 10 hrs. riding through mountainous country, camped at El Khuddu , near Solomon's Pools, all containing tons of water.  The pools supply water to Jerusalem, largest being 200 yds. long 60 yds. wide &amp; 35 ft. deep.</p>
<p>19:  Left Khuddr at 9, riding through Bethlehem, which is a very pretty place, thickly populated.  Pushed on through the Judean hills, where our artillery had to be drawn  by men of the regt. owing to rough country.  Led our horses through these hills, the goat tracks only wide enough for one at a time in single file.  Reached El Munta at 10 p.m. 3 miles from Dead sea &amp; camped for the night.</p>
<p>20:  Stand to at 3 a.m. moving off at 9, leading our horses down the treacherous tracks, after 4 hours walking, we reached flat country at the foothills &amp; patrolled till 9 p.m. &amp; stood by in readiness all night.</p>
