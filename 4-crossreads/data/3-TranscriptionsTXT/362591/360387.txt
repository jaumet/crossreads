 Flanders 2nd April 1916 
 My dear Father 
 The last two letters I've written home are still in my pocket, on account of our latest move.  It's been a most interesting &amp; instructive move for me, as I was detached from the battalion with a hundred men &amp; four officers, &amp; have filled various posts.  Firstly on board ship I was in charge of all the infantry aboard &amp; about 200 horses, on the train from the landing to here I was O.C. train, when my French was very handy.  I was O.C. camp for one night at a certain town, &amp; was also Chairman of a concert.  The train job was by far the most worrying if not the most difficult.
