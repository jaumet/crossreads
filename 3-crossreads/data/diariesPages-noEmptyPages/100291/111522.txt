March Thursday 8 1917
No word yet of when we are to be relieved; on the other hand we have been attached to the 2nd Div, pro tem. Looks like as if we are in for some days yet. 
All are thoroughly tired of the long spell in the lines, no opportunity of a bath or change of clothes, the constant strain of being under fire tells on the strongest nerves. 
On duty at 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. Nothing much doing.
