We had to attend parades all the morning and then went on  Ward duty at two O'clock and remained on till ten at night. I succeeded in getting the week end and one night off and I spent them with Stirling.<br/> On Wednesday night we had a picnic just outside the show ground where Stirling was quartered, on a large ornamental knoll which made an ideal ground for the purpose. There were five soldiers present, counting ourselves, and of course the whole Sharpe family and several young ladies. We had a most enjoyable time. Stacks of good thing provided by Mrs. Sharpe were soon demolished by our combined efforts but even then there was enough over for each of us to take back to camp a goodly sized package of delicacies.<br/>On Saturday last Stirling and I had our photographs taken at the Crown Studios. We were taken both together and separate and will each receive one enlargement, half-a-dozen cabinets, and half a dozen post-cards, of each photograph (together &amp; separate). Ask Douglas whether he thinks I will have enough of them or had I better order another two dozen?<br/>As Stirling is leaving on Friday next I have been spending all my time off with him and consequently have not been to see any of the family for some time. I think I told you  I took Sterling over to see Grandmother and</p>
