<p>Saturday 22nd<br/>It rained the best part of the morning.  It wasn't too comfortable especially as we had to cook our own tucker.  We get a good issue of rations, including biscuits, bacon, tea &amp; sugar, beef, cheese &amp; jam, cigarettes, tobacco &amp; matches.  After dinner we marched out.  By good luck our Squadron was attached to the Battalion Alf Outridge is in &amp; we were in the trenches with them at 6 oclock.  The Turks started their usual burst of firing, but made no attack.  They fire to keep us from attacking.  We came out again at 6 oclock into the rest trenches.</p>
