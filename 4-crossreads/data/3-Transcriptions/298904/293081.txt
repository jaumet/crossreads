<p>The coast of France was sighted on the 27th &amp; all the mountains we could see far away in the distance were snow capped &amp; very pretty they looked for the sun was shining brightly on them, the coast of France from a distance looks a most uninviting place, but as we got closer &amp; closer to it how the scenery changed, we could see lovely parks of trees stretching far up the hillside &amp; green fields everywhere, Spring was fast coming in on the South of France, &amp; she was beginning to look bonzer, everyhere &amp; there you would see an old castle perched on some rocky eminence overlooking the sea a relic of the olden days</p>
