place & also the Hostel frequented by the Quakers. Stopped inside & yarned during the afternoon the man driving us to the station for the 6.30 P.M. train to London. From here Will went onto Scotland having got an extension of leave & I promised to run up later. That night I stopped in the Hotel yarning & enjoying the lounge. Found letter from friend Ramsay announcing his arrival in London & to meet him next morning at 10 A.M. Weighed myself, result just under 12 st.
Thursday 11th Jan.Went to meet Ramsay at 10 but he did not turn up untill 11 A.M. having made a mistake in the time, a very unfortunate thing for me as I was up late & had to rush away without breakfast or a shave. We had lunch in The Strand, booked seats for the Opera "Young England" & later returned to the Hotel for tea. The show turned out to be very good, the theme, Sir Francis Drake being a stirring one & the music being splendid. Saw
