 12 August 1918 Monday On train for Palestine again, drove straight from Hospital to train of course little wife very upset at my going but she is a brave little girl &amp; we are very happy Mother together-   I think this war makes us all more lenient &amp; tolerant to each other. Had Baby vaccinated before I came away poor wee soul she is a bonnie wee girl. I never received the Pastoral Times cutting with my notes re Jerusalem I should like to read it again please.
