  
 time table from Uncle Fred at Barrow. 
 Wednesday, 11/4/17 Rained heavily during night making parade ground very slushy & slippery.  Half day off in afternoon as going on picquet at 6.30 p.m., consequently missed a route march.  About 9 p.m. party of men off "Wiltshire" arrived in camp. 
 Thursday, 12/4/17 Heavy fall snow during night.  Paraded sick with a cold, but not much satisfaction with it.  Feel just as bad as ever, even after taking dose medicine & having throat painted.  Received letter from Uncle Charlie in London.  Had to parade sick again at 5 p.m. feeling very crook - temperature 102.
