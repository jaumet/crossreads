The soldier were swarm round the Froggi newsboy like a favourit at Randwick , all eager to read the war news , as those in it know less of how the war is go than those over in England who read the cabl each day . I tramp to 3 canteen tri to get someth to eat , but they were all shut . 6 Aug. I struck an escort job , had to take a "bird " from the clink in Riveri to Bn . Headq ?rs , had a privat with me . The coot expect us to walk the 8 kilo to La Neuvill evid ? it 's a love armi ? but we manag to strike a Tommi motor lorri later an Aussi G.S. wagon , that took us part of the way .

Five of us set off on our long trip up to Bn . this morn . We got separ , the traffic on the road is simpli enorm , lorri in thousand , it is go to be a tremend stunt . We got a lift up the road as far as an ambul car was go walk along blow if I did n't strike Cobcroft sit by the waysid . He is a Lieuten in the 1st Bn . ? the 1st Divis has just come down south after a long stay on the northern French front . He was ask after Boo . Final , after various term of walk , a ride on a differ transport , I arriv a Vair where the B?n are . All issu , ration , bomb , etc . are be complet in prepar for the great stunt to be launch tomorrow . A letter from Gener Monash was read , say it was the first time the whole of the 5 Australian Divis have gone into battl togeth , the biggest thing they have yet been in . A Canadian Corp will be on one flank of us 2 English Divis on the other , tank , aeroplan artilleri will be in a coloss scale . Lt . Parsonag explain the part our platoon of D Coy have to take . Oh well , one can onli trust in Provid . Our Vair Wood Hamel stunt on 4th Juli will be a babi to this . The weather is fine today , it 's hard to realis it 's the eve of a veri big battl . I got my gear readi at 8 p.m. , then read Boo 's letter the " Daili Mail" . Ear in the morn , hell will be let loos . Had a lie down in my cloth at 9 p.m. , had a snooz till 1 a.m. , when we had breakfast . Thursday 8 Aug. At 2 a.m. we fell in , march to the point of assembl . Went through the murki street of a villag , then along a road , line up in ling wet grass . Everyth was quiet , about 3.30 sudden the barrag crash down . The 3rd Divis move off ahead of us , they are to go 4.000 yard to dig in , then our brigad go on a further 2500 yard , the 16th B?n will then go through us for a further 2500 yard , so it 's a big affair . Well , soon after we start it felt as if the worst would happen , owe to the weather . We had hard move off when a heavi fog came down it look as if the weather would ruin all hope of success . ?Plane could not fli , the tank would be lose their way , troop could hard keep in touch with each other . You could onli see chap about 5 yard away on either side , I trembl for the 3rd Divis move into the unknown , as they could see a Fritz possi till they were right on to it . Howev , it would be as bad for Fritz , as he would n't see them till they were right on top of him . Hope it would lift , we trudg on in the fog through grass , occasionlli a wood or crop . Then we came to a road were pleas to see our tank come along then a cheer went up as a group of Fritz prison went back along the road . I saw no dead Fritz or ani sign of a struggl it look as if he had nick off . At last the sun faint appear , the light got brighter , we came to the 3rd Divis dig in , they gave us a smile a cheer as we move on . Tank were with us , on we went down sunken road up steep bank , till we were clean knock up from our long tramp with the infern load up . Could see Fritz run back , then I saw a coupl of hors lie dead in a wagon They were horribl knock about . It look as if we could walk right to Berlin , we still encount no opposit . Then some Hun shelter , hors stabl came on the scene , about 50 Fritz put their hand up , hurri eager to the rear . Our chap took anyth worth have as souvenir . We climb anoth hill , were near on our object line , when we struck Hun machin gun in a sunken road , they pour a fire on to us made it live . I saw 2 run away about 400 yard off , had the satisfact of bring one down as he ran . Our O.C. Capt . Geari ( onli made captain a few day ago ) was shot dead , he was a fine old chap the boy all call him " John " . Then a coupl of tank went down , a lot of Hun came run back with their hand up . Jerri Saxton was that wild he turn his Lewi gun on to some of them . They had just kill John Geari near him . Poor Ted Curley was kill too , no stretcher bearer handi to take him away , he bled to death . The 16th B?n now push on further ahead we dug ourselv in : He was put shell over now , sever were be hit . Lor ? we were tire , at 3p.m . we actual had to move up to the front line anoth mile a half . As some of the Lewi gun section had been knock , I had to lump a pannier full of ammunit as well as my other infern load . That mean we ll have no sleep tonight , we re dead beat now . When we got up we found the 16th B?n . had suffer heavi casualti . from machin gun shell . come up , owe to the Tommi o n the flank have been held up . It is aw to see the dead , bad wound lie about , wish the aw affair would soon end . I kept fall asleep as I stood look over the parapet tonight . There was a veri old trench which we made use of , thank the Lord it was here , as I do n't know how we would have dug one . The night is fine to luckili , otherwis we ?d get wet through , as we carri neither greatcoat nor waterproof in the attack . About 11p.m . our weari bodi were reviv by hot tea stew which came up . It was a God send , awaken us up a bit . At midnight I had to take a work parti to dig a strong point , a pioneer offic point out the spot . Needless to say the tire chap did not dig much . One of our chap was lie dead near a knock out tank , I got the sand bag off his back --- they will be handi to lie down on in the trench . Friday 9 Aug. Oh well , the long night end at last , ration were issu at daylight . They were good , a tin of cocoa milk to 2 men , Tommi cooker , biscuit , the usual bread jam . Fritz did n't counter attack last night , thank Good . I lay down on sand bag on the bottom of the trench : ( there are no sleep possi dug in , of cours ) slept till 3 p.m. , then made a drink of cocoa on Tommi cooker had a snack . A lot of Fritz 's black cross ?plane came over spi us this afternoon . It is a love day , the weather is kind so far . In the even a tremend barrag was open on the ridg to our left , I watch the white smoke from the burst shrapnel . Our side must be advanc there . Then we got order to be prepar to move at a minut 's notic , so perhap we ll have to advanc again dig in . Lor ? it want men of cast iron for this game . No. 14 platoon was split up between 13 and 15 , so we onli have 2 platoon . I am in charg of No. 2 section , 8 men . Well , at 11 p.m. when we were all feel tire , worn out and hungri , anxious await the hot stew tea , we got word to put all our gear on prepar to move forward . We had to move on anoth 800 yard to where the 16th B?n should have gone the first day , but owe to opposit their own support tank be knock out , they could n't get there . We start off tire hungri , were told the ration would come on behind us , we ?d get them in the new trench . I did n't care about this night adventur in unknown countri in dark , with no artilleri support , but they count on a peac penetr , that Fritz had gone further back . Sati 10 Aug We went further along an old sap in singl file for some distanc , then along a road , then turn into anoth trench , came out sat besid a sunken road for some time , await the etern order . Final we move on , had n't gone far , when some said " Look out , Fritz is here . " We lay down quick , were near an old trench , which some got in , we peer into the grass look for the Hun . Then of his murder machin gun began spit out fire , we were proper held up , to move on would have meant death against those machin gun hidden in the long grass in the dark look for the Hun . Then two of his murder machin gun began spit out fire , we were proper held up , to move on would have meant death against those machin gun hidden in the long grass in the dark . Lt . Player call out for Cpl . Stewart his Lewi gun , Paddi Stewart fire his Lewi gun into the direct the Hun was fire from . Then I was put in a sap with anoth chap to guard against anyon come along it . It was a ticklish job , as when I look along the next corner it was almost imposs to see whether ani Boch were there or not . Anyway I was feel far more like a sleep or some thing to eat , than box on with the Hun . I kept sneak on from corner to corner , at last came to a dead end , found the sap is not occupi by Fritz . Then I heard poor littl Jimmi Stewart was kill ? our chap were fire grenad tri to knock his gun out , amp good old Jack Gosper while fire a rifl grenad was hit in the head by a bullet from the German machinegun , &mp ; his skull split open , so that anoth good corpor was kill . Ted Hugget came into the sap to tell me , the next thing was that he too , while stand abov the trench to fire a grenad was kill . Is n't it aw ? then a bit came our way , as Lt . Player got a grenad on to one of his machin gun , knock it out , went through it in . Two Fritz were dead near it , one near dead . My mate I were almost too tire to stand up look over the top , it was a relief when daylight came at last , the night was over . Ration were issu amongst them a littl tin fruit from the comfort fund . We did day watch , an hour each in turn , lay down in the bottom of the trench had a sleep. Thank Good the weather hold good ? if it rain we ?d be in a bad way with no coat . Our artilleri was shake his local up today plane of both side were up . I was put on listen post tonight with 3 men , it was hard an enjoy job . Our post was on the edg of a road , opposit it a Fritz sap ran up to the road we were gaze across had to look on either side in the long grass . We could hear a big crowd of German talk , the clang of tool , evid a wire parti . A" flare king " fire a flare I could hear a Hun whistl anoth one whistl in repli . We fire some rifl grenad into the direct of the sound , Thank Good he did n't rush up the sap with machin gun , or he would have got us . At 11p.m . the 41st Bn reliev us , we were wearili march out of the line . Oh Lor ? what a terribl walk we had . God know how we did it , our feet were all terribl sore , it was a terribl distanc . We left the line about midnight had to go to Bn Hdq 's in a sunken road to have our tea stew but on this new front our offic did n't know the way we got lost , amp tramp all over creation . It look as if we ?d never get there , we tramp tramp lump our rifl various gear . The offic ask if anyon knew the way , but no one did . At last , after climb embank , tramp across grassi ground we struck it . Had hot tea stew hurri amp ; had to set out on anoth hellish long tramp . Our feet were terribl sore , amp ; did n't they ach . It was a clear night Fritz 's ?plane were up , one drop some bomb which burst with an aw deafen crash not far from us . This part of our tramp was along the road , we went through a villag , talk about knock about ! I have seen some batter villag in Franc , but this beat all . It was batter to a pile of rubbish ; I suppos befor the advanc Fritz was in it . On we tramp , the chap were sing out , Go slow , what about a spell . At last , about 5 hour ? tramp brought us to our halt place , there were n't enough shelter sever had to doss outsid . They had no coat or waterproof , after sweat on the long march must have been veri cold in the night . Sunday 11 Aug I got under a low tarpaulin shelter with two stretcher-bear , we soon lay down had a sleep for a coupl of hour till breakfast , after which we had anoth sleep. We read the account of the big advanc in the " Daili Mail " ; strang thing , that up in the battl you have to read the newspap to know how it is go on . It was a great victori , the advanc be 9 mile . In the afternoon we had a dip in the river a few mile away , it was most refresh to our tire , hot bodi . It is a cheer spot we have come out of the line to , sever dead hors lay around , in a trench here I saw one of the most fright sight I have seen in the war . Good know everyth about it is ghast enough . The Tommi here had a veri rough time , did n't have a walk over like on our sector --- in fact befor the big stunt start , they were attack by Fritz , had to win back that ground befor the big battl , in the face of heavi opposit . In a trench we saw 4 Tommi lie dead in full equip , two had their head blown off . A corpor was in front , they were evid just advanc along the trench with the corpor as the lead , a sort of littl advanc parti , or patrol , when a shell came got them all . They lay on their back dead , one behind the other , a grim spectacl of war 's horror . If some of these brute make money out of the war could see the sight , it might make them asham . Our chap buri them , also the dead hors lie around . The greatcoat waterproof which we dump befor the attack came up tonight ; we had a good night 's sleep. I wrote up this diari , read the " Daili Mail " till 11 p.m. , then we nt to sleep. Had to blow out the candl I was read by at differ time , when Hun 's ?plane could be heard drone overhead . Monday 12 Aug. Had a nice easi day rest , we are all feel much better . We are paid today , the canteen did a good biz . At night Hun ?plane came over drop bomb around . I wrote a long letter home today . Tuesday 13 Aug. Was order corpor today . We went down for a hot bath chang of cloth this afternoon , then got the rotten news we are to do anoth stunt in a day or two on the Harbonnier sector . We have to captur a wood . By Jove , they are make it hot , we ll have hard ani men left soon . Oh well , I shall hope pray for the best , as usual . One can onli trust in Provid . Well these head ought to be goal the way they treat men . It 's enough to put a man off fight for his countri . We fell in at 5.30 p.m. , think we ?d have a nice easi march this even , a good rest befor go in the line tomorrow night for the stunt . We walk along a road thick with dust cover with militari traffic . On we went through a villag where three dead hors were lie on the road . Lor ? talk about hum , they near turn us up . We tramp on on , it got dark , still we trudg on , with the weight of our pack pull our shoulder down , our feet get sore again . Pass through a villag batter to piec , like a mighti rubbish heap , not one build was left , with a roof or wall stand . The chap were aw disgust , it is red hot , after a big stunt to have to march like this , to go straight on for anoth . At 10.15 p.m. we got to our rest place ? there were n't ani dugout to sleep in no shelter as we had neither greatcoat nor blanket with us , we simpli had to lie down in the bottom of an old trench with just a waterproof sheet , freez all night . Some Fritz ?plane came over , our searchlight pick 2 of them , they held them in their ray like silver bird , our anti-aircraft Lewi gun blaze away at them , but they are hard to hit they got out of the light , away . Wednesday 14 Aug. It was too cold to sleep with no cover last night a chap is n't refresh for the fray . What do the head care anyhow . Won't we all be happi when it 's all over . The sun was blaze down all day it was jolli hot , lie in an open trench with no overhead cover . We were told today the stunt was postpon indefinit but we are to reliev the 9th Bn . in the front line tomorrow night . I slept warmer tonight , an artilleri chap from a dugout near gave me 2 blanket . Fritz 's ?plane woke me up at time , &mp ; our searchlight got them in their ray at time , the gun open out , but they got away again . Thursday 15 Aug. I wrote to Barrett , now a Major with D.S.O. , today ask him to get me back to my good old 3rd Bn. , where my alway has Been , where all my good mate of Egypt Gallipoli day were . I hope to Good the transfer can be fix up . At 8 p.m. we fell in to march up the line . It is aw to be go up so shorthand . We are not even up to half strength . The 14th Battalion went past while we were set down , no one could imag a more tire , fed-up crowd . They were less in number than we were , that say enough . There are some hard doer in the A.I.F. alright . Some chap in addit to their heavi gear were carri a shovel , one of our cove said " Are you go dig mate ? " In a disgust voic the 14th Battalion chap said " Our ape would make you carri one of these to Pari on leav . " There were two offic just in front of him as he call it out . It was a long tramp up to the line . We pass number of dead hors , which "pong " terribl . The traffic on the road a mile or two from the line was thick . Troop ? Australian Yank ? were go both way suppli galor on limber . If Fritz could have seen it , he?d have put some shell there done some damag . We eventu reach our front line at 11 p.m. the 9th Battalion went out . We were lucki to get in without be shell , as he was drop them at our part of the ground right up to the time we had to pass that veri spot ? the luck of war , eh ! He shell a wood to the right of us veri heavili in the night , has plenti of gun here . Other pass overhead pepper shot behind us , but luckili none came close to our compani . Our trench is a rotten one ? it is an old 1916 line is veri shallow , too wide for anyth . Shell could easili fall in it . I was glad when night at last end , daylight brought the chanc to sleep. All hand were on the alert at night , daytim is the time for rest . Friday 16 August No proper dugout , the hot sun soon hunt Forster me out of the one we dug. It was too hot to lie in sleep. Shell are shriek whistl whine , sing ( accord to their size the distanc they are go ) over our head today . Some go over to the Hun line , some back to our rear , Keep up the music-; the front line as usual is best place for shell , Fritz put them further back . Piti help us if he shell us here ; the trench is veri wide ? no dugout veri shallow . We lay up against the back of the trench , tri to sleep in the littl bit of shade that lay on the perpendicular edg about noon . The night turn out jolli cold , seem terribl long ? it seem an age befor it was daylight , we could stand down at 5 a.m. The stew at 11 p.m. the tea bacon at 2 a.m. made a bit of a break in the long night . In between time I gaze over the top into the dark of No Man 's Land , doze off , gaze , gaze look at my watch . Saturday 17 August We move forward a further 600 yard today . The trench here are all the old 1916 line , we along sap which no Fritz seem to inhabit . Our offic 2 new one-star artist did n't seem to know where we had to go , we sat down for half an hour await order . Thank the Lord fritz did n't attack or shell us . The manag is rotten , we were all sit down with our load of ammunit bomb like lost sheep. At last they decid we still had to go further , so down the shallow trench we went with head bent . Various German gear lay about ; helmet stick bomb etc . We were sat down , then my section had to move around further to take up a part of the trench till the 14th Battalion get up . it is a terribl possi , sap lead off everywher , a chap never know who is in them . The trench was full of German stick bomb German rifl ammunit ( box of it ) it is quit evid the Hun were here a veri short while ago . All the rifl were load I saw some cigar lie about some with fresh ash on them . The brute might be in some dugout sleep today , come here to night . There are so mani sap one will have to be veri alert . Just befor dark his artilleri open out on one of our new posit , the coot must have seen us move in . he gave us a veri nasti half hour of shell , luckili none drop right on us , but they were shriek toward us burst with an aw roar , front , right left . It is wonder how mani shell burst without hit anyon . It was a long dreari night again . We were deepen the veri shallow trench to make it a bit safer to walk along , as our head shoulder were abov the top : stew at 10 p.m. , amp bacon tea at 1 a.m. amp dig watch at last end the night . Sunday 18 August A Brigad on our left were have a hop over to advanc their line a few hundr yard , sudden at 4.30.a.m . the artilleri barrag crash down . The flare king out in No Man 's Land sent up their flare , the Hun machin gunner open up , his myriad color light began to go up . I was watch Fritz 's beauti display of firework , green flare , red one , white amp ; yellow were be fri up . Our side never use flare , we have no need to , as his light up No Man 's Land for both of us . We were n't move forward so I stood at the parapet watch our shell burst Fritz 's love flare signal . Then his artilleri got to work , we all had to huddl in the bottom of the trench , or against the side , as they burst with an aw roar behind us . there are no dugout in the trench for protect , the shell roar round us , but none of our lot were hit , though the 14th Battalion on our left must have had some casualti , as big black mass of smoke from burst shell rose right on their trench . After half an hour of this agoni the shell ceas , at daylight we turn in to rest . The hole Forster I dug was n't wide enough , we were jam like sardin , it was so tight a squeez that I could n't scratch myself where the chat were bite my leg . A Fritz plane came over as soon as it was daylight to see where we were what had happen dure the night . It is a dreari , rotten exist . I lay down in my cloth for a while , did my turn at lookout , had a " chat " caus mani loss , the day drag on to night . Shell are pass over our head in both direct , both to from the Hun , carri lump of iron . We had some cruel luck tonight . About midnight a shell burst on the trench . Kill Danni Morgan , the corpor Warren , of the Lewi Gun section , wound Lt . Hall , Lt . Rose , Smith Ealey . Lt . Rose is O.C. of A Coy . was have a look over the trench as his compani are to reliev us tomorrow night , he Lt . Hall were walk past at the time the shell burst . Danni Morgan was walk past where I was , carri the ration for his section , I ask him if he?d take some bread to two of my section further up . I gave him the bread he drop it , then he said " Put it under my right arm . " As he walk off , someon said " If a shell come Danni will drop the lot " . Not mani minut afterward , after some shell had burst , a chap came down for the stretcher-bear , true enough , Danni had been kill when he had cut the ration up to hand round . God , it 's a curs game ; it 's a piti someth would not end this aw roar . Lt . Hall was groan as the stretcher bearer carri him past me on a stretcher . Monday 19 Aug. The night drag on , till at 3.30 a.m. Fritz open out with his artilleri , for 40 minut we got hell . Luckili the shot were pass just over us , it was cruel to hear the big shell shriek toward you burst around . The light was misti , it was veri hard to see if he was come at us ? anyhow a man had to keep his nut down to stop be hit by the fli bit of shell . Most of us had the "wind up " , but we stuck it , I look over the top to see if the Hun was come besid Sam Hensbi on his Lewi gun . At stand down we turn in , but at 10 a.m. a Hun bombard made us hop up ?a day bombard was most unusu late , they pour over in a mighti roar . The poor old 14th Battalion seem to be get them fair on their trench , but they either fell in front of , or just behind our compani . We look into No Man 's Land our artilleri sent over plenti of shell too , but thing gradual quieten , we lay down to tri get a sleep onc more . I took the boot off my tire feet , was doze off , when his shell open up again we had to " stand to" . The rotten brute is spoil our sleep ? wonder what he has in view . At 9 p.m. we " stood to " as usual for the night , about 10 his shell began to strafe us again . It is an aw feel to be under a heavi bombard . No matter who the man is , he is more or less frighten , despit the rot one read in newspap . The aw roar of the burst shell rang in our ear , death was rain down , yet no one was hit . They were lob just over our trench ; mani gas shell were among them , though there was not enough gas to make us put our respir on , it made us sneez . A piec of shell whizz into the trench , hit me on the big toe . Lor ? it stung , but it was n't a " Blighti " wors luck . Dure the night some reinforc arriv , new hand to trench life ? we told them to start dig a sleep "possi " for themselv in the day time . Fritz was fair quiet dure the night with his artilleri , sent some gas over . Tuesday 20 Aug. Slept till noon , then did my hour 's lookout had a snack . Heat some tea on a " Tommi cooker" , fri my issu of chees . It was veri nice fri moist on bread . At 3p.m . I came back with 7 other from the compani . We walk through the sap to Battalion Headquart and report there , then set off for the nucleus at the rear for a spell . We first of all made for rear Battalion headquart . Fritz did n't let us depart without some part shot , drop some shrap behind us as we went on . All along the rout ( which befor the attack on the 8th was occupi by the Hun ) we saw German helmet gear of all sort . We got to the cooker had tea there . I drew our next day 's ration , at 8p.m onc more set off , bound for La Neuvill , near Corbi , where the nucleus are . We had alreadi walk a long way but this was the limit . More dead with fatigu than aliv , we walk walk , got in two motor lorri for a short while , but otherwis had no lift , walk the whole way . A lorri took us a few kilo into the town ( or what 's left of it ) of Viller Bretonneux , it was a veri strang sensat , as we pass the spot where we had such a rough time last May . As I look on the scene of our trench there , where shell use to fall thick , thought of the aw time we had carri ration through it all , it seem strang that all could be so quiet now . It show how far we have push the Hun back late . We set off for Corbi from Viller Bretonneux , Lord , were n't we tire footsor . We went past familiar spot where we use to put up barb wire , dig , tc. now well clear of Fritz . A lorri took us about a kilo to Corbi , then we walk to La Neuvill , final hit our destin at 12.30a.m . Think of that , you cold-foot " stay at home " , start walk at 8 p.m. , finish at 12.30a.m. , yet we were out to have a rest . Civilian who have n't done these armi tramp , lump rifl , equip gear , can have no idea of the utter weari we felt . We had to get ani shelter we could , 5 of us got under a tarpaulin . We onli had waterproof sheet , no greatcoat or blanket , lay down in our cloth . Golli , it was cold . Wednesday 21 Aug. There was n't enough breakfast for those who came down in the night , but I manag to get some porridg tea from the band who are here too . It is a scandal , the band never go in the line , nor do they fight , or even do fatigu work . After breakfast we had the luxuri of a shave , as I had n't had a shave or even wash my face for a week , it was some oper . There was a bath parad which I glad went on . We march up to Corbi to the militari bath , had a hot shower chang of cloth . We all stood under the hot shower , and soap soap , the trench dirt just roll off us , especi our head . It was a perfect treat to feel clean again ; walk back to our camp , the etern militari traffic was pass through the street , the smell of petrol from the motor lorri which pass by unceas day night , was vile , everywher was dust . Went down a narrow lane full of motor lorri , into which Tommi were shovel metal from railway truck . There was hard room to squeez past , I do n't know how the driver got them there . It was bonza to see a train steam along the line , anoth sign of the push back of the Hun . A fortnight ago , a train here would have been blown to piec by the German artilleri . In the afternoon I lay on the grass in the shade had a sleep. It is a treat to have a quit lie down after the last rough fortnight . After tea I wrote up my diari , then Draper I walk up the road look for a blanket , our luck was in . As we were pass a shed , a chap sang out to some fellow lie around " This way for your blanket " , so we just walk in drew one each with this unit . Luck eh ! Six of us slept under the tarpaulin shelter had a good night 's sleep. It was a love moonlight night . 22nd August I got a nice Aussi mail this morn , letter from home , Newcastl More , then I was warn to go with two men as escort to bring back a desert . We were veri disgust , just out of the line for a spell , have to tramp after these brute that clear out . My instruct were to report to the A.P.M. at Viller Bretonneux . It would take too long to describ our devious rout to that spot , it was a fear hot day , the white dust from the militari traffic was thick , I piti some Tommi work on the road like convict in the heat dust . Found the 4th Divis A.P.M. heard that the "bird " was not there , so we jump on a lorri came back to Corbi . Tuesday 27 Aug. The whole brigad have come out for a rest at last we went join the rest of the 13th Battalion in a villag call Poulainvill . We got a lorri as far as Pont-Noyell , so we rode to there , then tramp on to Querrieu , where we got anoth lorri to Allonvill it took us on to within a coupl of kilo of Poulainvill . We found the battalion billet in barn in the villag . As usual in all French villag the church stand high abov everi other build , is easili the best . Even if it 's a small villag in Franc , the church is alway a good build with a high spire stick up is visibl for mile around . I am in a littl barn with 10 chap , slept in the straw , it was warm comfort with a blanket . Oh well , the 4th Brigad the 13th Battalion particular have suffer pretti sever in these big attack against Fritz dure the last six week but our loss are light compar to what we ve dealt out to him . His prison alon exceed our casualti . As this big advanc has continu on all front , day by day with our , it is evid to all of us that the war has complet swung our way at last , the German menac seem at last to have it back broken . Who would have thought last April May such a sudden chang would come over thing ? The Aussi have more than done their bit in this great push ? just on our own sector prison constant pour back we advanc a terrif distanc sinc it first began . We have lost some grand men though , part of war 's hellish price . God grant , there may never be anoth one on this earth ! Our brigad are all out for a thorough well earn rest , but there are French , English Yank galor to carri on the big advanc unceas Fritz will get no respit . Sati . 31 Aug. I have been veri crook late with diarrhoea pain in the stomach , was sent today in a motor ambul to the 61st Casualti Clear Station . There are 3 wound Hun in the ward I 'm in , to complet the mixtur , a tall Indian came in . Thursday 5 Sep. Arrive by hospit train at Rouen , was taken to No. 10 Gener Hospit . The advanc goe on on all sector Fritz is get the hell he deserv . The whole of the Aussi divis are to have a long spell , so I wo n't be destin to see ani more German stoush firework . Our number are so small now that I think the head have brought our chap out becaus they re too weak to carri on without be reorganis sever battalion have been cut out altogeth . This Rouen front , on which I conclud this diari , is certain more cheer than that celebr "health resort " , Viller Bretonneux where I pass so mani excit moment , where gas shell were as plenti as rabbit in N.S.W. I am truli thank to be aliv sound as I close this off . C.M.G. 13th Bn . [ Transcrib by Lyn William , Judi Gimbert , Adrian Bicknel for the State Librari of New South Wale ]
