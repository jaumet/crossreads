 Sunday 10 October, 1915 
 Disembarked at 11.30. 
 Took some more interesting snaps &amp; saw a submarine in dry dock but couldn&#39;t get a photo of it. 
 Cigarettes &amp; matches were given us as we came ashore also some milk. 
 We were put in a motor ambulance &amp; then followed a drive of about &frac34; of an hour right across the island to St Georges Hospital. It was a lovely spin &amp; all the roads are perfect so we were able to go at a good pace. 
 The hospital we are in was formely a barracks &amp; it is very comfortable. 
 I am in Ward B2. 
 There is some great scenery here &amp; I am anxious to get loose amongst it with my camera.
