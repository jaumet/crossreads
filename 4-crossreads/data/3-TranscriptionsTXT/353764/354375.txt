 wind that would cut you in two.  Played Cricket &amp; in consequence of same am feeling very stiff.  Was disappointed again to-day there being no mail for me.  This is the fourth day but hope to get some to-morrow. To-day I witnessed a Strange burial system viz &ndash; the funeral rites of a Native.  First of all they dig a hole underneath a big Cement tomb.  The whole village turn out &amp; march in the front of the Corpse. The undertakers then come along carrying the corpse in a kind of box fixed onto 2 long shafts which the Natives carry on their shoulders.  The Corpse is wrapped in a kind of Cheese Cloth &amp; then put in the hearse.  When they reach the grave side they take the Corpse out, wash the face, close the Cloth Cover up &amp; put it straight into the grave.  This is then covered up &amp; the Cortege moves away.  There is no religious ceremony of any kind.  Every kind of animal turns out to a funeral, from a Camel, Donkey, etc. to a Mule.  Turning in now for a sleep.
