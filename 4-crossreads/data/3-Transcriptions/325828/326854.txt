<p>My dearest Father,<br/>After ringing you up on Monday afternoon I went back to Ol's, &amp; about 10 minutes later the young lady herself came in.  She was looking very tired &amp; had had a heavy day in town.  She was very bright otherwise &amp; was glad of my company for the short time I was there.  - Naturally I was very disappointed at having to throw the job up at that stage, but I was very sorry for your account, Father dear, for I knew you would be disappointed too on my a/c.<br/> Everything went splendidly till I was passing St Leonards when I felt the tyre go down- the back one at that which was so tight to get on.  A mile or so further on I thought I would take a short cut to the water's edge &amp; so round to the ferry, thus avoiding the trams &amp; main traffic.  I had gone about 1 &frac12; miles when I found my way hopelessly blocked, &amp; had to retrace my steps.  Even then I was at the foot of a long hill that I had just run down &amp; I couldn't get sufficient pace up on the engine to take me up, so had to take the belt off &amp; push the thing up.  All this time had to stop</p>
