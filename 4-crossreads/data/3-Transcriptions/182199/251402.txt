<p>see them again it is hard to say. &nbsp;I must end&nbsp;now dear Mother. &nbsp;We are all in the best of spirits and looking forward to the time when we shall all be back. &nbsp;In the meantime we are doing our best towards keeping up the good name that I think Australia has fairly won so far in this struggle. &nbsp;With love to yourself and Father</p>
<p>I am</p>
<p>Ever your loving son</p>
