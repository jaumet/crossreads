though tonight I am feeling very much better, but last night I felt absolutely rotten, & so I went to bed early, but could get very little rest, for the boys were celebrating Xmas Eve in our hut, & were keeping their spirits up with cocoa & rum more rum than cocoa I should judge by the row they were kicking up, these were the names of a few of them Freddic Turner, our C.S.M. Jack Hayes (Q.M.) Sgts. Price, Mackie & Bellchambers, Wilson & Cpls. Tin & Bill Bradley, all decent chaps, & songs & chorouses were going round all the evening but about 1O O'clock the performance showed signs of degenerating for the rum was beginning to tell & things were getting boisterous
