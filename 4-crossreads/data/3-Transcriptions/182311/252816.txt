<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At last I have the opportunity to write a few lines and some kind friend to wit Gladys Moor has posted me a note book so now lack nothing and can go right ahead with the story.&nbsp; Details as to dates and place names must of course be omitted, but that will not interfere with the yarn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#39;Tis only three weeks since we left Lark Hill, but really it seems like months, for in that time so much has happened, and as old Bailey says in &quot;Festus&quot; - &quot;We live in Deeds and not in figures on a Dial.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, &quot;Perigrinations of Peters&quot; recommenced when we left Amesbury by rail, journeyed to a port <sub>^</sub><sup>Southampton</sup> and crossed to France; the crossing in a small speedy and crowded steamer was safely accomplished, then a weary march of about six miles uphill to a &quot;Rest Camp;&quot; <sub>^</sub><sup>Le Havre.</sup> tired from the crossing and carrying an exceptionally heavy pack and two blankets - (my kit 65-lbs, the men much more) - the march was hardly joyful and all seemed pleased when the camp was reached and food and rest obtained, chiefly rest.&nbsp; It was here that we made our first attempt at the French language, laughable too, in many cases, but here I found that my picked up French was much more useful that the academic French of companions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here we had our first experience of French Cookery and very delightful too, beans cooked in butter, roasted chickens and French coffee served in cups without handles,</p>
