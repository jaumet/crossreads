<p>The Quest of Love<br/>My sleeping comrades never stirred,<br/>For there had been no call to arms.<br/>Still round the heights the battle rang<br/>Yet not that woke me, but a bird<br/>That somewhere sang.</p>
<p>To hear him sing made me forget<br/>Why I lay here and all such things.<br/>Straightway I felt the wind that blew.<br/>I saw the scattered clouds that let<br/>The stars shine through.</p>
<p>A flame felled all the sky!    &amp;  then,<br/>As swift, died out.  But I had seen<br/>The low black bushes on the hill.<br/>The men that stirred in pain, the men<br/>That lay so still.</p>
<p>At last the gun crashed.  Then for long<br/>The night was vivid with the light,<br/>And shaken with the roar of guns.<br/>And yet I heard a bird's clear song<br/>Ring through it once</p>
<p>I saw he moving on the slope.<br/>At each form fearfully she knelt<br/>And looked intently on the face.<br/>Then on she went again, and hope<br/>Made swift her pace.</p>
