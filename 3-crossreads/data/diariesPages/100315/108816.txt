24/4/18 ? Lavieville
Waxman meantime fired his revolver but it jammed. The Hun's superiority in every weapon costs us a price of human blood life. He then threw two bombs and the Huns ran ? one screaming evidently wounded. Barker was still conscious as Waxman pulled him to cover but soon died and W. dragged his body back to our lines. At dawn I went outside of here and it was lying stiff on a stretcher with staring eyes. I ordered the Roncers to cover it with a blanket. At 4.30 a.m. the Hun opened a gas and shell bombardment and soon had us all sucking our gas tubes.
