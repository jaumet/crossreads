<p>April, 20<br/>74.  1 a.m.<br/>Quiet, but for planes over, all [at ?] supper sudden pause for close listening, then more Moet.</p>
<p>To rejoin our section this morning:  whether this means going back to reserve, or to the new A.D.S., no-one knows.</p>
<p>Caestre, New A.D.S.</p>
<p>75.<br/>Arrived here about 2 p.m., in time for an hour's shelling, the same sensitive shells of Borre &ndash; of terrific explosion, and velocity.  Les, Buck and self to the joint cellar, before leaving, and a bringing back of about 24 bottles of Moet and Leon Chandon, and after tea here, I to the Church in the village, there in the Cure's garden a grouting of a great bundle of spring onions.  Out again, a finding of a great champagne dump &ndash; of Carte d'Or and a dozen other brands, and Prunellas and Liquers.  So an orgie of a minor character.</p>
<p>A. on Night Duty, self with Dresser of Walking Wounded.  Narnsby and self just back from the village proper, after a grouting of three chickens from a ruined wrecked farmhouse, for breakfast tomorrow morning.  While in the hen-house the second barrage of the evening over.  Champagne, Carte D'Or and Prunella a most delightful cocktail.</p>
<p>Mail today, a parcel from Mother &ndash; sox &amp; shaving soap and ordinary, and a note,</p>
<p>"Did I ever tell you Angus and Robertson's rang up and asked your address, as you had ordered some books:  well I told them not to send them, as you had applied to come home, but now I'll go in and tell them to send them on."</p>
<p>So there's the possibility of an early receiving of Adams' Plays and some other decent Australian stuff.  And from the Commonwealth Bank a notification of money being received.</p>
<p>Posted to Beaumonts order of 4/6 for "Oracle of Colour" and J. Freeman's new Morland Press book.  Also a letter written to Commonwealth Bank.</p>
<p>April 21<br/>76.  10.20 p.m.<br/>Last night by the line of the Gods moderately quiet, early a terrible opening up of our guns.  We have heard nothing of its meaning.</p>
