		"p" : "Tale of Tales is a game development studio founded in Belgium in 2002 by Michael Samyn and Auriea Harvey. The name was stolen from a famous collection of Italian fairy tales, Lo cunto de li cunti by Giambattista Basile (1634). During the nineties, Samyn and Harvey – at first independently (as zuper! and entropy8) and then together (as entropy8zuper) – developed an extraordinary body of work, using internet technologies – from simple html to Flash – in order to tell stories and engage the audience. Variously labeled as Net art or Web Cinema, this work finds a natural continuation in Tale of Tales projects, especially the first one: \"8\"."

Inspired by the different versions of the Sleeping Beauty story, it features a deaf mute 8 year old girl as the main character: not a simple avatar, but an half-autonomous character, whose behavior can be modified but not determined by the player. <br />In the following years, Tale of Tales developed many successful projects, including \"The Path\" (2009), a short horror game inspired by the tale of Little Red Riding Hood."

		"p" : "HOW DID \"TALE OF TALES\" COME ABOUT? WHY DID AN ARTIST DUO FEEL THE NEED TO CREATE AN INDEPENDENT TEAM AND WORK TOGETHER ON A VIDEOGAME?<br />We were never simply an artist duo. We were also a design studio. But we made a point of not distinguishing between the two too much. When we designed a website, we wanted it to be meaningful. And when we made art, we wanted it to communicate. There have always been playful elements in our work. And we have always had an interest in creating virtual environments of one kind or other. When web technology started stagnating and the whole thing started to resemble a shopping street, we turned towards a technology that was still growing rapidly and allowed for much more sophisticated applications: real time interactive 3D [1].<br />Also we were a bit fed up with the distinction between doing commissioned jobs to earn money and making art without any financial compensation (we famously failed at making pay-per-view art on line with Skinonskinonskin [2]). On the web people want everything for free. But they don’t mind putting down money for a disc in a box in a store. It’s a contradiction that we accepted since it allowed us to make something of our own invention – and get rewarded for it (which means we could afford to be more serious about our work)."

		"p" : "\"8\" WILL TAKE YEARS TO COMPLETE. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE MAIN STAGES OF THE PROCESS ARE?<br />I think the most important stage of preproduction is behind us now. We have written a scenario, designed the game, made a demo and put together a team for production. That has taken about 2 years. We have also found publishers who are willing to invest in this production (which took another half year). Now all that is left to do is actually make the game. When this is done (in a approximately a year), the publishers will handle the marketing and distribution. And then people can buy the game and hopefully enjoy it."

		"p" : "HOW MUCH IS THE INTERNET COMMUNITY INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS? WHAT ROLE DOES IT PLAY?<br />Is there still an internet community? When we started with this medium, around 1995, we were inspired by an ambitious and intelligent group of people with near to utopian ideals. With the turn of the millennium, the internet has started to resemble the so-called real world more and more: loud, boring and dirty. It’s no longer the safe haven for the gentle and kind that it used to be.<br />That being said, we still use it, perhaps nostalgically. It’s a nice medium to discuss things and research people’s responses to certain ideas. The internet is still part of our work process: our design document is a Wiki for example, and we communicate with all of our team members through various internet technologies."

		"p" : "WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE INDIE GAME DESIGN SCENE? IN YOUR OPINION, WHERE DOES ITS FUTURE LIE? DO YOU THINK IT WILL MANAGE TO CARVE OUT A NICHE FOR ITSELF ALONGSIDE THE BIG GAME CORPORATIONS?<br />I don’t really see how this independent scene has anything to do with game design. They just seem to use games ironically for one or the other purpose. I see no proof of these people being serious about the craft of making games. I think they have already carved out a niche for themselves. Or better: they are filling a niche that has always been there. Academics researching games are very receptive to this type of stuff. I’m sure they prefer looking at intelligent parodies of first person shooters rather than \"Doom\" or \"Half Life\". Whether that entitles them to any authority on the subject of games, game design or game culture is another question.<br />I think these activities are part of the art world and as such part of a self-sustaining and marginal system that has cut all ties with the world inhabited by humans because it is its only means of survival. <br />Within the games industry, there is also an independent games scene. Usually this is about games that can be made cheaply and sometimes they contain innovative designs that are so extreme that only other designers can appreciate them. In general, much like the open source community for other software, the independent games scene is an excuse for the games industry not to have to do anything moral, ethic or even aesthetic."

		"p" : "DO YOU THINK THE VIDEOGAME INDUSTRY AND THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT VIDEOGAMES AS CULTURAL OBJECTS ARE CHANGING?<br />I see a certain polarization happening. The big publishers are getting even bigger. And their products are mostly crap that appeals to the masses. Since they are getting so huge, a lot of smaller publishers simply cease to even try and compete with them. As such, I think, there will be more opportunities in the future for more original and experimental games to be made. As long as we can find ways of making these for relatively modest budgets. I’m not sure what you mean by \"videogames as cultural objects\" and what it means to think about them as such. Can you explain?"

		"p" : "WELL, LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY. I THINK I AM A VICTIM (MORE OR LESS CONSCIOUS) OF THE IDEA THAT VIDEOGAMES ARE A \"LOW\" FORM OF CULTURE, BUT THAT THEY ARE GROWING UP AND BECOMING ONE OF THE \"ARTS\", DEVELOPING MORE FASCINATING AND ARTICULATED NARRATIVES. OR, TO USE A COMPARISON, WE ARE MOVING FROM THE LUMIÉRE BROTHERS’ TRAIN TO JOHN FORD’S INDIANS. I GUESS YOU DON’T AGREE...<br />Well, to make the link to cinema complete, we also have to be aware of the fact that early Hollywood cinema was considered low popular culture at the time. But now all those Bogart movies are considered to be great classics. We think to some extent that society needs to develop an understanding of new media before it can appreciate them. <br />That said, we totally agree with you that most videogames are of poor artistic quality. But we don’t think this will get better in general. I think there will indeed be more highly artistic videogames in the future but there will also be crappier ones. We would argue though that the crap videogames are as much part of the culture as the good ones. It’s a sad fact that in modern society everybody’s opinion is valued equally and since, statistically speaking, most people only have average intelligence or sensitivity, most of modern culture will be of low quality. Especially now that education on aesthetic and intellectual issues is not a high priority, since our democratic rulers have discovered mass media."

		"p" : "\"8\" IS AN AMBITIOUS PROJECT THAT COMBINES A REFINED NARRATIVE WITH GAMING AND INTERACTION. IS IT ART THAT TRIES TO EMERGE THROUGH VIDEOGAMES OR A VIDEOGAME THAT TRIES TO RISE TO THE LEVEL OF ART?<br />That’s a good question. I think it is both but also more than that. I think \"8\", like a lot of our older work, is an attempt for a non-modern kind of art to come to the surface. We think that modern art is at a dead end. Postmodernism pointed this out already but has been unable to provide solutions. I don’t think future art historians will care much about the museums and galleries of the late 20th century. They will look at cinema and advertising and design to find out about our culture. And as you are probably aware of, a lot of rubbish is being created in these media. One of the reasons for this is that too many truly creative people are hiding gutlessly behind their barricades of art magazines and gallery display windows.<br />In other words, we try to bring an artistic experience to a larger audience, yes. I think video games are art. In most cases they are bad art. But most fine art is also bad art. So \"rising to the level of art\" is not something videogames need to do. They are already low enough. Some games are even better than a lot of art. Some art is better than a lot of games. If anything needs to rise to the level of art, it’s art itself."

		"p" : "\"8\" IS A STRANGE GAME: NO LEVELS, NO SCORES, NO COMPETITION, A REFINED DESIGN BASED ON ORIENTALIST PAINTING, A NARRATIVE INSPIRED BY SLEEPING BEAUTY FOLKTALES FROM AROUND THE WORLD, AN AUTONOMOUS CHARACTER WHO EVOLVES THROUGHOUT THE GAME IN RESPONSE TO THE BEHAVIOR OF THE PLAYER: IS THIS YOUR ANTI-IDEOLOGICAL AND AESTHETIC WAY OF REACTING TO THE AGGRESSIVE AND MILITARISTIC IDEOLOGY OF MAINSTREAM VIDEOGAMES?<br />I wouldn’t call \"8\" anti-ideological. The fact that we chose to make a non violent and non competitive game that focuses on pleasure is very much an ideological statement. The fact that it displays a positive image of a culture inspired by Islam is also not without ideological implications these days. I would even say that making a game that attempts to be aesthetically pleasing is even an ideological decision.<br />Mainstream videogames, like all other mainstream cultural expressions are only mirrors of a society. I don’t think George Bush attacked Iraq after playing \"Counter Strike\". If an industry behaves aggressively, it is because there is a large tolerance (if not appreciation) for this type of behavior in society. So if we counter that in our work, we are not just attacking the videogame industry but society at large, I guess.<br />Western countries are becoming more and more conservative and aggressively right-wing. In Belgium this is referred to as people’s mood turning more \"acid\". With our work, we are trying to counter this acidification by allowing people to have pleasure. Pleasure is the sweetness than can dissolve acidity."

It will definitely be available in stores where people can buy boxes with discs in them, since this is something many people still like to do. But if we can help it, we would like to have it distributed electronically as well, for the people who have the luxury of broadband internet."
