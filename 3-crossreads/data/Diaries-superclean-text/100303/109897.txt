There are great flowing rivers of green hill and dale one looks down on the little village nestling in among woods.

In the distance lies Amiens? rising in the centre of which is the old Cathedral with its lofty walls and slender spire and dominating the whole city. The "Push" is said to be going well and successfully pierced their past time and set our cavalry horses. late in the day the ASC had a that a General, his whole staff, 6,000 prisoners had been captured.

Passing through St. SAVEUR we came
