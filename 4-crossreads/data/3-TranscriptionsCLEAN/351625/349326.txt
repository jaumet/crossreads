  
 to give a lot lot of medals to different men & officers who have  one  won them of late.  I have heard no word of Hosier since he left so hope he is doing all right.  My friend Huxley who has been away sick is expected back again in a few weeks. 
 I am afraid I have very little news to tell so will have to let this go rather short.  One good thing we have plenty of amusements here, a fairly good concert every evening given by different Battalion concert parties.  Give my love & kisses to all & whips for yourself. 
 From Your loving Son Douglas
