<p>I had no chance of doing anything with reference to the personal effects still I know his Comrades would look into that &amp; arrange for them to be sent to you.</p>
<p>I often said to Fred we cannot let you go on like this unmarried &amp; his reply was "Oh! Rene is my Sweetheart.  We have grown up together &amp; now she is married I look upon her Home as my Home.  I have heard Brothers say they were fond of their Sisters but <u>never</u> have I heard a Brother speak of his Sisters as Fred would do of you &amp; Trixie.  Not once would he do so but many times a day when we were away on our own together &amp; you were certainly his favorite &amp; he would see something nice &amp; that, he would say, will do for Rene when the war is over.  I said Hubby would be jealous &amp; he said, "No fear for he is another Brother &amp; we are great pals."  If I can obtain any further particulars I will let you have them at once.  We are bound by work to our one little spot so that I can only perhaps get an hour off &amp; then that is not sufficient to go &amp; see his old Battalion.</p>
<p>I pray that this <strike>War</strike> year will end this awful strife &amp; then I trust I will be able to go &amp; see you.  Goodness knows what will be the outlook if it goes on very much longer.  The news at present is good.</p>
<p>I thank you for having my wife &amp; wee ones, Rene up to see you.  Do please for my sake go &amp; see Brenda &amp; try &amp; let her forget for I have been away now since 1914 &amp; the strain for her must be something awful.  I know she is quiet, is it any wonder when I have been away so long from her &amp; I sincerely hope ere long to then thank you in person.</p>
<p>With Kindest regards<br/>Your Cousin<br/>G.C. Somerville</p>
