Another of us finished fighting. Grieg got a piece of shell over the heart and, although almost well yesterday, he died today under an operation. God rest him. In spite of their potatoless days in England we seem to manage to have them nearly every day here. Our mess cook is an expert and out of respect for his culinary skill we are keeping him out of the stunt and not sending him over the bags. The evening was quiet balmy and the men had a concert under Alderson's direction. The doctor and I walked up and down talking about things in general and the War and its ways in particular. A smell of gas was noticeable in the air probably due to a few gas shells being thrown about. The gun flashes were vivid more than usual tonight. The 21st 23rd moved up and took over the firing line ? we follow the day after tomorrow and it seems only too possible that they are going to march us right from here to .
