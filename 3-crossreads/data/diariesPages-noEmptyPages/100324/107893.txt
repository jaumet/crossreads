21/9/15 Gallipoli
ill all the afternoon and had to go to bed. This climate does not suit me ? Egypt did. Dugouts unhealthy cut out of clay they are damp cellarlike. In winter they will be streaming with water the soakage from many graves.

Better but still unwell. Atkinson 23rd killed. Another chap insane. Lone Pine is a hit spot for bombing but our casualties in this Battalion are heavier than any other in the Brigade ? due to their 75's catching us here opposite Johnstons Jolly in enfilade. Sat on a Court Martial at Brown's Dip all the afternoon and when returning with another chap got lost in a maze of trenches and came out exactly where we started. This in broad daylight. Turned in early and had a good sleep.
