dressing him myself.   I think more of this horse than I do of a good many men.
18.11.1916   We have relieved B. Bty 156 Brigade (Tommy Brigade).  Now an S.O.S Bty, now in a very critical position.  Guns three miles away.  This morning is awfully cold.  As far as you can see is as white as a sheet, and a nasty wind is blowing.  This is the place for shells, real coal boxes, they just lob on the hill at our rear, a few hundred yards away.  Capt Olding reported, at D.A. yesterday, rejoining this Bty.
19.11.1916   Wet night, mud worse than ever.  Wagon line shelled at 2 AM. About 50 5.9 inch over   One horse in 1st Bty killed otherwise no damage done.  Bombardment at 2 oclock this evening.  Very little rest in this wagon line.  Big guns about here, very close, shooting all night.
20.11.1916   Wagon line shelled again last night.
