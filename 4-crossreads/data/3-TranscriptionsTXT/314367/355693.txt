After a bit No 1 Pay & self left for a walk - I was guide & took them right round the Gardens & showed them a lot - No 1 (Nelson) is - like me - from Norwich - Very good hearted & queerly intelligent - you'd think he's a fool but he's keenly intelligent in a limited range - He wont try mental excursions - I handed him a Spectator - "A bit too much for me he said" - "You know I don't understand it" "I don't think I'll mind thank you" I'm not given much to heavy reading & so on - Almost every naval man is the same - He was interested - Pay was frankly bored to death - However we blew in at the Officers mess & had aft tea & sat back & talked - Why is Camaraderie so much more marked in the navy than the army? No 1 gave an efficient answer - Because a sailor don't care a dam for anybody or anything & says what he thinks - Boat form Yarra for me - Went to the Destroyer & shifted 4 men into their whaler & off I went to the shore -
