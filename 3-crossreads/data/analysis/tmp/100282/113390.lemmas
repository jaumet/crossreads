 argu the toss as to the way to go . Have been through a lot of them big shop they are splendid , but all the same I do n't think they are much` more up to date than we are in Sydney in this branch . Their tube are splendid wonder to say I find them even easier to find my way about than those of London . Last night Frank I went saw a Grand Opera , " Rigoletto " it was in the Nation Opera to tri describ their theatr would be foolish , magnific is no name for it , built in the olden day of the French Monarchi it is a masterpiec . London theatr are book shop compar to this marvel pile she is someth I shall never forget I wonder if there are ani finer theatr in the world than this masterpiec I doubt it for Pari is the home of this sort of thing , although we could not understand a word of the Opera which is of cours all sing we thorough appreci it for the music etc was love , the act good .
