<p>Dear Sir<br/>I desire to acknowledge the receipt of two parcels containing 62 pairs of socks. Please convey to your splendid army of workers our sincere thanks.<br/>Later on the boys will write and thank the ladies who enclosed messages. Just now we are away on a "flying column" but our isolation from our base makes your splendid gift more than ever acceptable</p>
<p>Best wishes for the coming year to all at the 1st L.H. Comforts dept.<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>W.J. Ahearn, Lt<br/>O.C. No 1 Section<br/>M.G. Sqd. 1 A.L.H.</p>
