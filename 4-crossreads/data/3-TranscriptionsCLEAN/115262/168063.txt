  
 Tuesday 23 October 1917. 
 Still on the move and travelled till 4 a.m. most of the time through enemy country when hardly a sound was heard. (None allowed) Lay down when we halted at 4 a.m and slept till dawn & were awakened by an explosion of a mine of the engineers sinking a well. 
 Camped in the waddy and prepared a rough meal which we cooked ourselves. Our position is  near  on the left Sth East flank of Birsheebah & 5 miles from the front Turkish trenches. Bedouins captured.  
 Near the ruins of an old city built ages ago by King Constantine 1600 yrs  ago  B.C.
