<p>[10th Jan. contd]<br/>It may be interesting to describe an Estaminet scene (I have often been delighted to visit to see the fun)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not like our Hotels and the villages simply abound with them.  There is a counter in some case where the beer etc is handed over.  You walk in get your drink &amp; sit down at a table of which there are usual a dozen in each outfit.  Then the piano starts &amp; fun commences &amp; more you drink the better you sing.  Style Compre.  At 8 o'clock (weet heure) kick out time comes.</p>
