 Saturday 17 March 1917 [16 March 1918] &frac12; day and went town, shopped, cakes, etc. for tomorrow's picnic then back to 27th &amp; whist drive following concert 6-8 p.m.  Very enjoyable and nice men to play with. With these pts. I am quite at my ease &amp; to know one is liked is a great help &amp; relief from the strain of S. Piele who I fancy is almost beside herself with nerves. Raining today &amp; of late have had a few showers &amp; big soft clouds like our own land in rainy times. The willows are coming into leaf &amp; all fruit trees in blossom. Spring is coming once again &amp; in France they prepare for the big offensive &ndash; maybe the last.
