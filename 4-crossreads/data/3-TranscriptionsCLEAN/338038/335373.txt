but have changed my plans & am going down to Brighton for a couple of days first. I had a rather nasty dose of gas just before  leaving the Battery & think a couple of days swimming will set me up.
I telegraphed Sis as soon as I arrived but she has not replied yet.
No letters from you for what seems years but the last couple of mails have been sent down. There was a mail in just as I left so I suppose
