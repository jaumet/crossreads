<p>France<br/>1.2.17</p>
<p>My dear Mrs. Ferguson,</p>
<p>An excellent little parcel.  The only unfortunate part is that I am at present suffering from a very heavy cold and cannot duly appreciate the cigars, I can however all the more fully appreciate the socks.  You know my luck seems always to be wonderfully good.  After being away for just two months, I came back and for 8 days &amp; commanded the Bn.  Then just as the Bn was about to move up into the line, the Colonel came back &amp; resumed command.  I then became second in command and, as such, was left out of the line in command of certain details &amp; things.  So that instead of being in front line, I am now in a comfortable hut with a good brazier burning, and plenty of blankets.</p>
<p>Am still getting fine letters from home.  Mother seems to be pushing along very well and working hard.</p>
<p>This is the first decent chance I have had to clean up my letter department since I rejoined.  You see one is very busy when one commands one's unit.</p>
<p>Best of Love<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>Caesar</p>
