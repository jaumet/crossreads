James and Brazenor and we had coffee together in the mess. In the afternoon paraded the men who won decorations and addressed them. Also took the new young officers and gave them advice about their duties. In the afternoon later attended an excellent football match in which "A" Coy played the rest of the Battalion. After mess Colonel Moseley came along for particulars of Rome &amp;c. A cold blustery night. Sent Cawthorn in for my move order.
