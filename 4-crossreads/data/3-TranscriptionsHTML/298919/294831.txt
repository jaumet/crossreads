<p>At 8am Scarborough one of the East Coast Towns which was bombarded by the German fleet some time ago, was abeam, though, owing to the mist and our distance off the land we could not see it.  At 9am Whitby another of the towns raided, was abreast.  The ruined Abbey which was mentioned in the papers was clearly visible on an eminence.  The town which is a large sized one, nestled in the hills.  At 11am we were in Tee Bay opposite Hartlepool, waiting for the tide to rise to go up the river.  At 1.30 this having risen sufficiently we passed through the breakwater into the river Tee.  Anchored at the entrance was a British submarine C11, and a little further up a light cruiser &amp; submarine B15[?]</p>
