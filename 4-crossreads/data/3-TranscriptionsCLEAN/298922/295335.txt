 On Frontier. 
 Divisional Hd. Qts. were quite surprised that no Funk Holes were made in their Brigade to get into when being Bombed. As John Thorpe has written our men turn round, & "call the Bomb a Bastard" and then go on with their work. 
 Left Sheik Zowabin at midnight & attacked Rafa 1st L.H. in advance, after riding all night we were not too fresh but our boys kept up their tradition & after a long day's fighting we captured the position by 5 o'clock together with 4 guns 2 machine guns & all personnel & Slova. 
 The N.Z.M.R. we must admit did the 'best' job, getting the main redoubt. 
 [This sentence crossed through]  Our Casualties 2 Officers wounded 4 men killed 28 wounded.
