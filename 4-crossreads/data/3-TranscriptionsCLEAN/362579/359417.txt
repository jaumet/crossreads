I shall have to spend the money I've got in Pay-book on my leave   &  clothing, Boots, coats, umbrella etc.   &  everything is very expensive.
I have sent a number  of cards to my Aust. friends, hope I have not missed any. Could not do the, all the same week but made a list   &  crossed off each one, as I wrote it. To my delight got Alice's letter of July 22nd   &  Jane's of 21st July so you see I've had a great mail this time.
