12/11/18 Yzeux
Lovely day but cold wind. Rode to St Vast first seeing Greene's demonstration platoon. Saw boxers training. Last night the ball the boys gave the m'selles was a great success. I saw "K" Co do a tactical scheme and then lunched with the officers. Rode over to the 5th Bde sports at Vignacourt and saw a good many French people there. Our fellows are great friends with the local inhabitants and quite members of their families. Generals Robertson, Martin and Wisdom were there. One event was a race for French boys and girls and aroused great enthusiasm. Returned to St Vast for afternoon tea and then pushed off for Yzeux. A moonlight ride and the air cold. Terms of armistice announced in Daily Mail today. The French people all jubilant.
