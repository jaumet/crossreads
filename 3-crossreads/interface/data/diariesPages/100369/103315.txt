to our great disappointment we were told to get off. We thought we were going right in to business. We are now in Palestine and the Turks are entrenched at Gaza about nine or ten miles away. The sound of the big guns is very plain from here. Just about half a mile away is the ruin of a very old Church said by some to have been built by the Crusaders about 500 years ago. By others it is said to have been built earlier, before Christ. 
Just in front (about 10 or 12 miles is Gaza, the Gates of which Samson dealt with so summarily in days gone by, when the Philistines had encompassed the City.
Then there is Samson's Ridge, of which the Turks hold one half, and we the other. This is where tradition says Samson slew the Phillistine with a Jawbone. Wanted: a few more Jaw bones to smite Abdul. After being in Khan Yunis for about five weeks we have packed up the whole camp and are now at Rafa. By train we went to New Rafa, and after being there a couple of days packed all our gear onto Camels, and moved Camp to Old Rafa
