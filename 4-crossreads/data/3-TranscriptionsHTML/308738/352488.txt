<p>July 31 Saturday 1915<br/>Working till 3 PM sorting all day feeling little better</p>
<p>Trams: The Trams in Alexandra are inferior in comfort &amp; running to our Brisbane Service. Some are Double Deckers, but the discomfort of getting up &amp; the low roof, then the extra vibration is much against this build. The Tram lines are laid with as many curves &amp; corners that the passenger is heaved from one side to the other &amp; is in constant dread of being at times thrown out. In starting the whole thing goes off with a jerk, &amp; it is quite a balancing feat to keep oneself from being sent into the corner.</p>
<p>August 1 Sunday 1915<br/>Went to hear Pres Minister in morning &amp; after dinner walked round to Russell Soldiers Home had a light tea there then went to hear Methodist chaplain at night.</p>
<p>August 2 Monday 1915<br/>Packing up all day &amp; taking mail &amp; kit to station went &amp; said goodbye to Victor Convas &amp; the friends in the Russell Soldiers Home. Feeling better.</p>
