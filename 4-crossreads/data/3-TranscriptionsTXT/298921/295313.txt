 December Monday 1915 1.30 AM In two hours I should be off the Peninsula, with the rear guard the Garrison have all gone wearing  soks  on their boots for silence &ndash; Time drags 1000's Turks are in front watching us, but they are puzzled at our silence &ndash; a few shells on the beach &amp; Machine guns that is all &ndash; so far &ndash; I scribble this in the signal dugout &ndash; on board SS Prince [indecipherable] 4 A We were the last to leave &amp; had a good run, I have only what I stand up in &ndash; 1 p.m. Transhipped to a larger boat the SS Elelle where we will be drafted &amp; landed at different camps at mudros &ndash; for a few days. Now I am going for a hot bath  then a sleep.
