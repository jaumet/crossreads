<p>as everyone seems to have worry in another way. I am preparing again for my quarterly stock which comes round for me far too soon. I am sorry you have been troubled with rain, this week we have had our share but I hope it has now ceased for a time to give the farmers a chance, they are all so busy being so short handed. I have to remember all our people to you Jim with best wishes from myself hoping to find you well.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>
