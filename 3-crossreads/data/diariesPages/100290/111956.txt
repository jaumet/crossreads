Friday
Up at 6.30 a.m. Ready to start off again at minute's notice. Day goes by without further orders. A great pleasurable surprise this evening. Bob comes in just as we were having tea. His unit has been following us up all this time and is at present just camped outside the village. We have great yarn. He saw tony the day before. His lot also on trek. Saw our W. O. re transfer. His colonel won't grant it without exchange.
We visit the aerodrome see about 20 planes. Examine them all over. Watch one mount go over enemy lines on a scouting expedition. Each to our own billets Receive letters. from Mary Janet Mac. Tim, Jean Aberdeen.
