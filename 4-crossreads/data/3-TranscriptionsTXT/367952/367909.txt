 Transcribers note: Kings Crest on top of Page. 
 He whom this scroll commemorates was numbered among those who, at the call of King and country, left all that was dear to them, endured hardness, faced danger, and finally passed out of the sight of men by the path of duty and self-sacrifice, giving up their own lives that others might live in freedom. Let those who come after see to it that his name be note forgotten. 
 Pte. Thomas Bell 20Bn.  A.I.F.
