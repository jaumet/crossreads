<p>Extract Dairy on route</p>
<p>Cairo, Egypt mostly.<br/>Since last month have completely changed our surroundings.  From a sea of water we have been transferred to a sea of sand.  We are now camping on the desert under the shade of the great pyramid "Knut or Gizeh" near the village of Mena.</p>
<p>We arrived at Alexandria on Dec. 3rd &amp; were put on a train at 9 a.m. &ndash; reached Cairo 2 p.m., had a piece of bread &amp; cheese &amp; half a cup of cocoa supplied to each man:  loaded our baggage on to trolley cars &amp; left at 5 p.m. for Mena which is 10 miles away.  By the time we had our baggage into camp it was 8 p.m.<br/>We rolled up in our blankets &amp; slept in the open on the sand.  A heavy dew fell, which made our blankets quite wet.  They never get rain here;  the dews which fall wet the ground as though a heavy fall of rain had taken place.  At Alexandria we were not allowed leave (We had it though) but on some of the other boats leave was given to a number of men.  There was quite a number of German boats in habour;  they had been captured since the war commenced.</p>
<p>The approach to Alexandria by sea is very pretty.  The land is low &amp; sandy.  The city stretches for about 9 miles along the sea front.  There is a fine light house</p>
