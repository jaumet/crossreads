is a translation of message thrown into us by the Turks probably a counterblast to ours of a similar nature asking them to surrender ?
"To our Brave Enemy
I have spoken with people from different parts of AsiaMinor. I asked them what the English people were doing. In the parts where the English walk they quickly make plenty of friends whatever they want is procured for them. In places they walk amidst gardens and streams. They are living in good health with the friends they have found. The Turks are doing all the work for the prisoners. Come! surrender! the hospitality of the Turks will make you well"
We get plenty of information from deserters and from prisoners and know a good deal about strengths dispositions etc`				. At 2040 starting with a steady "dribble" from machine guns the enemy gradually worked up to a great fusillade of heavy musketry probably to cover a counterattack on some trenches our right advanced last night. Bombs whizzing very close only a foot or so overhead and bursting down the valley passing like streaks of fire. We did not reply unless targets offered.
2100 slackening off but our machine guns are letting out an occasional burst so some target must be presented. Quite a lively interlude ? some excitement to appreciate after the dullness of late. Like old times Mitchell putting roof of iron of my dugout after dark stirred up a nice little hornet's nest the snipers poured it in so close he had to leave the job until black darkness set in. Bed at 2200 fully equipped and ready
