<p>on a dark night it would not be difficult to stay about 300' one side or another, but neither of us did. Half the twenty &amp; both officers got through by mixing with another company which lost its direction &amp; got across our front. This being finished we again formed up in line of platoons, not a man was lost, &amp; after prearranging several whistle signals we marched back to camp. When we neared the lines, the company formed columns of rank on the signal. The first words spoken were "fall out the officers".</p>
<p>That is only one instance, but if the 5th &amp; 6th reinforcements were taken out, B Coy could take on any company on earth at anything. Excuse me being so long winded, but when I start on B Company I don't know when to stop.</p>
<p>Your affectionate brother</p>
