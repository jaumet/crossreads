<p>Dear Mr. Layton,<br/>I am sending Mrs. Mackay to you to ask if you can give her a little money to keep her going until her husband's first pay comes to her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mackay has been to you &amp; you are going to pay her debts she tells me, but you have not mentioned that you will pay her debt on Furniture &amp; she was afraid to mention it this morning.</p>
<p>Trusting you will be able to help her</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>E. H. Bennie.</p>
