<p>1/6/19<br />Edinburgh<br />Went with Audrey to 0St Johns Church in Princes St &ndash; the fashionable church full of well fed unctuous and eminently respectable folk. After we had lunched we had a turn in the gardens and there met an officer of the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders and his wife. Their little youngster afforded us much amusement all the rest of the <strike>morning</strike> afternoon. We dined quietly in the evening and then we talked all till bed time. This morning the view of the Castle from Princes Street was superb &ndash; the embodiment of Scotch character standing up on its stern crags. There used to be a loch at its feet but now there exists a fine garden which today was ablaze with tulips and rhodedendrons. To bed after 11.</p>
