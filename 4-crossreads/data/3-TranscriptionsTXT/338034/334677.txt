 Oct 14th :- All men of the Brigade are to receive eight days leave to Alexandria. They have been going in batches &amp; more than half the Regt. have already gone. I hope to be going tomorrow. Have been getting some very good swimming in the Suez Canal. Oct 15th left Kantara in the morning for Sidi Bishr Rest Camp where we arrived about 5 p.m. The camp is very comfortable &amp; is situated close to the sea. Alexandria is about 5 miles distant connected by electric tram service.
