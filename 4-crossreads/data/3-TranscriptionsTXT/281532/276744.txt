17/10/18 Yzeux
jute factories here but they are hidden from view down in a hollow. Passed only through the outskirts of the town and came on to the main road again. Gangs of Chinese working along here. Leaves falling from the trees. In one place there is as fine a half mile of autumn leaves as could be seen in a day's march. Returned to Chateau - this is indeed an existence of luxury! Dressed for dinner and then took a turn round the grounds. In Yzeux someone old died today and much tolling of bells took place. The Cure is aged and sporty with a nose convivial in looks. He lives beside the old church. At the rear is an old churchyard. These old villages are very picturesque but terribly damp and unhealthy - no wonder so many people are doubled with rheumatics.
