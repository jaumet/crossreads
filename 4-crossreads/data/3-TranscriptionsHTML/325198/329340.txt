<p>Ballad of Waney's Desperate Doings</p>
<p>Now Waney's an Australian, an Australian to the core<br/>The fighting blood  is in him &amp; he comes to every war<br/>Now 'twas some where in Egypt that this desperado strayed<br/>In fact I rather fancy he was 'on leave' in Port Said.</p>
<p>In a quiet secluded village, I think they call it Arab town<br/>Where French damsels of ill virtue, &amp; picquets hunt you down<br/>Old Waney wandered slyly carrying quite a dozen beers<br/>Till the cry of "Help us Aussie" made him prick up both his ears<br/>And girding up his loin cloth like Horatios of old<br/>With blue mettle in his pockets advanced with mien so bold</p>
<p>Now this awe inspiring spectre would the boldest man appal<br/>For there stood three Light Horse men with their backs against a wall<br/>And facing them two Gippos with their wives &amp; several sons<br/>Were forcibly demanding payment for some current buns</p>
