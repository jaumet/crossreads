  
 so that night 7th January I went down on the train to Cairo & here we were met by a motor ambulance which took us to No.2. Ghezerieh one of the finest of Egyptian hospitals, before the  war it was a palace belonging to one of the Egyptian princes, & he handed it over to the authorities on the outbreak of war, it is a most beautiful building inside for the rooms are a tremendous size & well finished, they have enomorous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings & electric lit throughout, Ghezerieh is right alongside the Nile & the trains run right past the door almost, & the drives are good
