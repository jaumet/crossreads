commandeered, the drivers being compelled to take the troops to camp free of charge. There was very little sleep for anyone in camp that night for tent raids   & bon-fires were numerous for the boys were all excited  & anxious to get away after four long months in camp. breakfast was early next morning after which the troops were formed up  & marched to Liverpool station entraining about 4.15AM on the 23rd December 1915 there being 1200 troops occupying three special trains. All the way down the line to Sydney the troops were cheered among flag waving  & whistles, the excitement growing every minute until reaching Sydney when it was at fever heat. On disentraining at Sydney we set out on the march up Wentworth Avenue to Woollomooloo wharf where the Transport lay. There was a great throng of people enroute  & I met all who came to see me off, at the wharf gates  & after saying good-bye to all marched onto the boat "S S" "Suevic" Transport A29. When all the troops were aboard, the gangways were pulled up, then the people were allowed on the wharf, the bands striking up popular airs kept things alive. Streamers were thrown up by the people on the wharf below  & as the ship pulled away from the wharf the streamers broke, the massed bands playing "For Auld Lang Syne". After this the ship made its way out into the stream where we remained for the day having launches  & small boats out to visit us. The anchor was weighed about 4.30 PM  & with steam up the ship made its way slowly towards the Heads which were cleared about 5 PM. Once outside the ship turned south following the coast and many an old familiar spot was recognised until night began to fall when the coast line faded out of sight. It was then most of the boys, self included, began to feel the strain of the days experience which could be marked as one of the most eventful days of your life  & all soon sought comfort in a sleep below. our bunks consisted of two blankets  & a canvas hammock which was swung on hooks in the roof between decks. These proved very comfortable to sleep in no matter how the ship moved the hammock always remained in the same position; but they were very awkward to get in  & out of  & many of the boys fell to the floor while trying to do so. However these difficulties were soon overcome  & was not long before I fell to sleep and experiencing the open sea for the first time in my life.
At SeaThe following morning the 24th December 1915 broke with the ship well out to sea  & as the day wore on there was great excitement aboard as it was found that a girl, whose name was Maud Butler, was aboard dressed in khaki. On being found she was immediately quartered in the Captains Cabon on the bridge  & of course all the boys were curious to get a glimpse of her, most of the boys being successful. The troops were never told how the girl was actually found but she was thought a dinkum heroine, a very substantial collection being raised in admiration of her pluck. The same afternoon we slowed down, a ship coming up astern which we were told was the Achilles a Blue funnel cargo boat which has since been sank by the Huns. When this boat pulled up close by, our ship stopped  & a small boat was lowered from our ship  & the girl accompanied by ships officers left for the Achilles. As the small boat left ringing cheers followed it, the troops waving, the girl answering, until the Achilles was reached, when the girl was seen to mount the ladder onto the boat. On the return of the ships officers we set full steam ahead  & was not long before the Achilles  & our heroine we well out of sight. Next morning the troops had to settle down to ship routine orders
