here, they belong to the Mining Batt. & are tunneling under the German lines, they reckon the whole line is mined Ypres to Armienties & is almost ready to blow up, there will be something doing then I'll bet.
Great big dugouts are being built along the line they are about 20 feet deep & are big enough some of them to hold a hundred men nicely.
The trenches here are in a most disgraceful state, the Canadians don't seem to have made any attempt to keep them up to the scratch, you can wade through mud & slush a foot deep & if you dig down you will come to duckboards & galvanized iron that they have let be swamped & in some places you can dig them
