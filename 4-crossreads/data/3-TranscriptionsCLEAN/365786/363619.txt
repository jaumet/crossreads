Stretcher cases could lie down & walking cases sit up.These trains were very long & as you could walk from one end to the other the wounded were classified while on the train.At C, number of R + assistants used to meet the trains & supply light refreshments, cigarettes etc. while the men were waiting till their turn came for the ambulance.  Hardly any have any thing - some in bandages & blankets, others dirty, bloodstained clothes minus buttons & sleeves - one man was proud because he had saved his cap & one puttee.  Of course no matter what they bring back on them goes straight to the sterilizer then is laundered
