3/4/18 ? Berthen
It is a fine chapel, modern and the whole place is said to be largely supported by English money. The original place was erected in 1088 and renovated 1630 and after. Had a drink with the Dr. in their mess and then rode back to Berthen. The re-action after a month's hard trench work is on the men and a little beer knocks them over. About m.n. received word that L/ Cpl. Lee had died in the 22nd Corps Guard Room. This man was well known in Australia as comedian for Branscombe's "Dandies". Lately he has been getting drunk a lot generally going to the pack. Possibly killed in a brawl but the doctor can see no injury.
