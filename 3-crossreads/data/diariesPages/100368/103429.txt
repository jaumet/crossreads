D and myself were picked to go on a Hospital Ship. There were twenty men picked and the remaining twenty five were asked to volunteer. The result was a great deal more volunteered than were required. We were put through a medical test and told to keep ourselves in readiness.
We thought our "luck was in" this time.

More patients from the Dards.

Went to the Aquarium which is only a short walk from here. The grounds are very nicely laid out. In the centre is a large Ghrotto. It is nice and cool inside and in niches
