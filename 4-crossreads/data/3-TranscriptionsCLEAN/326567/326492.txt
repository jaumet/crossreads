lamp to use at Night. We walked about during the Evening & had a few drinks & was introduced to several of his chums, It was amusing watching the Militiary Police who were only over from England a few day previously. They were ordering the Boys to take their hands out of their pockets & button the lids over their coat pockets, the Boys about took it as a joke & started barracking the Police. They anyhow got a hot reception from the troops everywhere. This fun was kept up until 9 Pm when all Troops had to be in their Billets, so we made our way to our quarters after an enjoyable evening, My Brother brought 5 blankets from their Quarter Master for me to sleep in & as they had a spare bunk I soon made myself comfortable & after talking until nearly 11 Pm I soon was fast asleep.Sunday July 1st 1917.I awoke at 7 am after a good nights rest although the Guns were booming over in that sector but not so bad as over our way I was not disturbed. After having breakfast I amused myself walking about the workshops & watching people going to Church until 11 am when I said Good Bye
