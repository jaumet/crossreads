<p>According to their religion (Mohammedan) they must wash in running water. To do this they don a robe or loin cloth &amp; standing on the after deck pour jam tins of water over their head. They have other religious principles such as putting mustard seed oil on their hair etc. All these quaint ideas must be allowed &amp; their representatives in Calcutta, Bombay &amp; other ports, see that they do get them too. They are slow workers but will do a wonderful amount in their own way. They work at one speed always &amp; nothing can make them hurry, nor can they be persuaded to forsake any particular routine they follow. It is better to leave them alone. They are not backward at stealing if they are not likely to be caught but the Sucanies (quartermasters) &amp; the Serang (Chief) can be trusted without fear, they being a higher caste than the others. They do not value life at all once their blood is up &amp; threaten murder wholesale. They are remarkable in their ways of purchasing goods. They go ashore with &pound;1 &amp; come back with boots, coats, hats etc etc &amp; about 17/6 left. When they draw any money Serang stands by &amp; demands so much "backsheesh" which they dare not refuse for Serang would belt them with a cane later on.</p>
