EXTRACTS from 
Soliloquies of a Subaltern
Somewhere in France

"The Contemptible Army"
(Humbly dedicated to H.I.M. the German Emperor.)
No over-medalled Army ours,
To plunder, rape or loot;
Or call upon Celestial Powers
As partners, while we shoot
No little children dread our name;
For us no women pale;
And undefended towns aflame
Mark only "Culture's" trail.
Perhaps our knighthood hasn't shone,
Whilst churches burn and fall;
We're just content to carry on
As ordered - that is all.
