<p>glorious evening the clouds rolled away &amp; the sun came out nice &amp; bright making the whole land look just like one huge flower &amp; vegetable garden &amp; the trees looked as green as could be for all their leaves were washed clean of the dust, &amp; everything smelt so lovely.</p>
<p>I dropped into the Daimler tea rooms &amp; here I met Doherty &amp; McGuire so we then had a run round town I was on the look out for films but never a one could I get they are as precious as gold &amp; just as scarce.</p>
<p>8th. Into the city again this morning searching for films but not a one could I get for love nor money &amp; they reckon they wont have any in till Wednesday.</p>
