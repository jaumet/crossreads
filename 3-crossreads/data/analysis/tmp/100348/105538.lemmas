 1st March 1916 . Work with the bomb class today . We are nicknam the " Suicid Club " ; and it strike me that a man will need plenti of sand to see this busi through . Scotti came over from the Oasi where he is situat with the 1st A.L.H. We went to a concert , by the local talent . 4/3/16 Got a first class pass from the Bomb school , and a day off to go to Cario . Got an identif slip from Base Headquart and went and drew 7 from the bank . Visit the museum , and view mani interest relic . I saw a set of "diaval " that had been taken from some ancient tomb . I alway thought it was a new game . Spent the rest of the even in town , and did myself grand .
