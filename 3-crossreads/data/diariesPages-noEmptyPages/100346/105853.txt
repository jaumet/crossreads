Voices From Home.
Though I hear but tongues of a foreign people
 I list to sounds that are strange new
Clear as a silver bell in a steeple
Come voices from home so fond true
I sit at times when the leaves are falling
Alone with my thoughts as I sit today
 listen to voices from homeland calling
Calling so sweetly Ah! Could I but obey
 so there is no sting to death
 grave has lost its victory
Tis but a crossing ? with bated breath
 white set face ? a little strip of sea
To find our loved ones waiting on the shore
More beautiful more precious than before
