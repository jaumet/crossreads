  
 Saturday 26.10.'18 Just 1 year since our arrival here (by calendar date), a w'k over really.  C. Loddiges gives good cough mist 10 a.m. Friday & examines wrist, orders bandage.  Saturday 9 a.m. has both wrists x-rayed by Capt. Reid - result, slight thickening - strapped if no better.  Very smart M.O. in ward, said to be the best in 31st. Off 2-5, print photos.  Convoys fewer today but every bed full in D. i. 
 Sunday, 27/10/'18 Off 5 p.m.  Major Birch came, took me Shepheard's tea - very pretty scene & enjoyable talk & motor ride back to 31st.  Convoys are beginning again.  Sent all Xmas greetings across the water.  Did duty in home 'till 10 p.m. 
 Monday Very busy day, had ward thoroughly cleaned.  No M.O., C. Loddiges ill.  Major Gaffney did a "round" 7 p.m.  F.E.H. not at all impressed.  Off duty 2-5.  Photo printing, writing, etc.  Lovely day only still rather hot.
