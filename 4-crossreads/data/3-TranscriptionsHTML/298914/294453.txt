<p>drawn in.  5 pm Armoured cars drawn in. Amuse ourselves by [indecipherable] VKS wireless in Gaza.  Big KrUPP gun near Beersheba sending over HE'S and trying to find our 8 in howitzers.  Taube spotting by wireless for him.  HEs shows make a great noise.  Taube fired at by MG and rifle fire.  6 PM. All artillery in and a hell fire too.  Turkish redoubts blown to hell.  8000 reinforcements set out from  SIMSUR towards us.</p>
<p>[Insert taken from page 18]<br/>*Sunday night the infantry singing hymns.*</p>
<p>A battery 6th LH &amp; NZs meet them.  In the twilight on can see the flash from guns &amp; hear the rumble of the HE'S on the redoubts.  All redoubts give in except the main one.  NZ'S and 2nd have street fighting in Gaza.  6.30 PM dismantle and 7 PM leave &amp; try to pick up cable to follow back to Beila.  A dreary trip.  Pass the reinforcements mentioned and the armoured cars.  Practically lost so turn in alongside a Tommy outpost absolutely done up.  Hit the pillow &amp; finish.<br/><u>27th/3/17</u><br/>Awakened at 6 am by General Royston who with 3rd Bde were leaving &ndash; having been forced to retire. Furious firing near</p>
