  
 Friday 5 September 1919 Had a bad night. Very few people had a good one here. Boat rolled & tossed about all night. Very big seas. Two big wash places for the men were absolutely wrecked & washed overboard. One officers cabin got washed out & two or three decks (mens) had 2 & 3 feet of water in them. The men had a bad time. Still a bog sea on today. Very cold all day. Had plenty of rain & hail. Won 10/- in a sweep. Slept nearly all the afternoon. 
 Saturday 6 September 1919 Saw the sun for a while today. Not so cold & windy. Had a bad cut today & got my tooth fixed up once more. Read all day again. My eyes are aching a bit.
