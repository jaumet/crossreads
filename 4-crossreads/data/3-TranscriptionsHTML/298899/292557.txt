<p>Peristyle in the front is supported by 22 fluted columns with the inscription &ndash; 'aux grands hommes la Patrie reconnaissante.' (The states tribute to its great men) In the crypt are buried such well known men as Victo Hugo, J.J.Rousseau, Voltaire, Soufflot, Emile Zola &amp; many others. Lunch time being nigh we visited a restaurant in the Boulevard St Germain. After lunch we walked by way of the boulevard to the Hotel des Invalides in order to see Napoleon's tomb which we missed on our previous visit, but found it closed, so then taking a cab we drove to the Caserne in Place St Augustin to report, having orders to catch the 11.40 train that night. Before proceeding to do some shopping we had another look at the Saint-Augustin Church, a splendid building indeed &amp; altho' quite modern, has quite fine stained glass windows. For our shopping we then walked along the Boulevarde to the Rue Royale calling in for a few minutes at the Madelaine which we had seen the first day imperfectly owing to a service being on. Our many visits to these churches convinced us of the control the church has over the people &amp; the great comfort the people get from the church all day &amp; every day the people enter for worship or prayers</p>
