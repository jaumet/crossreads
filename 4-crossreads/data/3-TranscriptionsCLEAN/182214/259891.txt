bombardment going on. Oct 31st.It rained during the afternoon but I saw several battles in the air saw two [?] down but didn't know whose they were so put them down to Fritzy, Jim Kelly got badly hit in the head, Nov2nd  a fine day for a change counted 73 aeroplanes in the air & saw some good fights. one brought down in flames a few more had another fight. The Horse Ambulances were not much use so they invented sledges to put the wounded on & drawn along by a horse a very good idea & the [?] got a better ride. Fritzy sends us a few [?] at night along the top road.
