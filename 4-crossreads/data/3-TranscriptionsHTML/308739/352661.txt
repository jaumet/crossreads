<p>Sunday 20 February 1916<br/>Went into Cairo to Church, afternoon spent at Soldiers Home.  Went to Zoo &amp;amp; Acquarium, returned Camp 6 p.m.<br/>Sunday in Cairo is quiet as most of the Leading places close down.  The Native Quarters are not effected at all by the Sabbath Day &amp;amp; one can see the people still clinging to their old beliefs.  Sunday is Harvest Day for these people of Business, as Rich &amp;amp; poor alike Frequent these Lower Quarters when the Modern City Sleeps.</p>
<p>Monday 21 February 1916<br/>Orders out to leave early this week for somewhere on the Canal.  All Troops with Horses &amp;amp; Waggons going by Train.  The news is hard to believe but with Hope stirring us, we again prepare by sorting out &amp;amp; packing away the things most useful for the Desert Life.</p>
<p>Tuesday 22 February 1916<br/>Went into Cairo to arrange for Stuff in connection with Trip to Canal zone.  As we do not know our allotted Camp, we buy up a Quantity of Tin Fruit, Meats &amp;amp; other dainties.  Once on the move each Officer has to look after No. 1, but I generally prepare for 2 or 3 extra.  We have had a Quiet time here at Maadi with every comfort, but expect this move will bring us into Line with those who rough it.</p>
<p>Wednesday 23 February 1916<br/>Working Hard all Day packing up.  3rd Regiment left to-night for Serapeum on Canal.<br/>The Brigade Capt. has left for the Canal zone to pick out the different positions for our new Camp.  The 1st Train loaded with Troops &amp;amp; Horses leave at midnight so the 5th Regiment are dismantling &amp;amp; entraining to-day.</p>
