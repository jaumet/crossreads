 The wind & rain continues, the sea is getting very rough & it is nearly impossible to stand on deck. Most of the chaps are seasick, I am not feeling too happy myself but I am not at all ill. 
 It is becoming a juggling trick to eat your meals nowadays, you dare not take your hand off your plate for a moment & have to eat with the other. 
 It has been raining on & off all the morning but after dinner the wind went down & the sun showed up a bit though the sea is still rough.
