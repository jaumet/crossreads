Versailles is a wonderful place. We walked round a portion of the place & admired the buildings & its environments. On entering the court yard we could not help admiring the fine statues that surround the grounds. In the middle of the court yard stands the statue of King Louis XIV, from here we obtained a fine view of the whole Palace. At time was short we did not venture indoors, but strolled round the marvellous place admiring the fine sculpturing that adorn the walls.  On approaching the front of the building we were amazed at the beautiful scenery. A beautiful garden with fountains & fine statues dotted here & there,  I am sure it must have been a mile in length, here once again, words fail me to describe the scene. Strolling round another portion we looked through the fine arched windows of the Palace, & almost every room we saw contained beautiful painting, & the furniture was grand.Louis XIV was evidently in love with himself, as we saw a great number of paintings of this famous King. Just before entering the court yard again, we came across a portion of the building which was badly battered about.  It was here that the infuriated mob attacked the Palace in 1774, at the time of the French Revolution, it was from here that Marie-Antoinette was taken to the Bastille to her death. One could spend a whole day here exploring this old historic place, but four days holiday soon pass, & we reluctantly left the place for the tram, arriving at our Cafe about 1.30 p.m. All the writing & books in the world cannot describe the beauty & splendour of Versailles Palace even a hurried visit like we had is not enough to obtain an idea of it. We only say a very minute-portion of the building. Why the grounds alone are much bigger than the Botanical Gardens, Sydney, even bigger than Hyde Park London.
The dinner at the Cafe was must enjoyable, included in our Menu, were Snails, Mussels, & Brussels Sprouts, dainty dishes, I can assure you.   In the afternoon, Eric & I set forth to find Ruelle, we travelled from one side
