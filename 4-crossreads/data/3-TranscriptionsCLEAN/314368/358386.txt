you half a dozen or so photos of myself, taken by an amateur just outside the hospital. I don't think they are very good but they could have been worse. I was taken in my hospital uniform just coat and pants the dress is blue (fairly warm, and comfortable to knock about in) and white shirt and red tie.
Well mother, as soon as I have had my leave I will be able to give you a detailed account of my London experiences, so I shall have to sign off now.Trusting that this will find you and dad, and all the family OK, with best and fondest love to you all
Your loving SonGordon
