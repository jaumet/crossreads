<p>3/11/16  Friday</p>
<p>Drizzling rain &amp; very cold. Heavy bombarding night &amp; day &ndash; Fritz shelling all party's on the skyline. Capt Helstrom got some shrapnel thro the sleeve of his coat &amp; is very nervy. While waiting for cases outside of R.A.P., we noticed two fellows just on the brow of the hill fall after a H.E. burst, 4 of us doubled up quick as possible to investigate, both were only slightly wounded &ndash; one fellows helmet undoubtedly saved him. Whilst bandaging them, we were under observation &ndash; Fritz sent over more H.E. &amp; shrapnel &ndash; I thought my time had come &ndash; got them in safely &ndash; so much for the respect to Red Cross men. Were relieved about 6 pm by the 7th F. Amb &amp; believe we the Division is going out for a spell &ndash; Going home we were all tired, foot sore &amp; weary, but we had to hickory as Fritz followed us up with shrapnel. Had a good feed of hot stew when we got to the dump &ndash; also issued with a cake of chocolate &amp; rum &ndash; had a very fair sleep.</p>
