Dear Ones,
The scene is changed again.  I am not waiting with Len Valentine for a Concert begin at the above address.  Ellis is at Home in the dismal Hut, smoking by the Fireside.  I can't bear that sort of thing.  It has been a lovely Day & we are supposed to be leaving here on Friday.  Still address our letters in the same way.  I sent most of my Private gear to Auntie & the little remainder to Mr. Edmonds.  There is not very much doing that I can tell you about.  Ellis met Billy Ali last night.  I'll see Him to-morrow, D.V.  I had a lovely time with Auntie, Uncle, Granma & Marie.  Oh, they are lovely.  I love them all so very dearly.  Auntie & Marie are just the loveliest ones on Earth next to my own sweet Darling Mum.  Well, Dear Dad, Mum & George, this concert begins so I say Good-night.
Best LoveHarry.
