 Stenwerck La Becqu 4/7/16 Near Jesus Farm the 23rd had their cooker all at work readi to dish up a meal of bacon tea . Lay down on the ground and had a long wait until about 4 am . Near all of us were fast asleep lie in equip . Rous and push on in the grow dawn , all the men labour hard under their heavi pack and feel the foot sore veri much . Pass shower wet us as we came into Stenwerck . This is a quaint littl town with a fine church . The sound of bell ring was home like . From here the countri becom remark pretti and much like Roquetoir . All the wheat and oat crop are heavi in ear and there are also acr of bean and other green . The whole landscap is a delight emerald green most rest to the eye . Wind road and lane with hedg and tree fring brook add to the delight of this scene . The hous are all old and pretti look veri neat and comfort and not blown about and ruin like those we are by now quit use to see . On the outskirt of the town we got into singl file and wound our way through a pretti littl overrun path and them among the grow crop . The fellow were just about done up by now and could hard struggl into the billet . To our disgust the billet we were to put the men in was a barn that was not fit to be the habit of pig far less of men . A lousi filthi place wet and reek . To crown all after their 10 mile march there was no breakfast ! The transport had been mess up with contradictori order and there was no food for the boy . I was rage storm up to the C.O. and got thing proper stir up . Gave Sgt 20 franc to buy food for the men and later went out in heavi rain and allot decent billet to which we move later ! As soon as possibl after arriv all threw themselv down on hard floor and slept like top without ani cover at all . Harden veteran now . A notic featur in the field was littl thatch haycock like stook of hay , some of the build farmhous c. are veri old and bear the date on their wall by mean of light colour brick let in to the brickwork . The littl shrine by the roadsid in some case look veri old but the earliest date notic on one was 1852 . In the cemeteri one notic that all tombston are wooden and date all recent . This is account for by the fact that the ground continu be reus the grave be all dug up everi five year and the bone remov . No one is allow to buy land in perpetu here .
