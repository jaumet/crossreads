  
 June 23 a few weeks leave & have a jolly good time. Still it makes a fellow feel damned wild for being left at the last moment almost. Beautiful Weather too, altho' even that fails to cheer a fellow up any!. Most of the other Harefield chaps are listed safely. Rec'd 3 letters today - all wishing me "Bon Voyage" ! 'Later"  Just been told to get ready to leave tm'w morning so am still hoping hard. 
 24 Drill & like rain, with a cold wind. Still worse luck. Name not on the boat roll & my kit has gone on the train but
