I am hopeful that you have let the rooms, when so many enquiries were being made there must have been chance for some one to suit them. I hope Kelty will not be so silly as to leave Sydney; those who stay at home are just as necessary as those who are coming away. 
 Joseph dear: Your earlier letter bers date 17.7.15. for it much thanks. It was sad that Haemish Paton had to turn back at Fremantle. His father told me of it in his Letter just received.
