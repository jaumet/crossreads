<p>6th October &ndash; Friday<br/>Hot &amp; close &amp; has been so for at least 4 days.  This sort of weather freezing cold, then rain &amp; hot makes one always uncomfortable.  An order read to us by our intelligent officer to cut down our letters, too lazy to censor them.  This is about the greatest insult I have had offered me.  Nothing of note to-day.</p>
<p>7th October &ndash; Saturday<br/>A cold day &amp; windy but after work at 12-30, lunch &amp; a most pleasant &amp; interesting afternoon.  With Palliser &amp; Legge, at 2 p.m. we go to the Museum</p>
