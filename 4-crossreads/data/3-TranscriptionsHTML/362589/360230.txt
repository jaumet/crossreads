<p>them off for active work. These sounds, the occasional sight of men in khaki, and an aeroplane flying across every few days, are the only indications that the country is not in its usual state of complacent agricultural industry.<br/>I hope by next time I write I shall be in the midst of my work. I leave here on Friday &amp; return to Hendon. Within a week I expect to be settled down to it.<br/>This week's mail is a particularly heavy one and I have taken advantage of the last two rainy days to write almost continuously. I am beginning to feel the strain.<br/>Glad to hear that the Lismore Circuit trip was a success and that Howards is doing well. I also hope to get news of Keith's movements soon.<br/>With kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson<br/>Yours very sincerely<br/><u>Lowman Whitfielding</u></p>
