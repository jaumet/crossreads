<p>Another lovely morning &amp; plenty of sunshine the nights are very cold now but we have had remarkably little rain.  Things have quietened down considerably in the Town, the excitement is fast disappearing.<br/>There has been a lot of joking &amp; larking in our hut this morning they have been pulling Vernon's leg unmercifully &amp; he has been biting like one thing.  First of all they hid his cigarettes, then he had some water heating on the fire &amp; while his back was turned they took it nearly all out, left about a cup-full &amp; finally planted his walking stick.  Lord how wild he was but this was just what we wanted &amp; we nearly killed ourselves laughing.</p>
<p>14th.  Miss Nissen &amp; I went to the little Repertory Theatre last night &amp; very good it was but the smallest I have ever seen we had Stalls cost 3/- &amp; there were not more than 100 seats available in this part, the people</p>
