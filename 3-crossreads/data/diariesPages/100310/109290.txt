30/8/17 Campagne and Renescure 
Went over to Renescure at 10am and sat with General Wisdom 4 Colonels on a G.C.M trying a Captain of the Provost Corps. Some of the M.P witnesses were terrible people ? fat cold footed perjurers. Had lunch at 7th BHQ in an old fashioned castle like place with a moat round it. A date 1472 over the door but the whole place shows signs of very much rebuilding and renovation. Lots of little turrets towers. Mullioned windows. Our Court sat in an old meeting room elsewhere on the walls were photos of past Republic presidents and a plaque of war of the female figment symbolical of "Republique Francaises". After dinner corrected a number of maps sent in by the Intelligence officer done by our privates. The regimental buglers played a very fine ?Last Post"at 10 p.m. Am anxiously awaiting word of my application for Italian leave and do hope it soon arrives. Harricks leaves for the 6th I.B. in a few days for 6 months.
