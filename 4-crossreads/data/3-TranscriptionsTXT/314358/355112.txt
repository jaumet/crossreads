is nearer to me than yesterday with an intensity defying all forgetfulness, I feel that when we see what others have done through and suffered and lost; and the terrible things which young lives have endured; that after all (not for ourselves dear); all things may be for the best.
Don't mind me mentioning this dear, as I have no one to talk to. Time teaches us to accept our fate and perhaps to understand a little, but memory allows of more of the tapestries of the past to be completely covered up.The hard old world teaches forgetfulness which it knows can not lie learnt forgetting that the dearest memories are helping the saddest ones of all.
Dont think I look on the dull side of life dear, for I am now too old for that.With years we human things pass into the memoires lives provided our lives are not over vicious. Early instilled goodness asserts its enobling power, and we value our parents unselfish care of our childhood moves the further old time leads us away from that happy period.
