March 191730th.   Early this morning I was instructed to take a party of seven sappers & L. Cpl Durkin to Bernafay Wood & report to the adjutant at "C.R.E."   We left Villers-Au-Floss at about 8.30 a.m. with all our gear a proceeded on our journey.   At Beaulencourt we got a truck on which we loaded our gear, and took it along the "light railway" as far as Ginchy, & from there we had to carry it to Bernafay Wood & arrived at H.Q. about 4 P.M.It had been raining nearly all day & we were all the worse for a wetting & tired out.   After settling down I received instructions as to the work we are to do, to the effect that in the morning we are to dismantle a number of"Bow Huts"
