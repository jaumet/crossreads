scorching blistering skies, amid rocks & precipices, poison thorn bushes & jagged flint strewn ravines:  where the little grey speckled flies swarm in myriads to torment the wounded to madness & thirst, heat & dust bake a fallen man's throat until it is black & his tongue turns to stirrup leather."
Monday 1st Nov. 1915
A quiet night day, but had a hell of a gale about 7 o'clock at night.  It came without warning from the SE & hissed & tore around us for a full half hour.  The air was full of flying pebbles & pockets of dust & debris & stung & wounded the faces & hands of those who were had been unfortunate enough not to secure timely shelter.  The sea raged & roared & tossed huge breakers on to the sandy shore.  Many boats & lighters were unable to withstand its fury, & were driven on to the shallows & aground.
Tuesday 2nd Nov 1915
The morning broke calm, with not a breath of wind, & the sea had quietened considerably though still heaving & swelling from its overnight struggles.  One paddle steamer - a tug - lay high & dry on the beach below No. 2 Post & the Turks lost no time in getting on to it with big shells, but they made very poor practice.  They also turned the machine guns on to the men aboard her & they were compulsorily obliged to abandon her.
