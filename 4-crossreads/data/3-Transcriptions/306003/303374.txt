<p>31-5-16<br/>prisoners, it is said the aeroplane dropped some bombs on the retreating Turks;  At 11.30 we left for Oghratina &amp; arrived there at 1 oclock, had dinner &amp; fed &amp; watered the horses &amp; left Oghratina at 4 oclock for camp &amp; had a good trip in;  Most of the lads have had a lot of outpost duty &amp; guards &amp; fatigues since leaving camp the night before last &amp; have had practically no time for sleeping &amp; are about knocked up, but I have rather enjoyed the trip.  We arrived in camp at 8.30 had tea &amp; bully beef before getting to bed</p>
<p>1-6-16<br/>Thurs 1st<br/>Had quite an exciting time this morning which put more life into us than a days sleep;  Reveille at 3.30 as usual &amp; had finished doing stables &amp; waiting for the cooks to sing out for the mess orderlies for breakfast when the burr of an aeroplane was heard</p>
