<p>carrying on our work. At 10 o'clock I was put on a job to make a set of pigeon holes for C.R.E. which took me until knock off time at 4 o'clock. Nasty working as the rain beat in all the time on our workshop and very gusty. Soon after tea I turned in and we got our stove going and it warmed the hut up beautifully. I had a rotten headache and a bit of a toothache and didn't feel at all well. pat to-day and also got a letter from Melv and 2 chronicles. Of course, several came home merry.<br/>31.8.16 felt a good bit better to-day and it is quite sunny and beautiful out although a bit wet yet. We were carting fascines of logs all the morning in the slush about 6" deep and it wasn't pleasant. Our section clerk to-day went into the canteen and purchased articles for the cook each putting in two francs. I also bought some envelopes. In the afternoon we loaded a waggon with roofing for headquarters and took some wood over to be sawn up. Knocked off at 4 and wrote some letters to Melv, Mother &amp; Auntie Sarah. After tea I had a bonza steam bath and afterwards put my coat on and wrote long letter to Melv outside. Went to bed but couldn't sleep until about 11 as poker was in progress and Day came home dead drunk and had to be carried in. Slept well.<br/>1.8.16 First parade at 6.30 this morning Reveille being at 6. The sergeant major was up the pole and ordered in future that everybody was to be up at reveille and clean billets and parade in full drill order. First parade at 8. No time for anything. We have to supply 1000 duckboards a day from this yard and I suppose this explains the earlier hours. I was lumping wood all day in working h hours which were from 8 to 12.10 and 12.55 to 5. Wrote to Mother, Sarah, &amp; Winzor in the electric light and turned in and had a fine sleep.<br/>2.8.16 <strike>Marchin</strike> Drill order at 6.25 but didn't clean our hut till after breakfast. Only got 250 duckboards done yesterday. At 8 o'clock I was selected to fix new blinds at Divisional Headquarters and after getting material rode over on the bikes about 3 miles away and got to work. Capt Dean came in from the trenches and we spoke for a while. The work was done in the offices first and in the typewriting room the casualty list was being made out. IN another hut was the plans and men were coping from them. Some were marked 'secret' displayed so that everyone who came in could get a good look at them. Knocked off at 11.25 and came home to dinner. Carried on in the afternoon and knocked off at 4.30. Pudding for tea. New crowd of reinforcements and about 12 for this company including Ludlow and Watson. Wrote letters until 10.30 and was just sleeping well when a gas alarm went. The siren whistled continuously and someone was banging our shell case and all the church bells were ringing violently. Luckily no gas came over our way. Slept very well afterwards.<br/>3.9.16 Picked for guard this morning and didn't go on second parade and hope to get some letters written but was only able to write one letter. Usual guard duties 3rd relief and plenty of officers to salute.</p>
