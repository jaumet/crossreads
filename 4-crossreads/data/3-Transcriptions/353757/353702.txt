<p>want the wife to know.  To make matters worse, someone wrote &amp; told her I was half dead &amp; "hopelessly disfigured for life".  That's no joke, you know.  My left leg is turned a bit &amp; my head slightly on one side, that's all;  can't notice it.  When writing, address Corporal A. Hine as it facilitates delivery to have them a/d correctly.</p>
<p>Will write again soon as possible.</p>
<p>Your cobber till lights out<br/>A. Hine</p>
<p>P.S.  You'll understand, old Cock, that sometimes its impossible to reply to letters for weeks &amp; months so you'll excuse irregularity of letters &amp; the disjointed nature thereof.  I have a very stiff right arm where I got my wrist twisted.</p>
<p>Kind regards to your kindhearted Mum, also Violet &amp; Molesworth Senrs.</p>
