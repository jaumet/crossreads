men have to go backwards forwards all day long through this awful stuff, a couple of trips through it you are nearly knocked out for it is terrible hard work pulling yourself through the sticky clay, the 6th Bn are in an awful place nearly up to your arm pits still men stick it, but if it is bad for us what must it be like for Fritz for he has 10 times the amount of shell fire to contend with than us, 6 of them gave themselves up last night, they could not stand it any longer.
It has turned out rather a nice day, this evening the sky is thick with shells aeroplanes balloons, they brought one of ours down by shell fire we shot one of theirs down so honors are even but we have 20 times as many up as Fritz We are moving into the firing line tonight just at present they are shelling our Hqts
