  
 November 1916 26th   The rain increased during the night & has  been  continued all day.  It is soking into the ground & most of our "dugouts" are suffering The dump is growing in size & now occupies a fairly large space of ground.  Fritz has been shelling us very freely since last night.  Some have landed very close to us & he is continuing it again to-night.  It is mostly "high explosive" but he gives us some schrapnell occasionally & it is anything but pleasant. The rain shows signs of clearing off but it is still very cold.
