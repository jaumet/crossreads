<p>It seems as though this war will never terminate when one sees the thousands of troops that are yet [left]</p>
<p>10 April 1916 Mon<br/>It is 2 am as I write these few words &amp; as I look up &amp; out towards the firing line I see the signals &amp; reflections of the big guns &amp; the noise of them is terrific. Some poor beggars are getting it to-night. Ken &amp; myself pay a visit to see Lawrence indulging in light refreshments. Saw Horace Bircher coming through the town.</p>
<p>11 April 1916 Tues<br/>Went around to the estaminet at 6.30 am for coffee with Marshall Rice. After breakfast Ken &amp; I spent the best part of the morning with Germaine &amp; Lawrence. Slept in the afternoon. Ken takes our photoes in the back yard of the estaminet. Beautiful singing by a tommie of Sheffield Choir [tone]</p>
