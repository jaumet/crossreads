"Goodbye Australia"
S.S. Mongolia July 9th 1916.
I
Thy bold outlines growing dimmer, in the sunset's golden glimmer
Jutting headland, rocky slope and winding bay
And the troops are gathered forward, with strained eyes gazing shoreward,
Just to catch the last glimpse fading with the day.
2
For a passionate devotion, strong and boundless as the ocean,
For a Home of Homelands, glorious and Free
With a solemn strange insistence, as we swing out in the distance
Thrills our hearts anew with sacred love to thee.
3
All the tender ties that bind us. All the memories that remind us
Of thy Shores, thy sun kissed lands, thy beauty rare
Every golden recollection, stirring chords of deep affection
Builds anew the heart's High Throne, and sets thee there.
