<p>Dear old Mick,</p>
<p>Your letters of the 1st and 8th of February duly received and very much appreciated.  You don't know what it feels like to get letters from home, especially in this kind of a joint.  So you can get busy, old man, and write to your old pal in your spare moments.</p>
<p>Ere you get this you will be well in to your first term of your most important year at school.  Of course, there is no need for me to wish you good luck, I will be constantly interested in your work right through the year.  So don't forget all particulars of your work etc.</p>
