A big No. of our bearers are sick or suffering from shell shock, so we had to fall back on the Nursing Sec. to give us a hand. "Dodds" and Jim Eldridge are with us, and a No. of others are with the other parties. We intended to make a stew for dinner, with B. but couldn't find any wood for the fire. The Inf. Battns. were changing over this afternoon and Fritz had a sausage up. He very soon sent over a supply of shells and got quite a No. of ?em. Two chaps came to our post, one with a foot blown off, the other with a piece of shrapnel through his chin and up into his mouth splitting the tongue. Capt. Irving fixed up the Jaw case, and "Thomas" fixed up the leg case in good style. There are guns everywhere and they are banging away night and day. There is a Battery on top of our dug-out and it is belching away while I am writing. Fritz is getting a bit of his own back now, as he never gets any peace from our gunners. They have an unlimited supply of shells and keep worrying him all the time. We had another smack about 3, then Capt. Nance arrived and said the party who were resting could come out to this Post North Road and relieve the 15th who have been on for 48 hours. Capt. Irving has a sledge going drawn by 2 horses, but I don't know whether it will be a success or not. There are 15 of us in this dug-out and the place is crowded. Things are fairly quiet. It is now about 9, and we have only had 3 walking cases, so we are hoping there wont be any more till day light. On our way out, we passed another poor chap who was killed in the bombardment this afternoon. It is rotten not being able to write any letters. Poor old B.C. will be wondering what is wrong. Gee? we've got an awful long time to make up for. It was awfully cold during the night, and we kuddled together like a lot of sick fowls, trying to get warm, luckily we had no cases, but No. 2 party were kept going most of the night.
