 Dear old Hec, 
 I have been in England 3 months now and have quite recovered from my wound through the shoulder.  I have had a great time in England especially when I was at Bristol.  When I go out on furlough I will be going back to Bristol as some people have asked me to stay with them.  England is a nice interesting place but the climate is rotten it is nearly always raining here, it must agree with my health for I weigh 11 stone 2 lbs.  I would love to know how you got on this harvest.  I was sorry 'Captain' died he was a good horse for work.  I would love to be farming again with you. 
 I was in London last week and had a good time although I didn't know where I was half my time.  I saw Trefalgar [Trafalgar] square so I suppose I was knocking about Piccadilly, Pall Mall and Regent St. etc., of course I was with a mate but he was as green as I.  London is kept fairly dark now on account of the zepps.
