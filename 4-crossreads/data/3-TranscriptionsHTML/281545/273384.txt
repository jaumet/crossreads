<p>able as possible, I thoroughly enjoyed my ride through several Towns, the first I passed was Borre, then Strazeele, the Bailleau.  The Roads are all <strike>cobbled</strike> made of Cobble stones &amp; splendid to ride over, I saw French Boys &amp; Girls skating on the Ice in several places, where the water holes were frozen.   Borre is only a small village, but Strazeele was a fair size place, &amp; Bailleau was a large <strike>city</strike> Town &amp; is full of Australian Troops.  On arrival in the Square I got off the Lorry after thanking the Driver &amp; walked along the Steinwerck Road down hill when along came an Australian Motor Lorry No 3 Division &amp; the Driver gave me a lift right into Steinwerck arriving there at 3-15 Pm.   I made straight for the Motor Workshops &amp; found my Brother busy fixing up electric lights on the stage &amp; in the hall of their Recreation Room.  He did not expect me although I wrote him a letter 10 days before telling him of my intended visit but he never received it.  As he was very busy I sat by the Store until he finished at 5 Pm, when we went over to the Cookhouse for Tea which consisted of Bread &amp; Cheese &amp; Jam &amp; a Pot of Tea.  After Tea I went back with him to the Hall as he had to finish the wiring</p>
