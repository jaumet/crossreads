<p>August 4<br/>295.<br/>Morning to the Ambulance, there dinner with A. Sub., in the afternoon to the Canal, and bathing, with green dark water, straight <strike>lined</strike> banked by steep terraced grass banks, <strike>and</strike> guarded by tall trees:  and a long springboard, and a hundred men bathing.</p>
<p>The carnival of tonight postponed, tomorrow at 10 to see its commencement.</p>
<p>Yesterday a letter &ndash; and an account "941" from the T.B.C.  Brooke's verse invoice dates July 31.</p>
<p>In the afternoon from Basil a book of the verse of Miss Forest:  its fly-page scribed &ndash;</p>
<p>"Glad the song o'er the land shall flow<br/>By peaceful farmhouse, and flower tall glades,<br/>But the bravest thing,<br/>(as all men know,)<br/>Was the way that the song was made.</p>
<p>From "A Song of Peace", M. Forest, [Mabel Forrest] Bulletin, Brisbane, April 13, 1918.</p>
<p>August 4, 5<br/>296.<br/>Our Billet, the loft of a long barn by the Church, the Div. observers and 'Maps'.  Reading last night, and completed to the beating of the electric light engine, Hauptmann's "Vor Sonnenaufgang" [Before Sunrise] &ndash; the first of the plays of Vol. 1.  A splendid play, and good reading, its dialogue strangely natural, and the art of the love scene exceptionally good:  the conclusion perfect too, and well handled.</p>
<p>August 5<br/>297.<br/>The canal, with the 1st Bde. Carnival in progress by de Chavannes.  A morning of grey, a haze of twilight low above the ground.</p>
<p>In a small house by the station, coffee:  refugees from La Motte, and one a girl of 17 &ndash; the colour of the sun's gold in her deep hair, and on her face and boyishly muscled neck and shoulders &ndash; drawn after Lord Leighton's "Juggling Girl".</p>
<p>The relay won by the 4th and some good swimming:  2nd came in a bad fourth.</p>
