<p>Thursday 26th November Anno Domini 1914. This morning we left Aden. It is rumoured that the Sydney has destroyed a fort some little distance from Per[indecipherable]; in fact the alleged remains of the said fort were pointed out to me this afternoon. It now transpires that the Sydney did not go back to Aus</p>
<p>at all. We passed Perim this afternoon. It is a small naval station just a few buildings scattered over what appears to be a very barren island. The buildings are white and there is a lighthouse at one end of the island. I have heard that there are 250 000 Turks within 100 miles of the Suez and that there are 14 000 British troops guarding it. Another rumour is to the effect that we are going to Egypt. The Arabian coastline is made up of a succession of sandy stretches and bleak precipitous rocky bluffs. A stunted growth of some vegetable life appears grow on the sand. From the shoreline the sandy stretches recede to rocky precipitous mountains scarcely distinguishable from the cloudy background.</p>
