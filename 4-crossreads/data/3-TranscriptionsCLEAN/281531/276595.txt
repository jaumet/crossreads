8/8/18Villers-Bretonneuxa Hun. The road was now thronged with guns and limbers and all kinds of transport. We passed along passing several badly wounded men limping along with the help of others. Outside a little Dressing station was a group of Huns. One had been struck through the face and kept raising and lowering himself on his stretcher groaning with agony. Others all bloody also lay around. A little further on lay what appeared to be a long dead German corpse with a dreadful face all torn about. While looking at it one of its hands raised and lowered itself. A Hun plane did a daring reconnaissance & was forced back by one of ours. Passing over our front line the smell of phosphorus from our "few hours ago" bombardment was very noticeable.
