Porridge w/- plenty of milk & Ham & Eggs or Poached eggs on toast or omelette for Breakfast every morning, oh lor! it breaks my poor old heart when I think of what we had to leave.Well, as all good things must come to an end so our great holiday finished one fine day at noon.The Bde. Captain rode up to our O.C. & asked if he could be ready to move in two hours & if so the motor Buses would be at the farm at 2 p.m.These Buses carted us to a spot just outside Ypres, "Belgian Battery Corner" or "Chateau Belge".
