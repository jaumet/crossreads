 Saturday 4 Nov. 1916 Up at &frac14; past 3 &amp; had a long tramp with the General, meeting Colonel Blamey &amp; Cuthbert. Heard from latter that his brother died of wounds 2 days previously. Back about 9 &amp; pottering about during the day, abt. 3 o'c. in the afternoon having to again go up the line to select a site for a forward dump. Ran into some hot artillery fire &amp; had several very narrow escapes, coming through, however, untouched &amp; thankful to reach home about 7 o'c.
