 Friday 18 Januari Weather dull . A walk to Neuv Eglise look over the ruin . The place has been much knock about sinc June 16 but is not shell much now , sinc Messin Ridg is in British hand . Saturday 19 Januari This morn a balloon at Neuv Eglise broke away from it moor float away over the Bosch line . The observor came out in parachut , our anti aircraft gun tri by veri rotten shoot to destroy the sausag in vain . Weather cloudi . Heavi bombard on the right .
