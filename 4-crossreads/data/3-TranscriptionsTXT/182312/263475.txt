 of two main saps in the Armentiers district which rejoiced in the 
 title of &quot;Belfields Corner&quot;.&nbsp; Dugouts also come in for a variety 
 of names.&nbsp; First there is the British type of dugout which 
 suggests the labours of an elderly xxxxxx hen trying to scratch 
 herself a good place to sit down on.&nbsp; And there is the Boche 
 type, which suggests a subterranean villa at Daceyville, only less

 have long since been abandoned in France and their place taken by 
 Huts.&nbsp; These huts are roomy and comfortable and each is fitted 
 with a stove for warming purposes.&nbsp; To keep them out of the mud, 
 they are built upon stilts and each hut is connected up with duck 
 walks so that one is able to walk to any hut in the camp without 
 having to struggle with the mud.&nbsp; Duckboards, by the way, are 
 made in sections of about 7 feet long and 2 feet wide by nailing 
 pieces of 3&quot; X 1&quot; timber with inch spaces, to two pieces of 
 parallel battening placed two feet apart.&nbsp; There are hundreds
