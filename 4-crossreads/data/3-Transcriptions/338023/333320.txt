<p>In case you do not get the letters preceding this I give the address  <u>in full</u>  as far as I am permitted to do; In fact all my letters will have it for a while &ndash; then you will be pretty sure of getting the change. At the same time, perhaps, it would be as well for you to send them "civvy" style, c/o Mrs Horton &ndash; they know my movements and will always be able to send on to me. Have not heard from C. since he wrote to tell me that he had come down the line &amp; was OK. By judicious use of our influ. with the rulers of our late "school"</p>
<p>[the following is written sideways along the margin:]<br/>with love to all &amp; thanks for portrait of [Cronge?] just received! most especially Home</p>
