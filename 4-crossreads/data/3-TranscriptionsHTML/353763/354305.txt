<p>Thursday Nov 5 &ndash; 14  We are still coaling  -  The collier we are alongside has a suspicious history  -  She is the Cairnhill &ndash; the same steamer that, some months back broke her shaft &amp; drifted &ndash; up New Ireland way  -  Eventually she was picked up &amp; towed to Townsville  -  One of the destroyers or battle ships picked her up outside Suva &amp; went aboard &amp; examined her papers &amp; found that her cargo &ndash; 6000 tons of coal &ndash; was consigned &ndash; ostensibly &ndash; to a German firm in San Francisco  -  She was ordered into Suva with the result that all her coal is commandeered &amp; the fleet benefits  -  That's the yarn anyway  -  Buz has it that the German cruisers wd  have intercepted her &amp; taken the coal &amp; that that was her <u>real</u> job of work  -  In the aftn  of yesterday I witnessed a cricket match between the Grantala &amp; the Fijian constabulary  -  The latter were by far the better team  -  They outplayed the Grantala in every department of the game  -  The Fijians were fine specimens of Natives &ndash; bare legged &amp; bare footed but when batting they put on pads &amp; used gloves for wicket keeping &amp; played an A1 game  -  Their bit hitting roused great enthusiasm  -  No wicket for over 100  -</p>
