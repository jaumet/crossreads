<p>Monday, 21st:<br/>Wrote "Boys of Australia's Clime" as a sally to the ship's song "Boys of the Aberdeen Line", and put it in the hands of the ship's printer.</p>
<p>6 a.m. Land in sight, but so faint as to be hardly discernible from the horizoned clouds.</p>
<p>9 a.m. Great jagged mountains of rock jutting out clear from the sea. Nothing but pink brown except where the dentations are marked with shadowy mauve. Tried my hand at sketching---I have almost forgotten how to hold a pencil---and managed to get a bit "Gulf of Aden." But the best thing was the great pile of rock that hides the town. It rose sheer, a big massive thing like a giant of the Flinders on a burning day---a king of mountains raising his jagged crown above all else around him, as though he would take first of the homage of everything---even of the great blazing King of the blue above.</p>
<p>Seven or eight vessels passed us including one transport (empty) going home for troops, and three British loaded transports on the way to Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>The great peaks seem to grow more and more cruel looking. But in all their cruelty and fireceness and barren harshness there is a pride and magnificence that seems almost conscious.</p>
<p>Passed the Island of Perim towards dark. Just enough light to see the settlement and lighthouse.</p>
<p>Signal came from the gunboat in harbour (Morse lamp). What ship? Are you transport? Where from?</p>
