<p>Decembre 26<br/>Still snowing snowing heavily at intervals. We have had about a 6" fall of snow! We are not doing any training &ndash; just trying to have as good a Xmas as possible. This is the best Xmas we have had since coming away from home.</p>
<p>Decembre 27<br/>Had a trip to Boulogue today to get stores for our Sgts Mess. The roads are very slippery with snow &amp; ice making travelling very difficult. It is still very cold &amp; snowing at intervals. Our aeroplanes have bombed successfully some German towns on the Rhine. They are said to have caused much destruction.</p>
