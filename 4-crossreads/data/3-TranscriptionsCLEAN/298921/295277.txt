  
 November, 1915  3 Nov.15  From my Dugout I can see the War ships manoeuvreing & firing - aeroplanes both friendly & German in the air with little puffs of smoke shewing the shrapnel bursting around & the men below, digging or cooking taking everything as a matter of course & quite happy - We wish you all a Merry Christmas & hope to be with you all again ere another comes round. Cup day - We have a sweep by Nos not knowing the names of the horses.
