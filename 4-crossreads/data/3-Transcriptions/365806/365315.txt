<p>lost confidence in Hughes.</p>
<p>We are living in luxury at present in a most comfortable German dugout.  The office is situated in a great big cellar of an old Chateau and there are still 2 more series of dugouts further down, quite well ventilated and all beautifully panelled.  Some of the rooms still contain some of the original furniture.  It is quite a show place and all the spare generals in the country stray over here to look at it.  I have also seen some "taupe" derelict ones but still wonderfully intact.  It must take a good deal to knock them out, for these fellows are used as ranging marks by the Germans but show little more than a few cracked plates and dinged catterpillar wheels.  I haven't had any more flys yet, indeed in these times of high winds one doesnt altogether envy them.  This is just a scrap to say that I shall be thinking of you all at Christmas time and wishing you well.  Please give my love to Mrs. Ferguson.<br/>Yours affectionately,<br/>Walter</p>
