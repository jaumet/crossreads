<p>consists of the 5th, 6th, and 7th Brigades (i.e. Battalions from</p>
<p>17th to 28th inclusive), and had preceded us by a week but instead</p>
<p>of halting at a base had gone straight up to Billets at the front.</p>
<p>Our job is to keep the 2nd. Division reinforced and they have only</p>
<p>to telephone down for whatever men or officers they want and they</p>
<p>get them next morning.&nbsp; Meantime we are continuing training within</p>
<p>sound of the guns.&nbsp; Our training here is more practical than in</p>
<p>Egypt and consists in Bayonet work, trench work, machine guns and</p>
<p>bombing.&nbsp; Every man is made thoroughly conversant with the type of</p>
<p>machine gun now in use and each of the officers must be capable of</p>
<p>acting as &#39;machine gun officer&#39; should occasion warrant it.&nbsp; Bombing</p>
<p>is very interesting work and is carried out entirely with live bombs.</p>
<p>One soon gets used to holding a fizzing bomb in one&#39;s hand knowing</p>
<p>that in three seconds it is going to tear a hole in the earth large</p>
<p>enough to bury an elephant.&nbsp; A longer fuse than this gives the enemy</p>
<p>a chance to pick up the bomb and throw it clear.&nbsp; You are casually</p>
<p>told by the instructor that owing to the unskilled labour now being</p>
<p>employed in making the bombs in England the fuses cannot be depended</p>
<p>upon, and they might go off any time.&nbsp; They are supposed to be timed</p>
<p>for 5 seconds, and to make sure that the enemy has not time to throw</p>
<p>it back you ignite and retain it 2 seconds in your hand before throw-</p>
<p>ing.&nbsp; At first your eagerness to get rid of the beastly thing immed-</p>
<p>iately after lighting is irrepressible - particularly after you have</p>
<p>heard of the uncertain fuses - but you soon get used to it and I have</p>
<p>seen chaps hold them to their ears to hear if the fuse was burning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weather was beastly cold, wet and windy when we arrived and</p>
<p>we suffered rather severely from this combination, more particularly</p>
