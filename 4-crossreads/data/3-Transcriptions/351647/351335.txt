<p>Dear Mrs. John,</p>
<p>Got a letter from you early in the week but it was an old one, January, I think &amp; readdressed from the Infantry.  I am hoping you get the right address soon as I feel sure I'm missing a lot.  I know they are numbered but when they arrive so madly I can't keep count of what I have &amp; what I haven't had.</p>
<p>Things are still not too bad in some ways &amp; rotten in others.  This old Brigade is getting rather strafed these days &amp; we are rather hoping to soon be relieved &amp; have a spell-oh as we have had it solid for over three months now.  I'm not speaking for myself, I'm all right but some of our fellows who have to live up at the pits.  It is a strain.</p>
<p>Things are still very lively but we are doing great work &amp; have been complimented &amp; congratulated &amp;c., &amp;c.  It does make you feel glad &amp; proud to be an Australian, especially when one is here &amp; knows exactly what they</p>
