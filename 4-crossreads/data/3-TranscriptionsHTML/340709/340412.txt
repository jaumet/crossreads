<p>the dear old "Lili". It was fine to feel the grip of the wheel again. The smell of the exhaust, the rattle of the machinery, the inevitable breakdown all reminded me of happier days; days when my own men trod her decks &ndash; jolly good fellows every one of them. It made me feel a bit sad &amp; lonely to think that I was the only one left of that gallant &amp; intrepid (eh! what?) crew. But the days of piracy are over. No more can we rush through the water at 4 &frac34; knots &amp; strike terror into the hearts of our enemies &ndash; who usually proved to be the best of friends.<br/>When I arrived alongside the "Gabriel" at Alexis Awu's black face appeared over the rail with a cannibalistic smile of welcome, while the old bo'sun touched his cap and grinned cordially. Oh, I'm the captain of the "Pina&mdash;" (but I think I've said that before).<br/>On our way back we passed the "Genoa" proceeding under sail to Madang.<br/>Last night the "Warrego" &amp; "Yarra" returned to port, the "Yarra" again leaving before daylight this morning.<br/>Wed 6th : A lazy day. Doing nothing but waiting for the "Parramatta". The "Yarra", "Warrego" &amp; "Nusa" are here.</p>
