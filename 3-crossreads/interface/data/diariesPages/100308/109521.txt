We have had some wonderful characters in the regiment, most of them have left since Gallipoli. A few come to mind "Tucker" Vienna Killed at Pozieres The Old Grey Mare (Cunningham) Prisoner in Germany Bennett (Crippled) who lost his voice Geordie ONeill still here in Transport Sergt Pennie badly smashed up Old Pat Hannaberry Senile decay :Squeaker" Dyson. Malsworthy Smith ? "Allinga - man to dig in!" T. Rout now back in Australia.
Battn. passing another. Tired men coming out of the trenches:- "What mob are yer?" "Mob er goats" "Crise, I knows that without telling!"
(An old man would always answer one of these questions courteously particularly to a man coming out of the line ? etiquette. Reinforcements know no better).
Going in to do a stunt with many new men most of them must have felt nervous at the first experience. We passed a heavy battery full of flame and roar and one of the new chums turned to me and wistfully asked "Are we going into dugouts Sir?"
