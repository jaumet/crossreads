<p>Feb. Saturday 24 1917</p>
<p>The long expected &amp; talked of 9th &amp; 11th Batt, stunt comes off tonight. <br/>No one knew anything of the time till 6 p.m. &amp; great was the hurry. A feeling of tenseness is in the air as if we were on the eve of something big happening. Many fresh squads have been hurried up from Bazentin. I am unable to go being weak as a chicken. Go to bed but cannot sleep for nervous strain.</p>
