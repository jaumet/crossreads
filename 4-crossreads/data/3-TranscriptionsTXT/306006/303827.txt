17-4-17natural fortress in which the Turks had already entrenched for us, no phones used here & the lamps are busy tonight as all the messages are going through visually. One has to be careful walking about in the dark as this hill is very steep & the top a network of trenches around the bottom of the hill holes 7 or 8 feet deep are dug close together which take some negotiating, Upham fell down one tonight but was not hurt; The bombardment tonight is the heaviest I have heard; Two Taubes came over just before sundown & emptied a few drums of ammunition at us but hit no one; The 2nd Regt have to tranmit all message through us
