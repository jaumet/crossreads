<p>31/5/17 Bouzincourt<br/>Marie works about 14 hours a day poor girl from dawn to dark constantly on her feet. Her last task was loading dung on a cart. A comely pretty girl &ndash; is it any wonder that Paris streets claim so many rustic beauties. Here plain slavery &ndash; there ease and with pretty face, affluence for a while. Long hours are the lot of all farmworkers here.</p>
<p>1/6/17<br/>Usual routine with some bomb throwing (live) added to lecture &amp; demonstration to two companies in rapid wiring and the construction of strong posts. A couple of orderly room cases A.W.L.  Lewis gunners hard at their job, scouts and observers on theirs too. At the Chateau poor little Christien is kept hard at it from class to Mass and  from Mass to class and M. le Cure attends nearly all day at the house. More than one person will thank God that premier Communions are not too often!. Being the night after paynight there was plenty zig zag and husky voices in fierce argument sent up barrages of bad language alround.</p>
