Getting Reg. office sandbagged up to keep wind out, but two windows to be left to allow sea to be seen from here Remainder of day very quiet spent it reading until 1530 when called to Bde for orders. Orders issued for a big ruse or demonstration in which the whole Army Corps is participating. 
All hands will stand to in dark at 0400 in the morning and on rockets, will belt lead into Abdul. Then with bayonets and dummies sounds with tins followed by cheers and whistles, orders shouted c. should frighten 6 months growth out of our coloured friends and we hope to draw their fire ? artillery may land them a few ticklers too.
