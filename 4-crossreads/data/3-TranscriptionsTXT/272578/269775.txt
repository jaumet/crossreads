3rd June 1917. Left Bailleul this morning at 11 oclock and got to Steenwerck by motor. Stayed there for dinner and left for the wagon lines late afternoon. Later  on arrival got instructions to proceed to Battery. Waited till nightfall to move up to the position  succeeded in reaching position safely although Fritz sent a few shells amongst us. But we had to take the wagon with rations via another route & this led us into trouble. We ran into shells galore, blowing up of ammunition dumps & not forgetting gas shells. It was a lively half hour & was much relieved when we made our way back
