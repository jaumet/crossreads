<p>Thursday 30 May<br/>Last night Fritz burnt seven balloons about here, three French. Our people attacked this morning &amp; succeeded in wresting some posts from the Bosch, but with about sixty casualties. Glorious day again. News from the South shows the Bosch has advanced ten miles &amp; captured 15000 prisoners.</p>
<p>Friday 31 May<br/>Nothing of importance on this front. Another 1st Field man lightly wounded this morning.<br/>"Bob" Goldrick mentioned in despatches. News from the Champagne shows Fritz to have Soissons &amp; to have advanced about twenty miles almost to the Marne River.<br/>He is truly wonderful wresting from the French the hotly disputed possession of last year of the Chemin des Dames which cost the French such casualties, in a day.<br/>Even Paris is not absolutely safe.</p>
