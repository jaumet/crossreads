<p>Saturday 18 November 1916<br/>Col. Fuller at Brigade.<br/>Tents struck &amp; lines cleaned as usual.<br/>Match between Battle Squadron &amp; 6th this afternoon.  A drawn game.<br/>Word through that N.Z. are in touch with Enemy outside of Mazzaar.  We are on the verge of another scrap with the Enemy.  Something will soon have to be done as the line is getting too near Al Arish to be safe.  We will in all probability have to do the attacking &amp; clear the Turks further back.  The Military are determined to push the Railway through, &amp; to that end, are drawing up large supplies &amp; building Resoivours holding many thousands of Gallons of surplus water for the Troops.  We don't expect much until Chavel returns from England.  There is to be a Higher command shortly, &amp; an officer directing from France is appointed to take charge.  It will be known as the desert column.</p>
