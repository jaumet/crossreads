<p>in his own time instead of being put out, so took most of his stuff away. 1-8-18 We advanced our Post slightly last night to one we have been digging the last two nights. This morning just at dawn, Fritz put over first, a heavy barrage of trench mortars bombs &amp; shells. The first shell lobbed a few yards away from me, none of the others came so near, then came some gas, then a smoke cloud, which was so dense that I could not see five yards. We all thought he must be sure to come over, and I was quite expecting to have my first real fight it was quite exciting, we were all standing there, our heads over the parapet, rifle loaded, bayonet fixed, 100 rounds of ammunition at our right hand, a few bombs with the safety pin loosened, ready, peering out in front, &amp; trying to see a sigh of Fritz before he got too close, and he never came. We must have been an hour waiting there, then the bombardment ceased, the gas drifted away &amp; the sun came up &amp; since then has been a Sabbath calm &amp; one can hardly imagine there is a war on. No one was hurt</p>
