Walked about 1 1/4 mile. Dorothy, Sister O'Dwyer   &  self - one of the sledges is for us but we went of theirs, ours was not quite right.
We three had a glorious time but it was too short, had to hurry back to duty. Have not been able to go since, we are fearfully busy. The sick are simply crowding in   &  we cannot Evacuate quick enough, trains very busy.
I'm very well   &  eating anything.
