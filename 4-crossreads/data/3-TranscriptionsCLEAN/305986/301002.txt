all up to the neck in mud. 6.12.16 Encamped in huts in Mametz Wood. Huts are not bad, but the mud outside is some, we are well within range of shell fire and Fritz is putting a few strays over, had a march of 9 miles this morning and I nearly died, although I beat em for 3 by hopping on a Motor Lorry. Just went down to get our blankets but found the lorry they were on has been bogged in the mud 2 miles back, they may come up tonight, I hope so, if they don't we are going to do a freeze.
