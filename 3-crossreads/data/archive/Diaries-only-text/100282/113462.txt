Nice and fine this morning there is much aerial artillery activity things are waking up with the approach of Spring soon she will be in full swing again. The Tommy Officer who the lads arrested last night, turned out to be genuine, he was shaking like a leaf when they got him at Bn. Hqrs, our chaps must have put the "wind up" him properly.
Lately they have been issuing us with our bacon boiled instead of fried, its a rotten idea for no one can eat it on account of the fat. I made a complaint about it this morning, for the men only throw it away, dont know how far it will go.
25th. Beautiful sunny today its just lovely to see the sun again. Saw a bonza airfight this morning there were a few Fritzs knocking about
