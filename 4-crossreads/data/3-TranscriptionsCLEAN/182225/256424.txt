 1916   WEDNESDAY 1   NOV. 
 Fairly fine. Mother came in in the morning to see me & we went over the old Castle & St Giles Church & Holyrod Palace we also saw the heart of Midlothian. We got some more Xmas presents & then after dinner Mother went back to rest & I went out & saw Alan & spent the afternoon at the aerodrome. I came in in the side car with him & we all went out to the Jim Robertson's & had tea. I got the 10.20 pm train to London. Mother Alan Uncle & Auntie Jane were there to see me off. Edinburgh is not a bad place but did not have time to see it properly. Had a yarn to Admiral Beatty  in the Callie & came down with King Manuel of Portugal.
