It was funny down in the town tonight to see all the boys ducking in out of the butcher shops buying meat for a good feed, for we were all more or less meat hungry practically the whole Battalion was in, against "orders" too.
15th Sunday is round once more when we rose this morning at 5.30 it was raining heavily, but it turned out to be a shower only, I went over drew our rations for we were camped some little distance from the rest of the Coy. by the time we had breakfast the rain had stopped things looked lovely green. A lot of the boys got drunk here I had a terrible job to get them ready to move off in time, even then the Machine gunners left a roll of blankets
