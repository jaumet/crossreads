<p>My dear Judge<br/>I am back again in London after spending a very enjoyable five days in Scotland. We went to Inverness for two days &amp; spent the remainder on the time in Edinburgh.<br/>This morning I was summonsed before a Medical Board &amp; passed fir for general service. I report to Base camp on Saturday 6th &amp; shall probably got to France again a few days later.<br/>I have had a grand rest &amp; a splendid time over here &amp; am quite ready to go back to the Battalion now, even if I had any choice.</p>
