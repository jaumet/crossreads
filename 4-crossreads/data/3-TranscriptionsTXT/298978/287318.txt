MondayPouring with rain, ankle deep in mud everywhere, it is nearly a mile to the shower bath, slip down several times en route. Return from bath dirtier than before I went; very little water to use. Tired of being filthy.
Dec:Day's leave to get teeth seen to. Time spent on teeth, ten minutes. Meet Waterhouse damsel, take her out to tea - very nice. Meet Dick, who thinks it was all pre-arranged.
Dec:Drill. Writing
Dec: Day's leave for teeth again. Meet Waterhouse lady by accident; also Dick; he is now confident that it was all prearranged - gets quite rude about it. 6 p.m. tea with Dick. 8 p.m. Dick is out, Waterhouse lady arrives , not by accident . 11 p.m. return to camp
Dec: - 3 a.m.Reveille, 6 a.m. entrain for Williamstown - ranges all day firing.
Dec: SaturdayVisit Melbourne, meet Waterhouse girl. 11 p.m. return to camp.
Dec: 7 a.m. Holy Communion, most unusual for me. Tear off to Melbourne, visit Waterhouse lady - am asked, will I have dinner or would I like a bath; the usual question put to anybody coming from Broadmeadows Camp. Return to camp.
