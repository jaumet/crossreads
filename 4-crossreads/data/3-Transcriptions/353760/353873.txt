<p>March 8<br/>207.<br/>The village church &ndash; half its slates off and a few torn holes in its roof, and all its hipping and ridging torn from over the Apse &ndash; is very pathetick.  All over its tiled floor, old prayer chairs still stand grouped in huddled silent fear about a pew despoiled of its rain soiled plaster, or closely hug the low panelled walls.  The altar rail is of roughly carved oak, from the carvings the old hope arises that here is genuine peasant work, carved with enthusiasm and love, and still the red prayer cushion is half along its length.</p>
<p>The altars are broken, rain soiled and all despoiled, on the high altar still stands a crudely coloured Christ.  On one altar there has great knife gushes about its keyhole.  The windows of stained glass are fantastick traceries of colour and open spaces, and still is the litter of the old piece over the rough floor tiling.</p>
<p>This afternoon Basil B. and self climbed the bell tower, one corner has fallen to a shell, but the great bell's scaffolding is unbroken.  What a wounderful place to watch a night barrage bombarding from.</p>
<p>Poor churches of Belgium, crude designing and unlovely shrines for the terrible sacrifice of the Mass, but they are true entirely to their peasant worshippers, brilliantly coloured and devoid of any aesthetick beauties, still they remain a true impression of their dull faith.</p>

<p>Slept last night in Bailleul, in a quaint tiny room in a house of old woman, they invited us in and charmingly received us, and sent us off early to catch leave train with all wishes for "a good [indecipherable]".</p>
<p>209.<br/>Too good a night to miss its entry.  Yesterday at Kemmel a Boche over photographing for one of our planes &amp; suddenly 4 of ours started chasing him.  Jove it was a magnificent</p>
