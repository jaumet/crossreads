<p>Worgret Camp,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Australian Commonwealth Military Forces letterhead.<br/>Wareham, Dorset<br/>(England) 23rd Jany 1917</p>
<p>My dearest Daddy,<br/>Since I last wrote I have been shifted from Perham Downs Camp to the above Camp.  The second day I was at Perham Downs, I had to go out on two route marches &amp; in between these marches was put on to physical jerks.  The next morning I was so sore in my wound that I paraded sick.  It was scarcely to be wondered at as it was an unusual strain I was put to.  The next <strike>morning</strike> afternoon I was warned for a draft to leave at 5am the following morning for Wareham.  It hit me pretty hard to have to get up at &frac12; past 4 with the ground covered with frost &amp; snow.  Although only 60 miles from Perham, we didn't arrive here till 4 in the afternoon.  However we got here &amp; that is the main thing.  I was very thankful to get away from the Camp at Perham Downs; it was a Camp right in the middle of the Downs which for weeks on end were covered with snow &amp; frost.  This isn't all; the wind sailing across the Downs is like a sharp knife cutting right into the bone.  Here we are sheltered to a great extent by ridges &amp; mountains  The Camp itself is in a good possy; about 25 men to a hut, 4 blankets &amp; a straw palias per man.  Each hut is lit with electricity, &amp; <strike>qu</strike> just across the road hot &amp; cold baths up till 8 P.M.  The tucker isn't too bad considering, &amp; altogether I am pretty comfortable.</p>
