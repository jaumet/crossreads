<p>amongst shell holes &amp; along smashed up rail embankments &amp; under shell fire for about 2 miles but there were no casualties.<br/>12/10/17 Just a year today since went into camp at Dubbo. Marched all night with very few spells so all hands were very fatigued. Arrived front line 5.15am &amp; 5.25 barrage started &amp; we hopped over. Ground was very muddy &amp; shell holes everywhere so that walking with our load was extremely difficult. Eventually arrived at 1st objective with very few casualties &amp; were there held up</p>
