Jock I packed up in a few secs, but we could not leave the dugout for old Fritz was shelling like old Harry it was dangerous to poke your head out, one shell caught a bunch of chaps just as they were opposite the dugout wounded every one of them, one chap had his leg hanging off as he hobbled down the stairs it was an awful sight but he was as cool as a cucumber, there were no stretcher bearers handy
