4/5/16.
Went to the "Bull Ring" and had instruction in grenades. Threw live Mills Hand Grenades and used rifle grenades. The hand grenades are peculiarly deadly; and it is a strange sensation to throw one for the first time. There was an accident with one today and the instructor and another was killed, and five were injured.

To the Etaples Steam Laundry for a bath, and to wash my clothes. A big Australian mail was distributed. A very popular day.
6/5/16. 
At the training ground today the company went through a sort of obstical race over high walls and trenches carring all our gear. Very strenuous.
