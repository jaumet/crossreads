This jewelled morning Headquarters moved to another war-worn chateau, of fine design, exquisitely placed among noble trees, close grouped and set out with a judgment well-informed by a sense of beauty. The village about it is pretty though neglected and decayed and being on high ground, from it one gets a good view of the fair, surrounding country though towards "the line" the terrain is cut up.
