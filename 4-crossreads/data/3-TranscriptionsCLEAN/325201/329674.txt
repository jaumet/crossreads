  
 Brigade now, springing from God knows where, of our going up to Khartoum. It would be very nice next winter, but just now I have no desire to go 2000 miles nearer the Equator.  Anyway it is all rot. They want all the troops they can get here.  As I commenced the day today at 2.30 am I think bed would be an excellent idea now.
