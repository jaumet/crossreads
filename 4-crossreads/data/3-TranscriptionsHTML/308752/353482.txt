<p>Part IX<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    23rd. August, 1917, 8th. November, 1917.<br/>Return to France:  In the Line:  Awarded Military Medal.</p>
<p>I think it would be most appropriate to continue on with my Diary &amp; end the report on the above date, as today is the second anniversary of our departure from sunny N.S.W. That eventful &amp; somewhat sad morning, when we bid farewell on board the Beltana, is ever fresh n my memory. Little did I think then, of what lay before us, the past 24 months seem like a dream at times, &amp; they are indeed very memorable months. Our experiences have been of a very varied character, pleasant &amp; unpleasant (dark days &amp; stirring days) exciting &amp; unexciting. We have travelled many thousands of miles, &amp; my views of the outside world have been considerably broadened &amp; combined with the knowledge gained of conditions prevailing in the countries visited during the past two years has been the best education I have had. Five countries we have visited, Egypt, France, Belgium, England &amp; Scotland, &amp; from all appearances we should visit a few more before returning to Australia. Honestly speaking, I am not keen on travelling to other foreign lands, what we all want is to return to Australia, absolutely the best spot on this earth. In our travels quite a number of nationalities, we have come across, English, Irish, &amp; Scotch troops, Egyptians, Arabs, French, Belgiums, Portusese, Indians West Africans, Americans, Chinese &amp; Germans. A fair collection some of the habits &amp; customs of the above are very peculiar &amp; interesting &ndash; especially the Egyptians &amp; Chinese.  We must certainly admit that German is a wonderful nation,  she is practically fighting the world.</p>
<p>This part is sure to upset you but why worry, I cam through alright &amp; am O.K. at present. I think it best to tell of our experience, it is no use "beating about the bush".  Now please do not think that I send these different parts</p>
