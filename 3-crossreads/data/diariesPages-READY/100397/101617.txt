I dont know yet. Coming over we had various experiences, first a Route march at night to get to the Rly Stn. then we waited there at the Church Army Hut all night, for a Train. The train left next day about 11 am. and did not arrive at destination till after 6 p.m. then we waited for a boat till, 3 P.M. next day and landed in Blighty about 6.30 pm. Trained for London and eventually reached there about 10 P.M. straight to Horseferry. handed in our Kits, then drew clean clothes had a hot bath, and then went hunting for a bed, which we eventually secured at the Church Army Hostel, not far from Horseferry  next day we had to straighten up things a little, and then I proceeded to Surrey. and here I am. I shall write more anon. but just at present it is close to Dinner time and if I started a long letter I would not be able to finish it. Mothers letter telling me that she was sending money came the night I left the Bn. I had all my things ready to go when the letters were brought along. strange wasn't it?. now I will Ring off with Love to all and especially Yourself and Mother
