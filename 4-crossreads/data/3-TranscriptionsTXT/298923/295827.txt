 10 June 1918 Monday Our horses are back 3 miles, 1 man to 4, &amp; we won't see them again for some weeks All day shells go over from us &amp; for us, but we are well dug in    Australasians of March 16 arrived today!!!  Doubtful if I get the Pastorals Times you mention posting- No word of Western Battle front reaches us- but I see the results make no difference to Numbers of recruits in Australia. Am busy digging "posies" &amp; making range charts etc:-  but we take off our Hats to the Infantry in France.
