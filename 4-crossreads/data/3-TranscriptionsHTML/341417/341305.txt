<p>Hospital in,<br/>England.<br/>13/5/18.</p>
<p>Dear Brother Arch.</p>
<p>I suppose you think I am dead not writing to you and letting you know how I got hit.</p>
<p>Well, 11.45 P.M. May 5th we were waiting for our Barrage to stop and when it stopped my officer said "go" and we went and some stayed there hit, mostly killed, for a moment I thought it was the prettiest sight I ever saw bursting shells, high and low, explosions and machine guns going then a star shell which lit the whole affair up. However I only got a few yards when a shell burst five yards behind us I would taste its strong fumes the next thing I remembered was that I was on the ground dident know whether I was hit or not, then the officer sang out for the seargant to take charge and at the same time fell alongside of me holding the back of his head with both hands.</p>
