My dear father
The parcels came to hand safely I got them to day, I expect you all had a hand in the watch, thanks very much, it will be very handy. also please thank mother for sox they are the real thing at last should stand any amount of marching. not that we do much here, things are rather slack, owing to riots in Melbourne. our weekly leave has been cut down 6 hours, giving us only 6 hours to enjoy ourselves in this act has cause quite a stir of indignation in the camp but its no use the lads kicking as the order came from the C.C. a very high authority on such matters. The rein for the 13th Batt which recently arrived from Liverpool are out on strike. some mistake occurred, their pay is now 10 days overdue. I can't blame them for feeling narked. no money, tobacco or cigarettes, the very last straw as far as soldiering is concerned.
We had a sort of sham fight this morning which I think was a farce, we had a good time enjoyed the change from the parade ground to the paddocks but learnt nothing did very little. I hope things will be different when we arrive in Egypt or where ever we are going, otherwise we will get wiped out in
