Calais, Boulogne, Etaples
11/7/16
 The surrounding country is wind swept and a salt tang is in the air. We skirted the town which is a large place. A peculiarly shaped spire caught the eye. It was foursided and appeared to rest on a squat base. The line swings round with just an occasional glimpse of the Channel passing through open farm land. From one spot a very fine view of the whole country including Calais is obtained. The roads are white chalk and later we passed big quarries.

Here a lovely region commences the trees are thick and line the banks opening now and then to disclose some neat chateau. At Abbeville we only spent a few minutes and then continued along the basin of the Somme to Amiens. The country round here must be some of the pick of France. We passed through the city and went right out to a siding at Longerau where we detrained. Some of the land is very marshy but intensely cultivated like market gardens most of the work being done by women.

They could easily have dropped us there but advanced as a reason that there were no facilities for unloading the
