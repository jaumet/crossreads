<p>25.6.15<br/>Fri. 25th.  One of the boys on the beach was riddled with shrapnel this morning but the Drs. say none of the bullets struck a vital part &amp; he will live, another shell exploded as it hit a stack of cases containing cigarettes, tobacco, etc. &amp; I believe it lifted cases &amp; tobacco &amp; cigarettes into the sea wholesale, swimming was barred for a couple of hours in consequence.  I believe there were several lads hit, some say 15 were struck by one shell.  On the 'phone again at midday.  I have had a head-ache all day &amp; am not feeling to bright on it.  At 4 o'clock this afternoon the Lord Nelson came up opposite us escorted by 5 torpedo boats, &amp; fired 40 or 50 shots from her guns (heavy) she had a high elevation on her guns, so was probably firing at something across the Peninsular.  The Turks had the hide to try &amp; drive her away with shrapnel.  Just before</p>
