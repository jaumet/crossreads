29/5/18  Franvillers
A dull day at first but afterwards it cleared and became one of remarkably clear visibility.   Shells commenced early coming from the directions of Marett Wood and some landed unpleasantly close.   One dudded in the back yard and shook this house to its very foundations.   The official photographer appeared early on the scene and took some groups.   He remained with us all day.   After lunch I inspected the Transport at their lines and had a good turnout.   There was little to find fault with in the appearance of the men as they were well and neatly turned out.   Had a look in at the Q.M.'s store.   The old trouble of lack of material for Australian hats & tunics has again cropped up.   The Hun sent a plane over late in the afternoon and he flew very low.   Our machine guns etc. did not do much execution against him.   The afternoon was sunny with a few clouds and a light cool breeze - just the conditions under which observation is best here.   Villers Brettoneux stood out very clearly on the top of the ridge to our right and something was on fire just behind it.   At Marett Wood we could see the Bn H.Q. and all the Boche trenches etc. on the next ridge.   In the evening shifted out into the trenches where the Pioneers had dug a fine place for me.   As long as the weather keeps good it will be alright.   The front was a mass of red cored balls of fire tonight for the guns are active.   Groping fingers of searchlight spring out from Amiens way.
