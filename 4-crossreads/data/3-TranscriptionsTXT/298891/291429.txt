12 Wednesday
Mild drizzle. Went to Vodena with Sisters D. & Urquhart. Had tea with Dr Petrovietch. Got home about 8.30. Travelled back with Serb. Capt. Just back from Russia via Archangel & Liverpool & Winchester. Very tired of the war in all its aspects. Leaves still on the big plane tree in Vodena main street.
