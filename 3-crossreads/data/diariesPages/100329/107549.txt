London Official 13/10/15 – Bulgaria has declared war on Servia & invaded her on several portions of her eastern frontier. Germans also pressing her in the north.

Meanwhile Greece remains in her "armed" & "benevolent" state of neutrality. The Germans have fiercely counter-attacked in France & beyond a few minor successes have been repulsed all along the line.

A very quiet day locally - one of our aeroplanes was brought down by enemy’s guns yesterday afternoon. The pilot however was able to valplane to within our lines. He landed near the salt lake, Suvla, & was subjected to heavy machine gun & shrapnel fire.
