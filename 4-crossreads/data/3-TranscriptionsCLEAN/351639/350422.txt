Cable six section three  stop   this ten days interval was of course made full use of by the enemy who now knowing definitely where our main blow would fall was able to released his divisions in the north stationed round Bulair and bring some of them to the threatened point stop  all hope of effecting a surprise had now vanished and it was obvious that if the position was comprised within the sector stretching from Hill seventy to hill 112 the line chosen for our assault could only be taken by a frontal attack and sheer hard fighting stop   meanwhile the Turks ah made full use of the time afforded them
