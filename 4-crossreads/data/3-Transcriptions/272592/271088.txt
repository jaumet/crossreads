<p>our Hqr's the dugouts here are built under the railway line &amp; are not much good for they are so crowded I had charge of a party of 18 men to night &amp; had to take them to an altogether new position, so the Captain called me in to his dugout &amp; showed me the map of the sector, it was a fair way off &amp; behind "Zillebeke" up towards the 2nd Bn. the name of the joint was Rudkin House but save the mark there's not 2 bricks left standing.</p>
<p>On the way up I was not quite sure of the way so I called in to the 2nd Bn Hqrs to enquire, I was shown in to where the officers were having their mess, &amp; the Colonel told me I was on the right track</p>
