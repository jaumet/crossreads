The truth seems to entertain them sufficiently. Formed a party and drove around then went to the Theatre, "Airs & Graces". Today, went to  Manchester Street and took one of the girls to church. A Service conducted in St Pauls Cathedral by the Bishop of London. The singing of the choir was anglic. Saw numerous Lords, etc; in their pews. The church itself is a very grand piece of work. Inspected Holman Hunts picture. "The Light of the World". Shifted my diggings to Manchester Square near Baker Street. Haven't stopped at the same place twice so far. I can get about in this city good oh now, but I would have to be here a couple of years before I could see half of it.20/8/17 Went to Hampton Court with a girl friend from Manchester Street. A charming place. Returned by way of a boat on the River Thames. The most beautiful trip
