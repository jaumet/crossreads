  
 The show as a splendid one & the theatre was packed. My room at the hotel was a very comfortable one, nothing like having the very best after living under the ground over in France. 
 Monday the 19th. inst was a very busy day for me, I did a number of important commissions for some of my pals over yonder, purchased a number of gifts which I sent home, & called on Mr Hooper, of Hooper & Harrison.   I spent an hour at his office, & we had a good old yarn.  In the afternoon I do some more shopping, as the bus strike was on, I often travelled by the Tube Railway.  This unfortunately was bad for me, as I got lost travelling about in this manner so had to have a taxi. During the afternoon I called on a friend of one of the chaps in the Ambulance, & we had tea together, & then went to Chu Chin Chow in the evening. I liked this wonderful play, better than last year, the music in it is beautiful, & the staging magnificent. This play has had a wonderful run, over two years.  Oscar Asche & Lilly Brayton, take the leading roles in it. The score of Chu Chin Chow was sent home, that famous Cobblers Song is included in it. 
 One would never think, on seeing London, that there was a War on, the whole place is one wild rush & excitement.  Jolly good thing to see the place like this, a sure sign that we are winning.
