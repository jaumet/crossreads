<p>18/9/16.<br/>Last night Hack called &amp; we went for a ride into Poperinge about 3 miles away. It is a fine large place &amp; shows <strike>plenty</strike> signs of street fighting &amp; bombardment. It was alive with soldiers but very few civilians. We were on bikes so had to watch them very carefully this is a great place for bike thieves. Bought a Belgian Hand made lace H'chief &amp; had a long yarn to the shop keepers, two charming Belgian lassies.</p>
