<p>part of N.S.W. as I did, she has travelled a good deal.<br/>29th. "Guest night" &amp; a big dinner with all the pomp &amp; ceremony of military dinners, we all drank the Kings health when the President proposed it, plenty of wine nuts etc. My boil still very sore this morning &amp; I had to go down, the nurses fixed it up by pressing nearly all the black blood out of it, &amp; this afternoon it feels much easier it wants to for I got no sleep last night, it was very painful, I have to go down to the hospital 3 times daily until further notice, the Dr. said it was a very nasty boil &amp; in a bad place, close to the nerves. Rained heavily all night &amp; today it is cold &amp; bleak</p>
