<p>Well, it is supper time now &amp; then I'll have to be off to bed.  We are only allowed until 10 p.m. in this Hospital.  It is too cold to wash in the mornings now &amp; use cold water so we have to find hot water somewhere in the place.  We are both well &amp; Hoping to be on the way Home in less than 6 months.</p>
<p>Love to you all<br/>From Harry</p>
<p>P.S.  Could you manage to send a few small Circular Head Potatoes home to Uncle Tom, just to see if they will grow on the Isle of Man.</p>
