<p>[Thursday 16 November 1916]</p>
<p><strike>Goodbye to the great grey frowning turretted &amp; crenellated fortress rock.</strike>  As the tugs whistled the echos sounded for minutes after &amp; the French blue jackets stood at the salute - &amp; cheered -  The Officers of the French submarine were most kind in showing me all over their boats &amp; we drank "vive la France" &amp; entente cordiale in French vermouth-<br/>I would like to describe the submarine but must not do so.<br/>Beautifully calm &amp; sea a lovely blue-  We are again dressed up in our Lifebelts- <strike>but one of H. M. Navy Torpedoe Boat Destroyers is acting as escort (so we are not worrying)</strike></p>
