<p>Tuesday, 7.<br/>Jerks morning. Received word to pack up and be ready to leave any hour. Lesson evening in French at Berlitz School. They refunded 30 piastres each. Wired 6pm Sister M. Wrote Mother and S.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 8.<br/>Orders issued at 6.30am that all kits to be packed and tents struck by 7.30am. Everything ready, but authorities kept us fiddling round until 11.30 am. Then we moved off to Zeitoun and entrained in open trucks---12.30.</p>
<p>On parade, W. shows himself in true colours---grasping, with a narrow, crabbed egotism, not the pride of individuality that lifts itself high, in spite of the encroachments of collective circumstance, but egotism that is indifferent to all else, and blind.</p>
<p>Arrived at Tel-el-Kebir (dinner, bully beef, in train) about 4pm. Marched two miles and found we had been sent to the wrong place. We were given "sit easy" for two and a half hours. (No tea except what we could forage). Marched off again to thatched huts---no blankets. This, our first taste of actual Active Service conditions of course evoked the saying "This is the life!"</p>
<p>Thursday, 9.<br/>After a bitterly cold night we fell in for breakfast---bully beef and biscuits. Went over to the scene of the old battle of 1882. Saw Arabic Pasha's trenches.</p>
<p>After fiddling round all morning all except 3rd. of 4th. left Tel-el-Kebir in trucks for Ismailia. No dinner ration issued. Arrived about 2pm. Picked for Sergeant of Baggage Fatigue. Our camp a couple of miles away---heavy sand. Col. C. asked me previous profession. Told him. He said, "Good, very good. We've only had one so far". Attached as Sergeant to 21st Battery. We did nothing beyond watering and feeding horses. B. and number of others</p>
