<p>Friday 8 June 1917</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]  Laura writes that she has seen my Father in Law's death in the Paper at home &ndash; I have had no Cable so am not worrying too much yet it may be another man &ndash; Dolly will feel it. Visited 3rd L.H. &amp; took them down at Bridge last night.</p>
<p>Tomorrow a French Cavalry General is to witness the L.H. take a Redoubt &ndash; Nowell's Camels will be on our left, a sort of Field Day showing L.H. doing dismounted duty like Rafa, MAGDHABA over again, but this time no real enemy.</p>
<p>Got some splendid shirts for the men from the L.H. Depot Sydney &ndash; most acceptable as the warm weather is here now.</p>
