 Just a line to say I am in excellent health. Landed in Marseilles on 4 april, spent two days & nights in a troop train & am now here on the Sea Coast. censorship is strict so no towns are mentioned. I have plenty to do & see many Australians, Mr Hingst's son, Young Ford of Wickham, Lt Morton (Dalgety & Co) & other N/cle people here. Vaughan has charge of our 2nd Division Camp - The Country is so pretty now, Trees in green leaf. The Cuckoo & sometimes the Nightingale are heard. I wrote Grace fully so no doubt you hear some of my news at times. no one knows when the war will cease. I hope all of us here will see it through. Best wishes to the Dr & yourself also your niece if she is with you G R Short
