<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother<br/>A day of great excitement. Have at last started on the long trip home. It makes me feel pretty sentimental. Many a time have I little expected to start for home.</p>
<p>Left the School at 1 o'clock &amp; train started at 3.30. Shall be at Havre France for about 5 days &amp; then go to England. Got two letters from you today.</p>
<p>The train is shaking too much to write</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Your afft Son<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
