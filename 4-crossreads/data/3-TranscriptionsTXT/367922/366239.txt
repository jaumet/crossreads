(See over)In the fieldFrance 2/7/17
Dear Eric,Just a line to let you know that I got fed up with the General Hospital and have exchanged with a Field Ambulance Sergeant? My address now is:- Staff Sergt. B. Rainsford, 14th Australian Field Ambulance, A.I.F. France.
The papers have been arriving regularly. I got the last batch of about 20 about three weeks ago.
At present our Division is resting and we are in billets in rather a decent little village. The country is looking very pretty now, i.e. the part that hasn't been shelled lately. Smiling France is coming into its own.
Sincere yoursBruce RainsfordP.T.O.
