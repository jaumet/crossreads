<p>with one triangular sail, there is one mast to the top of which is attached a long cross beam which holds the sail.  When the sail is furled this cross beam is brought vertically with the mast &amp; the top end came easilly up to the promenade deck. Some of the boys, fastened this beam to the ship, by means of a rope. When the dhow tried to move off they found that they could not, so then there was a hubbub, <strike>the bo</strike> asked to have it undone, but the boys demanded bucksheesh first, it was sore against the Gypo's grain, but they sent up oranges &amp; cigarettes, but the boys could not give up so good a joke so soon, a native police boat came on the scene, but that made no difference. However they were finally let go, but not untill some one had turned a hose on to them, which I think carried the joke too far, as it did damage to their goods. We are now going down the Red Sea. While at Port Said we saw the masts &amp; funnels of ships that had been sunk, sticking up out of the water.</p>
