<p>Moving again. It seems recently we have wandered all over Palestine &amp; I feel I could sleep for a week. Our way from Ramleh lay along a good road through very pretty country. The green orchards &amp; red tiled houses was a revelation to us after such a spell in the desert. It reminded me very much of the Northern line of N.S.W. Before reaching Jaffa we rode right into a scrap at Dieran and did some first aid among the Boys. We entered Jaffa about four in the afternoon with the New Zealanders. Our small section had the honour of being the first Ausys to enter Jaffa. Turks hidden in the houses of Jaffa &amp; the boys busy rooting them out</p>
