  
 Monday 2 September 1917 [1918] Cairo 4.30 p.m. & took Laury & Laddie Lawton to tea at Empire Club, bout Pt. 30 for cakes, sandwiches, etc., Groppis - very enjoyable little tea party under the old trees, then Laury & I shop, brush for Mr. Lane, "the improved Englishman" as he says (brush Pt. 44) then back to 31st & Heliopolis per motor - lovely evening light & if only the hosp. were at peace, but never while this woman reigns I fear.  Pt. Lane after haem. from bowel (about [indecipherable]) is going on well & malarias haem. from liver, bowel etc., it would seem, but too much like enteric stool for my fancy.
