 Finish the work at 11 a.m The mate personally thanked us for our trouble. We get 2 or 3 bottles of whiskey for the men from the officers. We get a sight of the south coast of Java about 2 pm 
 1915 March 3 Wednesday 
 Continue along the Java coast all day. Surprised at the height of some mountains which seem to rise sheer up from the water Much hotter the wind having dropped to a light breeze.
