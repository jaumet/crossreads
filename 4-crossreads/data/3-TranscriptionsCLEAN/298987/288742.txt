shrapnel & H E in & about our camp. Our humpie rocked a good deal one piece of stuff hit the roof but did not come through & Pross who is an old hand decided it was better to clear out so we hopped out of bed & started down the road. Bill & Thompson got mixed up on some shell holes as it was very dark & went back but Pross & I got into a dug out about 30 ft deep we know of about 200 yds away a wretched wet shop it was allthough a few men are kept there allways pumping it out Most of the show was over by the time we got there so it was not long before we back in our dry beds again. No one was hurt allthough  some had narrow escapes. Have heard since it was a Hun raid & we captured the prisoners as our barage stopped them getting back to there lines
Saturday 2ndWent out to the job about 9 & got some stuff together a cold windy day with a little snow
