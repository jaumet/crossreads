Today we commence the fourth year of service overseas. Marched out the Battalion to the high ground behind the village. D Coy was late on parade and I don't think Patterson will forget in a hurry the chillingly sarcastic and polite address he received when his company did march on. Had to stop Smith firing his Lewis Guns because of the bullets going over the stop butt. Groves took his bombers away and used them for life bombing. Others carried on with a syllabus. While we lunched the Band played. The full high green grass and meadow flowers smelt very sweet as we sat on them and ate our lunch. After lunch we received orders to send up advance parties as our relief of the front line is to take place tomorrow night. Carried out the company in attack and had the four o0perating in different directions. Then flagged out a J.O.T. and did the Batt n in attack on a frontage of about 600?. The usual perpetual faults came to light in the advance ? bunching, loss of direction etc. We had flag signallers to represent the barrage. Fixed up a small upright post on our limbers for the purpose of using Lewis Guns for anti-aircraft work. The companies marched back to the village headed by the Band and then dismissed
