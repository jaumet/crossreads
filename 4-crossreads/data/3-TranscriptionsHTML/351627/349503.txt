<p>Palestine<br/>31st May 1917</p>
<p>My dear Aunty<br/>I received your letter of March 18th &amp; was very pleased to hear from you.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Frank a week or two ago &amp; he was quite well at time of writing, he also said that the weather had begun to improve &amp; that where he is now there is not so much mud.</p>
<p>We are experiencing very decent weather here, not nearly so hot as "the Sinai Sands". At present we are camped near the beach, we were sent here for a rest, we have only been here a day or two &amp; have no idea how long we are likely to stay</p>
<p>June 4<br/>I believe there is some prospect of us getting two or three days leave. It is about seven months since we had our last leave to Port Said &amp; Alexandria, so they ought to be able to spare us a few days each.</p>
<p>Things have been quiet here lately there is practically "nothing doing"</p>
