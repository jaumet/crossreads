<p>My dearest Mother   &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>Am delighted to say a nice mail arrived from Australia about 2 days after I last wrote. One from Alice dated 11th Feb   &amp;  Ethel's with dear old Mothers dated Feb 25th.</p>
<p>The socks arrived to-day   &amp;  yesterday a nice little New Year Gift from Annie Roddick. A Diary   &amp;  Calander  so you see my old friends are still thinking of me.<br/>&nbsp;I was so pleased to know that you are all well   &amp;  seems to  be getting along all right.</p>
<p>Very pleased to hear that Elsie Gourlie is so happy, hope she has got the right man this time.</p>
<p>Have not heard from Charlie since I returned, suppose the poor kid is in France by now, hope he will be kept out of the firing-line for a time. It is awful to see the wounded here, we are very close so get the very bad cases. I'm afraid I shall soon be leaving here,  have done 6 months now so may</p>
