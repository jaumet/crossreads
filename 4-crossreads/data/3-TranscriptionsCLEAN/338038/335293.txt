Havre7.1.17My dear Father & Mother,
Your more than welcome letters of 12th & 14th Novr reached me the day before I left Exeter to return to camp at Salisbury - You will have heard from Sis that I was suddenly sent for to return to France, consequently the last few days were very broken up. I left Southampton on the 1st inst. and have been hung up here ever since but am probably going on up country tomorrow or next day.
I had a splendid time taken altogether while in England, but was never quite able to shake of a cold, which has fortunately now disappeared. Probably the sea air of Havre has done the trick.
