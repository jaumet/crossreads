1/9/15 Dr Maplestone a good trencherman. Rather interesting to watch his development. We expect to make Lemnos tomorrow morning but the Master expects to lay off a couple of days.
10pm. Darkness everywhere on deck all saloon windows are covered with thick blankets. Still passing among islands had a good blow on saloon deck and so to bed
2/9/15 Up and had a bath ? "very goood very nices very klean". Fresh sea wet decks, no land about, issuing ammunition iron rations The men quite amusing in their excitement earnestness. "How much do we get, where do we put it", and so on. Each man as he gets his allowance getting away into a corner by himself like a dog with a bone stowing it away in his cartridge pouchs. Lemnos in sight a long rugged barren looking island the sea in between - shining in the sun covered with white cliffs. Coming into harbour swing round large cape, score of big transports warships in sight ? a beautiful place 3 hospital ships big camps beyond. Glorious blue sky sea. Embarkation officer just aboard HM Southland. 63 off. 1362 men (Bde Div 21st Co 23rd ) sunk by submarine just behind us. Much afraid Jack on board her
