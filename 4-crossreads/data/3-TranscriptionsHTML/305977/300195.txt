<p>couldn't get away as all town leave was stopped owing to the big row the previous day.</p>
<p>Sunday 4th<br/>There was a combined Protestant Church parade in the cinema tent in the morning.  Segt Major Knowles sang a couple of solos.  Nothing doing in the afternoon.  No leave granted.</p>
<p>Monday 5th<br/>A very windy dusty day.  Was on pumping fatigue with 2 men from each squadron.  We paid a couple of niggers a few piastres to do the work, &amp; did nothing ourselves.  The 2nd &amp; 3rd Reinforcements to this Regt arrived in camp today.  There were nearly 100 of them.  Wrote a letter to Doug.</p>
<p>Tuesday 6th<br/>B Squadron went out on patrol duty.  2 troops did the scouting going out &amp; the other 2 coming back.</p>
