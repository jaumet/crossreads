March 191718th.   This morning the whole section was taken off their old work, &amp; with our infantry party, we were put onto making a rough roadway to bring the remainder of the guns up, &amp; for "limber" &amp; wagons traffic.This morning I went over to Les Boeufs &amp; on to Le Transloy &amp; the Sugar Mat to within a few hundred yards of Beulencourt.   The latter of these places a few days ago was well behind Fritz's lines.   The country is broken up a lot &amp; in Le Transloy there are signs of many attempts by Fritz to burn the place down.There is a rumour at large that we are going to move forward any minute &amp; that we are awaiting orders.
