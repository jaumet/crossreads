Mail came in. Got letters from Lill, France, Mother and Ernest. Also 2 photos. from Lill and papers form France. On 9 o'clock parade we got orders to pack up and be ready to move off to Estaires early in the morning. Then the Col. sung out "Thomas William Howard" and Bricky stepped out (as usual borrowing some one elses hat) The Col. then read out that Bricky had been awarded the Military Medal, shook hands with him and called for 3 cheers, which were given very heartily, as Bricky is very popular with the crowd. I also wrote a long letter to Lill.
Monday 14th
Reveille at 5 Breakfast at 6. Blankets and packs carried on the waggons for once. We left our "aromatic" farm about 2 in parties of 20. Marched along to Estaires in easy stages. Pulled up outside a church and waited to see the King and Gen. Haig go by. 
All sorts of "Furfees" are flying around. The best one is that "the King reviewed the Anzacs on the Somme and told them that in 26 hours they would hear news that would startle ?em, and we are all wondering what the dickens it can be. We were all sitting around smoking and yarning when I saw a party of officers, some distance away, stand to attention. The next minute a motor car dashed by with the Royal Standard flying, and I caught a glimpse of grey beard, which was all I saw of His most 
Gracious Majesty. After this excitement had subsided we "fell in" again and marched about another mile through the town to a big 3 storey building where we are billeted. It used to be a girls school, a few kiddies are still taught here, but the greater part of the building are taken upby the Military.
