 1916   WEDNESDAY 6   SEPT. 
 A fine warm day, the first for some time. Out with the signalling class all the day. We were paid 30/- in the afternoon. I went up in afternoon to the football ground in afternoon & marked a lot of it out. Went over to the YMCA concert in the evening & it was very good. There was a Bristol troup over for the evening. Got the duplicate letter from Linda.
