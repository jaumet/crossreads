preparatory to an attack. They fired mostly Shrapnel it was very uncanny to hear the low moans of the shells as they hurtled through the air to burst with a loud report when they struck. One could not tell which way they were coming it is this uncertainty that gives one many anxious moments.At about midnight they launched a gas attack which was in-affective then attacked with Infantry. They were repulsed by our chaps with fairly heavy losses, but we had a few casualties ourselves.The Machine Gun Rifle fire was very acute, whilst above this noise one could plainly discern the sharp report of Bombs hand grenades as they were thrown.Very cheering news has come to hand from the Russian Front wonderful enthusiasm is rampant among all our troops.I have just finished a big wash my wrists are fairly aching. Aeroplanes still active so am expecting a heavy go tonight with the Artillery.Our 4th Div Artillery are supposed to have made a very regrettable mistake last night.I am trying to obtain leave to visit Estaires Baillieul both of which are of much interest, as they have been knocked about, but it is very hard to obtain a pass, owing to so many Spies being about on the same gag.
