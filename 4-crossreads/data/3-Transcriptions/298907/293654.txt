<p>9th. Have got a bit of spare time on my hands this morning so I will try &amp; give a description of how a man when wounded is conveyed from the battlefield to Blighty when lucky.</p>
<p>The first man we come  in contact with is the Battn or Coy. Stretcher bearer, who paints the wound with iodine &amp; dresses it with a shell dressing if it is a large wound, or with the mans own Field Dressing if a small one, the man is then helped or carried to the Reg. Aid Post, here the man is again dressed by the M.O. &amp; a morphia injection is given in exceptional cases when a mark is made on the patient's forehead</p>
