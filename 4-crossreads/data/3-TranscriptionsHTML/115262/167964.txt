<p>Monday 16 July 1917.</p>
<p>Still feeling crook but went on the riding test and mounted drill. At the remount depot we saw some beautiful exhibitions of buckjumping.</p>
<p>Weighed myself on QM&#39;s scales at R. Depot and was 9 st. 12 lbs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have dropped weight owing to being crook the last fortnight.</p>
<p>&quot;Gaggat &amp; the Boy&quot; released from close custody&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who wanted leave there was leave given for 3 hrs to go to Moascar. I never troubled it.</p>
<p>Posted up that those who were under open arrest have been released as it was a mistake that we got into Ismailia on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Met &quot;Sid Glover&quot; who is now in Details camp.</p>
<p>1 biplane wrecked at Aerodrome and pilot killed.</p>
