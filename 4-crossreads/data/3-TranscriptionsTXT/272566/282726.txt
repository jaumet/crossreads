 Sunday 9 December 
 Drizzling rain all day. Today happens to be Prust's turn for the Corps. run. Fortunately I was not required for any trips today other than the 5 p.m. Casualty wire which I took to 15th Bgde. Sigs. on foot. It is expected that we are to move on or about the 15th inst. for a month's spell near the sea coast.
