 no stunts, plenty of racket at times &amp; lots of illumination at night. 
 I haven't heard from Tan since I saw him last &amp; as I know the N.Z's have been  getting  having some hard goes, I am rather worried. 
 The two Macs are well so are Billy Balcombe &amp; Squiz.  Brolga Hill is going into the Flying Corps.  It will suit him.  I wouldn't fly with him he's such a hare brained mad old coot but a dear old stick.  I shall tell you lots of funny stories about him when I get back. 
 My two latest great pals are good fellows &amp; drop over to see me now &amp; then (I don't get out much).  You'd like them especially Jock Micklejohn, they are both young &amp; make me feel terribly old at times. 
 Well I must stop.  Fare-the-well.  My love to Graham, the Boss &amp; Mac.  I hope things are all right. 
 Yours to a cinder Wilkie
