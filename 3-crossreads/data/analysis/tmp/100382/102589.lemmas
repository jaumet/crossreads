 March 1916 their place in the harbour too . That even we had a concert on board was the first bit of enjoy we had had sinc leav Egypt it was a fine turn out . After the concert I was again told off for submarin guard the next morn I took my first post at 6 am . We left Toulon at 8 am set sail for Marseill which we reach about 2 pm . To look for the entranc to the harbour is a puzzl from the ocean for there is also a big brake water here too we were guid through this toward our wharf . It was then rain but the band struck up the Marseillais as we pass the wharf the cheer was deafen . When the boat was tie up to the wharf the gang way swung I was detail off to help unload our gear off the boat it was then that I first put my foot in Franc . Marseill Harbour is a fine big place there were dozen of boat of all size there the wharf are also fine with their big storag shed etc . We did not disembark till about half past nine that night then we were line up march in four to the Railway station which was about a quarter of an hour walk from the boat . On reach the station we had to sit down wait till the gear etc was put on the train first
