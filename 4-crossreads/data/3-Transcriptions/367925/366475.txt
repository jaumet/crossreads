<p>All day &amp; night. About 10am on Xmas day our financial resources were exhausted. An opportune arrival of a mate replenished it to the extent of a Quid. This soon went &amp; I suggested returning to camp. No fear Said the Dubbo man "Lets go &amp; have a feast first. Whose going to pay for it I asked. "Never mind he replied. Come along with me" I thought "his tick was good" Somewhere &amp; went along. Our party was five strong. We arrived at quite a pretentious looking hotel. Soon the Dago waiters were hobnobbing around us &amp; we were seated at a table. Dubbo was master of ceremonies&amp; directed things in grand style. About half a dozen glasses of lager beer was punished by Each of us in a very smart and soldierlike manner. Then we switched on to Sherry &amp; bitters to get ready for dinner. Nothing but chicken would appeal to our delicate appetites &amp; this we had roasted, boiled &amp; Curried. In the meantime I was beginning to wonder who was going to pay for it &amp; was almost inclined to believe the Dubbo Giant was a millionaire in disguise. Dinner was washed down with copious draughts of lager &amp; towards the End of it the Secret leaked out. The small man who sat opposite Dubbo was at a given signal to call him anything but a gentleman &amp; throw about half a spoon of beer in his face. Both were then to set to &amp; punch the air in the vicinity of Each others heads. The Lilliputian was to retreat hastily towards the door with the Dubbo after him &amp; we after Dubbo. Of course the waiters made themselves scarce &amp; our passage to the street was unobstructed. I could not run for laughing &amp; could not stop laughing either for about an hour. You people might think our conduct Shabby but if you Knew how they rooked us right &amp; left in Egypt you would congratulate us on getting some of our own back.</p>
