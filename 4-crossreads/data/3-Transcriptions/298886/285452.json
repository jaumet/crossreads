<p>11th <strike>Feb.</strike> March  Sat  1916.</p>
<p>Well now we start to chronicle another days proceedings which is rather awkward I am lying in bed on the hard ground with my head against the wall of a big cotton mill in a big Arab village on the banks of the Nile called RODA or RHODA. I don't know if it is spelt correctly but that's how its pronounced. Had a long march today &ndash; over 25 miles the transport horses were a bit done up hauling their heavy loads. The road was fairly good  The OMDAH of the village where we Camped last night came along the road with us he led the way (Omdah means mayor) he was riding a thoroughbred Arab Stallion and one of the Egyptian police officers who acted  as guide and interpreter rode a thoroughbred brown Arab Stallion, and thereby hangs a tale. At a halt for water along the road this morning these two by some mischance got close together both had the bits out of their mouths <strike>for</strike> to give them a better drink &ndash; Suddenly and without warning the brown stallion savagely attacked the black stallion and a free fight ensued  Such a mix up of heels and flying mud would be hard to describe</p>
