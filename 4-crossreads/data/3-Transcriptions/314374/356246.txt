<p>(62)<br/>The French people will not allow his body or that of his wife to be transferred to the Invalides to the empty tomb that was prepared to receive them.</p>
<p>The remainder of the building is principally a museum.  We saw the coffin (they removed his body from St Helena to Paris in &ndash; 19 years after his death) also his Will (which was in a glass case) an extract being:- "Je desire que mes cendres reposent sur les bords de la Seine au milieu de ce people francais que j'aitant aime" &ndash; also his general's hat and soldiers clothes.</p>
<p>We then visited the cyclorama and saw the famous war painting.  It was painted on 4,000 square feet of canvas and occupied the whole wall around the circular building, depicting the whole of the battlefields of the Allied armies.</p>
<p>In the evening went to a concert, which are held in Paris on Sundays the same as week nights.</p>
<p>Next morning we took train to Versailles.  One enters the Palace grounds by the spacious Cour Royale, lined with its majestic looking heroic equestrian bronze statues, fountains, &amp;c, &amp;c.  The furnishings and paintings of the interior one couldn't adequately describe.  We visited the Galerie des Glaces (Room of Mirrors) and this was of especial interest for here Wilhelm I was proclaimed German Emperor in 1870, and in it the Treaty of Peace between the Allies and Germany was signed on 28th June 1919.  Also saw all the interesting things connected with King Louis and Marie Antionette.  The Palace is indeed a marvel with its hundreds of magnificently furnished and decorated rooms, and the wonderful terraced grounds with artificial lakes, statues and fountains.</p>
<p>That evening a party of us went, accompanied by a guide, unofficially, and saw "Paris by night".</p>
<p>The next day with some American soldiers we went and saw the great Cathedral of Notre Dame, which is on an Island in the river Seine &ndash; several beautiful bridges spanning the Island to the mainland.  It is a wonderful building and being a Saints' Day, High Mass was being sung, and we saw the unusual but touching sight of the soldiers in the Chancel presenting arms to the Host, after the consecration.</p>
<p>After leaving Notre Dame we went through the city, passing the famous Rat Mort (Dead Rat) Caf&eacute; &ndash; then the great cemetery famous for the illustrious men whose remains are there, and also for the rich monuments and statuary it contains.</p>
<p>The various mill wheels here do not let us forget that we are in Montmartre, and we pass the Moulin de la Galette &ndash; a picturesque old place dating from the 12th Century.</p>
<p>We then ascend steep stone steps and emerge from a clump of mean looking houses and suddenly rises in front of us the mighty church that we have trudged to see &ndash; Sacre Coeur.  It is built of grey stone and white marble and is of Byzantine architecture, being surmounted by a huge white dome.  We go inside and drink in the beauty of its lofty marble arches and pillars.  This church was built after the Franco-Prussian War as a thank offering and in</p>
