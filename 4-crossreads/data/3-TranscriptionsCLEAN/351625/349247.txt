  
 I believe the Germans have been doing some pushing on the Somme & have taken some ground but I believe our side has got the best end of the stick having cut him up terribly but the news we get is very vague.  I have been getting plenty of letters from you the last two were written, one a Austinmere & the other just after you had got back.  About that money
