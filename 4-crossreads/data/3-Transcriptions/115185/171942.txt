<p>5 &ndash; things today and it doesn't look as if anything will be ready for patients for a month at least. There is a large clear space of desert between this house and the barracks &ndash; almost 300 yards I should think &ndash; in part of the barracks runs a railway line and all day and all night trains are being loaded with war gear &ndash; men mules &ndash; horses &ndash; ambulances etc etc &ndash; and sent away we know not where. There is a rumour we may never even begin work here but go on perhaps to France &ndash; but we know not anything. It's very depressing one cannot bear to think at all &ndash; but take each day as it comes. On Saturday afternoon I went to the 4th Light hose Camp to see some sports they had got up to interest the men. Patricia Blundell's brother is a private &ndash; but we missed him in the crowd and I saw no one I knew. So came away &ndash; and went into a large building where a tea room &amp; or our men has been fixed up</p>
