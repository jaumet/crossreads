<p>&amp; the hard frosty ground being excellent for walking.  The Mess had an orgie on for Sunday so we commandeered the Ambulance to take us over &amp; arrived about 3 pm.  To our surprise there was an Orchestra to amuse &amp; a whole lot of Girls in our mess.  It is a monthly occurrence by permission of the G.O.C.  I sat by the Piano &amp; watched the Gaiety which was so novel after the quiet place it used to be.  Dancing was the order after Tea &amp; I must confess that I was to blame for it for no-one else could play the piano &amp; I obliged.  It began to rain at 7.30 pm &amp; we did not look forward with pleasure to a 3 mile tramp over the slippery muddy Hills.  At 9.30 pm we again commandeered the ambulance &amp; went Home in grand style in about 20 minutes.  I have not mentioned work.  I had my full share of that.  The Camp I was in had just been re-opened &amp; there was nothing to work with, not even a bit of scrap paper to write a note on.  It was icy cold too &amp; no fires &amp; mud everywhere.  It was my intention to write to you on Monday &amp; Tuesday but I had to work late into the night &amp; on Tuesday especially as I had to pack up for Bulford.  On Wednesday morning I left at 9 am &amp; we took over Duties in our old Hospital.  Ellis taking His old position with myself as assistant.  The place has gone to ruin &amp; even now working day &amp; night we have not been able to get straight yet.  It has nearly broken our spirits after having straightened things out at Havre &amp; Park House to come here &amp; make another start &amp; for what benefit to be put on the indispensable list &amp; kept here for 12 or 18 months longer.  If I can see no early release coming along, I am going to let things go to blazes &amp; get sent Home like my predecessors.  On Friday night I turned into a spring-mattressed bed again the first for 3 months</p>
