  
 noticed a very fine Library - all the works were in French - Encyclopedias etc, all badly knocked about. Our Division and Amb are proud of the fact that they were the first to enter Bapaume & La Fransloy. Kept fairly busy - hardly any sleep for about 50 hours. 
 Tuesday  20/3/17 
 Very windy & cold - snowed a little, also a light rain fell. Dr. Hughes M.O. to the 59th Batt. Killed by shrapnel. He was a great favourite & a real white man. Our Division still out in skirmishing order - several sharp encounters with patrols of mostly snipers - a few wounded Fritzs came through. Light Horse & the Indians had isolated engagements with Uhlans. Got official news that the French on our right have made much progress also. Most of the wounded have only bullet wounds. 
 Wednesday  21/3/17 
 Raw sort of day - but fine. Division are out 8 miles from Bapaume at one point, the Boys rushed a village in daylight & got it, fairly large number of wounded coming thro - but Fritz got particular amusement.
