  
 Sunday 9 April 1916 A grey morning giving place to a beautiful day. A Church Parade had been arranged for, but word came that on a/c of the outbreak of mumps - of which 3 or 4 cases occurred in my company - the whole of us were placed in isolation & the Church Parade consequently was cut out. Before breakfast went for a smart walk with our Adjutant (Lt. Moy) & immensely enjoyed the typical rural scenes of Europe. On either side of the lane (which in places was hedged in) were the undulating fields either fallow or with cereal abt 8 in. high in which I noticed several pairs of quail & 1 or 2 hares. Farmers here & there were ploughing & altogether it was a very peaceful picture. Writing & attending to Co. matters during the day, a good deal of excitement being caused in the afternoon by the appearance of 3 French dirigibles abt. a mile away proceeding out to sea over Paris Plage.
