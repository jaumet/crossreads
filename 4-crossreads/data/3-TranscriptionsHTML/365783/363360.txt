At Aden we had one of the most glorious sunsets I have even seen.   On the opposite side of the bay from the town is another range of irregular &amp; rugged mountain peaks &amp; behind these the sun disappeared, the colour effect in the sky was a beautiful golden and against this was the sharply outlined deep purple shadow of the mountains.   Later the moon came up over the craggy hills at the back of the town &amp; made another beautiful picture, the lights of the town &amp; several powerful searchlights enhancing the general effect.<br/>We left Aden at midnight &ndash; we did not get ashore at all.<br/><u>Wednesday 7th January</u><br/>Many happy returns of the day to dear old Mother.   At 9 AM we were passing through the Straits of Bab el el Mandeb with Perim Island on our starboard side.

These were acting as patrols for this portion of the Red Sea.</p>
