ItalyOne of the two naval signalmen in my watch a young man of 20 years of age which was sent on board at Alexandria. It appears he was signalman on the cargo transport. 6 steamers formed the convoy from England to Alexandria. The escort being a sloop & 2 trawlers. When 60 miles off Alexandria June 9th Sunday at 10 pm one of their ships was torpedoed it being dark at the time. The Clan ______. The sloop remained behind to pick up survivors. The subs followed & at 10.30 pm the 2nd ship _____ was torpedoed. He being in the _____ she was torpedoed at 11 pm. 3 cargo transports sunk out of 6. He & another signal man were 4 hours floating in the water with their belts on no other means of support as there boats were smashed. About a 100 lives were lost from the 3 ships. He was eventually picked up by the sloop in a very exausted condition & sent to the hospital & at present none the worse of his experience although sad.We here on board maintain that trawlers are useless as escorts as they are too slow to deal with subs. But off course splendid for saving life as is a case after a transport is torpedoed & sinking.
