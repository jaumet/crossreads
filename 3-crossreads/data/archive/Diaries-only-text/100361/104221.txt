Tues Mar 26
Fierce fighting continues. The war news is very serious, but everyone seems confident.
Wed March 27th

Thurs 28
Bill Beards and the Cook went on Leave. Flanagan cooked the dinner and it went off fairly well. Very wild night.
The Battle is still raging in France, but our chaps are holding. Fritz back a bit now.
