table, sitting on a good apology for a chair & using a kerosene lamp. I've just finished a Peek Frean's biscuit, & am now smoking a Zenith cigarette. I've been very hard up for cigarettes, but my quartermaster sergeant being a non smoker handed me over some that were sent to him. He is a Canterbury University man. I've been back now for nearly eight weeks & I brought over 600 cigs with me, & yet for the last month, I haven't smoked more than 50, if that. Don't be afraid that I'll stunt my growth, because now that we are getting the COLD weather, I'm approaching my original weight every day. Don't start worrying about me, there is absolutely no danger of being run over by trams or anything like that here.
Your affectionate sonArthur
