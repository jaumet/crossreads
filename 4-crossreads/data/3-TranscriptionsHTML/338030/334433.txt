<p>On Friday, 30th, we left Ginchy and proceeded about 6 miles further up to the guns. We left with 6 mules and 2 horses in a wagon, and soon after starting we were going over a shell-hole when the king-pin of the wagon broke, causing the front wheels to leave the rear ones. We unloaded the wagon, and after a delay of 2 hours, whilst the blacksmith was making a new pin, we succeeded in fixing the wagon up again. Before going much further we got stuck in the mud and had to get the assistance of 2 more horses, making a total of 10 animals. The road was in a terrible state with mud and shell-holes and we got stuck again. To get out we got 6 more horses, making a total of 16, and with great difficulty, after unloading the wagon, succeeded in getting another start. The road was so bad, that out of 4 wagons that left, 2 capsized, 1 broke the pole, causing the front wheels to be pulled clear of the wagon, and our wagon broke down. The mules and horses came down several times in the mud and shell-holes, and we arrived at 4 p.m., doing 6 miles in 7 hours. Only 3 wagons succeeded in  reaching their destination that night.<br/>On Sunday, 1/4/17, we took 20 horses to drag the remaining wagon out of the mud. While we were away, a taube brought down an observation balloon, about a hundred yards away, in flames. The two observers both landed safely in parachutes.<br/>On Monday, 2/4/17, a Taube came over several times, but was driven away by our guns. Twice while we were on parade,</p>
