<p>Sunday 28<br/>A carry last night brought us back along the Ypres to Zonnebeke road where we have been in a fine big pill box for the day. Shelling heavy. Very few casualties.</p>
<p>Monday 29 <br/>Still at R.H.Q. on Zonnebeke Road near Fryenberg. Very few cases are coming through though the shelling in the back areas is very heavy including many gas shells. One carry to the Canadian aid post was very warm. Fritz is getting on to our batteries after news of German offensive on Italy.</p>
<p>Tuesday 30<br/>Heavy gas attack last night by shelling. A carry through it and a fall into a shell hole were the nights episode.<br/>A Canadian attack this morning at about 6 am resulted in the Canadians obtaining all objectives in vicinity of Paschendale ridge. Relieved this afternoon by third F.A. &amp; come back to Lille Gate.</p>
<p>Wednesday 31<br/>Will's birthday. A beautiful day in Ypres at Lille Gate where things are very quiet. The Canadians still hang to the positions they took yesterday</p>
<p>November, 1917<br/>Thursday 1<br/>An ordinary day at Lille Gate.<br/>More disconcerting news from Italy</p>
<p>Friday 2<br/>A trip to Poperinghe for the day</p>
<p>Saturday 3<br/>Nothing at all to record.<br/>Tuesday 6<br/>A very hot carry down from Zonnebeke, perhaps hottest I have yet had. Caffin's squad had a patient killed on stretcher &amp; an accussation made by an officer at R.A.P. (Zonnebeke) is to be looked into.</p>
