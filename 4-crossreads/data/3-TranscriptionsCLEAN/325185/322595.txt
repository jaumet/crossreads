  
 for us now.  Am just killing time now.  I don't go ashore much.  There is nothing to go ashore for.  No where to go so one is better aboard.  I told you in my first letter I have signed on as storekeeper this time.  It is going to be a pretty heavy job but that is nothing.  I am not afraid of that. 
 There is only one thing I want & that is to get away from here.  It is definitely fixed we are going to England.  I suppose the troops will be kept there for awhile & trained I expect.  This boat will be sent across to the scene of war with other troops.  I am hoping so at any rate.  We had to sign here under Naval Articles so are classed as R.N.R's now.  Will be alright if we are drafted to one of the English Man 'o' wars won't it.  Will see some fun then if there is any going.  I would have liked to have been in New Guinea when they were taking it.  It is very amusing to read the papers here re the taking of "Samoa".  The N Zealanders take all the credit of the capture.  It was the Australian Fleet whom they surrendered to.  The N.Z troops landed after it was handed over.  The accounts of late are better than they were as regards the war aren't they.
