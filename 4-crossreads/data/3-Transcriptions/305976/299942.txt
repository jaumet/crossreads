<p>Saturday Nov 24<br/>Jaffa fine town &amp; the largest I have seen in Palestine. It has one main street. Large Town Hall, Gardens, Band Stand &amp; the outlying portions of Jaffa is very pretty.<br/> The Convent here is a very fine large airy building built of stone. The French civilian hospital is also a massive place. Germans principally occupied the best houses &amp; one on going into the Town can easily realise what a hold Turkish capital had here. We pitched our camp on some beautiful white sand situated handy to the Surf &amp; Town. Hope we have a decent spell here</p>
