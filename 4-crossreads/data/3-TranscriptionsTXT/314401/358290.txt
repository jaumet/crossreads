 The niggers are fallen in on the after part of the fo'c's'le deck, abaft the middle superstructure. They are short in stature but fairly intelligent looking. The guards bawl at them in English &amp; they make some shift to understand. Eventually they are sent below in the cable deck. For breakfast they had lime juice &amp; treacle &amp; bread.

The troops saluted, &amp; the flag was unfurled; our band played "God Save the King", then we gave three cheers &amp; sang the National Anthem.
