From your sentences I could not judge whether it was our own or the American government that had treated them shabbily.   Good night. Good night. Good night. [A line of Xs and Os.] Tabbie dear, good night. 
 6.8.15. 9.30 p.m. And Joseph dear, I find that one of your letters has been left unanswered.  It bears date 19.6.15.   A letter came from MacNamara in which he says that business matters are satisfactory at Coffs Harbour, that is good because in the course of a year he should be in a position to give you a few hundred pounds.   He said that Mrs M. and the family were well.   Good.   Tab has always a suitable answer ready.   Good Tabby. 
 Yes I remember Maney-Lake of the Hawkesbury College, I saw him at the college with you one evening. 
 Many Australians have been wounded, the stream continues to flow in, to night three train loads of wounded are to arrive in Cairo, and as far as we know the big fight has not yet begun, at the present rate of the casualties there will soon be none of the Australians left to do battle, but for those who return to the firing line there had been now great shortage of men It would be very strange if Sgt. Larkin were not dead, yet Dr. Arthur in one of his letters said that Larkin is expected home soon. 
 You are good to be knitting sox for me, thank you for doing so.  Holman and Hugh Ward. There cannot be two Hamlets in the one play.  The house giving is fashionable, not only in Australia but also in England.   Many thanks for the newspaper cuttings.   Good.   Good.   Good.  The map by Meyer has not yet come to hand, about the harbour bridge, I shall be interested with it, because for several years it has been before the public and is a matter that must some day be decided upon in the interests of the whole community-es. 
 How did the Earps come to be such friends of the Murrays?   They are not of the same class.  Mrs E will not care for New guinea, too much black and too little excitement. 
 Jerome informed me at tea to night that the butter was Australian, I hardly think that his statement was correct, perhaps it was, but it did no look to me or taste like the butter we had at home, and how could you people export the material when it is so expensive at home.   Pat Wat wrote to me and asked to be excused for the bad writing as she had not been to school for many weeks on account of the whooping cough. I shall send on a reply some day soon.  Meanwhile give to her and the other children my love, also best wishes to their Father and Mother. 
 This evening has come word that the Germans have taken Warsaw.   What think you of that
