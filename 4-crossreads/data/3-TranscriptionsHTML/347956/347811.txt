<p>the lads jumped over the side of the boat &amp; made themselves scarce, only two names out of eight were taken, one or two boat loads managed to get on board after 4 oclock, up a rope hung over the stern by a guard, there was no officers about so the guard helped them up; McGregor was the only signaller to get ashore but was caught on the way home.</p>
<p>The "fall in" went half an hour early this morning &amp; we were marched up on the boat-deck before the Colonel who said that a lot of men had broken ship &amp; that he would not allow any man leave in consequence &amp; that the innocent men had to suffer for the guilty.  I think the idea of the innocent suffering for the guilty rather appeals to him, but I am afraid that it does not appeal to the innocent very much.</p>
