Churches form prominent landmarks all over the town. 30th All efforts to refloat have failed & we are under orders to abandon ship.1st Dec Came off yesterday in nigger lighters, towed in strings of three. MGs last ashore. Were told that we must go into Barracks - marched , not to garrison, but through the town into the bush up a winding mountain road to the top of that same mountain I noted yesterday or earlier, Mt Aureol. A Jamacian (black) regiment is quartered here, 13 West I Regt. (a crack corps of regulars be it known) They made us very welcome, put their supplies at our disposal, quartered us in comfortable huts & generally were most hospitable. Fine men & first class Soldiers, these Jamaicans. They can give us points everywhere. The place is so rugged that the small square & the tennis court have been built up on the mountainside . The huts are ornamented by little rocky gardens
