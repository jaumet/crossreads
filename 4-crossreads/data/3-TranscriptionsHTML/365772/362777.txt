<p>London<br/>23.8.16<br/>My dear Sister,<br/>A month to-day since I was wounded, time does fly by, am up now kicking round, mostly in a wheel chair, but walk about a little also. Wounds are healing up nicely, no sight of septic whatever. I will be going gay round London in a week or so &amp; then back to the battalion.<br/>I suppose the casuality lists caused quite a stir in Australia, we were all mixed up in this last business &amp; suffered heavily also, it is a cruel thing this war I lost some very fine friends &amp; had a good platoon of men &amp; needless to say it was cut</p>
