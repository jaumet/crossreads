<p>we will be up about the front line somewhere.  I believe we are going to a quiet part.  We have been allotted to "C" Coy which at present is very much under strength as it got cut up a good deal last time they were in.  I am going to write to Aunt Greta &amp; get her to cable to let you know we are over here so you will hear long before you get this letter.  We missed getting into the 17th which we were trying to do &amp; which we should have been in</p>
