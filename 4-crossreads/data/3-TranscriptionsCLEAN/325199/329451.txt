  
 Thursday June 8. 1916. Rough sea today. Had a goood breakfast. Pioneers drilled with B. Company this morning, & will continue to do so until Further orders. From 12 p.m. yesterday until 12 pm. Today we made 245 miles about 10 knots an hour against a head wind all the time. A very heavy sea broke over our bows last night and smashed some rafts. It is said that it is the heaviest wave that ever broke over the Persic or rather A 34 as she is now called while being used as a troop transport. Just about dark land was sighted and about 9 o'clock ship's time we were along side the pier at Albany. 
 The harbour is a beautiful land backed sheet of water and at the entrance the pilot came aboard, and told us of the Great British Naval Victory over the Germans in the North Sea, and the loss of Kitchener and the whole of his Staff on their way to Russia.
