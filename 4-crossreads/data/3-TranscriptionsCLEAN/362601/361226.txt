28 June, Saturday
W.Awful gale raging. I get up & do an hour's work. Lie down behind screen on seat all day. Dinner & tea but I refuse pork. I read about mysteries of Marseilles. Go to bed after an hour's work at Tea time.
29 June, Sunday.
F.Lovely day. Cool. Gale ceased but huge swell. Breakages galore. I feel more safe & work all the time. I write & read Milton. Go to bed at 9 pm.
