6/9/15 Johnston's Jolly
trenches are said to be good. All up early. Aeroplane reconnoitring puffs of shells all round. "Beachy Bill" a gun concealed in olive groves gives beach a bad time. The shells are whizzing overhead now and three have burst on a rise just the other side of our gully. The men getting kit ready for move into firing line and are busily cleaning up. They had erected little tents with their blankets and ground sheets. Some were sleeping among dreadful stench as under their beds were dead Turks and others buried. Fell in 8.30 and whole battalion in single file commenced to move into trenches opposite Johnstons Jolly. The long line in file extended right up only to top. Put 500 into firing line and stowed 500 others in old trenches and dug outs on a hill called Braunds Hill. Met Major Carl Jess Brigade Major and went along with him and took over from the Adjt.
