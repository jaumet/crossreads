Did he ever get it?Ere this you will have heard of the sinking of the "Hampshire" with Kitchener on board - So far his body has not been recovered, & I still live in hopes that he will be saved in one of the boats which were sent to leave the ship's side. - Eric Greenwell is here & looking very well. Also Wybergh Docker - A nice chap - The latter told me he had a letter from his sister Mrs Norman Read, in which she mentioned "having seen you & that you looked blooming". Which I was pleased to hear. - Mrs Read of "Gowan Brae" sent me a very fine edition of the "Graphic" lately. Very good of her, was it not?Mr Hughes inspected the first Aus. Brigade about a week ago. - He made a very poor, ungrammatical speech, & had not the common decency to apologise for turning up two hours late. - Andrew Fisher was with him & appeared resplendent in Leggings, Khaki Riding pants, & a white coat. He looked (save for the leggings & pants) more like an ice-cream
