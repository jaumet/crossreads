<p>victory on Sunday.<br/>I wonder if it is the beginning of the end; they always said it would it would be when the fleet came out.<br/>Fred Rostron is here in the same ward with me; so I have got a mate and they do look after you well.<br/>Fancy a good bed to sleep on and butter &amp; eggs and jelly for tea.<br/>Please ask the boys to send me another print of yours and Fathers photos; those I had are stuck together and spoilt.<br/>I will answer all your letters next mail; Jack Dawson has a father at Toorawenah via Gilgandra but he is an uneducated man.<br/>I sent Father Rostron's address, he has a mother I know they are getle folk.</p>
