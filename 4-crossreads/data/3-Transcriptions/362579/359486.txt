<p>I'm having the day-off. So meeting her at Paddington   &amp;  we go out together then, to Highgate.</p>
<p>My lunch was in this week in the way of parcels.</p>
<p>A cake from Mrs Baynes family arrived on Monday. It was a beauty &ndash; we finished it last night. How very good of them remembering me, especially now. We cannot buy any decent cakes &ndash; no fruit or sugar allowed to be used on luxuries. such a lovely sweet one too.</p>
<p>Yesterday a nice little present from Bessie came. A cake of soap   &amp;  a slip bodice</p>
