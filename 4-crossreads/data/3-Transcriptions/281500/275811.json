<p>incinerator, this last thing is a most important duty and the Ist Battalion has made it a point of honour to leave all billets cleaner than they found them so you can guess they are pretty clean when we finish with them, just before moving off the officers and Dr inspect the billets and if they are not up to standard well the Sergeant gets a row.<br/>After this we fall the men in and inspect them, see that all packs are packed properly and are uniform and that they are short of nothing, after this we call the roll, number off and we are ready for marching off. <br/>From Ribemont to our present quarters is a march of about 10 miles and quite far enough with full packs up. Tonight we are comfortably quartered some difference to our last time in here we are sleeping in big semicircular</p>
