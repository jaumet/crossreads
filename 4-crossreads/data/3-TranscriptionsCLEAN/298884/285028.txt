This immediately put everybody in a fearfully bad humour & I received some of the backwash of the flood of indignation from the men when I went below to examine their food. They were nearly as savage as I was. From our anchorage here we can see the Manly ferries dashing to & fro with their loads of summerclad dress clad trippers waving & yelling.  At various periods all day until late at night boats containing relatives of chaps on board came along & created a bit of a diversion for the fed up troops.
