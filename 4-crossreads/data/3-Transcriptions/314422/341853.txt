<p>caught an underground train for Paddington Station and took a train for Denham 30 miles from London to see Willie and then motored out to the Harefield Hospital only to find that Willie had gone on furlough this morning so I had dinner and came back to London to Marylebone Station and then went by the tube railway to the War Chest Club where I am staying tonight. I bought an Ingsol watch this evening for 17/6. I lost the old one I bought from Victoria last Christmas</p>
