<p>25 Monday<br/>We only had two wounded patients today, the first since we had the wounded German major.  Preparations were made for a stunt which was supposed to come off during the night, but nothing happened.  Every thing was exceptionally quiet during the evening.  A beautiful day.  I wrote seven letters during the day &amp; sent 3 handerchiefs to my sisters &amp; one to my mother.</p>
<p>26 Tuesday<br/>A fellow couldn't wish for better weather than we are getting here now, although it gets rather cold of a night time.  There are 5 big 12" guns being placed round here, one was fixed up this afternoon &amp; fired 8 shots, the sound nearly deafens a person, you can see the shell of this gun if you look intently, when it is fired.  One of our airoplanes was brought down this morning, &amp; the Pilot died of wounds this afternoon, he was only 16 years old.</p>
<p>27 Wednesday<br/>There are two anti-aircraft guns about two hundred yards away &amp; we are practically surrounded by 18 pounders up to 12 inch guns.  They make a terrible row when they all start.  Pte Whiting gave me 3 francs (2/6) to do his shift on gas picket, I was on from 12.30 am till 3.30 am 28/th. I read nearly all the time, that is when the rats kept quiet.</p>
