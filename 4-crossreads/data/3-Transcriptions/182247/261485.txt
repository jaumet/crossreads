<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Rose 6 am.&nbsp; Nice day again.&nbsp; Sea like a mirror all day.&nbsp; No parade, only for washing purposes but having done mine yesterday, spent day in the shade of one of the boats on poop deck, reading &quot;Souls in Pawn&quot;.&nbsp; In afternoon did some sewing below, cleaned leggings and boots ready for leave at the next port, wherever that might be.&nbsp; While there a submarine warning was sounded and I donned my belt and carried out instructions given during previous drill.&nbsp; Did some letter writing home.&nbsp; After tea went on deck and had a yarn, smoke and a sing song.&nbsp; Slept on poop deck for first time.&nbsp; Turned in about 9.30.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Saturday.&nbsp; Did Morse in morning.&nbsp; Norman and I detailed for drilling holes for hammocks in girders on hospital deck.&nbsp; Did the job after much fussing and hard work.&nbsp; Had to go down into Engine Room to get tools for the work.&nbsp; Got scared as I passed along rows of huge moving machinery and was rather glad to get on deck again out of the clatter and heat of the engine room.&nbsp; After tea, ship&#39;s crew gave a concert.&nbsp; Did not go.&nbsp; Wrote letters instead.</td>
