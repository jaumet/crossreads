<p>Wednesday 20th March<br/>Four of our men went out this morning to put the finishing touches to the job. I had to make the concrete inside look pretty by sticking mud in any little cracks &amp; holes reminded me of my childhood makeing mud pies &amp; just about as usefull. The Major came along. He did not like the job some of it badley done &amp; to a certain extent he is right. Several nights while we were working the concrete would freese while hung mixed &amp; putting in reinforcements in the dark is no easy matter but even allowing for that some of the work could have been better. This M.G. Post was a half circular construction butting on to an old Hun Pill box. It is about 6' high inside &amp; the same in diameter with walls about 2' thick &amp; roof 4' thick solid concrete. We have had to make most of our own frames out of any thing we could find so that naturally the inside is rough</p>
