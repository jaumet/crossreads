<p>Bunkum.  There are hundreds of nice girls around here but I never go out.  I have been to Dances &amp; so has Ellis &amp; Dick, but the Dance over we come back &amp; hide ourselves from them as from shells.  Not that there is any reason for this, but we have too much reading &amp; writing &amp; general tidying up &amp; sewing &amp; washing &amp; shaving &amp; boot cleaning etc.  Of course we don't have to do these things every night but the Girls take a fellow out every night &amp; I'm sure I would have a bust up with one of 'em.  I've always said that they are good pastime &amp; when one can pick 'em up &amp; set 'em</p>
