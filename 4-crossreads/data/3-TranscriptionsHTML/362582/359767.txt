<p>P.S. Did I tell you that Norman Bower wrote to me from Alexandria, said he was coming to Cairo for 3 weeks &amp; would like to see me, so I wrote &amp; told him to come to hospital, where he would find me. He sent his love to Aunt Belle, &amp; to cousin Belle, Ethel &amp; Alice. He wrote such a nice little letter. Had just got one from his mother, saying I was here. Poor old Keith wrote me a short note just on leaving camp &amp; asked me to tell his mother they were all well &amp; in good spirits. Must stop now. Fondest love &amp; kisses Edith</p>
