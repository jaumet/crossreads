<p>1916 &nbsp; TUESDAY 26 &nbsp; SEPT.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; warm. Revielle at 5.30 and we all paraded in marching order and marched over to Bulford where we joined up with the rest of the 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Division. A lot of the artillary was mounted with their guns (18 pounders &amp; howitzers). It was a fine sight to see all the mounted artillary &amp; infantry with fixed bayonets marching past and a few aeroplanes over-head flying about. We got back to camp some time after 7 pm a very tired but happy lot. Got a letter from M<sub><sup>​</sup></sub><sup>r</sup>&nbsp;LLoyd dated 23<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Aug.</p>
