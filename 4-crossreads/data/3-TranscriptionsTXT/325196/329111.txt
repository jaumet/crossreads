A Greek was on the scene early & did a good trade selling bread jam etc.; B Sqd stayed a village named Fant & are to do patrol duty from there; about 50 miles towards Cairo; A Sqd are about 30 or 40 miles farther on from here; Each squadron had a train each; I believe C.Sqd of the 2nd Regt. went through late last night & are going out farther still; A Troop of this Sqd went out at 10 oclock today to look for a camping place for us tonight we followed at 1.P.M. & after a 9 or 10 miles ride through cultivated lands, we crossed a canal on barges & camped close by a village on the edge of the desert.  Armored trains patrol the lines now & it is expected that we shall clash with Senoussi's shortly
