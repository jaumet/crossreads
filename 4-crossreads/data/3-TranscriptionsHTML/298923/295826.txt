<p>9 June 1918 Sunday<br/>Just fired at a Snake with revolver but of course missed him they live in the cracks of the Rocks.  Mosquitoes very bad here-   I have a dirty old net<strike>t</strike> am glad to say-<br/>The stillness here 1000s feet below the sea, is like waiting for a thunderstorm that never comes-  Bag of snakes today included a puff headed adder- fatal in about 8 minutes, all Jackos carry Snakebite antidote but we have none yet.<br/>Camels bring us Water rations at night time &amp; we show no lights or movements-</p>
