<p>I think the macuna  &amp; quails must have been on issue. There was another cheeky gentleman from the 2nd Reg when we were at El Arish Past, who put a loaf of bread in his haversack &amp; said goodbye &amp; told his "cobber" he was going to walk home. He started too, along the wire road, but only covered about 10 miles when he was brought back &amp; put in hospital; he turned out to be slightly mad, so got home after all &amp; much quicker too.<br/>We have a surf club here now</p>
