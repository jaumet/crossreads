<p>Tues 12-12-16</p>
<p>Our chaps went out on the lines again last night. Thank goodness this is the last night for a while anyway. They fixed up communication once again &amp; for a wonder all lines are holding. This morning I went out side &amp; found the snow falling very fast in large flakes. The ground everywhere white &amp; even walking about showed up very plainly. Everybody has grown a beard or a moustache &amp; as very few brought towels &amp; the water being frozen almost every morning most of us could do with a good wash, to say nothing of a clean change of clothing.</p>
