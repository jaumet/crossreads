<p>MALTA</p>
<p>Yesterday we were [giveing?] a Drive and we went out to the orange gardens wich are about 4 miles from the hospital&nbsp; The Gardens are very pretty indeed and well worth a trip too. on the way out you could not but wonder at the way the Maltese make paddock. They are all partitioned off with Brick walls and Some of them would not make a decent backyard. Maltese like the Egyptians are all for money. Going along the Streets in Either places you are Stopped and asked for money here it is the Children&nbsp;&nbsp; But Egypt it is Everbody&nbsp; [I am?]</p>
