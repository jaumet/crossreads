 FEBRUARY 1917 
 12 MONDAY 
 Fine but dull &amp; cloudy. It was 
 warm though &amp; most of the snow 
 has melted off the ground now. 
 I went for a bath in the morning 
 &amp; cleaning harness all of afternoon. 
 The gun team had to turn out 
 in morning at 4 am &amp; take our 
 gun down to near the trenches 
 &amp; went up again in evening to 
 bring it back. 
 Got letters from Mother &amp; Aunty 
 Florence. They have not been 
 getting my letters &amp; are very 
 anxious. The postal arrangements 
 are rotten here.
