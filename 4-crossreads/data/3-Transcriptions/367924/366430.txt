<p>Well I am writing this letter in a hurry, as we are packing up to move. All the chaps from around Kojonup &amp; Katanning are in the best of health &amp; spirits, but would like to get back again. Of course you will have seen Levi long before you recieve this letter &amp; will hear a lot of news from him.</p>
<p>Remember me to all my friends, tell them it is impossible to write to them, I am only writing to you &amp; Nell &amp; Mrs. Birt Bilney an odd card to others. Tell Olive I will write to her when I can get more time. Well I must close with wishing you both the very best of Good Health &amp; Luck. I am pleased that you have Lassie. Kind regards to the Boss. I must close with sending you my Love &amp; best wishes. God Bless &amp; take care of you. Good Bye for the present.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your ever loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>Kisses for you<br/>X X X X X<br/>X X X X X<br/>X X X X</p>
