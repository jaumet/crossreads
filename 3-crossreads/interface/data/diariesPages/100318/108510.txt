runner was rather at sea and we had a lot of chasing about before finding McCartin. With him we pushed forward to locate the posts and got right out into No Man's Land. Low whistling brought a reply from our rear and we walked back and into the posts. He was using an extremely fast gun like a .75 tonight and appeared very nervous. After seeing Westaway and Armstrong we had a rather uneventful walk round the remainder of the line. Had a yarn to Mr. ?Barney" Oldfield at ?C" Coy and found the men very tired and war worn. Returned to Bn HQ about m.n. and had the pleasure of being bombed from by a Hun plane just as we got in.
