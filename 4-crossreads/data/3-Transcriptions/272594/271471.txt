<p>Left Etaples this morning &amp; marched down to the train, &amp; soon we were bowling merrily along, it was pretty cold for a start, but in the afternoon the weather took a turn for the better.  We went through Amiens &amp; Corbie this time &amp; called at Albert about 2 oclock &amp; then marched to the Reinforcement Camp just outside Albert &amp; and here we all got our respirators &amp; tested them, after this I came into Albert &amp;</p>
