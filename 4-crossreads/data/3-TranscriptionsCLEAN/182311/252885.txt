 My Dear People, 
    Well here we are out of the line again & with a little time to put in letter writing. 
    Recently I have felt horribly guilty for writing so little but I hope in view of the busy time that I have had lately to be excused. 
    The sector that we held this time was fortunately a very quiet one, & our casualties few, the main excitement was concentrated shoots on our positions, by the German Minenwerfers & though t  there was plenty of that it caused surprisingly little damage. 
    "Minnie" the vernacular for Minenwerfer (Mine thrower) is a girl who has a comparatively thin cast iron-skin, she is fired from a trench mortar & is packed with high explosive.  Her approach is heralded by the  pop  distinctive pop of the "Minnie" gun.
