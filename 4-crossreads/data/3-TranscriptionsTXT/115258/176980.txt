This morning some reinforcements marched in and with them came Cpl Edwards. I was jolly glad to see him back. He has been nine weeks trying to get out of Moascar; which is a more heart breaking place than a prison we reckon. It does seem a shame to spoil good soldiers like that! Jim Ayre has been appointed "curio king" for the regiment which means that he has to collect trophies for this new war museum they are getting up. I have just been reading that book "The Origin and Nature of Life" for a second time. it is wonderfully interesting alright. Think I'll stop this gossip now Mother dear and write again soon. Love to Father, Hal & Fred and yourself. I am
