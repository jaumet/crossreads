<p>17/1/19 Brussels<br/>and down this very fine crowded street until 7.15 when we returned to the Theatre. Entering we went up stairs and then into our very good seats. The Theatre Royale of Bruxelles seems to make no pretence to rivalling Paris as far as ornament and fittings go. It is very badly ventilated and being also artificially heated the smell is soon unpleasant. "Faust" was played on the whole very well but the first act was not too good largely owing to his beard being not white, long enough, or well fitting. Between acts one could walk out and I met Keith Sutherland, Carricks and Howell all who were having a good time. At the Hotel afterwards we had supper and there was dancing &ndash; the gayest scene here. Continued till 2 or 3 in the morning but I left at 1.</p>
