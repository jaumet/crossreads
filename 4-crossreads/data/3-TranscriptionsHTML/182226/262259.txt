<p>Wednesday 25 August, 1915</p>
<p>Was sent to the base for overcoats about 6 miles altogether. We were sniped at more than was comfortable. I carried the coats on the side nearest the enemy, &quot;just in case&quot;. In the afternoon I had to dig a gun position &amp; deepen a trench.</p>
<p>Our dinner consisted of boiled rice, biscuits, jam, bovril &amp; bully beef, with tea. I was cook for Mac &amp; I.</p>
<p>Slept out in the open all night, was glad of my overcoat. It is considered bad form to run here or to duck - for anything except shrapnel, anything is permissable for that. In fact when we had to go out in the open under shrapnel one chap dropped what he was carrying &amp; beat it for his life. The next day, the general came along &amp; frightened seven years growth out of him. Told him he could have him shot for it, but he said he&#39;d do it again under similar circumstances.</p>
