With Captain Blackwood ashore for the day. Am much disgutted by the extreme delay. No word of sailing date is yet settled. Here are we a few hundred miles from London, and 10 days elapsed! Of course there are undoubtedly satisfactory reasons, , but why on earth were we not allowed to join the vessel at this port and so save at least a week's time.
Weather delightful. Spent the day in making small purchases and walking around the city which is but a poor recreation. Ship at 7.30 pm.
