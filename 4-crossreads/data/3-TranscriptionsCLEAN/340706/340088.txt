Most of the country now resembles English countries in south the villages are uniformly situated in depths of valleys whether to escape winds or on account of water supply I do not know but there are few exceptions to this rule. 
 This route is new to me & I have not remembered the names of the stations but we have missed all hitherto well known names. The nearest station to the camp is Harfluer so we proceed about 5 miles further on as this is the usual military way of doing things. We detrain & then have to march back again to boy leading the way. 
 We go first to the old Conv. Camp for purpose of being deloused. Here rain has been heavy & everywhere you flounder through mud. As night has come on & lights are scase things are not pleasant but  like  luckily we strike Creighton & he show us round let us wash in his room & finally gives us a supper of preserved fruit & tea in his room. 
 Our quarters here are damnable after the comfort of a bed for the last 3 mos. However I have the knack of being able to sleep anyhow & anywhere so this not not inconvenience me much 
 4-5-19 (Mon) This camp is for purpose of delousing everyone & organisation is very thorough
