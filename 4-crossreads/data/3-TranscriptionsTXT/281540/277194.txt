In my little home in a Trench(Tune Little grey home in the West)
II've a little wet home in a trenchWhich the rainstorms continually drenchThere are dead Turks all roundAll polluting the groundOh they give us a beautiful stenchUnderneath in the place of a floorThere's a mass of wet mud & some goreAnd the "Jess Willards" bearThrough the rain sodden airO'er my little wet home in the trench
IIThere are snipers who keep on the goSo you must keep your old napper down lowAnd their star shells at nightMake a deuce of a lightWhich causes the language to flowThen biscuits & bully we chewFor its weeks since we tasted a stewBut with shells bursting thereThere's no place can compareWith my little wet home in the trench
