 Wednesday 19 February 1919 Heard a peculiar lecturer today &ndash; a Black Jew, born in Dahdmen near Timbuctoo, educated in Glasgow, with a Scotch accent.  Claimed to belong to the lost tribe of Simeon? practised Polygamy, wore no clothes, till he ran away &amp; got on a Tramp Steamer at the Gold Coast, fluent, dramatic, &amp; amusing, held his audience spellbound.  Not sure he was all he said, but C.O. Jewish Battalion guaranteed him.  West who married Brice Fiddle has got his commission. The Division has bought a fishing boat &amp; nets &amp; carted to sea, idea fish for the men &ndash; some wag has branded the boat ANZACS, last hope for home.
