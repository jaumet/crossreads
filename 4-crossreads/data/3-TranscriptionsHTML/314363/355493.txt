<p>Tuesday Aug 22nd .<br/>Am now in the forward area, arrived here yesterday evening, &amp; had rather an exciting time.<br/>I left the details with the ration limbers about 4 pm, at first we made good progress, all being quiet, until we were about one kilo from HQ, there we had a halt, for the road ahead was being shelled. After a while we started off again in small parties, leaving some little distance between, the limber got well ahead, &amp; suddenly three or four shells burst just in front of it, the driver turned his horses about &amp; galloped back, in the meantime we had got over alongside a ridge, the limber reached about fifteen yards from where we were, when another 5.9, I think <strike>furs</strike> burst just ahead of it, the blast went forward &amp; cut <strike>the</strike> on of the horses in half, broke the front pole of limber, we had a lively time for about half an hour, but we kept low. Eventually a new pole was fitted in &amp; we arrived without further mishap.<br/>My friends have a lot to say about the advance, it would have gone much further if the Tommies had not failed on our left.</p>
