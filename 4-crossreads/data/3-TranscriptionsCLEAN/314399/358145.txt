Band played for he's a jolly good fellow. Hawker bowed & crowd demanded a speech. They got 'Thank you very much indeed'. Show was very good indeed. Enjoyed it. 
 Thursday 29 May 1919 Sorted out photos for my album. Had phone messages from Dad H. Met Bill at 4.15 & rushed to Paddington to see Dad but got there only just in time to have a look thro half the train. didn't see him. Had dinner & then went to see Eyes of Youth. Liked it very much. Brought Bill home & we both slept in my bed. Some crowd too.
