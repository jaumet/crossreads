Wednesday night 17th Oct  Had a strenuous day instead of going to bed. Two of us went to [indecipherable] & "Bailleue" about 10 or 11 miles away to see old friends. We walked part of the distance down & got a lift by a lorry reaching there in two hours. Had dinner with my friends & a good yarn it just being 12 months since I was last there. We then went to "Bailleue" where we spent a hour, when we set off home again at 5 P.M. reaching camp at 7 A.M. & going on duty at 8 P.M. We had a fair way to walk coming back & also boarded four vehicles during the journey luckily threatening rain held off until we reached camp. No train in during the night so managed to snatch a few hours sleep which made up for not having any during the day.
Thursday night 18th Oct  No train during the night so did some writing & addressed my Xmas cards for Australia and
