<p>2 January 1918 Wednesday<br/>I have a tent here at Moascar but the Regt are all in Dug-outs &amp; Bivies<br/>On Court Martial again in the morning, spent last night at N.Z. Mess with Colin McLeish playing bridge-  Just got orders to leave for the front in the morning with 500 hundred men, it is cold wet &amp; perishing up there now.  Posted Notes by a man going to Australia today envelope will be stamped in Melbourne.<br/>I hope you &amp; Daisy get a trip to Melbourne again-   We are all disgusted at the result of the Referendum.</p>
