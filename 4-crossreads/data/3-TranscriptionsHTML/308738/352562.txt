<p>Dec. 4 Saturday 1915<br/>In bed all day<br/>General Maxwell came &amp; looked through the Hospital.<br/>I hear that Lieu Hordern is in this Hospital sick<br/>Got letters from Home what a joy it is to read them. I look &amp; long for the day to come when I shall see those Dear Faces again.<br/>Poor Girl she has the hard time. We men do not know what anxiety is.

<p>Dec. 5 Sunday 1915<br/>In bed all day<br/>Feeling a bit better though my food does me little good.<br/>Service held down stairs can hear them sing, but cannot attend</p>
<p>Dec. 6 Monday 1915<br/>In bed all day<br/>The days are long lying in bed. I often wish they would send me Home, but I fear that my turn is a long way off yet. There are so many much worse that I have only a small chance</p>
