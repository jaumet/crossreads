<p>December 1916<br/>5th   I have been off duty all day &amp; at 4 p.m. I went out with a sapper &amp; a party of 10 Infantry men to Rose Trench to continue with the Duck Walk track.   We arrived there about 5 &amp; did a couple of hours work using all the available duckboards.  Fritz sent over a few shells with occasional schrapnel, near where we were working, but no damage was done.  In daylight we would have been under observation but as <strike>the</strike> it is dark about 4.30, we were not handicapped to a great extent.  A few rifle bullets wissed around us but shell fire was the worse.</p>
