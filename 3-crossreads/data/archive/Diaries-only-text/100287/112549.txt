was one of the first to suffer, he took it all in good part, the ships officers crew were also ducked, it has afforded us quite a lot of fun if nothing else, whats more I have got a lovely sunburnt back body arms out of it, the day has been a regular scorcher, the sea a bit like one huge sheet of plate glass not a ripple breaks its shiny surface save here there where flying-fish keep leaping out, from what I can learn of these fish they must lead a pretty hazardous life for everything that swims is an enemy of the flying fish they even eat one another at times this is because they have 2 ways of evading their enemies I suppose is Natures way of adjusting the balance.
I believe I saw the "Southern Cross"
