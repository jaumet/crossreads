<p>December 1915<br/>Saturday 18<br/>Fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orders to pack up ready to vacate the peninsular. It seems a pity that all such splendidly worked out plans should have gone astray. The difficulties were not in surmountable but they were not tackled in the right manner Grave discredit reflects on someone at present unknown.</p>
<p>Sunday 19<br/>We left the peninsular last night leaving 6 of our section behind for the last. Enough men have been left to man the firing line in case of emergency. We boarded the boat last night about 11 PM. and arrived here at Lemnos about daybreak. We had a long march to our camp.</p>
