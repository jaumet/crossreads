June 1 thusly - "You were unlucky enough to stop one"? - Yes. "Alright - you needn't wait". Exit me.Tip top Concert tonight. First class singing, reciting & acting, & a slashingly original comic - one of the best ive seen. The party comes down to Harefield every Thursday night.
2 Reveille woke me this morning. The twilight lasts for such a darned long time in this country, that a fellow cant get to sleep. Passed one Board but have to go before another tomorrow mng. Rec'd 9 letters from Aust & 3 from Eng - all addressed to Egypt. Waited round the Office for 2 or 3 hours, & was told to come back - later -
3  Won a game of Croquet; "for a wonder" Rather chilly in the shade but good on the Lawn.Went before the board, but know nil. Also saw the Major re a glass eye. Am to visit him again on Wed & the dentist on Monday.
