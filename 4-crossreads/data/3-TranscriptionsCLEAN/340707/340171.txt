We are 4 3 men & a woman - all without money all Bohemian - a girl - a poet, a painter & myself who might be called a writer
The top attic the freedom of idea & get a girl confident of her self - & when she points to the dawn with a gesture, I hear in every cubic inch of air the strains of Boheme Puccini might have been present in the room.
