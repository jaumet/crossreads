Tune: Rock of Ages
Australia's battle Hymn.
God that made our Fathers strong
Lead us when the dangers throng
God that made our mothrs pure
Make us steadfast to endure
On the waves or tent or field
Be our sword and battle shield
Hail our Empire spreading far
Great in peace and dread in war
Banner brave as in the past
Float on fort and tower and mast
Let thy blazon flutter free
South and North and every sea
Here thy sons shall guard the gates
of thy southward shores and straits
On wide ocean we shall meet
One unsundered flag and fleet
And the pathway of the sea 
Prove our broadening destiny
Oh for peace or battle pray
Nelson's signal points the way
Duty's claim and country's call
Shall be our concience for us all
Set that signal high and then
"Forward" Quit yourselves like men.
     
    Refrain
God that watest through the day
Gurad each seaward coast and bay
God in loves unsleeping might
Keep our homes through darkest night
