through tunnels I was tingling all over from the concussion, the big shell 9.2 had not landed more than 3 yards from me marvellous to say I was not touched, all the metal seemed to fly forward for everything in front was absolutely riddled torn to pieces, if it had acted as high explosive generally does I would have been torn to ribbons, as it was at any rate I got quite big enough shock to last me for a while, he threw these great shells among our Coy. all the morning wonderful to say never got a man though he put the "wind up" a lot.
One of our fatigue parties had a terrible experience this morning they got caught in a salvo of "heavies", poor old Snowy Hills got blown to pieces Charlie Crane Costello were also killed Costello had his head blown off, we buried the 3 of them this afternoon. 1 Sgt 1 Cpl 1 Pvt. Neville Chalinbers were wounded they are giving us "Hell" again this afternoon they seem to have got us set to some order.
