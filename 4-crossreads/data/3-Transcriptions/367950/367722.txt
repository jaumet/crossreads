Phillip Chetwood who is the new Desert Column Commander along with Major General Chauvel Commanding the ANZAC Mounted Division. He was our old Brigadier until after the Evacuation of Gallipoli.

<p>16th December Gerarat Saturday<br/>Went out this morning on a special patrol with some officers belonging to the Divisional Staff. They are out reconnoitring and taking careful compass bearings and various other pieces of information destined to become useful soon. We went much further than any previous patrol getting about 5 miles from El Arish. We saw plenty of Turks on outpost duty a good distance off we did not fire on them and they did not fire on us probably realising that there would be plenty of time for that. They have outposts all along the sea coast</p>
