Signals (continued)And he knows from a hundred signals, the buzzing call of his own.The breaks and the vibrant stresses &ndash;The Z and the G and the S's,That call his hand to the answering key and his mouth to the microphone.
For always the laid guns fretOn the words that his mouth shall utter,When rifle and maxim stutter,And the rockets volley to starward from the spurting parapet;And always his ear must harkto the voices out of the dark &ndash;For the whisper over the wireFrom the bombed and the battered trenches,Where the wounded moan on the mire &ndash;For a sign to waken the thunderwhich shatters the night asunderWith the flash of the leaping muzzles and the beat of battery fire.
