<p>day was breaking he had to take cover in an old crater, he was that hungry that he even took to eating green grass, he did not know what to do so he decided to have another go the next night, he gets up opposite the 12th. Battalion but they shot at him 12 times &amp; he was missed each time, so he put up his hands &amp; sang out to them they told him to keep low &amp; come in when they got him he was nearly starving, &amp; fairly rushed the bully &amp; biscuits, the Dr examined him &amp; found that he had nothing in his stomach, for they thought he might have been a spy, but it was a genuine case alright, he had quite an adventurous time didn't he, but it is so easy to miss your way in "No mans land" &amp; mistake the German</p>
