<p>29/11/19 Marseilles<br/>a wonderful contrast to up North. Green trees in full leaf &ndash; a grand sight. After running through rather rocky barren country abounding in funny old castles we swung out on to flatter land with many vines. Made Marseilles at noon and got a basket from the buffet. One does not get a good view of the city. The railway now ran along the sea and the sun was hot. At Toulon handed Madame of the opposite seat over to her husband a Commodore in the French Navy. The country from now on was very lovely. We came into St Raphael in daylight. The Corniche d'or commences here and a road fringes the sea the whole way. Many beautiful bays and fine villas. Green trees abound. Reached Nice at 6 and the old French couple who were so friendly got out and I had the place to myself. The</p>
