<p>Tuesday 29 June 1915</p>
<p>Nothing of moment.  Slept on deck to avoid close atmosphere of mess deck.</p>
<p>Wednesday 30th June 1915</p>
<p>4&frac12; days out:  life aboard ship already becoming monotonous.  Slept below:  very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Thursday 1st July 1915</p>
<p>Rough sea all day with strong head wind &ndash; the latter has been encountered all the way &ndash; things not all violets aboard &ndash; very damp.  Slept below in consequence.  Pleasant dreams of home as usual.</p>
<p>Friday 2nd July 1915</p>
<p>Reveille sounded to the tune of a howling gale with heavy rain &amp;</p>
