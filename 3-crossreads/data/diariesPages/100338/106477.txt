about like they smashed France.

Just try and Picture Germany in our position on the winning side, How much mercy do you think we would receive at their hands,

What chance would we Prisoners have of getting out of the country for years to come, if ever we got out alive at all. We would be treated exactly the same as they treated the French prisoners when they liberated France in 1890.

On the 25th I started work for the first time since the news of the Armistace.

When we stopped work the Germans stopped our food, We continued to live on the food that we received from England in our parcels, but these last three days we have run out of supplies so have started again until some more parcels come along.

On Wednesday the 27th I again stopped
