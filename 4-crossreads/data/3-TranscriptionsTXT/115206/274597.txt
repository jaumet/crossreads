 January 1918 Sunday 27 
 At Beutin Today has been a glorious day, I went for a walk this morning along a sunlit track bordered by trees on one side and hedges and a stream on the other. The morning air was frosty and sparkling. I came to an old log straddled across a tree. Here I sat and wrote a long letter home. &nbsp;We are being paid in all probability tomorrow.
