January 18th. To-day we were told that all the A.I.F. would be out of France in five months, but as to our 1915 men, uncertainty exists. Snowing a little to-day. 
January 27th. Doing nothing but loaf. Last night it snowed heavily and the ground is "tout blanc" We made a decent walk through the woods which are very pretty just now.
January 28th. Am going on leave to Paris soon. Have another walk through the snow covered woods.
