<p>Thursday 4th October 1917</p>
<p>Still hung up &ndash; we expected to get away today, now tomorrow - &amp; it is no use being impatient on active service. The ships come &amp; <strike>down</strike> go, through the Street as <u>it</u> appears of <strike>TARANTO</strike> - not unlike the scene in a comic Opera, where a big boat comes on the Stage. Beautiful sunsets &amp; still warm I am glad to say. Did not get off hope to do so tomorrow.</p>
<p>Convoys of French &amp; Italian troops go out each evening escorted by T.B.D.'s of different nations, the men are dressed in the Slate Blue uniforms of the Continent.</p>
<p><strike>No war news. Posted notes from TARANTO.</strike></p>
