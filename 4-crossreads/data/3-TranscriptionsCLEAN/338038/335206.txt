Many thanks for your letters of Xmas Day. Also papers which come regularly to hand.I am so thankful to hear you are still keeping well - Also have had letters from Pat up to Dec 20th -We are still plugging away here getting fit as fast as possible. Don't think I told you we have a new O.C. in this Battery. Major C.G.A.Miles who came away as Capt & Adjutant of the 2nd F.A.Brigade & got his promotion on the Peninsula. He was originally of the permanent Field Artillery in Melbourne and is a rattling good chap & knows his job thoroughly.
Had a letter from Ath Cochrane yesterday. He is in camp at Heliopolis waiting to join his Battalion. Cairo is very dead now. Have been up again on leave since I last wrote
