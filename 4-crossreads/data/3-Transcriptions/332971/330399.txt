<p>&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;corner to meet the mail I meet 3 ladies going for a &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;to Bucks Mills.  I receive an impromptu invitation &hellip;&hellip;the day with them.  It was such a nice day too &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;on the beach.  The next day I go on to Lynton &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;and see the magnificient Scenery around &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.  The waters meet in Lyn Valley &ndash; the Valley of rocks &amp; &hellip;..rock.  Now glancing up I see I have come to the 14th page &amp; must think of signing my name to all this.  And is it all worth the reading?  Do tell me my friends if I bore you.  It's my chief delight to write to you, &amp; I have lots to tell you yet, Time lately has been so precious &ndash; we have been ever so busy here. During our busiest time too the Influenza swept over us which involved extra work on those who kept well.  When the worst was over &ndash; help came &ndash; but I shall always think that they were sent <u>too late</u> &amp; at the price of death &ndash; for Sister Sakinton &ndash; one of our dear comrades who was with us in Lemnoss &amp; who felt she couldn't give in &ndash; one might say died at the post &ndash; for she was on duty the day previous &amp; died the next day at Southwell Gardens of Pneumonia.  It was a sad shock to us all.  The was buried in our peaceful corner with our own [indecipherable] boys.</p>
<p>I did not finish telling of my holiday then &amp; the last two days was the best that crowned all the others for they were lived &amp; loved with those dear friends who have been so good to me &ndash; The Robjohns at Bexhill, Mrs Robjohns is the dearest old lady it has been my priviledge to know &ndash; And her two daughter-in-law are just as charming as their lovely Mother &ndash; and equally as good are they to some of our Australian boys.</p>
<p>Good-bye dears.  I must stop now with ever so much love</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours<br/>Anne Donnell<br/>8.7.1918</p>
<p>PS:  From all accounts the Sammys and Aussies like each other well.  I thought they would.</p>
