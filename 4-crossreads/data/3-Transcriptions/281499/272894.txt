<p>Had a fairly liberal issue of rations this morning &amp; we want them badly too we also had 14 pair of clean socks per platoon not enough but better than none at all I suppose This morning Len &amp; I received a fair batch of letters they cheer one up considerably when things are miserable. Aunt Carrie especially is a very cheerful writer &amp; I must say all Aunties have acted tip top to Len &amp; I for they all write regularly &amp; send lots of parcel's, while I am afraid they do not hear too often from us, of course we have not the inclination nor time for letter writing &amp; I'm sure they understand that part of the business.<br/>This book is nearly in pieces for it has had a very rough time &amp; has been knocked about all over the place but so long as it hangs together till it gets home that's all I care for it can be recopied again.</p>
