 9 February 1918 Saturday Still raining &amp; snow on the Hills  just heard WADI GHUZZI washed Railway Line away again so rations &amp; horsefeed will be scarcer. Oranges are now issued in lieu of vegetables. The horse Lines get ankle deep in mud &amp; we've not had a decent wash for days- Rum issue every night.  Boils under both arms &amp; Skin trouble little better, only trifles, but not pleasant in the wet soldiering.
