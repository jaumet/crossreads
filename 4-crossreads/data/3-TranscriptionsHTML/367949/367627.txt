<p>The Bowling Green at my Home is alright &ndash; it is just closed down for Top dressing, and no doubt when you return to this country we will often see you on Sunday.</p>
<p>The last Election did not come as a surprise to me &ndash; the Electors were appealed to in their most intelligent part, their stomachs; the meatshops, and similar proposed schemes carried the day, and will always carry the day in this country, while there is very little patriotism, among the general body of native born.</p>
<p>Business is not too flourishing, and there are big possibilities of a slump, we are a very poor community of non-producers, except raw products, and when the pawnbroker ceases to lend, the fat will be in the fire.</p>
<p>Jameson's best now costs money, but when you reach the <strike>side</strike> City <strike>of</strike> on Liffey's Banks I don't fancy you will drink anything else.</p>
<p>With kind regards, and best wishes for your safe return.</p>
<p>I remain,<br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>[Signature indecipherable]</p>
