<p>when I think of you which isn't at all seldom.  Keep up your pecker &amp; I'll be out soon &amp; the chins will rave.  You'll have to be very firm to choke me off for I shall bore you quite likely.</p>
<p>Your letters are absolutely the choicest things.  I won't remark on the handwriting but you ought to know I wouldn't have the most perfect copper plate in place of it.</p>
<p>Au Revoir<br/>Yours<br/>Wilki</p>
<p>I know what a heart tearing biz it is to read Jock's letters when you know he has gone.  I'm still getting Jim's.  I'm still in the field &amp; don't really want to leave, while my pals are here too but if they keep on going &amp; the weather &amp; things are too awful well I dunno, I'm pretty safe as I'm not a bit brave &amp; daring.  Good night.  Love to the Boss &amp; Graham &amp; Mac also you.</p>
