  
 October 14 53. Today I become qualified to wear the two service stripe no-one in the unit wears, perhaps as well, for two look meagre beside the three many could wear. 
 The loveliest memory of today two years as the calling to mind, and it comes always fresh, of the sun setting and flinging its millions of golden arrows on the dark water... and after that the passing between the heads. 
 The night black and the water black, and suddenly the searchlight from South & Middle heads on the water and full on the A.17, and the 'Captain Cook', and the Captain Cook's siren shrieked.  "You noisy barstard!" and as he said it by my side he half sobbed.  We were crowded on the first deck, embarked on our great adventure... two years ago.  Those memories and of the months in camp are good. .. The crowded train that left Sydney at 11.30, and brought us to camp about 1, and the singing crowd on the station then, on the bridge and steps, and the rush for the taxi for the A.M.C. & Light Horse camps... and from the Measles, Mumps and V.D. Compounds too. 
 Liverpool and those terrible winds that brought great clouds of red dust on them, and the heavy rain that swamped half the Infanty  lines , and the rich sun and the road by the camp that we used every morning, the road between tall trees and one lovely patch of wattles. 
 And how Liverpool we cursed! 
 Mail today from Elsie  "The Sydney Mail" of July 18. 
 54.  October 15 To the coffee and cake shop by the rail gates of Poys. for supper with Clarrie and Frank, last night. 
 From the camp by the time we'd reached the Popys. road, the mists had risen high from the ground:  and the sky was blue grey, with the first faint stars coming out.  I was watching them as their light came visible, when one great flame quickly grew over where the lines run.  As it sank slowly into the mist the gold of it grew, and till it had fallen right out of sight and a while after, the then incense like rising smoke and sparks made a high fantasy into the night.
