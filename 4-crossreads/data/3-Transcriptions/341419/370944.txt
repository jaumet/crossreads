<p>so I am afraid that the wet weather is on us in earnest now.  It is unfortunate.  I had hoped that we would be back at Wadi Hinane <strike>before</strike> where the other two Bgdes. have made what appears to be a permanent camp, before the rain came.</p>
<p>Now there is every probability of an unpleasant wet trek in front of us over two ranges of mountains before we can get settled down &amp; watertight.</p>
<p>Suiweileh, 25.10.18<br/>What a wonderful Prophet I am.  We moved today directly it started to rain &amp; are now faced with the pleasant prospect of a wet dreary trek right to Beisan which is where we are heading I believe.  And so well a fervent prayer for good weather, to bed.</p>
