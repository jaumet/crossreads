 Eventually I will be posted to one of our Australian Training Squadrons (as a Cadet) but  wi  whether it will be Nos, 5, 6, 7, or 8, I don't know.

There is no doubt that Britain is in a serious position as regards the food problem, but I don't for a minute believe it is as bad as they try to make out; it is simply that the food is held up until it eventually has to be destroyed as unfit for consumption. We are only about an hour's run from the Metropolis here, but it doesn't worry me at all for I realise that it pays a man to stick closely to his work whilst going through a course like this, for with
