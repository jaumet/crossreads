 July 1916 20th &ndash; Aeroplanes very busy Taubes bombed Suez. Reports state Turks entrenching at Oghratina (a mile or so this side &amp; our troops dug in about two miles distant Narrow escape of our unit. Stationed Qatia all day. B'de unprepared &amp; attack was expected 'tween two &amp; three am brigade prepared to retire as enemy far too strong. Rfts being rushed up &amp; artillery being brought out. Redoubts being built &amp; manned by inf. About 11 pm, brigade returned, having evacuated Qatia. Qatia too exposed to be held by either side. Hot reception awaiting Abdul. Few prisoners capt. NZ patrol narrow escape. 21st &ndash; Aeroplane reports Abdul busy German officers being in charge. About 4000 camels. Few odd prisoners brought in who seemed pleased to be captured. &amp; seem to be in underdressed &amp; underfed. They report 21st &ndash; that Turks number 8400. Twelve regts of 700 each. I'm inclined to doubt their statements. Seem fishy. Looks a put up job. Believe Brig. giving them great kidstakes. Prisoners report that eight field guns with Turks &amp; that Turks are only advance guard &amp; a Turk division. Don't believe it. Personally I think is only an attempt to draw large British forces from Flanders. Aeroplanes report Turks going toward sea Dueidar. Attack  feared  expected from that source thro night or early morning. Two Taubes over camps. First time two have appeared. Regts moved out about 1am beares accompanying Tent subdiv remaining behind. Tried hard but no go. [Note in margin:]   Stretton returned having left my photos at a Dago's shop. Not satisfied with name of place
