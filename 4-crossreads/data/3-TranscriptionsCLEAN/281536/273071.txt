16/6/19 Sutton-Venyand bright sunlight - contrast to the sombreness and mustiness of many continental cathedrals. Old recumbent effigied tombs of crusaders and others and very fine brass and iron work on the choir railings. After coming out took a walk round the close and enjoyed the slightly distant view of the building. Caught a train back to Warminster at 1 and had tea at Sutton Veny Greenhills. After dinner went with Blanch to tennis and afterwards to No. 1 AGA and a long talk with Sr Donaldson.
17/6/19A boring monotonous day. Tried a few Orderly Room cases, had afternoon tea and watched some tennis for awhile in evening.
18/6/19Ditto. Visited hospital in evening.
19/6/19In afternoon the nurses came to afternoon tea and dinner and at night we had a fine &  enjoyable dance.
