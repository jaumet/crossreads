All carried digging Tools as well as fight order. Each man did his 3 paces & went down 6’ = 2 shovel lengths & Width to suit himself. It was 12 mid night when we started & at 3 a.m. we had buried another 5 pu cable as before. The march home was a trial alright. I could have slept anywhere in spite of danger. Hot tea helped a lot about 5 a.m. when we reached Bivouac Camp. Transferred to #9
