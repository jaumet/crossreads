  
 Saturday 22 July 1916 In the same trenches, but busy during the day going round the front lines & communications to be sure of their positions, access &c. Terrific bombardment of Posieres by our guns & mortars during the afternoon. We got our orders of attack at this time & then had to make everything clear to the sergeants & section commanders who in turn passed the information on to their men. To this knowledge that every man had of what was expected of him in the attack, I largely attribute the ultimate success of the venture. The attack on Posieres is described on loose pages.
