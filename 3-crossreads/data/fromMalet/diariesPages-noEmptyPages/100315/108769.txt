signal wires soon went. McCartin very bravely faced death and hopped out with a little band of signallers and runners and tried to get a lamp going. This was impossible a/c smoke and fog. He then repaired the wires and got me into touch with the firing line. The Hun did not hop over. Until 7.30 all wires to Bde. were down and the General the rang me up to ask if all O.K. We had a rough house round here and many shells burst within inches. Some men wounded ? one 23rd killed. The barraging was mostly on roads and tracks and continued until noon. Yesterday I suspended Capt. Lanyon for unsatisfactory work. Today I recommended Bubsie McCartin for M.C.
