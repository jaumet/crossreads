 all line up along the road , there must have been hundr they were all French there were a lot of color troop with them , one for each bus to help the driver they come from Madagascar were not at all bad look , they all had bonzer warm fur coat on made from goat skin I think , they look veri comic but I ll bet they were warm for they reach near to their shin . After a bit of manouv 30 odd men were told off for each one of these black led each parti to the motor , they seem veri pleas as they led the boy down , it seem to be a regular thing with the French to run their troop to the fire line for these buse were fit up for the purpos seat , rifl rack all , they shift the whole Brigad at one stroke in this fashion someth like 4 or 5000 men
