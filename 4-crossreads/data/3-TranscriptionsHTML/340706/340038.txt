<p>84<br/>daubs contain no merit &amp; would look better at 10 miles than 10 paces. One picture in particular struck my eye a park scene with a couple of ladies seated on a seat &amp; a little girl in the foreward</p>
<p>Thence we went to Club for afternoon tea &amp; then took 16 tram to Bon Secours &amp; visited its church a magnificent structure without though oppressive within &amp; filled with a wonderful style of glass window. They contain [indecipherable] figures &amp; those small &amp; yet the colour effect is magnificent.</p>
<p>Then we went on to Joan of Arc memorial whence a view for miles up &amp; down the river &amp; away in the distance miles away look the green &amp; verdant pastures of Normandie. The visit was worth the vista &amp; I think I shall go there again.</p>
<p>Thence we retraced our steps Mansell nursing a French baby in the tram &amp; I holding on my knee my other friend an artillery officer about 6 ft high We dined at Club (4 fr) &amp; then to Opera where Mm Carre was playing the main part in Madame Butterfly &ndash; the most powerful representation I have seen the singing &amp; the acting were marvellous &amp; I quite lost myself &ndash; Tears were in my eyes at times.</p>
<p>Then to Hotel de Paris for a deep draught of the most delicious beer in town &amp; then the long walk home</p>
