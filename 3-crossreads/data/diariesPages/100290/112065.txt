The heavy rain of yesterday afternoon, floods our dugout play slips on the floor. Oh? the joys of winter camp aignising? Land slips, side of dugout falls in half burying me after we get to bed. Later in night ground sheet which we rigged up over head to catch drips, collapsed with weight of water drenched us. we still slept on or tried to woke apparently none the worse except for discomfort. Orders to move into the line at 9.30 a.m. Hurried pack up of wet clothes amp fall in breakfast. Move off travel about 2 or 3 miles farther up to the front line pitch our packs in another mud area which is to be our base. 40 in on big tent.
