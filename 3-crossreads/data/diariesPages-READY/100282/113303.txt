there were stretchers Red Cross cars all over the place, we had 4 casualities in our Battalion, one bomb dropped almost on the dump about 40 yards from our huts, caught the chaps who were at the latrines, also killed 2 tommies, so much for drilling in sight of the planes in the "forward area" this might teach those in authority a lesson but I doubt it. They are holding a voluntary R.C. C. of E. parade this morning.
This afternoon I found out where the 12th Battalion were camped, over in Ypres in the Belgian Barracks, so I went over to see Stan, strange to say I had a dread of enquiring for him, something seemed to tell me that I would hear bad news, I was not very far out, you can imagine what kind of a shock I got when they told me he had been killed, the world seemed to stand still for a few secs, I nearly fell, but I recovered my balance forced myself to keep quiet. George Vaughan must have heard someone enquiring
