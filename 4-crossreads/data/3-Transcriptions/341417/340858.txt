<p>with short scrub and undergrowth. Had several narrow shaves from bullets lobbing up against me while digging cover with entrenching tool, &ndash; our chaps on the right of the position have had to retire at times from part of the trenches on the right, but have always reoccupied them with a bayonet charge. The Turkish artillery is pouring schrapnel into us all the time &ndash; some more transports with an escort of warships arrived this morning (we can see all the boats below from our position high up on the hills about a mile and a half from the beach).<br/>Our aeroplanes go out scouting every day &ndash; fighting on our right very stiff &ndash; one of our mine trawlers sunk on the beach by the enemy's shells.

<p>29/4/15.  Still in same trenches &ndash; enemy's schrapnel still going strong and the shells from our ships and artillery below whiz close over our heads on top of the hill on its way to the Turks' positions beyond &ndash; some of it comes uncomfortably close &ndash; got relieved about 7 p.m. and went down the hill about a hundred yards below for a sleep, having had only a few dozes in the trenches since we landed &ndash; find our Company has lost a good</p>
