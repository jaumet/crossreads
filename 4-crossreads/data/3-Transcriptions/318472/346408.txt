<p>2 July 1918<br/>Tuesday<br/>Things quiet for me today as I haven't had any Draft men to handle. Things just going along in the same old Slow way in the Depot.</p>
<p>1918 July 3<br/>Wednesday<br/>Nothing of much account to report in the Depot. Nice fine weather. I haven't had any men to put through for Draft during the past two days so I have had a fairly Lazy time</p>
