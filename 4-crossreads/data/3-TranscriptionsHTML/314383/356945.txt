<p>wanted me to go up and take charge but was too ill &amp;  when I went for a walk I fainted after doing 500 yds.  The missionaries (God bless them) especially Dr &amp; Mrs. Funk did all they could for me &amp; at last I persuaded the officials to let me take the chance on the run thro to Baghdad, which they did.  Leaving Hamadan at 6 am we pushed on until dark &amp; then camped out in the blue.  My temp went up once more &amp; next day I was exhausted on reaching Kermansbah where I was in bed for 4 days, then another stretch to Pia Tak, then Karnekan and Ruz where I anchored for 3 days &amp; had real bread &amp; jam.  Then a night's run on the train to Baghdad where I spent three weeks then on to Amara by boat where I stayed 4 days, then Batoun Amarah where I stayed a fortnight.  Then by boat to Bombay.  God alone knows what privations, hardship &amp; horrors we endured on this stunt.  Scott- Olsen got his M.C. Murphy a bar to his O.C.M. Nimmo a O.C.R. &amp;  Casey a M.M. while Moore the cur got on to Baghdad as soon as possible after our arrival at Bijah &amp; wrote his report in such a way as if he did the whole show and did not recommend one of those I told him to.</p>
<p>I am feeling much better now however</p>
