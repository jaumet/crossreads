<p>20th May 1916</p>
<p>My dear Justice Ferguson,</p>
<p>I am sure it will please you beyond measure and all of your family to know, and I am quite certain it is my duty to tell you, that your son acted in a particularly gallant way on the night of the 5th instant in the command of his Company during a determined hostile attack upon the position he was then holding, and it has been my extreme pleasure to bring his conduct under the notice of higher authority.</p>
<p>I am not at liberty at present to give you any details, owing to the strictness of our censorship regulations, but no doubt you will be placed in the possession of them all in good time.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say he is a fearless gallant boy, and I am proud to have him under my command.</p>
<p>With kindest regards and best wishes,</p>
<p>Your sincerely,<br/>William Holmes<br/>Brig. Genl.<br/>(commanding 5th Brigade.)</p>
