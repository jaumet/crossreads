My dear Mrs Koch,Many thanks for Telegram with good wishes for my birthday. I had 30 here for Tea that day & we spent a very pleasant evening. Hope you are all keeping well. If all's well I hope to see you soon as [indecipherable] & I intend to spend a few week's in Sydney in July, Fred promised this trip as we did not get over for Easter. Am sending Mr Koch a p.c. for his birthday. Hoping to hear from you very soon & with love to Mr Koch, Friend & your own dear self. Yours with love. Sophie.
