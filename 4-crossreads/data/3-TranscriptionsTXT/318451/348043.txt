Wednesday 13th Dec. 1916Visited Billets this morning.Dull, cold.  We had a Bible Class here tonight about 7 of us, but it will grow.  We took the parable of the Sower & some very interesting thoughts were presented.We are expecting a bombardment of the town.
Thursday 14Raining.  Went to Hospital this morning.  Made arrangements also for place to hold service for Sunday.I had a funeral also, an Englishman of the Northumberland Fusiliers, Pt. J.H. Rukin.This afternoon I rode to Steenwerck to see the representative of the Comforts fund re supplies.  They have not yet come to hand.  Difficulties being the carriage & transport.It was about 7 miles over very bad roads.  Our guns bombarded the enemy.  This afternoon at 6 oclock we were expecting them to reply & shell the Town but so far nothing has come.  This morning's paper (13th) contained the offers of peace from Germany but I am confident nothing will come of it.
