  
 19 May, 1916 Romanai [Romani] We have been having a quiet time of it since we arrived back from the stunt on Tuesday.  Each day we saddled up in the morning at about eight oclock & came over & tied our horses up in the shade of the palms.  It is a beautiful day to day very different from Tuesday  - In a tent at the Field Amb it was 127&degrees; & in the Brigs tent it was 123 - I would like to know what it was out in the desert where we were.  The 1st LH arrived here yesterday & I saw Hartnett & Rutherford had a long yarn with them last night
