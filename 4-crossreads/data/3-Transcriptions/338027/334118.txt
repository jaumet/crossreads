<p>The inquiry into the death of the horse was held in the morning &amp; a verdict of misadventure was resolved.</p>
<p>We all put down fresh horse lines to-day as the old ones were nearly all pulled out of the ground.</p>
<p>The surprise of the year was a pretty ceremony at night it was the marriage of one of our most popular officers Capt. Fowler.  His bride has come all the way from Aust. &amp; only arrived a few days ago.  After the ceremony the happy couple went to Shepheard's Hotel.  We had no rice so we threw the next best thing &ndash; horse barley.  The men were all invited to drink their health.</p>
<p>Burial to-day of the accident.  More court-martials this morning.  The two corporal cooks were charged with drunkenness but escaped with a severe reprimand.  The S.M. had two paltry cases but both were dismissed.  It is his doings that are causing all the dissatisfaction amongst the men.</p>
<p>Whilst one of our hospital waggons was returning from the hospital it was attacked by natives with stones but no damage was done.  Mail day received a letter from Mother dated Dec 11th.  Pay night also, as my increment does not start until 1st Jan I had to get an advance from the Colonel.</p>
