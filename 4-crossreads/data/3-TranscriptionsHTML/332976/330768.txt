<p>December 1916<br/>a considerable number of casualties.<br/>18th   I have been on the same work in Needle trench since the 13th &amp; have also built a machine-gun position for purpose of defence against aeroplanes which are numerous &amp; at times fly very low.  We have been shelled heavily most of the time &amp; have had a fair casualty list.<br/>(Fritz shelling seems to be concentrated on the "solitary tree" about a hundred yds in rear of us for the past 4 or 5 days.  The duckwalk track which leads past it has suffered a few direct hits.</p>
