<p>Joe dear:/ 4-3-15. 10p.m.: A letter came from you today.  It was delivered to me about 1 p.m.  Many thanks for it.  The heading is "219 Macquarie St., City, 15-1-15., the journey therefore occupied about seven weeks.  The address on the envelope "Lieut Col J. B. Nash, (S.S. Kyarra), No. 2 Gen Hospital, A.A.M.C., c/o War Contingents Association, 72 Victoria St., S.W." Some one had placed a printed slip, over the end words of your address, on which was from c/o to W.  Printed on the left hand end of the slip you will see a reference from The Agent General.  A very round about way truly, just shouldering the responsibility to the soldiers of Some one else.  "Via America" at top of the envelope is somewhat mistifying.  The course was not apparently by the U.S.A.</p>
<p>It is good of Mr Moroney to call to see you, but rather shabby of you to make use of him to take a letter to the post.</p>
<p>Nan, no doubt had a pleasant holiday with you.</p>
<p>Dear Buddie has not sent me a letter for some time, mayhap one is seeking me somewhere between West Maitland and Sydney.  I hope that the change to Moss Vale has given her store of mental and physical strength that will stand her in good stead for her teaching duties during the whole of A.D. 1915.</p>
<p>The two sisters would have appreciated the visit to Sydney's busy town.  What a contrast to the quiet within the Conventual walls.</p>
<p>Maria would have enjoyed the chats with May at Santa Sabina.  My love to both.</p>
<p>L. A. B. Wade has done some good work for the irrigation settlements.  R.I.P.  It is to be hoped that a capable man will get his position.  The work to do is of great importance for the country.</p>
<p>You will have seen before now in the illustrated papers pictures about the earthquake disasters in the land of the Aboruzi [Avezzano earthquake, Abruzzo], Italy.  Had it not been for the war they would have loomed large on the mental horizon of civilised people, but before the magnitude of the great war, such events pale</p>
