<p>We could not find out were they intended taking us.<br/>Otherwise the second day passed in the same way as the first.</p>
<p>14th October 1914<br/>Today we were told that we would be taken to Penang and there most likely, be placed in a german club or else in a hotel. About 10 a.m. the French gun boat "Biberville" passed us . Both ships stopped. I won't write anything about this "Onion box" lest this book should fall into English hands. "Biberville" was to take "Pontoporos" to Penang whereas "Yarmouth" should try and reach Penang at full speed, probably to get rid of us as soon as possible. "Yarmouth" was now running 13-14 knots and soon "Biberville" and "Pontoporos" were out of sight.</p>
