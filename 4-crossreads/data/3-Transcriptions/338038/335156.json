<p>III<br/>all snugly quartered.<br/>The new gun which I mentioned last week, and of which I have been given command is an anti-aircraft &ndash; Quite a modern piece &ndash; and the first one landed here. The Turk has been getting very bold with his aerial reconnaissance, and often flies very low over our positions, so that the next time he comes along I hope to give him a warm reception, having just completed mounting the gun today. It is quite a common sight to see a "Taube" (German) up over the position and one of our own planes as well but they are mostly scouts and not armed, so that we have not yet seen a "duel in the air" of which we hear so much on the Continent.<br/>The last few days have demonstrated to us that we shall need our warm clothing for the coming months. A strong wind set in from the North, with slight showers of rain, but so long as one can move about a little, this weather is preferable to the heat we have recently experienced.<br/>III</p>
