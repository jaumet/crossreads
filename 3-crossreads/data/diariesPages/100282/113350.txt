very interesting at times hilly, we had several splendid panomoric views of the surrounding country, once just as we got abreast of Desvres the scene was very fine, as far as you could see towards the West, the land rolled away like gigantic billows the sides all covered with green growing crops grass, scattered all over the place were clumps of trees, while at your feet lay the busy town with its tall factory chimneys with smoke curling slowly upwards, from here the road lead gradually along a pretty ridge but ever climbing, climbing at last we reached the summit a splendid view was unfolded, we were on a high hill, the highest anywhere about away below us lay a beautiful fertile valley on the opposite slope lay a fair sized town a white road stretching for miles, the boys all gasped when they saw this, these never ending roads are not the nicest things to have in front of you.
