<p>The Wireless Engineer estimates that it would take four months to erect iron towers. Lieut. Bond reports three of his men wounded, whom I am sending down to beach for transport to Ship. My men are somewhat exhausted and I shall require provisions and water today. I shall send what provisions and water I have to the W/T Station at daylight and await your instructions as to whether I am still to hold the station. I have received a communication from Colonel Watson which states that he will junction with me on the Kaba Kaul road, leaving his present position at Herbertshohe at 5-0 a.m. today. One of the wounded above referred to has succumbed (time 2-45am).</p>
