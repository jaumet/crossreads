<p>am going to treat as a rumour, not an order.</p>
<p>When I get on the move, I'll come to the conclusion that I have started on my trip Home, but not until then.</p>
<p>Mar 12th &ndash; 19<br/>At last, at last, at last and at last we have left Morialme and have started on our way Home</p>
<p>Somehow or other it is very hard to realise but I suppose we will "compre" (understand) in time.</p>
<p>Well we arrived at Presles a dirtier and quieter villiage it would be hard to find in Belgium.</p>
<p>We had a great send off</p>
