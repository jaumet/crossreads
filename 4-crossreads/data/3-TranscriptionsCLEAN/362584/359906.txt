 My dear Mother 
 In posting my last letter to you, I forgot to enclose these photos. The post card was taken on board the Havenford on our way over. I'm sitting on the left of Col. Lloyd. I was in the same ward & in the next bed to him while I was in hospital. The other photo is the battalion officers taken in France.
