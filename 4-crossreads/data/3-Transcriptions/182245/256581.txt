<p>7 WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>Fine but very cold &amp; windy. One</p>
<p>of the coldest days we have</p>
<p>had I think. I was boiling</p>
<p>Peas for the horses all</p>
<p>morning &amp; we had a</p>
<p>gas lecture in afternoon</p>
<p>They say we may get gas</p>
<p>anytime this month as</p>
<p>its nearly always windy</p>
