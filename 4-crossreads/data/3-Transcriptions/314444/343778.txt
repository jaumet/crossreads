<p>I have been to several French classes, and on Sundays lots of French folk come to the camp, so we are able to practice. Am getting along O.K. and when on leave go to visit one family who have a beautiful place right on the Atlantic shore.</p>
<p>The Rev. Gordon Hirst is in camp, and I will see him one of these days. I thought at first it was not him, but George Duddle met him later. This is a great place to meet home boys, as they all go through here when joining or going back to their battalions. The Fourth of July is to be a great day. All the French</p>
