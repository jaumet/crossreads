I have not made a copy of this letter it does not seem worth sending to the girls, it is, more a personal letter to you. I'm afraid not a very interesting one. I must go to bed now at 11 pm 8th Feb 1916. Dearest Constance's birthday day after tomorrow. I shall be thinking of her. I hope she has a happy day. I am very glad to think of her having had a trip to Tasmania and hope she will have had an entertaining time and come home strong. Give Bob Owen my love if you see him. I wish he'd been here very much love to Edith & Willie & the children - & Ernest. thank him for the paper about Bob. it was splendid to hear about him. I know his men worship him. Love to Constance & her darlings - & Cousin Lily & Percy.I think much about Grandmother these days. I love her so dearly - she is a great inspiration to me to look upward. & forward - in faith - sweet, beautiful
