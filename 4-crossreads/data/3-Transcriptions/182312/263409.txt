<p>on the rails or climbing out into the boats which latter by the way</p>
<p>were kept hung out in the davits and lowered half way to the water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No submarines were seen but the &quot;Minneapolis&quot; a vessel of our own</p>
<p>size and only one day ahead of us was sunk; fortunately she had no</p>
<p>troops on board at the time.&nbsp; In our efforts to avoid submarine</p>
<p>attacks we dodged all over the place, never keeping on the same</p>
<p>course for more than three minutes, the idea being that it takes</p>
<p>a submarine commander fully three or four minutes to work up his</p>
<p>aim for his torpedo ( he has to take into consideration the speed,</p>
<p>course and length of the target ship, also the speed of his own</p>
<p>craft and the general condition of the sea way)&nbsp; and by that time</p>
<p>the target has changed her course and he as to start working up</p>
<p>another aim.&nbsp; He may of course take a chance shot, but unless he is</p>
<p>within very close range he is hardly likely to do this for fear</p>
<p>of being strafed by Von Tirpitz for wasting torpedoes which cost</p>
<p>about &pound;800 each.&nbsp; Ofter six or seven big vessels would be within our</p>
<p>field of vision at the same time and it was a most peculiar sight to</p>
<p>see them wandering about as though playing blind man&#39;s bluff.&nbsp; They</p>
<p>may all be bound for different destinations and yet they appear to be</p>
<p>all mixed up, and it is impossible to tell which one is going in your</p>
<p>own direction and which the opposite.&nbsp; The anount&nbsp; of extra mileage</p>
<p>steamed must be enormous.&nbsp; Suddenly a destroyer will hop up over the</p>
<p>horizon, dash up to each ship, satisfy herself as to her identity</p>
<p>and then spin round on her tail and be out of sight within very few</p>
<p>minutes.&nbsp; There seems to be a never ending supply of these craft and</p>
<p>often we were visited by half a dozen different ones during the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They never stop but tear up at somewhere between 20 and 30 knots,</p>
<p>have a close look at you and then turn so quickly that they look as</p>
