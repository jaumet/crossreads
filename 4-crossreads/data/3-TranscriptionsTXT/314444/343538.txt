 France June 28th 1917. 
 My dear Mr Ellis, 
 I have only today learned, through official channels of the death of your son, No 1114 Pte. Arthur Raymond Ellis, and I hasten to express my very sincere regret. Your son left us on May 12th I am informed that he died of Anaemia at the No 32 Stationary Hospital on June 7th. His body was buried in the Wimereux Cemetery. 
 Your son was always a most reliable soldier, and carried out his duties in a willing and cheerful manner. I can speak only in the highest terms of his character, &amp; of his conduct during the whole time he was with the Battalion. We all mourn his death. 
 Officers, non-commissioned-officers &amp; men all join me in offering you &amp; your family most heartfelt sympathy in your sad bereavement. 
 Yours very sincerely, Leslie J. Morshead. Lieut-Colonel.
