<p>6 September 1915<br/>Monday 46 wks from home</p>
<p>Spent another quiet night along the whole front only a little fire occasionally.  A monitor shelled 971 with her 4" guns then later the gunboats gave Walkers Ridge a dose.  Went round to pay Eric another visit but found that he had moved off with his Bn to Browns Dip &amp; relieved the R I Rifles who are now in Rest. Gully.  The enemy shelled us &amp; the lines of transport all day with every shell &amp; make at their disposal but they only succeeded in getting 4 mules, even the bathing parties got a share of it.  Gun outpost came in contact with 12 men under a sergt last night in front of our lines they had been sent out to get a sniper but the sniper has got 5 of them instead.  Mail came in last night we expect to see it tomorrow.  Everyone busily employed in making winter quarters for themselves at present   Sig office &amp; Bde office nearly finished.  Two more piers are being built opp the Sphinx &amp; a huge store is being made inland probably as a base for the winter</p>
<p>7 September 1915<br/>Tuesday</p>
<p>Save for a miniature attack on Camel Hump later last night things were only quiet, away on the left the ninth army corps had a successful demonstration.  The Turks at daybreak gave us the usual shelling &amp; the 60 pounders got hell for an hour or so, Indian transports also came in for a grilling &amp; several men were hit, later when Bill &amp; I went for water one showered us &amp; one penetrated his shirt. Fritz was over in a brand new machine &amp; had a shot or two with his bombs but nothing doing.  Our new home is looking something like an encampment.  Ships at Suvla keep us supplied with [indecipherable] bursting shells.  Remodelled the lines of C both tele &amp; Cable &amp; saved a few hundred ft of wire.  Fatigue parties still burying the enemy's dead.  Both [indecipherable] &amp; Jack are wounded , J Ellesley is killed.  Our 60 pounders have been pumping in shell for all they are worth &amp; as they kick up a cloud of dust at every shot they attract plenty of whistlers from Turkey Canteen Stores arrive</p>
