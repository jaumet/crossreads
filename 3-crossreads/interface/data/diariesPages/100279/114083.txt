Our Battn came out on the 6th we finished up in one of the Bazentin Camps after marching a mile or so out of our track.
I carried a great big shell round with me which must have weighed 14 or 15 lbs she was a walloper. 
We left Bazentin early next morning pulled up at our old Camp at Fricourt, where we are at present.
