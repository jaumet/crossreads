 30-11-16 Thurs 30th At 6 oclock this morning I went to the Central Helio station to see the Outpost stations were properly posted &amp; to get their report. Roger objected to going out so early without company &amp; gave a good exhibition of rooting. The day before yesterday our secret service agent (a Bedouin) went out through our lines to pay the enemy a visit &amp; bring back information, he proved a good friend before the battle of Romani, bringing in news of just what was going to happen:  I am having a very easy time here &amp; do just what pleases me &amp; have no parades at all to attend.
