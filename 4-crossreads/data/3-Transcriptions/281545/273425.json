<p>I received a splendid Hot Dinner in the Sergeants Mess, I then laid down &amp; read for a while then turned in at 8 Pm &amp; slept like a top all night.</p>
<p>Friday 8th.   I signed on again at 8.30 for another run to Bethune in glorius weather &amp; after an uneventful run arrived there on time at 10.44 am &amp; with two other chums we went for a walk up the Town until Lunch time, passing through one street &amp; another, &amp; eventually arrived back to the Y.M.C.A. Hut for Lunch &amp; after a cup of tea we made for the Station &amp;  awaited the departure of the return train.   I took up my usual position on the Eng at 1.37 Pm off we went, at nearly every station enroute a large number of Parcels were put in for French Prisoners of War in Germany at some stations there were 2 &amp; 3 Barrowfull's, at one station Berguette a number of German Prisoners detrained for St Omer, they had entrained at two stations further back.   They all looked well &amp; appeared Happy to be out of the struggle, we arrived at Hazebruick a few minutes late &amp; after a while we arrived back at the Depot, &amp; after I had Dinner I played Crib until bed time &amp; then turned in.   Saturday's run was uneventful going &amp; coming with the exception of having to shunt the Passenger</p>
