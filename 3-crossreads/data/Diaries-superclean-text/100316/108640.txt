at a chalk pit only 1200" behind the front line. The ridge hid all our movement and there was no shelling. It is the first time that I have ever been able to ride up to the H.Q. of a line Bn. in daylight anywhere let alone on a front as touchy as this. Saw H. Crowther who is well. Their losses seem to have been light though heard with great regret of the death of Colonel McConachy who was with me at Flixecourt such a little while ago. We now rode over to Daours leaving Corbie right behind us and there we saw a crowd of civilian kiddies where a few families still hang on. The day was hot and everyone was feeling tired as we rode back into Pont Noyelles. After a late lunch I did odd jobs and listened to our Band playing ? promoting the Sergt to full rank on the spot. Later on Leon Barbier came in for a yarn and to stay to mess with us. After mess I went up to Bde H.Q. again to attend another conference provided over by the General. He read an order from General Birdwood about our chaps disparaging the Tommies but orders will not stop it. The other three CO's were also present here. Hun planes were over and dropping many bombs. A satisfactory method of dealing with air raids has yet to be devised. To make great play with searchlights and to frantically loose off many rounds of high explosive and shrapnel is to only play with the matter.
