<p><strike>Thurs 22</strike> Wed. 21-6-'16<br/>marching close to hedges at about 30 paces interval. We passed thru a mined village (Pictures recalled London Illust. &amp; Cinema). One corner, where was an old Church in ruins, we came under fire from M. Gun Traversing.  Bulletts whissed overhead nearly all the way &amp; buried themselves in the road all around. It was dark when we came behind the firing line about 1000 yds. From the Huns. Flares lit up the snakelike formation of <br/>the fatigue party = 100 or more men of all regiments. We halted at 3 paces interval &amp; then I noticed that we formed a line from our own front line back.</p>
