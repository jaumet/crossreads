 little destroyer has arrived to convoy us and is now bouncing from one side to the other before our bows with waves dashing all over her. Passing to the north of Crete all day not far off the land. The coast looks very weird and barren .Various rocks and islands here and there. We are now travelling what is known as "B" route and are in touch with Malta by wireless. Lot of steamers about. Crete still to our left when I fell asleep on deck tonight
