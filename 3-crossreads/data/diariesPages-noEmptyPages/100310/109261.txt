10/8/17 Campagne St. Omer
Feeling tired did not get up until later than usual and let matters carry on. Rode into St Omer with Murphy as orderly passing through Arques. Between Arques and St Omer the country is very pretty intensely cultivated. The ground is flat and much diversified with woods and crops. (Yesterday again noticed "the Pyramids"two big piles of stock at some distant mines). Left horses at Hotel de France in St Omer and went up saw R.T.O. Returned and had a walk in the gardens which are very fine and well laid out. There were a good many soldiers civilians here and many kids playing about. Some of the St Omer streets down towards St Bertin are very old and full of quaint looking houses. A lot of people as usual are in black. There is one class of Frenchman eminently unhealthy looking ? puffy faced and sometimes I suspect even powdered. Usually has a M'selle in tow so prowess in love cannot not be judged on mere outward physical appearance it seems. All the gardens here are most delightfully green.
