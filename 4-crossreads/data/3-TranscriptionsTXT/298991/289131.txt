 Thursday January 4th 1917 Paraded to Major Bently to see if I could be taken on to Ribemont by motor, as my feet are still very sore, (successful). Left Cardonette about 8.45 am &amp; arrived at Ribemont at 10 am. It was raining coming along, &amp; was very cold. We are again billeted in one of the store rooms of the flower mill here, but I only have one flight of stairs to climb now. Feeling out of sorts all day. 
 Friday January 5th 1917 A fine day all day. On water fatigue, only had two water carts to fill. We had to pump the water out of a well, so it didn't take long to fill a cart. There are plenty of German prisoners working in this town, they are chiefly employed sweeping the mud &amp; slush off the roads, also general maintenance of same. Went for a bath in the afternoon to the Corps Baths at Healey, (about two miles away) but as the water was either too hot or too cold I came back nearly as dirty as I went, anyhow I got as exchange of clothes. Trying to get a position as motor car orderly on one of the ambulance cars. 
 Saturday January 6th Went up to Brigade dump this morning to guard our things we dumped befor leaving for Vignacourt. As all the things were shifted by two oclock, this evening we came back again. Saw Bill Freeman &amp; Clive Dwyer in the afternoon. To break the monotony I went with a couple of others to a vaudeville show here, it was very good &amp; we had quite an enjoyable evening. The performers were out of the Tommy Army Service Corps. Some are professionals I think.
