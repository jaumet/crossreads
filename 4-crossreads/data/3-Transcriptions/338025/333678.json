<p>Friday 4th may 1917<br/>Reveille 7am<br/>No parade till 9am as we have no Donks to feed.<br/>Went to Doctor this morning. Exempt from duty, so spent the day writing letters.<br/>Just on lights out (9,30pm) a Taube flew over our camp (very low). It was flying about for nearly 5 minutes and in that time dropped three bombs. It again came towards our camp, so we got out of the camp. Did not drop any more bombs, as our Anti-aircraft guns opened out on it also some of the boys with rifles.</p>
