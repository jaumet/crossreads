<p>P.S.<br/>Uncle Harry has to work very hard &amp; has long hours, &amp; He must find it very hard to write, but He is going to strain a point &amp; is really sorry that He neglected to answer your last 2 letters.  We read a letter of yours to Aunt Annie 3 days after she had received it, strange wasn't it.</p>
