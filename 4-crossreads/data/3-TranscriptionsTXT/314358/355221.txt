 Tell my mother I never forget her 
 She is with me so often here, her splendid Hope and trust is mine, and worth more than all the commissions under the sun. "Rank is but the guinea stamp" &ndash; as Bobby Burns puts it. 
 Dont take my notes as finished writings for I have no time to write as I am able to. 
 Much love to you my wife and to our children and mother. 
 Not forgetting the others 
 Am glad mother has grand old Jack still at home.
