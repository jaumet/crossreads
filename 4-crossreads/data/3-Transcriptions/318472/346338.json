<p>23 April 1918<br/>Tuesday<br/>Just jogging along in the same old way. Nice warm weather continues and every where is beginning to look beautiful and green.</p>
<p>1918 April 24<br/>Wednesday<br/>Nothing of importance to note. Just the same old camp life. Things are still going against us on the Western Front particularly in the Northern sector.</p>
