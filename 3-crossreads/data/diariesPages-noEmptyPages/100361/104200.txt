Thur. Jan 10.
Went to see Lizzie and Joe. Had dinner there. Returned to Ferris Farm. Then caught Train for London. Ruth saw me off at the Station.
Fri. 11
Last night slept at War Chest Club. Furlough ended. Caught Train at Paddington at 12.20 came away to Sutton Veny on the famous Salisbury Plains. After fooling around for a time, we were told off to different Huts. I was jolly tired and slept soundly, though it was on the hard floor.
Sat. 12
Bugle blew at 7. How pleasant(?) it sounded. Hopped out of Bed, rushed over to "Ablution" Place and washed under the Tap. It is jolly rough, after being used to Mable or Mrs Harvey to bring me hot water.
 Wrote Letter 1 to M.S. 
Sun. 13
Snowed heavily all night and it lies about 6 inches deep. We were all lined up for classification. There must have been nearly a thousand men on Parade. Someone threw a snowball, and that started the Fun. If an officer put in an appearance he was bombarded from all quarters. It got so hot that they marched ?em away out of the Road. I was exempt from the Route March as I was inoculated last Sat..
Mon 14
Up for classification again. After a few hours waiting about in the cold, we eventually got inside. Maj. MacKenzie passed me and marked me the same as I was on Sat. B.1.A.2. At night he sent for me. So I went up to his quarters, where I stayed to Supper and had a good old yarn.
