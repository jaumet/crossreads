Villers-Bretonneux
The morning broke a fine sunny one and I found that I was in grip of the prevailing diarrhoea, which in many cases, is turning to dysentery. The sky soon clouded up and rain commenced. A couple of 21st were killed last night and their bodies brought down for burial. Laid down and rested until after lunch. During the afternoon received detailed orders for the projected attack and thereupon commenced to make all arrangements. All the Company Commanders came to Bn. H.Q. at 6.30 p.m. and went into the scheme with me. The supply of rations tomorrow night is going to be difficult. Q. matters discussed with Burrage. Salmon Mallinson came up with Harricks tonight. Sutherland went back to Transport.
