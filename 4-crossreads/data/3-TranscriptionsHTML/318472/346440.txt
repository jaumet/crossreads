<p>3 August 1918<br/>Saturday<br/>A very quiet uneventful day. The weather continues to be very hot making things very uncomfortable. No news of any kind through.</p>
<p>1918 August 4<br/>Friday<br/>Cloudy &amp; squally with a choppy sea &amp; a fairly heavy swell. Church Parade in the morning &amp; nothing else of much importance. Expect to get Sierra Leone tomorrow</p>
