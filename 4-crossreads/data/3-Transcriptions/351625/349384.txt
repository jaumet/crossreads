<p>to drink a toast tho for a quick return to Australia, dont think I got drunk because I dont every do that.  News came through here at about 11 oclock on Monday morning 11th.  At 2 oclock there was a speech at the town Hall &amp; every one joined in a procession round the streets finishing up with a short thanksgiving service after which the boys all went out with there best girls, they were coming home at all hours of the night.  I believe they are still keeping up rejoicings today, all shops shut etc.  I suppose they had great doings in Sydney too but the excitement there will come when the boys come home.  Give my love to all &amp; whips for yourself &amp; dad.</p>
