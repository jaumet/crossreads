<p>26-12-16<br/>fall &amp; we got the order to double &amp; the strongest runner got home first &amp; there was no dismiss; it was a rough ending to a rough parade: Found out this morning that C Sqdn Sigs brought back a Turkish Field 'Phone &amp; 5 reels of light wire with them on the pack horse. Made some improvements on our "Bivy" this afternoon as it has been showery &amp; looks like heavy rain tonight.</p>
<p>27-12-16<br/>Wed 27th<br/>Had some heavy rain last night &amp; early this morning but managed to keep fairly dry. Went for a ride down to the pier this afternoon with Lindsell to give our horses some exercise</p>
