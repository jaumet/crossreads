11th Had a good sleep a fine bed last night we were very tired, but a good wash fixed us up, had all our shortages taken then went down to the sitting room attached to the "Sergts Mess" a Sergt over here is someone I can tell you they live like fighting cocks, their "lounge" is a bonzer room all plush leather seats lounges, beautiful carpets on the floor fine pictures on the walls plenty of small tables flowers regimental
