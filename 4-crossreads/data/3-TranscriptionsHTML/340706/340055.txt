<p>the Peace de la Republique once occupied by a bastion of the old fortifications swept away by Louis XIV &amp; now embellished with a stature of the Republic with three figures Liberty Equality &amp; Fraternity</p>
<p>Thence I turned into The Boulevards &ndash; by streets but hardly sufficient to accommodate the crowds that throng it Passing the Porte St Martin &amp; then Porte St Denis &ndash; the latter as dear to my memory from the song &amp; then on through the fashionable Boul de Italiens to Place de l'Opera.</p>
<p>At end of which stands the Opera House an enormous structure covering nearly 3 acres of ground &amp; costing for building alone &pound;1,460,000. On opposite side of square is a large hotel containing over 1,000 bedroom &ndash;</p>
<p>I then follow on the Boulevarde de la Madeline to the Madeline itself &ndash; a building in style of a Roman Temple intended for a Temple of Glory by Nap. 1 &ndash; it has no windows being lighted from above &amp; is built entirely of stone.</p>
<p>So far I have had no luncheon &amp; am becoming tired so proceed back to Hotel passing Palais Royal built by Richelien &amp; after occupied by Anne of Austria &amp; the birthplace of Louis XIV.</p>
<p>At Hotel, I take off my boots &amp; rest my feet &amp; find a big blister under one of my toes. After about &frac12; hour we set off for Montmartre via the Metropolitan passing Trocadero on our way. This my first experience of Paris Tube is much more to my taste</p>
