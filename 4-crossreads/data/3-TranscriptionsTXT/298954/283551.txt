Sat. 15th Dec.On Mon 3rd Dec. I entered hospital just before the "Wolf" rounded into the Atlantic on a N. Westerly course.    The doctor told me frankly that I had appendicitis, that there was not sufficient anaesthetic on board to operate, and that the only chance was complete starvation.
A couple of days later the white screens where brought out and they were told aft to prepare for another burial.
But I refused to die and am still pushing along although I have had nothing but a little ice since I entered hospital and am deplorably weak.    Webbie has been splendid;  he has come along to the hospital and when he came the patients (including self) got the first bath they had had for ages.
The German orderlies never wash anybody or anything.
Am semi-conscious most of the time being heavily "doped" with morphine and opium.
