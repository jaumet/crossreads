<p>Saturday 3 June 1916<br/>Route march out on to battlefield.  Tremendous big trenches out there.  Went out again in evening, had a good look through old trenches and gun mounds.</p>
<p>Sunday 4 June 1916<br/>No parade all day.  Felt pretty crook.  Think I am getting mumps.<br/>Dust storm in evening.  Everything left outside tents was burried by drifting sand.  Wrote to boys (2).  Got news of big sea fight.  Afraid we did not win very much.</p>
