&lt;p&gt;we will strive to attain that lofty plane of true amp; perfect Love. When I revisit the past twelve months my heart overflows in a paen of happy rejoicing. It has given me you, the gentlest, sweetest truest amp; best lassie man can be blest with. May I ever be worthy of my great possession. I&#39;ll write no day by day news this time dear. Will reserve till our next. Good night my love, may sweet sleep give you all his rest. Ever yours Chas. &lt;br/&gt;P.S. Mary arrived home safely yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
