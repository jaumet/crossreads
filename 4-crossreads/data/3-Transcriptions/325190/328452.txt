<p>fire in one of our biscuit tins (foot square tin boxes), &amp; the smoke it has created must surely rob it of its comfort: they seem quite happy however.<br/>The Tommy is philosophical.<br/>Yesterday evening in Rouen station I saw a truck packed full &amp; tight with them (some 60 or so), &amp; with the prospect of a night under such discomfort in view, they were not  pushing &amp; busting &amp; cursing as some of ours.  No! they sat quite still; some reading papers &amp; some just smoking, &amp; had such a philosophical &amp; resigned air that our boys could not help remarking on it.</p>
