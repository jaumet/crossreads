<p>&amp; left at 4-36 Pm &amp; after a good run arrived in Poperinghe at 6 Pm. After making inquiries at the Control about a Train to Regersberg, they informed me that none would leave for some time, I decided to walk if I could not get a lift anyhow after going along the road for about a mile along came a Motor Transport &amp; I climbed up behind.  The Driver said he was going to Eypres so I was alright for a lift.  The distance to Eypres is about 9 miles from Poperinghe, <strike>when</strike>.  The Transport was full of Boys going back to Camp &amp; after a somewhat rough ride I left the Lorry at the Reigersberg Railway Crossing &amp; in a few minutes was back in Camp.   I signed on at Midnight &amp; during the Night Snow &amp; sleet began to fall &amp; <strike>although I</strike> when I was relieved at 8 am everything was covered with snow to about 3" in thickness, to a New chum it looked a beautiful sight all the Tents, Huts &amp; Dug Outs covered over with snow. When the Sun rose it made everything Glitter several of our boys amused themselves with snow balling each other.</p>
<p>Christmas Day.  Dec 25/1917.   I laid down at 10am for a couple of hours rest &amp; was woke up at 12.30 Pm</p>
