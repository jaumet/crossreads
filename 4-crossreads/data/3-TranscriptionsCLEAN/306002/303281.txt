We are situated at present only five or six hundred yards from the sea, so we are handy for swimming & washing, directly below us is a strip of country 400 or 500 yds. wide  wide  which is in view of the enemy & a dispatch rider has to run the gauntlet from 2 to 3 times a day carrying important dispatches.  The Turks have snipers & sometimes machine guns turned on this part of the road in hopes of bringing down the horse or man, one man has been winged only, up to date, so it has hardly paid the Turk for his trouble.  I believe we are only here for 3 days & then go into the trenches, if we do I think we are likely to be put in some rough charges, as it is along here that we are forcing the fighting.
