<p>[Several coloured sketches by Vasco, with descriptive comment about each one. See image for details.]<br/>[Sketch of soldier with note book, standing on a snowy track and observing an aeroplane, two black birds by his feet. With comment:]<br/>Points of interest [arrow pointing to wings of aeroplane]<br/>First thing next morning.  How the aviator doesn't do a perish with the cold isn't explained.<br/>Rooks</p>
<p>[Sketch of an Australian soldier with his ears and hands covered by socks to keep warm, coming out of a "Troop Wash Places", located by an ice-topped sea wall with robins sitting on it and a lighthouse in the distance. With comment:]<br/>All the way from Liscard and Brixton<br/>Jan 30th 1917.<br/>After eleven weeks and three days on board the "Suevic" zigzagging to dodge tin fish via St. Helena and Sierra Leone with no shore leave since Durban and Cape Town I was on picquet and had the pleasure of seeing Eddystone Lighthouse once more.</p>
<p>[Sketch of a long line of soldiers marching through snow to barracks. With comment:]<br/>A day's train journey from Plymouth to Tidsworth. Hedges like the tracery in a church window. Rows and rows of chimney pots and backyards. Cold and gloomy <strike>ruins</strike> ivy covered ruins. Bleak and dismal. (Tell Jack never to budge an inch.) Presented with a bun (free) and a cup of tea by the Mayoress at Exeter. Reached our camp huts on Perham downs after a two mile march across country as dismal as the canadian Prairie. Salisbury Plains at midnight.</p>
<p>[Sketch of the inside of a hut with comment:]<br/>What time's reveille 6.30 !!!?<br/>our Boudoir and Breakfast Room.</p>
<p>Hut 19 accomodates thirty. Fourteen on one side to make room for a feeble stove. For all the world our studio might be <strike>the</strike> an undertakers workshop. Coffin sides are stacked alongside the wall and put together [plus] paliasses and blankets keep some of the cold out. The would be corpses rise from a certain death from freezing and reassert their circulatery equilibrium by vigorously pacing up and down the sixty foot enclosure.</p>
