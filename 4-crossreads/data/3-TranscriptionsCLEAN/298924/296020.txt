The Authorities are pandering to popular tastes in providing a surfeit of football, racing, boxing, etc.  Few realize the strenuous times ahead & one often hears the men growl, "What has the war done for me, etc. etc."  I get very disgusted at the heroes!!! Any written here for you Mother to burn after. Love from son.
