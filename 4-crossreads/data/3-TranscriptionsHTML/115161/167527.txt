<p>selfishness, they decided would so break up the &quot;happy&quot; home, that the step I contemplated taking would result in a despoiled home, a broken-hearted wife, and two sorrowful and deserted daughters.</p>
<p>The prospect was not a very pleasant one to contemplate. On one side the trio, on the other side hero-worship.</p>
<p>But let me say right here, that I&nbsp;fully thought (and I was not alone in this) that the whole job would be well over before I arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;fact that I contemplated enlisting became known to our few friends, resulting in congratulations to me for my loyalty and patriotic spirit, which I&nbsp;received in becoming (though to me unnantural) modesty. Little did they dream that I smiled inwardly at their congratulations, feeling so sure that the war would be over and that in truth I&nbsp;would be only going for a voyage at the expense of the Commonwealth. Had I thought for a moment that it could have been otherwise, well: the trio I expect would have gained the day.</p>
<p>Hero-worship and thoughts of the voyage and good times generally actuated by the fact that I&nbsp;would be receiving pay during all this&nbsp;time weighed with me to such an extent, that I threw in my vote with&nbsp;hero-worship, voyage and pay, thus securing a majority of one in favor of enlistment&nbsp;(if accepted). I therefore decided to enlist, but would wait for a convenient moment to do so.</p>
<p>The struggle at the front (according to the press) was getting blacker and blacker, and the whole problem forced itself upon me, that more men (I considered myself one) were required to turn the balance in favor of our little island off the coast of France. And so I&nbsp;finaly came to the conclusion that the day had arrived for me to take some&nbsp;active part in the great struggle, and so assist in freeing my beloved country from the toils in which she found herself.</p>
