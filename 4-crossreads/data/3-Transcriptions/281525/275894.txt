<p>17/10/17 Boulogne<br />Had a talk with the R.T.O and then returned to the hotel and a medium dinner. Caught the 9.5 train which was about half an hour late. You have to climb up into French trains as there are only platforms about 6 inches high. Travelled all night in the train and got a little broken rest sitting up. A compartment crowded with French officers and soldiers, hermetically sealed and all breathing &amp; puffing heavily.</p>
<p>18/10/17<br />Reached Paris about 7 a.m. and collared a taxi at once driving to the Elysee Palace Hotel in the Avenue des Champs Elysees. Asked the cocher the fare and he fired the usual jargon of French numbers at me. Carefully gave him 4 francs and did not realise until inside that my huge tip must have been about 2 &frac12;! The room allotted me was the same one as last year &amp; recognising</p>
