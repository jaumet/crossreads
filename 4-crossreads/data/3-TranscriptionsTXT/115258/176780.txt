Bill West is a great admirer of the corriedales and says he is going in for them when he gets back - I have asked him up home to show him ours after the war - I heard that Munro-Ferguson is going to send some corriedales to England to start a flock on his estates.
Am afraid there is not much news, we are still camped on the sand - just enjoying life generally. I say, boys dont let them play the goat with my photos any more. I don't mind them putting in any interesting ones of the country but I bar those of myself or other chaps in the regt. It is not considered at all correct here; and anyhow a person looks an awful ass in a paper - I did not come over to be an official photographer you know so please leave my name and photo out.
