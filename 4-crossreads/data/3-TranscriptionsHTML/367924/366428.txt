<p>There is no doubt that the Boss is a Champion for loosing dogs. Do you know if my grey mare had a foal or not. I saw by the papers that there was a lot of wash a ways along the G.S.R. line. There is no doubt that May only writes when she is in trouble. You forgot to send the portion of my letter, as it is not here remember me to old Mr. &amp; Mrs. Flanagan. I do not write to them, as they would only answer it, then I would have more writing still, the only ones I care to write to is Nell, Birts Wife &amp; you &amp; Jim Jeffery every now &amp; then. I do hope that Jim keeps alright, has Jim has been a real good friend to me.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that E.R.F. is a bright beauty, what with muddling up the A.N.A. funds &amp; to top the lot to say that I did not pay him, he was to busy telling me about his betting to remember me paying him evedintly. What did Jimmy Jones do with his horses. No it is no use worrying as what is to be will be &amp; I am just as safe here, as I would be home, look at all the things that have happened home there, I do hope that you have the luck to get all the Cards &amp; Photos that I have sent you.</p>
<p>Well the food has been a lot better here lately. It is a job washing here, as your clothes get full of dust before they can get dry. Did the Boss send Richless any where this year. I hope that you will see Levi long before you recieve this letter &amp; he will give you all the news.</p>
<p>Well I think the War will last another twelve months easy enought, but I think that we are getting the best of them now every where except in Russia, but we will knock them in the finish alright. Good Bye for the present. I will close with wishing both of you the best of health. Give my best wishes to Olive. Thank Olive for the Kaisers Dream.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your every loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
