<p>our guns. We found the enemy present in great numbers but none of them showed any disposition to fight. In several cases we surrounded small parties of them and massacred them. Most of them took refuge in their dugouts and we found it impossible to get into them. We were only out for about an hour and can account for sixteen killed. Besides this there were numerous casualties of which I  can not give an estimate. I venture to state that the casualties would have been at least twice as many only for the fact that there was a moat, over which we could not cross, into which numbers of the enemy took refuge. Despite the cold they took to the water like ducks and swam underwater almost across the stream.<br/><u>We had no casualties on our side</u> I received a slight wound through tripping over the enemies wire and  thereby sustaining a small abrasion. We had another raid to-night but only killed four. We never bother burying the dead as the enemy carry them off and I am shocked to relate eat them. It shows how scarce the food must be.<br/>Strange to say I felt no fear and not the slightest compunction in killing them. I accounted for four myself and wounded several. They are present in hundreds round here and root and scratch and squeak all round our dugout during the night. If we were here a few more nights our raiders would soon reduce the number of them in the vicinity. It is the only exercise we get in the trenches, and we have great fun rushing after them across the open field behind our dugout. Whenever one is spotted the finder yells tally-ho! and gives chase and the rest of us join in the pursuit. Further up</p>
