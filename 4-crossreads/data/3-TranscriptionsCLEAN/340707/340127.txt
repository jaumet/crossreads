  
 1 this afternoon. I return the pony & trap to Foxholm before leaving the pony now quite understands me & will come to my call, much to other peoples surprise - 
 I met Baines at Foxholm & search [indecipherable] for trains & finally wander home through the fields of fragrant bluebells to the Manor House, where I dine on [indecipherable] in the big dining room & then have a final walk in the wilderness which has quite caught my fancy & set off for Weybridge which has a choice of routes to Codford but the time of connection the official refuses to disclose as it would mean travelling by the other company 
 This lands me at Salisbury & I revisit the cathedral & glorious exterior & plain interiors to [indecipherable] of which admission is charged, eg chancel - always & casus belli to me & finally reach camp about 7 pm 
 27-5-19 No new through to-day but visit QM see Cpl Costing & change all my gear & hand in overcoat & trousers as I have no need for them. No one has yet returned from leave - everything including meals is go as you please - 
 Visit Education officer & see Mearns who is in charge of matters & promises
