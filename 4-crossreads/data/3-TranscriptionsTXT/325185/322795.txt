 France 27.9.17 
 Dear Father I am enclosing a photo in this letter for you.I met an old mate of mine.I hadent seen him for over two years so we decided to have the photo taken together.

One has to see it to fully realize the damage that has been done. I received a card from Bert a few days ago he said he had couple of his letters written to me
