<p>Ari Bournu<br/>Anzac<br/>My dear Weir,<br/>Letter writing exceedingly difficult &amp; unpleasant owing to the cramped positions &ndash; The indigestion I have suffered from for a week or so &amp; the flies which are far worse than they were in Egypt. Many thanks for your letters you stick to your post very [indecipherable]. What <u>does</u> happen to our letters to you &ndash; only 2 days steam away &amp; weeks seem to elapse before one gets an answer. The few men we have left here are very sick (many of them) [indecipherable] post &amp; I can not lay my hands on any money. In May I went to the Col for money after he had borrowed some &pound; 1000. The pipes &amp; backy are appreciated but tho' I hear you sent stationery I have not heard of its arrival. There will be a pound more I hope soon &amp; many will chew the dust. &ndash; a  good thing to do something as all are fed up with staying in the one spot &ndash; we have only gained about 20ft since we came here. I cant get an inch more. Granville is away sick &amp; was on a hosp ship for 2 or 3 days while I climbed thro a [indecipherable] belly with influenza. You must now have quite 30 of our men &amp; it is considered here almost as much a scandal as the Mt Nelson in Cape Town. It meant the work is twice as hard or [indecipherable] here Very hot &ndash; not to bad on you but we have no shade or change. Remember me kindly to the Col I trust to get our men back soon,<br/>with 52 new [indecipherable].Yours very Sincerely H.V.V.</p>
