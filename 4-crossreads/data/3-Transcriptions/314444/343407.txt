<p>are always having a friendly spar.  Charlie was looking for Mick one morning at 9. o'c and couldn't find him in his room or in the bath or anywhere upstairs, but discovered him in the kitchen in his pyjamas pressing a crease into his slacks. He sure is making himself at home &amp; Mrs P &amp; Charlie think he is just great. Even Ada the servant has got used to him by this. Of course little Phyllis and Bobbie are very strong for Uncle Mick and each morning may be found in his bed giving him a love up.</p>
<p>Yesterday we spent the day at Chingford with the Hawkes and what a day it was. Just after we arrived there the most violent snowstorm began which lasted for the rest of the day.  Naturally we did not move out till it was time to go home and we did not forget to rub it in about the lovely climate. We had however a lovely time there and Mrs. Hawke &amp; Queenie filled us up with all sorts of good things.</p>
<p>On Friday I saw our 5000 troops march through London and they looked very well and good a very good reception. The display over London by our airmen however took the bun and is easily the best ever seen here A certain red machine was the most talked of and turned out to be Les Holden.  You never saw anything like the stunts they were doing just clear of the tops of the buildings along the Strand.</p>
<p>My shoulder is ever so much better and I hope will be OK by the 1st.</p>
<p>I saw Gilbert Hughes looking</p>
