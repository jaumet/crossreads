  
 to the Camp, it looks pretty good. Interned German civilians are employed here at 7d per hour doing painting & odd jobs, some receive 9d. All men wear armlets here Purple on the staff, Blue A class  Green [erased; B class?] Yellow unclassified Red C classes. 
 Saturday fine, though chaps who came when I did had to go before the S.M.O. (Major) a lot of our papers failed to come, mine amongst them, expect they will be sent for then we will see the S.M.O. but it is only a farce. 
 Sunday, church parade, went for a walk. 
 Monday Lovely day, All C class men (1,2,3) & B.2.B. men are taken for a walk, both morning & afternoon when they are not wanted, we only go a couple of hundred yards & lay down. It is a real farce. Went for a walk tonight. Tuesday Sept 25 dull morning but clearing away; went for a walk after tea & enjoyed it.
