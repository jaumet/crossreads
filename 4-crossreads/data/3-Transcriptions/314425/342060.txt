Last night some shells burst not far from our camp. I am on 1st picquet tonight with W.A. Wilson 9 to 12.15. Yesterday some teams not of our brigade were observed and shelled by the enemy near the front line.<br/>At several canteens here we can buy Australian brands of</p>

I received two letters from my wife to date &ndash; dated April 15 No. 130 and April 18. 131 also one from Annie Kennedy Otway St Portland of April 14.<br/>[shorthand symbols] (I wrote to my wife this evening.Letter 133. 2 pages)</p>
