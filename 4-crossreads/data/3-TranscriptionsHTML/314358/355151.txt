<p>effective I admit, but a picture for all that)</p>
<p>One which I did not expect to see in the heart of misty London.<br/>It is pleasant to see even this one free winged touch of nature to gladden the commercially fettered mortal in his great drab streeted prison of civilisation.</p>
<p>It is a picture with much in it for once with eyes to see.</p>
<p>Sketches and impressions and [indecipherable] gems, perhaps masterpieces.</p>
<p>All gatherings in a city like London have enough history and tragedy in them to make many volumns.<br/>See there, standing just a trifle forward, is a young girl with a face as sad as it is beautiful.</p>
<p>Must catch post<br/>Much love Geoff</p>
