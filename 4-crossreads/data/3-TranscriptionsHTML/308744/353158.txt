You gained for us absolute supremacy of the air thereby enabling my cavalry, artillery and infantry to carry out their work on the ground practically unmolested by hostile aircraft. This undoubtedly was a factor of paramount importance in the success of our arms here. I desire therefore to personally congratulate you on your splendid work. I congratulate not only the Flying Officers, but also your mechanics for although the Officers did the work in the air, it was good work on the part of our Mechanics that kept a high percentage of your machines serviceable. I wish you all 'bon voyage' and trust that the peace now attained will mean for you all future happiness and prosperity. Thank you and good-bye."</p>
