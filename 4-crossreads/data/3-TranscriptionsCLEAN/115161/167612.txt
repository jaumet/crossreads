When marching we would not keep in step, as this is easily detected by placing an ear to the ground.  You try this.  Place your ear on the ground and get someone to smack the earth a good distance off, and you will detect the sound, where it would be impossible so to do in the ordinary way.  Of course this would be more pronounced on clear land and especially so on a hard surface such as frozen ground.
