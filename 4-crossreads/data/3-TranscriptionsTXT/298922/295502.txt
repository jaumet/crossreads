 Tuesday 3 July 
 Started off on a 2 days stunt expect some fighting &amp; on return I hope to go Cairo on Regimental business &ndash; Turksare all around us here &amp; we get the usual evening plane over us daily &amp; see some good fights. We move again tonight at midnight &amp; get in touch at 6 A.M. 40 miles there &amp; back to blaze the track for our railway to B--? 
 We got 8 Turksby ambush yesterday. Their lances make good bivy poles.  When I say WE I mean the 4th L.H. not my particular Regiment.
