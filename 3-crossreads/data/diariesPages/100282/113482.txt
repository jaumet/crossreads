Mr Beckett came back to the Coy took charge for the time being.
9th. Usual morning parades Mr Beckett took the Coy over, in the afternoon we had a rare bit of fun playing hockey all the officers were playing things were very willing. I got a beautiful smack over the eye I saw all sorts of pretty lights as you may guess, then later on I got 2 square inches of skin knocked off my right knuckle a gash along the thumb, but for all that I enjoyed myself thoroughly, she is getting a good hold of the Coy now, all the boys are taking to it.
