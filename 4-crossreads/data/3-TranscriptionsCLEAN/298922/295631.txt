 Colder this morning - but we should feel thankful to be afloat & also well. I had a hateful nightmare last night. I had let my squadron down in a retirement & I felt all the horror of the bullets around me & I rode away - am I really a cur I wonder - or is it only liver thro' over eating. 10 days at sea now & only off Portugal. We have men on board who have been torpedoed several times, & their nerves are not of the best. When will it all end I wonder.
