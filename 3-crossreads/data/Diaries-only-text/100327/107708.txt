with great interest by the local residents. One fine looking smiling woman had a beautiful good natured baby in her arms on which I bestowed "un pen" as backsheesh. Left the mule to follow on in charge of an orderly and walked home. These hills and dales with their peaceful villages lying in the afternoon sun looked very pretty. The occasional springs and little streamlet offer a welcome drink to the traveller How much would we give to have one or two in the trenches. 
Coming into camp passed antiaircraft guns and their crews and Turkish prisoners camp ? the latter surrounded with barbed wire fences the prisoners housed in bell tents and carrying their dixies of food from the fires where they have their own cook. Further along met others returning from work all wearing the tarbousch chatting gaily. Some weeds but most wiry tough looking gentlemen. An aeroplane flew very low and watching it alight skimming along on its wheels round to its shed. 
Saw signallers and looked up my men. Arranged with Capt Stow at Canteen for transport for my cases at 0930 tomorrow morning and hope to get a trawler for Anzac the day after next. The troops now get rum every night and all take it. The cry "Fall in for rum!" is a very popular one. Roused hell out of Mitchell and put the fear of God into him He has been getting a bit slack but now is running about finding work and cut my hair today
Bed early
