 Tuesday 25 September 1917 Still a good gale blowing &amp; as our boat had when leaving Sydney a fair list to starboard, we pitch &amp; toss quietly all the time.  Still I cannot feel any effects now.  Brush &amp; comb stolen during night &ndash; why oh why can people not keep the 8th commandment! The Southern Cross still shines bright in the sky &amp; I say goodnight to it &amp; to Australia leaning over the rail watching the waves chasing one another in endless procession.
