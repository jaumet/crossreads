  
 I could not find out.  An item of news in it was the death of Mr. Trefle.  I shall write briefly to his widow. 
 Another piece of information was given to me by a man upon I operated about one week ago.  He had a letter in which 'twas written that a son had had come to Belle Moxham.  Won't she & Herschell be proud?  Quite an event in the Moxham and Harris dovecote!  Please convey my congratulations when you have opportunity? 
 The rumours of the last few days are assuming shape, and it is probable that within brief space now we shall pack up our traps and be on the road for another spot in the world upon which to play a hand in the great and wonderful game.  If it be my fortune to return to Australia sound in mind and body much that is being stored in my mind will flow forth from day to day for the information and instruction of you and my friends. 
 Early this evening I was reading in the Times history of the war about air ships and aeroplanes.  How rapidly have they grown from the experimental to the practically useful stage?  It is but 51/2 years since the first flight of public consequence was made in the world that wherein a man flew across the Straits of Dover from Calais to Dover.  The newspaper account of it is fresh in my mind.  It was Bleirot [Bleriot], a Frenchman who did it.  His machine landed with good fortune in a field behind the English town, he being thereby made the hero of the hour, and his ship, a biplane, the wonder of the age. 
 9 a.m.  No letters.  It is strange that two letters from Moss Vale & a newspaper from Melbourne should arrive here in less

 Lawrence Herschel Levi Harris (Lawrence Herschel Levi), known as Herschel Harris (1871-1920), radiologist and army medical officer, volunteered in England soon after the outbreak of war. As a Captain with the Royal Army Medical Corps, he joined the Australian Voluntary Hospital. He was promoted to Major in 1915 and was transferred to the 3rd Australian General Hospital on Lemnos. He was invalided home to Australia suffering from X-ray dermatitis in early 1916.]
