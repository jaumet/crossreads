report, it can meananything.In an advance like the one on now a man may be killed & not buried & identified for some time, we buried such a lot of "Tommies" before we advanced at Pozieres & collected their discs etc. "this is a bit gruesome so will ease up on this strain". Anyway I will do all I can to clear his case up & advise her to write his Commanding officer, which is the only way to find out as each man has his record kept.Re myself, I am doing fine now, am not allowed to walk yet but dress & go around in a chair, as soon as the skin grows over my wounds I will be able to walk straight out the door, muscles aren't affected at all & even now I can walk "that is if the sister isnt looking" with
