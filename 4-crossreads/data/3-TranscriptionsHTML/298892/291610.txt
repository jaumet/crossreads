<p>Larkhill, Camp No. 21.<br/>Saturday, 21st. October 1916.</p>
<p>My Dear Parents:-<br/>In accordance with my promise I am now commencing to write something each day. I missed last night owing to a slight billious attack. It seems strange to be admitting to a billious attack on the camp diet. In truth we have nothing to complain of in the matter of feeding now, although things are run on strictly economical lines. Every particle of bread is used up. When any scraps are over from a meal they appear in the disguise of bread pudding at the next. Also any food that is over from the Mess, except what has actually been on the men's plates and mauled about, has to be returned to the Kitchen, and is dished up again. The cooks have all been through school, where they learnt to save on cooking wherever possible.<br/>All scraps, too, have to be kept carefully separated - the bones and fat are boiled down and used in the manufacture of munitions, and the rest provides food for animals; pigs I suppose. Despite these precautions the food is very good and there is plenty of everything excepting sugar. Many a good pudding is spoiled for want of it and the tea is scarcely worth drinking. This scarcity has only been noticeable since the Government took over the control of the sugar</p>
