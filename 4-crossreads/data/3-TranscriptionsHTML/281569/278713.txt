<p>6 August, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>The 3rd Bde along with a mtd Bde carried out operations against Jacko at Katia this morning with every success, our captives now are 3050 prisoners, 4 guns, 8 m guns, 800000 rds small arm ammunition &amp; tons of equipment  we got all the signalling gear &amp; its fine being made out of aluminium &amp; is extremely portable the holding capacity is about the same, our planes have kept them on the move &amp; very few Taubes are to be seen anywhere. Hal has been recommended for promotion as Sig Officer to 4 Regt &amp; is to proceed to France for duty, none of the other Bdes have officers to spare so he should get it.</p>
<p>Bed early &ndash; no mail.</p>
<p>7 August, 1916 Monday</p>
<p>95 wks from home</p>
<p>Expected to be on the move any minute today but no such luck the 3rd Bde &amp; NZ's are pushing them back gradually &amp; should be into Oghratina tomorrow with half an ounce of luck, my loot is still increasing &amp; is getting quite a problem now mail is arriving spasmodically the railway is used for munitions only now, troops are everywhere &amp; if they had been here during the attack out horsemen could have rounded up the lot &amp; put up even a better performance than we have prisoners now number 3300, 4 guns &amp; many machine guns with complete German [indecipherable] so the boys did splendidly.</p>
