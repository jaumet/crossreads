is quite close to our camp.
I sent my pay book away this morning to England to have it audited so as I can see how I stand.
I have just been thinking of the last artillery duel I saw that was the other day, the Germans began it on a lovely morning lobbed the first shells on to our trenches did not stop till they had got rid of 4 or 5000, I don't suppose 1% of them done any damage to either life or limb, in spite of the skill of the German gunners the accuracy of their guns, but the guns on both sides put you in mind of a choir, where one sings the other answer's away they go for all they are worth.
