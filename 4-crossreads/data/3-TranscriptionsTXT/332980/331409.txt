Friday Thursday & Friday, I again journeyed to Dunkirk, Thursday I did not wander about but stayed in the Hostel reading, Friday after Lunch I took a Train out past Milo Le Sands to the Terminus about 7 Kilos away & went over to the Beach which was also deserted & very desolate, I stayed there for an hour & then returned to the Station & back again to St. Omer.
Saturday 29/6/18.Being my last day learning the Road to Dunkirk I decided on arrival at Dunkirk to return at 10 am via Boubourg & Gravelines, & at that hour departed & at 10 am 11.40 am arrived at Calais. I met a chum from Audruicq who was likewise learning the roads & we went for a stroll, first into the Church Army Hut for something to eat & then up through Old Calais, where we aboarded a Tram for a ride to Les Fontinettes & back, then for a stroll again up the Streets & off at 2.30 Pm for St Omer via Les Fontinettes, Audruicq & Watten, my chum left me at Audruicq & at 4 Pm I arrived
