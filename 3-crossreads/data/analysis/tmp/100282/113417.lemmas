 Heaven how miser rotten asham I feel of my countri I was alway so proud of Australia all she has done in this war now our name is mud , we all feel as how we can scarc look ani one of the other coloni in the face , oh how I wish that we could lay our hand on the B--------- swine it would be some consol to punch their lousi head to a pulp , then jump their gut out for them , I would do it with pleasur myself . Australia ca n't be much of a place to live in at the present time , it pretti evid that all the best have gone from our one time beauti land , oh how proud we all were of her , we use to hold our head so high look the whole world in the face , now it all a thing of the past , seem like a bad dream to me for we ca n't accept the fact of the Australian peopl turn us down so bad , it is as much as to say , serv you right for go away good enough for you if you get kill
