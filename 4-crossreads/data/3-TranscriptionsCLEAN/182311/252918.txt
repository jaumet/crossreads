   The awards for the 29th of September to 2nd Oct-ober stunt are not all out yet, only the lowest, the M.M's are out, and my boys have scored four of them, I'm hoping for another D.C.M. for a Sergt. and a Military Cross for an officer whom I recommended. Later for this battle I recd Bar to M.C.
   Up to now there is, I think, no more news, so I'll cut off to bed now.
 
   Best wishes from
