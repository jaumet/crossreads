<p>Hutchinson   &amp;  I are going to Cairo on Sunday for the day there is a lot of wounded going back to Australia from here in a day or two   &amp;  a lot of rejects   &amp;  deceased from the hospitals I think some of our fellows will go astray too it is a different place to Sydney   &amp;  they don't see, to see any danger</p>
