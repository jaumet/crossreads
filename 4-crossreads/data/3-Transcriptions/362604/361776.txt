We arrived in Havre at 6.15 p.m. &amp; had a walk around until about 7.30 p.m. &amp; then came on up here.  The streets are fine &amp; the place looks grand at night time, it is so well lit up &amp; we have been used to such dark towns.  Well, my dear ones, we have come to the best camp &amp; best place on our Travels this time &amp; again on the 13th.  Is it not strange?  We expect to be here 6 or 8 months &amp; by that time we aught to be marching Home to you all.  It is supper time now, so I will join the Boys &amp; then I must toddle off to shave &amp; go to bed.</p>
<p>We are as happy as can be &amp; now we may be sure to be Home for X'mas 1819.</p>
<p>Best of Love to you all,<br/>Harry.</p>
