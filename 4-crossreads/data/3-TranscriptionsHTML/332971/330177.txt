<p>but meeting 4 English Nurses who were going to the old capital of Malta &amp; then on to the ruins of Hadjih Kim &amp; kindly inviting us to go with them we changed our minds &amp; gladly went.  The ruins were much like "Stonehenge" they date back to 1500 B.C.  The caretakers pointed out the Alters where the animals were burnt as sacrifices, gave us a little piece of pottery to keep as a memento.  After resting for awhile on a cliff overlooking the lovely blue Meditteranean, we start off back- some 12<strike>0</strike> miles.  The scenery all the way is typically biblical.  We saw them threshing corn with mules &amp; oxen &amp; they keep to the old old style of costume.  On returning everyone is full of the day, some had gone out to the caves &amp; actually saw the cave in which St Paul sought shelter for 3 months, visited St Johns Chapel &amp; the Chapel of bones-  I regret very much to have missed those.</p>
<p>Tuesday 29th<br/>Sometime tonight we arrive at Alexandria.  The journey has been a pleasant one.  Sister Hoadley Rush- Mitchell Taylor &amp; myself will never forget the happy afternoon we spent in playing 500.  The Colonel <strike>of</strike> &amp; Doctor of the Welsh regiment loved to join in with us- we are hoping sometimes to invite them to our tents to afternoon tea at Lemnos.</p>
<p>Sunday August <strike>9th</strike> 1st 1915<br/>I'm sorry for my poor diary to be neglected so- we arrived at A- in the small hours of the 30th (Australia Day)</p>
