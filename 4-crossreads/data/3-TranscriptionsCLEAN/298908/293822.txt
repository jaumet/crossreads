I done a very foolish thing when I walked on the station at Paddington.  I saw a bunch of "Mothers Pets" (Military Police) pulling the chaps up & then I never tumbled but walked right into them.  Of course they wanted to see my pass.  I took my pocket book out but could not find it, so he said oh never mind Sgt. your name will do & I fool like gave him my right one.  I never jerried till I had done it & then I felt inclined to kick myself for I could easily have given him a crook one.  Our time was up at 12 & we should have been back in Camp.  The funny part of it was that practically all the lads fell into it the same way as I did, but it don't worry us in the slightest.
30th.  Arrived back in Camp at 10 this morning & found quite a few more of the old lads there from different places such as Weymouth Warminster Tidworth & etc. but still no news of our moving.  This waiting is getting a bit sickening & I for one am fed right up to the neck & further if possible.
