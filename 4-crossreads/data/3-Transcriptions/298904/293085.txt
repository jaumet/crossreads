<p>ports I have seen. There were no hoardings or any other unsightly looking signboards knocking about, one missed the "Johnny Walker" &amp; Black &amp; White" advertisements here &amp; ports can well do without them<br/>The town is very pretty for practically all the buildings are white walled &amp; red tiled roofs which make them look very nice &amp; uniform<br/>we were not allowed on shore here, much as we would have liked to get off &amp; have a look round, the "Knight Templar &amp; Grampian" were in port the former had the artillery on board &amp; the latter the 3rd Battalion</p>
