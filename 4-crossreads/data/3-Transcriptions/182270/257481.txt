<p>WEDNESDAY, JUNE 18, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; cold. Father &amp; Mother &amp; Peter &amp; I</p>
<p>went into Quirindi in the big car.</p>
<p>Father &amp; I attended the court &amp; were</p>
<p>fined &pound;5 &amp; costs for not killing rabbits</p>
<p>They went home for lunch &amp; I stayed</p>
<p>in. Went up to &quot;Woodlawn&quot; with</p>
<p>Owie &amp; Laurie &amp; played tennis all</p>
<p>the afternoon. Caught the 9.30 train</p>
<p>to Sydney at night.</p>
