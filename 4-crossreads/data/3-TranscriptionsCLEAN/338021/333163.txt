Very heavily shelled all night all calibres still going yet. Am getting up all that bulk S.A.A. to dump near road. Men rather shaken & would like rum ration. Lt Cowley reported I have sent for Mitchell. I have been in agony all night with feet, little better this morning after rubbing will try & carry on here. Have plenty of Rations, not much water. Can I tell the men when they are being returned to buck them up
