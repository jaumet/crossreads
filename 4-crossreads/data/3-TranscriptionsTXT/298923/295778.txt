22 April 1918 MondayThe Carmilite Monastery Comedy Coy: (our men) give their last performance tonight viz:- "7 days leave"- as we go back tomorrow & so far I have not got my leave-  I went with Military Governor to a Greek Monastery of Saint George where the Priest takes madmen & cures them with the Chain of St George for 4/-/- a month-  If no money they die-  I asked what the insulators & wires were in each room & the Priest said, to convey the healing spirit of St George from the Chapel in the Monastery- awful old ruffian the British will no doubt stop his business soon
