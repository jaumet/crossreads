Do you know the facts in connection with the existing trouble inside of the fence? Here they are:
Two internees tried to escape but were stopped by the guard As a consequence the recreation grounds for the use of the internees were closed, and it was also prohibited to work the vegetable gardens of the prisoners 
which were cultivated with much labor and now decreed by that terrible tyrann Holman to rot. Think of it, 4500 persons made responsible for the doings of 2 fellow internees! Is this not the act of a madman ?
Beware soldiers! This tyrann, which is starving us to-day, may decree the same fact to you to-morrow. Soldiers wake up! Do not let yourself be made tools for cruelly oppress those, who perhaps to-morrow will stand side by side with you to fight an common enemy ?Tyranny?
Hear the watchword of Europe awaking:
Long live Liberty, Fraternety, Equality and down with those who force us to slaves.
Think of it soldiers! Nearly 5 years behind the barb-wire cut off from all intercourse with the outside world, the satisfaction of man's natural needs made impossible and yet there comes a madman, who wants to starve us into submission, merely because we dared to stand up for our rights not to be made responsible for the doings of others
Be men! Go and have the facts about what is happening

in the camp published and see that this tyrann Holman is where he ought to be, namely sunk into obliviousness.
What pitiful spectacle it would be, if this cowardly hypocritical madman would you to force us to submit to his devilish likings
Think before you act, and you will know what to do,
