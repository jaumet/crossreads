<p>from this part of the world, at the University, beyond a few that a French man had given him, and they were from the canal. I hope that he will be pleased with those sent through you. I have written to him advising him of the dispatch of the parcel.</p>
<p>The war still goes merrily on, the Russians running as rapidly as of yore and telegraphing to the newspapers like silly stories. For example, for some weeks we have been daily told that the running away of the Bear was a great strategic piece of work and that it was designed to trap the German armies and destroy in manner similar to the method adopted by the same people gainst Napoleon I. Yet to day we have wires coming through aclaiming loudly that the Russia armies in the South of the Eastern front are defeating the Austrians and taking thousands of prisoners. Taken altogether the impression is created that those responsible for the wires are playing fast and loose with the public, treating them in the same manner as has been so common day by day in the war, the highly placed authors believing that the public exist to be deceived by those of high degree and in high station, but in these times when every one, practically, in our Empire can read and write, and dares to think the game is a risky one. Of late I have wished to be at home for a few hours that I might tell Jack Fitzgerald across the floor of the L. Council [Legislative Council] what I think of his statements anent the subject brought forward by Sir. Allen Taylor, I would with much pleasure recommend him to consult an occulist to gain information as to whether he is blind or not. He said that he could not see loafers about. Well he who can honestly make such a statement must indeed be blind.<br/>You will have noted that Lloyd George has declared for Conscription. Driven to it by the fact that those concerned will not put forth every ounce of the energy which God has given them to help defend the country by producing what is required. Is it not sad to think that at any moment, much less the present one, there exists mongst reasonable people the idea that work should not be performed by every man to the highest of his power? For what else can a person be sent into the world, than to do his full share of the labour that awaits his energies? And now there are apparently those who will not recognise that our fight is not against a people but for our existance as a nation in the world, against the greatest military organisation that has existed through all time. It makes me sad to think that any one can be so debased as not always, let alone now, to recognise that it is his duty to do his best. However the existing state of affairs bids fair to land us in an inextricable mess, which will leave many countries broken in finance and lowered in prestige mongst the nations. Just think</p>
<p>[John Daniel (Jack) Fitzgerald (1862-1922), journalist, barrister and socialist politician. He was appointed to the NSW Legislative Council in 1915 and was vice-president of the Executive Council until 1919. He supported conscription and as a result was expelled from the Labor Party in 1916, but served in the Holman Nationalist Party government in NSW, becoming minister for public health and for local government in the same year.</p>
<p>Sir Allen Arthur Taylor (1864-1940), business man and conservative politician, was appointed for life to the NSW Legislative Council in 1912. Following reform of that body in 1933, he was elected for a six-year term, and re-elected in 1940.]</p>
