Fortunately we’re not right out to it – there’s enough left to do fancy stunts at 6 knots while the weather holds & thus we’re not salvage. The old man & mates used dreadful language in front of us soldiers too! We rather wish she were a twin screw & could smash the other. It would be an education.
26th The old bosun goes down the trap every few minutes to view the ship. He comes up to work off his feelings on any part of the army that sits handy. "Crawlin" up to Dakar would afford R.K. a fine subject. Afraid the war will end before we see land again.
Blasted shark swimming astern – takes an occasional jaunt up the port side with her nose & down astern, then goes over to Africa for lunch, returning immediately.
Evening Have changed our mind – are going to America. No reason given
27th Lame duck still waddling west. They have doused the lights as from last night, adding to our joys greatly. Submarine pickets detailed, double posts, & ball ammunition – to shoot periscopes! ( we’re minus the big g’s).
28th Course altered early & pickets redoubled. Ran NW for a while then respectively, N, NE, NW, NE, E, SW, S, & SE. Can’t say very definitely whats wrong but the above speaks volumes. Chaplain’s came down & talked to all hands told us to be ready for anything. Boats sway out. Axes ready for cutting lashings, lifebelts checked & ‘spares’ put handy. Rumbling all day in a thick haze., ship suddenly quiet & orderly. O.C. told us we’d not sleep if we knew half of what he knew.
