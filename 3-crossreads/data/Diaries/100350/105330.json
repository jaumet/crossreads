Enemy replied towards dusk and did some damage to our Parapets &amp; dug-outs. Lieut Davis and myself out on Patrol into \"No mans land\" about 10 o,clock to find out how much damage our guns had inflicted on the Hun trenches. We had to keep on the alert because the enemy flew up flares continually, as they must have been expecting an attack from our boys, we got pretty close to enemys lines and could hear them jabbering away while they repaired the damaged works. So we started on our return journey about 2 o,clock in the morning, after reaching our barb wire the fun started, it takes some wriggling through, however while we were twisting about one of their flare light revealed our position and the put over 3 bursts of machine gun fire, the bullets pinged into the ground about us but we never got hit. As a matter of fact I thought the end had come. We had to remain still untill the flare went out, and then made a dash for our lines which we reached safely, me with my togs torn to shreds after my argument with the barb-wire, some joke I can assure you. However alls well that ends well. Our Commanding Officer was well pleased with our investigations. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a4630056\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 56]<br><br />\n[July 1916]</p>\n<p>(8) Beautiful Summer Day.
