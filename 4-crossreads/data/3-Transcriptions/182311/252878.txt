<p>&quot;<u>A FRAGMENT FROM FRANCE</u>.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(All that remains of a letter written to the Secretary of the Albert Park Lodge of the Australian Natives Association, about 1917)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . &quot;parties though excitement is furnished when he picks up a party and shells it.&nbsp; This afternoon the yarns in our tent turned towards Australia and the excellence of things Australian.&nbsp; At one time the boys used to sing of &quot;Dear Old Blighty&quot; (England) now after many have returned after a wild &quot;Blighty Leave&quot; or perhaps after being wounded, from furlough they sing:</p>
<p>&quot;Blighty is a failure,</p>
<p>&quot;Take me to Ausralia.&quot;</p>
<p>And so with everything, for although the British Army Supplies and rations are quite good and sufficient, those articles coming from Australka are always much, much better.&nbsp; When we lose our original Australian blankets they are replaced at times by others good enough but not nearly as comfy or as warm.&nbsp; The news that there is a supply of &quot;Ossy&quot; boots sends everyone to the Q.M&#39;s Store, neat boots, comfortable and really waterproof are our Australian issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I returned from my Investiture trip to London with a felt hat which I had brought from Australia and left in my trunk at Cox&#39;s, London, well, everyone made friendly attempts to exchange it or purloin it, for its the &quot;Dinkum&quot; article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Clothing too, is just the same and when one ompares the rations it results in a win for, say, Australian jam, or indeed, everything else from home.</p>
