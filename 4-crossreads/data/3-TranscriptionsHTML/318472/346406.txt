<p>30 June 1918<br/>Sunday<br/>5 After Trinity</p>
<p>Put a few men through the equipment store in the morning &amp; in the afternoon rode a bike to Clacton &ndash; on Sea. It is a very nice little place &amp; I believe very fashionable &amp; gay in times of peace.</p>
<p>1918 July 1<br/>Monday<br/>Very quiet. Got about 40 men away in the afternoon. Italians are doing well according to reports &amp; British &amp; French have had successful minor affairs on the Western Front. Nice fine weather.</p>
