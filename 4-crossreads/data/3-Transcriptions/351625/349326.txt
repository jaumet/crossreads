<p>to give a lot lot of medals to different men &amp; officers who have <strike>one</strike> won them of late.  I have heard no word of Hosier since he left so hope he is doing all right.  My friend Huxley who has been away sick is expected back again in a few weeks.</p>
<p>I am afraid I have very little news to tell so will have to let this go rather short.  One good thing we have plenty of amusements here, a fairly good concert every evening given by different Battalion concert parties.  Give my love &amp; kisses to all &amp; whips for yourself.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Douglas</p>
