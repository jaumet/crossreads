My dear Judge
I am fit & well & having quite a good time here at present. I am again acting Second in Command & as such have been left out of the front line. I am well in rear in a good comfortable hut looking after the details of men who do not go into the line. There is a good deal of organisation work to be done but most of it can be done at a table & a good deal of it before I get up in the morning. The cold has not been nearly so severe just lately & the ground thaws every day.
Fritz is having a very uncomfortable time down here lately. How we all wish he would turn it in & let us go home. I have been very lucky missing two turns in the line & have seen practically no shelling. A few stray ones come over here occasionally but never seem to hit anything.
Sydney seems to have been turned upside
