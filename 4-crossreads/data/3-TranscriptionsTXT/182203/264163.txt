 [Letterhead Milton House, 25 Little Flinders Street, Melbourne.] Decr. 3.. 1914. Nurse E. S. Thistlethwaite was on the nursing staff of my private Hospital for about two years, commencing in June, 1908. For part of this time she had charge of the Operating Theatre, and during the occasional absences of the Head Sister she was in charge. I have much pleasure in stating that Nurse Thistlethwaite is a well-trained, efficient, and thoroughly trust-worthy nurse. She was strong and always in good physical condition for the performance of her duties. W.
