<p>1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 25 &nbsp; FEB.</p>
<p>Fine most of day, but had some heavy storms at night. We had a day off as our arms were very sore. I had a bad cold as well, so was not feeling to fit on it. Came in with Spes Wharton in a taxi and had afternoon tea at Farmer&#39;s and came over to Lisheen. Went back in a taxi with Hosking &amp; M<sup>c</sup>Innis out of the 5/2 DAC.</p>
