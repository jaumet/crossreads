  
 The Guest, J. Drinkwater 
 Sometimes I feel that death is very near, And, with half lifted hand, Looks in my eyes, and tells me not to fear, But walk his friendly land, Comrade with him, and, wise As peace is wise. 
 Then, gently though my heart with pity moves, For dear imperilled loves, I somehow know That death is friendly so, A comfortable spirit:  one who takes Long thought for all our sakes. 
 I wonder:  will he come that friendly way That guest, or roughly in the appointed day, And will, when the last drops of life are spent, My soul be torn from me, Or, like a ship truly and timely built, Slip quietly to sea?

 But the best was, we never tarried long in any place, and therefore might the more willingly endure one night's hardship, in hope the next night might be better.  And then we continued our march.

 And each man and each year that lives on earth Turns hither or thither and hence or thence is fed; And as a man  was  before was from his birth So shall a man be after among the dead. Swinburne, "Genesis", S.B.S.

 My spirit will not haunt the mound, Above my breast, But travel, memory possessed, To where my tremulous being found Life largest, best. Thomas Hardy 4.4.18
