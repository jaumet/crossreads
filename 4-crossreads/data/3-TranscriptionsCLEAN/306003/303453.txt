1-8-16Tue 1stRose at 6 oclock this morning finished stables & was just about to commence breakfast when we received the order to "stand to our horses" & shortly afterwards an enemy 'plane flew over us.  apparently she was only out for observation purposes as she dropped no bombs & did not stay long she also came over soon after dinner which meant leading horses off again & at 4 oclock this afternoon 9 of our planes dropped 78 bombs on Oghratina, a Taube chased them into camp after the bombardment;
Monitors also bombarded Oghratina & the aviators say they have altered the looks of Oghratina;  The 2nd Bde received several casualties today;  Watkins was not wounded a couple of days ago but was cut off & crawled into Qatia through the Turks in the dark
