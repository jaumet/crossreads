<p>The attacks were a failure owing to a poor wind, it hung about the German trenches &amp; never came over. Had about 40 cases for dressing.</p>
<p>19/7/16  Wednesday, Thursday &amp; Friday</p>
<p><u>At the Trenches</u> - expecting something big this evening &ndash; At 1 pm our artillery started &ndash; talk about Hell let loose. It is just deafening &amp; a good nerve tester. Shrapnel bursting all around, this is a very mild tho paper form of putting it. We have a dug out near a Battery, where we duck to when it gets too hot. I noticed the Brigade going into the trenches to day, they have a sort of heavy &ndash; dull manner, not usually like our Australians &ndash; perhaps we all know too well the same number will not return the same road. A Good victory to night will put some more heart &amp; spirit into them, for this I earnestly pray. Some of our F.A. Boys had to go into the first line of trenches as a lot of the Regimental bearers are no more &ndash; this is a bit rough on us as we are non combatant &amp; hardly trained for that kind of ordeal &ndash; I am quite resigned if I am to go, well, I must hope for one to send me there quickly &amp; no lingering</p>
