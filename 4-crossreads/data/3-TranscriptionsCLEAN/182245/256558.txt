FEBRUARY 1917
12 MONDAY
Fine but dull & cloudy. It was
warm though & most of the snow
has melted off the ground now.
I went for a bath in the morning
& cleaning harness all of afternoon.
The gun team had to turn out
in morning at 4 am & take our
gun down to near the trenches
& went up again in evening to
bring it back.
Got letters from Mother & Aunty
Florence. They have not been
getting my letters & are very
anxious. The postal arrangements
are rotten here.
