<p>Nov. 5th &ndash; Hod el Sawart<br/>This is our destination.  I don't know how to pronounce it &ndash; for the time being at any rate.<br/>Last night we had a heavy shower about 2 a.m.  There was dead silence everywhere until it stopped &amp; then a perfect volley of facetious remarks were let off.  We had to do rather a hurried get-away this morning &ndash; having 15 miles to do &amp; thus had no chance of drying our gear.<br/>I did not get wet last night but I have a very damp bed this evening I am afraid.<br/>This is quite a good place, it has been occupied before &amp; the occupants have left a lot of their improvements here so we ought to be fairly comfortable as things go if we don't get too much wet weather.<br/>But nowadays the sky is very English &amp; uncertain.</p>
