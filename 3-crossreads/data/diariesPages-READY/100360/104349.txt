Friday Mar. 2 [no entry]
Sat. Mar. 3. Busy day in Blanket Store. Got 2 patients to assist me & we put in some good work. After Tea went to see 5th Div. Concert in the Church Army Hut. They used our Stage & Hargrave assisted. Wrote long Letter to M.S. Got word that Col. Williams was severely wounded.

Sunday Mar. 4/17 Glorious day. Aeroplanes about in droves. 5th Div. Band played for Church Service. Fine music.

Mon. 5. About 40 of the 8th with Maj. Wooster & Capts. Irving, Catford & Riley marched to Edgehill & attended the funeral of Col. Williams. It was a very simple ceremony & he was put in a trench just the same as a Private. The Night birds" got another knock tonight. Bob Roberts is going to the Anzac Show, so we are left without a Producer.
