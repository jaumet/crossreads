Bitterly cold all day & showers & a little sleet. I went up to the dentist in the morning & he finished my teeth. With the director men ect in afternoon with Mr Neylan. Poss Nivison & self went into Amesbury to tea with Eileen Ross & a Miss Scott at the Abbey Hotel in evening & had to walk back, & it was no joke as we had to do it in 40 minutes but we did it in 35 min & just got in in time for tatoo.
