<p>enough with the old ammunition but a couple of days later, we were issued with rifles made to carry the new Mark VII ammunition, &amp; we had another go at the range the first target I shot at I hit once in 4 shots, &amp; Len done no better something was very much wrong so we altered our sights &amp; shot again, but done very little better Im hanged if we could get them to carry anyhow at all so we altered our sights for the 3rd time bringing them right back, that done the trick we were all shooting to high with the new rifle, the rifle I have at the present time has no "cut off" &amp; I like her well</p>
