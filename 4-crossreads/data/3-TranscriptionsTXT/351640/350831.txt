 got a little out of order,   We had to slow down during the repairs but soon regained our position in the fleet. 
 This morning the 20th, we passed the Maldive Islands and are now wending our way through the Arabian Sea.   It is a beautiful day, fairly cool with a calm sea.  Flying fish are plentiful.   Rumours of trouble are again becoming prevalent this time with the Turks, when we reach the Suez Canal. 
 I must now describe an exciting little experience which occurred this morning, the 21st at about 4 30 o'clock.  Everyone was awakened by what appeared to be a collision, and on rushing out on deck from my cabin, my first impression proved to be only too true, our line of ships composed the Euripides, Argylshire, Shropshire, Ascanius and Benalla, and for some unknown reason, though many rumours are current, our vessel ran right up to and severely bumped the Shropshire, about a quarter broadside on, and in endeavouring to get out of this grave position, another bump was experienced   The result meant very little to the Shropshire, but tore a hole in our ship about 20 feet long, and about 4 inches in width.

The Ascanius, I understand had been adjudged unworthy of negotiating the Red Sea, and is to be put in at Aden for repairs.  This incident of the collision will probably form a Naval Enquiry later on, when probably you will
