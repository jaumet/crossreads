<p>and most of us, including self, recommended for a week&#39;s rest camp, so are now waiting patiently to be sent down to Port Said. In the mean time as I said before there is very little work to do here and the tucker is absolutely the best I have ever seen in the army, with more vegitables than you can possibly eat so things are not too bad. I forgot to tell you that at Jericho they took a blood test from each one of us for malaria, and I was very pleased to find mine came back marked &quot;negative&quot;. The letters I received from &nbsp;you by last mail are dated 26th June, 22nd July and 2nd August. You must have had a pretty dry winter, having to hand fead all those cattle and sheep and I know what a lot of work it would be with the old chaffcutter; but I hope youe are having a real good season this spring and summer. The sale of those young <s>lambs</s> rams was great and that extra 5% on the wool very nice; when you have the lambs of all those ewes of Cousin Jocelyn&#39;s as well, your ram cheque ought to be worth something alright. I am very glad you are using my money again. I knew you would find it hard buying James&#39;s but it will be great to get hold of that place; I only wish I had not had to send home for that last cable you sent me; which by the way, has arrived safely</p>
