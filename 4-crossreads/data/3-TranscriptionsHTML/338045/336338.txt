<p>day is in full swing in the square, through country roads &amp; woods to Paris Plage, favourite seaside resort.  Most interesting but heavy winds blowing.  At 2 p.m. another march of about 4 miles past the camp &amp; we are all caught by a deluge of rain &amp; thoroughly drenched, having no coats.  Sit in our tents &amp; mess (minus tunics &amp; trousers) waiting for our clothes to dry.  Miserable day.  Feeling wretched, off colour &amp; rheumatism in calf.  Hardly able to walk.  Bed 9-30 p.m.  Mess dues 7fr. &amp; mess levy 2fr.</p>
<p>Oct. 28th &ndash; Saturday<br/>Got into a nice mess to-day.  Raining hard &amp; cold &amp; as I am not well parade</p>
