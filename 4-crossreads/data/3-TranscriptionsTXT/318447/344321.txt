Esdud. Nov 12th.22 15-30 miles up the coast from Gaza
We have caught up with the Brigade & are now camped just behind a village. There is a battery firing just a few hundred yards in front of us & a half battery of heavies firing a few hundred yards behind us so I expect we shall get shelled out of here soon.
The Turks have made a stand here & held us up for two days & now the 52nd Inf Division is up here attacking them. There is an enormous amount of material & guns abandoned back on the road & there must be at least 3000000
