<p>7th Training Battalion<br/>Heliopolis</p>
<p>25 Nov 1915<br/>We have been altered from the 6th to the 7th Training Battalion<br/>So may men have been arriving lately that additional Battalions have had to be formed and as we deal in units of the 7th Brigade we are the 7th, a lucky number</p>
<p>While [indecipherable] a hearty meal at the Sergeants mess this evening after having seen to the reception and feeding of 300 men just arrived, I had the extreme pleasure of receiving letters from you dear ones in Australia. All the fretting cares of a Quartermaster Sergeant vanished for a spell and I was with you for a moment watching you all fit up a surprise packet for Daddy at the front. I can see the picture clear enough as your goodly words have written it.</p>
<p>All good unselfish hearts joining together with their kindly thoughts for this indifferent warriors welfare</p>
