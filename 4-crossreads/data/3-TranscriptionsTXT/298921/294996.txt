 January, 1915 Saturday 23 Arrived Aden midday &ndash; high rocky cliffs, not unlike Gibraltar or Quebec:- As we passed the lighthouse, we noticed the attendants cottage was on fire. Arab "Dhows" sailing all around but no permission for boats to come near ships &amp; no man or officer is allowed ashore. Orderly officer today. Sick men better. Will post this here &amp; hope you may get it.
