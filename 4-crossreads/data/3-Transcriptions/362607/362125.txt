<p>Bowral 25.2.22</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Koch,<br/>Many happy returns of to- day with every good wish from both of us. So you see I have not forgotten your Birthday but had I thought of it yes  -  you might have had a chance to get this card in time. I am sorry now that I am so late in sending it. I hope Frieda received my letter during the first week of our stay up here   &amp; that you are all well   &amp;  I presume you are settled down in your new home. Last Monday we moved to "The Luxembourg" Bowral   &amp; letters are forwarded from the Post Office to us here. This is a very nice boarding house. We will leave for Sydney next Monday night the 6th March   &amp;  go straight through  [indecipherable] greetings   &amp;  best wishes from Albert &amp; Augusta<br/>The "Gib" is the Hill on the right of the picture</p>
