3/9/15 Busy censoring letters when marching orders came. We sail tomorrow for Anzac at 11am. Carring 2 days iron ration ? one waterbottle full has to do us for two days
4/9/15 All bustle at 6.30 with ration drawing. Up on boatdeck a fresh cold wind blowing and the water all churned up. The harbour a memorable sight. The green country-side alround and in the water the large ships; the two rows of warships lying right down the centre. Across in lines are the large liners The Maurietania with her four funnels is about a mile off and looks quite small. The Empress Britain crowded from stem to stern. Sailing serenely down the centre a large hospital ship painted pure white all over except for the large red crosses.
9am. We leave on "Osmania" at 11 oclock. All hands getting loaded up with rations etc. The men carrying firewood as there is said to be none over there. Two ASC men at this late hour ? blind eye!!
