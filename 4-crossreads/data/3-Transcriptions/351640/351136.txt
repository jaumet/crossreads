<p>Jim Roach wrote that he spoke with a man from my hospital, and that the man at once jumped up shook him by the hand &amp; said how pleased he was to meet anyone who knew such a gentleman as Colonel Nash. Good.</p>
<p>Just fancy, twice in one day I saw "The Pug" in his office and the dirty black pipe was not in his mouth. Remarkable! Eh?</p>
<p>6 p.m. "Just fancy meeting you! By jove! Who'd have thought it! Such a long way from home? Where are you living? At Gezeirah. By yourself? No. Miss McPhillamy is with me. What are you doing? Giving some help at Gezeirah. How long have you been here? About one month. How was Mother, Father, and the others when you left? All very well. Heard from them since your arrival? Last week yes. Good."<br/>Conversation between Florrie Delorhey &amp; me on the colonade in front of Shepheards Hotel at 4-30 o'clock this afternoon. She look just about the usual in a white costume.</p>
<p>Have lost Jerom again. He has not called except during my absence from my room for over two days. He gets lost or loses himself now and then. He will come along and report some day. He would get a shock if he found me gone. What becomes of him when he is lost I know not. No need to mention this to his family.</p>
<p>When in Cairo my mission was just a look round. In the car returning I was speaking an Englishman who is an officer in the Egyptian army. He told me that he came to a dance one evening when this Palace Hotel was in full swing. "The place was lighted to its full extent and reminded me and others of the tales from the Arabian nights stories." I can quite believe it. A fortune of a respectable size has been expended in metal lamps, &amp; when the electricity illuminates each one the whole must be magnificent.</p>
