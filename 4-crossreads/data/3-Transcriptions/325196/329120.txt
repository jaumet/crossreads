<p>19-2-16<br/>Sat 19th<br/>Kerosene has run out here  &amp; we cannot keep the lamp alight all night now &amp; it was brought in from the well last night; &amp; Smithers was on duty at a different post in the desert last night. This afternoon I went over to see the lads in B Troop. I went as guard to the transport with Sergt Doyle &amp; Charlie Burke, We took them over some bread for a change.</p>
<p>20-2-16<br/>Sun 20th<br/>Some gift goods were distributed today (sent by Mrs Vernon) I was not lucky enough to get any, had nothing to do today, but am on duty on mounted patrol tonight; Sutherland the despatch rider says we are likely to have a scrap within a few days, but probably a little higher up the river</p>
