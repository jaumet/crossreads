I went up to Alexandria for a few days last week with a Mr. & Mrs. Wood who were boarding here.  Mer. got three days leave & came too, except for the glimpse of the sea I like Cairo better but it is an interesting old city & I loved our visit to the old Roman Fort built sometime early in the 15th Century.  I see Professor Petrie is lecturing in London on Egyptian Tools 8000 B.C., one finds it difficult to grasp.Well I must close.  Very kind regards to the Major & with love for the Bairnies & Self.

I primarily started to send along all good wishes for Xmas & find I've left them out so please accept the very best.
