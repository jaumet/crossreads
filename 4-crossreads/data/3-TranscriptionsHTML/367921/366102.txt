<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   conversation with some of them out of the same regiment we casually mentioned that we were Colonials - in reply they stated that their regiment had been fighting against the Canadians at Lens and about 1J0 of them had gone over to give themselves up, but the Canadians had shown no mercy and had simply mowed them down with machine gun fire, not a man reaching the Canadian lines.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    We were kept in this unhealthy hole for a week and were then removed under escort to a camp at Burgsteinfurt, being some ten hours in the train, without refreshment of any kind, although our sentries got a feed at every big station we passed through.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Going through Dusseldorf we met a German Flying Officer who told us in excellent English that we had been very unfortunate in having been caught at the last post<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    We passed the best part of a week in a camp gaol on dry bread and a vile soup every alternate day and were then moved to Munster - being taken through the town to No l,Camp.<br/>Here we were kept in a reception room and through the sentry being bribed were allowed to receive English food, sent in by some of the "old stagers'' in the camp who knew what "clink'' diet was like.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The gaol here adjoined the compound in which the Belgian prisoners were kept.
