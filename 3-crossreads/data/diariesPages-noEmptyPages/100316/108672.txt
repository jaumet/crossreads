Yarned with Colonel Travers for a long time. Heard a furphy that Capt. Hunter had died of his wounds. This lacks confirmation as yet. Thewlis came down from the line first and one could see that he was tired out. I sent up a limber to bring out the captured M.g's. and other trophies. All the chaps came down very late and quite tired out with their experiences. Old Habel had a good dinner ready for them and they were soon all chattering about the number of Huns they had killed and all their experiences of blood. A frequent remark was on the callousness of many of the men. A rather critical situation was saved by Abercrombie and others on the left of A Co where their flank got well up in the air and some fainthearts started to go back. A bayonet sent after them persuading them that safety lay forward proved a good thing. Our star seems to have been Sergeant "Rusty" Ruthven whom I intend to recommend for a V.C. Madden is also said to have done good work. Smith was in charge of a limber full of machine guns which we sent down and we also brought out a minnen werfer gun.
Turned in after yarning with Matthews just as day broke
