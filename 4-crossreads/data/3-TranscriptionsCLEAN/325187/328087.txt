 Some of our Officers have been at a Cavalry School at  Zei[indecipherable]  while I was away-  They were told to trot their horses 8 miles an hour, never gallop as the instructors called a Canter the latter pace being unknown Attended Church Service- Am  w  reading C.N. & A.M. Williamson's book " It Happened in Egypt "   worth getting -  The wife was sent it be interested in it  Lovely weather & lovely sunsets it is a great change from the Summers.  On the Railway I noticed the same L.N.W.R. engine i.e. London & North Western Railway engines which pulled me about in England- these had been sent out for our Military line.
