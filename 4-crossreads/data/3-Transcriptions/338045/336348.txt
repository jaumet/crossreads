<p>has cleared &amp; a fine day. Receive leave pass from 1 pm to 9 pm &amp; spend the evening in London. My feelings are again being in this city are more than I imagined after all the days spent thinking of it out in France. A nice walk to Orpington station &amp; train journey to Charing Cross which I reach at 2 pm. Take the bus to Hdqrs, Horseferry Rd, &amp; here meet many of the old-boys. A walk around Strand, Westminster &amp; the Embankment, a few bus &amp; tube rides &amp; tea, taking the 7.30 pm back &amp; arrive in hospital at 8-45. Punctual on time. Tired &amp; sleep well.</p>
