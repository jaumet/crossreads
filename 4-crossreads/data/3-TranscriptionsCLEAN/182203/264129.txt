write like I use to in Egypt. The weather is too cold - my hand gets nearly frozen, if I try to write in bedroom & by or near a fire too much company to write. I'm very happy here, our men are all very good to us & seem to like me.Sister Kelly, who came on the "Kyarra" with me, arrived yesterday, so she is on our Staff now. She is an awfully nice girl & very pleased she has come, she also looks splendid. I believe she will be night Sister after me. We only do 4 weeks, so more than half my time is done. We have been very busy again with medical cases. Come by road convoy. (motor).
