24th January 1917 (Con) stack this afternoon. Good job none of us were on top. Most of our staff out today had narrow squeaks from shrapnel 5.9s lobbing near them. The Germans seem to have very crook ammunition a good many of their shells strike without bursting. I hope ?his? stock is all like the present ones. Did not do much after coming off at 10.
25th January 1917. Day opened very fine but cold. Went on duty at 6 oclock till 830. Fritz's artillery active today Some of his big shells were bursting over our position. Big pieces of shell came flying into our garden. I walked down "Cherry House" way did not venture too far that way for artillery fire. Walked to the town bought a few things. Went on duty again at 12.30 came off at 5. Didn't go out but went to bed to rest till 12 when I do the next shift of 2 hours.
