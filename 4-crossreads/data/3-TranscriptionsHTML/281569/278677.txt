<p>Revelli at 5.</p>
<p>3rd Regt arrived at 10/30 Romani.</p>
<p>R.F.C reports as follows Bir-el-Hamisah 2 new wells &ndash; Hod-el-Bayud 2-3 camels &ndash; Bir-el-Salmana many tracks into &amp; around Bir but no movement visible . Other places apparently clear.</p>
<p>Dismounted party of troops gone up to station as baggage guard &amp; leave at midnight. Tried out the pack horse for the morning &amp; he went OK so don't expect any trouble in that direction although starting in the morning there might be a different tale to tell. The Sig Sqdn took over our machines today &amp; were joy-riding to some tune. They intend to hand one gigger over to 2nd Sig Tp eventually.</p>
<p>Boys of troop getting a rough time at the Sqdn &amp; they are getting heaps of fatigues, turned in early on account of the early move. Bed at 8.</p>
<p>27 May, 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Revelli at 3</p>
<p>Moved out a three to the tune of a buckjumping display by Blitzen who finally dislodged the panniers, had a fair trip for the first two miles but the staff after that were up to putty they lost their way only twice, the desert was much the same as what we had been used to although as we got further out saltbush became more plentiful &amp; hares &amp; gazelles were also seen &amp; any amount of dead horses, camels etc. arrived at Romani at 0930 to find a lovely cool Hod of palms although in a frightful unsanitary state which we weren't long in starting on, the Sig Office is built on a open house principal &amp; is delightfully &amp; cool, our line board has nine lines including 3 vibrator, the first 12 hrs we handled 178 msg so can look for work in the next few days.</p>
<p>Bed at 11.30</p>
