<p>one used to play with turned into young men.<br/>Truly this military life is a dreadful waste of one's best years. After being here for twelve months I have developed very cynical ideas of military methods. I think anyone else who takes an intelligent interest in the workings of the battalion must soon adopt similar views. For instance since the last stunt, that is the Battle of Messines, numbers of privates have received promotions, and some have attained to the rank of officers, being raised from private to second lieutenant over the heads of some of the old sergeants who were<br/>with the battalion in Australia.<br/> This could be understood if the new officers had shown any particular talents but most of them are inferior to the sergeants whom they have superceded. Again times out of number from new reinforcements who have never been in action are promoted before intelligent men in our own ranks who have been through the whole chapter. Nevertheless any man in the infantry with any brains or ambition soon receives promotion; after any of the advances, as the casualties amongst non-coms. are very heavy; that is, of course, provided he is lucky enough to come through safely himself.<br/> There are very few of the original battalion here now who have not at least one stripe, and many who landed as privates are now officers. On the other hand there are very few of them left now as, outside of killed or wounded, many have been transferred to different units.<br/> There must be a shortage of officers as anyone who is recommended  and gets chosen for the Officers School receives his commission provided he is of good behaviour during his term of training there. I have this information from many of the men who have returned form the School as Officers. Some of them have a very slight idea of drill or tactics.</p>
