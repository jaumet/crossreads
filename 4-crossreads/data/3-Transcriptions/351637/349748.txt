These originals have been paid for in the general account, and Angus &amp; Robertson's agent, in London - Mr. George - has an order from Bartlett addressed to the Manager of the Eastern Telegraph Company, asking him to hand over to Mr. George these documents on the termination of the War.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The papers in our Records also show copies of letters from Bartlett to the Postmaster General and a reply thereon that the documents will be kept by the Manager of the Eastern Telegraph Company and handed over at the proper time. I wrote to Angus and Robertson to-day, reminding them that 'these documents are still due and asking them to remind their agent in London so that he would not overlook it.</p>
