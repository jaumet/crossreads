and were soon tucked in bed in the forward saloon which was fitted up as a big ward. All appliances and conveniences seemed to be at hand and there was a large staff of doctors, nurses and orderlies, all the latter appearing to be men unfit for front line work.The voyage across the channel was made without incident although the fog made it somewhat longer than usual. I have no recollection of any motion of the vessel and think it was a calm passage. The dressing was done at intervals.It was dark next evening when we came alongside at Portsmouth and I much envied the walking cases who had been on deck seeing things as we came up the harbour. The ticket pinned to me at this time marked "serious" so was one of the last to be carried to the hospital train close by. Previously a staff officer had come around the wards asking officers whether they wished to go to any particular hospital in England and tho' no choice was allowed the A.I.F. officers, most of the Imperial people seemed to have their tickets marked according to their wish.Travelling was infinitely more comfortable than on the French railways and we went through to London at express speed. A doctor and regular army nurse wearing the King's and Queen's South African ribbons did rounds and attended to needful cases. A good hot cup of tea and biscuits were brought round soon after we were well on the way. Waterloo station was reached after midnight and here a big convoy of ambulances and stretcher bearers were waiting. Four stretchers were loaded on one car and a V.A.D. was told off to watch me during the journey. I was supposed to be rather bad and was in fact feeling a bit done after the travelling. I remember she sprinkled eau-de-cologne on my forehead and handkerchief, a proceeding which somehow called to mind that it was Olive's Birthday. I wished that she had been in the place of the V.A.D., but would like to know who the latter lady was so as to thank her for the attention given me that night. Very little was to be seen through the back of the ambulance on the way up to Wandsworth. All lights were sheltered and the deserted London streets almost in darkness, but we went at a good pace until the V.A.D. made the driver go slower on account of the lurching and jolting.About 2 am on 20th November we reached No.3 London General Hospital at Wandsworth where the well-known night matron "Sister Susie" (Sister Sanders) accompanied the stretcher to "I" ward where I was destined to spend the next 2 months. The transfer from stretcher to bed was effected with a feeling of infinite relief that the travelling was at an end and I was at last safely settled in England.
