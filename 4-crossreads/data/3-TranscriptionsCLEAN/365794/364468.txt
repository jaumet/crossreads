  
 Thursday 8 March 1917 [7 March 1918] 1/2 day & went town, met Sisters Henry & O'B., tea Liptons & we air our little woes. At 9 a.m. went to Cairo cemetery with S. Witherington & took a photo of "F. Green" grave, also Norman Mowbray.  Capts. Grant & Collins came in with us to Cairo. Took snap of our lettuce being washed in the old Nile on the way home & very picturesque & dirty it was.
