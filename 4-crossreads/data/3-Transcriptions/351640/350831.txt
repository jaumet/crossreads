<p>got a little out of order,   We had to slow down during the repairs but soon regained our position in the fleet.</p>
<p>This morning the 20th, we passed the Maldive Islands and are now wending our way through the Arabian Sea.   It is a beautiful day, fairly cool with a calm sea.  Flying fish are plentiful.   Rumours of trouble are again becoming prevalent this time with the Turks, when we reach the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>I must now describe an exciting little experience which occurred this morning, the 21st at about 4 30 o'clock.  Everyone was awakened by what appeared to be a collision, and on rushing out on deck from my cabin, my first impression proved to be only too true, our line of ships composed the Euripides, Argylshire, Shropshire, Ascanius and Benalla, and for some unknown reason, though many rumours are current, our vessel ran right up to and severely bumped the Shropshire, about a quarter broadside on, and in endeavouring to get out of this grave position, another bump was experienced   The result meant very little to the Shropshire, but tore a hole in our ship about 20 feet long, and about 4 inches in width.  Alarm bells and even distress signals and sky rockets could be heard and seen.   It was exceedingly dark, and a fair sea running.   The consternation on board can be better imagined than than described.   The conduct of the Officers, and the troops has been the subject of very warm compliments from all quarters   The men behaved positively heroically; put on their life belts and moved quietly to their allotted places, where they remained perfectly calm and, untill an hour or more later, when it was ascertained that the damage was not of sufficient importance to cause immediate alarm.   This aspect was not known to the men, and untill they were actually dismissed, they did not know at what moment they might be ordered to jump over board and swim clear of a sinking ship and await rescue.   Many terror stricken faces were apparent, but there was not one case of outward fear or cowardice.   The Ascanius, I understand had been adjudged unworthy of negotiating the Red Sea, and is to be put in at Aden for repairs.  This incident of the collision will probably form a Naval Enquiry later on, when probably you will</p>
