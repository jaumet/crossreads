March 1
Crop. Peter, Otto and myself paraded before Major Moseley this morning asking for permission to transfer and he agreed to recommend us. Peter & Otto have since drawn out and Bob and Jack Dexter are going to parade in the morning asking to be substituted in their places. We are having very strenuous physical exercises every morning. Pain this afternoon.

March 2
Awfully oppressive day. Been erecting a cook-house all day with Austin Davis. Bob and Jack paraded for their transfers this morning and were recommended. Had beautiful bath tonight.

March 3
Hot and windy again today.
Nothing doing. Erecting tents mostly.

March 4
Holiday today to make up for half holiday missed on Wednesday. Nothing so far about our transfers. Sgt Black acting W.O. I have been promised a stripe here with probable chance of more if I stay.
