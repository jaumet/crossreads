<p>another for some time.  We got our 40 frcs pay today so have been able to indulge in some tin fruit etc.  Dont let Bruce come to the war in too much of a hurry, its all right soldiering from Sydney and England but things change over here.  Excuse me to any relations that havenetreceived expected letters from me as writing is difficult.  Give my love &amp; kisses to all &amp; whips to yourself.</p>
