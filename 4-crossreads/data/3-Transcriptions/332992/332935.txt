<p>Wednesday May 2. 1917<br/>A beautiful morning, but there is a haziness in the air which makes visibility not so wide &amp; clear as our airmen would like.  Our Batteries are continually shifting their position &amp; it is well, for Fritz has been reaching for one with H.E. shells, dropping them in a line parallel to our store, &amp; on the old battery site.  Up to 10 O'clock he must have put over 150 shells, a large percentage "duds", and all for nothing so far, and costing the enemy over &pound;1000 for shells.  At the time of writing he is still shelling, schrapnel from the bursting shells coming quite close to our billets.  When I was shaving I saw a company of soldiers narrowly escape being hit with a shell.  It burst in front of them, they ran across, when a "dud" fell behind them.<br/>Other companies made a wide detour.  The concussion from the bursting shells shake our stores &amp; rooms.</p>
<p>I heard last night the Jack Brake is in the 30 artillery near here.<br/>This evening I examined the shell holes made by Fritz this morning &amp; saw hundreds of shell fragments lying about.  I recovered a few for souvenirs.  A Tommy was killed about 10 chains from our stores by shells this morning.</p>
