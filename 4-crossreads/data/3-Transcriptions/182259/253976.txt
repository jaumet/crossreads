<p>....... fell out sore footed &amp; tired on the road back to camp</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (17)</p>
<p>Ap 24th&nbsp; We were warned to go to France that night so we had a busy day preparing. We were marched to the station headed by the&nbsp; Dept Band. We were given hot cocoa &amp; pudding at the station, and extrained at 10pm. We had a few hours rest and a good hot breakfast at folkestone.</p>
<p>Apr 25th We crossed the channell to&nbsp;<s> Bollgne Bologne</s> Boulogne. It was very cold crossing but the trip was done under two hours, life&nbsp; belts had to be worn on&nbsp; account of submarine dangers,arriving at Boulogne we had a big hill to climb, christened and well known by the soldiers as Blanket Hill. as we had our pack and two blankets to carry and I can assure you they felt like six before one reaches the top.</p>
<p>26th&nbsp; As there was a shortage of sail transport, we started about about 10am on a march to the Aust Base at Elaples , a distance of about 20 mile, carrying our pack &amp; blankets, The first seven mile the road was very hilly. We reached the camp at 7pm or at least some of us did others were picked up along the road by lorries etc.</p>
