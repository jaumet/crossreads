<p>1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 2 &nbsp; JUNE</p>
<p>A beautiful calm warm day. The first decent day we have had, I was on bosuns fatigue ie swabbing decks, but Bill Hunter &amp; Self were not wanted so we lay in sun all day &nbsp;We are due at Durban tomorrow &amp; there is great speculation as to our Chances of getting ashore. Had a life belt parade in afternoon. Our brigade were ready in about 8 minutes but I got up in 1 minute &amp; I bet I halve that if a torpedo hits us. Went to bed full of expectations as to our landing at Durban</p>
