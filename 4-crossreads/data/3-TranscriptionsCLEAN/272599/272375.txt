  
 1917 Saturday 14 April 
 Sanitation duties today. The 3rd Field are terrors for work we have breakfast immediately after parade, then to work at 8 a.m. till 12 noon. 1.00 pm to 4 & often after tea more jobs. Tucker is very scarce too the difficulty of getting up sufficient supplies from Albert being the cause.   Bully & biscuits our main stay when everything else fails. Fritz has an immense cemetry up in the village.   Hundreds being buried there.   He keeps the graves very nicely & each has a large wooden cross, with name, age etc fully printed thereon.   Two graves of "Englanders" well kept too one with 2 wreathes on it.
