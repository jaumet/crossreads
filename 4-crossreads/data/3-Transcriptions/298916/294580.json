<p>whole class would disband. (It turned out that the Navy had made no terms at all so far).<br/>Terms soon came to hand &amp; were:- &pound;2/-/- per week. 12 hrs a day &amp; a warrant officer's position. After some discussion over the 12 hrs a day it was agreed to accept them. The money, although less than expected, did not "stick" at all, as we were all agreed to accept as low as 30/- per week if necessary, but the long hours, were the cause of well founded anxiety, as wireless operating under war conditions is totally different from peace times. Too much of it is likely to cause nervous breakdown with the corresponding risk to those depending on the operator. However we agreed &amp; from then, one by one we were drafted out, as the transports were ready to leave.</p>
<p>One case in particular may be noted.<br/>A scholar (not an outsider) of the Marconi Coy joined the troopship class. For convenience we shall call him 'X". Well, naturally enough "X" was given the preference to the remainder &amp; was drafted to the Orvieto &ndash; the convoy's flagship. "X" could only operate at twelve words &amp; even then was not too steady. As before stated, it was not his fault but later on it will be shown what effect it had in the convoy.</p>
