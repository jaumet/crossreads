<p>Empire Day, 1915.</p>
<p>Dear Home Folk, &amp; Farmer Whyte &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>The Turks asked for an armistice to-day to bury the dead. It was granted them, so from 7 a.m. to-day we had a delicious period of quiet. I watched them burying the dead for an hour or two. It was a gruesome business. One of our chaps said &quot;I dont mind shooting them, but I <s>bar</s> hate burying them&quot;.</p>
<p>I went and had a delightful swim in the Aegean Sea, just about a dozen miles north of the Hellespont. We are now back in the trenches, and the music had begun once more. I&#39;m ashamed to admit, I&#39;ve not had a shave for over a week - Who&#39;d like to kiss me now? Don&#39;t all speak at once.</p>
<p>Hundreds of our fellows were swimming to-day, enjoying themselves hugely, and laughing and joking all the while. One Light Horseman just out of the trenches collared one of the transport mules from an Indian and rode along the beach shouting &quot;Who said there was a War on?&quot;</p>
<p>Two seconds ago a big shrapnel shell burst right in front of our dugout. The bullets flew everywhere, but I dont see anyone injured. We all bolted to the shelter. I got in first. There is a quite a connonade going on now. I guessed the clam of the day presaged a storm.</p>
<p>25.5.&#39;15. Just as I walked out of my dug-out this morning two men were shot by a machine gun not 10 yards off - one in the shoulder and one in the eye - not dangerously. It is just a week since I first set foot on Gallipolo peninsular. It has been the most wonderful week in my life - full of excitement and hair breadth escapes. I&#39;ve had enough thrills to last me a life time. You&#39;d hardly believe the fun we get out of the whole show. Something funny is always happening. The men are in excellent health and spirits, but each respite they get they all go hunting small game. So far I&#39;ve escaped. But I&#39;ve had two baths in the sea. The climate is perfect here. The hillside is covered with wild holly and wild flowers like wattle, also lilac flowers and pink ones. I&#39;m in excellent health. If there is any chance I&#39;ll send this letter. Estimated Turks lost 2,000 killed and 5,000 wounded in their attack on our trenches on 18th and 19th May.</p>
<p>Farmer Whyte may lick this into shape for Bluegum. Good luck.</p>
<p>OL.</p>
