asked me about The Lady, and I answered "Oh Yess. She's rather a nice Girl." Where did she come from? queried R.G.A. I told Aussie, and when we got inside pointed her out, Tommy was quite taken by Surprise, he thought I had been pulling his leg. but when he saw the Leading Lady, all his doubts vanished Now I must go. Heaps of love to all. and a Special Share for Yourself and Bett from your Loving Son. Chas. G.
