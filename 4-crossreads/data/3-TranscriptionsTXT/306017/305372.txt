go back.  We left by train at 10.30 am & got back to Hill 70 at 8 pm.
19th October to 27thGot back to the same old routine  stables exercising horses every day.  An easy time but very slow.  It took me 2 days to get over my trip, during those 2 days I had long lapses of forgetfulness wasn't living on the desert at all!  Another party went to Alex on the 19th followed by others on the 21st & the 23rd.  I believe no more are to go after the 23rd lot.  However leave is still being granted to Port Said but it is a dingy slow place & little better than being in camp.
Jack Cheater the SQM went on leave & I took over his duties.  There is only about 2 hrs work to do each day & you are practically your own boss.  It is the softest job I have had & I only wish it would last.  An Austln mail came in on the 23rd & I got 2 letters one from home & the other from Doug.  Having plenty of time I got the bulk of my correspondence
