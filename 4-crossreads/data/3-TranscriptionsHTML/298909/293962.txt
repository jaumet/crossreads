<p>the enemy outposts, were engaged here a few days ago, with only a few casualtys to our men. Here we have anti Air Craft Guns constantly on the lookout &amp; well manned. The Water is turned on at fixed hours &amp; then there is rush, as a man is allowed a water bottle ful per day to drink &ndash; clean dishes &ndash; Teeth etc. Without a bit of exaggeration you can see daily a string of men &frac14; of mile long waiting for the Bar &amp; the Canteen to open. There is no hope of us getting into L.H.F.A., so we expect to be pushed into Field Ambulance Units. This place is all entrenched &ndash; wire entanglements etc. It is near where the Turks tried to rush the Canal after carrying galvanized iron boats across the Desert, these boats were riddled with shot &amp; are now to be seen in Cairo at the Zoological Gardens. The sand here is very fine &amp; white, so it is not too pleasant with the wind &amp; traffic.</p>
<p>I brought a Billy Can from Telekebar &amp; of course they all said I was balmy, an old dog for a hard road, all our Tent had cocoa &amp; Biscuits before going to bed, then they appreciated the Billy.</p>
