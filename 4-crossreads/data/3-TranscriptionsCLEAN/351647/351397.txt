 Dear Mrs. Jack, 
 A couple of letters from you the last few days, 26 & 29 I think.  Both little ones, you weren't too good & it was awfully sweet of you to write when you simply could not have felt much like it. 
 I'm so sorry you were off colour & had to have another op.  They are such rotten things & you must have had a good deal of pain too.  I hope you are quite all right again now.  I hate to think of you laid up, you always seem to think of you as a creature of life & movement.  You know you people are most awfully good to me, the way you write & the things you say & send, and really I don't deserve it all.  When I think of the growling narky old pig I used to be at times, I simply feel sick especially when your unfailing letter arrives, cheering & entertaining.  But I will try & be better & nicer.  I feel as if there was absolutely nothing I wouldn't do. 
 I haven't written lately much, I couldn't without
