  
 Sunday  20-1-17 Attended Mass today in the Village church (Meaulte).  Was also let in for Benediction.  Only about 6 Civilians in the church altogether & they were [sentence not finished] Thursday  24-1-17 3 days of clear Sunshine but cold as cold.  Several Cylinders burst in Engine room.  Baths put out of service by burst pump.  All due to intense cold.  Duck Boards like a skating rink.  Road dusty & hard as steel.  A Taube came over at Midnight & dropped a few Bombs.  The Search lights were trying to pick him up without much success.  It is so cold that when we are working, the nails freeze to our fingers.  Had a Slide today after getting paid. 
 Sunday  27-1-17 Smashed another Finger yesterday.  Blizzard today.
