<p>St. Omer 24/10/16  At 2.30 pm the column moved off and in light rain we swung over to the main road.  Some drunks but not very many.  Halted outside several little villages and near St. Maertin we had tea after which the transport moved on.  Here we talked to some children who showed us a granite column erected on the scene of a battle fought between Bayard and Charles Temeraire.  The men sang choruses and some very ribald songs while waiting.  Continuing the march we skirted the outside of St. Omer and came up to the station.  Women and kids came up calling out "Chocolat, Boulli beef, zaq a zaq&pound;&pound;&pound;&pound;&pound;&pound;&pound;&pound;&pound;"  The train consisted of carriages for 700 men and the balance comprised of the usual trucks some of which were in a filthy condition and not fit to put men in.  Our movement order provides for an arrival at Longpre at 4 am travelling all night via Abbeville and Etaples.  The canal system hereabouts is elaborate and connects up with railways.  We questioned a lad about his homelife.  He was of the average class and had his primary school certificate and a good knowledge of mathematics and geography.  His father was conscripted and works in the coal mines of La Bassee. They were refugees to St. Omer and only had meat once a week generally on Sundays &ndash; either fowl or rabbit.  About every second Sunday they have snails or frogs for dinner.  These they get from an old man who catches them in the surrounding marshes.  They also eat horseflesh sometimes.  We pulled out of St. Omer about 10.30 pm and ran on in the darkness all night.  It was miserable crouched up on the seats and got extremely cold towards dawn.</p>
