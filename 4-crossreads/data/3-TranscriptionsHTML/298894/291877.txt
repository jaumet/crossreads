<p>Sunday 7th Feb. Leg still bad, was visited during afternoon by Syd Morris, Mrs Carver and Jim Murphy so was comforted some<br/>8th 9th &amp; 10th Leg very bad could not walk had to be carried to Latrines etc. Was kept busy however completing nominal rolls pay books and attestation papers preparatory to sailing. Had mother to visit me as I could not go home.<br/>Thursday night father mother Syd &amp; Ian came to say good-bye as I was to sail next day Mum bore up bravely &amp; said goodbye like a Spartan.<br/>Friday morning came at last &amp; I hired a taxi to take me to the boat taking a fellow with me. After calling at the bank for our pay and buying some films I arrived at the boat to find Dad &amp; Syd there to say a last goodbye, The troops were just arriving from Liverpool &amp; looked an imposing sight. At first I feared that I might be turned back owing to my leg but I was allowed to go on but received a lot of chaff from my fellows about being wounded already. The Slany Bee left the wharf first to the accompaniment of great cheers singing etc. the public being allowed on the wharf just as she moved off. We followed shortly after with the band playing various national airs, Tipperary Auld Lang Syne etc. Instead of following the Bee out we anchored for an hour &amp; then left the harbour for Brisbane much to our astonishment as we thought we were going</p>
