<p>billet is. The country people in the locality are quite different from those on the Somme. We are now in Flanders and about 30 kiloms. from the Belgian frontiers. The people are very fair in appearance and all speak the guttural Flemish language (&amp; probably German also) in addition to French which is never used when speaking among themselves &ndash; in fact I believe that many old people cannot speak French at all. With a mixed Belgian, Flemish &amp; French population there are plenty of spies about and captures often take place among the civilians. At present I am in charge of the admitting &amp; evacuating of all sick from surrounding Units &ndash; we are too far back to get wounded. Yesterday took a convoy of patients over to Arques &amp; St Omer. The last time I was on St Omer was when I biked over from No 2 G. H. at Winereux &ndash; 54 kilometres by road.</p>
