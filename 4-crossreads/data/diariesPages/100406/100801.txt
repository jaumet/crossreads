Before the war a boy had to deposit 100 Francs to join the Boy Scouts in Belgium. After 3 years service this sum was refunded.

Marcinelle is the name of this suburb. Wrote to the Agent General last night. Terrible "Purfies" floating around about sandbaggers etc. Charleroi out of bounds after tonight.

Had another trip to Waterloo yesterday. Travelled by Train from Charleroi to Braine-L?Alleud. We had a very wet trip. The train took 3H.10Min. on the return journey (about 37 K.M.) it was as usual crowded. I sent some Cards to Mum, Ciss Mollie while from the Waterloo P.O.
On Monday last there was a demonstration in Charleroi to celebrate the inauguration of the Eight Hour day on the Belgian Railways. Just now the miners are on strike for an Eight hour day also. Formerly the Belgian Railway Employees worked 12 hours per day.
Charleroi was only out of Bounds for 48 Hours, Sunday midnight till midnight on Tuesday. I don't think they caught many strays.
Friday, 7-3
Battalion Gaurd today.

Finis Gaurd, thank God. The people here obtain water from stand pipes in the street. These stand pipes are operated by a Box Spanner and the water only flows while you hold the spanner. I discovered a lady chess player here, Miss Murray-Prior. She plays well, beat me 2 games
