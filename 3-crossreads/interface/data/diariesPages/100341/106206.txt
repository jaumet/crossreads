en route. Took photo of our ?Straglers Transport? and when within about 2 miles of destination had to leave donkeys and put our gear on Transport Camels. Later on various units separating had to unload waited for return of empty camels which I hired for use of our party. While waiting in open sands caught in very heavy storm getting well nigh soaked, reached camp site about 3pm. found tents up so sorted ourselves out parted. Night's sleep much appreciated.
Fine Anniversary Day.
