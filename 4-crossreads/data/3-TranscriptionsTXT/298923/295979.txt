 28 December 1918 Saturday Gen Chauvel inspected us today &amp; said he hoped we would commence being demobilised soon-   He avoided the BEDOUIN massacre- it was wonderful how well the men turned out considering their spree- The Band had no Band Master &amp; let themselves go the tune was awful- Alls well, but I am hungering to get home With love to you all Frank
