There is no doubt that the 5th Brigade is in some particularly difficult position, for their casualties are out of proportion to other Anzac Units in France.  It may be coincidence, but I think it is a case of "good Brigade &ndash; important post" 
 Yours sincerely, Wm. J. Sherbon We had news this am. that 7 N.C.O's &amp; men of 20th who had been reported 'missing', are now  "unofficially"  (?) known to be Prisoners of War.
