 Monday 6 March 1916 
 A fine bright day throughout. 
 Our company was detailed for a fortnight's duty as Cairo piquet, practically all the able-bodied men &amp; officers with the exception of myself going. We were up early getting ready for the departure by 8 o'clock. 
 During the day was kept busy getting the mess left by the men properly straightened up, seeing abt the transfer of abt a dozen men to us from another company, censoring letters etc. 
 Tuesday 7 March 1916 
 A fine day, hot in the sun. before breakfast was kept going looking after company matters, there being only 4 men for parade. 
 At the forenoon parade lunch was carried &amp; we all marched out into the desert 2 or 3 miles, spending the day at certain manoeuvres with a break for lunch, marching back to camp abt 3 o'clock, being quite hot &amp; tired by the time we reached it. 
 A new company, the 14th Rfls of 4th Battn., arrived just abt "Lights Out", 3 of the officers coming to our tent. 
 Wednesday 8 March 1916 
 A fine sunny day but a pleasant northerly breeze blowing all day. 
 Just as I abt to go out on parade I was wanted &amp; on going out found Jocelyn who had arrived with the reinforcements by night. He is back again at B Details, Feitoun. Was delighted to see him &amp; only sorry time was so limited. Took lunch &amp; spent the day out in the desert as yesterday. One of the 3 officers taken to hospital with mumps.
