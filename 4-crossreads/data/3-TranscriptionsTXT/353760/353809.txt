 January 3 72. He was on our first sick parade, and he came into the dressing room mufflered and overcoated, and his hands deep in his pockets, of his left hand his third finger was half septic and his fourth had a great festering sore round the nail.  His face is a death mask of a man dead after years of wasting, and years of terrible anguish, his cheeks are sunken and his eyes, his nose sensitive, and over his lips a deep black moustache, his hat is well over his forehead.  Never a word he says, and always &ndash; except when he is actually being dressed, his hands are always in his pockets.  When the M.O. ordered his going to the D.R.S. to have his finger lanced, the last of his vitality seemed to go, and all fear was in its place.  Three times a day he suddenly appears without notice in the Dressing Room and brings with him always his air of haunting. 
 73. Frank D. to the Kookaburras last night and put in some good cartoon sketchings. 
 January 3, 4 74. Mail:  "The Wild Swans at Coole", W.B. Yeats new book. 
 An argument with Bill F. that ended disastrously &ndash; the Art of Augustus Johns, for reproduction in sepia in The 'Sketch' &ndash; in 'Tatler, I forget which. 
 75. Going down to hut from D.R.  from  for Rhum issue with Toby across the deep sky the most wounderful streaked line of pure white rushing light &ndash; as brilliant and large as a flare:  a frosty clear night with bright stars. 
 January 4 76. Mail:  one solitary home letter from Mother, Nov. 4, so all letters since Oct. 12 missing.  Bag not yet arrived from Jays:  wish I could remember if it was after buying the bag or before, I bought the two Cuala books and the Bound books, at any rate with the bag will be Lord Dunsany's book of Plays and a book of William Watson's.  'I bought you Dennis' last book which I hope you will like:  I must confess I couldn't make much sense out of it:  however I knew you love poetry, so hope it will give you a happy hour or two'.  What a delightful flattering of the Muse.
