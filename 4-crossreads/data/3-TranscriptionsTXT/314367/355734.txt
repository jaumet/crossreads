About 5 pm I went to the Warrego to see a sick man & saw two officers I knew & asked them to climb Die Mutter in the morning with me.  They said yes - Right oh - I'll call for you at 5.45 am tomorrow morning - Right -
I went off to the Fantome quite happy & told the sickly girl blighters - We put in a good evening - 2 card tables & guests & all very jolly - My fellow countryman - Nelson of Norfolk said he'd climb Die Mutter with me -To climb Die Mutter you must be sound in wind & limb - It's just physical drill in a hot climate & Officers should be ready to do this sort of thing -Sunday Jan 31-15 - I had got all ready & was up at 5.30 - Called Nelson - Dressed - Shirt - Boots pants - hat - a drink of water & a bite of a corned beef sandwich - Boat ready & we went to the Warrego - Got Gordon & Baker - both hard goers & then to the pier - Start at 6 am - Up hill to the Hospital & then by a narrow track thro virgin jungle - then track got lost & we went up a gully - It was hot & steamy - I advised getting on the ridges & climbing up them - This we did & by 8 am
