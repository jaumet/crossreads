 we moved up to the front line as a working party to dig a communication trench. We  moved  trod cautiously across fields, hills, dales; most of the ground being broken by shellfire, holes, trenches, and battered roads, and encumbered with barbed-wire. Our 18 pounders were firing in a desultory fashion, and I heard the occasional growl of enemy artillery. This was my first night under regular gun fire: my feelings were those of curiosity and fear; but I was calm and master of myself, and, like most other men, did not allow myself to degenerate into what the boys, in their forcible language, call "a windy bastard". Most strange and weird appeared the lights and flares emitted from the enemy's line. Trails of light streaked the sky, almost continuously and these streaks,  burst  on reaching their apexes, burst into bright stars of white light which, falling slowly back to earth, brilliantly illuminated the neighbourhood for five minutes at a time. Occasionally red flares shot through the sky, and sometimes a succession of lights, * resembling a string of beads, rose slowly skyward. Behind all these   coruscations the piercing rays of German searchlights fidgeted about the clouds. The whole line in this sector was  illuminated  lighted like George Street, Sydney, on a Friday night.
