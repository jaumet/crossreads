 It was long in reaching us, &amp; it happens to be the only one signed with his full name &ndash; 
 We only got one or two letter cards before, signed "Arthur". 
 We are wondering how he died, probably went into action just after, or a shell may have found their trench! 
 I hope the thought of his bravery &amp; his duty done, will help you both to bear up bravely also, in this time of trouble &amp; sorrow. 
 Your loving sister F. Ferguson
