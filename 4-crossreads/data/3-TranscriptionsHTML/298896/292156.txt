<p>alongside for a landing ground &amp; refilling point. Over 20 planes were down at once, Camel scouts, &amp; were going &amp; coming all day each being fitted with 4 &ndash; 25 lb bombs. The major in charge is supposed to be our leading airman with 54 to his credit. One going up during the afternoon tried to twin too soon &amp; struck the ground with his wing &amp; crashed, smashing up the plane. The pilot received a shaking only. Orders through tonight for us to move at 6 A.M. in the morning for Cappy. Visited Harbonnieres &amp; saw a large cemetery containing French German &amp; our own graves. A certain amount of satisfaction is gained by seeing so many German graves.</p>
