<p>Aug. 23.1919<br/>At noon Lat. 30.46 S, <strike>16</strike> 83.29 E.  Distance from Port Natal 2723 miles, to Fremantle 1654 miles.  Complaints from some of the wives re amongst themselves injuries held by the Transports Commanders, the Commanding officer of troops &amp; adjutant re same ended as usual.  Simply a silly misunderstanding amongst various women in the same cabin, great fuss made over nothing, otherwise every one contented &amp; happy yet anxious to reach Fremantle as in these Latitudes there is always a heavy sly. &amp; SWly [south-westerly] swell which makes every ship roul heavily &amp; consequently uncomfortable.  At meals whilst dinning often when rouling heavily chairs &amp; crockery slide off the tables &amp; food stuff spilt &amp; spoilt.  A whist drive was held amongst the troops &amp; their wives tonight.  We passed a steamer close this night the 1st seen since we left Port Natal.  We are in Daily communication with the Ulssyses, Orsova, War Earl, War Syren, War Admiral, Clan McArthur &amp; Chimitz.  The former being 750 miles south of us in Lat. 41 S &amp; the Orsova in Lat. 36, 320 miles south both transports having no doubt far worse weather &amp; rouling far heavier than us being so far south, yet they shorten the distance from Port Natal to Fremantle by going on the Great Circle Track.  The 1st Saloon Orcestra string band had a argument amongst themselves so the result being music whilst dinning in the 1st Saloon is suspended temporary so that with all the minor complaints aboard some are far worse than Children.  Red Cross &amp; Y.M.C.A. issued tobacco &amp; cigarettes &amp; chocolate &amp; clothing to the troops.  We have increased our speed as per orders from Perth by wireless</p>
