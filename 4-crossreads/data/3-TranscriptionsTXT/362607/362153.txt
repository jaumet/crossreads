Dad always talked of Sulby Glen Marie  &  I rode to the bottom on Sulby side   &  rode  & walked  right to the top of Snaefell. It was a glorious day   &  we had a lovely time although it was rather severe on Marie who is only a girl after all. The view was lovely & thought of riding to Ramsey  & back that way but we tossed for it as it was late   & we came back Sulby Way. Dad will perhaps remember Tholt-e-Will on the way down. The Glen Waterfall half way house was closed so we had to wend our way round the high road  & it was pretty rough through being so little used since the war started. We had Tea in the Village on the way Home  &  were very tired when we arrived home.
