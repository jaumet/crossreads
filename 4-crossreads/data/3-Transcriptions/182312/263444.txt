<p>on the walls of which was not hung a large map of the Western Front</p>
<p>well covered with pencil marks shewing the progress of operations.</p>
<p>They seem to recognise that this war will be decided on the battle-</p>
<p>fields of France and that they are there merely in a helping</p>
<p>capacity, to see that the Army gets its reinforcements, munitions</p>
<p>and stores without hindrance.&nbsp; On the question of whether the</p>
<p>German Fleet will ever come out in force and fight, their opinions</p>
<p>are divided, but one and all agree that the men of the German Navy</p>
<p>are willing and anxious to fight and of course nothing would please</p>
<p>our men more than to give them a chance to prove their skill.&nbsp; At</p>
<p>Jutland and elsewhere they shewed that they were no mean enemy;</p>
<p>their tactics were good and their gunnery was good, a specialty in</p>
<p>the latter being their rapid big gun fire.&nbsp; But Jutland has been of</p>
<p>immense value to us.&nbsp; It has shewn us our weak points and we have</p>
<p>been able to make such structural alterations to our ships as should</p>
<p>in the future more than compensate us for the losses sustained at</p>
<p>Jutland.&nbsp; Simple enough they seem, but still it needed a big engage-</p>
<p>ment to make the apparent and the Navy is ever open to learn.</p>
<p>Should a big encounter ever take place again we must expect to lose</p>
<p>ships for we must fight the German when and where he pleases.&nbsp; He</p>
<p>won&#39;t come out boldly into the open but will make a sort of running</p>
<p>fight of it, if possible in thick weather, with a possible object of</p>
<p>dragging us over a prepared mine field or into some such trap.&nbsp; But</p>
<p>our chaps will take all this into account and give him battle on</p>
<p>whatever terms he likes - anything to get at him.&nbsp; Meantime he will</p>
<p>make his occasional small raids in the Channel and North Sea and</p>
<p>will catch a shop of ours now and then, but these little affairs</p>
<p>should cause no concern, they are merely the price of our Sea</p>
<p>Supremacy.&nbsp; The Navy is surprised at the infrequency of these</p>
