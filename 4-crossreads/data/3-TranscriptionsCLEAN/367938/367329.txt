  
 fellows here one knows of, tho' dont often meet. The valley & beach is just like a small city with paths full of men going on their various business - or getting in the way. One knows others by sight as you do in a Sydney crowd. Sheltered spots from the enemy shells are like a crowd debouching from a ferry boat on the quay. 
  TRUE  While the German & Turkish Officers were parleying with our general staff before the Armistice - a man's head appeared from below (all on slopes) & looking in to the dug out said "Oh you're the - coves what stole my quart are you" & reached out for it! 
 Rumours are less in fashion now but some funny ones are thought out still - An aeroplane is just overhead. I shld. like to see another 12 000 men on top of that number wh. has just arrived in Egypt. The taking of [Achi Baba] seems to be the turning point that will first make itself felt - I hope its done before the winter cold sets in. I don't believe we'll see Constantinople after they've given in & I'm very anxious to: there's too many of us. 
 Mail closes soon & there's young Keyes of Muswellbrook come to give night cossack post report - so will end with love to all & regrets that there's nothing to write about.
