After a   quilt quiet night with only intermittent firing we take   a stock of the positionOur trenches are on the ridge *   &  the Turks are on a ridge opposite about 200 yds away   &  the valley in between is covered with dead bodies of Australians and Turks. At other parts the distance between the Turks   &  us is only from 15 to 30 yds   &  at night both parties throw hand bombs into each others defences* Pope's Hill

At daylight the 13th are called out to support the 15ths positions * (who lost heavily in a futile charge during the night) but were not required. While we were near their trenches the wounded kept coming down in all stages of mutilation, Heads shot off, faces smashed   &  bullet holes in almost every possible place. the sight was shocking.* Quinn's Post.
