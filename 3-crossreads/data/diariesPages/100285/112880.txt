A big batch of men came in to the O.T.B. from "Hurdcott" today.
31st. Have got a slight cold in my head the first I have had for ages, they are complaints I seldom suffer from at any time.
Well I went over to the OTB on the off chance of seeing Len this afternoon I thought there might have been the luck for the telegram which I sent last night to get through in time for him to catch the 10.15 from Paddington, he got the wire as a matter of fact the same night at 11.30 came down to Paddington thinking his train left at 10.35 so missed it, he then wired on to Chunder the Adjutant that he would be down by the 12.27 which he caught, I went down to Warminster we had some tea in a little joint before the train left.
