Our Skipper has just received a wireless message from the Admiralty thanking him for his Seamanship in bringing us through the storm at one time we were drifting very near to the French Coast-It is calmer today but a very high sea running.The Ship's order O.C. Troops thanked the men who worked in the stoke hold baleing all night & then Captain of the day.  The Tommies are a big hearted crowd & the life in the troop deck is HELL, they have no room for exercise.
