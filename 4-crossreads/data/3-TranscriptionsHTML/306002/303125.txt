<p>29.4.15<br/>Thur. 29th.  Mounted parade &amp; went to the junction of the canal, had a sleep there at dinner time &amp; were back in camp early.  After tea Arthur Welch came over &amp; we went to Heliopolis, &amp; saw a Red Cross train come in loaded with wounded Australians "mostly the 10th Btn.", they were as pleased as punch &amp; were mostly wounded on the legs &amp; arms.  They were fighting Sunday morning last &amp; done some good work.  The 9th Btn. of infantry were cut up only 23 men &amp; 3 officers answering the roll call.  Returned to camp at 10 oclock very interesting time.</p>
