Red X wife - watch at Porter & Smith.
Found I had to pay 55/-/- passage money self & wife!!!  I anticipated the Red X would pay her fare.
Then visited Laura at the Hospital, she is getting on well. I saw a good deal of young Charlie yesterday, we had lunch together & he is a bonny boy & I think will look after his Mother. Brace is in London but I don't see much of him.
