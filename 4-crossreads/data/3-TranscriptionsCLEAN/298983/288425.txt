Friday 24th to Thursday 30th MayHad a very exelent time at The Hill & feel much better for it Aunt Mary is a quick bright kind little person. She could not do enough for me and is like Aunt Mina in one way.You never eat quite enough to satisfy her. It is a very pretty country Hilly & a great many hedges. Most of the houses are old fashioned little places. Jim does a good deal of farming keeps about 50 sheep & some cattle milks 7 or 8 cows. The weather was glorious all the time except the first day being showery
