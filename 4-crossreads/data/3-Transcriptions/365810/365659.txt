<p>My leave this time came as an unexpected pleasure &amp; was most acceptable.</p>
<p>My reasons for going to the South of France were twofold.  There was a chance of seeing new places, that does not often present itself, and rumour had it that the weather down there was quite warm and good.  Report did not lie.</p>
<p>It is a most charming place.  The scenery down there is delightful.  Between <strike>Monte</strike> Toulon &amp; Monte Carlo the train runs along the coast line, so close that one would almost think the lines would be under water during heavy weather.  The houses are built on quite a different style.  With their roof gardens, pergolas, domes &amp; turrets there is something quite Moorish about them</p>
