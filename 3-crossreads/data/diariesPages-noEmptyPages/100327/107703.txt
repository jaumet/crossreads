Noticed a number of French troops about in varied and ill fitting uniforms. Did some shopping at a little store spotlessly clean called "The Three Friends" run by three partners. Very dear but the traders were honest seemingly. Toblers cocoa  lb,1/2; Black White Whisky 6/- bottle. went up street and found very interesting wild looking Greeks in native costume pretty little youngsters. Met 2 English nurses in street and they were as glad to see us as we were to see them. Talked for a while and learned that they lived up in the Citadel and were working in a new French hospital just established. Hard faced girls but it was treat to meet them. 
In a shop further down encountered a naval officer who had been on the "Powerful" and yarned for a few minutes. Saw large two storied building with French sentries on duty and orderlies running in and out. Turkish cemetery behind stone wall all overgrown a donkey feeding among graves. Nurses said the Turkish quarter was of interest but would be nothing new to us after Egypt. 
Returned to boat again at 1400 ? fare of boatmen 2d return Set off for Helles and called in at monitor again to drop two men. Some French soldiers and a marine aboard this trip. The mountains of Asiaa lovely sight with their snow cloak in the sunlight. Skipper a canny Scot introduced me to innermost recesses of his cuddy and introduced a bottle of Johnnie Walker. Reached Helles just in time to see 4 o'clock trawler setting out. Signalled her and she came alongside, we hopped over. We have had wonderful luck as regards just catching trawlers today being
