<p>duced the guns &amp; asked me if I would care for a shot, as you may guess this was right into my hands for I am simply dying for a shot.  I noticed them smile to another when they handed me my gun a nice Hollis, I suppose they thought now we'll see a bit of fun, so out we went on to the moors among the bracken &amp; scrub &amp; I simply blinded them.  I had 13 shots, got 6 rabbits 2 partridges 2 ducks &amp; 1 wild pigeon.  I had to give 1 of the ducks &amp; the pigeon the second barrel but I got everything I shot at.  The boss was astonished &amp; he said to me, well Sgt. if you chaps can <strike>shoot</strike> fight as well as you can shoot no wonder you Aussies have got a grand name for scrapping, little did he know that I had been used to a gun all my life &amp; I never let on but I fancy the old chap guessed as much.  After coming in from the moors we had a fine old tea mutton fried potatoes, pickles apples &amp; custard, good Devonshire butter</p>
