<p>A few minutes after we arrive up goes the white flag &amp; <sub>^</sub><sup>they</sup> come out of the hollow &amp; file past us to the rear.&nbsp; I am nearly mad with thirst and bless the man who offers me his water bottle.&nbsp; My two mates endeavour to raise some of out party by Helio &amp; I sit on a rock &amp; hold the horses a little distance away.&nbsp; The village is just on our right.&nbsp; An officer rides past me &amp; yells &quot;A Squadron follow me.&quot;&nbsp; They folllow him round a bend of the hill &amp; I lose sight of them.&nbsp; I speak to one of them 2 hours later &amp; he tells me that 6 of them were wounded when they charged through the town but alas they left the officer there shot through the head. <strong>X</strong> The French have <sub>^</sub><sup>now</sup> captured the six guns that shelled us (earlier in the day) on a hill at the back of the town.<strong>X</strong>&nbsp; I dont <s>where these guns were and was sitting</s></p>
