[Tuesday 12 December 1916]
The Desert is at this its best now & the nights perfect, it seems wrong to be killing men all these years, how long is it all going to last.Aeroplanes bombed 3rd Reg last yesterday & they sail over us each day.We can see the domes & minarets of Al Arish from our lines.I can't give much information as to what we are doing but it is much the same as of old.Clothing always sticky from the Brackish water & our skin gets cracked & sore.I told you I've got the Criminals hair cut again.All the ANZAC Mounted Division are now to wear Emu feathers in their Hats certainly adds to picturesque of Millinery & breaks
