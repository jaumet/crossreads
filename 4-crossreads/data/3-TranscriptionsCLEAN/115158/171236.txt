We pursued our northerly course keeping inside the Barrier Reef. during the day we passed several steamers, all of which we compelled to show their colours and declare themselves. One ship S.S."Cairnhill", was being towed by a tug on account of a broken tail shaft. She had, for some time, been a helpless derelict amongst the Islands. She seemed a little perturbed when ordered to hoist her colours, and asked "What is the matter?" She was coldly informed that we were at war with Germany. During the day we heard that three French ships were concentrated on Penang Straits, and also that the English China Squadron was steaming South to intercept German colliers destined for the enemy cruisers "Gneisnau" and "Scharnhorst". The weather grew perceptibly warmed as we worked our way up the Reef and the "rig of the day" was changed from "blues" to "all whites".
