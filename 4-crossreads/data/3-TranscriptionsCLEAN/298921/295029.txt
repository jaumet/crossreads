  
 February, 1915. Thursday 25 Just had a letter from [indecipherable] who writes from the Abysinian frontier E Sudan, with little hope of coming my way - Divisional day today, the desert is hot, covered with flinty stones, [indecipherable] & sand except for the want of trees not unlike the Murilla Ridges near the Opal fields of Lightning Ridge. Recd letter from Laura dated Dec 17th & saying Charlie had heard from War office that I am entitled to any second Medal or Rings, i.e. 2 Ribbons.
