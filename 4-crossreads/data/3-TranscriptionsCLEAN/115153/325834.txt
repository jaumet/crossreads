 Mr H. Wright  Mitchell Librarian 
 Dear Sir, Under separate cover I am sending my war diary by registered packet post, which I hope you shall receive in good order. You will note that I have had my manuscript typewritten and that it now comprised 41 pages.  Hoping to receive a favourable reply from you in due course. 
 I remain Yours in anticipation 
 James Irwin
