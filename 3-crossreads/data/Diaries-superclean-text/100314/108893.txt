outside. Took this chance of getting well up to date in matters of routine correspondence. Recommendations preparing for the Birthday Honours List. Have not had much change for yarning with family here owing to being so busy today. In the evening received orders to go to Flixecourt on the 3rd March and cursed it rather as all my preparations are in train for going up the line. It will mean that tomorrow I see the last of as nice a billet as one could wish for. A cold dark and wet night that must be rotten for the poor chaps in the line. At mess tonight with Fulton others recalling old experiences and the many hard cases we have had in the regiment
