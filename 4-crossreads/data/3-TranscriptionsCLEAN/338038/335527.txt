"I am fearfully down about Terry Garlings & Martins  so many old friends & dear fellows have gone "Home West" we call it here, its heart-rending to me who knew  & valued them so highly.  About 5 officers went in some 10 days.  My fine old comrade since 1914 Gordon Tinsley gone too.  Oh! the sadness of it all.  Dear I havnt the addresses here of their people, but if you meet them do please let them know how I feel  (I simply cant' write, am no good when I most want to express my sympathy as you well know)  Tell  them of my deep regard for these dear chaps & what it meant to me as C.O. to have them to work with, they were so fine & true.  The Soldiering part counts much of course, but it is the personal loss of valued friends that hurts me - I have met no fined soldier or truer comrade than Garling & Martin was always a gentleman & true as gold.  Tinsley has been with me always & Capt [indecipherable] tells me he was a tower of strength to him all those bitter bitter days of Passchendaele
