FELDPOST  FritzFrance30.8.18
Dear FatherWell it seems some time since I wrote you but things have been a bit unsettled lately for letter writing. We were on the move for awhile & the mail was closed so couldent post them as soon as we reached our destination went practically straight into the line so hadent a chance of writing. Well you will have seen all about the big push & the share the Australians have had in it. It has been a great stunt quite a change from the usual trench fighting as it is semi open fighting now & suits our fellows to the ground. Fritzey isent facing it too well.  At times he puts up a bit of a go in some strong point but they soon shift him from it. Well we have nearly all the ground we lost back again now & shall give him a nasty shaking while he is holding his old position. The guns etc that have been captured are pretty great but havent the slightest idea what has been taken. I have gone through without a scratch so far so havent anything to complain about. I shall squeeze through as usual never fear. Well we are getting close to the end of the summer now but the weather still keeps very good. We have had splendid sunrise very little wet weather. Then since the offensive started
