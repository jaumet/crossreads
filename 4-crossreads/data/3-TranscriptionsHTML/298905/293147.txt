<p>31st. Yesterday evening I took our bladder down to Headquarters &amp; fixed her up, she had a small puncture in her &amp; the cover also was starting to rip. About 10 oclock last night we were ordered to "stand to" &amp; be ready to move off in 5 minutes, I think our fellow's started it, for last night the batteries changed over &amp; that generally means a fair bit of strafing, from our billet we could see the German shrapnel bursting all over the place, it was a very heavy bombardment &amp; lasted for nearly 3 hour's, I think the 3rd Bde got the brunt of it. I have not heard how many casualties there were. Had charge of our section yesterday for bayonet fighting &amp; squad drill.<br/>This morning myself &amp; 4 others from the Company were sent to a gas</p>
