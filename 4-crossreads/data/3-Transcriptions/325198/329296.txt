<p>1 May, 1916<br/>Romania [Romani]<br/>Once more the horse lines are fixed up &amp; we have made a mi-mi to accommodate our section of four, it serves as a shelter from the sun during the day but at night it is of no use to us as we are usually on out post &amp; when not on duty the troop have to sleep all together in the open  Every one stands-to at 4 o,clock &amp; there are "no lights" while it is dark consequently there is no smoking but of course when a mob of men have to get up at 4.0 &amp; stand about until daylight the temptation to have a draw is pretty great.  Pearce was Orderly officer the other morning he has a low irritating voice, he said "when I give an order I expect it to be carried out" &amp; noticing a pretty healthy smell of tobacco he told old Bill to see the boys put their fags out.  Bill had been indulging discreetly himself &amp; when Pearce accosted him, he had to jam the lighted cigarette into his pocket &amp; hold it there, &amp; it would'nt go out so Bill was pretty red in the face against he got down to the end of the line with the strain of keeping back a flow of strong Australian language.</p>
