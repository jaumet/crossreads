 They look peculiar after the Lorri of Sydney . The nativ policemen are also amus . If a man doe anyth he doe not run him in , but lam him with a big stick or anyth that happen to be on hand . He show no merci either . This afternoon they boy on board were throw money to the nativ on the wharf . Gee whiz , you ought to have seen the scrambl . They dive down on it like hawk . It remind me of a footbal scrum onli they were lie down in the mud kick , grunt and squeal . We near burst our side when the policeman came up with a pale and start whack them . Say ! It was like a pantomim to see the scatter the nativ are veri frighten of the policeman and the soldier A veri good thing too . Small four wheel cab are to be seen tear here and there They seem to have no speed limit There is a railway side alongsid the wharf and everyth is in a bustl , all the nativ talk
