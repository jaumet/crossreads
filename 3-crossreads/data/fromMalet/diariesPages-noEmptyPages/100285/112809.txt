looks as if we have come a gutser After tea Lindsay I went round to see Jack Gribble as we promised, they were having dinner were nearly all more or less drunk, all the officers present were under arrest for something or other, Jack was celebrating his getting out of his Court Martial so lightly he was as happy as could be. Jack persuaded me to have a glass of whisky to drink his health with, so I did it was the first whisky I had ever tasted in my life it will be the last I hope, we stopped about an hour with them, then went down for a walk to Green Hills Y M. C. A. which is a very fine one, it was originally a private residence but the Y.M.C.A rent it off them for 9 a week I believe, there is also a fine little gymnasium attached to the place
