Friday 18 August 1916We all rode over to the Meditteranean [Mediterranean] for a swim and had a great day.Bought some soda water & condensed milk & mixed em and did not feel well after it.  Had good time.
Saturday 19 August 1916Stables only as per usual.  Went to lecture in evening in Y.M.C.A. by Chaplain on the Brittish advance in France.  Very interresting indeed.
