<p>In Hospital<br/><u>Sunday 1st July 1917</u></p>
<p>My Dear Judge,<br/>Your two letters of 18th April (from Melbourne) and 21st May have come to hand. The latter via America, in three weeks ahead of any other letters I have received from Sydney. No one else seems to be able to catch an American mail and, as you said, the ordinary mail is very irregular and uncertain.<br/>I was very glad that you had had news of Keith as satisfactory as could be expected &ndash; though in such matters news seems to be invariably vague. I have written to him and expect to hear that he is convalescing at some English country home where he would be bound to have a good rest coupled with any amusement or entertainment he might want.</p>
