<p>through from the front Fritz is being worried a great deal &amp; the British have gained many successes. I have at last secured a good job, issuing clean clothes to the patients at the baths.

<p>About March the 12th the Unit received the sad news of the death of Colonel Williams. He was killed whilst inspecting the Aid Posts. He has been with our Unit right from the very start (at Queens Park) &amp; only left us last December. He was a Major in our Ambulance, promoted to Colonel a few months ago &amp; put in charge of another Ambulance.  He was most popular amongst the men here, a thorough sport, &amp; a white man all through. In cricket, football, or any other sports he was always to the fore &amp; joined in all our games, I was really very sorry when I heard the sad news.<br/>The Dargin Boys from Mosman are camped close at hand.   They are old Neutral Bay</p>
