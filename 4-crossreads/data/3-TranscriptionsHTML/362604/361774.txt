<p>which the W.A.A.C's had got up for "der tag", our Day.  We have not had our Clothes off since last Tuesday so we are all going to strain a point &amp; get into some clean togs to-morrow.  We marched out of Boulogne on Tuesday the 12th &amp; took train at 2.45 p.m. after a 3&frac12; mile march with those awful heavy packs.  Ellis &amp; I got corner seats in a 3rd class carriage which was ever so much more comfortable than the cattle trucks that the rest of the Boys had.  We had some sleep but you can guess what sort of a bump we got every time the train started &amp; stopped for we had about 500 yds of carriages or rather cattle trucks &amp; it nearly broke</p>
