<p>good consideration,</p>
<p>This letter will have to serve for all hands for a while dad, you can let Percy and Clarry know how I am and that I will answer their letters as soon as possible. There is really nothing I can tell you of much interest there is so much I could say but it would never reach you. I have been very pleased to note by all your letters how Aub is improving in health and I sincerely hope that by the time I get back he will be quite recovered.<br/>Well dad, I must sign off for this time,<br/>Trusting that you are all well.<br/>With fondest love to Mother Yourself and all the rest.<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Gordon</p>
