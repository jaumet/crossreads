when our platoon & No2 went over & took a German outpost without a casualty. He only had a machine-gun crew & a flare-man in it & when they saw us coming they beat it. The following morning, the 17th, we moved back about 50 yds to enable the 19th Bn to do a stunt. They took an outpost on our left but had to fight for it. In the night we were relieved by the 18th Bn & came back to supports. We relieved each other twice during the next fortnight & then we were relieved by the 6th Bgde & came back to Blangy-Tronville to prepare for the big stunt. On the 6th of August we moved up to a trench in front of Blangy & the following night we moved up to the "hopping off" tape at 10 p.m. We got into position on the tape & had to wait there till 4.20 a.m. "Zero" time. At about 3.30 a very thick fog came down & at 4.20 it was just as thick as ever. At 4.20 a.m. the guns opened up from the right & went right around to the left. The best barrage I have ever heard & it played hell with his trenches. When the guns opened it was a signal for everybody to fix his bayonet &a also for the tanks, who were just behind
