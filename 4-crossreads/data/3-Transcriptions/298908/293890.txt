<p>there was something fishy in these questions.  However it ended there for that night, but each night through the week she kept asking me little questions about my trip &amp; Sunday in particular till I began to get a bit tangled &amp; confused in my own mind for I had to remember a mass of lies that had been built one upon the other like a pyramid.  I thought to myself what a wonderful knowledge old Shakespeare had of human beings when he said</p>
<p>"Oh what a tangled web we weave<br/>When first we practice to deceive.</p>
<p>This sort of thing went on till last night when Ethel asked me quite innocently what kind of a time I had at the Royal last Sunday evening.  Well I nearly fell off the seat you could have knocked me down with a feather, after me telling all these lies to be bowled out like that, &amp; the worst of it was that I can honestly say that this was the first deliberate lie that I had ever told that I can remember &amp; I suppose she would think now that I was in the habit of doing &amp; saying these things.</p>
