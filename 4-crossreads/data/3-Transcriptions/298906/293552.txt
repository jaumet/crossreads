<p>of all in many ways, it has been pay day &amp; this always means a big batch of drunks.<br/>19th. Sunday &amp; a nice day though a little cloudy, this morning when I took my church parade state down, old Tubby called me over &amp; said Sergt. haven't you got a better hat than that, I said no, I have spoken to the Q. Master about it several times but he seems to take no notice, well you tell the Q M that he is to get you a new hat at once, I have been waiting for old Tubby to say something about my hat ever since I have been here, for she is pretty old &amp; faded &amp; I was quite determined that whatever else I might buy I would not get a hat, for its up to the military</p>
