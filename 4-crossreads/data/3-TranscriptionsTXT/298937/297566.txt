Kiplings good old Recessional was one of the hymns & recalled to my mind the old hall at St. Olaves.  The Senior Chaplain of the forces gave a short & pointed address, emphasizing the supreme sacrifice & bravery of those men who made the historic landing.At the close of the service all the wreathes that had been profusely decorating the auditorium were taken by ambulances to the cemetery at Old Cairo where all soldiers who have died in Egypt lie buried.I must not forget the impressive sounding of the last post at the conclusion of the service.
