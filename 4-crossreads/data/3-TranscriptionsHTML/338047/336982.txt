<p>1919<br/>April 7<br/>show, we caught the Nord-Sud underground back to St Lazare to connect up with the Metropolitain.  Some of the froggies started to trot, so we started to trot too.  We arrived just in time to see the last train going out, so came up into the boulevard.  We met a Tommy who was going back to the Army &amp; Navy Leave Club, who knew the way.  We walked for a while &amp; at last ended up at the Madeleine.  He then admitted that he was lost, so I told him that I knew my way from there, &amp; took charge of the party.   Women of easy virtue thronged the boulevards at this time of night, all painted up &amp; dolled out with fussy clothes.  Troops were their especial prey.  They made themselves particularly willing &amp; we had literally to shake them off.  It did not seem to me that the licensed houses of ill fame kept many women off the streets as it is popularly supposed to do.  We arrived home very late of course.</p>
<p>Apl 8<br/>We went by car to Versailles Palace (20 francs for the whole day, for everything).  The driver &ndash; a Tommy was about twice as reckless as any</p>
