<p>so that night 7th January I went down on the train to Cairo &amp; here we were met by a motor ambulance which took us to No.2. Ghezerieh one of the finest of Egyptian hospitals, before the  war it was a palace belonging to one of the Egyptian princes, &amp; he handed it over to the authorities on the outbreak of war, it is a most beautiful building inside for the rooms are a tremendous size &amp; well finished, they have enomorous chandeliers hanging from the ceilings &amp; electric lit throughout, Ghezerieh is right alongside the Nile &amp; the trains run right past the door almost, &amp; the drives are good</p>
