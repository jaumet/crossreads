 13 April We have been in the trenches, 3 days.  It rained all the first two days but today is fine giving us a chance to dry our clothes.  Our duty is in the supports.  We also do guard at night and carrying the Coys rations.  This is a quiet firing line with very little rifle shooting.  The enemy is 500 yds. away.  We have been shelled a bit today, 1 killed, & 2 wounded. 
 14 April Wet day. 
 15 April We are relieved by the 19th and march out at dark to billets in Armentiers. 
 16 April Resting in the billets.  1 Fine day. 
 17 April On fatigue in the supports in the wet. 
 18 April Wet day.  Get a warm bath and change of underclothes. 
 19 April Move into the trenches, more rain.  Had trouble getting a dug out - finally got one with another individual - very comfortable - a good deal of shelling during the afternoon.  Spent nearly all night on fatigue - intend going in for heavy weight lifting when the war is over.  Got to bed, wet through at 3 AM tired out.
