 September, 1915 Friday 17 Letter from May &amp; Day Aug 8th thank them all the News, also [indecipherable] Joe Massagecommences this morning soon alright now. About 1 mile away is situated one of the best observatories in the world &amp; the Meteorologist was kind enough to shew us the MOON, this big telescope &ndash; to my mind it looked like a specimen of Tubercular Lung from a Bullock. Three times a week a Picture Show is given for convalescent men here in the Hospital grounds &ndash; Better than the Pictures are the remarks made by the Audience apropos the picture, such as "Light Diet that man" "Put him down for Australia."
