18.2.1917My dear Father,
I sent you a cable this morning with Birthday wishes. Should have sent it 2 days ago to reach you on time but it was not for want of thinking of it. No opportunity to get it through till today.
This is not a letter but mail closes today so am just letting you know we are still OK - Incoming
