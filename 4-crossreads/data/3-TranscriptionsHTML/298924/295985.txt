<p>Friday, 3 January 1919<br/>President of 3 Field General Court Martials today.  Went into figures of 1st L.H. Regt. &amp; find the following &ndash;</p>
<p>Casualties, not sickness<br/>Officers &ndash; Other ranks<br/>46 &ndash; 636</p>
<p>not counting twice, wounded.  These figures are larger than any other Australian Unit yet many people think the L.H. have done little or no fighting.</p>
<p>See next page.</p>
<p>General Allenby's words were printed in big white letters &ndash;</p>
<p>"I was proud of you once.  I am proud of you no longer." This was the end of this speech after the Bedouin affair.</p>
