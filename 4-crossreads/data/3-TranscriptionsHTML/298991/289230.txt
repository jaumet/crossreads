<p>Thursday Oct 25th<br/>Land (South Africa) was sighted about midday. Sea is very choppy, with a South Easterly blowing. Very cold. Arrived at Capetown about 4 pm &amp; pulled into the Harbour about 6 pm. It is a very small crampy harbour, but has a good few wharves. The whole convoy went into harbour soon after arrival. Capetown is right at the foot of Table Mountain &amp; Lion's Head Mountain. A very stiff wind was blowing all the evening. The Officers &amp; nurses went ashore soon after arrival, we are to get leave tomorrow. Coaling operations and watering was commenced as soon as we had made fast to the wharf. Niggers do the coaling. Everything on the boat is smothered in coal dust.</p>
