<p>26.11.15<br/>Fri 26th<br/>Sold 28 cabbages this morning we decided to keep all the mandarines &amp; potatoes, has been very cloudy with a few drops of rain during the day &amp; it being my turn to do the trip to Bde HQ with the daily state, I had a rough passage; the night was pitch dark except when a flash of lightning lit up the country &amp; just as I was about the start the storm broke &amp; the sap to Bde being all up &amp; down hill, I had several falls &amp; a very interesting trip right through by walking into the end of the sap where I should have turned etc. Boots, socks, trousers &amp; overcoat were all that got wet &amp; I turned into bed soon after I got back; I believe the Turks got quite cheeky today opposite the 6th  &amp; 7th L.H. gathering wood from in front of their trenches, the lads stood it for a long time &amp; then a few opened fire against orders. The order not to fire was renewed &amp; now lasts till midnight tomorrow.</p>
