<p>Men only staying 24 hours at trenches now, The stink of the dead too bad, in fact they have to dig new trenches, and fill in old ones, at the same time burying the dead in it. I have taken the 3lb with 300 rounds of ammunition up to the trenches  Very quiet, at present, likely to liven up any minute, very hot, flies bad. 9.15 A.M. A fierce attack all along the line. Asiatic Annie done some damage last night at 12 o'clock, set fire to millions of rounds of ammunition. One man in 3rd Bty killed by shrapnel<br/>18/7/1915<br/>Reinforcements for R.N.D. arrived last night. The Chesshire regiment of foot arrived yesterday. Portion of Kitcheners army. Very tame all day. The fire on the night of 17th the ammunition was mostly captured Turkish with some French and British, It was in a heap ready to be sorted<br/>19/7/1915<br/>Monday. Fine morning. 6.30. It will be a hot day. Flies still a nuisance, eat you alive. Our well almost knocked out. A 4.7 shell fell about 2 feet off it. I was in amongst the dust, and smoke, As luck would have it only 2 men were there, just arrived the day before</p>
