<p>10-4-1917<br/>Blizzards, all day, cold as charity.  In an open field, no shelter at all, wind howling all day.  A few shells in Bapaume.  Bodies of some women found in a well.  These Huns are dasterly people.  12 casualties in 2nd Brigade.  Two more of our planes smashed up, (false landing) men carried away on stretchers.  We move in a day or two.  Huns still retreating.</p>
