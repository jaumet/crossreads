<p>29 June 1916 Thur<br/>Digging all day making two large grease traps. Received a long letter from Roy. Glad to hear that all is well &amp; moreso to learn of his enlistment.

<p>30 June 1916 Fri<br/>Bricklaying most of the day with Sgt Thomas. Had an early tea &amp; went on a visit to the 17th Batt. Stopped at D Company where I met Wilbert Carrol who informed me of Norm Lewis death. I then saw Ronny &amp; Mac adjourning with them to their billet where we had a good old talk &amp; several of the best. 22 aeroplanes.</p>
