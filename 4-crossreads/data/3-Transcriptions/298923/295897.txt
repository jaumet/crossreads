<p>19 August 1918 Monday<br/>Through Jerusalem &amp; Bethany by moonlight once more-   I think the Holy places look their best when all is quiet at night.<br/>Camp 3 miles out fed &amp; slept till 3 AM then rode on downhill all the way in a haze of dust to Talat Dumm which I told you of before &amp; means Hill of Blood owing to color of the soil-  Jim Ayre is here, &amp; going strong tho' hands bad with Septics.  We often yarn about Riverina as we eat your Sweets together</p>
