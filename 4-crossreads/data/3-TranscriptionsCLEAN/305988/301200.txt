  
 On the 16th we were relieved and came back for a rest. On the 20th we were back in Biefvillers again. Stayed there for a few days & then went back again; we had lost touch of Fritz then & didn't know where he was. Sunday April 15th Fritz broke though the 1st Div line on our right & came up the sunken road in our rear. Up till then he had been going strong, but he got a bit mixed up there & then they got demoralised & didn't know which way to turn, so they made a bolt for it & we literally butchered them with rifle & machine gun fire. There were hundreds of them lying about the next morning. We went down the next night & took over the outpost from the 1st Div. On the 18th we were relieved & came back to Vaulx about 5 miles behind the line. 20th We took over a position in a sunken road near Lagnicourt on the right of Norreuil guarding the 60 pounders in case he happened to break through again 24th Came back to Vaulx. Wednesday 2nd May Bullicourt stunt, but I told you about that in a letter that I sent over to you while you were in England. 
 We came back after that, cut up & stayed out for four months.  "Some spell."
