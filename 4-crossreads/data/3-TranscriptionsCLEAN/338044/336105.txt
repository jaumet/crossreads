Talk about hard work. This is the limit, after breakfast we have to shave & clean boots &  leggings for 9-30 am parade. Inspection follows and is very rigid  Full dress & even buttons must be done up. After parade we had a lecture in shed until 11 am &  were then paid. I have leave from 3 pm to 10 pm to go into Cairo. Caught 3.30 pm train from Hellmick Station &  as usual was rushed by boot boys on arrival at Cairo. As I intended going out to the General Hospital to see friends I had my boots & leggings cleaned  The boy took great pains in shining for about 15 minutes & such a shine
