<p>tired &amp; hungry the place being very poor looking, wet &amp; dreary. The billets also were poor &amp; the men very wrath. I was dead tired by the time I had seen everyone billeted.<br/>Tuesday 8th Oct.<br/> A very trying day. The billets were spread over the village &amp; it was about a mile to do the Round. This I had to do several times, arranging extra billets, all left to me as the officers went away for most of the day. Had breakfast at 8.30 &amp; parade at 9.30, the men marching to a central position. Arranged each section to do its own cooking, thus causing competition, the men gaining by improvement in cooking. I was billeted in a room at our mess, a fine bed &amp; spent a glorious night between sheets. Things much more cheerful by daylight, but on the whole it's a poor place for a rest, the roads being poor &amp; extras hard to get, no shops &amp; only one estaminet. Fixed up a reading &amp; recreation room, arrangements having been made to obtain books &amp; such things. Arranged for Canteen with a Sgt. in charge which will be an improvement on our late canteen</p>
