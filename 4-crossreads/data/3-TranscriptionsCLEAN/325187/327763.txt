 The Water here is obtained from 4 sources- 1. One is a Cistern built by the Romans & dependent on the rainfall, cannot be relied on & is very hard to find 2. Underground springs deep & requiring proper pumping appliances. 3. Sand Wells like Riverina   (4) unreliable small supply. Went Cairo per horse & Train a long wearisome journey on duty for missing Equipment & paid 10 PT = 2/s for a Bath on arrival- Sore lips & sore eyes from the drifting sand
