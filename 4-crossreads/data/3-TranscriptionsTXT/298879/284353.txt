 March &ndash; April 1915 Wednesday 31 Last night was very hot. Hope to go down to the lines &amp; draw a few of the quidlets that are due to me by now. There are a large number of sick men in the camp &amp; hospital from the various Regiments. The men are sick of this hanging around &amp; have no enthusiasm what-ever. They want "fight", what they volunteered for &amp; I am with them. 
 Thursday April 1 Left hospital today. Feel very week. Batt out on Divisional manoeuvres. They left at about 8 AM. &amp; are to return about 4 PM
