26/11/18 St Souplet
The brigade passed its starting point at 9.30 pm and on the whole was turned out well. With BM McColl stood by the side of the road and watched all go past. Fog came down and we could not see far ahead. The Battalions all carrying their colours and flags. General Robertson was at a x roads and I met him there and again watched the column go past. We got into the village of St Souplet – a place which had been well knocked about by the guns. Had a few sandwiches and then to horse again and rode through St Benin to Le Cateau. En route passed a large high railway bridge demolished. It had rested on high masonry piers but an explosion had ruined the whole of it. Coming into Le Cateau saw duds being blown up by electricity.
