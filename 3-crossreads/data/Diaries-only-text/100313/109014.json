More snow. Felt unwell so stayed abed until about 10.30. Pottered round on odd jobs and sent Major Matthews up to the line to see our working party on the job. Pottered about all day. Our dinner in the evening ? General Paton and Col. James were there and about 16 other guests. 38 of our own chaps. I proposed the toast of 6th Bde the General responded. A good evening.

Unwell and stayed in bed with a heavy cold. Nothing much doing except that Brigade H.Q. rang up and said I was to have a month's leave starting in about a week's time. The weather still continues cold and snowy and the evenings are long and dark. Some of our young officers are very slack and don't keep themselves aloof from the men as they should.
