  
 On Active Service 3/Sep/15. Dear Alan. I have no doubt that you will get to England. The Dardenelles must fall soon & then our chaps will be in camp. Met some wounded N.S.W. boys in London. They make great chums with the wounded Canadian & we had many a pot together. Met Bert Ratcliffe & he took me to the Piccadilly hotel. Some place - he paid. England is worth breaking your neck to see. The girls have some complexions believe me
