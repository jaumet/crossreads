<p>Friday 9-3-17<br/>The Engineers are being trained in the use of a Hydraulic drilling machine which promises to be very usefull for digging communication saps, Blowing up Barbed wire &amp; mining.  French &amp; Russian prisoners of war are practically set free if they consent to work in munition factories. Others are loaned to Farmers in Batches of 25 in charge of a Sentry.  The farmer is held responsible for them.  It is significant that the prisoners say nothing about British prisoners.  German Soldiers home letters are not censored,  some of the prisoners (Hanoverians) wear Gibralter on their cuffs they say they fought with the British against Spain in 1733</p>
