 Pension Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 4.5.16 Cairo. March 21st. 1916. My very dear Father &amp; Mother, We have heard no general order concerning the outward mails &amp; so am going to continue writing &amp; posting: it seems to be a military order as far as we can see.  I hope you received my post-card last mail telling you that Wal Le &amp; I were together, I was anxious for you to know as soon as possible &amp; wrote it in a cafe while we were out. It was about 3 o'clock on the Tuesday that Le marched in much to my surprise &amp; delight, though really I hardly knew him at first, he was so dirty &amp; had a moustache, and of course I had not been expecting him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was up partly on duty to see about the removal of some of their black kit bags to another base (which looks like a move &amp; his bag is among them.)  We had a yarn for about half an hour &amp; then he had to go to the Headquarters till about 6.30 &amp; that just fitted in with my afternoon business &amp; we arranged to meet after it.  In the meantime I sent Wal a telegram telling him that we would come out in the evening, for I was afraid of missing him otherwise &amp; it seemed the only chance that we might have of being together as Le expected to leave next morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after we had had dinner together we set out to Wal's camp &amp; found him without any trouble.  Wal arranged for him to go back &amp; sleep there with him &amp; then they came back into Cairo with me &amp; we had supper &amp; ices &amp; yarned hard all the time.  It was then that I wrote the post-card to you.
