tried to make them beleive I was born in Belfast & had crossed the "line" on the way out, but was to no purpose, I was ordered a bath & they just did lather me with that soot & ducked me well too.  I got more than anyone else I think.  Suppose it was to be my just reward for having spent the whole day in arranging the affair.
We had electric lights all over the No. 3 hatch & round my room, where the ceremony was held.  I thoroughly enjoyed being dipped & would have been disappointed had I not been.  The following is the Programme.
