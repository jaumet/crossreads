Thursday 12 [11] July 1917 [1918]1/2 day, stayed in until 4.30 p.m., then Cairo - bought white shoes, Pt. 53 - 2nd dinner.  Life has been so full these times & the joy of nursing our own people is great.Jarroed, Dalby, looks tired of it all but the younger men can go on yet.  Groppi's known as the "Powder & paint show" (to these officer boys) is a fine sight these 5 p.m. afternoons.  Officers of every description & Sisters, V.A.D's & civilians throng in & out.  One takes one's plate & fork, selects the cakes, pays Pt. 3 (or Pt. 1 each) & walks through rows of tiny tables & gazes to the fancied spot, garcon brings Icecream sodas, etc. & one becomes one of the lookers on.
