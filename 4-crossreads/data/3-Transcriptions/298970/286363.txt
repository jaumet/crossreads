<p>send them right on to the Ambulance Dressing Station.<br/>At 6 p.m. returned to Wye Farm.  Another trip for rations which proved very lively with machine guns sweeping the road and shells flying on all sides.  Glad to get into bed.</p>

<p>Out of bed at about 10 a.m.  It was mostly artillery firing today.  Fritz knocked our trenches about a bit.  Machine Guns &amp; snipers dangerous at night.</p>

<p>Beautiful Day.  Had to get up early this morning to prepare for an inspection by Mjr. Gen. McKay but he didn't come.  Instructions referred to the General as Lance-Corporal so as to ward off any spies.  Our Artillery and a few 75's</p>
