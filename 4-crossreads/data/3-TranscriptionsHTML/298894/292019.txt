<p><u>Punch</u></p>
<p><u>To a False Patriot</u></p>
<p>He came obedient to the call;<br/>He might have shirked like half his mates<br/>Who, while their comrades fight &amp; fall,<br/>Still go to swell the football gates.</p>
<p>And you a patriot in your prime,<br/>You waved the flag above his head,<br/>And hoped he'd have a high old time,<br/>And slapped him on the back and said;</p>
<p>You'll show 'em what we British are!<br/>Give us your hand, old pal and shake;<br/>And took him round from bar to bar<br/>And made him drunk &ndash; for England's sake.</p>
<p>That's how you helped him. Yesterday,<br/>Clear eyed and earnest, keen and hard,<br/>He held himself the soldier's way-<br/>And now they've got him under guard.</p>
<p>That doesn't hurt you; you're alright;<br/>Your easy conscience takes no blame;<br/>But he , poor boy with morning light,<br/>He eats his heart out, sick with shame.</p>
<p>What's that to you? You understand<br/>Nothing of all his bitter pain;<br/>You have no regiment to brand;<br/>You have no uniform to stain;</p>
