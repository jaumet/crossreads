Colonel Matson has been around again to see me. Basil and Jack Dennis are at present in the Line. They were both very well when I saw them last. Don't you make too violent love to all my girls when they call especially Kathleen Everett Mrs Wisdom and Hettie Bamford. All good luck to you old chap. I hope you'll soon be alright. We are all well here and the whole staff send you their love. Yours Sincerely William Holmes
