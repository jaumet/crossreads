<p><u>Gallipoli</u><br/>4:9:15 &ndash; "The attack was entrusted to Major-General Cox, on the right by 350 rifles of the 4th and 5th Australian Brigades, centre by 400 rifles of the New Zealand Mounted Rifles and 5th Australian Brigade and on the left by 250 rifles Connaught Rangers.  The bombardment commenced at 4 p.m., 28th, and at 1 o'clock in the morning of the 29th the Australian Light Horse carried the trench on the top.  The fighting throughout was almost entirely hand to hand and of a very severe nature.  The shrapnel fire and machine guns of the Turks were terrific.  Casualties &ndash; about 1000 &ndash; Turkish losses 5,000, with 300 rifles, 60,000 rounds of ammunition and 500 bombs.  By this success 400 more acres of Turkish territory was added to the country occupied by Anzac."</p>
<p>13:9:15 &ndash; According to French Official Reports the number of German Officers killed, wounded and missing from the beginning of the war to 1st June 1915 was 43,992.  These losses had increased to 52,041 by 5th July, showing an increase of 9069 in 45 days or 360 Officers per day.</p>
<p>16:9:15 &ndash; The position has now been unchanged for days.  We need strong reinforcements to settle this question.  This desultory fighting is no good.  The Turks are improving their position day by day which will soon again be impregnable.  After all we are only along the sea shore, so to speak, whilst they hold the commanding positions.  We must have greater numbers before any forward movement can be attempted.  The old hands here all require a rest and are utterly wearied and complaining among themselves.  This is bad for morale.  The Authorities recognise this and have sent away during this week the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and others to Mudros for a month's spell.  The 7th Australian Infantry Brigade have taken their place.  This Brigade is formed of Queenslanders and Tasmanians.</p>
<p>18:9:15 &ndash; This afternoon the Turks made a brilliant demonstration all along the Army Corps front.  There was no attack, however.  There was heavy shell firing in the direction of Suvla and for an hour the roar of guns and incessant rifle fire rent the atmosphere.  I have noticed lately the Turkish superiority at concealment, and this is a standing reproof to the discipline of our own army.  The Turks are very seldom seen and carry on their extensive defensive operations with wonderful celerity and quietness.  They are up to all the ruses under the sun &ndash; dancing towards our lines;  approaching front trenches with hands raised above their heads and then suddenly collecting together and rushing trenches:  dressing in our uniforms:  bomb ruses &ndash; instantaneous fuses, etc.</p>
<p>19:9:15 &ndash; A Turkish deserter &ndash; Ismail Mahomet Ali &ndash; 5th Company, 2nd Battalion, 24th Regiment, was brought in to-day.  He appeared to be in good health but complained of sore feet.  He was wearing only thin shoes and was dressed in a khaki cloth jacket and trousers with a soft cap.  I would say he was a middle-aged man.  Examined, he said he came from a vilayet of Smyrna, but that he was "fed-up" with fighting, like a lot more of the Turks in his Company.  He said the Turks had heaps of food and water, brought up by mules and then into the trenches by fatigue parties.</p>
