 Friday 9 June 1916 Wet last night but a nice day followed it : storm clouds worked up once or twice but practically no rain fell. Bayonet work before breakfast &amp; a continuation of the course during the day. In the afternoon when the work was done I walked up to the Div. baths &amp; much enjoyed a thorough clean up. It was a glorious evening &amp; the &frac12; hr's. walk was most enjoyable. After tea I went in to Sailly to get instructions about joining up with the company at the completion of the school, &amp; stayed at the old billet for some time chatting to Capt Herrod &amp; the other officers. A very interesting bombardment of an enemy aeroplane in which our guns must have fired over 200 shells was clearly on view as I walked out. A most lovely sunset going on all the home.
