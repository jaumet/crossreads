12 noon.  Papers to hand this morning dated Melbourne during February, from Mrs Knowles.  A letter from Nurse Suttclife, formerly of the Sydney Hospital, now of "Belgium Hospital, La Panne, Belgium". Not looked at. Letter from Mrs Begbie of Plattsburg.  Not had time to look at them yet, desiring to finish off my letters for post as soon as possible, that there may be no fear of being late for the next mail.
Good bye now my dears.  God bless you.  Hope that you may find these pages and the accompanying sheets interesting.  Best wishes for all my friends.  Did Pat Watt receive my two letters.  She is a very lazy girl not to answer them.  Please tell her so from me.  Love to Maria.  Love & heaps of kisses to each of you, & may life be for all prosperous long & ever happy.
