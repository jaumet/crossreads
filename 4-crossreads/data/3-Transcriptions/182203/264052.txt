<p>struck 10. o'clock. We had such nice Officers with us  One was an expatient of mine &amp; the other two his pals. We had the youngest Colonel in the Army with us. Quite a boy, about 23 yrs. old.<br/>Sunday-morning got up early for 6.15. a.m. Communion. We had it at our "Home", quite a nice little service. On duty all day Sunday. I have sent my dress-basket with my civilian clothes in. Perhaps you girls can make some use of them. I'm sorry now I did not send them before.</p>
