Big gun fight has been in progress since early morn & in the distance can be heard the large guns of the British squadron some miles down the peninsula south of observation station Kabe Tepe.
The roar of guns is terrific & the contrast from our position of a few days ago is pronounced.
Today our Naval Corp sent across to the north end of peninsula small body of men to destroy an observation post which was doing a deal of good to the enemy gunners.  The raid was successful as I noted a large number of prisoners at the H.Q. & also a number were killed.
The big 11 inch guns of the Goebin are still active & throw great projectiles right across the peninsula at our transports - all to no purpose - our life appears to be charmed & our luck everlasting.  In the field out beyond the 7th battalion I came on an awful looking trench caused through one of these shells falling short & exploding under ground.  It easily would bury three men comfortably - Here also a number of graves show the last resting place of a company of infantry.
