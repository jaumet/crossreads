<p>24/9/17 Dominion Camp<br/>A lovely sunny day. No one got up until late and then everyone was tired out and lacked energy. Took a couple of short summons against men who were A.W.L. from the line and then met the doctor and walked &frac34; hr into Reninghelst for a bath &ndash; quite the best since Erquinghem. How good to soak and get the dirt out of the pores. Made a few little purchases and then returned. A very dusty place full of troops. On the big shell dump near the station a good number of Chinese coolies were at work. At camp found plenty of letters to answer and lots of clerical work to take in hand. The quantity of paper used in the army is wonderful! Right back here seems very far away from the War and it is hard indeed to realise what we were up against only a few short hours since. Our typewriter hard at work keeping returns etc. up to date and dealing with correspondence.</p>
