<p>7-5-19<br/>After a good sleep &amp; bath &amp; breakfast at 10 (porridge egg &amp; bacon 2 &frac12; fr. bath 1 fr. dinner 4 f) I set off to see the town.</p>
<p>The town is divided into Hauteville. The old wall town of history &amp; the Basse Ville &ndash; the town which has since developed. The port across the river being known as [Capeuere]. The fisher folk still retaining their peculiar &amp; distinctive areas espec on Sunday lie in a quarter to themselves.</p>
<p>The streets nearby railway are disgusting filthy &amp; if they had much hot weather &amp; less rainfall the whole population would be swept off by disease. Still I should say that this is due to the crudeness of their ideas of sanitation rather than filthiness for in some things they are scrupulously clean &amp; the absence of inspectors of nuisance in our own towns would let a number of dirty conditions spring up</p>
<p>The old town is the more interesting The old ramports still remain as a pleasant walk covered in shade by rows of trees planted upon it, &amp; scattered throughout its length are seats to rest the weary limb &amp; often used by lover where Mdlle has managed to slip away from work for a little while to discuss some matter of vital interest only to themselves.</p>
<p>The walls are [50] &amp; 60 ft</p>
