<p>The heat was awful 112&deg; in the shade, and my things and panniers were dumped all over the place, and my staff was done up and the Dr lying in the shade and after about 2 hours swearing  cursing, and sweating I erected my Medical Tent and commenced treating the many cases of sunstroke.</p>
<p>Tuesday 16th May<br/>We are camped on the very spot where 14 mo[nth]s ago the Indians drove Djemal Pasha and his army back from Egypt. Turks and Indians are buried all around us. Next to us are the remainder of the Tommy Yeomanry who were so disgracefully cut up by the Turks three weeks ago, we are leaving here at three am in the morning on foot to march to the scene of the fight and they are being sent back, before we left I had the happy opportunity of meeting my two old units, The 1st LHB and the 1st ALH, who are both here and were going further out than us, tired dusty and thirsty we finished packing our unit on camels by Twelve and then lay down to sleep for one hour.</p>
