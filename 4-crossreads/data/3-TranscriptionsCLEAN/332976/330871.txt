June 19179th   Sports were held at Bancourt this afternoon by the Divisional Engineers & Sig. Coy.   It proved a magnificent success & the 15th company came off very well.   I was in the tug-o'-war team, which came out first after beating the 14th F. Coy.The weather which has been gloriously fine of late, changed to-day & light rain fell during the afternoon although it did not last long.   The heavy bombardment up north between Ypres and Armentiers still continues, and news has come through that the German salient there which he has held so long has been forced and our line straightened with heavy losses for Fritz.
