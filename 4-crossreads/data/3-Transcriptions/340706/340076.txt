<p>122<br/>pleasantest day I have spent here</p>
<p>The enlightened tone of the conversation was in itself fascinating while the eager &amp; active part taken by the quick witted women was a revalation.<br/>As I said before one cannot appreciate the race which is greater than even the English race, unless one can fluently speak the language.</p>
<p>21-4-19 (Mon)<br/>Again I find myself on the billeting stunt &amp; in afternoon receive a letter from Capt E R Holme &amp; immediately forward another S40 form as all previous ones seem to have gone astray.</p>
<p>I then visit my friends &amp; find several ladies present &amp; a barrister brother in law from Abbeville who gives me some good information re law. The conversation between the ladies of whom there are about 7 is quite different from our talk being of a breadth &amp; depth not usually associated with women while the male element is as mercurial as a schoolboy &amp; as light.</p>
<p>We see the avocat off &amp; then I return to mess at 6.30 as I do not wish to burden them with my presence for dinner</p>
