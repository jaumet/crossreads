The huge palace which houses our men was built for a hotel, but was never a success as the owners couldn't get a wine licence!

You have most probably heard of these &ndash; one was Luna Park, a sort of wonderland city where men were lying on mattresses even in the chutes &amp; on the track of the scenic railway.  The train runs right to Heliopolis which is a boon for our poor wounded.
