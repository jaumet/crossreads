<p>Use the same address it still holds good as all letters come to Egypt first.<br/>N.D.S.</p>
<p>319 6th A.L.H.<br/>Ma'adi<br/>Egypt</p>
<p>4th Aug 1915</p>
<p>My dear Aunty<br/>I received your welcome letter last mail, was very pleased to hear from you, I have received a good many letters from you I could not say how many, I am turning over a new leaf &amp; writing as many letters as possible while in camp.</p>
<p>I will only be here another few weeks, as I am going back to the Dardanelles again, I have quite recovered from my wound &amp; my hand is just as good as ever. I was in hospital nearly six weeks on account of septic poisoning setting in, also the tendon of my first finger was damaged &amp; the bone behind the knuckle penetrated but not broken.</p>
<p>I think I told you in my last letter that Charleie was wounded anyway I expect you have heard from him by this, he was badly</p>
