<p>1st Field Amb'ce<br/>1st Aus. Brigade<br/>1st Aus Division<br/>Lemnos Island<br/>10 Nov 15<br/>My dearest Sister Irene,<br/>Just received your letter from Fremantle &amp; it was nice to hear from you &amp; know you had reached Australia safely. I have written to the Anglo-Egyptian Bank &amp; asked them to send me the &pound; 3- you were so kind as to get Nancy Norris to send me, representing your Balance with the London Branch of the Coml Bk. &ndash; I missed you all horribly after you left.<br/>I think I wrote and told you about the cancelling of our projected Nile picnic. The 4th Field Amb. told me that Col Buston had gone away because he had not been too well. So I expect he [deleted] is still well. I hope [deleted] by now with you &amp; won [deleted] back here. I hear that [deleted] has been reduced to [deleted] but don't know [deleted] Capt MacKenzie got [deleted]</p>
