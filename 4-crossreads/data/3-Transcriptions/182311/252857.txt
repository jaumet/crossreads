<p>its story; What has happened to so and so, and then came the casualties. Robby, one of my raiders who always played the tin whistle in the German trenches; the Bombing Corporal, a plucky merry boy; Little Darkey, one of the nuts always talking, joking all the time.&nbsp; These and others I heard their tales, from others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Then with Treb., I took a look over the ruins of the town, what giants had done this?&nbsp; Well, here is one of the smaller ones, a fifteen inch &quot;dud&quot; standing almost shoulder high, a foot 3 inches in diameter and worth over a hundred pounds.&nbsp; The German dugouts, lined, tapestried, with upholstered lounge and one in particular, scented, luxury that hardly seemed in keeping with war.&nbsp; All the time Fritz kept up a desultory shelling but without effecting any damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; While out this time, I visited a famous obser-vation point high on a hill, before the war it was a famous tourist&#39;s look-out, now from it one has a view of nearly twelve miles of the battle front.&nbsp; With the map in front of us Treb and I named town and village, stream and hill, mark-ing as we did so some of the most famous names of the war.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The prospect includes many square miles of ground recently captured from the enemy xxxxxxxxx and the sight gives one confidence that the victory is going to be ours, and one feels too that the victory will not be unduly delayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I write tonight, the din is constant,</p>
