 Did not go Church too Hot & my feet are cut by the rocks while bathing so read & wrote letters. I hope they reach their destination but one feels many don't these days. 
 Meetings are held to WIN the WAR here - but hot air a lot. A Soldier's life is now one of WORK, WORK  little praise  & much toil, & men who could will not enlist.  Many Englishmen are in good Government billets here. I went to the UNION Club for lunch, it was crowded with able men in mufti.
