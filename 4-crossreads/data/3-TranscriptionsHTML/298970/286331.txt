<p>"C" Section men have been sent to the trenches whilst our "B" Section are running baths at Erquingham.  Wounded are now coming in from the line.  Our billet is a concrete floored loft in a huge two storey building.  Heavy guns kept me awake for hours.</p>
<p>12th July (Wednesday)</p>
<p>Nothing to do all day &ndash; writing etc.  More of "B" &amp; "C" Sections sent to trenches.  Wounded continue to come in, some in fearful condition.  Conversing with "Tommy" Artillerymen this afternoon.  They say that before the Australians &amp; New Zealanders came to this part of the front things were pretty quiet.  A kind of understanding seems to have existed between the Tommies &amp; Fritz.  If one didn't fire the other wouldn't, but now the Australians have started knocking things about.</p>
