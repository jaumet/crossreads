<p>had to be tied on to the clothing of each patient.  Much to the surprise of the Sentry he was marked for a "Stretcher" &amp; thinking a mistake had been made he remarked to the Colonel, that he did not want a stretcher that he could walk. The Colonel turned to the Ward Doctor &amp; said This man must have a stretcher, see to it. However when the time came for removal, the Sentry got up, dressed in tunic &amp; pants &amp; awaited the arrival of the stretcher, but just before the Ambulance came he quickly had to get on to the stretcher &amp; was covered with a blanket, for the Colonel himself was seen to be coming along himself to watch the "cases" go. Looking at the sentry being placed in the motor he said, You'll be alright now.</p>
<p>Although glad to be going to "Blighty" we felt sorry that two or three were left behind, but knew they would come later &amp; we thanked each &amp; every one very warmly &amp; hoped we would only have the good luck to go to a Hospital to receive the same kind and attentive treatment.</p>
<p>The ambulances moved off amidst the expressions of good luck &amp; best wishes, and in half an hour we were alongside the Wharf and at once placed on board a "Red Cross" steamer, the "Newhaven".</p>
<p>Walking Cases on deck, Stretcher cases below. Carried off the wharf stretchers are sent to the lower decks by means of a "shoot" which is so quick &amp; arranged so well that you are no sooner on than you are carried gently to a bunk. The Sentry chose a top berth &amp; managed to climb up without assistance. The steamer started immediately afterwards &amp; by looking through a port hole we could see the "Newhaven" was being escorted to Dover &amp; also seemed to be running between lines of Gunboats &amp; drifters.</p>
<p>Nearing England we ran into a fog which caused the vessel to slow down. Almost every few minutes from out of the fog would come a Destroyer</p>
