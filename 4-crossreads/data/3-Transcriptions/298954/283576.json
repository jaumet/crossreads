<p>1918<br/>Thu. 21st Feb.<br/>The concert last night was followed by disaster.</p>
<p>Had today been promoted from a cane lounge to a hammock owing to a fresh rush of scurvy patients and as I was clambering up somewhere near the roof the hammock ropes snapped and I was precipitated right on top of a scurvy-stricken son of Han sleeping right underneath.</p>
<p>The ebony-hued one yelled, as also did dear old Webbie as he rushed around looking more than ever like an angular old female in his long kimono and weird-looking blanket-hat.</p>
<p>Moans and morphia this morning &ndash; I blamed the fall last night and Webbie blamed the large feed of dried potatoes and "Mrs Crippen" I insisted on eating yesterday.</p>
<p>I was strapped into a coffin-like stretcher and carried forward again feeling very low and [indecipherable] &ndash; tearful almost.</p>
