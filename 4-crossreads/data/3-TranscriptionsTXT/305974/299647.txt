14 ThursdayA very cold morning, the coldest I have experienced for a very long while, well in fact it was very cold all day.  I had a tooth pulled out in the morning, now my gum is rather sore, it was a very long tooth & took a good while to pull it.  A & B sections went for a route march in the afternoon, on account of my tooth I didn't go.  Rained all the evening, mud is everywhere.
15 FridayDetailed to stand by for fatigue but none cropped up & we hadn't anything to do all day bar read a couple of papers.  We get fatigues every other day.  C section took over the divisional baths last Tuesday.  It is a lovely day today after the rain.  The 4th Fld Ambulance played the 12th field, football in the afternoon which resulted in a draw, each scoring 5 points.  Went for a walk round the town in the evening with Billy Freeman.
16 SaturdayThings were very quiet during the morning, did nothing but read.  The days are very cloudy & cold now.  General parade held at 2 pm & the latest style of gas helmet issued.  They are entirely different to previous issues & it only takes 6 seconds to adjust them ready for a gas alarm.  Fell in 6.45 pm & went by motor to Dickebusch (about 5 mls  We went through the gas at Reninghelst to test our new gas helmets.
17 SundayWe are now about 2000 yds behind the firing line, in the advanced dressing station.  Things seem to be very quiet here   a gas picket of 13 men has to be kept here, so as to give the alarm of gas.
