This was extremely nice of him.  In fact he went out of his way to be agreable. I am afraid poor man his position is so precarious that he is anxious to seize any means in his power of making friends. I asked him about the future of the campaign but he was very guarded in his reply saying 'There are events in the air but I do not know if I am right in telling you as mucheven as this'  Personally I do not think he himself knows what the decision of the Cabinet will be. They have sent Dawny home to explain it but a more unfitting choice could hardly have been made. Dawny is ignorant and stupid.</p>
