We trained from Alexandra to Cairo about 90 miles. the line runs almost the whole way through green fields of a sort of clover, studded, in many places, with palms, the country is all irrigated and the green stuff grows very rank. the fields here are the greenest I have ever seen. from Cairo we trained to Abbassia about 7 miles out of 9 then had to march 1 miles out to camp. Abbasia camp is in a very cosy corner of the desert between the Nile the Canal. composed of dust and gravel. a beastly place all round, there are very extensive barracks, on two sides of the camp. fine comfortable stone buildings, filled to the brim with terrices, there are I am told about about 40000 of them round about Cairo. I went to town one evening, got mixed up in the native quarter a bit, did not think much of it. I have not had a chance to see the city by day. it's a big place with plenty to see in it I guess will take some walking to get it.
