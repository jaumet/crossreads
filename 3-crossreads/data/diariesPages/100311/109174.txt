in front. All the transport lines are situated hereabouts and at them are all the odd details of each Regiment. Deducting a fatigue of 75 men I now have available for fighting a battalion of about 450. Our 100 casualties and the details at Caestre of course account for some of the balance. Though flat and devoid of any hill features the country round here must have been very interesting pretty. Just now with the advent of winter the trees are starting to shed their leaves. At 11 am we received a message that the two flanks were on their objectives and rumour has it that from their pillboxes the enemy are ?kamerading" freely. But your wounded here is always discursive and his impressions gleaned in excitement are not always the most reliable and trustworthy. A man lies unconsciously one finds. Our lines of advance are very definitely laid down in the operation order and we shall have to make some reconnaisances today to ensure being able to get up. Wounded say our people alright
