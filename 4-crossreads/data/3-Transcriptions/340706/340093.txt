<p>on surreptitious leave. This night I would have stayed out all night if I could have found a congenial companion</p>
<p>7-8-19<br/>I decide to pay a last visit to quant little Montivilliers &amp; visited all places shown on p.c. The Bois a thickly wooded sunken road with a sheen on their newly shed leaves which embrace all shades of green is glorious. All the way on the right land dips into a gully cultivated on both sides &amp; cut by a railway line on which few trains ever run perhaps for fear of destroying the rustic beauty of the place.</p>
<p>8-5-19 (Thur)<br/>Orders for embarkation remain unchanged. Baggage is collected at 9 am. &ndash; I ask for a coat from Scanlon but he is unable to issue it though he he QM so I ask a cpl Q.M. Coy &amp; he at once gets me one</p>
<p>At 3 pm we fall in &amp; are embarked on lorries. The men</p>
