Somewhere in France23rd August 1917.Part VIII - 9th. August, 1917, to 22nd. August, 1917.   Leave to England.
Dear Mother & Father,
Now that I am back in France & have plenty of time at hand, I will endeavour to give you a short description of my glorious holiday in Blighty.On the 8th of this month I received the glorious news that on the following day I would proceed to England on leave. You can imagine my feelings, after waiting so long for this trip.  I reported at the Ordinance Stores & obtained a new uniform,  & at 10 a.m. on the 9th, I proceeded by car to -----   & boarded the train for Boulogne. It was absolutely a miserable trip, a very slow journey, six hours to get to Boulogne. The journey should have only taken about two hours. At the station I full expected to march straight to the boat, but also it was not to be, the train load of leave men had to march to the rest Camp fully two miles away, & being up hill at the way & carrying heavy packs, it was some march believe me. Next day reveille at 2 a.m. & we marched down to the wharf & left Boulogne for Folkstone at 8 a.m.  The trip across took about two hours, the channel being rather choppy, & quite a number of the troops were sea sick. Arrived at Folkstone about 10.15 a.m.
