 Dear old Fat Bill 
 I never wrote very much last Sadurday because I had to hurry up and get ready to go over to plumpton sose I could play cricket with the other boys.  Ruth and I never went to school yesterday because we have colds and we are not going to day.  Yesterday Mrs Shore, and Mrs mickvea and Mrs Mickdonnel, came up to our place for dinner and went over to Grandmas for afternoon tea. 
 Have you seen the king and queen yet.  I hope you have not made love to on of the nurces yet because it is not time yet
