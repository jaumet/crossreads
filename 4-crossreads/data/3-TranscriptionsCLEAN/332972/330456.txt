Complain. Do they treat their Prisoners any better (State account) As the life within this Camp wher allmost unbearable, a good few Internees preffered death than to remain inside the Barbwires. So 3 Internees cut the Barbwire surrounding the Cowpark at 3 p. m this afternoon  &  made a bolt dash across the open fields to reach the bush at the Bakground of this Camp. The first 1 got through the wires suxcessfully, but the third second got entangled. The lighthorse Sentry on seeing 1 Internee running fired 2 shots, but both lurkily missed. theirupon he covered the one who got entangled with his Rifle untill the Police arived, wich arrested him  &  placed him in the Lockeys charged with trying to desert  &  no doubt he will be sent to Darlinghurst Jail. About 12 lighthorse Guards  &  15 foot Soldiers went in full pursuit about 3 minutes after the Internee got through the Wire, so his chance to get very far wher remote. About 1/2 hour after 2 lighthorse Guards  &  one Police Sergeant wher seen to lead him back towards our Camp. Every Internee pittied this Internee on his stiff luck, so he wher taken to the lockup Police Station  &  charged theirupon placed in the lockup. While this proceedings wher going on  &  the Guard looked in the direction wher the Pris wher taken back another young Internee climbed over the 3 rows of wire fence, crawled upon his hands  &  knees for about 30 yards  &  climbed up between the six galvanised Frontanks wich stood upon a wooden structure about 7 feet high, their between he remained unbeknown to the guard  &  awaited darkness, as he only need to negotiate 2 more single barbwires to make his escape compled. Becourse n Internee wich had asisted  the 2 Internees, who suxcesfully escaped yesterday, as previously stated, wher taken out of the Main Compound  &  placed in Singh Singh. 1 April.
