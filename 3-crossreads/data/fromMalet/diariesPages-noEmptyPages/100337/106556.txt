The European population of the island is mostly portugese, How they all get a living I cannot say, the island on what I can see of it from the ship seems to be a very barren place & absolutely free from vegetation.

One battleship of which I do not know the name & H.M.Auxiliary Cruiser Ophir are in harbour here. The Cruiser Ophir was at one time the Kingâ€™s yacht, but since the outbreak of war she has been turned into an Auxiliary cruiser. She carries 8 guns, 2 on each side, 2 fore & 2 aft.

We weighed anchor & left again at 6.0 o`clock after a brief stay of 4 hours. I could not go ashore as no leave was granted. The reason for stopping here was to take a Sailor from the Cruiser - Ophir on board, He is being invalided home to England suffering from some sickness or disease.
