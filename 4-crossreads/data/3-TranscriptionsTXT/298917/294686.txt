A British warship is abroad a pretty congested ship with her full crew &amp;  the conditions on the Sydney with all the survivors on board passed description. The German wounded had been uncared for for days. All the Emden's medical comforts having been destroyed in action. The only large space in the Sydney that could be rigged as a hospital was in waist &amp;  here The Germans were laid side by side &amp;  given every care possible to add to their comfort. The Empress of Russia afterwards met her &amp;  took half the wounded and prisoners. The ships in this convoy naturally wished to give a hearty reception to the cruiser that had cleared the Indian Ocean of its worst scourge but the wish of all on board the Sydney forewent that demonstration. no one had any wish that any sound of cheering should reach those lying in the Sydney's waist. Only one ship in the harbour a New Zealand transport which possibly not received the message broke this rule. The Sydney came up the lines of transports into the roadshead in absolute silence. The Emden's casualties are not known &amp;  possibly never shall be, They are Stated to be 12 officers &amp;  119 men killed &amp;  three officers &amp;  55 men wounded. About 8 officers &amp;  140 men were not wounded. The Sydney managed to transfer most of those not seriously wounded to another British warship at sea. The Sydney lost three killed &amp;  one mortally wounded &amp;  12 wounded also.
