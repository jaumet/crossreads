November 25, 26145.A cold clear windy night.  Midday the first snow of the winter - light pellety stuff, that lived only a few minutes on the ground.
Spent the evening with A Section, round a heaped log fire in the centre of their high square billet:  talking with the new L/Cpl. 4th Divy chap - Egypt, Marseille and the Somme.
No Mail.
Fatigue - a job of four days - cleaning steelwork and harness with Transport:  with Tommy Barr.. a fine chap.  Too cold and comfortless for reading lately - when I've had the best collection of books since Wimereux last year.
146.Missing:  the sandbag of books - 'Ginger Mick' with all the old autographs - 'My Childhood', and "Romance of Zion Chapel".  Last seen by Bob S. on No. 4 G.S. Wagon.
147.  November 26An 'Interim' letter to Mother - a description of Madame's Kitchen:  in the Flemish style.. writing here with Dick H...
Tommy Barr out with horses so harness fatigue off.. section out for route march.. full pack up...
148.  November 26, 27Evening:  This afternoon to Desvres with Johnny and Buckholz.. to the baths.  Early only a few in, then later 8th Batt. players after an Aust. Rules game against the 5th Batt.  Fresh from the game to the baths - white shorts and thin cotton jerseys.  In the water and out they were like young Kings.. full of rich close-muscelled vitality.  The water cold but fine.
Tomorrow we move:  the word only to the Billets an hour ago.  Haversack carries... 'Stray Birds' and 'Sacrifice' of Tagore:  and Masefield's 'Good Friday' and 'Phillip the King'.  The rumour says Courcelette, 10 miles away - closer by 10 miles to Boulogne.. and taubes.
QUEHEN   November 27
149.Now within easy reach of Boulogne:  somewhere about 2 kilos from main Boulogne road 23/4 kilos from Pont de Brique...  A leaving Bois St. Julien early - after innumerable coffees and Rhum at Madame's, at 9 a.m. and an arriving here about 4 p.m... to the best Billeting we've had in France....a fine stable building, new built and clean.  A. Section now drawing for places, so ours is the pick of the buildings...
The day cold and dull..
