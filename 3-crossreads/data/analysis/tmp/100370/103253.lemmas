 1st May The day befor yesterday , on the 29th April , we got word we were move at 11-30 PM on a stunt across the Jordan . At eleven the order was given to har up and hook in , but it was quit 1-30 on the 30th befor we move . A tremend amount of transport had alreadi gone on ahead , and for a while there was some difficulti with the pontoon bridg . Howev we were final we got over , cross the Wadi Nimrin , and proceed along the bank of the Jordan . We were just across the Wadi , when the fight began on our right . Machin gun and artilleri was veri activ , and hand grenad were be use unspar . This was , I believ the 60th Div. attack . This would be , rough , somewher about 3 AM. One could see the burst of flame and the roar hear the roar of our big gun in support , and mark where they struck on the hill . Also , the flash of the Turk artilleri in answer could be seen , and high in the sky the spurt of flame from the explod shrapnel . The morn star yellow and lumin , be just abov the horizon , the moon just pass the full , rode seren in a perfect sky , silver the plain over which we travel . Onli on earth was their conflict . We follow the cours of the Jordan for some six or eight mile , but were late get into our posit . All the star but the morn star had fade , one by one , and the dawn was pink and red in the East befor we final pull up in a Wadi . We were rais a tremend dust , and I for one expect a few littl attent from our friend the Turk . We went to the wrong place in the wrong way at first . We have a faculti for do that and we general live up to our reput . An irat Major evid share my view for he came up and hasten us into our "possi " declar we would draw fire if we were not quick . It was broad daylight when we final pull up . I lay down at my hors 's head in my overcoat and had just drop off into sleep when I was call for a cup of tea . The dust had been fear and everybodi look veri queer in the morn light . Everyon had white eyebrow , and eyelash and hair , and when dark eye look out from under the dusti eyebrow it had a peculiar appear . We stay here near all day . The Brigad had few casualti . At about 3 o'clock we were on the move again and pull in alongsid the Wadi Nimrin where we now are wait , I believ , to proceed to Es Salt . Jacko is still hold on to his posit on the Es Salt Road , though I hear the Town fell last night . The Infantri had a veri bad time last
