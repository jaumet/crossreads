<p><u>Saturday 1st May.</u>  The usual morning duel Gaeben V. British fleet advanced a stage further at 4.30 this morning.  No damage done to British side opponents damage, if any unknown.  One shell dropped perilously close between the P. of Wales and us.  At 5.30p we moved further out to allow a hospital ship to take up our anchorage.  The shooting of big guns &amp; musketry continued throughout the day, sometimes vicious, sometimes slack.  Aeroplane reconnoitres continue to be carried out daily.  We have been told that when the aeroplanes pass over the Turkish lines, the Turks cease firing</p>
