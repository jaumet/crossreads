<p>live with fish.  Never have I seen so many at once.  Within &frac12; a mile radius you could hardly see 5 yards where there was not splashing in the water, dozens of fish.<br/>These fish are up to 1 foot long and resemble tailer.<br/>The natives have nets about 20? long and these they throw overboard and pull up hundreds.<br/>Looking round we can see guns protruding from every headland. On one there are 5 big guns side by side</p>
