lef[t] at 8:15 arrived 2 a.m. nearly a gonner twice once coming through Boulingcourt a shell burst in a ruined house alongside the Road & a Piece of brick came down on my helmet. good old tin hat, the other was here, men just going to get into dug-out when shell landed 3 yds away on the other side of the sunken lane thought we were all gone but I only got small splinter in the side of the knee & my face covered with phosforus,One man wounded & my mate got a hit in the neck & face a very close shave & am looking at the shell hole while I write this & wondering how we escaped, had a hot time all the way in & the noise was fearful, hundreds of guns firing from our side also fritzs.Marched almost 8 or 10 miles but in Battle order no Packs. Had to sit up all night no room to lie down three of us in dug-out. shells still passing over us.Owing to the rain the Roads are awful & the mud like glue. hope we get out alright.Just before getting here fell down a 15 ft. trench & the old tin hat saved me from smashing my head, "Oh it was a bosker night.
