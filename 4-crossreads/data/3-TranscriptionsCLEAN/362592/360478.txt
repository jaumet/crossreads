G. Colquhoun,Solicitor.103 Elizabeth Street,Sydney.  188
Up'ards!A perky night was a comin downAs a young chap past through a country town;In his fist he clutched a tattered flag,An' this 'ere motter was on the rag -"Up'ards!"
From under his old tile's battered rimHis dark eyes flashed like a tallier glim;He lookt not to left, he lookt not to right,But continnerly hollered with all his might -"Up'ards!"
Three times thro' winders did he seeThree sevril families takin' tea;He smelt the cakes, yet never swerved;But as he dropt a tear observed -"Up'ards!"
Says a cute old feller - "young cove take care,"There's a rotten old pine tree fixt up there,"Sure's eggs is eggs, it'll fall on yer head."The young man only winkt and sed -"Up'ards"
