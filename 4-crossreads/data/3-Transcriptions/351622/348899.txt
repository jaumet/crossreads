<p>3 October 1916 Tues<br/>Called in Mr. Koeffers dug out which is just above mine. He too has the military cross. Always call in to see my old friend the cook who is just starting the fires going at 4 am to get a hot cup of tea. Fatty takes a chit for twelve &amp; is turned down. Canteen.</p>
<p>4 October 1916 Wed<br/>Struck Tom Barry whose dug out is about 6 doors up from mine. The first time I have seen him. Have a few casualities on &amp; off all day. The 19th Batt. are making a raid to-night. It is raining &amp; very dark. Big bombardment at midnight lasting for an hour or so.</p>
