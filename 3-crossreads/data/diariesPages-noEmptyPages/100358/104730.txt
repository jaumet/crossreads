flocked out and said all kinds of things we could not understand. The kiddies were funny too. Lots of small girls boys stood at the salute quite solemnly, while the column passed. The soldiers were dressed in quite an art shade of grey, with bluish putties. The N.C.O's and Officers are more adorned. The roads are cobbled and marching very tiring. My feet tingle throb after a few miles of it. Of course we travel with all we own on our backs, and 24 hours rations in our haversacks. Boulogne has not impressed us. The architecture is very poor class indeed, and things seem dirty and now at all sanitary. But we did not see the best part of the city.
At midday on the 17th we entrained for Etaples, a coastal town about 25 miles north of Boulogne. The travelling was slow and uncomfortable. The 3rd class here is obviously only meant for peasant passengers. The seats are uncovered wood, and the floors steel. Oh! how cold our feet got. This is not a particularly interesting trip. We were struck tho?, with the number of British soldiers seen all the way, busily engaged with transport duty. England must have an enormous army here now. We passed a large foundry works and saw all the women working the trucks and slag heaps. They are very merry bright. Their dress is rather unique. They have dungaree black or brown large baggy trousers, and a large apron. 
France is in this war heart and soul all right, and we are surprised at the enthusiasm and cheerfulness of the people after two years of it. But this cheerfulness must not be misread. It spells determination, and in the village of Etaples these same women may be seen on Sundays, going solemnly to mass, dressed in black. France has paid dearly with her men. About 2 hours brought us to the station.
