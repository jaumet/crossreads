<p>Thursday August 23rd<br/>Very windy, cold day. The wind is very strong, nearly blow you away as soon as you step outside of the tent.<br/>There are about two thousand men here waiting to go back to Australia, &amp; about seventeen thousand altogether, so I suppose we will have to wait a good while before we get a sight of the boat.</p>
<p>This camp is in a very desolate part, &amp; the sooner I get out of it the better. I do not intend to go out to Portland or Weymouth, as climbing the hill back would be too much for me. The food we get is fairly good, &amp; on a whole the camp isn't too bad. It is run by non-commissioned officers, so there is a bit of "red tape". Went to a cinema in the Gym this evening, not too bad, the film kept breaking every now &amp; again.</p>
<p>Friday August 24th<br/>It is still very windy &amp; cold. My word it did blow &amp; rain last night. I was expecting the tent to blow over any minute, about seven in the lines blew over. Everyone is anxious for the expected boat-rolls to come out. Two more are expected out very soon, but then there are a terrible lot of rumors getting about. All camp is closed for leave until further orders. There is plenty of amusements in camp. Concerts etc are held in the Gym everynight.</p>
