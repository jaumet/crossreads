<p>Mar. 11<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful day. Budge came back from Paris leave last night so I spent the morning hearing his experiences - we did&#39;nt go out to-day - I went to Steenwerck in the afternoon &amp; bought writing pad etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mar 12<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We did&#39;nt go out again to-day - lovely day - Joe &amp; I walked up to 18<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;battery in the afternoon &amp; we went to the pictures at the park in the evening - Joe got some tucker from 1<sup><u>st</u></sup>&nbsp;A.C.T.S.C.</p>

<p>Mar 13<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We took an engineers party up to Wychatte (on left of Messines) &amp; &nbsp;waited all day for them, we took a walk all over the joint. looked at the mine craters etc. Fritz came over &amp; left a curious trail of smoke in his wake which &nbsp;stayed in the sky &amp; did&#39;nt lose its shape for one hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mar 14<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We went to Strazeele on &quot;roads&quot; came back &amp; hauled stone from Bailleul railhead to outside points. It rained all last night &amp; this morning but cleared up in the afternoon. heavy bombardments on both sides at intervals</p>
