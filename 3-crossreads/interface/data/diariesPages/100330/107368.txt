After having Breakfast I was called to the Orderly Room was informed that I am appointed to the position of Sanitary Engineer and Second Ambulance Officer for the Company my duties are to see to the Health of the Camp assist the First Ambulance Officer if required, which means that for the time being I will not be going Driving on the road so therefore my experiences of an Engine Driver will cease for the time being, but I will endeavour to carry on my Diary with other experiences so here goes.
While we were having Tea at 5 Pm we were treated to a magnificient Aerial Display for about  an hour. As the White Clouds in the heavens were scattered fairly low, Fritz came over with their Aeroplanes hiding behind the Clouds until they were near their Object, then they swooped down low when our Anti Air Craft guns started fireing at them, then the fun started as their were 4 Observation Balloons
