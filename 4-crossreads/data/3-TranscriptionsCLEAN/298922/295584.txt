Sunday 30th September
We go direct to Taranto. I think the journey by rail is a pretty rough one & a gang of International thieves go through your baggage. Some nurses recently lost everything - but that is a condition of active service one gets used to.
Attended Church & then made one of our Officers Submarine Guard as only a few men on board, the duty was too heavy for them. Temperature falling daily. Dear little Mother, if you were only coming to meet Dolly too, but some day soon I hope we will be back in N.S.W.
