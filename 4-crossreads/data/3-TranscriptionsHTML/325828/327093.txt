<p>There is also a huge one of Henry V111.  I believe there are only 4 of these by this artist in England.  There is also a fine painting of John Wesley.<br/>Discipline is very strict here, &amp; some of the "Tommies" (Cadets) are fine specimens of the British soldier.  There are only 24 Australian Cadets here out of the total of 250, so that we get a fairly good spin, considering everything.<br/>On Saturday last I sent a cable asking for &pound;10 to be cabled to Bank of N.S.W, London with the words "Cable ten Wales Bank London now Oxford, Jabez Waterhouse."  I find it is rather an expensive course here, as we have to both behave &amp; live as officers with the pay of our previous rank.  For instance we <u>have</u> to travel 1st Class anywhere we go; and our Mess a/cs all run into extra.  My kit pretty well wiped me out, as I had to get nearly all new clothes &amp; these latter are an exhoribant price over here now.<br/>The scenery over here is just perfect now.  The English summer is really beautiful, &amp; I have often wished Wally could have stayed over here for a while longer when he was here</p>
