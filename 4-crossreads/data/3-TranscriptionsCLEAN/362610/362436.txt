  
 Tuesday 8 August 1916 Still dry & hot. Going round units & attending a lecture at St. Ouen by the Army Chemical Adviser during the morning. In the afternoon rode out to Vignacourt to try & get refill for my electric torch & one or two other things. A heavy pull going out but much better returning.
