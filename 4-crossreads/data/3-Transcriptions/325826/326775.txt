<p>Pension Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 30.5.16<br/>Cairo.<br/>April 25th. 1916.<br/>My very dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>On Good Friday morning as I was on my way out to the Church Service I saw in the glass letter box downstairs near the lift an Australian mail for myself.  The box is always locked or I should certainly have taken them to church with me for company.  It was a very disappointing service for the chaplain resident here is in many ways a rather horrid man and he spoiled it by his bad temper &amp; actions regarding which I won't go into detail just now.  Have mentioned to you that the church is just across the road from here, well you can imagine I took very little time to get across the road &amp; nearly flew up the stairs to get the key from Madame, I didn't wait for the slow old arab lift-man to toddle across the entrance &amp; set the slow lift into motion I thought I could do the four flights quicker myself and I did I'm sure.  Well there were ten letters &amp; I was so thankful.  Father I don't quite understand how it is but your general letter seems to be a week (or rather a mail) behind Mother's of 19th March.  To get one dated 19th March on 21st of next month was rather thrilling I think it is the quickest yet that has come, though there was one from someone else I forget just now whom, dated 20th. March.  I was wondering if you posted them at the same place &amp; same time for it is very funny.  If they had been opened to be Censored I could have understood it, but they had not.</p>
