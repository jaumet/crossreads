Friday 7 March 1919Wrote 15 letters today. Have a job tonight. Not very strenuous tho.  Job consisted of a picquet at the top end of Rue de Paris. Everything was quiet & we came home at 9.30 pm. Caught two Waacs. Rained all day.
Saturday 8 March 1919Bill & I went into Havre. I was on duty but it consisted of going to the club & writing letters. Met the Waacs & went to St Addresse [Adresse] with them. Lovely afternoon after the heavy rain in the morning.
