It seems as though this war will never terminate when one sees the thousands of troops that are yet [left]
10 April 1916 MonIt is 2 am as I write these few words & as I look up & out towards the firing line I see the signals & reflections of the big guns & the noise of them is terrific. Some poor beggars are getting it to-night. Ken & myself pay a visit to see Lawrence indulging in light refreshments. Saw Horace Bircher coming through the town.
11 April 1916 TuesWent around to the estaminet at 6.30 am for coffee with Marshall Rice. After breakfast Ken & I spent the best part of the morning with Germaine & Lawrence. Slept in the afternoon. Ken takes our photoes in the back yard of the estaminet. Beautiful singing by a tommie of Sheffield Choir [tone]
