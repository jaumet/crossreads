Today we had what we call a field day (C. Section only). We struck camp and marched out a few miles onto the desert with all our gear and ambulance waggons &c Pitched camp a couple of times and practised collecting wounded &c. Drizzly rain all day. Very interesting day. The ground is awfully wet for sleeping on tonight but we have to chance that.

Much stricter regulations coming out in regard to censorship. All we can say now "I am quite well and trust you are the same" Can’t even say "we are sleeping on the sand" It may mean that we are moving again shortly, I hope so. Half holiday today. Must write some letters. Norm Robertson made acting Sergeant Clerk instead of Sergeant Banner Raining again today

Went into Ismalia on duty today for a fumigator or "lice killer". Lunched at Hotel des Voyageurs. A. Section had their field day today. Got letter from Hilda Harnett from Cairo. On night picquet tonight, from 3 to 7 a.m. tomorrow morning. We generally make ourselves some cocoa. Got two films developed. Very poor. I don’t think I shall make a photographer.

A good many "furfies" flying around today that C. Section is going to make up part of a new ambulance. C Sections of the 4th & 6th, I understand are going to do this. Had a swim in Lake Timsah again today. It is going to be a daily thing evidently an old letter of Lou’s turned up today.
