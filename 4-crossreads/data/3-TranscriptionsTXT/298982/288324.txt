Sat 24 Cooking. Went for Bathe with Bill Jenkins noon. Enemy giving beach a warm time with shrapnel & big shell. Some of former burst very close & peppered within arms length. Rum Issue. No attack came off this night. Much discussion re officers General opinion seems the same. They (the majority) are a lot of vain self-seeking selfish pigs.
