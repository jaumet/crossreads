28th AprilToday we shifted our Caravan to another section of L Comp. C.T.C., about 200 yds.This is a very good job, we have now got a dugout which is positively palatial.  It is below the ground & entrance is made by descending three steps, there are raised beds (of soil on either side & a passage down the middle terminating at a table at the head of the beds.  We cook our own food, have a boy to wash up.  No pickets to do or other duties beyond feed & watering our horses.  The only fly in the cup of my contentment is that I found a louse in my shirt this evening.  The first since April 1916.  However one is bound to pick up occasional strays amongst all these natives.Rumour of another attack
