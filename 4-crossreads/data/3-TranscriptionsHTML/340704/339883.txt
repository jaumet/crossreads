<p>December 1917<br/>Thursday 13<br/>Left Jerusalem 8 am. Genl Allenby Genl Shea and 60th Div staff were saluted as we marched past. Travelled back thro Lafta Kulomieh. Enab to Latron. Where we camped. I was advised to get ready to go to Officers Cadet School with 2 other NCOs. Order cancelled 10 pm and I was cut out only 2 to go from Regt. Very disappointed and 1 from Moascar</p>
<p>Friday 14<br/>Moved out from Latron about 9 am out on the Ramleh Road. Branched off on the road to Ludd. Then halted near El Burj. Dismounted took all our gear and marched one and a half miles where we are as infantry. Horses sent right back to Katrah. I was detailed to look after bombs. Name of this place Suffa. This rocky country far too rough for horses. Huge stones everywhere.</p>
