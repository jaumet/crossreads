very likely to leave , things were stirring early & our Artillery Units came down to the Pier.  We had everything packed up & ready & about 11 am we moved off the cases etc on to Barge. Then we left for our transport & I was lucky enough to get our cases on board before the Steamer moved off to the Outer Harbour where we layed till early morning. Things were very mixed up on board, & one could not tell what was what. The Tunisian was our Transport & we are reputed to have several distinguished Generals on board. I had a lovely refreshing hot bath & a shave before going to bed.
