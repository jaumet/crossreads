 Ras-el-tin 1st July My dear Mother Have just heard that there is an Australian mail going in a few minutes.  I sent you a registered parcel yesterday; when you receive it open it &amp; fumigate it well before touching it. The table cloth is for you, the links for Father and the studs for Aunt Katie &amp; the boys if you think they can be devided. I am afraid that the things are not much but I could not see anything more useful so sent these along.  If the set of studs should not be broken give them to one boy &amp; I'll send the others something else later on. I have 24 views of lovely Alexandria; will send them next mail: will send the films to the boys.  Hope you got the other photos I sent. Am having a jolly good time here.  Will write to you next week.  Hope you get the parcel &amp; like the things.  There is nothing to pay on it &ndash; it goes duty free. Love to Father &amp; the boys.  Suppose they are home now on holidays. Don't forget to fumigate the parcel.  The cloth is hand worked &amp; guaranteed to wash. Your loving son Rob.
