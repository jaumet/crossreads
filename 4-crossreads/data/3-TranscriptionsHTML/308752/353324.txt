<p>27th March.<br/>(The first day of a <u>great experience</u> for the 8th F. A.)</p>
<p>Revielle at 4.30 a.m. an ungodly hour to be disturbed whilst enjoying a good sleep. We moved off with a fair portion of the Division at 7.a.m. It is intended to take three days to do the journey. 15 miles first day, 16 miles second, day, &amp; 10 miles the third day. We had a glorious breakfast to start the day off with. Dry biscuits &amp; tea without mile or sugar. Our Ambulance looked well when formed up on the road with the stretcher bearers leading, the Ambulance wagons, then the Ten Division men (who look after the sick) in rear of the Red Cross Waggons, &amp; then wagons carrying our blankets etc. &amp; water carts. The whole line must have been half a mile long. All marched well up till midday,  very glad to state that we have hard ground to march on. Eleven oclock lunch. Dry biscuits &amp; bully beef. My idea is that salty beef is very unsuitable when attempting a long march, as it makes one very thirsty. Heat very severe in the middle of the day, no shelter at all from the scorching sun. Moved off again at 3 p.m. This is where the trouble begins. Great numbers of the infantry men were falling out, all the way along the route completely done up. We carry enough with rolled overcoats, water proof sheets, haversacks &amp; waterbottles but these poor beggars carry a pack, trenching tools, ammunition</p>
