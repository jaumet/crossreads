Tommies (or Scotchies) took Moquet Farm capturing about 1200 prisoners. The enemy's shelling was so hot however that they retired to a line just behind it, leaving the farm in No Man's Land. We are to leave about midday to-day for as the rumour goes some part of Ypres where most likely we will spend the winter if this rotten war continues. As you may be sure we don't like the idea of spending the winter in France, but would much prefer Sunny New South Wales. My home here was a captured German dugout well ventilated, nice and quiet and pretty safe.
