  
 Now I am coming to the best day of all.  A Sunday in an English home & the first home I have been inside since leaving Aus - so you can imagine how I appreciated it.  Twas at Mrs Sydney Robjohns at Bexhill-on-sea about 90 miles South of London - Sister Reid had friends to see down there too so we started from here early in the morning.  Such restful scenery - similar to that from Plymouth.  On arriving I loved the welcome given - I simply love home life, crave for it sometimes - Yet I toil on!  I'm thinking when I return I won't care whether I wear my welcome out with all of you but I getting away from my story.  Dinner I must mention because I haven't enjoyed anything so much for ages.  Fresh salmon, New potatoes - green peas - lettuce reddishes & all home grown. Also home-grown strawberries.  After dinner we sat on the lawn and didden't I drink in the deliciously fresh air with its whiffs of new mown hay.  Then came along some friends of Mr Robjohns a Mr & Mrs Cottrell.  How I did enjoy the conversation I had with Mr Cottrell a great man I call him with a beautiful mind like Colonel Stawell.  He has just lost a nephew in the Dardanelles a [indecipherable] poet only 29 yrs of age - by name - Rupert Brooke.  How highly these friends spoke of our Australian and New Zealand men - how generous & brave they are, I was not only in complimentry terms but straight from the heart.  Before leaving that delightful spot I had a roll in the common - in the high green grass buttercups & daisies.  How perfectly charming the English hedges - padocks & lanes are.
