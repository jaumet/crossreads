 26 11/7/16 Heavy bombarding last night, watched several aerial fights, schrapnel bursting right above us. The aeroplanes seemed to live charmed lives.

 12/7/16. Left Sailly to-day &amp; am back at Merris but only for the night. 
 Had a great time the night before leaving Sailly the people at the house gave us a little send-off in the shape of a supper. The Adjutant joined us &amp; we had a very lively time. Most of the fun was caused in trying to understand one another. They were grand people &amp; were very sorry we had to leave, so was I.
