<p>20 August 1918 Tuesday   Talaat-el-Dumm  (X to X crossed out)<br/>Spent the night here &amp; marched again at 0400 which is 4 AM for the Valley-   Still very hot &amp; dustier than ever but fewer shells about.<br/>The Culverts &amp; Bridges are nearly all repaired again that Johnny Turk blew up-  What destruction is going on all over the world.   How long??<br/>X I suppose Joe is in England now?  Alls well with Dolly &amp; the Bairn.  I get letters about twice a week. X</p>
