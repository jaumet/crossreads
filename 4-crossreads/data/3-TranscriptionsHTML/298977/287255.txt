<p>Flanders,<br/>24th September 1916.</p>
<p>My dear Mother,</p>
<p>All being well and Fritz permitting Harry and I leave here for England on the 28th.  Will write from there.  This is only to say that I received a parcel from you last night.  Two pairs of socks, underpants, tablet etc., for which many thanks.  Will you also please thank Lynette Gelling for hers, which also came along.</p>
<p>These came in very handy just now and I'll have clean socks to take to Blighty now.  It's going to worry me how I'm going to meet Billy.  He says he can only get week-end leave, and we will be travelling both ways on both week-ends.  However, must trust to luck.</p>
<p>Well I'm now counting the minutes and keeping my head low, and am too excited to write.</p>
<p>Will cable from there and get my photo taken.</p>
<p>Love to all,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Roy.</p>
