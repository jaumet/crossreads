 Septr 1915 [Note in margin:] Friday 3rd &ndash; Word received that an Austn T'port had been torpedoed by German sub. but that T'prt reached Mudros under her own steam. Few lives lost. Number lost &amp; name of T'port not mentioned. Nugget B, Hayes &amp; I went away round to Anafarta Bay About 6 or 7 miles &amp; all sandy &amp; rotten walking.
