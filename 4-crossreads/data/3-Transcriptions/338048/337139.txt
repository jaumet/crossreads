<p>a fair days work for my first day of duty for over 3 weeks. Went to bed with the news of a full day march past Bedford tomorrow</p>
<p>Friday 22nd<br/>Got ready for a big march but arrangements for taking lunch failed so all we did was a bit of a walk about 4 or 5 miles &amp; returned for dinner.</p>
<p>Afternoon was spent in having a bath &amp; getting ready to proceed on leave which had been approved. Got paid &amp; caught car to Bedford about 5.30 p.m. and found that the train for Birmingham started at 7.28 but would not arrive at Bham until about midnight when obtaining a bed would be a difficult matter. I therefore broke my journey at Leicester where I arrived at 8.30 &amp; obtained a bed at the Y.M.C.A.</p>
<p>One of our chaps has people at Leicester so he showed me around the town which was pitch dark. The measures taken against Zepps are marvellous in this respect &amp; one can almost feel the darkness. Naturally I soon returned from darkness to light at the Y.M.C.A. not before going a tram ride which was slightly amusing. I gave the conductor 1d &amp; asked her to tell me when the section was up and she then told me it was &frac12; to the terminus about 1 &frac12; miles out There soldiers travel half fare as shown on the tram ticket which I am sending home Getting a childs ticket seemed rather peculiar.</p>
<p>The beds at the Y.M.C.A. where canvas ones in the concert hall &amp; after the concert was over I got to bed arranging to be woke at 5.30.</p>
