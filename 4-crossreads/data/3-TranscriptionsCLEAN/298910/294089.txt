the Operating Tent was about 75 yds away - A lot of the Doctors & tent Division who have never been near the firing line, were in a blue funk.

Dull & foggy. Heavy bombardment continues - a lot of "Furphys" knocking about, that Bapaume has fallen but I can't believe it - we have had nothing officially - Very few lying down cases in. Got a party to take my place for a while as I heard there was to be Benediction etc in the Village Church of "Meault" which is about 3 miles away - The Rosary etc started at 5.30 - the Church was crowded mostly by that very fine body of men of Irish Guards - with a smattering of Irish Australians - finished up by singing the grand old Hymn Glorious St Patrick.
Taubs come over this way nearly every night & turn on machine Guns around the Camp, believe our airmen have retaliated & given him fits.

Fine & Frosty. Very busy all day. 1st & 2nd Division went over last night & took three lines of trenches - Fritz counter attacked very heavily but they managed to get up reinforcements
