 [Monday 18 September 1916] 
 St Annes-on-Sea.  Much better, but raining. Quite a lot of wounded men are here. Breakfast in bed &amp; every luxury.  Mr Ish senior goes to Manchester every day so Dolly &amp; I have the day to ourselves.  "Pa" offers to rent a Farm &amp; me pay nominal interest in  England - but I must go Home &amp; show you "Dolly" &amp; see how she stands Station life first- I would hate to leave you in Australia. Bronchitis much better.
