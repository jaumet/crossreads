<p>June 19 buttercups &amp; daisies sway gently to &amp; fro in the breeze. From the oaks &amp; beeches which border the Road come the horse cries of the rooks; &amp; thrushes, blackbirds &amp; robins fill the air with song.<br/>Many thoughts flash through my mind as I lie full length on the yielding grass beneath the overspreading branches of a mighty <u>oak</u>. Gnarled &amp; weather beaten he is, like some old veteran, &amp; yet firm as a rock.<br/>But now the sun lies hidden behind the cloud veil &amp; something of a quiet seems to creep in almost unawares; the wind grows colder &amp; not a few of my feathered friends cease their carolling &ndash; and here in this quiet spot I say farewell to England &ndash; the dear Homeland, but still my thoughts stray ever to "Gods Demesne" Australia! &amp; the loved ones waiting there, and let us breathe a prayer for our gallant boys in the trenches &ndash; aye - for those who die suffering silently in the Hospitals.</p>
