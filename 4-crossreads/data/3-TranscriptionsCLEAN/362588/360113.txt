 Artie has not put in an appearance yet.  We have been expecting them for the last two or three days and their camp site is all ready to receive them.  When I say we expected them, I mean that the usual rumours have been about that they were coming and of course the man in the ranks knows more about this sort of thing than we do. 
 We are going on as strongly as possible with our training.  Parade 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. with plenty of trench digging & bayonet fighting, 11.15-12.30 Lectures and musketry instruction, 5-7 usually extended order work attack & defence.  The ground is not at all unsuitable for trench digging.  The top foot or so is very crumbling and falls in badly but when you get below that it is quite firm & easy to dig & the results are quite decent.  All the men are as keen as mustard and trenches are completed in a wonderfully short time.  The attacking work is very difficult.  The only cover available is an occasional small fold in the ground which is usually quite unnoticeable until you get into it and the advance has to be made in full view of the defence.  Apart from this each time a line moves
