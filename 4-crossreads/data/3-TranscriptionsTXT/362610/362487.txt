 Thursday 28 Sept. 1916 Again most beautifully fine. After breakfast went up to the 2nd Bn. &amp; was there all the morning looking to gas measures. During the afternoon attended to clerical matters &amp; went over to the 3rd Bde. at our old position in railway dug-outs. Some artillery strafe during the afternoon.
