It is hard to be violently interested in the small happenings of life, when on a stint of the present magnitude &ndash; I am pushed up on a Hill &amp; if I live through the next 48 hours will have something to tell you I cannot write now.<br/><strike>Cuth Fetherstonhaugh</strike> is to be with me in this position &ndash; so I am in good company &ndash; can you read this scribble "ars longa vita brevis" As some of my Squadron leave first I send this<br/>Love to you all.</p>
