<p>Belgium 23/4/19<br/> My Dear May,<br/>Your most welcome letter reached me safely yesterday and I was very pleased to hear from you. Well May I have been having a splendid time over here of late. I have been to Brussels, Antwerp and Waterloo. I put a week in on the trip and enjoyed it very much and expect to be leaving here on the 3/3/19 for England en route to Australia where I hope to see you on my way home but I don't expect to arrive before June next but the time will soon fly around won't it. Trusting all are well as this scrawl leaves me,<br/>Your lov. Uncle<br/>Clarence</p>
