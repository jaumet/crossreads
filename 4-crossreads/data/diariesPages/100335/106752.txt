were off, the Anchor was dropped when in the middle of the Harbour and remained there until after 2 Pm. We all then went down and had Dinner and at 2.20 Pm the Anchor was lifted and we started away on our journey, Miss Campbell was there at the Point waving her Flag's and also others and we gave them all a parting cheer and soon was out of distance and when the Pilot outside was dropped we started in earnest and the Troop's settled down, some having a sleep and others reading. The Weather all day was close and Hot but once away from the Mainland a breeze sprang up and a heavy swell, causing the Boat to roll very much, soon upsetting the Boys and Girl's, after Tea the Wind Changed from South East North East to North West East and the spray was very heavy up forward and the Hatchways were covered over with Tarpaulin's, and all Port Holes closed and screwed down, as we were in for a rough night.
Wednesday July 30th.
We have been out 13 days from Durban travelling from 230 up 287 knots every 24 hrs, after we had been out 2 or 3 days two of the boilers in the Engine Room gave the Engineer's some trouble which brought down the mileage, added to by a heavy winds on the Port and Starboard Side and for over a week the Boat Tossed and pitched likewise rolled very much preventing all Sports and Dances being held on Deck, but still the Concert Party and Band gave several performances
