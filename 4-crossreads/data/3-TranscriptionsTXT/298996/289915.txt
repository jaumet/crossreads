Last night we were to go sapping but the order was cancelled. [indecipherable] was carried out this morning. while we were digging the Snipers gave us a bullet or so now & again. Which made the boys duck. We went for a swim this afternoon the beach was literally full of undressed soldiers. The Turks sent a few shells & sharapnel down amongst same which killed some also wounded a good many.
8.6.15I am told that there was heavy firing last night. I did not hear same. Sapping again this morning on the left flank pretty near the Turks trenches one man shot in the Back while working it went in on his right side & came out his left when we were returning from our work we ran from past the spot
