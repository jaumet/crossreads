What do you think, well this afternoon I  had to take all the men up I could find and go and chuck all the mud which we carted on to the horse lines the other day away on to one side. I knew very well when we put it there it was useless, you should hsve seen it over a foot deep and it would bog a duck. They have been issuing fair sized lots of rum lately don't the boys like it.
