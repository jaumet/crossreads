 Just a line to say I am in excellent health. Landed in Marseilles on 4 april, spent two days &amp; nights in a troop train &amp; am now here on the Sea Coast. censorship is strict so no towns are mentioned. I have plenty to do &amp; see many Australians, Mr Hingst's son, Young Ford of Wickham, Lt Morton (Dalgety &amp; Co) &amp; other N/cle people here. Vaughan has charge of our 2nd Division Camp &ndash; The Country is so pretty now, Trees in green leaf. The Cuckoo &amp; sometimes the Nightingale are heard. I wrote Grace fully so no doubt you hear some of my news at times. no one knows when the war will cease. I hope all of us here will see it through. Best wishes to the Dr &amp; yourself also your niece if she is with you G R Short
