  
 3 Commandant of a Brigade of French Artillery. There was a very fine garden of Red, White & Black Currants of which we were allowed to eat our fill. - Also there was a lovely wood which was reminiscent of some of the Scrub land in N.S.W. Eric Greenwell & Wybergh Docker are both here & look well. Saw Alister Stobo several times lately & he looks well. Had a note from Miss Wyse - She is in a hospital in Boulogne & wishes to be remembered to you. - Had a letter from Fred today written from Wahroonga. The scenery round here is much finer than further north - tho' the land does not seem nearly so rich. - Did I tell you that I saw Fred Gale about three weeks ago & he wished to be remembered to you. At the Camp we were in while in Belgium I am sorry to say we had one of our men killed. There was a 12 inch English Howitzer near us & the Germans used to try & find it with 6 inch high explosive
