Electrolytic Poetry.
If the gas is out, the maiden said, then would the electric light?
That's something I can't tell said I, although perhaps it might.
Well, if a farmer mows his lawn, what does a dynamo?
Again I shook my helpless head and said I didn't know.
I've often wondered, she remarked, how much the coffee urns?
As much, said I, as the fuel costs, that a fireless cooker burns.
But why, she asked, when it's full of dust, is the vacuum cleaner?
Why that's the same, I then explained, as a fat girl who is Lena.
For quite some time I rambled on with daffodils forlorn,
While alack, I turned around, and found the maid had gone.
War Bread
Monday's bread is dark in hue.
Tuesday's bread is tough to chew.
Wednesday's bread is worse than coke.
Thursday's bread makes papa choke.
Friday's bread's like ammunition.
After Saturday's bread you call in the physician.
But the bread that is brought on the Sabbath day,
Is enough to make any old atheist pray.
