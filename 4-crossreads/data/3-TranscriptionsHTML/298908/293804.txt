We went to the pictures best seats 5d. a bit of a change that.<br/>Am Orderly Sgt. this morning &amp; have been running all over the joint getting these men together who are being returned to their units.<br/>Weather is lovely just now hope it keeps like it till we get away.<br/>My money from Mr. Duke is in Camp somewhere so I must see about getting it shortly.<br/>Tons of girls hanging round the Camp mostly soldiers wives who have married over here &amp; are saying good bye to their husbands before they get on the boats, &amp; I guess in a lot of cases it will be the last they will ever see of them.</p>
