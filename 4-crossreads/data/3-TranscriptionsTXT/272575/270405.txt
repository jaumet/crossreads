left France again in Dec. only very slightly wounded in the wrist..  he was lucky.   I suppose when I go back there will be some of the Tanks working with us.   I want to see them at work   So far I have not seen any at all though they are at Bovington..    they came there after we left for this camp.   I am enclosing a couple of Photos with this    Some say they are good, others say I look too stern.  I am sending some more by Registered Post. and will send Instructions with them..   I had them taken at Croydon near Wallington.   I am also enclosing the photo of the "Gee" family with whom I stopped when up at Liverpool, they gave me two Photos and I am keeping one.   I have not heard anything of Simmons since I left the Battn.    I wrote to Horseferry Road and I also wrote to S. but have not heard yet he may still be allright   a lot of the 2nd Boys are here now a very large percentage were very slightly wounded.   S. was with the Lewis Machine Guns. and
