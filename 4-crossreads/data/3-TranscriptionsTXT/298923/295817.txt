31 May 1918 Friday (Whole page crossed out)I am beginning to realise that as in all spheres of life a man without influence or money is looked upon as a man of "straw" & of no consequence when Decorations go around.  I don't say I deserve any but I do say nearly all those who "pull the string" get them-   A whole "hide" & peace will be sufficient  for my share I think.We will be at it again inside a fortnight I hear.  I hear wrote HLA last mail to let him know the horses are OK.  After all I'd sooner have a good wife & man child than many Baubles.
