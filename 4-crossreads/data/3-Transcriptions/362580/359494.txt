<p>appreciate our home life.  There is absolutely no place where any sister could go to dinner nor spend the evening, so it is grand to have a sociable matron.</p>
<p>Sunday-night &ndash; two officers came in from the camp where we had dinner last Monday and we took them to church &ndash; now we have a large tent for Church Services and quite a number were there.  We still have the funny little street organ but all manage to sing the hymns with vigor.  The men of this Unit are an awfully respectable crowd, &amp; attend church services well also very little drink amongst them.  To-day three sisters &amp; three, officers are yatching on the Lake &ndash; I'm one of the three.  So you see we have plenty of amusement provided for us when off duty.</p>
<p>I seem to get very little time for writing &ndash; the time flies &amp; bed is so nice.  Hope you are all well.  Mind you write every week, even if it is only a P.C.  Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving sister<br/>Edith</p>
