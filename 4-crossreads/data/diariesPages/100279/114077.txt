just dump him over the parados for the time being, that's the end of it.
28th. Slept in till 9? oclock this morning then had breakfast. after this Bill Bayne I went hunting for souvenir's. I have scoured the country for miles miles looking for these "oyster bombs" which the Germans have, but I have never found one yet, but if perseverance will succeed I'll have one.
Some of the boys got some good souvenirs off the Germans in the shape of revolvers, watches, rings etc, but I don't believe in the way some of them go through the Tommies our own chaps you can find letters photos such things all over the battlefield.
