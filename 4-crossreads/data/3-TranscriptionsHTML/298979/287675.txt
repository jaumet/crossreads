<p>In fact in many places British Authorities would not tolerate the condition of affairs existent in almost every country town in any part of France for one moment, for the cesspits in the middle of back yards, even when the "back" yard abutts on the main street are awful, &amp; the lack of the commonest sanitary conditions even relating to the disposal of kitchen slops is disgusting.
