<p>&amp;after a run of 500 yards came to a standstill.  Thus ended my first flight, &amp; I can truly say that I saw the earth that day from an angle of observation that I'd never seen it before.<br/>My other six flights were exactly the same though of course I got more accustomed each time to the different motions of the machine.<br/>There have been several accidents since I came here.  Last Sunday week, an Officer from the 67th Squadron (English) was qualifying for his brevets. (wings, qualified badge of an R.F.C pilot.)  He was to make his first solo flight but he got out of it as he didn't feel too good.  The following afternoon, Monday, the authorities insisted on his making his solo, altho' he didn't want to.  If ever a man had a presentiment of coming evil, he did.  Just before he got into his machine, (a very fast Avro fitted with 120 H.P engines &amp; capable of doing 145 m. p. h.) he took some letters &amp; photos out of his tunic &amp; handed them to another officer standing by.  "Here, Tom," he said "take charge of these in case I don't come down alright; I don't feel too sure of myself to-night."  Off he went, &amp; started alright; he was only up about 500 feet &amp; was banking (too steeply, I thought) when the wind seemed to catch his off wing &amp; he made a bad side-slip.  Had he been up up a couple of thousand feet he could have recovered himself; as it was he crashed to earth with a sickening thud, (a thud that I won't forget for many a day)</p>
