<p>Delville Wood 14/11/16 Some men very badly wounded and shell shocked.  Came away as a splinter of shell plunged into the mud alongside.  Very heavy shells falling and in the dull afternoon their bursts showed up like fire.  A heavy battle raging.  Returned to camp and was called up to see Forbes who attached me to Divn H.Q. to represent the Bde.  All men in the camps were organised and left under cover of the dark for positions in close support.  I  remained at D.H.Q in the dugout of the Signal officer.  Livid gun flashes after dark denoted a slightly slackening battle.  Keeping communications going is a big job.  Linesman out patrolling their wires.  Heard that Brigadier General Beresford has been killed.  Fritz had some sausage balloons up today and our usual echelon plot was also up. Forbes left at 5.45 pm and handed over to me here.  A day of great battle and extremely hard and bloody fighting.  The flash of an  18 pounder is most noticeable at night and lights up the whole surrounding locality for the minute.  Found it very useful in illuminating the narrow duck boarded path round D.H.Q.  Slept in the top bunk in the dugout, the Signal Sergeant below and spent a good night.</p>
<p>15/11/16 Returned to own camp at 7 am.  A bitterly cold and raw morning, a wind that cuts like a knife, and slight traces of ice on the ground.  Padre turned up and told us Major Nicholas had been killed going up last night.  Poor old George.  DSO  and just married.  Cut almost in two.  A cold night for the wounded , some had to lie on stretchers for 4 hours.  Young Abdul (Quinn) had an awful wound in the leg and was very low.  Head wounds bleed profusely but when washed generally disclose only a small puncture.  Anything large results as a rule in an instantaneous death.</p>
