 The wall of the nativ quarter are corrod to a depth of inch with the urin of generat . Trade are all carri on in littl box like shop open to the street and the smell of fri food and garlic permeat all . Oh Hell what would I give to be home in the clean air of Sydney or Melb away from these savag and their filth . The fine hous are dream of Arabic architectur and the flat build veri fine too . But the Pest if you stop in the street dozen surround you tri to clean your boot , sell you fag , card or ani damn thing . One is alway snap out Emshi ! ( go away ) Yallah ! ( get out ) push them off onli to meet more , hideous beggar , wretch women blind with skinni babi , stretch out for the etern backsheesh . My French improv , I can carri on quit decent now , and it 's a great help here . The nativ music is most fascin , wierd , wail , desert stuff ? veri music ? to the accompany of the drum .
