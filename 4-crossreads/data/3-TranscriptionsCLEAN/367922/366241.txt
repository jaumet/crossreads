 Dear Bruce Just got your last note & as I thought its information would be of interest to Mr. Fry, I forwarded your letter to him & got this reply 
 Have been in camp seven months now passing through various stages of instructional work in the Wireless Training School. 
 I enclose photo. showing something seen on equitation last month. As our training is now practically finished we are leaving to-morrow for a protracted wireless bivouac at Barrenjoey.

 Dear Mr. Fry, I am enclosing the negatives & 3 prints of Alan's Grave. I had them done by a Frenchman when we were in the village. The photos are not very clear but better ones could be obtained from the film. 
 Yours sincerely Bruce Rainsford Staff Sergt. 14th Aust Field Amb
