<p>Mr MacNamara told me of Jacking coming out top at Hurlstone and of his going on to the Hawkesbury College with a scholarship.  He appears to be a clever boy.  He should do well under Mr Potts.  Good luck to him!</p>
<p>I have wondered if Mr Potts has returned from his wanderings &amp; has commenced work again at the College.</p>
<p>A shower of rain fell here this afternoon.  Real wet rain too!  Enough to leave pools upon the depressions in the asphalt pavement in front of Mena House.  The air felt different from any moment which has been of my residence. 9-20 p.m.  The sky is so clouded at this moment that not a star is visible, the darkness is more dense than any I have looked upon in Egypt.</p>
<p>Enough for tonight.  Good night!  Goodnight!!!  Goodnight!!!!!</p>
