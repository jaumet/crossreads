<p>Sunday May 13.1917<br/>It was cool in the morning but very hot after 11 am.  There is some artillery activity S. of Armentieres, to day.  I can hear the boom of the guns.  I put a handle in an [indecipherable] this morning for the butcher.  There was a little rain about 3 O'cLock but hot &amp; close again in the evening.<br/>There has been a new man put in the pioneers named J Hughes a Plumber in place of C. Cunningham now in England.  Sgt. Hammett was in this evening, and left orders that the Pioneers are to go back to the trenches, this time to bury the dead.  Our Battalion is to go in shortly, perhaps to morrow</p>
<p>Internal affairs are far from satisfactory in Russia.  The Admiralty assures us that U. boat menace is well under control.  The Italians have sunk 13 submarines of Austria in 3 weeks.  The Huns are again using Flamenwerfer (Liquid fire) on the W. front.<br/>[Shorthand entry not transcribed]<br/>The church in this town is badly damage with Hun shells.  I have a post card view of it &amp; several other place in this town &amp; also Pont de Nieppe</p>
