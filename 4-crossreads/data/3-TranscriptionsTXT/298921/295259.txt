October, 1915Friday 15Went for a ride to No 1 Hospital to test my thigh, it didn't break out so interviewed AAG & was lucky enough to get my name down to 9 with the next lot of reinforcements to Anzac leaving about 20th Nov. Saw Mardi for a few minutes she looked very professional in Uniform - & is well. My first night out of a comfortable bed did not sleep, heard the Picquet changing, & every horse that broke loose, but will soon get accustomed again & this is Paradise compared to the Peninsular but the flies & dust are still bad here in Camp & the Bugs are in the matting I bought.
