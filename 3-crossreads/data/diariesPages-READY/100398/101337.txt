The Lincolnaise
Oh we’ll never see the Exford any more
and we’ll never see the Carlton any more
For they’ve wrecked us on the mud
Far away from any port
And we cant go navigating any more
Then old Admiral Fremantle did he roar?
did he roar?
And he sent us off in flat-boats to the shore
Where the – niggers smiled
As in sadness we defiled
With our baggage to the Admiralty shore
We were weary & full rotten to the core
To the core!
On the mountain road a million feet or more?]
Up above the - town –
where the - - brown
Monkeys madly through the treetops from us tore
With the monkeys & the niggers of the shore
by the shore –
Eating bully beef & biscuit & paw paw - 
Oh! tell mother I’ll be there
Where they never drink or swear – 
For we’ll never see Australia 
Anymore!

13th One, a navy transport went at tea-time & was saluted by all the French ships in the lines. There’s much conjecture as to her mission; about 15 to 20 thousand pairs of eyes watched her with the same thought:
Where the deuce is the tub going to – unescorted & unarmed?
