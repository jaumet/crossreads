<p>My groom went away Sick &amp; he wrote me from Port Said thanking me for sending his Kit Bag, &amp; he said he hoped the Horses were not falling away, he dreamt he was playing with the Cob please tell H.L.A. both going strong also <u>Gunshot</u>.<br/> [Following paragraph crossed out]<br/>I hope  Charlie wont be like so many other Australians who having made their fortune in their country (&amp; from which many of them continue to draw their income) abandon it for ever, don't talk about it &amp; abandon all affection for the land of their births- We find many such in English regiments- &amp; they always make sure not to be mistaken for Australians, while we would not swap our Felt Hats for all the Helmets-</p>
