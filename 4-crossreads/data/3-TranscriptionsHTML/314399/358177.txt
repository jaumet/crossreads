<p>Sunday 29 June 1919<br/>Had lunch at Bill's place &amp; then we went to Twickenham &amp; got Mr Davison's  boat &amp; went on the river. Before going on tho we had lunch at a funny old place. Quite a decent lunch tho. Stayed on the river till 5.30 after both of us getting blisters. Came back to town &amp; had dinner. Got hit to buy too for it. We then went into Trafalgar Square, &amp; to Buckingham Palace &amp; to Piccadilly. Gee the crowds were enormous. One could hardly move. The star on Nelson Monument is up on 50 meaning 50 millions collected. Quite cold tho. Went to bed at 10.45 pm.</p>
<p>Monday 30 June 1919<br/>Cold today. Have a lovely sore lip. Did very little all day. Bill &amp; I went to pictures in the evening. They were very good. One dealt with the drunk question &amp; another with divorce. Both well staged &amp; acted.</p>
