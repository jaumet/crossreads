<p>dust which blinds one and now we wear smoked glasses on Parade. We had a days Musketry today away out 5 miles in the desert in a place called "Dreary Vale". It is a range built temporary for us. Every man has to shoot till he gets his pass which is pretty stiff, the shooting of our Company compared to what we did in Randwick was marvellous, the conditions were awful too, the wind was in our face and at times you couldn't see the target for sand to tell you the most of us fired with smoked glasses on. I surprised myself, by getting through each test first pop each time, so the first enemy we meet will get a rough time the boys are bristling to get at somebody, the training we are getting now is very advanced well if I go on in this strain the Censor will carve this note about, we have been cautioned about writing anything about our movements etc., but I think this will pass OK.<br/>Excuse the writing etc. Lizzie dear as I am writing this on my knee with a candle on a mess tin for a light and the boys sitting round smoking and yarning and every now and then they remark something to me and I stop and have a yam and go on again. My weight is now 12st 9 which considering that I went to Randwick 10.6 isn't too had and speaks for itself, regarding my health. Well ta-ta with fondest love to self R &amp; B and Dad from Your loving brother Ken</p>
