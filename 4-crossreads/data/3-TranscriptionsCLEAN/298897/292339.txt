Wednesday 9th AugustSpent a restless night, what with listening to some heavy guns nearby firing & traffic on the road.  Several 6 inch naval guns went pass drawn by caterpillar motors.  Went to a reinforcement camp in the morning to fix up their sick parade.  More German planes over today but very high up.  Our batteries peppered them well especially when over our heads, a fuse & a lot of the shrapnel falling amongst us.  One appeared to be driven to land in their own lines.
Thursday 10thHad a little excitement today in the way of a case of scarlet fever.  The whole Hospital had to be isolated patients orderlies & all.  This necessitated fresh arrangements as regards picquets etc which kept me busy during the day.  Very little doing otherwise.
Friday 11th AugustNothing doing so did some washing & mending.  Hospital still isolated & most of work going to 'B' Section.  Weather very hot.
