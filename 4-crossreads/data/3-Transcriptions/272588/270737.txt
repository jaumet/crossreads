<p>Saturday 13 July<br/>The country is looking well after the rain &amp; I have just had a walk round Sercus &amp; Wallon Cappel. Fritz was over bombing last night. A rest camp is opened for Australians at Bolougne &amp; one is to go from the section, possibly myself.</p>
<p>Sunday 14 July<br/>Wet all day. Fritzs 'planes 'were active last night bombing &amp; his &amp; our guns were busy to-day.</p>
