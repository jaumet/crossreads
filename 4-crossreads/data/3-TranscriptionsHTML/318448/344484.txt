<p>8:9:18.<br/>I passed two graves today beside the track to water, which I had not noticed before.<br/>On one of them I read R.H.  Welham &ndash; Coy RE. and underneath  the date &amp; the inscription "Killed by aircraft." The strangeness of those familiar words suddenly struck me. I paused to think. Formerly I had seen plenty of graves with all sorts of inscriptions "Killed in Action"  "Died on Service"  "Died of Wounds" "accidentally Killed" &amp; so on &amp; so forth</p>
