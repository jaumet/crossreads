<p>Booked a room for a couple of nights. Went to Kursaal.<br/>Mch 4th Have had an excellent two &amp; a half days here. Have not been doing much sight seeing this trip being rather busy shopping etc. yesterday afternoon we took the tram to Abbassia, intending to go to the Camel Corps camp &amp; look up "Cec" Jones, we however omitted to leave the tram at the correct spot &amp; consequently missed seeing him. This morning we walked for sometime through the native bazaars,</p>
