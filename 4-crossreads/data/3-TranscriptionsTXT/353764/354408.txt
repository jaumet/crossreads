 accident occurred near us to-day &amp; it was this. A party of officers &amp; N.C.O.S were being instructed in Bomb throwing from one of the trenches here. The Warrant Officer &amp; SMajor fitted the Bomb to the thrower &amp; were instructing on it, and then went to fire it as a demonstration, when something went wrong &amp; the Bomb exploded. 4 officers were very badly wounded &amp; the W.O. &amp; C.S.M were killed. The former had his head almost blown off &amp; the latter was practically disembowelled. It cast a gloom over the whole Hospital (No1) when they were brought in. I was up there visiting Uncle Charlie when they were brought in &amp; he was one of the Drs who attended them. There is still some fighting at Matruah [Matrah] &amp; it is gradually assuming larger proportions.  There are many things going on there which the people will never know. For instance as our Troops advance into the Senussi Villages the women folk cut their childrens throats &amp; then kill themselves.
