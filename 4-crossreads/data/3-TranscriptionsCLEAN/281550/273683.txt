  
  June and July 1918  On Friday June the 28th I had to see the manager of the factory. He wanted me to work on the salts again, I told him that I would work if the hours were to be the same as they were before they altered them, And if I was to work on Sundays I was to have time off during the week, He would not alter any of these, so I refused to go back. I am still working in the store rooms. 
 Saturday July 13th. 
 The war news for the week was that the Australians had taken a few small villages in the Somme-district. That the Russians are fighting again with the assistance of the French and English troops. And also the papers publish the report of the assination of the German Ambassador in Russia, It is reported that he was assinated by a French or English soldier
