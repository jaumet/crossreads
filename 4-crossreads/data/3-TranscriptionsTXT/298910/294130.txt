 Sunday  8th 1917 
 Nice sunny day. Church of England had a compulsory church parade &ndash; No R.C. Services offering &ndash; Rigging Tents etc., anything but a rest. Fortunately for us the stunt was postponed &amp; we were not called out.  On parade the Adjutant asked for the names of our squad who stuck to our post  - I daresay that is all we will hear of it. 
 Monday  9/4/17 
 Very cold &ndash; rain &amp; snow. Squaring up Tents etc all day. At 11.30 pm we the Bearers were &ndash; pulled out &ndash; pulled down enough tents for one Section, ordered to be in readiness to move off &amp; assist at some part of the line. 
 Tuesday  10/4/17 
 Blowing a treat &ndash; several snowstorms. Bitterly cold. Still holding ourselves in readiness. Got Official news that 1st Division took 150 Prisoners and the Villages of Hermies, Boursier &amp; Demicourt.
