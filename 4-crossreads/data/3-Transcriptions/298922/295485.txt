<p>BEACH</p>
<p>I've had a swim &amp; built a Bivy facing the Mediteranean just 60 yards from the waves &ndash; it is a treat to be clean again &amp; the horses should improve here. They have been falling away for the last month. No grazing &amp; too many Flies DUST &amp; not enough water. My two are still fit &amp; well &amp; not a blemish on them altho' they have some weight to carry. <strike>Old</strike> Colonel Granville left today sick &ndash; we have only &frac14; of the evacuations the Tommies have among the men. Our men spend all their money on TUCKER.</p>
