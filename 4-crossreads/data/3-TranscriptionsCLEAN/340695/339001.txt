The folk speak English splendidly & are particularly nice to us where we mess. We are the first Australians to be billeted with them. 12-8-17 Reninghelor is not far from here so I borrowed the Skipper's horse & set out to find my Belgian Lassie at the farm there. (Ha) A glorious ride & found my quarry but she was not at the farm. Received a great welcome at the hands of her sisters & enjoyed the products of the farm. My pony was greatly admired. Arrived back safely just before a fierce storm broke loose. 15-8-17. Mac went on leave yesterday his second time am waiting anxiously for mine.
