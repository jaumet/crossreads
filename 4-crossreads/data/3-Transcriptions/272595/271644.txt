<p>The country round here is very pretty &amp; the crops look real well, especially the wheat &amp; oats.<br/>20th.  Have been doing nothing all the day, but this afternoon Graham &amp; I walked down to Warminster, on the way down we met Lieut Brownlee &amp; we had a yarn with him, then went on to the town, she is built in a long rambling old fashioned way full of old houses all stone &amp; ivy covered, I never saw so many "Jacks" (M.P.s) before not even in London, this place is full of the wasters, they pulled me up twice once for wearing my hat down &amp; again for having no chin straps needless to say they got very little satisfaction in either cases.  I had the luck of the world here actually got 2 films for my Kodak, a thing I could not get for love nor money anywhere else</p>
