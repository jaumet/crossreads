<p>(Friday 26th)<br/>On fatigue this morning carrying up stores We have mess rooms here to eat our meals in. We are not going into Cairo to night we are leaving it till tomorrow afternoon when we will have more time went to bed early<br/>(Saturday 27th)<br/>Went for physical drill before breakfast and done our morning parades dinner time we are starting for Cairo as soon as we are finished. The 13th battalion are earned over the other side of Heliopolis. Cairo is a very busy place in the main part of the town. It is full of Hotels and resturants with all kinds of names dance houris and Egyptians sell chocolate and cigarettes shine boots for Vz piastre. We next went to the native quarter Goodness what a filthy place the streets are so narrow that you can hardly pass one another in places There are white Egyptians and black ones some of the women have black veils covering their faces and others have white veils. I was glad when we came out into one of the main streets again. We visited the Egyptian barracks and watched them drill. The drill very nice but the old style of drill. We had a look at the Sultans palace that is a fine building with sentrys all along the front of it. We would have went to the museum but some of the boys got lost so had to give it up as we had no time. We left Cairo early and got out at wrong stop and had a long walk back to camp Very glad to get home again don't think I will trouble Cairo much. As Heliopolis is nearer and hardly any Egyptians there at all<br/>(Sunday 28th)<br/>What a day Dust and sand everywhere you can hardly see anything in front of you. Wrote letter to Kathy but had a job writing it as the sand blocked up the ink in the pen. Am going over to see Jimmy OHagan this afternoon.<br/>There are clouds of Locusts flying about. They are similar to what we call Grasshoppers. Met Jimmy OHagan in Helliopolis and he was very pleased to see me. We both got our boots cleaned and went over to see some of the boys of old E company The are now known D company as the battalions is made up of four companies each with about 250 men and officers saw a lot of fellows I knew We had tea together in Heliopolis I got back to camp.</p>
