 29th June 1916 (con) which I hope we leave soon enough to finish the journey off. Had an impromptu concert at night which makes the monotony bearable anyway. 
 30th June 1916  Went into Dakar Harbour again this morning for coal. Washing day for our battery. Very hot day. Very antiquated method of coaling. Niggers carry little baskets full into the bunkers from the lighter through side doors. Dakar was very busy as regards shipping today. No less than 12 vessels arrived &amp; departed. The [indecipherable] a mail boat of the older Dempster line came in near us and had a no. of passengers on. Girls [indecipherable] were amongst them. Some Australians were aboard. All our ships weighed anchor at 6 oclock for departure. The Beltana went first, then the Marathon playing the Marsillese amidst cheers from the Frenchmen on the Montcalm. We were the last to go out of harbour time 7 oclock and cheers from the passengers on the [indecipherable] speeded us on our way. The "Kent" left at six oclock then came the "Swiftsure" after her the Beltana our ship Benalla &amp; Marathon last. I do not know if this is going to stay, but the "column of route" method looks much more business like. Time not 9.30 &amp; very hot.
