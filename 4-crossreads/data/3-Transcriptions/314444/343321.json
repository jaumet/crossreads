<p>Lieut Claude Benson<br/>Firing Line<br/>Gallipoli<br/>24 9 15</p>
<p>I am posting this in an envelope was sent &ndash; and hope it arrives safely.</p>
<p>My dear Cos,</p>
<p>Such a relief!   Ye Gods you can't imagine the feeling of relaxation consequent upon our being withdrawn at ten this morning for a 48 hours spell and although the rest is in a sense alleged only, the ever- present worry of the Line of Defence is temporarily abolished.  The Regiment in Reserve to my Brigade took over our main duties and our only work is the pushing forward of our winter quarters for that dreaded season is rapidly approaching and each successive night gives evidence of the fact and unearths a more decided chill than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me</p>
