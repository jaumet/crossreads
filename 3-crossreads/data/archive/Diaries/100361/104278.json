He was buzzing around till about 2 this morning. We were just settling down to try and get another sleep, when the A.S.C. trumpet blared out \"Reveille\". But we took no notice of it.

The chap in the dispensary said he couldn't give it to me without seeing the Doctor. So I saw the Doc, Capt Sampson, who marked me straight away for evacuation. So I said \"Hooray\" to the Post Office Boys and came away in a motor to 5 GG's at Proyart about 8. Had a couple of feeds aboard the Train.
