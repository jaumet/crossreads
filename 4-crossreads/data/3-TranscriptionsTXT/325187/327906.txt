[Monday 12 June 1916]
Very tired & an aeroplane alarm tried us out again.  3 Taubes during our absence used their Machine Guns & darts on our Camp- but no casualties much.Thank goodness they did not [bomb] us while we were out so far, a Stampede there & no water 2 WALK home would have Settled many-There are advantages in my scribble, No censor could read it!!Had a reply from Mrs Bradden re Billie's fez.  Our men- regretting the L.H were missed as we did not stay long at Mud[r]os after evacuation.  We missed them there & were just too late for the Egypt lot- However our boys have some good stuff coming.
