<p>Tuesday Jan 21st. SS Takada<br/>Saturday mid day we arrived at Colomba, one does not see it untill quite close, low lying country.<br/>There was no permission granted to go ashore, <strike>but</strike> on account of the recent influenza epidemic, but never the less more than half the boat did go on shore.<br/>On Sunday afternoon a friend invited me to go with him. We were loading coal, &amp; the troops were going over on the empty coal barges.<br/>On landing we found our selves near the native quarters, from there we walked to the European part of the town, It was sweltering hot.<br/>There are a good many very fine buildings in Colomba, especially the Governor's house, we sat down <strike>on</strike> under a tree outside that building to cool down, &amp; up came a native guide, who explained that he would take us round to show us the sights for a very reasonable sum, so we engaged him.<br/>We very soon got a native cart drawn by a sort of a bull,</p>
