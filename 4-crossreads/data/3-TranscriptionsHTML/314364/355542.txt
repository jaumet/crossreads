<p>The German Armistice Terms we signed on the "Lion", which was Ad.Beathie's Flagship).It was almost dark when we arrived aboard, so we could not see much of the Boat. Drew our Hammocks &amp; Blankets &amp; had Tea. Stew O Lord. We could have gone ashore after Tea, but it rained like fury, so we stayed aboard.<br/>Wed.Feb.5 It was quite exciting slinging our Hammocks last nigh; &amp; trying to get the blankets  in the right position was amusing. I slung my Hammock in the [indecipherable] portion of D deck &amp; managed to keep fairly comfortable. Was awakened this morning by the sound of women's voices. 70 of them came aboard to scrub out &amp; put things in readiness for the arrival of the Diggers. There are 199 of us on the  B.M.C. staff &amp; they seem a very decent crowd.<br/>Wed. Feb.5 (cont)<br/>The Food is good &amp; plenty. There wasn't much doing today so we had a good look around the ship. She is not a big boat by any means. After Tea I went ashore with Davis &amp; Burke. We met the ship's Corporal of the "Lion" who gave us a detailed account of the Battle of Jutland. It was mighty interesting. Judging by what he said the sailors all swear by Ad. Beattie. The Corp. said Beatties wife often went aboard &amp; had a yarn with the men. She is a daughter of Marshall Field the American millionaire. Ad. Beattie won't allow anyone else but a man-o-war's man cut his son's hair. The train ride from Keyhouse Docks into Plymouth is the longest I ever had for a penny.  It rained heavily all the night, so we couldn't see much of the Town, &amp; being wet all the shops were shut.</p>
