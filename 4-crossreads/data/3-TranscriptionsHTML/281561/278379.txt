<p>28/3/17.<br/>Went to the Corps baths at Heilly. Our ammunition was taken from us today. Had some rifle practice yesterday, my rifle is a dud will have to pinch another. We do some pretty severe marches here.<br/>30/3/17.<br/>Rain stopped Parade this evening. Two deserters from this Battalion who were sentenced to be shot were liberated today. Was offered a "bar" as a tempory Acting Unpaid, wouldn't take it for various reasons. It is bad enough to be a senior Private and have to do their work, without being entitled to the abuse.<br/>2nd April 1917.<br/>A Brigade march past this morning yesterday at Churchparade a courtmartial was read on one of the 3rd who got 10 years. A good concert in Mericourt tonight.</p>
