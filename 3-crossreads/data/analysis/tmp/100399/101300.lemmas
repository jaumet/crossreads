 The town is situat on a hilli cape of the sandi desert to the north , the hill jut straight up from the water . Some of the build are in the most inaccess place the hill are entir devoid of veget . A coupl of warship were in the bay . Here we found an entir differ kind of nativ , the Arab . We left Aden that morn after hug the coast of Arabia until 4.30 pm . Entere the Red Sea . Here was seen the grandest sight of the Voyag . The day had been perfect now the sun is set not over the ocean , but over the rug mountain of that part of Africa . To the right is the island of Perim , a naval station , beyond the next stretch of water the coast of Arabia . It is dusk the lighthous is alight flash up the Red Sea as we enter the Strait of Babelmandeb the men passeng crowd forward to watch a cabl steamer pass through the same time . It is inde the most uniqu sight of the voyag , the place where the " China " met her accid . Nov 2 After a good run up the Red Sea we enter the Gulf of Suez next Nov 3 [in margin ] morn anchor in Suez harbour where we disembark entrain for our Egyptian destin . In this voyag I consid we had the best time of ani troop which had ever left Australia in this way . The boat was kept scrupul clean the food was of the best . The passeng treat us like littl God entertain us mani time at concert kept us suppli in chocol , cigarett fruit etc . Of the English troop I have noth but prais for the manner in which they strict obey order drill . They were alway commend on the cleanli of their deck . Their money is small at port we Australian arrang collect to enabl them to have a good time . Consequ they held us in high esteem were sorri to leav us at Colombo . Their strict English offic was a big contrast to our own , demand a fullest extent of disciplin . The men are certain small of statur . Of the passeng , we have much to be thank to in Mrs B Gwynn Hugh Miss Churnsid who disembark at Port Said . Except for the second day out from Sydney the weather has been excel though natur veri depress hot in the tropic . I must say that my first impress of Egypt are not of the best as from the boat we can onli see a long stretch of undul sand . Hell entir devoid of veget .
