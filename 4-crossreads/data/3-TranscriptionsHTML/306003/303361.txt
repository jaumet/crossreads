<p>21-5-16<br/>about here must have joined the Turks &amp; that is the reason only old men &amp; women are found here &amp; the women &amp; old men act as spies &amp; let the Turks know anything they find out;  About a dozen lads made fine amusement today by climbing to the top of the sand ridge &amp; rolling down like a lot of school kids.</p>
<p>22-5-16<br/>Mon 22nd<br/>I received orders late last night to go onto the Pinnicle to signal to troops on the desert.
