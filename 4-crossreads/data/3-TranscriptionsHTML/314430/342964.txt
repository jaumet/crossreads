The first wave gained its objective, and the 18th and 20th Battalions then opened an assault on the village but were repulsed. Later reinforcements came up, and by 6 o'clock PM. our troops I afterwards learned were holding all positions gained in the battle* and the Germans were retreating towards Montbrehain. I took half a dozen prisoners, and in "Souveniring" them, I found that we had been opposed by the 222 Infantry Division. From one of the prisoners I took what I think, and as far as I can read the German text, appears to be a certificate+ that the holder won the Iron Cross, II Class, in the field on 28th August 1918. It is signed by the "Generalmajor und Kommandeur der 222 Infanterie-Division." In this affair I got slightly wounded in the foot. The pain was very keen, but I did not fall out. I stuck with the boys as long as I could. When I got through the second band of barbed wire I could walk no farther, and had to crawl into a shell hole for shelter.
