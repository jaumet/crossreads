<p>Letter written to Miss Wyndeyer thanking her for a Christmas parcel &ndash; probably the same as Miss Windeyer of the Mitchell Library, referred to on p 495.]<br/>Palestine<br/>10/1/19.</p>
<p>Dear Miss Wyndeyer,</p>
<p>Thinking that you might be interested to hear, where your Xmas parcel finished up, I am writing to tell you that I was the fortunate person. The 6th Regt. parcels were issued a couple of days before Christmas day, together with an issue of War Chest comforts &amp; hundreds of plum duffs from some other fund. The whole combined made a great Christmas dinner &amp; certainly the brightest that the Light Horse have had in Palestine or Sinai Desert.<br/>We were then &amp; are still camped at Raffa, about 130 miles north of the Canal, &amp; in sight of the Mediterranean, on which we have been watching mine sweepers at work every day. Our days pass pleasantly enough now in the thought of soon returning to Australia again. We drill all the morning &amp; indulge in football in the afternoon &amp; one of the Y.M.C.A. Secretaries usually has something</p>
