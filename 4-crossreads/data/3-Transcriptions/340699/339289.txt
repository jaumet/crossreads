<p>doubtful if there is much use in telling the authorities that for ascertaining the best methods of making models, I am in a position to consult men who know more about it than anyone else, because they don't know these men: I might just as well be reciting fictitious names. It happens that <strike>Sir Harris Conway</strike> C's right hand man is a friend of strike>Fullwoods</strike> F and <strike>Oswald Birley</strike> B an old acquaintance of mine and a friend of <strike>Alan</strike> A's while <strike>Poole</strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P who is at Hyde Park is well known to me. These three are at the top of the tree and from them I could get such advice as would make me better equipped than any one of them singly. But I'm afraid the authorities would be ignorant of their names and I might just as well say Brown, Jones and Robinson. My stretcher is made and tomorrow I go out to the woods to do my painting. I hope the weather will clean up and give me a clear run. The Colonel fixed everything up and tomorrow Capt. Keys takes me out in a car. Later tonight I will try and see the Col. and ascertain if he approves of my plan for the models. If he does so I will send it off tonight and trust to luck. Many thanks for the photograph.<br/>Bois d'Escardonneuse<br/>France 12/7/18.<br/>Here I am out at a little camp where Capt. Keys brought me in a motor car this morning. A marvellous chauffeur brought us out - I've never seen his like - he was extravagant of everything but space when passing other vehicles, which he'd skim by the thickness of a coat of varnish. When we got near to our destination Keys got out to look for the camp, while I went on to the engineer workshops to seek my stretcher. When I got there I found that the stretcher had been finished but had also been condemned, and the new one wouldn't be finished till noon. I left word that I would send for it after lunch, got back to where I'd left Keys and found a man waiting to conduct me to the camp. Arrived there I met the two officers in charge of the camp, one of whom I'd met before.<br/>They gave me a right royal welcome and immediately made most considerate arrangements for my stay. I did a couple of sketches of two favorite horses which found favour and promised to do them later</p>
