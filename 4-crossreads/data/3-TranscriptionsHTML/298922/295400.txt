<p>Thursday 15 March 1917</p>
<p>Letter from Aunt Anna which is so interesting telling me all about old father's relatives. Did more Field work today. School closes tomorrow with EXAM. I have done well so far &amp; am getting 2 days leave after. Saw Cuth Fetherston Hough &amp; his wife. He should be getting his majority very soon now.</p>
<p>I am writing his Father today.</p>
