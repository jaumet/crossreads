Broadmeadow CampNewcastle1st November 1915.Dearest old Mrs,How do?  I arrived at Camp about 9 on Saturday night & found Captain Vickery the other Medical Officer down & apparently with measles.  I packed him off to Sydney yesterday and wired for another medical officer - I understand one is coming up to-morrow.  I sent you a wire this afternoon but suppose you'll not get it till to-morrow - I find that to-morrow (Tuesday) is the last day for getting one's name on the federal roll & that you are liable to be fined if it is not on so you had better bustle off to the local post office & have a look at the rolls and if our names are not on get them put on.I journeyed out to [indecipherable] this morning & had lunch with them - they had had a recent wire from Uncle Joe saying he was alright.Pretty comfortable here - cake a great success   Best love all at home, in haste.Yr Loving husband  Will
