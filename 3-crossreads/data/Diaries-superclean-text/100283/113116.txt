Mate of Fred Duke's, who was killed on his way over, my luck was out for they had only moved the previous day the 4th Div. having relieved them, however I know where they have shifted to, to-morrow I will dig him up 
6th. Sat up pretty late last night yarning with Freddy Turner a few A..C. chaps, the one great topic among us all old hands is this Australia leave when we will get it , who is entitled to it etc, old Drummie Downes Hellier are going tomorrow they say, so if they are going to maintain this rate which is 5 per month my turn will very soon be round about the end of April or beginning of May all going well.
