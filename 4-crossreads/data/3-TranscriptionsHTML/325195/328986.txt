<p>29.10.15<br/>Fri 29th<br/>Another warm day, apparently the cold weather during the last fortnight was only a cold snap &amp; not the commencement of winter; Yesterday the Signallers were reformed &amp;  Traill &amp; Leask were both made Corporals of A &amp;B Sqds respectively; Stan was unlucky in going sick so soon, as he would certainly have got one of the jobs; I heard to-day for the first time that Claude Lambert came over with the last lot of reinforcements &amp; is now in A Sqd. I had not heard before that he had even enlisted, a good many wounded men were sent away today apparently from the left so I guess all the troops are not having quite as easy a time of it as we are at present; The aeroplanes have not been so active as usual lately probably on account of the weather</p>
