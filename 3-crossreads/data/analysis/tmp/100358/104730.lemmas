 flock out and said all kind of thing we could not understand . The kiddi were funni too . Lot of small girl boy stood at the salut quit solemn , while the column pass . The soldier were dress in quit an art shade of grey , with bluish putti . The N.C. O 's and Officer are more adorn . The road are cobbl and march veri tire . My feet tingl throb after a few mile of it . Of cours we travel with all we own on our back , and 24 hour ration in our haversack . Boulogn has not impress us . The architectur is veri poor class inde , and thing seem dirti and now at all sanitari . But we did not see the best part of the citi . At midday on the 17th we entrain for Etapl , a coastal town about 25 mile north of Boulogn . The travel was slow and uncomfort . The 3rd class here is obvious onli meant for peasant passeng . The seat are uncov wood , and the floor steel . Oh ! how cold our feet got . This is not a particular interest trip . We were struck tho ? , with the number of British soldier seen all the way , busili engag with transport duti . England must have an enorm armi here now . We pass a larg foundri work and saw all the women work the truck and slag heap . They are veri merri bright . Their dress is rather uniqu . They have dungare black or brown larg baggi trouser , and a larg apron . Franc is in this war heart and soul all right , and we are surpris at the enthusiasm and cheer of the peopl after two year of it . But this cheer must not be misread . It spell determin , and in the villag of Etapl these same women may be seen on Sunday , go solemn to mass , dress in black . Franc has paid dear with her men . About 2 hour brought us to the station .
