  
 will, then there will be some real fun & plenty of souvenirs.  I hope you got the two bombs I gave Ken to send over to you.  I haven't heard from him since he left & dont know where he could have got to or how he is getting on.  I am glad you are taking a good holiday & hope you do not finish it before you get properly well & strong.  I am sure you will have a good time at Woodville.  I am expecting to hear from you there next mail.  Dont let Bruce enlist before he is 20 but I dont think there will be any war by then as the war will be over by then.  Give my love & kisses to all.
