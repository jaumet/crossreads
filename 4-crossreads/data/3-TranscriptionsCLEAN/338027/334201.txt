Sunday, 27 June, 1915The R.A.M.C came aboard at nine a.m. and commenced unloading patients, I was clerking & checking as they went off.  The Aust & N.Z. went to Cairo, the others, British etc to a hospital.  Here the officers are going into private hotels, the last patient went off at one oclock and we all heaved a sigh of relief we had finished a tremendous task and we felt we had done our duty, then a mail came on board from another boat on which H section are, they have been to Malta and back.  We were paid and most of us went ashore to try and forget the past few days.  I had a piece of singularly bad luck to day, I cabled home and put the receipt in my pocket later putting my hand in my pocket, pulled out a piece of paper thinking it the receipt and threw it away after to9 my chagrin I found that I had thrown away a bank note, then by a coincidence found a half piastre piece, to recompense me.
Monday, 28 June, 1915There was a big British & French advance yesterday.
Most of the men went ashore after we had cleaned up in the morning and put 800 paliasses & blankets, quilts etc.  since I can afford to throw money away I determined to stay home & have a sleep but about tea time I was hauled out to go ashore by my two mates from Ramleh.  I was pleased to see them, they are getting very tired of the camp out there especially under Capt. Nicholas whom they all bitterly dislike, I gave them nearly all my Aust shirts, socks, helmet etc as they have had nothing , whilst I have done well.  The Third Contingent arrived here a few weeks ago & went to Cairo, another is expected shortly I hope with my brothers in.  things are just the same at Anzac & Sidil Bahr [Sedd el Bahr].
