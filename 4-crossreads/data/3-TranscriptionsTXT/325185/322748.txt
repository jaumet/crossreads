 Dear Father. 
 I dare say you have been wondering why I havint written lately. I havint been abel to settle to it somehow. But here goes this time. I wrote and told you I was out of Hospital again am feeling O.K. again. The hand has quite healed &amp; can use it as well as ever. You can still see a little wastage but dare say that will come alright again in time. Just at presint I am on leave fourteen days we are given after coming from Hospital. Have to report again at the base at Weymouth then &amp; are sent to Camp to wait for a draught going back to France I don't know how long that will be but have asked to be sent back with the first lot going. We have to report a Weymouth when discharded from Hospital are examined by our own Drs there and marked fit or otherwise. You are always asked if you feel fit to return straight away or if you would like a little longer. I said was ready to go back straight away so was marked A I Class &amp; given my leave straight away. So here I am. I had a very good time whilst in Hospital also
