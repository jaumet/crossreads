they took no notice anyhow and darned nearly upset the boat.  The Nids sent some presents away.  In our route march we only seen the Native Quarter.  The roads are magnificent & beautifully clean.  We only seen three white women and about 4 black ones altogether here.  We are coaling here & there is a coating about an inch thick everywhere.  All the Native shops are open on Sunday the same as on week days.  The troops got a set of gloves & started the Nigs fighting, in the dark too.  The show was easily worth 2/6 admission.
