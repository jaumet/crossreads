 A bonza day quite a contrast to yesterday.  We had a muster parade at 2 p.m. but got no news on it of our movements but I fancy Monday or Tuesday should see something doing, &amp; won't we be glad for one gets sick of hanging about waiting for our time to come. 
 20th.  Went into Plymouth last night &amp; after a walk round the town went to the Theatre Royal an opera was on &amp; one that I had seen while in Paris "Rigoletto" I liked it in English much better than Italian, the 3rd &amp; 4th Acts I think are splendid.  I had a bonza seat &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was 10 oclock when it came out &amp; I missed the last tram &amp;amp had to walk all the way home. Sunday &amp; a most miserable day, a cold wind has been blowing all the time &amp; it looks like rain.  I wish to goodness they would get us across &amp; on to our boat, influenza is raging round here &amp; a lot of the boys are down with it one chap
