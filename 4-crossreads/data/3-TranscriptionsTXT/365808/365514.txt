I expect there is surface running water in the hilly country but this plain only carries the excess during the rainy season down to the sea. Strangely enough you can go down to a considerable depth here without getting water, as has been proved by our engineers &amp; yet on the beach &ndash; or a few hundred yards from it, you can get good fresh water a few feet from the surface. The men dig pot holes &amp; get beautiful drinking water &ndash; rather hard but tasting so well that it's a dence of a job to keep them from drinking it without chlorination. It certainly does seem a great pity to put the beastly taste of chlorine into such water but we dont know what it is draining through or how it may become contaminated. So we treat all water whatever source. I don't think any of it is very dangerous but I don't like the idea of drinking any water out of country inhabited by these Hittites or Amladites (the latter is right), as our Bedouin friends are said to be, without sterilising it I am going over at the first opportunity to look up Bill Edwards &ndash; a brother of George of that ilk, who is a Lieut.
