7th The battle raged fast and furious all night. Our boys were driveing the Turks from one ridge to another inflicting loss,s and in many cases makeing prisoners, we also had many casualties due to Turkish snipers being hidden in tree tops. The New Zealanders, Gurkhas, and several Battlns of Imperial troops reached our main objective "Hill 971" Chunak Bair and terrible fighting took place, further on our left our Brigade supported by the Wiltshire Regt and a Battln of the Kings Own Light Infantry were putting in good work, but arrived just to late to capture a Battery of enemy Guns which were splendidly concealed in an Olive grove, some of our Company were quite close and could hear the Turks shouting out orders and whipping their horses up, in their efforts to save their guns, they left many rounds of big Gun ammunition behind (The famous "Lonely Liz" was one of the guns lost.) We went well out scraping all the way untill meeting superior numbers when we dug in and held on.
We were greatly surprised when we saw Warships and Transports in Suvla Bay as we never heard they intended makeing another landing and what a "mess" it was, it being daylight when the movement commenced, with the result that the Turk Artillery played havoc among them as they advanced across open fields, we could see them falling in dozens. We held 3 wells for a time but had to leave.
