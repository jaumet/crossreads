<p>They were horribly knocked about. It looks as if we could walk right to Berlin, &amp; we still encountered no opposition. Then some Hun shelters, horse stable came on the scene, &amp; about 50 Fritzes put their hands up, &amp; hurried eagerly to the rear. Our chaps took anything worth having as souvenirs. We climbed another hill ,&amp; were nearly on our objective line, when we struck Hun machine guns in a sunken road, &amp; they poured a fire on to us &amp; made it lively. I saw 2 running away about 400 yards off, &amp; had the satisfaction of bringing one down as he ran. Our O.C. Capt. Geary (only made captain a few days ago) was shot dead, he was a fine old chap the boys all called him "John". Then a couple of tanks went down, &amp; a lot of Huns came running back with their hands up. Jerry Saxton was that wild he turned his Lewis gun on to some of them. They had just killed John Geary near him. Poor Ted Curley was killed too, no stretcher bearers handy to take him away, &amp; he bled to death. The 16th B'n now pushed on further ahead &amp; we dug ourselves in: He was putting shells over now, &amp; several were being hit. Lor' we were tired, &amp; at 3p.m. we actually had to move up to the front line another mile &amp; a half. As some of the Lewis gun section had been knocked, I had to lump a pannier full of ammunition as well as my other infernal load. That means we'll have no sleep tonight, &amp; we're dead beat now. When we got up we found the 16th B'n. had suffered heavy casualties. from machine guns &amp; shells. coming up, owing to the Tommies o n the flank having been held up. It is awful to see the dead, &amp; badly wounded lying about, wish the awful affair would soon end. I kept falling asleep as I stood looking</p>
