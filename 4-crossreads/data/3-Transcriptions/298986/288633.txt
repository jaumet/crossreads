<p>ships from Submarines to old wooden Battle ships 3 of them tied end to end with roofs on them for training ships.  Also a mother ship for planes.  Not many mercantile boats.  The harbour is quite small &amp; windes about a lot but must be deep for these big boats to come up.  It is quite a pretty place when you get away from the town.  Think we left Keyham Dock.  Can see a Lighthouse now on the Starboard</p>
