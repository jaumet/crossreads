Last night we passed through some fresh country, per Road early this morning I looked out of our , and could see fresh scenery, green forest country with dense under growth, it was very pretty, but I was tired and sleepy and was in too crowded and cramped a position, to take very much notice of the country we passed through, we detrained at a Rly Stn somewhere and after waiting for some time set out for our present destination, again the country had changed, and after leaving the Rly we marched along a road, shaded by tall trees. I fancy they were Elms, There were a few poplars by trees that had been lopped and only a bushy top left, the wheat crops here are not quite so fine as those we left behind us but the poppies grow all through this wheat here, they are very pretty, one wheat field was a picture, poppies, Red and blue Cornflowers, amongst them other wild flowers, place Puce and white were growing, the Road at one place ran round the side of a hill and gradually led down into the valley, on our left was the hillside with a few straggly patches of wheat, oats etc, and flowers growing through them on our right the valley stretches, patches of green crops, potatoes Beans wheat etc, and Through them scarlet patches of poppies, and away in the valley a small cluster of houses, amongst the trees, on the opposite slope more crops, and more flowers, it was a very pretty scene, the name of the place I cannot tell
