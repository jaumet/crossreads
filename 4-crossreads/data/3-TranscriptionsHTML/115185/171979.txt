<p>3 - working under me and three orderlies and an orderly in the majors consulting room.<br/>I have not had any letters from Gibson but I expect he has written to you the girls &amp; Isoult &ndash; of course I think he could not have a better wife than Isoult will make and I like her very much &ndash; and it is nice that she &amp; the girls are friends which may help Gibson a lot. Poor darling, I hope all will be well. I know you will have many fears and qualms about the future. I have not heard from J &amp; R. for some time. I hope grandmother is alright. I know how sad precious Mother this anxiety is for you &ndash; and the awful war and the worry having the girls so far away &ndash; and So many things to worry about the rest of your children. I love the long letters from Con. They are very interesting to me and so apart from war. Everything is veiled in mystery here</p>
