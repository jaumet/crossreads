 &amp; comfy chairs &amp; good lights, I simply long to be home again. Though I'm glad I was able to come out &amp; try to do my little bit. Than goodness I'm a nurse. All the comforts &amp; pleasures of home life I shall appreciate when I return. Time to stop &amp; am very tired, writing by candle light is very inconvenient. Hope you are all very well &amp; happy. To-morrow will be a sad day to us, poor old Dad, what a blessing he did not live to see this war. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. From,                                                                                                                                          Your loving daughter,                                                                                                                        Edith.        Have not received any letters yet. Am longing for some. Not a line from any of the boys. Hope they are safe &amp; well.
