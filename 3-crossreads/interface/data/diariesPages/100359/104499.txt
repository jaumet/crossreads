Friday 24th Xmas Eve.
Camp quite lively. Looking forward to a good time. Ordered supply of good things from canteen. Things very dear, Lucky to get in early as canteen almost run out of supplies. Went down after dark to get it. Falling over sand hills stones, and almost fell into canal. Convivial evening in No.8 tent. Last night our tent blew down 4 times, we fixed it up 3 times, but the 4th time we let it stay and slept in the open, with the sky for a roof. Commenced to write to Lill, but had to give it up as the mob were so noisy. Commenced to rain heavily but did not last long.
