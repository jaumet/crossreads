<p>Jan 29th  At Bazentin awaiting leave but still no news of its re opening<br/>Jan 30, 31, Feb 1st, 2nd  Still waiting.  Weather perfect but cold with clear sunny days &amp; moonlight nights.<br/>Feb 3rd  Tonight I visited Pozieres &amp; had a look over old ground.  A battery of 9.2's is where Jack [indecipherable]'s grave is &amp; things are as safe as houses.<br/>Feb 8th  Weather still very cold and frosty. Papers say that it is the coldest winter for a generation.  Fritz shelled about &frac14; mile from H.D. S to day.<br/>Feb 9th  Leave passes arrive  I move to J.H.Q. where I find out that Leave has been stopped again<br/>Feb 11th  Last night the 4th &amp; 5th Battalions had a raid which was an utter failure.  Our casualties out of 100 men were 50 wounded and 25 or about killed and missing.  Our H.D.S. is most inconvenient and our colonel most incapable.  He got most flustered and in no way can compare with our ex colonel.<br/>Feb 14th  Went for a walk to Edwards Post to show Perkins round.  A stunt is expected in a few days &amp; he is in charge of reserve squads.  Came home through High Wood where there are many monuments to the 1st Division which took place in most of the fighting there. There are 5 or 6 stranded tanks there &amp; they are being cleaned in anticipation of being used again.<br/>Feby 15th  Tonight we were warned that an aeroplane raid was to be attempted by Fritz on Rail heads.<br/>Febry 16th  This morning I was awakend by bursting bombs &amp; anti aircraft shells  Fritz caught a big ammunition dump this morning &amp; caused great explosions to happen all day.  The damage must have been great.<br/>Feby 24th  Everything lately has been quiet on the front &amp; the casualties have been slight.  The good weather has gone now &amp; it is now muddy again.  Considering the late frosty weather the weather now is warm</p>
