Motor ambulances, we never had to wait a single minute to get them away & I hope the people responsible get every credit.
Our advanced Dressing Station is alongside of where they bury the boys & its heartrending to see the dead waiting to be buried. All our Boys admit & recognize we owe a debt of gratitude to the Ox & Bucks also to a squad of New Zealand Field Ambulance men who gave a willing hand when we were all fagged & weary to get the boys in.
22/7/16  Saturday
Was on duty with 3 others in the trenches from 8 am till 10 pm but we got no relief & had to stay on till 6 am this morning, our relief couldn't get down to us owing to snipers & machine gun fire across the road & saps. killed 2 men & 3 horses alongside the dressing station - Put in a very cheerful night. I don't think). Dr Minty said I could go & have a good camp all day, so self & 3 others got into a dug out about a mile back & slept like a top till 8 pm. Very few casualties today - Some bearers went out on to no mans land & got 2 men still alive one with bullet in leg - the other shell shock. Pte Hamilton said he had been over & was coming back when they got him, he lay there since
