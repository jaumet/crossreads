<p>a 1/- a day 6d of which is sent home.  They envy us our 6/- per day.  The ship was towed to another berth this morning.  All the dirty blankets etc. are being taken ashore to a laundry.  The boat is sailing again in 2 days.  Went ashore in a tug and marched down the railway to a single carriage.  Saw the 'Colenso'  Wilson Liner in dock.  Our carriage was hitched to a long goods train carrying army waggons etc. and at 3 p.m. off we went.  We arrived at our destination 11 hrs. later.  Abbaseih is the name &amp; it is 2&frac12; miles from Cairo.  En route we saw camels, mud villages, Moslems praying at sunset</p>
