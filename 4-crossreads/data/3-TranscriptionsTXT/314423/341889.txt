I am making two flower vauses for Valentine.The enemy shelled one of our observation balloons this evening, but done no damage.Friday Feb. 22. 1918. 1299Cold & windy.This morning with others I was detailed to go to the Brigade to work. When we got there we found the job was to rebuild and repair a dugout that had fallen in. All the old sandbags had rotted away, and we had to fill up the earth into new bags. There were details from all the Transports in the Brigade Battalion.
