  
 1918 Tue. 23rd Apl. Another concert in evening.  Not such a good show as the last.   Asstd vaudeville followed by a pierrot-show.   (4 male & 4 "female")  A couple of the "Pierrettes" were quite chic, but the others - ! 
 Aubrey E. Raymond-Barker, (the name quite suits the owner) actually had the nerve to give a "baby" song attired as a pierrette!   He had neither voice nor looks, but he  had  effrontery. 
 Wed 24th. Through the farm country at the back of the lager this morning, through a now-deserted villa-farm with charmingly laid-out gardens.   The surrounding country is very sandy, though picturesque, & although some rye is grown the land is chiefly devoted to timber, principally pine. 
 A long road back from the farm to the lager is bordered with cherry trees, now in full blossom.
