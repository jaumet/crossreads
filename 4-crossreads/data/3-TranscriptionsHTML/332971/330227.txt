<p>Dear me I felt desperate &ndash; so approached Matron but the answer I got was what I had expected "No Sister She Said there is no getting out of it You <u>must</u> be done.  Then I ask for permission to see a medical man &ndash; to tomorrow am seeing Major Martin &amp;  hoping that he'll be kind &amp; let me off.  Poor Anne if you think she is mentally weary &ndash; you'll think right so that is why I am putting you off for another time.  I'm sure if it wasn't for the pleasure of working and doing for the boys &amp; that I may say is the biggest blessing we have we should all be rushing to do transport work to Australia.</p>
