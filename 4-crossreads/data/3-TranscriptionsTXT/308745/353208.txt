 [Letter on Bellevue Hotel, San Francisco notepaper, possibly from Brian Pockley's younger sister Helen, to him from a ship on west coast of USA] My dear Brian My pretty little brother You see you have another Lovely letter mister From your sweet young sister 
 I hope that you're all thriving And that you're not driving Your poor old self too hard (I was born a bard) 
 We are all well now, though Kindly don't ask how so Matters with poor Helen When the ship is sailin'. 
 We can't reach Vancouver Though she's a quick mover Until early on the 4th Much to poor Pockley's wrath. 
 She was a day late leaving Because these cracked coal-heaver [?] Rascals in Australia Made her plans a failure.
