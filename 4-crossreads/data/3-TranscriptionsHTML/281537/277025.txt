<p>14/9/15  Johnstons Jolly<br/>Very cold at stand to &ndash; in fact so chilly today that one must take to breeches again as it is too frigid for shorts and bare knees.  I had a bad cold and slept after stand to until 8.30.  Today is quite wintry after all the warm weather.  Very quiet in the line today.  Colonel Henry Bennett leaves us tonight some shelling going on so only the snipers and observers are out in the open &ndash; the others take cover.  One man killed; another had his arm blown off.  Two others injured.  Went up to a little observation post with telescope and had a good look at the Chessboard and could see Turks digging there.  Quinns post is an elaborate place all wirenetted overhead to keep out bombs.  After breakfast sat down and read "Bulletin".  Not a shot to be heard and one has to keep reminding oneself</p>
