<p>Dear Mrs F<br/>We are having an OK trip &amp; Alan &amp; I are OK. Am looking after Alan heaps. Although we have any amount of influence we are unable to get leave to go ashore in the evenings.<br/>Kindest regard to all,<br/>Sincerely Yrs<br/>R Thompson PS Please tell Dene I will write from Colombo<br/>RT</p>
<p>Brisbane Saturday 13th</p>
<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>I just heard that we are going direct to England. It is pretty correct I think too. That will be O.K. won't it? I do not know if you will get this, if the Censor sees it you won't, but I am relying on "INFLUENCE" again.</p>
<p>You had better address all letters to Vic Barracks &amp; they will forward them on to me. Are leaving here tonight for Colombo I think, so should have plenty of time to write during that time.</p>
<p>Must cease now to get this away. Much love to all<br/>Alan</p>
