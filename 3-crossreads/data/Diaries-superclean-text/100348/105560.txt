Was sunbathing on the sand dunes all the morning. Went and tried my rifle on the range. It is a little beauty and worth caring for. I was in great form too and did exellent shooting.
1st May.1916
Went on a swimming parade to "Paris Place". Rather an unusual season to be swimming in the English Channel. Was swimming round the wreck of the P.G. steamer Scotra. Which was mined or torpedoed by the "huns" and run ashore. Evidently another ship was torpeoded near here lately for thousands of oranges are strewn along the coast. They are quite fresh and good. The rise and fall of the tide is extraordinary in these shallow seas.
