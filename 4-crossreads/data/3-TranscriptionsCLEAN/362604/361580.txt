are lengthening out, it is pretty dark now.  I've a lot of tidying to do to-night.  When I have to write, my room is just tidy enough to pass the C.O.'s inspection.  Now to-night I'll be able to make everything spick & span.  We'll have fried steak & sausages for supper, with cocoa, Tea or Coffee & jam, Long-lick, Cake, Short-bread, Biscuits or Ham & chicken paste with bread & butter if we wish besides lots of other things.  Our cupboard is nearly always full of good things.
Now, Mum, Dad & George I must bustle off or I'll miss Tea & I've got to stay on Duty till 6 p.m. to-night.  Regards to all the Neighbours & poor Mrs. Doyle & remember me to Mrs. Stephen Dobson, Keirle & Bunting.
Best Love to you allFromDave, Ellis & Harry
