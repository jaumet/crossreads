March 191729th.   Only fifteen of the section arrived yesterday, (the remainder are at VayluleVelu about 4 miles Kilometres further on, and at MillerSon) & seven of us went on with Cpl Moore to clean & make ready for use old wells the advance party have found in Velu.   I stopped behind & fixed up the cellar, & also with a couple of sappers, hunted around the village, salvaging material for use by the section in our work.   The village is in a dilapidated state & every house is in a mass of ruins.   Every well has been destroyed & the fruit trees & many ornamental trees have been cut down by the Germans.During the afternoon the Flying Corps brought up an observation baloon which is to be stationed in a paddock opposite us.
