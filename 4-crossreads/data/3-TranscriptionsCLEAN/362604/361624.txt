Waves swept the deck & there was only room for 6 on the top deck, & Dave & I & a Yankee Lady made 3 of them.  Ellis went below but I was the only one sick.  I was only bad for 5 minutes, only one heave.  There weren't 10 people on the boat not sick.  We travelled on the old Fenella, a 500 ton packet & she had to have a new boiler put in in 1893, so she is pretty old but not a bad sea boat.  We missed our train our Train at L'pool at the boat took 71/2 hours & we had to stay in London over night.
