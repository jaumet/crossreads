<p>Monday April 30th<br/>There is plenty of recreation here, there are two lovely billiard tables, &amp; plenty of reading, including Australian literature &amp; books. The trees are all beginning to bud, &amp; it is marvellous how quickly they grow too. Put in for a late pass but got a knock back.</p>
<p>Tuesday May 1st<br/>English people seems to get very excited over the first call of the cuckoo, which they say is the sign of spring. A lovely day. Very quiet.</p>
<p>Wednesday May 2nd<br/>Went for a very nice walk. Was watching the means of getting barges through the canals &amp; locks, it was very interesting. As we are to go to Weymouth tomorrow we have to draw kit at 6 pm this afternoon.</p>
<p>Thursday May 3rd<br/>Fell in at 8.30 am &amp; caught a train to Paddington station London, where we caught an express train for Weymouth; &amp; my word it did travel too, at times I reckon we done 60 miles an hour easy. It was a beautiful trip &amp; everywhere along the line was lovely &amp; green. Upon arrival here, we were conveyed to Monte Video Camp by motors. We are in shacks here. It is a very big camp. This is the last camp for those embarking for Australia.</p>
