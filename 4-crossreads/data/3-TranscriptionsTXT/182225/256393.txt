OCTOBER   SUNDAY 1   1916
Fine & warm. We had no parade (church) in morning. Bill & Jack, Poss, Lawry & Armstrong & self went for a ride round the downs & tried some horses at the jumps & went round Figledean afterwards & saw the old "village chestnut tree" which Longfellow immortalised in his poem. In afternoon Poss & self went out to "Chiterne Farm" to see an old racehorse he used to have (Dalkieth). Mr & Mrs Long (manager of the farm) gave us tea & supper & brought us back in their car. They were jolly fine people & treated us A1.
