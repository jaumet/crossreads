<p>not send them through the censor.<br/>It is a shame to see all the cows &amp; pigs &amp; fowls walking about the fields &amp; shells falling about them. When we first came up on this front we could see plenty of them but now they are nearly all killed. I will not say any more about this unpleasant subject Dear but I thought it might interest you as the papers do not know much only what the corresponden[ts] write about &amp; they are not near enough to know what the war is like. They think they're at the war, so thats alright.<br/>Well Dearest I wonder if you are going to swim again next year! If you do please do not forget me or what you promised me will you? I love you Dearly you do not know how much &amp; it would break my heart to think you would do something or go anywhere that you know I would not like. Please remember me Violet Darling &amp; never mind what any one else says because I love you Dearly &amp; some day I want you to be my wife. I could never take to anyone else &amp; when I come home &amp; can get a very nice home for you  I am sure you will not be sorry for waiting all these long years &amp; months for me. Be true my Darling &amp; you have my word that I will be the same. Tell your Dear Mother that I am looking forward to her letter so not to keep me long. Give my love to your mother &amp; sister &amp; kind regards to your Father. When I have a chance of getting a photo taken I will &amp; send you home some.<br/>I must bid you "Au Revoir now violet Darling &amp; when I receive your next letter I'll write straight away. Fondest love &amp; kisses from your Affte Lover Alfred.<br/>19 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p>
