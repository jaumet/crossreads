<p>Tuesday, 20 October, 1914<br/>I awoke with a bad attack of neuralgia &amp; it made me feel very miserable.  The weather was beautiful &amp; the sea as calm as a mill pond.</p>
<p>We saw a lot of whales &amp; one spouted within a few yards of the ship.</p>
<p>I had up till this been sleeping on deck &amp; caught a nasty cold in consequence determined to go below.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 21 October, 1914</p>
<p>My cold got worse and stables in the morning was a dreary job to me.</p>
<p>We started to exercise horses, which has to be done in calm weather.  It is an awkward job &amp; a dangerous one.</p>
<p>I got kicked in the front of the thigh and was knocked against one of the rails.  The result was a bruised back.  I played poker at night &amp; lost but felt too bad to play on.</p>
<p>We were paid &pound;1 ships pay to day.</p>
