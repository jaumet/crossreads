<p>Saturday 18 May<br/>Absolutely glorious days, now hot.  We indulge in cold baths daily &amp; enjoy them.  I think this is about a record no stretcher cases since the 8th Battn. has been in. More fires in the vicinity to-day.  Moonlight now &amp; aerial activity day &amp; night is great.  In number of 'planes up, ours are greatly in the majority.  We are to be relieved soon, worse luck.</p>
<p>Sunday 19 May<br/>The 8th Battn. was relieved to-night after having done six days in the line with only one man wounded &amp; he walked out. Still glorious weather &amp; the country here is a blaze of colour, buttercups &amp; daisies. The Boche has been shelling round about here again, but nothing close.</p>
