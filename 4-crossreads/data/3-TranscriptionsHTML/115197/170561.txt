<p>Hobart and anchor in Barnes Bay.&nbsp; From<s>e</s> there all Tasmanians are taken to the &quot;quarantine station&quot; in a very small launch.&nbsp; The water is rather rough and great amusement is afforded us by the attempts of the &quot;Tassies&quot; to get from one boat to the other.&nbsp; Unfortunately (for them) it will be necessary to do 7 days in quarantine.</p>
