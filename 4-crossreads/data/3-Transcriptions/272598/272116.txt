<p>cobble stone roads.</p>
<p>Tuesday 17.10.16<br/>Preparing to move further on to-day.  Felt the cold during the night with only 1 blanket. Left Strazelle at 2 pm &amp; marched to Bailleul to entrain, about 9 kilos.<br/>After putting wagons on train, moved out about 6 pm. 40 of us to a horse box, quite a tangle when we tried to stretch out.</p>
<p>Wednesday 18.10.16<br/>Travelled all night. Disentrained at Longpre at 7.30 AM.  Unloaded wagons &amp; marched off at 9 AM.  Marched through L'Etoile &amp; on to Ergnies where we arrived &amp; billeted at 3.30 pm.  March very heavy owing to the rain &amp; the heavy roads.  As usual the shortage of rations did not tend to make the march any easier.  People here very ungrateful, even refusing to give a drop of hot</p>
