  
 17 May 1915 Monday 
 More big shells   &  a whole lot of shrapnel during the day but very few hit It is very droll to pick up a Sydney newspaper about a month old   &  read about the    it  Turks being short of men   &  munitions   &  then listen to the shells bursting about every five minutes 
 1915 May 18 Tuesday 
 More sapping   &  repairing Head - Quarters which has been damaged by the 8.5 in shells. The dad not at all well.
