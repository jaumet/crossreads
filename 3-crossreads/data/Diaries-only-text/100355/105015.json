A drink of coffee we reported to Corp Hq. to see whether it would be possible to get a conveyance through to Chaleroi on the following dat. Nothing was going until the 27th so we returned to our billet. Just as we were entering we were met by the Cure who informed me that an Australian soldier an a civilian were dying by the canal, having been blown up by a bomb. We spent the rest of the day searching for them, but at dusk finding nothing we returned. I went to the town clerk told him that we could find nothing discovered that the Commisiare had found taken them to the next village.
Catillon was enfete at night
