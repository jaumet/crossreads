Turned out in the rain &amp; muck with these infernally heavy packs on, &amp; there was the usual army arrangements &ndash; no one to tell us what to do or where to go. The chaps swore &amp; counted the army out &amp; roared out &quot;What are we here for?&quot; We stood or leaned about as best we could; knowing what the Army is, I took things easy, leaned my heavy pack against a cart &amp; rested the best I could.
