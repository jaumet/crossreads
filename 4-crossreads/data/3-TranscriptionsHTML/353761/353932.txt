<p>Reveille sounds at about half past two in the weird sleep-bound moments of the early day.<br/>We are up before dawn while yet the silver night lingers and holds the world in its romantic darkness, which is not of gloom.<br/>Candles glimmer in the cook-houses, and we are soon at an early breakfast in the low huts which have been our quarters for a time.<br/>There in dim candlelight the troops are rapidly through with the hot tea, bread and butter, and bully beef which constitutes the meal; and then there is a scene of almost confusion as men are moving with their shifting shadows whilst packing their haversacks and adjusting their equipment.</p>
