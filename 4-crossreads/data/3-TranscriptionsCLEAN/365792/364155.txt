18  No time to answer any letters as we leave today probably for France. We were awakened about 4 am by "W" banging a tin with a huge stick, but it took several more calls & much noise to get us out, & even then a few of us turned in after the tent had been folded. Windy as the devil, & the fine sand stings no end & fills up a fellows ears until he begins to imagine he's a dredge or a sand dump. Several troopships went through yesty enroute to the Great Bitter Lakes, where we are to embark. Hope those Submarines take a tumble & dont shoot out of their turn. Left at 8.50 am arrived Tad Seon at 10.40 left at 12.50, & arrived Serapeum at 2.30 - distance about 7 miles over the desert & blowing like H---- all the time
19  Rained heavily during the night, & this morning is beautifully cool. Church Parade as usual. Met Taffy Powell & other chaps of the 6/2 Prince of Wales lobbed along about [in margin] Sunday
