 [Tuesday 25 July 1916] 
 Out again   Usual Taubes &amp; sniping   We leave one Officer &amp; 3 men to watch Turks all night when we ride home.  It's a weird job I did think the war would be getting over by this, but the end is not in sight. Our Officer's Patrol watching the Turks all night played hide &amp; seek with an enemy patrol but shooting in the dark is only wasting ammunition.
