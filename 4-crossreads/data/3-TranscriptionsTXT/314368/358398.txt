Well, what a beautiful big fellow he is with his lovely curly hair. The wound in his foot is perfectly well & he did quite a lot of walking while he was here and his leg did not seem to get tired at all & he walks quite as well as before he tells me, and is not a bit lame. He is a dear boy and used to talk about you all so often, and of the fun he used to have camping out.  I used to try to find out what he liked best to eat and at last after a great deal of questioning discovered his favourite pudding, he said mother would soon guess what that is, plum pudding  cold with milk & sugar.
I was so glad my niece Nora Cust was here for a few days holiday, she is busy ploughing
and doing farm work, they were able to go out together & they both enjoyed it, I do think our dear Australian boys miss the companionship of nice girls and there are so few opportunities for them to meet any just now, as every girl is busy at some war work.  I was born in Australia near Ballarat, Victoria, and as I am not strong enough to take up any definite war work, I try as far as possible to look after Australian boys, they do seem to love so to get into a house[?] for a little while. Gordon has written several times from camp, he is splendid about going back to a soldiers life again, how wonderful our boys, and all our men are.   Dr. Gazdar told me about Gordon, a young cousin of mine who was wounded was under her, I think she is wonderful & such a good woman, so I asked her if she knew of any lovely Australians to be sure to let me know, so I have her to thank for sending your dear boy to us. Peggy & I miss him very much. I trust this horrible war will soon be over  & that it may not be long before you have Gordon home again. With best wishesYour sincere friendAlice E.Purey-Cust
