<p>Dad,  but I would like to be able to give you some idea of how we are progressing. I think I shall be going on leave to England, shortly.  I cabled home for some money a few weeks ago, and as soon as it comes along I will be right. I had a long letter from Mr Staines some weeks back, he wrote from some place on the South Coast , and I sent him a long letter in return. I am writing this letter from inside an old German pill box , these pill boxes are really large cemented dugouts, and are fine shelters from shell fire, and they make great shelters for us as well as Fritz.  He must have spent a good deal of money in building these places, as most of them are very thick walled, and fitted up with electric lights. Of course the electric lights are not here now, our artillery saw to that in the battle of Messines, when these particular pill boxes were taken.</p>
<p>I'll have to sign off now for this time dad, sincerely hoping everyone are well<br/>With best and fondest love,<br/>Your loving Son,<br/>Gordon</p>
