whole thing was successful so far, many prisoners being sent back. Of course it will look very nice in the papers. "gallant advance by Australians." but the people who write it, & delight in reading it, don't know the horror of it all. The thing that was grand to see was the way our chaps bandaged wounded Huns, & carried them back to the dressing station, with just the same care as our own men, & Australians, Yanks & Fritzes lay side by side on stretchers. Some of the Yanks soon went under in their first battle, they only arrived in France a little while ago too. When I got back to our company's trench, I was just about to jump in, when a shell burst right in front of me, I don't know how it missed me. He sent more over all round our not-too-secure trench, & we & the Yanks were huddled up in the bottom like chickens, &  didn't know which way to turn to get away from them. It's an awful feeling, so helpless, under shell fire. It's a fine day, & our 'planes are up in crowds trying to detect the Boche's next move. I was mighty hungry, & had a feed of bread, butter & jam at noon., which while Fritz's shells were dropping uncomfortably near. He shelled both front & rear. & there was a slight sniff of gas, which made us sneeze. Old Mitchell
