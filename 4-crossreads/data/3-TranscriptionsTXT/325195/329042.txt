16.12.15Thurs 16th3 Hospital boats came in close to shore today which looks rather promising to us; A machine gun "posse" only large enough to hold a gun & 2 men has been dug on Russells Top to cover our retreat each gunner has been issued with a stick of gelignite to blow up their guns with; Barbed wire entanglements & trip wires are out everywhere & everything is as complicated as we can possibly make them for Johnny Turk when he comes along  It is also rumoured that 400 tons of explosives is under Walkers Ridges in mines a light pier has been erected out to the boat that is aground near Watson's Pier; If it comes to a fight & we can manage to get inside the old ship we shall be able to give a pretty fair account of ourselves  No N S Wales troops have been withdrawn yet apparently they are giving us New South Welchmen the honor of fighting a rear guard action
