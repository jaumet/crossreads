Dear Dad, Mum & George,
Here is Sunday once again & I've just finished all my work.  I generally let all the boys off on Sunday & then I can write letters in my office in comfort.  There have been lots & lots of changes lately & my staff consists of 3 only instead of over 60.  There is a Sergeant or N.C.O. responsible
