1916   MONDAY 24   JULY
Fine but dull. We got away from camp about 8.45 & marched to Amesbury & got a special train for Warterloo. We got there about 12.30 & marched to the Australian Military Offices in Horseferry Road. After fooling about there for a bit we were dismissed and I got a taxi & came straight to the Goring Hotel  Mother was waiting for me & it was good to see her again. Alan came in later in his uniform. Both look very well  We went round the town a bit & saw Jack Bridges & Uncle Bertie (who is to be married tomorrow) Auntie Florence, Mrs Angus, Miss Robertson Mother Alan & I went to see Mr Manhattan at Prince of Wales Theatre. It was not much good. Had supper at the Savoy after & went down into the dancing hall after.
