<p>by Fritz. Then I heard poor little Jimmy Stewart was killed &ndash; our chaps were firing grenades trying to knock his guns out, &amp;amp good old Jack Gosper while firing a rifle grenade was hit in the head by a bullet from the German machinegun, &mp; his skull split open, so that another good corporal was killed. Ted Hugget  came into the sap to tell me, &amp; the next thing was that he too, while standing above the trench to fire a grenade was killed. Isn't it awful &ndash; then a bit came our way, as Lt. Player got a grenade on to one of his machine guns, &amp; knocked it out, &amp; went through it in. Two Fritzes were dead near it, &amp; one nearly dead. My mate &amp; I were almost too tired to stand up &amp; look over the top, &amp; it was a relief when daylight came at last, &amp; the night was over.<br/>Rations were issued amongst them a little tinned fruit from the comfort fund. We did day watch, an hour each in turn, &amp; lay down in the bottom of the trench &amp; had a sleep. Thank Goodness the weather holds good &ndash; if it rained we'd be in a bad way with no coats. Our artillery was shaking his locality up today &amp; planes of both sides were up. I was put on listening post tonight with 3 men, &amp; it was hardly an enjoyable job. Our post was on the edge of a road, &amp; opposite it a Fritz sap ran up to the road &amp; we were gazing across &amp; had to look on either side in the long grass. We could hear a big crowd of Germans talking, &amp; the clang of tools, evidently a wiring party. A" flare king" fired a flare &amp; I could hear a Hun whistle &amp; another one whistle in reply. We fired some rifle grenades into the direction of the sounds, Thank Goodness he didn't rush up the</p>
