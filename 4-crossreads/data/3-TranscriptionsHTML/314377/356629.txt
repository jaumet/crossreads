<p>quite nice when after a while I was able to sit up and write</p>
<p>It is wonderful when one is sick how little things are magnified into happenings of great importance For instance I used to think how nice it would be to sit at the table and write or wouldn't it be interesting to be able to get up and have a look at the landscape from the window opposite.</p>
<p>When I got stronger I started in different kinds of work Bead making Teneriffe wheel work and embroidery.</p>
