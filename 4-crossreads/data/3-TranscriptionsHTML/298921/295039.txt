<p>March, 1915<br/>Sunday 7<br/>Church parade, very sleepy &ndash; Went Zoo in afternoon. Have been warned to take <u>thick clothing</u> when we leave here in 10 days, but no one yet knows where we go, they manage these things well at Head Quarters, <u>not even</u> the wives know.<br/>Tried to be interested in Giraffes, etc etc, but got back to Camp early and had a glorious sleep. War Office advises I can wear both ribbons, I have been trying for this for some time, as the <u>bars</u> were issued years ago.</p>
