<p>very hot &amp; took my coat off, &amp; carried on I was getting on fine when one of the men in charge of the floor came across &amp; told me I had to put my coat on it appears it is against the rules to take your coat off &amp; I knew nothing about it however it made no difference I shoved it on &amp; continued skating, there are plenty of girls down here &amp; we had a fine time with them</p>
<p>I'll bet their arms are stiff this morning with dragging me round &amp; holding me off the floor where I used to have violent struggles trying not to sit on its greasy surface, a fellow feels as helpless as a kid once he's pushed out on to the floor &amp; he gets carried wherever his skates care to run, that is except when he isn't throwing his legs in the air like a bucking horse &amp; coming down with a thud &amp; a silly grin on his face.</p>
