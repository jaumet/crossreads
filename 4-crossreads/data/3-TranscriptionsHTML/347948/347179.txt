<p>The Jealous Lover</p>
<p>I would take your little throat in my hands<br/>Slight to snap as a flower stem<br/>But I could not kill the light in your eyes<br/>It would still be found in the morning skies<br/>A valley pool or a turquoise gem</p>
<p>I could hush your voice with my finger's press<br/>Leave you a broken silent thing<br/>But the lilt of the bird in the green scrub heart<br/>The sough of the wind and your tones would start<br/>And your words in the soft rain sing</p>
<p>I could tear you out of my soul to day<br/>Learn to hate &amp; curse you too<br/>Give my heart to the surgeon's knife<br/>But what were the use of a shattered life<br/>Bleeding to death for need of you</p>
