19/10/15
consider it the most glorious month of the year, the sunsets being especially fine In the last days of November or the first days of December another period is entered upon. There is generally a heavy south wind lasting from three to seven days, which is succeeded by a lovely spell of fine weather, generally perfectly calm warm, which brings one well through December. Onward from such time in December, say a little before Christmas or just after, the weather varies greatly. 
The marked periods are past - the weather may be anything, sometimes calm and mild, varied by rain, with strong north winds, but no seriously bad weather, in one word, no real winter weather need be looked for until, as the natives put it, the Old New Year ? otherwise the New Year, Old Style, which is January 14, our style ? comes in.
After January 14, or a few days later, the weather is almost invariably bad; there is always a snow blizzard or two, generally between January 20 25. These are real bad blizzards, which sometimes last from three to seven days; and after, anything in the way of weather may happen for the next six weeks or two months. The snow has been known to lie six weeks. Strong southerly gales succeed as a rule, the northerly gales, but one thing is to be noted that the south west winds no longer bring rain, it is to those who have relations or friends in the Dardanelles let them send good warm stockings c. It is the Turks who will suffer from the cold, they cannot stand it long, and being fed generally mainly on bread they have no stamina to meet cold weather. Most of their troops come from warm climes ?
