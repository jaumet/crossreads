<p>French I was able to make use of. Everything is French &ndash; no variety of tongues that one finds in Egypt.<br/>Wednes 5" April:-<br/>Left the "Braemar Castle" this morning to go into camp with the Unit in the grounds of the Ch&acirc;teau de Mousset. Went by motor ambulance &amp; what a drive! First through the busy docks bustling with war activity &ndash; then through the city with its cobbled streets, &amp; out into the suburbs beyond driving along fine long roads flanked with tall trees &amp; pretty detached houses with green covered hills rising in the background. And then along a narrow road by the seashore until we turned inland &ndash; the <strike>country</strike> rural aspect now became evident the car passing along narrow lanes</p>
