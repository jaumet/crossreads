<p>some Greeks who had  two baskets of oranges &amp; confiscated quite half of them.  It all happened in a minute; Greeks baskets &amp; oranges were upside down, then a moment later all was quiet &amp; the Greek was dusting himself down &amp; no doubt swearing his hardest.  Attended church at night &amp; had a good sing song of hymns.  Gambling is very rife at present, two-up schools etc running strong bets of &pound;10 &pound;20 &pound;30 &amp; upwards being common.</p>
<p>Monday 20th</p>
<p>Tried to get a boat in order to see the No. 1 A.S.H. crowd but could not manage it so spent the afternoon on the Pier yarning.  I had a letter to deliver to their O.C. concerning my transfer.  It read thus &ndash; I am loathe to 'lose Pte Gissing unless 'tis very necessary so that until you are able to promote him to Staff Sergeant at once I cannot agree to a transfer being made.  The letter was posted as I could not deliver it.  Turned in early but was disturbed somewhat owning to several tent mates getting drunk &amp; making things disagreeable.</p>
