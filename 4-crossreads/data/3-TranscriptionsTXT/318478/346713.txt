 Dear Mick 
 Again rain and added a cutting wind suggestive of snow.  Dodging the showers I rode to Anzac beach and did a topographical pencil drawing of a likely background for a landing picture.  The wind tried to tear the paper out of the book and my hands  wh  were nearly "fruz" so * "Bokra fil mich miche" as usual.  In the afternoon I mounted a new horse lent by the Division at Chanak, a good Irish hunter &amp; rode over to Hughes' camp &amp; back at a hard gallop up &amp; down hill &amp; across obstacles;  this ride restored interest in life and I  believe  the horse enjoyed it, though I  hate the human  presumption that fastens thought to dumb animals.  Late afternoon I did a water colour of the first of a series of bushes &amp; plants which I think should be recorded, a study of "Arbutas", that I believe is the name, rather a wax like leaf with a sort of blossom something like a laurel but with red  res  stalks or sticks. 
 You are about due for your first separation allowance and [Drawing] * (Tomorrow when the apricots appear!)
