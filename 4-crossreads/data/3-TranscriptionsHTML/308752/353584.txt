<p>The show as a splendid one &amp; the theatre was packed. My room at the hotel was a very comfortable one, nothing like having the very best after living under the ground over in France.</p>
<p>Monday the 19th. inst was a very busy day for me, I did a number of important commissions for some of my pals over yonder, purchased a number of gifts which I sent home, &amp; called on Mr Hooper, of Hooper &amp; Harrison.   I spent an hour at his office, &amp; we had a good old yarn.  In the afternoon I do some more shopping, as the bus strike was on, I often travelled by the Tube Railway.  This unfortunately was bad for me, as I got lost travelling about in this manner so had to have a taxi. During the afternoon I called on a friend of one of the chaps in the Ambulance, &amp; we had tea together, &amp; then went to Chu Chin Chow in the evening. I liked this wonderful play, better than last year, the music in it is beautiful, &amp; the staging magnificent. This play has had a wonderful run, over two years.  Oscar Asche &amp; Lilly Brayton, take the leading roles in it. The score of Chu Chin Chow was sent home, that famous Cobblers Song is included in it.</p>
<p>One would never think, on seeing London, that there was a War on, the whole place is one wild rush &amp; excitement.  Jolly good thing to see the place like this, a sure sign that we are winning.</p>
