<p>good time.  On the morning of the 25th (Anzac Day) I witnessed the march of the Aussies from the base of Queen Victoria's Memorial in front of Buckingham palace.  After dinner I took train back to Sutton-Veney Camp.</p>
<p>27-4, Sunday<br/>Perishing cold here.  There is nothing to break the wind and it absolutely freezes one's Blood.  38 Quota came in today.</p>
<p>28-4, Monday<br/>Very cold.  Heavy snowstorm during the night.</p>
<p>29th-4<br/>Issued with equipment for the march through London on the 3 prox.</p>
<p>2-5-19<br/>On the 30th we had a heavy day standing about in Battle Order while Officers gave us contradictory orders.  We were ordered to tie our Putties at the Bottom and today we were ordered to tie them at the top.  We were walked through all the mud lying about the camps today for absolutely no reason at all &amp; kept standing in the rain also.  No wonder it took us so long to starve Fritz.  The only way in which we <u>could</u> beat him with British Leaders.  I speculated in an Onoto Pen today.  We had a parade this afternoon which I dodged and on top of that another after tea, which I also dodged.  So far there is no information forthcoming about time of departure, leave allowance or time of return.  My present ambition is to get out of this Parade toute-de-suite.</p>
