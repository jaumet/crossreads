Monte Video Camp. Weymouth.  6.9.16
My Dear Mother
I have been out on furlough for a fortnight, and returned on the 4th to this camp. it is a bleak and dreary sort of place and just at present it is not at its best, light scuds of wind driven rain, and the wind blowing half a gale nearly all the time There is plenty of mud about you can just imagine what it is like. I believe we move next week to Salisbury, then I suppose it will be France later on. whether we go there in the winter or not I cant say but I would not be surprised. I am just about sick and tired, "not of the war" but of the men at the head of affairs, and a lot of the cold footed swine that are over here in fat jobs and who will take their share of praise for what has been done when they get back. some of them have been here over 12 months and there is nothing wrong with them, and never was much at any time except that their feet were cold, Well if they get the praise when they get home, they are gaining the contempt
