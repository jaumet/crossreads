<p>Bulford,<br/>20th January 1917.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Richards,</p>
<p>It's quite beyond me to write and express how sorry I am about Roy.  He was my chum and it's something I always will be really proud of.</p>
<p>He had a duty to do and he did it as a gentleman, and I've thought how great it must have been for him to hear "Well done", because it was well done and he did hear.  He is a great loss to you, only you know how great, but it must be great to have been the Mother of one who has given all he could so nobly.</p>
<p>I only saw the news in the "British Australasian" two days ago and yesterday heard direct from Mother.</p>
<p>I send you all my deepest sympathy.</p>
<p>With love,<br/>(Sgd) Charlie Witney</p>
