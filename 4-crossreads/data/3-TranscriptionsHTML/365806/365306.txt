<p>[Letterhead of Louise, Milliner &ndash; 374 George Street, Sydney]<br/>2.11.16<br/>To Mr. Justice Ferguson<br/>"Wimbledon"<br/>Potts Point.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I enclose an extract from a letter written to me, by a boy friend.</p>
<p>I know that you have received <strike>so</strike> so many testimonies to your son's nobility of character &ndash; still I thought you would like to have this expression of another boy's admiration for him.  It may help you to feel that you are not alone in your sorrow, his men mourn with you.</p>
<p>I am<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>S. Louise McIntyre.</p>
