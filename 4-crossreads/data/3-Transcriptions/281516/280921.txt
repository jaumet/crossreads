<p><u>Lille Post</u></p>
<p>11/6/16</p>
<p>Stood to arms in heavy rain at about 2.15 am, at which hour the first glimmerings of dawn had put in their appearance. Carried on at 3.15 &ndash; it was then broad daylight. Went to bed again and slept in until 9. All the men very tired and did not turn at till midday.</p>
<p>This dugout is most elaborate being built up against a wall of brick. There is a fireplace mantel shelf mirror, vases full of flowers a carpet on the floor and two easy chairs and a bunk. In this country one gets much more comfortable than in Anzac. Poked around all day mostly cleaning up as the place was very dirty.</p>
<p>A very quite day, thundery. Have been in a snappy temper ever since last night. Our raiding party has been told off and starts practice soon under Eliniger, Mackay goes from "C" Coy. The trenches connecting up these posts are a mass of lovely green and are often behind hedges. By No. 12 there is a little creek all fringed with stunted willows and the water well covered. A very pretty little place.</p>
<p>In this company there is now a family spirit among the men. They look after each other and are nearly all quiet steady going chaps. We don't realise how well trained we are. Fatigues and duties always turn out on time, whatever late hour they are detailed at. The NCO's do everything the officers merely giving their orders and walking out at the appointed time &amp; finding all ready for them to carry on. Ever since Anzac have been troubled with the itch and my crutch at present is nearly raw with irritation.</p>
