 1915 Oct. 18 Mon. 5 Orderlies going with some patients to Suez to-morrow &amp; returning the following day. Thinking that Suez air might be a change after that of Cairo I managed to get my name down as one of the 5 to leave first thing next morning. Suffered an extremely unpleasant shock when I found later in the evening (at the eleventh Hour, as it were) that my name had been taken off &amp; another chap put on by the O.C. &ndash; Finish Suez trip &ndash; Better luck next time.
