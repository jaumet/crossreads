<p>16th 1.16<br/>Had the most interesting &amp; enjoyable day I have had ever since I have been in Egypt.<br/>I got a Motor to Cairo Station from Heliopolis (together with 2 other Sgts) &amp; caught the Sassafra Mail to Bedrasheen.  On the way we passed through Embabeh, which is on the Nile &amp; famous for its Battleground where Napoleon met &amp; defeated the Egyptians.  The next stop was Boulac- Dacrour, which is the stop for the Avenue or drive to the Pyramids. (Guizeh or Giza) nearest Station to the Giza Group of Pyramids &amp; of which Cheops is the largest in Egypt.  Babylon lies on the other side of the River to Giza &amp; is famous for its old Roman Forts.</p>
<p>The next was Abon-El- Noumros [Nomrous] then Tammooh, from which Mahdi can be seen &amp; where the Turkish prisoners are kept then we came to Hawaineia a large Sugar refining district &amp; finally Bedrasheen our destination.  We next hired donkeys for the day &amp; started on our ride for the Sakkarah [Saqqarah] Desert.  The first place of interest is the ancient City of Memphis, then comes the Colossal</p>
