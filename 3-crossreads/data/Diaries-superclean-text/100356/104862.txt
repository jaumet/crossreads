The different units started to move out at day-break trains were leaving every hour we got all our stuff down about 2 pm when I returned to the camp it was to find the Canteen in flames, some of the boys had set it on fire as return for the high prices the proprietor had charged them, our boys were there of course didn't they get in amongst his stuff not half they only got 6 doz of his beer without other articles.
We started to load at 7 by nine the train was ready to move out, she passed the clock at 9.2 for our trip of 600 miles, the trip went OK till midnight for we had heaps to eat plenty of melons. We hadn't gone far when one of H Qrs horses got his leg over the rope of another cut his leg pretty severely. Turned in with Norm at 11 oclock on the train platform.
