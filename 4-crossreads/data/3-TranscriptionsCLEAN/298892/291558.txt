piano. The dining room is at the far end of this room and the bedrooms are in an adjoining part of the building. The charges are exceedingly moderate, 1s./6d. for a room and breakfast. The other meals we have wherever we happen to be at meal time. Meals can be had at the Hut, though, at any time of the day or night. The whole concern is run wholly for the comfort of the men and it is managed and worked by people who give their services gratuitously. This particular place seems to be run by the Smart Set. Society ladies and girls wait on the tables and do all the cooking. The main thing too is that everyone is exceedingly kind and makes you feel thoroughly at home. This is by no means their only building in London, the Y.M.C.A. have numbers of others scattered over London, but this is the newest and also the smallest. It can accomodate about 100 men. Only soldiers and sailors are admitted. Men in the trenches in France get 6 days leave every month and I have met several here who have just returned, many of them Canadians and a few Australians.
