 Wednesday 28 February 1917 
 Did an Out Post time for a change &amp; spent an evening with an old Scotch family I know at Zeitoun, had a time on Piano etc. Quite civilized &ndash; Lectures 2 per diem keeps me writing steadily &amp; a RECONNAISSANCE tomorrow on approved EUROPEAN lines. We are getting this training to put us alongside English Cavalry if necessary. 
 Went Cairo for Lunch at Continental. We get 3 hours 1 in middle of the day - &amp; Saturday afternoon &amp; Sundays off.
