3/12/18 Nice
Bedroom flooded with bright warm sunlight though the day is inclined to be hazy. Went out on to the Promenade des Anglais and read the "Petit Nicois" sitting basking in the sun. Took a walk down to the station and located the APM. After lunch went out on the Prom. again and had a long talk with a little girl who turned out to be a Pole but educated in France. Her father was taking his apperitif and we had a long yarn. Very convenable & proper she did not hesitate to discuss the stupides. Dined at Ruhl et Anglais and had a long yarn with a Lieutenant of Artillery from New York City. The view from the prom is very fine – one horn of the Bay des Angles is [indecipherable] Hill and the other is Californie. Very beautiful English uniforms a rarety here. [indecipherable].
