<p>[Letterhead of the "Grand Continental Hotel &ndash; The George Nungovich Egyptian Hotels Co.]<br/>Cairo, 16th February 1915.<br/>Dearest old Mrs,<br/>I have been staying for the last few days at this hotel in Cairo &ndash; I was feeling a bit run down out at the Camp &amp; got the Colonel's permission to have a few days loaf in Cairo.   I have been working pretty hard since we arrived at Mena &amp; have had a lot of responsibility &amp; I think it got on my nerves a bit &ndash; however I feel quite right again now and when I get back to the Camp I am going to take things a good bit easier.</p>
