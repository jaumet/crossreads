 1915 May. 26 Wed. Not much doing earlier part of day so wrote several letters to Sydney. In afternoon received telephone message to be ready for patients to be transferred from No. 15 General Hospital, Alexandria &amp; about 6 p.m. 146 arrived in motor ambulances &amp; were admitted pretty quickly but smoothly. In the evening went for a stroll with Snow Freeman &ndash; How fine the old Nile looks in the moonlight. Although hot in the daytime a cool breeze springs up at night. Really must learn as much Arabic &amp; French as possible &ndash; they are so useful.
