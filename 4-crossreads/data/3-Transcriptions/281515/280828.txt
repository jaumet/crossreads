<p>when I got better I was put in another Red Cross Train &amp; taken on to Havre to the Convalescent Camp there &amp; after two months there, was sent to the Infantry Base depot at Havre &amp; being examined by the Doctors was classed as B3 &amp; was sent to England   Weymouth was the place &amp; from there after waiting three weeks, went by train to Devonport where we got on Board the Medic for Australia.</p>
<p>We left there in a big convoy 12 large ships &amp; 1 cruiser 5 English destroyers &amp; one Yankee Destroyer also an Air ship which kept with us for the whole day &amp; then went back.  All ships were in darkness at night, no smoking on deck at night, &amp; no lights to be shown,   We kept together in three lines, the destroyers cutting in &amp; out all the time &amp; the Yankee keeping guard in the rear, all ships were continually changing position first we would be in front then another ship would go ahead &amp; zig-zagging all the time.</p>
<p>We never sighted any submarines on our trip &amp; after a few days when we were out of the danger Zone we separated &amp; the ships went their different ways &amp; when we arrived at Colon at the mouth of the Panama Canal we found one of the ships there before us &amp; all the destroyers except the Yankee ship had left us.  so we coaled ship &amp; next day we started to go through the canal which is a wonderful piece of work &amp; very interesting.</p>
<p>The ship goes into a lock &amp; is then raised by water coming into the lock &amp; when the ship is at the same height as the water outside  the gates open &amp; the ship is towed along by powerful land tugs</p>
