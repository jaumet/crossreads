<p>Thursday, 20 May, 1915<br/>Had a well earned sleep during the morning, more wounded came aboard, we now have all the patients wounds dressed and the work is now to feed and attend them.  The arrangements are very poor as everything came with a rush and our officers being doctors of course could not found a system so we have to go on working day and night until they do. More died today and were taken out to sea to be buried, four in all.  Every man is in sympathy with ambulance man Simpson who has been bringing wounded down the hill to the beach night &amp; day since the fight started, he used a little black donkey and he was under fire all the time.<br/>His boast was that he could not be hit, his escapes were miraculous but at last he was shot dead through the head.  He has been mentioned in dispatches.  The fight still rages on the hills at night.  The Turks have been reinforced and are doing the attacking, and are being mown down like sheaves.  The Austs are holding the position wonderfully, some of the Royal Marines the pick of the British Army were sent up to relieve them.  looking at the pos. they refused to take it saying they could never hold it but our boys did and are doing still although badly in need of a spell out of the trenches.<br/>[Simpson was killed on 19 May]<br/>Friday, 21 May.<br/>The 13 of our chaps that were transferred to the 3rd Fld Ambulance left to go in to the Luxor another hospital to-day they are not as well off as us.  Left to-day back to Imbros stayed there all day, three more deaths.  There was a glorious battle on the right of the hill about nine p.m. last night, the flashes of shrapnel Artillery and the British howitzers illuminated the sky occasionally the Man of War Bacchanty spoke and with effect.  Three of the deadliest Turkish batteries were silent.  The whole trouble so far with us has been espionage.  Four light horse interpreters who joined at Heliopolis proved to be spies they were caught signaling to the Turks and were promptly shot.</p>
<p>A splendid report was brought to us by a man of war man to-day, he said that the whole of the Turkish flank had surrendered led by a German Major General, if this is right it is a great move for us.  this flank is on our left and is held by the 1st L.H. Brigade and the N.Z.  The Light Horse are proving themselves every bit as good as the infantry while their machine guns are superior.  In the trenches it is quite safe and the wounded say we are in more danger out here than they are in their dugouts.</p>
