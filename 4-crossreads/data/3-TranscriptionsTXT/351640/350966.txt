 31.8.15.   9 a.m. Rather good news from Galipoli during the night.  It has been brought by wounded who announced that a big advance had been made along the peninsula, Australians having been started without ammunition in their pouches to take a place called hill 909 they took it during the night, and if they be sufficiently reinforced they will be able to hold on.   The cost in killed and wounded must have been heavy because several train-loads of seriously wounded, all in a septic condition arrived at the hospitals early in the evening.
