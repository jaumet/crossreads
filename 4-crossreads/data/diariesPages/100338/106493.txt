January

held, and the Henley regatta is held not far away. I left London by the 1.30pm train on the 20th of January and arrived at Mansfield station about 3 hours later. Cousin Frank and Tom came to the station to meet me.

I stayed at Pleasley with Uncle & Auntie until the end of my leave which finished on the end of the month, During my stay there I went to Ilkestone to see Uncle Walter and family. I also went to Nottingham to see Cousin Ethel, and on one day I went together with Uncle Auntie and two or three others to Ripley to see the birthplace of Dad. Everything connected with Dads early days in England was shown and explained to me by Uncle, While at Ripley I visited Mr Robert Walker an old friend of Dad’s. I went to Newhoften to see old Mrs White who writes very regularly
