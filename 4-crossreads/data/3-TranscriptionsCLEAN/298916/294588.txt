  
 ariels being taken down whilst in port, there was no watch to be kept that night. There was just a faint swell on the water that was just enough to cause a gentle rise & fall. The A13 being built for big work was rather light, with the little in her. Immediately after dinner the soldiers one by one would come up from below & would lean over the side uttering fierce vows never to come away to sea again. One soldier who had never even seen the sea said "No & I don't want to see any more of it." In the end, only three soldiers remained "alive" - the others being helpless. I was a good "sailor" myself & it took a lot to make me sick. I swore to myself that I would not be sick & that helped me (for a time). At 9pm we passed Thirroul which was only visible by the tiny specks of light from the street lamps etc. I soon lost my gloomy feeling & turned in at ten o'clock 23/9/14. Next morning I was up at seven & helped Teddy erect the ariels. It was a beautiful sunny day without a cloud in the sky & the A13 was spick & span as the coolies under their serang or chief had been "soogeeing" the paintwork & holystoning" the bridge.
