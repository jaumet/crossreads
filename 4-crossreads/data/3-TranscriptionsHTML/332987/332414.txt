<p>15-6-1918<br/>A stand too, ordered tonight.  Twelve teams to take ammunition up to Bty.  Reserve position.  Our Major sent his kit down to wagon line.  Three of the enemies baloons down in flames, (Troop cheered) and one broke away from its moorings.  All this happened this evening.  Fritz is expected to attack, but I hear that we are about to attack, no definite objectives.  Weather cloudy, and cold.</p>
