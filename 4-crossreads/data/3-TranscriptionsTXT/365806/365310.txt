2really disgusting sight on our way out.  The mud gets on everything right up to your horses ears and a greatcoat weighs about three times its normal weight with mud & water.
Yesterday we rode to the next village & had a hot bath.  It was great.  These baths are a great scheme and are a wonderful saving in underclothing. You simply drop your dirty and pick up clean.
Tomorrow we move again.  This time in Motor Lorries.  It is a grand sight to see a Brigade of men in Motor Lorries.  Each lorry holds 25 so you can get an idea of the size of the column on the move with the cars about 25 yards apart.  Motor Lorries are splendid things but there appears to be some deeply rooted objection to them taking you to your destination.  The usual practice is to go within about 3 to 5 miles of the destination and then for no accountable reason to "debus" as it is called and march
