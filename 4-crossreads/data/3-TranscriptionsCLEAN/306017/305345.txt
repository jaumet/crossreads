 19th to 22nd The weather has been much cooler but nevertheless we have been sending the horses out under the palms each day; on Sunday we took the horses over to the sea for a swim.  Went over to the 1st LH & saw Sgt Mjr Davidson & Douglas Cooper.  Cecil [indecipherable] who was at Nottingham with me is also in the 1st, but is not out here with them having got sick & gone into hospital.  On Monday 22nd the Regiment left camp at 7 am.  They are going 6 miles S.E. of Bir-el-Abd & will probably be away 3 days.  I was not feeling too good the heat evidently has affected me.  I reported sick & got sent into hospital at Port Said.  I stayed there a week & was feeling pretty good when I left for Cairo.  Could have gone back to the
