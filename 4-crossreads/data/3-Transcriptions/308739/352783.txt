<p>Saturday 23 September 1916<br/>The Stunt to Mazzar seems to be a Bungled up concern, so much so that an inquiry is now being held &amp;amp; a number of Leading Officers of the Division appear to be complicated.  Even our Brig. got sick of the whole show &amp;amp; left on his own to return to Camp.  He got lost &amp;amp; lay under a date Palm till morning.  Some of the Brigade Officers spent the night looking for Him without success.  On returning to Camp our Regiment had no water or Feed or Rations for Men, &amp;amp; great difficulty was experienced in providing even Quarter Rations.<br/>There is no doubt that those in Authority are unfitted for their jobs, &amp;amp; new Blood must be infused into the division before good working conditions prevail.<br/>Telegram received that Serg. Wilson of C Squadron whilst on Duty at Port Said slipped between a truck &amp;amp; received severe injuries.  An Operation was performed &amp;amp; both legs were amputated.  He is a fine chap well liked by both Officers &amp;amp; men.  He was sent for the purpose of Buying Canteen requisites.<br/>Col. Fuller to Brigade getting information re 42nd Div.
