October 191627th   I have been riding around in one of the pontoon wagons all day.  We went to Miminetz Wood R.C. yard & took a lot of material out to Longueval  "dump."  Although it has been raining contin  continuously, we have been bombarding Fritz very heavily all day, but very few of his shells have come over our way.28th   I had an easy morning & this afternoon I rode in to Fricourt to the Post Office & Headquarters.  Light rain has been falling during the day & the ground is terribly muddy.
