 1916&nbsp;&nbsp; SATURDAY 23&nbsp;&nbsp; DEC. 
 Very cold &amp; windy &amp; it snowed for about an hour in the morning. I was loading our mobilisation ammunition into the waggons all the morning &amp; got leave till Monday night &amp; went into the Abbey Hotel Amesbury to Mother &amp; Peter. I expected to see Alan there also but he could not get up. Stayed in Hotel all the evening. Got Auntie Florences letter &amp; a watch.
