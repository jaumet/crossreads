<p>Thursday 1st October<br/>More fatigue! Went with a boat party to gather wood in the jungle. The ants crawled over us &amp; bit large junks of beef off our backs.

Needless to say I took immense pleasure in watching Pte O'Brien wielding his axe on the trunk of a huge teak; or ex-constable Sullivan</p>
