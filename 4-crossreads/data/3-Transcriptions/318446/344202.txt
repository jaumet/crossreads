<p>There is no doubt that the biggest problem in this desert warfare is that of supply transport.  Sir Chetwynde [possibly Sir Philip Chetwode] the C. in C. of the Desert Column came out the other day &amp; buttered us about the Magdaba affair.  It appears it is the first time Cavalry have taken trenches.  He also kept us waiting two hours before he showed up, whereat Charlie was very wrath.  Do him good.<br/>I wasn't there myself.<br/>This next stunt will probably be an attempt to take Rafa, which, if managed properly should succeed.<br/>According to Hudson (1st Bgde. Staff Capt.), there are 4 battalions of turks with a battery of guns.  We shall probably have a cruiser &ndash; Rafa is on the coast &ndash; a couple or so of batteries &amp; several battalions of Infantry who will make the frontal attack</p>
