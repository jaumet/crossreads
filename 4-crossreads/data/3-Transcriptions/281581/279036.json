<p>8th February/ 1918</p>
<p>Unsettled weather which broke into heavy rains and wind. Confined to tent and unable to move up to the 67th Flying Squadron, as the roads are impassable for car, and the rails are washed away..</p>
<p>9th Feby /18</p>
<p>Unsettled weather again stormy and heavy rains all day. Communications held up. I am regretting keenly the loss of time, as the time for my departure is drawing close and I find myself unable to shift owing to impossibility of transport. Evening went to 11th Light Horse Mess, where a concert was held. The evening one of the most  jovial and enjoyable I have ever been at. A Troup of entertainers amused the company with Topical Songs and a fine display of Juggling feats.</p>
