<p>We arrived at Suez at 9 P.M. &amp; anchored in the stream<br/><u>Tuesday 12th January</u>.<br/>At Suez we encountered the usual collection of [indecipherable]boat men with their motley wares.<br/>Left Suez 11 AM &amp; had a clear run through the Canal &ndash; we hadn't to tie up once &ndash; but plenty of vessels proceeding in the opposite direction had to stand aside for us &ndash; apparently we took precedence over them though being a transport.    Soon after entering the Canal we passed camps of Indian soldiers who were guarding the canal.   Warlike preparations were in great evidence in the entrenchments earth works, barbed wire entanglements &amp; sandbag redoubts.    These works were situated about a mile apart on both sides of the Canal.   From some of the officers we learnt that the Turks were only two days march from the Canal &amp; an attack was expected at any time.   As we passed each camp the sentries turned out &amp; presented arms.  On numerous occasions we had enquiries from the shore &ndash; Who are you? where are you going? are we downhearted?<br/>It was a very different trip to the last one I had had through the Canal &ndash; no donkeys, &amp; no boys running along the banks &amp; turning somersaults, no mendicants &ndash; nothing but tall swarthy &amp; exceedingly business like looking Indian soldiers.</p>
