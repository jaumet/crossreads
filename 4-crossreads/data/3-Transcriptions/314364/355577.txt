<p>[The diarist has set out a calendar for the seven and a half weeks ahead and has crossed off each day.  Initials across the top of the calendar are probably the initials of people he writes to. The initials are D.T.G.B.I.S.B.E.]<br/>Tues. Apr. 1st Our last Day in Quarantine. It has seemed a long time going, but now it's gone it only seems like a Pleasant dream. Thanks to the War Chest &amp; Comforts Fund, our stay here has been made very pleasant. Last night a Southerly Buster blew &amp; down came many of the tents. Luckily ours was well pegged down &amp; stood the strain. The mess tents were blown down &amp; we had Breakfast in the open air. I was rather disappointed at not getting a Letter from B.E. but I suppose they have been busy preparing for tomorrow. After Dinner we erected the Mess Tent. It rained almost all day &amp; made things rather unpleasant. We had a sing song in the Y.M. tonight, which passed away a very pleasant couple of hours. It is 9 o'clock now &amp; we are going to Bed to prepare for the <u>Great &amp; Glorious Morrow</u></p>
