<p>this &amp; dropped to sleep in perfect contentment.</p>
<p>June 30.   Too wet for parade.    Alan &amp; I took a short walk around the camp.   We examined an old aeroplane, a six inch reserve howitzer and a four-wheel drive motor lorry, by way of curiosity.   The evening again found our happy family, like sardines, in the tent.   Heavy firing continued all night.</p>
<p>July 1 Sunday.   Church Parade in the open-air.   The day was cold &amp; inclined to be wet &amp; we stayed in the tent most of the time, "arguing the toss" about one thing and another.   After tea I went looking for Fritz bullets etc. as souvenirs "de la guerre".   There are hundreds of German bullets, shells, bombs, etc etc everywhere &amp; I only wish I had some means of sending them home.</p>
<p>July 2   Drill again, in fact , "interum iterumque"</p>
