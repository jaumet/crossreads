<p>1917 Thursday 26 April</p>
<p>Up for breakfast at 8 a.m. tis hard to take (?) Duties for an hour, clean up &amp; free for rest of day. Over to Y.M. C A for cup of cocoa &amp; to write this &amp; letters. Write all afternoon &amp; read.<br/>After tea,   A.Carruthers, Bert. R. "Johno" Ridgy &amp; self walk over to Thiepval &amp; view the ruins &amp; massive German defences --- truly the taking of that post was a magnificent piece of work for the British troops. Such a wilderness of shell holes &amp; wreckage. Thiepval Chateau all that's left of it, a few bricks, underground passages, Tank, dead Fritzes,   Duds. Ugh! such grusome sights, make very little impression after all these months. Life's held very cheaply.</p>
