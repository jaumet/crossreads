the beastly Huns while we are at it.We are having good weather here now, & the summer is coming on us week by week.  It will be a lovely sight here soon when harvesting is on I do wish I could whisk you all at home over here for a while to show you what France is like at this time of year.  At present it is crops everywhere sometimes oats, barley, rye, & a lot of potatoes.A lot of places are worked entirely by the womenfolk, who do the harrowing, cultivating etc quite unassisted.On Saturday Wal & I walked out to where Rid was billeted & gave that gentleman quite a shock by our united appearance.  He & Wal nearly embraced each other in their happiness at seeing each other & had qut quite an old gossipy yarn over matters in general.I am keeping in splendid health & strength & sincerely trust that this finds you all well.Must close now, with love to all,Your loving son,Leo
