<p>Saturday Sept 29th<br/>Feeling crook this morning. Altho the sea isnt very rough, I suppose it was through sleeping below, as it is very stuffy &amp; hot down there. I feel as if I dont want to eat anything &amp; the mere talk of going below makes me shudder. I haven't vomited yet tho. A pal of mine brought up my tea &amp; bed, so I am set now until tomorrow. We have six destroyers &amp; a battle cruiser with us now. One of the destroyers started firing at something just after dinner, at first of course all thought it was a submarine, but later it was found out to be some wreckage they were breaking up, so as not to cause injury to any other boat.</p>
<p>My cobber &amp; myself have a sleeping posey on No 2 hatch, no more sleeping blow for mine. Everybody is looking forward to some pay, the rumor is they are going to give us a pound &amp; two pounds worth of canteen chits, but I dont think the troops will stand for it as they like to have the hard cash. Things are very cheap in the canteen. I suppose it is because there is no duty: Tobacco &amp; cigarettes are exceptionally cheap, tobacco is 6d for 2 oz tin, cigarettes 2d per packet.</p>
