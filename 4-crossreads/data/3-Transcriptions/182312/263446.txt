<p>sorted and as the mail steamer brings over 15 to 20 tons of mail</p>
<p>per day, this takes some doing and all the while the pinnaces and</p>
<p>drifters from the various ships are hovering about waiting for their</p>
<p>share.&nbsp; The Captain of this Depot Ship is Capt. Chambers who was</p>
<p>loaned to the Australian Navy to act as Commandant of the new Naval</p>
<p>College at Jervis Bay.&nbsp; He was just settling down to this job when</p>

<p>Dreadnaughts and I admit that I don&#39;t know now any more about how it</p>
<p>is done than before I joined the ship;&nbsp; and this is not because they</p>
<p>try to hide anything from you, on the contrary they are most</p>
