<p>&amp; we saw it out together at Caestre. When we joined the unit he went to C section &amp; his brother &amp; so I lost touch with him, until the services &amp; the education scheme brought us together again. He was a very energetic member of the literary circle.</p>
<p>I remember how on many occasions he voluntarily helped me in my activities, as when he did the printing work for the drama at Dimonts.</p>
<p>Both he &amp; his brother are or were Quakers, &amp; he was very simple in regards to worldly affairs. With my usual thoughtlessness &amp; self satisfaction I more than once lost patience with him because of some apparently silly lack of judgement. If only I had as much insight as I occasionally fancy I have, I should not quarrel so often, should lose patience much</p>
