<p>France<br/>19.7.1917<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>I fear this letter must appear frightfully dull. Fact is, the same old war topics still fill the day, and I am sure you don't want to hear these -    We having been having a pretty rough spin lately, not in the way of fighting so much as being constantly changing position, and all means work work, work, constructing gun pits etc &ndash;</p>
<p>We always look forward to a good long spell out of the line to do some training but of course something is always doing</p>
