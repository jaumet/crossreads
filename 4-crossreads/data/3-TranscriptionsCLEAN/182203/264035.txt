Dearest Folk. Just received a lovely mail from Australia - with three letters from home - and a small sweet letter from my dear old Mother. Of course I had a little cry of joy when I read my long-looked for letters. Best news too - no doubt you will all be very delighted to know I had an awfully nice, loving letter from Lucy, in answer to one  wrote her.  So please do all make friends again & let by-gones be by-gones. She is very lonely & would love to see "dear Auntie Belle" but thinks you don't want her. Oh, poor old Lucy, I do feel sorry for her - I'm that pleased she wrote such a nice letter  & that it makes me feel happy now to know that we are friends once more. Will write to her to-morrow night - am fearfully sleepy now. We had a most delightful afternoon
