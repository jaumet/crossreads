Had a half day off duty.

The day was just such a one as makes one think of Merry, Merry Springtime. I spent the afternoon lying in the field behind our isolation hospital. The beautiful green grass, the cows grazing in amongst the buttercups and daisies, the hot sun and the quiet peacefulness of the whole scene made one wonder if such was the case what the newspapers are full of namely war in France. Yet only three miles away the contending forces of the Allies and the Germans are face to face.

The quietness of this peaceful scene was occasionally broken by the ringing of the college bell calling the children from the play ground to their lessons and the dull thud of anti-air craft guns as they pelted shell after shell high up in the air at an enemy aeroplane who is out reconnoitring. After one of these Anti-Air Craft bombardments the sky with its hundreds of small puffs of smoke each puff representing a shell burst gave one the impression of the starry sky at night time.

Walking along by the side of a hedge away from the village out into the country this evening I came across a nest of the [indecipherable] with four eggs in it.

The sounds of a heavy Artillery bombardment away in the distance can be heard.
