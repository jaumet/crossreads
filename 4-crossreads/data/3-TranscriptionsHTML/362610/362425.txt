<p>Friday 28 July 1916<br/>During the morning waiting for orders to move, but nothing doing until in afternoon when I went down to see about the loading of a motor lorry with packs of the men, afterwards coming on in charge of it : was thus saved a 9 mile march &amp; was not sorry for it. We reached La Vicogne about midnight &amp; had very rough &amp; crowded billets.</p>
