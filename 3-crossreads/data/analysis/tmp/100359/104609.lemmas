All the harm " Fritz " did was to explod our bomb store . Saturday 23rd Slept in till about 10 , when one of the " Scotti 's " came and haul us out of our bunk . It was too late to cook breakfast , so we just made some tea and had a piec of bread and jam . These Gordon are a hardi crowd they wear noth under their kilt , not even in the depth of winter . There is a parti of Engineer work just across from our dug-out and Fritz 's look out must have caught sight of ?em , as he "plonk " a few shell in amongst them , but no one was hurt .
