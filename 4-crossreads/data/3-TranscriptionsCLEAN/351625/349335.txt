My possy consists of a shell hole with the sides scraped in so as to make it flat a the the bottom, this with a good coating of grass and a couple of German waterproof sheets suspended by a pole tent fashion over the top of us & a jolly comfortable possy it makes to being in a shell hole.  We are below the surface which gives us protection from bombs, us consists of another chap Lce./Corp. Riley [?] is his name & myself.
