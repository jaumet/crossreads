<p>certainly looked as though he had. Have been out trench digging this evening. The hands are a bit soft now for using the pick &amp; shovel but that will soon pass off. There is no doubt the horses here look well have coats like silk &amp; so they should as they are well fed &amp; doing practically no work. They are taken out night &amp; morning for exercise. I dare say they think war not at all bad if this is what they call war. The instructers we have here are English. All men that have seen service in France. They all admire the Australian as a fighter but say there only fault is want of discipline. There is also a feeling of resentment. The Military Police are also wounded men from France or the Dardenell's. The troops don't hit it with them at all. There have been a couple of riots between them needless to say some one gets hurt. The natives are very amusing. They profess to be very partial to the Australians. When you are passing them they will always say Australian very good. good fighter got plenty money. The money side is what appeals to them I am afraid. I posted some Xmas cards to all last week. Randwick also hope you receive them. They are not up to much but were the best I could get here. Well Father I don't think there is anything else I can tell you this time will close. Hope to have something of interest to tell you next week<br/>Love &amp; best wishes From your sincere son<br/>Clyde</p>
