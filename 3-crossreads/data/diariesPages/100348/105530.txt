The sea is wonderfully calm today, not a ripple, a perfect day too and we are in the dreadful Red Sea? We are warned for disembarkation tomorrow so there is much bustle and movement.

In the outer harbour at Suez at daylight. Draw alongside the quay and disembark at 4 P.M. Boarded the train that is to take us to Cario. The train is a "keystone" affair with its little engine and nigger box carriages. They are something like that Missisippi steam boat; when they blow the whistle, she stops! We are travelling very slowly over the desert There are interesting sights everywhere There are a great many niggers about riding donkeys and working in the gardens. Troops seem to be everywhere we passed one enormous camp.
