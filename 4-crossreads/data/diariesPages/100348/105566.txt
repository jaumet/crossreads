They seem to be at a loss to know what to do with us; for I reckon the drill of this company is perfect; they come to us for all the ceremonial parties now. Went for a march beyond "Camaires" a fair sized town along the Bolougne road. It is pleasant to march among the green woods and fields. Went rabbiting in the sand hills this evening, caught one big fellow. I suppose the next thing will be an order against poaching.

On duty as orderly to the quarter Guard, an easy job. There were any amount of aeroplanes about today; stunting about the sky. One takes no notice of them now, for aeroplanes and airships are to be seen any day now. One big British airship named "Silver Queen", patrols the coast regularly, spotting for "U" Boats.
