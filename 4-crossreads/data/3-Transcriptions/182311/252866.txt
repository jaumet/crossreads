<p>has told me to hand over, though he has written to higher authority on the case, but I do not anticipate an answer favourable to myself.&nbsp; So I&#39;ll soon be Platoon Commander of old No.4 again, it will <u>do</u> <u>me</u> however, for I&#39;m keen on the job in whatever capacity I have to act.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With every good wish,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours</p>
