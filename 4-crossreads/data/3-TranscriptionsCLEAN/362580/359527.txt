 My dear old Belle, 
 Received your nice long letter last night also the photos.  I think they are splendid and I'm awfully delighted to have them. 
 Eddy seems to have grown very much and looks quite a little trick in his "Soldier's Uniform". Dear old Mother looks just the same & very well.  You look thinner than the others.  It is a good one of Jane & Al.  Hope you like the snap I sent of myself.  I received such a nice affectionate letter from poor old Lucy & I do hope you are all happy together once more.  I shall scribble a few lines to her this mail. 
 Poor old boys are on the move again; Fred has left here but not very far also George & Norman.  Nearly all our friends are having changes.  I think Dorothy is still at Heliopolis but no doubt I shall see her next Friday - I'm having the day-off, so
