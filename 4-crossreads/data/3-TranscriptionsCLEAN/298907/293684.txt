  
 We had a bonza concert here last night all girls from 6 to 21 & they were very fine I enjoyed myself. You should see the cigarettes & stuff these concert people distrubite quite surprising at times. 
 Went to the dentist this morning to see about my teeth, he reckons I want 3 fillings & a small bridge very nice I'm sure especially the fillings 
 19th. Anniversary of the great Turkish attack & this time 3 years we were shooting Turks like rabbits 
 A chap from the 8th Bn. named Haddon & I went to the Catherdal this morning (Sunday), all the little blue coat boys & girls were here & very clean & smart they looked this is a charitable instution & does a lot of good over in this part of the world, I enjoyed the service though
