<p>Rogers to build a swagger fireplace with chimney of sheet iron or tin &amp; real bricks for fireplace.  This job kept us warm &amp; fairly happy throughout the day.  The fatigue party whose greatest effort was making exclamations of admiration at the result of our ingenuity are <strike>nowing</strike> now discussing where we learnt to <strike>do</strike> make so many "gadgettes".  They have placed me as a chap who rose from navvy to artist (quite correct) and Sergt. Rogers as an architect who descended from a high position in civil life for the purpose of helping his country.  Our prolonged stay here means no mail from you until we get to Cairo unless I can get a cable through asking for letters to be sent on here.</p>
<p>I trust always in a merciful providence that watches over you;  it is the habit of bad husbands so to do.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert<br/>Capt. A.I.F.<br/>War Records Section<br/><strike>C/o A.I.F. H.Q.</strike> Cairo<br/>C/o A.I.F. Headquarters</p>
