<p>We had just turned into the entrance of the station when a big shell exploded right in the centre of the Station Yard which was already crowded with troops waiting to entrain. I felt the splinters flying past me &amp; I was 50 yards from the burst &ndash; I have no idea how many it got</p>
<p>The order was given to clear the station &amp; we marched off down the road till the shelling was over &ndash; We <strike>waited</strike> halted there till long after dark &ndash; bitterly cold &amp; raining &amp; did not entrain till about midnight in pitch blackness &ndash;</p>
