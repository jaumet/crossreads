Received 2 fine big parcels to night one from N.S.W. and the other from home.
12th Heavy rain fell last night, when we got up this morning it was snowing heavily but there was a lot of rain falling at the same time so it did not lay long. 
Had the usual digging fatigue this morning and we done some good work though it was cold and wet. 2 more of my men are going to hospital shortly I think and neither of them have seen a firing line as yet.
A funny little incident happened this evening we were all sitting round a nice hot coal fire cracking jokes and chaffing one another for we had just finished our tea when the door opened and Charlie Harrison stepped in and I said jokingly "hands in your pockets"
