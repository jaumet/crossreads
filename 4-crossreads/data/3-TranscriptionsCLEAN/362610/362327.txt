Friday 21 April 1916A Good Friday in many respects vastly different to any yet spent. The morning was clear & still, the sunshine being glorious after the weather experienced recently. A special parade to a steam laundry in Etaples was arranged so as to enable the men to do their washing, but I got permission to remain & attend the Church Parade at 10 a.m. It was taken by an English C. of E. chaplain who spoke on "Greater love hath no man...". Between the hymns (led by the band) came the joyous songs of sky-larks, high up above us in strange contrast to the bang of bombs being used by bombing parties on the training ground on the sand dunes some little distance inland. Later on in the day this gave place to the far distant boom of heavy guns seemingly from out at sea. Most of the afternoon was taken up with company affairs. A mail in from Aust. bringing me 1 (W.E.C. No. 7). Drizzling again during the evening. Rumours of 500 000 Russians landing at Marseilles.
