<p>It was only on our arrival at Port that we heard the very sad news and big loss by Empire by the death of Lord Kitchener who was on board the illfated "Hampshire" which was mined while crossing Channel on 5th inst.<br/>We also got more news of the Naval Battle and it proved to be a <strike>better</strike> bigger battle than anticipated.  We here tonight that 14 British and 40 German boats were sunk.  Also received the good news of a Russian offensive in which 65000 of the enemy were captured.<br/>Had a very quiet day today and no leave was granted.  At night however the "Marathon" with Headquarters staff and Brig. General Jobson on board came into port and we gave them a great reception.  They dropped anchor near us for the night.<br/>Received a letter from Mina (cousin) from Capetown containing a Golliwog as a mascot and answered it.<br/>The view at sunset or just after of Table Mountain was excellent and we could see the whole mountain for first time.<br/>But the view at night with the thousands of lights of city with the mountain as a background was truly wonderful.</p>
<p>Tuesday 13th<br/>Very quiet day.  Made nather insistent application to obtain leave but Major Hunt to whom we were paraded promised us satisfaction.  We never heard any more of it that day.<br/>We are expecting the "Hororata"</p>
