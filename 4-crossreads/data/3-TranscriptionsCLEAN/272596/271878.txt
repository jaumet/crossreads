  
 "rummy", casino, 7's & so on, & there has never been a squabble the whole time, because no money was hanging to it I suppose, anyhow the old "broads" as they are called have helped us wonderfully 
 20th. According to what I can hear fumigation yesterday was an even bigger farce than I thought it was for the clothes that were put in the room never had a thing done to them, the boys just took them out as they were put in. 
 Dinner just over, have been laying on the broad of my back all the morning right "forrard" sunning myself for it is a nice morning though a heavy wind is blowing & the sea beginning to get rougher, spray is flying all over the place & the ship is starting to roll heavily but we are nearly out of the "Bight"
