 On the 9th Lieut. A.V. Tonkin (pilot) and Lieut. C.J. Vyner (observer) took off in response to an enemy aircraft alarm call. North of DIER ALLA they saw an enemy two-seater machine at 13000 feet which they pursued for 50 miles behind the enemy's lines but were unable to overtake it.

When attacked by our two machines the formation broke up, and all enemy machines were driven down onto the aerodrome at JENIN. In breaking off the engagement they were aided by low lying clouds. 
 A large concentration of cavalry was observed on the coast near MUKHALID, where horse lines and mens shelters were cleverly 'comouflaged' and concealed on the steep hillsides near the foreshore.
