Fine. Owie Cadell & I got leave
to go down to Vueuf Bequin
for the dayto see Laurie
Cadell. We spent the day
with him there & got back
home about 10 oclock at night
Saw Les Tooth there, he is a Lieut
in the 49th Bat machine guns.
We moved the Left section
to our new position by [Cinder?]
Farm. Fritz blew up a dump
just behind our line & made
a hell of a splash.
