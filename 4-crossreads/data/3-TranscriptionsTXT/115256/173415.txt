 Australia's Army 
 Oh! a soldier's life is free from care, He revels in cake and ginger beer; For the law makes us all teetotallers here, And a soldier mustn't get balmy. We're not very clean, I own;  but then A wash isn't very easy when There are only three taps to a thousand men. It's a way we've got in the Army. 
 We get as you know the princely pay Of five bright shillings for every day; And I for one, would willingly say Such a rich reward would charm me, Were it not for the fact, which is sad but true, That it's always a fornight overdue &ndash; I swear that I'm not deceiving you &ndash; It's a way we've got in the army. 
 As the A.I.F., of course, must eat, We get 'dixies' loaded with wholesome meat; But they seem to think that I'm so replete That any more food would harm me. For I always find &ndash; and I'm not alone &ndash; That all that is left is fat and bone; So I cuddle my empty plate and groan &ndash;  It's a way we've got in the Army.
