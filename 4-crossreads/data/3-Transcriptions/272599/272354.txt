<p>March Saturday 24 1917</p>
<p>A cold &amp; biting wind, several degrees of frost. The past week has been a mixture of snow rain wind &amp; hail, --the final wrestlings of winter. <br/>Trip into Albert for paper after tea. <br/>Daylight &ndash; Saving:- Summer Time comes in tonight. Shift our watches on an hour before morning.</p>
