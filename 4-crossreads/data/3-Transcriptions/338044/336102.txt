<p>largest to Cairo. Old men on donkeys  &amp;  veiled women are met with all along the line</p>
<p>1st Nov 1915:-<br/>Owing to our late arrival we did not have to appear on first Parade (6 am). Awoke about 7 am still feeling tired &amp; at once had to shake the sand out of our blankets &amp; these with kits are lined up outside the tent &amp; strange to say are seldom taken by anybody. A long walk to the taps with flies swarming around  &amp; at 9-30 am we fall in  A short route march around the desert follows &amp;  we are dismissed at 11-30 am. We have a rest    &amp;  dinners at 1 pm. For breakfast we went to the canteen but things get gradually more settled &amp;  we get our mess. The food is better than Liverpool &amp;  we mess in a shed with tables &amp; forms</p>
