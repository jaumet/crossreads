<p>Cape Galle with the famous Galle Face Hotel in the distance.  Colombo Harbor was absolutely crammed with shipping- men-o-war, colliers and transports.  Tom is very busy taking photos of every conceivable thing and Gillan is improving the shining hour making fun of the natives in their coracles below.  Hal of course is bartering with said natives for cigars and cocoanuts.  Colombo itself looks an awfully interesting town nestling at the bottom of a hill but we will not have a closer inspection unfortunately as we sail again almost immediately.</p>
