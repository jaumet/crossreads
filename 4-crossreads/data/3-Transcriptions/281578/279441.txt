<p>the same old thing again, shoved into billets, 80 were put in a big shed. I struck a sort of room with a board floor for a change, 24 of us. I'd much rather a hayshed &amp; straw. The fellows boiled some water in their mess tins, made tea, we got out our bully &amp; bread &amp; had dinner, 3 p.m. Boots &amp; puttees all mud, wonder when a chap will have the pleasure of polishing his boots among pleasant surroundings away from war's proximity again! Wrote up my diary after eating, then took a walk up town, &amp; got a shock when I saw trenches dug through the town &amp; up the hill. It looks as if they expect the Hun to drive us back further still, &amp; are getting trenches ready to fall back on. I went into a cemetry &amp; had a look at French graves, some were very fine stones &amp; vaults. Came back to the billet, &amp; talk about rough! some of our chaps had pinched a fowl, potatoes, carrots, &amp; had the "chook" on boiling. An old woman spotted another cove taking sheaves from the loft to put on the board floor, &amp; said "No bon" &amp; took it from him, but she would have said more than "No Bon" if she knew her fowls had been reduced</p>
