To-day we're pretty right but for 48 hours I did nothing save my bare duty -Rabaul is pretty & green - hot & damp - Not a ship was in the harbor - war - or otherwise when we anchored - Presently a boat came off & Lambson (Morru L) was in it - No news save about the S & G & Dresden & Nurnbourg - all sunk - This is excellent for with it out goes all petty useless resistance by small bodies of Germans who relied on the 2nd advent of their armed cruisers - no mail leaves here before January but I hear I can wire - The Eastern - a store ship - came in & the Una (Comet) Capt Jackson has come in - They've been at Wilhelmshaven & we were first here - we spotted Capt-T-flew the Senior1 officers pennant - The Destroyers are away up a river in New Guinea & what we are to do we don't know at present - Coal is the 1st thing - We've 18 tons inboard - Food is a difficulty too - We had 3 sheep sent us from a broken down refrigerator & I promptly condemned the lot aided by 2 other officers (3 have to survey but I do the necessary).
