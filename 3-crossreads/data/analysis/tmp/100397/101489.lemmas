 that I had a letter from J. Howel . he was up at Salisburi , and expect to leav for Franc at ani time They were to be sent over to the Train Base over there , it is near Bologn . I may manag to meet him over there . So far I have not heard from Harri . I will have to write to Horseferri Road and tri to find out whether he has land here yet . A coupl of day befor I left Wareham it start to snow , then rain a littl on top of it and at night froze hard . The Place was love it was so slipperi that we had a job to walk about , sever of the men came down and hurt themselv I had one fall and jar my back but it is allright now The Road from Wareham to Dorchest was veri Pretti . The field on either side were white with snow , and the hedg were part cover but it made walk tiresom for in some Part the Road were veri slipperi and in other rough , but I had plenti of time so it did not matter . I did not see anyth worth write about in Dorchest , as it was dark when I arriv there and I was onli there for one hour . I would have like to stay there for a coupl of day as it is the Princip town in Dorset , and has some queer old build in it .
