 Friday 19th Still a very heavy wind blowing and our progress is slow. A storm overtook us during afternoon and a series of heavy showers followed  so  which made air so foggy that Captain had to persist in his whistle. At noon we were opposite the most southerly point of Ceylon (Cape Tegan) and still have 90 miles to go to Colombo.  Did 236 miles for 24 hours. At nightfall we stopped as we could not enter Colombo Harbour until after dusk. The rain simply poured at 8 p.m. and continued for an hour or so.   The  Our Troop Deck sprang a leak and I climbed to top of a ventilator (the higher type) and turned the top which remedied the defect.  However the night went quickly  and  and next morning. 
 Colombo Saturday 20th Was awakened by  sound  cries of "Colombo at last" and on looking was surprised to find we were just entering the Harbour which consisted of a breakwater and a point of land.  The land is extended so that at the entrance there is only room for one ship at a time.
