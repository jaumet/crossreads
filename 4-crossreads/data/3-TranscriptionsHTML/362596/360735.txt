<p>(please no. your letters)<br/>We had two days march from our first billets to here and we marched past General Jeffre and we had our own travelling kitchens to cook for us and the band so it was a real picnic, and then we had a few days rest and we went into the trenches but it was very quiet nothing like Gallipoli for rifle fire but we got a few coal boxes or shells over but we give them some back with interest. The only thing that is troubling us is we have a cat and if we get a gas attack he is very likely to go short of a respirator and we don't want to lose him as he has been with us all the way from Egypt. We are only in the trenches for a few days and then we get relieved and we come back to our billets and have a rest which we can do with. I got two letter from Bill he is in England and seems to be having a great time but he has to undergo another operation.<br/>We had a great treat today we were taken for a hot bath provided by the Military and we can give in our dirty clothes and get clean ones back so we will be able to keep ourselves clean</p>
