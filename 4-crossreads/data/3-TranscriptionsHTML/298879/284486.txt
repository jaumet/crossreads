<p>December 1915<br/>Wednesday 22<br/>Rifle inspection. We are all ready to move out of camp any time. We got our Xmas billies today one per man and they contained some very useful articles.</p>
<p>Thursday 23<br/>Cool    Wind blowing from South.  We marched out about half a mile and the Col. gave us a lecture. He told us that since the evacuation at Anzac the Turks bombarded our front heavily and then charged. They swarmed triumphantly down the gullies and Navy cut them up badly.</p>
