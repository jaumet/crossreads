We also got a ride in a Motor Car round Colombo. This also was provided free by the Y.M.C.A.
There are some fine book shops in the Town.
J.B. and I went round the various sights in a Rickshaw, visiting amongst others, the Cinnamon Garden and the market. This place was crowded with native people selling fruit and vegetables. We bought a couple of huge bunches of grapes also oranges and limes.
Black Ebony elephants were also a great favourite as a purchase by the troops. They were large assortments of beautiful silk goods for sale and many soldiers bought these things to bring home with them.
We had a most enjoyable stay in Colombo. I liked the city very much.
The average native is much cleaner here that the native of Egypt.
