 My dearest cousin Although we are quite strangers I feel I must write and express my deep sympathy in your great sorrow for the loss of a dearly loved son. We are passing through the same as our youngest son was killed in the terrible Lone Pine charge and my heart  goes out in sympathy to all such bereaved parents Yours sincerely Mary Street  nee Stafford
