<p>Sunday 30 April 1916<br/>Only a week since Easter &amp; what a change!!<br/>Stables as usual in morning, worked hard till dinner time and then had part of the afternoon off.  Had to turn out at 8 p.m. to give horses lucerne.  Horse died this evening.</p>
<p>Monday 1 May 1916<br/>Stables as usual.  Got dead horse overboard.  Another one died.<br/>One boiler leaking so are only doing about seven knots per hour.<br/>Beverage got mumps &amp; two chaps found to have crabbies.  We are terribly under maned and can't look after horses properly.</p>
