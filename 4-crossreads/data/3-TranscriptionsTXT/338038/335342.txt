to - I am just writing this sitting up in my bunk at 7 am. We are in tents back here, & find the life above ground agrees with one ever so much more than a dug out existence. Weather the last few days has been beautifully warm & fine, almost like Australian spring days.Letters from Exeter this last few weeks have been ever so much more cheerful - They had been to Bournemouth for Easter which seemed to buck them up considerably.
Anzac day here was only sufficient to stir up mild enthusiasm among the[indecipherable] days here. Some of the Regiments of in rest held sports etc. but we gave it a bye. The thing is inclined to be overdone anyhow.
