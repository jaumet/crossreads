<p>(7).</p>
<p>glasses to my eyes but my friend the Commander who is already pre-</p>
<p>paring to fire the next salvo, tells me that there is no hurry.&nbsp; And</p>
<p>he was right.&nbsp; The range was known so was the velocity of the shot</p>
<p>and just before the shot should reach its mark some wonderful</p>
<p>machine sounds a hooter in the foretop at which everybody directs</p>
<p>his glasses at the target just in time to see eight geysers rise up</p>
<p>on the horizon nicely round that speck of a target.&nbsp; By this time all</p>
<p>the ships are sending off broadsides at the rate of two in less than</p>
<p>a minute and the target is frequently obscured by the columns of water</p>
<p>rising when the shot strikes.&nbsp; The ships turn about and round go the</p>
<p>guns still pouring in their broadsides.&nbsp; Which splashes belonged to</p>
<p>which ship I couldn&#39;t tell but there is an observer on that trawler</p>
<p>who knows and within an hour each ship will receive a chart shewing</p>
<p>exactly where each shot fell.&nbsp; Five minutes after the last salvo was</p>
<p>fired I was drinking tea with the Gunnery Commander in his cabin -</p>
<p>his work was over, it was the duty of someone else to take the ship</p>
<p>back to harbour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another occasion we were out for a bit of work in</p>
<p>repelling night attacks of submarines and other torpedo craft.</p>
<p>Again targets were provided, and the ship had to find them with her</p>
<p>searchlights and strafe them with her smaller armourment, all of which</p>
<p>she did to satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An invitation to go out in a destroyer doing her 24</p>
<p>hours patrol in the North Sea didn&#39;t appeal to me.&nbsp; I don&#39;t mind</p>
<p>being seasick when it is necessary, but I don&#39;t hanker after looking</p>
<p>for it.&nbsp; Nevertheless I had ample opportunity to see the destroyers</p>
<p>at their work both in conjunction with the battle squadrons and at</p>
<p>their own evolutions and I must say that to a layman like myself</p>
<p>the work of the destroyers possesses more thrills than that of the</p>
