<p>Tuesday 20 February</p>
<p>Too tired to get up in time for breakfast.  I went into Southampton for a few hours this morning.  Passed the remainder of the day in writing at the Salvation Army Hut opposite on in the Y.M.C.A. Hut.<br/>In the evening, though no leave was granted we all found a way of getting into Southampton.<br/>No boats to France yet.</p>
