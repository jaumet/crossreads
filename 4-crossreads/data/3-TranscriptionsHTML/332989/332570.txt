<p>weather is beginning to break now and get a little warmer with not quite so much rain    Everywhere in the country is just one mass of cultivation &amp; Verdure, no waste or bare ground visible anywhere, even right up to the trenches you see all the fields cultivated &amp; growing crops everywhere.   It is hard to realise at times that there is a war going on until you hear some extra heavy bombardment &amp; the rattle of the machine guns, when you wake up and duck.   We get well fed &amp; well clothes here much better than when we were</p>
