<p>Mar 31st Sunday Fine day except for a few showers. We took a heavy load of R.E. Stores to spoil bank in the morning. Fritz was shelling with shrapnell &amp; H.E. Frank &amp; I were sick (also Budge &amp; Tuck) from the effects of some gas we got into at Vermozeele yesterday. We had no trip on in the afternoon so worked on the lorry.</p>
<p>April 1st We took R.E. stores to spoil bank in the morning &amp; in the afternoon took a load of troops to Poperinzhe - fine day. I went to the Cemetery (new military cemetery) on the whipenhoek road &amp; found Hec&#39;s grave. I saw the attendant &amp; gave him 30 francs to put up a decent wooden cross, painted &amp; inscribed, he showed me a sample one &amp; it was very good. Went back to our park at Neuve Eglise.</p>
<p>Apr 2nd We went to spoil Bank with R.E. material in the morning &amp; in the afternoon there being no run I adjusted the selector-rods. I am getting the lorry into better condition gradually. We took a walk into Neuve Eglise in the evening (we were parted about 3/4 of a mile down the Kemmel road) &amp; watched the Aust. heavy guns being placed in position.</p>
