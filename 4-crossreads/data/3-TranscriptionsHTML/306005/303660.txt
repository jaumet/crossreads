The 1st Regt was in reserve. The New Zealanders &amp; 3rd Bde commenced the ball rolling by opening out &amp; galloping around the Turks position, &amp; the 2nd &amp; 3rd Regt of this Bde soon followed; 4 of our aeroplanes was out early &amp; gave us the exact position of the Turks by dropping bombs on them; It was a fine sight to see the Troops galloping into position &amp; the rattle of machine guns</p>
