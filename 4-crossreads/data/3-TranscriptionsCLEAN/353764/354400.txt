  
 The sun was sweltering hot & the mirage on the Desert was very trying to the eyes. We arrived at the Ranges after an hours march & immediately got to business.  I scored a fair average, but nothing to speak of.  I hope to do better tomorrow as my eye is now in. It was very inspiring to hear the thousands of bullets all rattling over the Desert & one naturally wondered how on earth any force of men could possibly charge up in the face of such an awful curtain of bullets. I am going out again to-morrow, but I feel far from fit as I am very tired. 
 11.2.16  Thursday  Friday Another hard day at the range & returned very tired.  Have just been ordered to go out for another 6 days & am quite faint about it as two days has played the devil with me.  I am sure I will be deaf when it is all over. I have seen in orders that the Osterley has arrived with some Artillery so am wondering whether Jack is among them.  Will make enquiries on Sunday. 
 12.2.16  Friday  Saturday Finished off another day on
