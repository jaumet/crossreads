<p>Fri. May 4.  It's about time another mail was in.  After Dinner, Bill Williams, Nick Coxon &amp; I walked out to Mametz to the Div Sports.  It was a very warm day &amp; I actually raised a sweat, the first one since I came back from the Line.  There was big crowd there &amp; the events went off very well.  "Billgy" May &amp; "Shag" Shearer came 2nd in the Stretcher Bearer's race, they should have got first, but failed to do some little item &amp; lost points.  Our Q.M. McFadyon won the Officer's Race &ndash; flying  &amp; Tommy Ross &amp; Les Foote won the 3 legged Race.  We came away at about 4, got a lift in a Motor Lorry part of the way, &amp; had a glass of Beer &amp; a good Bath when we arrived back at Bellvue Farm.<br/>.<br/>Sat. MAY 5.  Capt. Riley fixed up my Tooth.  Last night we had a meeting in the Mess Hut to decide about giving a Show at the Reinf. Camp.  Fred Winter, Charley Hall &amp; Capt Marshall went on leave.</p>
<p>Sun. May 6.  Glorious day.  The Trees are bursting into bloom &amp; look very pretty.  The news from then front continues good, but the slaughter must be terrible on both sides.  After Tea Bill Williams &amp; I went for a stroll along the Becordel Road &amp; came across a big crowd of Reinf. On their way to the Front Line.  They looked in the Pink of Condition.</p>
