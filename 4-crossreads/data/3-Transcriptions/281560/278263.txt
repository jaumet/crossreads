<p>24/6/16.<br/>The line here is a high breast work. Trenches being impossible because water is only 18 inches down. The breast work is very strong but a lot of labour is necessary to keep it in repair. I am on post observing the enemy line for four hours each night, and do fatigue in my spare time. The hun trenches are four hundred yards from this point, and our line is protected by a belt of barbed wire thirty feet thick. So I feel pretty comfortable.<br/>25/6/16<br/>A quiet Day. I saw 10 of our aeroplanes up at once. They attacked the enemy observation balloons with patent bombs and burnt four of them. There is an airman on this front, popularly know as the "Mad Major", he seems to be the last word in fearlessness.</p>
