  
 concert at night. Sometimes the Nurses & Doctors are invited while other times we make a "Smoko" for men only. 
 We have a lot of arguments with the A.M.C. [Australian Medical Corps] staff & there seemed to be serious trouble brewing. Everything has been patched up now & we are the very best of friends. 
 Last night we had an open air concert on the Fore-deck just under the Bridge. About 50 men sat & sang all the songs that they knew. The Nurses & some of the Officers were seated on the steps & along the Promenade Deck.
