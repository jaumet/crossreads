<p>At it again this morning. We are hard at it, shovelling sand and filling sand bags. The sun is very warm, we strip to the waist for the sake of more freedom.</p>
<p>Sand work is a great trial on the temper. You work hard for an hour &amp; throw out a huge heap of sand only to have it all tumble in again, half burying you. It gives you free play for pure Australian language. All the same we are making good headway.</p>
<p>Got a parcel from the mater &amp; it was most welcome. I was feeling a bit down on it &amp; it cheered me up.</p>
