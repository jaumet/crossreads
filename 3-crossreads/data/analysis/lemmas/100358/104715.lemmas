 was present with a print copi from Miss Ethel M. Campbel , who may have been the Authoress . Australian . Dedic to some of the " elit " of Durban after hear their opinion of the Australian " We are not cotton spinner all , but some love England her honour yet " We stand on the shore of Durban And watch the transport go , To England from Australia , Hurri to fro , Bear the men of a nation - Who are hero to the core ? To stand or fall by the Motherland , And they are send thousand more . We ve watch the ship return With the crippl and the maim , With limb that trail and falter ? Their an immort name ! The deathless name of " Anzac " That thrill from pole to pole , The remnant of the hero Of the long and glorious Roll . And now in their ten of hundr , Come the men to fill their rank , And what can we do to show them Our love , our pride , our thank ? We cant do much ( I own it ) , But give them a pass cheer - While the real elit beat a shock retreat - Whi , they saw one drink beer ! Oh , God , could we show these miser The path that the Anzac went ! Could they rest in their bed at night time ? Or live in their damn content ? Could they talk with a sneer of Australian When one or two got drunk ? I?d rather a drunk Australian Than a wealthi Durban funk ! He 's a better man than you are , You dear teatot saint ! You do not drink , you will not fight ! What wonder restraint ! We stand on the shore of Durban , For we re not all made like you , And the glorious name of " Anzac " Thrill us thro ? and thro ? ! But all we can do is cheer them , And throw them a trifl on shore ? We are not millionair ( like some are ) , Or perhap we would tri to do more .
