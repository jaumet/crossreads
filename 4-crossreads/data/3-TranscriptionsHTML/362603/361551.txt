<p>2.  guess that there is some more work looking after the pony &amp; washing the sulky, cleaning harness etc.<br/>I do not know whether Reg. wants Mrs Ella to know about His work or not.  But Reg. has been to France &amp; wounded again since then.  I have a letter here from Him now.  Ellis has just written to Him.  I will probably run down to see Him in a couple of week's time.  He is at Exeter &amp; His Relatives from Somerset have motored over to see Him.  He is doing well He tells us, so His good People need not worry.<br/>We have hundreds of German prisoners working round the Camp &amp; making new roads &amp; repairing old ones.<br/>I guess You will be proud wearing Your silver medal.  I knew You would have to let us go to the War some day.  I wanted to go from the start. I might have an officer &amp; a true soldier if You had let me go then, but anyway we are here to do what the army tells us to do &amp; have no picking our Jobs.<br/>Well, Mum &amp; Dad &amp; George, We are all well &amp; we trust that You are the same.  This is one of our worst months &amp; we've not had a bad day yet.  We have had one poor sort of a fog &amp; about 5 frosty mornings.<br/>I must go &amp; see the Barber now &amp; get ready to go to the Theatre.  My Salisbury Friends received Your nice letter, Mum.  I am going in to see them to-morrow, D.V.<br/>I will go by Train I think.  It is getting cold on the fingers &amp; toes riding the Bike.<br/>Fondest Love to You all.<br/>From Harry.</p>
