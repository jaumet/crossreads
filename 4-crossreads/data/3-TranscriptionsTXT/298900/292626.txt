Tuesday 5th Feb '18   Caught a cold most probably through my bath & felt rather heavy all day.   Took a stroll in the afternoon up to Kemmel Hill, the highest point of the district & a very valuable observation post of ours before the Messines Advance.   'Tis honeycombed with trenches dugouts & tunnels with machine gun possies all strongly built with steel & cement.  Had a good view of the surrounding country but it being hazy it could have been better.
Wednesday 6th Feb    Had a quiet day and did a little writing also prepared a requisition for stores to be drawn tomorrow.  Had some music at nigh with piano in mess.   Weather beautiful.   A.D.M.S. inspected the place and was very pleased.
Thursday 7th Feb   Nothing much doing.   Sent my offsider to collect the stores.  Had an evening in the Mess, good fun, singing, piano yarning etc.   Bed about one, feeling O.K. although I had a cold.  Very cold wind blowing all day.
