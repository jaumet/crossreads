<p>1916<br/>December<br/>between 3 and 4 pm when accompanied by a guide.   So we turned about off to the town again.   There is a moat all round the castle.  The Castle figures rather prominently in early South African history and, I believe, is well worth going over.  I got some strawberries (they were very cheap here and at Durban &ndash; 2 lbs for 1/-), and the others got pears and things.   I forgot to mention the City Hall.  It is next the Market Square.  It is a big long building, but looks a very dirty white color when you get close.   We now came to the best part of Cape Town ie the Pier.  It is at the end of the main street and juts into Table Bay.  It is made of concrete and is a very fine piece of work.  Picture of it [there follows a sketch of the area in Capetown described by the author.   Rider added "NB copied from picture drawn on Port Napier".]</p>
