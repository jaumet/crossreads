concentration of our artillery fire on their line is terrible to see. It looks to me as though they are altering the shape of the land.I had a bitter taste in my mouth this morning. We all heard this confounded gun bark which is worrying us shortly after heard the approach of the shell, gee it was a bonser, br-r-r-r bang. It seemed to pass over our heads landed in Senlis just in front of us. Blew up 2 houses did anyth everything but do any military damage. They fired 2 more of these, one of which did not burst, but they are some lot I tell you.Artillery Batteries are galloping by going into action. They are practically jammed wheel on wheel so imagine the racket they create.I had a letter from Clabby who is in England with the 3rd Division we will all be pleased when they arrive here, as it will no doubt mean a longer spell for us out of the Front Line.I think something is in the wind here, as Cavalry to the number of 45 000 is concentrating in rear of the Australians ready for a quick dash through.Old permanent Imperial Artillerymen who have fought at Mons, Ypres Arras, say they never heard anything in their life like this continuous bombardment.Men are coming out of the pits utterly insane white after 48 hours of it, so imagine what it is like.
