<p>My dear all,<br/> You will see by the above address that I am on 12 days leave with Aunt Annie. I left Bulford last Friday and on the same morning  we received a number of letters from home. From Mother 9/11/18, 15/11/18, 1/12/18, 2/12/18, 21/12/18, 29/12/18 from Dad 1/12/18, 14/12/18, 21/12/18, 29/12/18, which I have now with me and have read them to Marie and Aunt. They are delighted to know you are all so well, so now I shall answer your questions starting with Mother.<br/>By jove you did give the pony a try out 42 miles to [indecipherable] no wonder you could not sit down for awhile, and so sorry to hear poor Mrs Whitehouse is so bad but I am sorry to say she will never be well again poor soul we  are sorry, and George Miller has arrived home</p>
