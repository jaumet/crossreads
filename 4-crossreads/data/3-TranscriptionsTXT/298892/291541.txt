Still we all have a pretty good idea and I don't think I am far wrong when I say that I will probably be able to visit some of father's people when we arrive at our destination. I have sent some cards and letters at each port of call and trust you have received them safely. I am in perfect health and have not had a day's illness since leaving Sydney. We encountered a lot of whalers after leaving port yesterday but did not sight any whales. I would like to write to the Sharpes but have not their address. I searched through all my books but cannot find it. As letters must be in by to-night I must now close with best love to all. Your loving son Eugene. 
 Address:- No.1515 Pte. Eugene Sullivan A.M.C. Head Quarter's Staff, 33 Battalion, 9th Brigade, A.I.F. Abroad.
