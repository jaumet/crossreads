One on starboard side has 2 lighthouses &amp;  about 3 signalling stations. No trees or grass &amp;  no jetty or wharf. Travelled 295 miles. Natives came over to us from the shore selling tobacco, preserved fruit, post cards etc. Fired a blank off to frighten them away. A  S.M. threw some water over them &amp;  nearly got thrown overboard for doing it. The place itself is placed near the shore &amp;  behind are the big rocky mountains. A clock is placed on a hill  in the  town &amp;  has only its [indecipherable]. Quite lonely it looks. It isn't lit up at night either. A very good search light is used by the garrison stationed there. Have a headache &amp;  sore chest.
