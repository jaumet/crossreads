<p>Feby 1917<br/>6th/9th On 8th about 8.30 am brigade moved off from Mazar &amp; arrived at Bardawil (Kilo 139) about 4pm. Scored a horse off Geo Crawford &amp; rode all way. Result was I got in early &amp; when camels arrived no time lost in unloading &amp; I scored in the line of wood for fire. Travelled along old Caravan route which is very close to coast &amp; branches on to beach at K139. Wild daisies &amp; poppies growing on side of route &amp; country seemed more fertile as natural grasses showed an appearance here &amp; there but very poor. Horses got small grouters on old camp sites, oats &amp; wheat sprouting. They also got fresh water at night &amp; its only a tale they did not relish it. Some were off colour from dry feed &amp; brackish water<br/>Feby 1917<br/>9th &ndash; Moved off again about 9.30 am &amp; arrived at Masaid about midday. Only a six m. stunt. Tents &amp; camp pitched in hods. Hods fairly plentiful <strike>frequent</strike> near El Arish. Aeroplane likes birds, up all day. Journey made along beach, beach very wide in places two mles of sand. No hostile planes yet sighted on this stunt but expected daily. Believe or expect to be bombed any day. Rumoured 1st L.H.B. bombed on AM of 7th. Various reports as to casualties but believe one horse hit or killed. Camp at Masaid within a mile of sea &amp; surf bathing rushed. No time to visit it yet. Capt Simpson to 12th. Wonder what the next shuffle will bring forth? Every one</p>
