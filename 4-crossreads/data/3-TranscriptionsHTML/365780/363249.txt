<p>untill their painful breath at last began to fail<br/>Upon there way to death let pity draw the veil<br/>They would not mind the blow but cut of sound &amp; sight<br/>Of comrades [indecipherable] fire they passed to endless night<br/>Deep down on Oceans floor far from the wind &amp; sun<br/>They rest for ever more.
