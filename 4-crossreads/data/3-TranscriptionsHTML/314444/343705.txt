<p>4th August 1916.<br/>France.</p>
<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Have not had anytime to write lately, I am fit &amp; well &amp; feeling tip top.<br/>Have had a strenuous ten days, but have scraped through alright. Met Lloyd Davies yesterday. He has just joined his battalion. Also saw Cecil Christmas yesterday They are both well. Remember me to all friends &amp; tell them we have absolutely no time to write while this big advance is on. We are doing well. Best wishes &amp; good luck. Cheer up<br/>Your loving son<br/>Tom.</p>
