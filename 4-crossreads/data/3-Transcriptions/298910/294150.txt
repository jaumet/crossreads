<p>they said, we will never hold it, as you are out too <u>bleeding far</u>. We went back about to the Reserves about midnight.</p>
<p>Sunday  12/5/17</p>
<p>Very hot &ndash; We were relieved by 8th &amp; 14th F. Amb. &ndash; went back to Main Dressing Station about two miles from Bapaume, where we arrived at midday &ndash; got a square feed &amp; plenty of hot tea. Had a bit of a clean up &ndash; shave &amp; an apology for a Bath. I got another crack on the shoulder coming out but it didn't hurt nor cut the flesh &ndash; I really do not think Fritz will knock me now &ndash; Without a doubt as the Doctors all say my case is another one in favour of the steel lids &ndash; undoubtedly they proved friendly to me &amp; in future will never treat them with such contempt. I must admit my nut was fairly sore last night &amp; all day today &ndash; It is healing fast &amp; I had a dose of Anti Tet &ndash; S &ndash; I forgot all about my little grievances when I found 9 letters awaiting me from Mrs Hill, Annie, May, Mrs Single, Gert Nock, Kit, Lill &amp; Les hagan &ndash; it was great to get such news from good old pals. Gas alarm at night. Had a good sleep &amp; pleasant dreams after the nice letters.</p>
