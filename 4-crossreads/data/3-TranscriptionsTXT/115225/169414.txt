Jan 10th  The rain chased me off the deck at 2.A.M. but it cleared up at 10 A.M. & the rest of the day was beautiful - we kept in sight of land all day - read all day & played euchre in the evening.
 
Jan 11th  We were out of sight of land for a few hours, but came in sight again at about 4.30 P.M. We played crib in the evening. We slept on deck but it wasn't too good, it was windy & cold.
 
Jan 12th  We got into Cape Town first thing. all the troops went ashore at 12.30 except a fatigue party (& I made one) who were kept on board to load stores & worked like horses till 7.30 P.M. with the promise that we should go ashore the following day - We went ashore after we had finished our work & had a hot bath & a feed & went aboard again at 10.30 P.M.  We shipped a gun & gun crew -
 
Jan 13th  We pulled out into the bay at 7 A.M. & dropped anchor - we were not allowed ashore as promised, and it was a lovely day wasted.
 
Jan 14th  Sunday & we spent a lazy day laying about all day - lovely day.
