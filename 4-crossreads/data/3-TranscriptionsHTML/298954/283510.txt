<p>Fri 17th Aug. (cont.)<br/>When the hullabaloo on deck had quietened a little, "Little Willie" and and escort bravely ventured down amongst us (flourishing revolvers) and marshalled each ship's crew in turn up under the poop-deck.</p>
<p>Ober-Leutnant Rose was supporting himself against a bulkhead quite drunk, giggling foolishly and waving a revolver at us.</p>
<p>There were some funny little incidents &ndash; Capt. Wickman ("Jumna") thought that deliverance or mutiny was at hand and appeared in a gorgeous, much-creased uniform with about five rings and a curl which had not hitherto seen the light since his capture.</p>
<p>He intended to either save or die in his glittering gold braid.</p>
<p>A favourable pastime on board is stealing food from the captured ship's stores as it comes on board.</p>
