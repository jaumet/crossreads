 [Transcriber's Note:  The letters are mainly to his mother, father, sister and brothers written from March 1915 to November 1916 and cover his voyage to Egypt, his time in Egypt and also at Anzac Cove.  From there he went to Lemnos Island and on to France where he arrived in March 1916.  Because of censorship he is unable to describe in detail in his letters just where he is in Belgium and France but he gives a general description of his life on the battlefields.  He was granted leave from 27 September 1916 to 10 October 1916 and visited London, Birmingham and Eastbourne.  Also included are letters of condolence to Mr. and Mrs. Richards following his death.  He kept a diary from 15 August 1915 to 17 November 1916 which gives more details of his experiences.  He was wounded on 6 November 1916 in France and was taken to Southmead Hospital, Bristol, England where he died on 26 November 1916 following an operation to remove shrapnel from his lung.]
