 My darling Eddy, We have started a garden around our Mess Tent (dining-room). We got some roots from a ruined village near by. the weather is so nice now, that we can do a little gardening. the Padre's (ministers) like to do the digging so we all work hard. We want a little boy like you to help in the garden. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses   &amp;  a big hug. XOXXOXOXOX From OOOX  Auntie Eadle
