not descriptive enough to describe it. Town nestling amongst groves of palms, bananas etc. Saw Mt. Adams Peak in the distance. Coast very low lying verdant. Left after two days had another fortnights stretch till Fremantle. Had a fancy dress Ball. Goodo. All kinds of characters. Coming into Fremantle Harbour crowds on wharf cooeeing, etc. Something more I can't describe the thrill of something which passed through me again again as I hoorayed gazed on the gesticulating people land which God granted me to see again or fate luck whichever.
