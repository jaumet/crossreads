A short biography of each service person is given at the beginning of each set of letters, with information coming mainly from State Library of NSW catalogue entries, and records available on the websites of Australian War Memorial (World War 1 Embarkation and Nominal Rolls) and National Archives of Australia (World War 1 Service Records). Information about the content of letters and the letter donors is sometimes given. "Return to Australia" dates are generally the date the service person embarked in England; arrival in Australia would be six to eight weeks later. Some paragraph and line breaks have been introduced in the transcription for ease of reading.]
