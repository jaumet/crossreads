25/2/12 Boulogne Selles
The Battalion was to have gone up to Carlettes to carry out a gas attack practice but dawn showed heavy rain falling. So the scheme was postponed and a programme of indoor work was carried out. Rode out to Quesques and saw the dentist. From here across to the 4th Army range through Lottinghen and looked up Gorman & Greene who are billeted here with our demonstration platoon. The farm people seem miserably poor and sullen. An old man crouching over a fire and a tired looking woman. Stayed here for a while and had lunch with the officers. Then rode across to Bde.H.Q and fixed up a number of details regarding competitions. From
