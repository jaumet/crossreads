A very good recreation room and wet and dry canteen is here, also library.   We get war news daily by wireless and I fancy we get news before the papers.    My course is going to take a month.    The wireless course takes 3 months.

We got a complete change of underclothes    Hazebrouk is a fine City but as usual we saw little of it.   This afternoon on jointings and buzzer again.   Wrote home.
