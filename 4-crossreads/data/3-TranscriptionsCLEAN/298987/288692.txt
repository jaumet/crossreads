  
 After a bit of messing around to Headquarters Etc we got Tea consecting of 2 slices of bread each margarine & Blancmange & Tea. We only had Mess tins or clash brunes so Blancmange was rather slipery stuff to handle but it did not go to waste Were issued with 3 blankets & allotted to tents with board floors Kitbags were left at the railway 
 Sunday 26th Not the bright England of yesterday heavy clouds & showers all day. This camp is on a gentle slope - one side of a valey the opposite side was abruptly for fully 300 ft. On the side of this hill there are quite a collection of Regimental Badges & designs made by cutting away the turf & exposeing the clean white chalk that is only covered by a few inches of soil. An immense "Rising Sun" is cut out opposite here - very well done. A outline of Australia & a Kangaroo further up
