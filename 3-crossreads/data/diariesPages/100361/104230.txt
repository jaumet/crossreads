Sun. Apr. 14th
War news look a bit bright and this morning we are holding Fritz back, but the casualties on both sides must be enormous.
George Lawson, the Billiard marker, finished up at his job today, had a few words with the "Food Controller". He and I went into Warminster after Dinner. The Depot Band was playing at the Town Hall, and tho? it was bitterly cold a good crowd gathered to listen to the Music. We had some Biscuits and Tea at the new "Y.M." went for a stroll and had some more Tea and Sandwiches at the Town Hall.
Then we went to the Methodist Church. It was quite homely and I enjoyed it much better than "the Minster" services.
Sun 14 (cont)
After the Service we attended a Sing-Song in the School-Room. I met Sgt Matheson there.
A number of Ladies were present and handed round Tea and Cakes. They gave us an invitation to attend a Social on Tuesday night, but I won't be able to go as I shall be working.
Returned to Camp about 9.30.
