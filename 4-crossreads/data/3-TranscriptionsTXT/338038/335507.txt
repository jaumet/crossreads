 38th Battery Australian Field Artillery France   11/7/18 
 Dear Mr Garling, Will you accept my very deepest sympathy about poor old Terry.  As a "brother" battery commander &ndash; he had the 37th - &amp; I the 38th  - I would like to express my admiration of him &amp; to say how much I personally miss him.  I think it is safe to say, he was the most popular chap in the Brigade &amp; as for his Battery well they just worshipped him.
