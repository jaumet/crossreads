<p>in the night &ndash; we will be nearly &ndash; if not the last.  Well Mother I have been in some pretty tight corners since this campaign started but his beats all.  Between the devil and the deep blue sea if you like &ndash; I'm glad Percy did not come over &ndash; We may get off without a shot at us &ndash; covered by the gun boats, but we may not.</p>
<p>If we get cut up, you wont see this so it wont make any difference.</p>
<p>We are packed up, about 15 lbs of clothes 200 rounds of ammunition, a bag of porridge (which we pinched off the transport carts one dark night) &ndash; 2 blankets a waterproof overcoat &ndash; and all but rifle &amp; ammunition will go &ndash; if it gets hot., a kit can be picked up anywhere, but a skin cant.</p>
<p>Half our supply of stores has to be thrown away, &amp; I don't think I can take my sniping rifle, that hurts, she's a daisy, she knocked a periscope at 1000 yds today, you can imagine they don't show their heads much.  That's about all Mother &ndash; we are sitting in our snipers dug out &ndash; where a Turk will be in a day or two (That was on the 16th &ndash; they did not leave till the 19th Dec)</p>
