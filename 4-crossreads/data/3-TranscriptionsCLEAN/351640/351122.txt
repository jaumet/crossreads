  
 have it republished and send to me a copy. For two or three days we have been expecting correspondence from Australia. A mail was delivered at Suez from a P. & O. steamer on Monday, but the delivery has not been made to us yet. It is a shame. Yet it is to be expected, because the chiefs here are trying to run a great war on the lines of peace, and unless they wake up to the fact soon that great contests are not  successfully  brought to successfull issue in that way they will wake up to the fact that those playing the parts of laggards are receiving a sound thrashing. The whole affair is becoming too serious for words, and I fear me that the awakening is becoming perilously close. The waste in time men & material here is something appaling, in every department. 
 Polo golf cricket and the like are of great use in times of peace but shooting drilling riding bayonet exercise and such preparation for fighting are the desiderata in times of war; those men who know best how to use the weapons of destruction placed in their hands and those leaders who know most about the art & science of the game, will be the winners in the end. There is no royal road to the knowledge in this great game, than there is in other the affairs of life, and it is only by constant work and application that an individual or a nation can be in the first flight. Let us hope that inspiration will soon come and that leaders with the rank & file will give of their best constantly to reach the required result.
