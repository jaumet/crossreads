<p>Bayonet Trench Flers 22/11/16  Midnight came and we kept finding men shorter.  Some poor devils were absolutely done and had to be dug out by<br/>our chaps.  Others were barefooted having lost their boots and four were gathered up wandering round No Mans Land.  A hell of a mix up. About 1 p.m. we reported "relief complete" and were just moving off when we found a Lewis gun crew not in position &ndash; the men utterly exhausted were lying round in the mud inert and helpless.  Arranged to have them left in reserve.  Pushed off about 1am through a little barrage the sap was like glue and I had fallen down and commenced panting before reaching the terrace.  We went like hell past the tank to avoid the fate of the many dead men lying round it and I was slipping and sliding and cursing and so physically done up that I was struggling like a drunk.  Reaching a place a little further off we eased up and only had a few shells round us.  There was a fog and we soon lost our bearings in spite of our expert guides.  Compass was useless and there were no landmarks.  Going Heavy.  After much wandering we struck a tram line a long distance out of our way and plodded along it.  The fellows soon commenced to knock up and fall out but I did not mind as they could easily come on along the rails later.  The shells landed close round us and fortunately the wet ground caused many duds.  It saved our lives.  Reaching one secluded spot I gave permission to smoke and instantly regretted it for they turned a battery on to us.<br/>The wet ground again caused duds and saved us.  The road seemed never ending and we were all just about done when we struck Delville Wood and the road.  The latter was awash with about 6 inches of cementy mud through which we waded getting soaked all over with it.  We turned into where we thought our camp was but could find nothing owing to the mist and we wandered round miserably until dead beat and done.  The sound of chaps lost calling out came from all roads.  What a filthy exhausting life.  It ended up in us all tired and worn with fighting dropping down exhausted in the mud and lying there in a frost until dawn had come.  It came still with a blanket</p>
