The bath were open today till 12 , then the girl "knock off " but we had to clean up befor we finish . Had a jolli good dinner . Roast beef , potato and arrowroot . Red Cross comfort arriv I drew a shirt and pkt . of envelop but swap with Arthur Butler for a pipe . Mile " Sheehan and a number of other from Fort Rompu came in for a bath stay to dinner and had a most enjoy time . Mac Mile and I went into Armentier " after dinner ( on the way in we met Bluey Stanton , who introduc us to a farmhous where we got a good glass of beer . ) It is a fine big town , but is bad knock about by shell fire . Part of the town are absolut in ruin . We saw 3 church that were wreck , blown to piec . In one of them an enorm bell had fallen from the tower and was almost buri . Whole street of hous were pile up one on top of the other . We went into sever cottag and they were just as the peopl had left them , dure the bombard . Book and trinket lie around , push cart , pictur on the wall , articl of apparel and all manner of thing . In one cottag , which was an entir wreck in the centr of an upstair room , was a small wicker tabl and on it was a small vase , with dead flower in it . It was about the onli thing about the place that was intact , so I put it in my pocket and if I can will send it home . There are still thousand of peopl live there although it is bombard everi day . We went into a place and had a feed of egg and chip potato . Half way through our meal the shell commenc to burst quit near and Mdlle . came in and said " Messieur , , when you finish , I close up and go to the cellar . Plenti big shell .
