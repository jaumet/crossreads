All this will soon be altered, of course as it will not be long before sunset will bring a darkened ship and silence. The two nights referred to above, these conditions were enforced but only the officers concerned knew for what reason. As we were in the vicinity of several islands during this period, the general opinion is that the object of these precautions was to keep the ships whereabouts as secret as possible.The last few remarks brings one to another practice &ndash; "Boat Stations" a most important one now-a-days. Every unit is alotted to a certain portion of the ship, and to certain boat and raft stations, which they are to immediately take up on the "Boat Station" signal being given by the ship's whistle.

It is to be hoped that we are not called upon to face the "stern reality" as although the chances of everyone on board being saved are good, it would be a pity if such a fine ship as this was sent to the bottom.
