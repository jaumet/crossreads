  
 Next we passed an English family ship homeward bound with happy tourists with their wives & kiddies crowded along the gang ways waving and shouting. 
 An obsolete French destroyer next passed us looking like nothing on water. 
 The grand statue of De Lesseps we passed on our starboard side & I think everybody endeavoured to get a snapshot of it. Cameras were everywhere to be seen on the boat deck. 
 About 10 minutes previous a tug came out to meet us and let the pilot on board.  The pilot appears to be the only man worth a cent when a ship reaches port.
