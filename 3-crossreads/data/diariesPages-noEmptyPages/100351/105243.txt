Very tired this a.m. after yesterday. At 11 p.m. "Stand Down" there started the fiercest shell I have yet been under. Shrapnel, High Explosives of all Calibres dropped all around us. We knew that if our Dug-out was struck we would be buried alive beneath the solid steel roof & we also knew that roof not shell-proof only shrapnel & pellet proof. For 2 hrs. both sides kept Hell open & we feared greatly. The ground shook with the vibrations & so did my knees. Secty Gen L. Cpl & 4 others of our section retd. to-night from Bombing School. 2 of them
