<p>We were at a Mosque &amp; some Coptic churches. One of the churches is built over a cave where it is said the Virgin Mary, Jesus, &amp; St Joseph rested during their journey from the land of Herod to Heliopolis. All the buildings are tawdry, 'mongst slums of the worst order, all the decorations and the paintings are of historical value only. I asked the attendants to sell me some of the wood work, but each said that money could not buy them Their value too is historical and not artistic. Neither of the men knows Cairo, each was lost in wonder at the city, the river, the streets, the buildings, the dirt, <strike>and</strike> the people, and their ways.</p>
<p>Good night. More anon.</p>
<p>3-11-15. Enclosed you will find a cutting from the Egyptian Gazette. The matter was I thought rather well put. What think you.</p>
<p>Another paragraph <strike>told</strike> narrated how an article intended for publication, was submitted for censorship, it contained the Kipling line, "the captains and the kings depart", as a quotation. The gentleman who cut out the three words "and the kings", has explained that he did so because in the article submitted no mention was made of the presence of any kings therefore the words must be wrong.</p>
<p>Another hero has altered Browning. "The Times tells that in an account of the fighting at Hulluch which it submitted to the Censor were quoted Browning's lines:-<br/>Twenty-nine distinct damnations<br/>One sure if the other fails"<br/>When the despatch came back the only material alteration was that the words "twenty-nine distinct" were ruled out, and replaced by the one word "different". Wise censors. Bai Jove!!!</p>
