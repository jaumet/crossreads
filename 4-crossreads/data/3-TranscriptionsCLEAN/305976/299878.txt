NCOs drawn from other units who have seen service. Very hot day. & beautiful moonlight night. On duty all night, naturally wonder on such nights as these how all are getting on at home What a change a few months can make in a man's life. Tuesday July 3 Our first Sand storm. Windy as              sand in everything including Food "What a lovely country" EGYPT Wednesday July 4 W.O. arrived today from 3rd Light Horse Field Amb Seems a good sort.
