<p>22/2/16<br/>The battalion was broken up and every second man was sent to a new Battalion  ours went to the 58 Bt The idiar was to git some men that had been under fire mixed up with the new men  it was not a happy parting because they took half of the old men out of what was left of them   it was my luck to stay behind</p>
