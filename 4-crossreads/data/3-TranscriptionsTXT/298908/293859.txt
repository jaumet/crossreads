chaps had to leave their positions & go & fight for such curs as these & now its all over they don't care what becomes of the fighting men, while all this was going on the car was of course hung up & a big crowd was collecting.

"I know you will lads he cried" for you know what these mongrels are" & he was quite right for they are a rotten bad looking lot these shirkers & pacificists & have earnt all the big moneys while other lads have been fighting for them & here was a bright specimen who wouldn't even give his place on the car for a sailor with a big load.  At any rate the sailor won & off the chap went with the mails.  I wouldn't have cared to have been in that dockyardies shoes
