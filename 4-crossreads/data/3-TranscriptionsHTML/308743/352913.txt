<p>27 January 1915<br/>Wednesday 24 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Stables at 6<br/>First parade was telephones for the Troop along the canal, the Boss was out on his bike capturing men up trees etc! Motor bikes were passed for repair at last. At ten this morning I got an answer to my cable from home it seems that the money has been sent &amp; now only has to be collected. The gram was two days late having laid in the LA office for that time. The team is to move on Saturday to Luton loading to be done on Friday. Wind has been high all day and indications of rain is now noticeable but will as usual pass off.<br/>The CO failed to recommend Toby's application until [indecipherable] got on to his lug &amp; now has changed his mind we have put in another from home through the High Commissioner of Australia. Leave stopped for two days on account of a Mohammad [indecipherable] Bed at 9</p>
<p>28 January 1915<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Stables at 6<br/>At first parade the men were out on telephone work, the L.H. were on advanced station work. I got a letter from the bank saying that the money had been sent &amp; only wanted collecting, so I am to go on leave tomorrow &amp; procure it &amp; also a notice for a parcel at Mena<br/>We sent our second application away today &amp; if we have any luck in three weeks time should hear from London. All preparations are made for move on Saturday &amp; most of the stores have already left. We heard that the New Zealanders had had a touch with the enemy &amp; had returned, but don't know how true it is [indecipherable] day has come round at last and once again I'm flush if if only for a few hours. Bed 10pm</p>
