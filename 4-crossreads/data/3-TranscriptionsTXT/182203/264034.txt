 I made a list, so trust I have remembered everyone.  The seven sick sisters left here yesterday for Australia. Sisters Craig, Bolton and Ralston were my friends. I also knew Sister Andrews fairly well. Sister Ricketts has gone back on transport and she has taken a letter to you from me to be posted in Melbourne.  Dorothy saw one of Mrs Bastell's boys   go  leaving by the same boat, so he may leave our parcels with Mr Tom Newton &ndash; anyhow they will let you know. I felt a bit homesick when I saw them leaving but since seeing Constance Murray and hearing you are all well I feel more satisfied.  Fondest love &amp; kisses. Hope you will all keep well &amp; have a happy Xmas.
