<p>Moascoar Camp, Ismailia<br/>Monday 29/5/16<br/>Very soon settled down to work; marched to Nefiche Station during morning &amp; again in the afternoon with our packs up.  Nefiche is the junction of the Suez, Cairo &amp; Port Said lines, about 2 miles from where we are at present camping.  Soon found my way to the Lake at Ismailia for a swim &amp; afterwards endeavoured to gain admission to the aerodrome.  Was successful in passing the guard, but as soon as our presence was discovered inside we were very soon put out.</p>
