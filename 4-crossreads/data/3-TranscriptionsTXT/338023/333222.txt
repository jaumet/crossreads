 My Dear Aunt I received your welcome letter and  was very glad to hear from you. I am with Erick over here I met him as soon as he came back from hospital. He is as well as ever again and we are leaving for France together on Saturday. He was slightly wounded in the [thigh?] it was a very nasty wound but only in the flesh so it healed very quick and dose'nt effect him at all. Aunt you asked me to go and see Mrs Horton but Aunt I did'nt get a chance this time but I will most likely see London again before the war is over and will go and see her then. I am very sorry I didn't see you &amp; Betty before I left but I will see you both when I come back. Well Aunt the weather is getting very cold here now so we are just leaving in a bad time. Aunt I will have to close short note as I have a lot of letters to write on account of going away. Well Aunt I will write again as soon as I get settled down in France. Give my love to Betty. Erick sends his love to you and Betty. Love and best wishes from Jim X X PS Excuse writing &amp; pencil as I am in a hurry  as you can guess we have a lot to do X X
