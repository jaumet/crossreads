Hundreds - no, - thousands - watched us being carried, pushed, or helped into the waiting motor-waggons.
When we were all inside these the canvas flaps were dropped and we rattled away along a cobbled road.
Cobbles!  with iron tyres!   Ugh!    Our drive was in a circle;  we returned to the water-front again on entering the gates of the big naval hospital.
We were taken to portable papier-mache barracks erected in the hospital grounds, some 16 patients to a hut.
In our hut are Cuthill, John, the Jap. 3rd officer and Nagayama, and some niggers.
A  continuous procession files in to look at the latter, niggers being apparently scarce in Germany.
