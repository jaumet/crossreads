<p>Friday 7 December 1917.</p>
<p><s>Rations came up at dawn &amp; were issued</s>.</p>
<p>Nothing doing today until a party of us were detailed to go back to Julis for rations at dark.</p>
<p>It rained &amp;&nbsp;we were working in mud up to our knees. A fair nightmare altogether.</p>
<p>We were that cold &amp; wet that the Lt. QM. gave us brandy to warm &amp; sort of revive us as we were just about frozen &amp; near collapse.</p>
<p>The camels sent to &quot;our relief&quot; brought in the rations.</p>
<p>This was the roughest nights&#39; spin I have had yet &amp; ever hope to have.</p>
<p>Got back at 3 am.to rest of unit who had moved 1 mile and then gave up trying to move further tonight. Lay down by a fire we built up to warm ourselves --&gt;</p>
