Tonight I had a rather exciting ride with the Horse that had been alotted to me.  She is a fine big Mare, about 16 hands high & takes some getting into the saddle. However , to night when I got into the saddle she took it into her head to buck & had me all over the place in two [indecipherable].  I managed to stick to her, & galloped up & down the Racecourse a few times which quietened her. After this I rode round through Zeitoun Matarieh & Pont De Koubbeh & am very dissatisfied with her, so I am taking back my old horse to-morrow & will stick to him if possible. 
 19.4.16 Wednesday We held our first dismounted 4th  Divisional Train Parade to-day & it was very good to see.  We went through a few movements, were inspected & dismissed
