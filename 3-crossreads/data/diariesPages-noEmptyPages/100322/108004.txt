Marcinelle
Church parade after which an Archdeacon from Lincoln gave a lecture on Industrial Unrest. Had the pleasure of rousing Gorman up because this parade was late. A lovely Spring day today. Took a promenade after lunch and after evening mess visited the town. Quiet.

Snowing all the morning and raining hard all the afternoon. Tried a couple of cases at Orderly Room and was reasonably busy up until lunch time. After lunch read and wrote before going up the town. Bought a guide book to the Rhine and another to Switzerland and was home at 5.30 for mess.
