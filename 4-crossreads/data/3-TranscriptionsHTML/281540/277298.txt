<p>4/12/15<br/>After lunch crossed bridge and passed old overgrown graveyard surrounding old Greek church.  Went in and found old women sweeping out.  Rudely built in front with large beams as rafters.  Inside large candles and chandeliers with glass pendants like the old church at Vieux Cairo   Paintings on the wall and tapestries of silk with images of sacred people let in, the needle work joining up alround them.  On desk old looking missal and bible.  The small altar in a sort of inner shrine.  Old crone hovering round saying "Christo! Christo!".</p>
<p>In the street saw the Greek padres in their black robes and hats telling their beads.  Long hair done up in a topknot at the back and flowing beards.  The girls and children in the street  beautiful in face and figure.  Went to old shop with clean looking old owner and bought some tinned fruit and honey.  Small boy interpreted.  Squad of Tommies marching through invaded place &amp; there was much vociferention and bargaining until they were disposed of.</p>
<p>Back along street into other shop  where old rogue presides bought case of Black &amp; White whisky for &pound; 4 and paid in notes and one sovereign.  The sight of the latter nearly sent him mad  "By God, I love it" and eventually to get the gold he knocked off the odd money &amp; arranged the loading of the mule.  All this extra for one little sovereign!   A good instance of depreciation of an inconvertible paper currency.  The Greeks will accept a sovereign in payment for a purchase of 24/- which otherwise  would have to be paid for in a &pound;1 note and 4/- of silver.  Loading the mules a great business watched</p>
