<p>Flaville. The day was bitterly cold &amp; the wind cut right through our bodies. When we arrived we had to set too &amp; build our own dugouts, during our building operations we were shelled by Fritz from time to time.</p>

In the afternoon one of the enemys aroplanes came over &amp; destroyed two more of our Observation balloons, the Ocupants reached the ground by means of the parachute without injury . Our Anti &ndash;Aircraft guns succeeded in bringing the enemy plane down.
