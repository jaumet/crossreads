  
 8/2/16 Col Norris has not taken over routine yet. Did some semaphore at early parade.  Morning rode round trenches and measured our traverses for Engineers work. Then rode out over sand hills. Afternoon did Advanced Guards and had a platoon out scattered as enemy. Routine office stuff not many furpheys. All quiet and myself feeling rather fed up with this dam seniority business. Talk about the inertia it is the father of. 
 9/2/16 Roused like a fury at reveille over slackness and caused quite a flutter in one or two quarters. Round engineers in trenches and had a look at the bivouacs in continuation of the company lines. Being half holiday after lunch there was a good scrap between Rhoden and Harwood both dyed crimson on their bare skins with the gore from eyes and noses, "Sailor" Parsons and "Storeman" Stevens was a put up job and declared no fight. 
 Writing most of the afternoon and then to a conference of officers presided over by C.O.  The Brigadier was present and we settled a few tactical phases. A hostile mounted patrol has been reported. The weather today cold and some rain making conditions generally favourable to an advance across the desert. Resiting some of our trenches to get a field of fire on the forward slope for if the enemy have no heavy guns. Bed early.
