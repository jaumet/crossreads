  
 While I write Major Grey (Dr.) and other young bloods, are moving about each wearing on his head some trophy given up by a bon-bon or a box, reminding me of post dinner scenes oft happening under our own roof at anterior celebrations of the same annual feast.  You may fancy how grand the gallant fat Major looks wearing the trophies upon his head his shoulders and his manly chest.  Flaged sticks, have the women folk, besides rosettes caps capes and a' that.  Good luck to each!  May every Christmas day that comes to all be merry as is this for them beneath the tropic sky upon the bosom of the Indian Ocean. 
 At 8 p.m. I read the rosary and the litany of the B.V.M. for the Catholics who assembled in the lecture room.  No officers attended, one nurse was present, and about twenty men.  The officers & other nurses were at dinner.  The dinner passed off pleasantly.  I was rather an odd number owing to my being late.  This was advantageous as it allowed me to be a listener to the merry chatter & the rippling laughter which flowed from all at table.  Some of those near spoke to me but I did not encourage them, preferring that each Sister should keep on talking with the other officers.  There were some toasts, but no words that could be entitled a speech. 
 From off the Christmas cake were taken for me some tokens and leaves, enclosed are samples, which let me hope will reach you in good state. Good night!  Good night!!!  Good night!!!!
