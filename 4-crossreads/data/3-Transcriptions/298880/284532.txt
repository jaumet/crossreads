<p>Sept 2nd.</p>
<p>We did station work today (or were supposed to) to finish up our course. I went about 10 miles out near Fort Rouge with another chap. We didn't do a tap all day as there was no sun and we were too far away to be seen with the flags. It was the first time I have been on a station and did not succeed in getting communication.</p>
