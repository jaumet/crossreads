<p>same time the commandant (Capt Morrison) put off from the shore and came aboard. I went ashore with him in the surf boat and delivered the mails. Being desirous of visiting Angriff's Hafen he decided to accompany us in the "Gabriel". Accordingly we returned on board at 5 o'clock.<br/>At 4 am this morning we weighed anchor and are now (2.30) passing Neumayer River.<br/>Wed 23rd at sea : We arrived at Angriff's Hafen at about 4.30 pm yesterday. I was disappointed to find no ship or boats there that being my sole reason for making the trip. As far as interest and amusement went, however, the visit was well worth while.<br/>Capt Morrison &amp; myself with 5 AB's landed at the native village (Warimoo). Accompanying us was Mr R____ of the N.G. Co. and three boys whose contracts were finished and who were returning thither.<br/>These boys were the absolute limit, too utterly utter for anything. I have seen numerous comic pictures illustrative of natives in European dress but nothing to equal the reality. They were dressed in Khaki with stand up collars and straw hats. The hats were miles too small and fitted exactly as we see them on coons in vaudeville. The ticket bearing the price and size was still attached to them. But what beat all were the umbrellas. These were brand new cheap cotton ones and they still bore the original paper wrapper. I would have given anything for a photograph but unfortunately we have no camera on board.</p>
