 Big Khamsin last night & sand dunes are formed & others blown away. Some Scotchmen I knew in the King's own Scottish Borderers came over & gave me a bottle of Whiskey for New Year celebrations. We sat on the edge of our bunkers and drank it with sand. Sand better than mud tho'. 
 [This paragraph crossed through.]  I note dear old Day is sending me new Bed Soks - I am still wearing the ones she made me last year, quite good. Big mail in - Letters from Mother, Joe & Day., redirected from England & also one to catch me here. Many people wrote, some sent Xmas cards!! a silly idea, to a man in the Desert in the Wet. I hope Mother you will go to Melbourne soon & get out of the heat, with Day.
