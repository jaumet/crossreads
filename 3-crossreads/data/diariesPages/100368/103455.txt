There were a few red lights on the high ridges above, the significance of which I do not at present know. We landed near the C.C.S. and going into their shelter the first thing I saw was a man with part of his head blown off and yet he was still alive. We slept on the beach all night.

Oct 4th Mon.
Made my way to the reinforcement camp in Shrapnel Gully. Just after breakfast when we had fallen in on parade along with other reinforcement the Turks began to shell us and dropped shells fast and furious on the ridge above the gully. What a scatter there was. We all made for places of safety just like rabbits when they have been startled make for their burrows, we made for holes in the earth for the same reason. We were not fortunate in our choice of place. Five of us crowded under a narrow ledge. 
This was our first experience of being under shell fire. They whizzed over our heads, bursting all around us and we spent an anxious hour, trembling at every shell that burst as they threw earth, stones and metal in every direction. However, at the end of an hours bombardment the shelling ceased, none of us having been hit much to our relief. 
After the bombardment a "Taube" made his appearance in the air presumably to see what damage the shelling had done. Not wishing to experience the same again, as we had gone through this
