<p>Headquarters in London and after a bit of fooling about as is generally the case we were marched of to our place where we had to work, which was just oppisite the offices.</p>
<p>We were taken in a room where we were told the whats and whats nots of the place and after we had to stand bye for a while as we had to have a pass to go on the street.  We were told off to our duties which did not start till the next day.</p>
<p>Our next problem was to go and look for a room to stay in and as I had not been in London to much it was very hard to know which way to start, any way while in London your best friend is a policeman so I went up and asked him and he directed me to a place<strike>in</strike> about ten minutes</p>
