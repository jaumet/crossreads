 Mon 17th. Feb  Decided to get some satisfaction today.  First saw the M.O. who referred me to the Senior S.M.O. a Colonel, who gave a grudging consent for my request to be sent to Fovant my proper destination. He referred me to a Captain who would arrange it.  Walked &frac34; miles &amp; waited on the Captain who was sympathetic but would not do it without written authority from of the Colonel.  Hurried back to him &amp; obtained it, then had dinner.  Returned to Captain &amp; after waiting 2 hours agreed to send me to a Staff Captain for the necessary authority.  Fortified with this went to Furlough officer who gave me a warrant to go.  Returned to camp reported that I would be going next day.  Wrote to S.M. &amp; Co. to send my mail to Fovant also &pound;5  as my present wealth amounts to 1&frac12;d &amp; my paybook is in London.  At night went to hear a lecture by a man who had been a prisoner in Germany, rather good.
