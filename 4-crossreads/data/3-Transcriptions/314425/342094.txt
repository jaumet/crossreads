<p>packet to my wife this evening containing one German machine gun belt for use in aeroplanes.</p>
<p>Sunday July 7. 1918. 1433.</p>
<p>Close and cloudy. There is a swimming carnaval today in the lagoon &amp; the swimming pond.<br/>This morning I received a letter dated June 24 from Russell Dusting a gunner in the 38. Battery inquiring how Willie was getting on. He wrote often but got no reply. Before dinner a primus stove blew up in the camp of the 10 machine gunners camped alongside of us and burned down the cook house and mess house and several officers tents alongside narrowly escaped.<br/>[shorthand symbols](I wrote to my dear wife this evening. Letter 135. 2 Pages and included a cartoon from the Daily Mirror.<br/>Green  envelope).<br/>I got a cake of dark American Havelock tobacco given to me last night. We have no difficulty in getting American tobacco now as the authorities have made arrangements to get a supply from America every month instead of Australia. There is less trouble with shipping arrangements.<br/>There is a burial in the cemetary here almost every day. There were 3 a few days ago and 1 this morning. Daily Mail reports that 195 enemy planes were downed last week, a record.</p>
