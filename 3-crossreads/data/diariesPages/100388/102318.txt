12th
Arrived at Cairo 2.30 am, shunted to a siding two miles on where we detrained and had some cocoa bread cheese at a stall There was only one thing wrong with it There was not enough. 
There we unloaded horses, and proceeded to Kasse-el-Nil barracks which is about a mile from the station where we watered them.
Started for Mena at 8.45. It was the worse march I have been on but the scenery round about was gorgeous Everyone including officers were tired and exausted from want of food and sleep when we arrived at Mena a distance of 11 miles from Cairo, at 9.30 am.
More fooling about till 11.30 am. At 12.30 we had some dry bread and cheese. Plenty of work till 6 pm then bless me if I was not put on picquet. The horses were pretty bad and were continuously breaking loose.
