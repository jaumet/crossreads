'Tis indeed a sombre ruin, the place you once called Home
Alas, theres many suchlike on the main road to Bapaume
What once was smiling country side is now a blasted plain
Given o'er to Crows & rats & human moles who bring misery in their train
So little [????], a fond adieu, I've loitered more than seemly
Some day will come the reckoning & the score will blot out cleanly
Thus moralising do I pass, a soldier from Australia
