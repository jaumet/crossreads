<p>sector but the French have hopped over on our right on a 7000 yds front.  The guns opened up at 5 A.M. &amp; continued all day.  Major McCubbin V.C. D.S.O. M.C. M.M. our crack airman has been killed accidentally, has credit of 54 planes.  Fritz nabbed one of our balloons.</p>
<p>Saturday 13th July<br/>A very quiet day fine &amp; cloudy.  Towards evening had some excitement in the air which I will describe as I saw it. -  The hour is 8.30 P.M. &amp; already night draws near bringing thoughts of bed.  Outside all is quiet save for an occasional gun firing and overhead to right &amp; left are the balloons watching the enemy's lines, to pick out gun flashes in the gathering dusk &amp; so locate their batteries.  Suddenly a shot rings out in the sky &amp; I look up for the enemy plane which has occasioned it.  Bang, Bang, bang other guns have picked up the mark &amp; I wait for the bursts to see where he is.  Ah! There he is  two of them, just coming out of the lowering clouds &amp; both are diving at the nearest balloon.</p>
