 Twice we sank into the slimy mud sufficiently to throw our patient off, despite our strongest efforts. After a very heavy carry walking around shell holes, carrying with one handle of the stretched on each man's shoulder and dragging great weights of clay on our feet we succeeded in bringing our man to Mitchell Farm. A party of bearers in front of us had been killed and we were thankful that we had not. We were too exhausted to return and were not wanted to so, after a good shell carried a patient back to Frost House. The RAP was then withdraw being in a useless and exposed position. We then worked carrying back to Bavaria House. By this time the three ambulances were thoroughly mixed.
