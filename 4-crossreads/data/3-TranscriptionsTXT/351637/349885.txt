very much there had been no one present to write a great discrptive account of the events of June 4th as Lawrence understood nothing and that he had heard that during the battle he was on the River Clyde packing his luggage and when told of the fight said 'never mind I will find out what happened from someone later'   We then explained that the presence of Mosely in our camp was extremely objectionable to us. He seemed to have heard a certain amount about this gentleman and asked if he had ever been over the other side. We explained he had spent one hour at Anzac in the course of a round trip.  He then said 'Well he is doing no use here so I think I shall send him back'.  This ended the interview and on leaving we wished him luck.  We then went and saw Colonel Ward who agreed it was undesirable that Radcliffe should live in our midst. So we got all our points satisfactory settled.

I am afraid therefore that the films I have taken up to date will be of small value. However, some of them May come out
