Thursday 6 July 1916A fine day with a slight drizzle of rain towards evening. Was up at 5.30 for physical drill, & parades were also held in the morning & afternoon. Halfway thro' morning parade had to take a party of men to the Divl. Baths, a fair walk & a rather warm one. Unfortunately was not able to have a bath myself, the division that has taken over the baths not having completed their arrangements.
