[Letter written on paper with Church of England Soldiers' Institute  letterhead]27 August 1916
My Dear Mother
Am seizing a fleeting opportunity of writing - for cash!!!  Could not go to Melbourne as am on the beastly guard, but expect to get next week end. Things are "crook" here in dead earnest - raining in oceans & every  corner is flooded to the point of drowning. All of our crowd are stony & destitute with through buying tucker at  1/6 per meal & it seems impossible to save a penny as things are. Please send 1 by wire. It will only cost about 1/6. Wire it to Seymour Camp Depot Post Office Victoria.
I have your last letter & am not surprised to hear about Chas. Poor old chap, I hope he's not having a rough time of it. Will write, when I come off this job, a less hurried letter, but must catch this mail if I want to see Melbourne.
Much love to allHarry
