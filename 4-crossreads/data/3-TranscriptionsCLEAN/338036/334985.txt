Tuesday 18thExceptionally heavy frost had came on top of yesterdays snow & it is now very cold & all lakes & water in the neighbourhood is frozen.  At night a party of us went up to see the Anzac Concert Party at Steenwerck and it was excellent being only excelled by I think the N.Z. Kiwis.  We knew a couple of them as old mates at Liverpool viz young J Gibb & Sawyer. Harold Williams is joining them again next week.
Wednesday 19thThe scenery is marvellous as everything is covered by a record frost & one would swear that it snow.  The peculiar effect of all the large trees carrying this frost all over them was novel.
Thursday 20thAt night a Bridge Tournament at which I was successful in finishing runner up with 6 wins out of 8.  Mr Mobbs (WO) who won 7 came first.  The Committee met & made arrangements for Xmas dinner & Fancy Dress Ball for Xmas Day.
