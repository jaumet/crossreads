After 5 days sailing we arrived in Albany on the 24th October then we anchored we all were mustered & put aboard a tug which made two or three trips & & thereby landed us on the shore. When we landed we went for a route march & passed through Atherton & some very fine scenery  roundabout  We were very lucky to get ashore at all as none of the other troops were allowed to land & we were only there one day as the next we went out into the bay there to anchor to be surrounded by all the other troops [indecipherable]  We are still here with about 20 odd more others . Albany is a nice place also very clean & the hills etc roundabout make it a place to be remembered
