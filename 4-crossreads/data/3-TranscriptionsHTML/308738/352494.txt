<p>got a letter dated 2nd May from Dad<br/>August 10 Tuesday 1915<br/>Working all day feeling well.<br/>A walk each morning along the Breakwater before breakfast is an exercise every man should take. It is very interesting to watch the sea rolling in &amp; dashing against the stone wall, sending spray high in the air, &amp; drenching any one likely to be walking even on the footpath. This breakwater is very necessary around Alexandra as the land is almost under sea level &amp; the great Wall of Cement is the only protection, against the whole city being washed away.</p>
<p>August 11 Wednesday 1915<br/>Working all day, feeling well.<br/>News received of a General Advance at the Dardinelles. Many casualities anxiously waiting to hear how the 6th Reg. fared.<br/>Net fishing over the breakwater is a most exciting experience. The natives have to contend with the back wash &amp; though the water is not deep, the force of the waves drive the natives out &amp; keeps them not only wet but in agony lest the fish should escape whilst they struggle to pick them from the net. The fish here are very sweet &amp; lovely to eat.</p>

<p><u> Why are we Fighting</u>. It is for our property; it is for our liberty; it is for our independence, nay, it is for our very existence, as a nation. It is for our character; it is for our very name as Englishmen; it is for everything Dear &amp; valuable to men on this side of the Grave.</p>
