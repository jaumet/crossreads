on to the Battalion parade when down the rain came in torrents as it happened all our men had their overcoats on but at the rate the rain was falling everyone would have been wet through in 5 minutes in addition to this hail was tearing down a treat, a lot of the Companies were standing waiting for the rest to move up so I started off with mine but it was too ridiculous so I gave the order for the man to get down to the Dental Rooms as soon as they could you should have seen the scatter, when the other men on parade saw this they off for their lives too left a few officers standing there, they got the men on parade about an hour after, nearly every one was wet through by the storm.
