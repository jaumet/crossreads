  
 28 Sept, 1916 El Hassaniya By all accounts we are to clear out to morrow morning at 5 o'clock  We have received no orders Yet but it seems a cert.  One thing it wont take long to pack up, though how Im going to get every thing on the saddle I dont know,  the horse will have a rare load.  The blighter got his heel gauled with the rope on Tuesday & is very sore on it.  I drew 3 quid this morning.  I wonder if we will get in near Cairo as a few seem to think or stay at Hill 70, the latter is not much chop.
