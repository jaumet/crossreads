Such as Sergts entertaining meeting officers on almost level terms vice versa I dare say unheard of in the English Army, but it is a jolly good idea for it brings the officers and N.C.Os together they understand one another all the more instead of being bad for discipline I think it is the reverse
Right joining our dining room is Colonel Milligans room of the 2nd Battalion, it's a wonder that he has not asked us to move for we are pretty noisy at times
There is some talk of Mr Beckett leaving us tomorrow I hope he doesn't for he is a very fine officer admired by all throughout the whole Battalion.
