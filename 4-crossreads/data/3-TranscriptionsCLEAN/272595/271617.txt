  
 29th.   Thank Heaven I feel a tiny bit better today but my cough is still very bad, & at present I have very little interest in life, I know I would make a very bad patient if it should ever be my misfortune to have a long illness stopping in bed breaks my heart, & oh the horrible & rotten medicines we have to swallow, almost as soon drink poison 30th.   A little better again today but still have a headache & feel weak its spreading like wildfire all over this part of the world according to the papers 1st July. Frightfully hot weather & everyone nearly dead myself included sweat all day & night, & soon will be like a matchstick. A big batch of men left here for Australia last night, nearly all had lost limbs or something
