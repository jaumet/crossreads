Oct 18th Not much doing the guard had been reduced because of the apparent impossibility of escape from the Barrack Yard 90 square yards in area.
Our own folks were allowed to cook do for us. The food was much the same tho allowed a little extra flour. No tobacco no money to buy extras, so the authorities allowed us forage parties of 30 at a time out to do shopping
Things were very cheap vegetables plenty for small sum chicken 4d. Turkeys 2/- each (One chap said he knew a Turkey that wasn't worth a damn let alone 2/- he was prepared to give it up any old time.)
