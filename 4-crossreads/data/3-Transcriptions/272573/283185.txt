<p>Tucker is very poor in this C.C.S. We live like princes in our C.C.S. in comparison to this one.</p>
<p>July 21st. Sat.<br/>Went to Poperhinge along with D. I. The place was crowded with troops. A nice place but badly knocked about by shells  Big numbers of Observation balloons are in close touch here.</p>
<p>July 22nd. Sun.<br/>Beautiful morning, shrapnel being sent into Pop to-day.</p>
<p>Very bust in O.T.</p>
<p>Five new teams arrived here to-day mostly Americans.</p>
<p>July 23rd. Mon.<br/>There are four C.C.S.'s here and each takes it in turn to receive patients</p>
<p>The railway runs through between and troops, ammunition etc are continually going up and down here.</p>
<p>Heavy, continuous, bombardment is going every night now.</p>
<p>Got orders to return back to our unit to-day</p>
<p>Had a very pleasant stay here and incidently learned a few tips</p>
<p>These C.C.S.'s have been here for about two years. They have there grounds nicely laid out, growing flowers and vegetable on their spare land.</p>
<p>There is a great many wounded up in these part, heavy fighting is the rule, and Hospital trains go down here every day.</p>
<p>From Bailleul we get one view of Mount Des Cats and Mount Noir from Remy Siding we get the other view</p>
