<p>Started a long letter to Melv. while waiting for George.  Cloudy and fairly cold wind.  Letter from Fanny last night.  Told I needn't go out last night but afterwards Kernot told me to go out for blowing mine.  Went out at 9 taking 4 tins (25 lb each) of blasting.  Had to make a wide circuit round house as Fritz shelling pretty heavily.  Jensen got a slight wound in knee and went home but is still staying with us.  Edmonds, Bailey, Toogood, Clow and Read with me and walked out to trenches at company headquarters quietly and waited there for Kernot. <strike>who</strike> I &amp; Edmonds waited at the house and Kernot didn't come till three quarters of an hour later.  I got down the hole and tied tins together and set them and Kernot came and fixed two fuses.  Some whizz bangs rather close.  He posted the 4 sentries and tried to light the fuses.  One he lit the covering which went out and when the other caught he got such a scare that he didn't wait for the first and hopped right out and hurried back.  Walked back to company till she blew making a good explosion and a lot of dirt came out.  Roads completely blocked.  Went straight home and arrived at 1.30.  Quiet.  Cloudy still.</p>
