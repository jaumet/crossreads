bread bags at 2/9d each. In the first place none of ever saw them. "They are not worth 2 1/2 d each let alone 2/9/ Anyhow the unanimous & rather decided answer is we won't pay for them .Naturally a deficiency is inevitable & would have been paid for only for the way we were treated. The Chief Steward has the matter in hand & all the men want is to bring the Chief Steward along & judging by their tone he had better stop away. The officers say it must  be paid or it will be docked. When they were confronted with the high canteen prices, short weight in jam etc - all they had to say was "Don't know anything about that "- No, they don't know anything like that. Well the question simply is that the men refuse to pay & the money cannot be stopped legally & moreover there will be a far greater shortage in other ways if they do so.
Lights out was blown
