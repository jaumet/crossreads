<p>very respectable hills. Our boat is no chicken for size &ndash; she's about 9000 tons &ndash; but this is treating her with no respect; she bucks &amp; kicks, rolls, flings her  nose up to the skies &amp; wallows in the spray just like any coaster. Not that she is not a fine sea boat &ndash; she's one of the best &ndash; but in such a devil's cauldron she's all but helpless &ndash; a cockle shell lost among hills of water.</p>
<p>This afternoon a few of us got up on deck &amp; climbed on the derricks amidships. We had a nice position there, about 40 feet above water &amp; clear of the waves, thus we were able to watch one of the finest sights it is possible to see in one's lifetime &ndash; the centre of a cyclone with its 'pyramid' waves.There's no long even roll about it &ndash; only immense pyramids of water lifting up in all directions, massing together &amp; often falling in huge masses of white surf. The roar of these seas is indescribable &amp; looking down, as we rode to the crest of one, we had a view of hills &amp; valleys with what looked like an occasional flat &amp; all clouded with smoke like spray.</p>
