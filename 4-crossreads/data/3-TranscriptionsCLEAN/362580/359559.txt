  
 lovely, just one mass of wild flowers in huge variety, a topping change from a couple of months ago. 
 As we've been having a spell in most comfortable quarters with charming surroundings you can imagine that we're living well & enjoying a bonnie time, especially as one occasionally has an opportunity of visiting some of the larger villages & even cities.  Then, a fellow meets dozens of old pals, its just great, & all the boys are as happy as larry & in top hole condition. 
 Sorry we cant give you any news Bella. 
 Please give my love to Auntie Bella, Al, Eth, young Eddie & yourself. 
 Hoping you are all enjoying good health I am 
 Yours Sincerely & in the pink Chas H. Copp.
