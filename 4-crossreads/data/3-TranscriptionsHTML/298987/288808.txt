<p>Tuesday 20th<br/>Drill this morning at least <strike>it w</strike> we are supposed to drill. We do  a few moments untill the Officers get away &amp; then sit down. If an Officer comes along when we are doing nothing the Sargent says he is giveing  us a lecture &amp; the Officer smiles &amp; passes on. Went to see a Company of Infantry practicing an attack covered by Tanks The tanks can go practically anywhere &amp; it is wonderful how they stand the bump when they go head first into a trench</p>
