Sunday 10/12/16rained all night, water outside, just on a level with our dugout if it rains today must shift somewhere never seen anything like it mud & water everywhere, and bitterley cold. What they expect the Australians to do in this weather beats me. The Pioneers have been taken out of it, so ought we, in fact all of us & finish this dam war. I can see myself laid up with Rheumatism soon can feel it in my legs at night.Bread, cheese & margarine to day.  They are thinking of giving us gum-Boots at last.  Can't sleep for the cold and dampness.Pay to day deferred 17-14-0 owing 2-4.9.its dark here at 4. & daylight about 7. am. We get our tea or dinner I suppose they call it about 4.30 or 5  we have no candles so imagine us at the only hot meal of the day, in the dark instead of giving it us at 12. when we only get tea & Bread & Jam & cheese if you can get it.A fellow shot himself in the foot either accident or otherwise & no wonder  its enough to make us all shoot ourselves this pig's life.  No wonder the huns are wining & they are.
Monday 11/12/16Pay 2-5-9. deferred 17-15-0.weather cleared last night & to day is fine & bright.our Planes were up early this morning & the usual gun fire started Later Fritz  sent his up & things get merry  none were brought down & fritz only hung on the edge as it where & then got for home.No cigarette issue or Tobacco or Matches, the more uncomfortable you are at the front the less you get.thats because they give the QMs Job to boys  same with the rum if the boy feels molified you get it when you should.  If he feels a bit wet & and cold 'Oh' the morning will do or any old time. Men of 40 to 50 are kept in the ranks who would see the Job carried out & these young fellows are given the easy stay away from the line Jobs & this spells efficiency in the Australian Army, if it wasn't for the wonderful spirits of the men don't know what would happen.Haven't had a bath for 2 months and am lousy  feel like the dirtiest tramp I ever saw. Am told we are here for another 7 days.3 PM raining again.  Livingstone gone to hospital again, am in charge,  time they recognised me I think.

P.M   our dug-out ringing wet, am lying in sandbags that ooze water  wonder how  long I'll stand it    Bread &Jam again  one would think we were a lot of children they were feeding   the men away back get their Bacon & stews etc & can buy anything else they want.
