Pal of Mine - continued
A rough hewn bit of limestone on the spot where Ginger liesBears a proper soldiers tribute - "a brave man never dies"& I hear the sentnel saying when the judgment story's toldAll's Well Pass little comrade to your dugout made of gold
Where the wailing croon of Shrapnel plays a requiem o'er you headIn the slime of muddy Flanders where the bravest's  fought & bledI'll go looking for you Ginger when I've crossed lifes firing line& wether hell or heaven may I meet you Pal o mine.
