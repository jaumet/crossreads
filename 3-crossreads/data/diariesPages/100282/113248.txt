we were not allowed on deck until we were some distance out, I made the best of my situation uncomfortable as it undoubtedly was, I took my tunic off, for it was very hot, laid down somehow there I stopped till early in the morning when I found we had arrived in Le Havre, I also stripped myself of the life belt what a nuisance they are, they seem to weigh you down.
Marched away from the wharf at 7.30 saw some Yanks plenty of Englands Volunteer Women workers on the way out, these workers looked very smart in their Government issue gave us plenty of smiles as we marched past. Had a march of 7 miles or so before we reached our Camp, here I found Len he is Orderly Sgt here, needless to say I was pleased to see him, after we had got fixed up, we were issued with our gas helmets put through the tests, then came the Medical inspection which did not last long.
