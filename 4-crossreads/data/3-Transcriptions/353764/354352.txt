<p>14th Dec 15<br/>We arrived off "Aden" at 10 am this morning but did not put into Port.  Three other boats which have accompanied us went in.  On examining the Shore with Glasses we could discern a Warship anchored there, also rows of Red Tiled roof houses.  It is very mountainous County &amp; extremely hot.</p>
<p>We have since been running up the Arabian Coast &amp; passed the place where the Mohammedans make their Pilgrimages to "Mecca" "Medina" &amp; "Jeddah" although no one who is not of their faith is allowed to go.  unfortunately the Pilgrim Season has just passed so we did not see them, but I understand that some of them come right out from the Shore in their "Dhows".</p>
<p>In describing the Arabian Country &amp; Coast Line, I would like to say that it is a terrible place.  The Coast for a long way is dotted with huge mountains of sand which make the eyes very sore to look at it for any time.  On proceeding along further it opens out &amp; rolls back into the interior in one vast desert, with nothing but roll &amp; ridge of Sand.  Absolutely no veg-</p>
