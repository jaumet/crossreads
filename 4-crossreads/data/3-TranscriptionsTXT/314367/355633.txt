We smoked cigarettes & talked - The instant we got to the gangway we heard the Eastern was aground & had sent for help - Our anchor was up - Our Commander got instructions & out wewell went - full belt to the rescue - Night closed on us & the velvety heaven was star spangled & I had my mattress - right aft - I had the centre of that mattress opposite a stanchon so as not to roll right off into the ditch & I slept the sleep of the pure in heart -When our boat came alongside the gangway I asked the 3 officers to have a drink - It was a rush & I never saw 3 men get outside a bottle of cider in quicker time - By Jove it was good - We're going to work the Eastern for our Xmas dinner & keep ours for New Year - The thing to say is - We have only biscuits & a few lemons - Real - hard up - hard grafting - British Seamen -
