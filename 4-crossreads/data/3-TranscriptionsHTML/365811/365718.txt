<p>4<br/>a long time now. The latest letter I have had was dated October 28th. They were meaning to go down to Manly for the summer. What has become of the later letters I dont know.</p>
<p>I must not wander on any longer or you will think I have absolutely nothing to do. As a matter of fact all I have now to do is to sleep &ndash; but even that must be done.</p>
<p>My kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; Keith also to Major &amp; Mrs. Curtis</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>R. J. Hunter</p>
