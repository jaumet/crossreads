  
 October, 1915 Saturday 9 Put on my heavy service boots for the first time, they are stiff from the blood that ran down my leg when wounded & I find I am not as strong as I thought. Walked through the village of Helonan & watched the milk being delivered by driving the cows or water buffaloes to the doors. The bedouin drives his goats & sheep to the Butchers shop & the butcher picks out a lamb or a ram & pays & kills it right away meat is dear in Egypt & the troops are fed on frozen meat.
