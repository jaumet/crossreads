 All artillary was removed with the exception of 2 guns & these were finally destroyed Out of about 700 horses & mules we got them all away at Sulva Pier, with the exception of about 50 which at the last were worked night & day They were not destroyed by us probably as a reward for good & faithful service. Anyhow they were played out.  Only one of the original mules, out of hundreds remained.  He was known as Enver Pasha & spent the last few months as a pet. He had a number of bullets in him. Our losses in mules used to be fairly heavy. [Ismail Enver Pasha or Enver Pasha, 1881-1922, was a Turkish military officer and politician, serving as the Turklish Minister of War during World War 1.  'Pasha' was a military rank equivalent to Brigadier.] Although the enemy never bothered us much by air reconnaissance our people took no risks & we continually had an aeroplane up to keep their aeronauts from coming over. On the 2nd second last night we heard an aeroplane overhead & were much relieved when we learned it was one of our fleet. 
 The 3000 men were got away in batches timed to embark at 6, 9 & 11 pm. The distances from the flanks to the piers was about 2 miles so you can image how much depended on the enemy not breaking through our defence in the centre. I was timed to go at 6, but there were a few too many so had to wait near the pier till 11.
