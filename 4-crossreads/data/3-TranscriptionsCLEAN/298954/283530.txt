Thu. 27th Sep. (cont.)The funnel has been opened by a shell, another has passed through the wireless-room.   Blood everywhere.   A cane-lounge with a draught-board beside it is soaked with the blood of a wounded man who was placed in it - the draught pieces are lying in the pool of blood underneath.
Sun. 30th Sept.The "Maru" is being patched up and made sea-worthy:-  we were strongly of the opinion that she was to be sent into Batavia with us on board as another "Appam" prize-court case.
This afternoon, as we sat under the awning aft and discussed what we going to do in Batavia, (Robby was selling imaginary passage-tickets on the "Hitachi" at 20 above par), a horrified rumour-carrier rushed along with the report that most of the Japs. were then being brought over to the "Wolf"!    And it was true! our hopes of going to Batavia went down to zero.
