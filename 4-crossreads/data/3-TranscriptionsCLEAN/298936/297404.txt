 Sunday 5 
 This is the first quiet Sunday for some time. A few patients to attend to in morning & just finished (11 a.m.). Wonder what to do now. 
 Did not have long to wait. At 11.30 a train of wounded arrived; dinner late & another train afterwards, then tea & still another train. Carrying stretchers all the time up stairs & along corridors until my arms felt pulled out & my hands refused to grip. 
 Fairly done up in the evening but took a stroll & met Mat [indecipherable] who was with me on the Suffolk, also man from front. His information was not what could be described as pleasing.
