  
 10th April two or 3 shiploads went away early in the morning, taking Harold away. He got word the day before, so it was no secret & Uncle Walter & Isett & others went to see him off, including Miss Meade! to everyone's surprise It almost looks a case of - to put it in the poet's words - "how blessings brighten as they take their flight!" Or, in plain prose, we prize things most when we lose 'em. I don't know whether Harold kissed her, or only said So long. He went as a sergeant. 
 Yesterday, Sunday, Ida was up, & in addition to Olly, Edgar & Radford, who made a set with Dene, the three Bairds Jessie, Maggie & Belle came for the afternoon & evening. We told them all about you & your adventures, & they were most interested to look over all the photos they had not previously seen. They screamed at one of a Sydney B.C. picnic at Cabarita, here you & Dene are visible in the front row, about the size of pumpkins, with little sailor hats on. "And now he has gone to the war!" Aunts Kate & Edie came up too, so we had a good houseful.
