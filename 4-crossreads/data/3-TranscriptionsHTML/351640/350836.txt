<p>the slackers and loafers in the Community become the more numerous.   You[r] description of the "Will they never come" was clear and interesting.  Many thanks for it.  If it be necessary for more to fight than will volunteer, then the loafers must be compelled to stand behind a gun.</p>
<p>I half expected a cable from you today in reply to mine forwarded to you on Saturday last.   No one was informed that today was the anniversary of my birth.   None here personally interested in the Old Man.  You will have remembered, and will have spoken about the event amongst yourselves.</p>
<p>My Kitty appears to be quite an enthusiastic musician.   Good my Kitty!</p>
<p>Nothing to pay on the letters my dear.</p>
<p>The war still rages fiercely as far as one can judge from the papers.   The Dardanells problem is harder to crack than some people expected, and it may be long before Constantinople is in the hands of the Allies.   Elsewhere in Europe the great fights appear to vary in result, today one side gains a few kilometers, tomorrow it is the other contestant who has achieved something.   A stubborn and bloody fight, truly, without parallel in any previous age. Mirabile dictu!!!.   When will it end?   God alone knows.</p>
<p>The papers of this evening announce great changes in the British Cabinet.   What does such mean?  It is not clear to me</p>
<p>Glad that you liked the Egyptian pictures.  Some go forward this mail depicting the New Heliopolis. In the great Palace Hotel, No. 1. General Hospital, from Australia has its headquarters.   A great institution run by Ramsay Smith of Adelaide &amp; Barret from Melbourne, two capable industrious men, who have knowledge enough to manage any concern.</p>
