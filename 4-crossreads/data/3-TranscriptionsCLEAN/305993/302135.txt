  
 22.11.18 Took in 2500 tons of coal as bunkers & engines overhauled, troopdecks & all ready for the transfer of troops.  In the city last night the soldiers very quiet, very strong patrols.  News through that the British government are going to pay for all damage done to shops & the looting done by the soldiers in their drunken rejoicing state when the Armistice was signed.  Now things are normal again & everything peaceful in the City.  Destroyers & warships of the Allied nations are moored here taking things easy after their hard work of escorting & awaiting orders.  The Naval gunners & signalmen have been taken off the cargo transports & are on the depot war ship Hannibal which has being stationed here throughout the war as a supply, repair & guard ship.  The Naval crew of the troopships still remain on board their respective ships.  News through this day of 20 submarines Germans surrendered & passed over to the British Admirality. 
 23.11.18 Hospital ships coming & going from Palastine daily very busy & also Prisnors of war ships.  Called at the 21st General hospital there lies thousands of wounded & sick prisnors of war & otherwise from Palastine & Turkey.  The staff told us that all the hospitals were packed & that the nurses were simply run off their feet.  Some of the cases being awful.  It would be a great relief when Peace was finally declared.  So that no more soldiers would be wounded & sick.
