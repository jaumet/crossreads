rifles, so Jack Hayes I took a run up to the 3rd Battn to see if they had any spare ones but no luck, we never got one so we had to make them up from the Cooks etc, when we moved off we were correct, I marched out 36 strong in my platoon wonder how many I will bring out, for it's a moral we are going to the Somme
They studied our comfort again for we were taken as far as Renilhurst in the Light railway trains passing through Dickebusch, Ouderdom another little village, I was very surprised to notice how close to the fighting area the Belgian farmers have come, they have crops growing looking real well almost into Dickebusch itself, taking a line from what happened down south they are taking a risk of losing all
