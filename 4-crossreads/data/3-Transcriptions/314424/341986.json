<p>she mentioned that she received my diary No. 6 &amp; a letter from Ireland</p>
<p>Monday May 6. 1918. 1372.<br/>At 7.p.m last night orders came through for 5 limbers for Engineers and we got away at once to the dump in this village but there was not enough material for us to load up so we picked up our load at Heilly and at Mericourt, and then passed on through Ribemont and Breur passing Treur on our right. At Breur a guide met us and we delivered our load near a cemetry not far from the front line. There was a company of men to carry the pickets which our loads consisted of to the required place for wiring. Then we turned and came back as far as Riebemont, and from there took another road which led us on to the main Albert-Amiens road &amp; arrived back in Frainvilliers at 11.30. Our journey to our destination was about 6 miles and the short way back about 5 miles. This morning we lay in to 8.30 had breakfast &amp; was on Parade again at 9.a.m nothing the worse for our journey. There were few enemy shells, but most of the time our artillery was blazing away &amp; with the limber rattling over the cobbles &amp; through the slush the noise was deafening. The only discomfort was the drizzling rain which continued most of the time going up.</p>
