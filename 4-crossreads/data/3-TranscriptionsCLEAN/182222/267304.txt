Writing this on a Roman Road above Wizernes. The war is not in sight but the Dope is. I've been pouring the (soft drink) Cider of the Patrae down his neck. I, too, feel Bon. The transport wendeth atru out the lea above 10K. in our rear. Fang. etc. is where Allah wills it may be found.       Fauquembergues                                                            (fang. for brevity to all who pass) is a quiet & characteristic little French town hidden in a wooded valley of the Aa. which flows thro & under the town & drives the inevitable mill wheel.
