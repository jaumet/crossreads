<p>March 1915<br/>Monday 29<br/>Am expecting the doctor to ask me if I feel well enough to go out. Of course I shall say no as a chap might as well get thoroughly well before starting work again. The weather is getting very hot now and making itself felt. Hot winds blow &amp; raise clouds of dust and sand.</p>
<p>Tuesday 30<br/>Doing well. Doctor asked me If I was strong enough to go out. He is sending me out on Thursday. Oh well I have had a good spell in here although it has not been a holiday altogether. Went down to camp &amp; saw all the chaps. They are only working about 4 &frac12;  a day but do a lot of night work.</p>
