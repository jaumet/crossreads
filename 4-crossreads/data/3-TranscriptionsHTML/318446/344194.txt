<p>Boxing Night<br/>I have to amend my remarks about the last stunt.  <strike>We attacked &amp; took, not Magdabeh but a place five miles further on by name Bir Ouled Aly, we also captured three</strike> guns consisting of a battery of mountain guns &amp; several limber loads of rifles, stores, etc.<br/>It is said that Rafa is also evacuated by the turks.<br/>Am on Picket tonight.  My overcoat is already wet through as it has rained before during stables, it is raining now &amp; I will bet ten to 1 that it will be raining when I go on picket again.  Curse the war.<br/>They are landing stores on the shore now from a supply ship.  The place will soon be like Anzac.  The railway is expected to reach here about the first</p>
