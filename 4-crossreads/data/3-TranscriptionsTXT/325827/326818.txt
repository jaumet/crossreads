By the way does sermon tasting mean sermon making. I hope so.About Pat's waiting while we taste sermons you must see Pats mother. She may have something to say re that.
Hooray, too windy and cloudy tonight for planes. You have no idea of what night bombing is like from what it was when you knew it. It is indescribable. Regular and incessant and with those wopping by chaps that carry a bomb that shakes the earth and hum like a cream separator in your earhole. I fancy you must feel the bump when they lob. A piece of bomb hit the sandlaps of next tent to mine the other night. This is the scheme now. Better a foot under the ground now  than 6 ft later.
Tons of affectionRid
