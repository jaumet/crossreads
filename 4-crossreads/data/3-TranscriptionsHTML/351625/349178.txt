<p>So far the weather we have had has has been fairly good, no real cold weather at all to speak of although we had a couple of days pretty chilly last week end but it has got warm again &amp; the longer it keeps like this the better as the winter will be quite long enough for us even if it does not start till late.  According to your last letter &amp; mother's Ingledene seems to be looking very fresh &amp; pretty with all the spring flowers coming out.  I can just about imagine what it would be like everything green &amp; flowers all in bloom.  Ken is still an Act/Corp. here but I took mine down the other day as it was of no use to me at all at the time as we had to carry on our training the same with or without it &amp; we were treated pretty well as privates &amp; in any case all acting rank comes down</p>
