<p>Friday 11-8-16<br/>There is a big 12" naval gun mounted on a Railway truck with other carriages to accommodate the Gun crew also a loco to pull it about near our camp.  When the  gun is about to be fired the Engine gives a blast the Brakes are set on and Bang &ndash; our little humpy fairly rocks every time.  I don't care much for the French people I have seen so far.  They are very grasping.  Its funny to hear our Aeroplanes signalling to the Guns they do so by means of hooters.  I have often seen one hovering over the German lines till one of their guns had fired &amp; then back it comes full rip sometimes with a few puff balls after it having spotted the position of the gun.  in a few minutes one of our heavy guns would be feeling for that gun or Battery.</p>
<p>Sunday 13-8-16<br/>We started 3 days holiday today.  Went into town this morning &amp; viewed the church there is a creek flowing under the church.  Went to a Picture show last night near the Bison.  I do not like any of the french people that I have met so far.  They charge us  awfull prices for everything 3 Francs for tin of Fruit. 2 francs tin of Milk   [indecipherable]</p>
