<p>1915<br/>Dec. 28 Tue.<br/>Went for a jolly long walk this afternoon occupying fully three hours. Through Gezira, Kasr-el-Nil, Garden City, City of Cairo, &amp; back through Kasr-el-Nil &amp; Gezira.<br/>Have decided to take up French &amp; Arabic in earnest  &amp; put an advt. in the Egyptian Mail to-day for a teacher. So far I have very slight knowledge of Arabic although I can do better at French notwithstanding the fact that I can get very slight opportunities for conversation.</p>
