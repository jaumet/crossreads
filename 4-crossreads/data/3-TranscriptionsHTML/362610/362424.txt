<p>Thursday 27 July 1916<br/>Spelling in the transport paddock outside Albert during the morning, once being awakened by someone who proved to Jocelyn Carr paying a visit to see how I was getting on. In the afternoon we got our orders to move &amp; by a very roundabout route we went to a thick wood on a hill near Contay &amp; there camped in Canadian huts. My duty was to bring along cripples in a motor lorry in rear so I was saved the tramp. Visited by General Birdwood &amp; Lord Northcliffe &amp; cinematograph pictures of the visit were made.</p>
