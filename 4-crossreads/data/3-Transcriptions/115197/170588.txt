<p>An excellent play with a weak cast and some faulty production.&nbsp; Stage too small for spectacular effects - Amateur acting - a great last act.</p>

<p>Parcels - Letters - Diary - Kings Cross - Drury Lane - &quot;Samson &amp; Delilah&quot;.&nbsp; An Australian in the audience.&nbsp; A hurried departure, and a night in the corridor</p>
