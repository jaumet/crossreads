 My dearest Mother  &  Sisters, 
 Of course I'm feeling disappointed at not haring from you for so long. Dorothy received a letter from Belle a couple of days ago dated April 10th or something near that. Well, the last I got was dated March 25th - Suppose mine have gone to Miss Conyers   &  she has not had time to forward them, that is why I've given above address.
