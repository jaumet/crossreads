have a look at the sector we are going to take over, we are leaving about Wednesday so rumour has it. Received the parcel of Turkish Coat of Arms cards this evening they are all gone again, they go like wild fire. Was down at the lecture this afternoon held in the big cinema hall in Meteren it was on Verdun was given by the "area commandant", it was real good I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
A big fight took place this afternoon in Meteren it was between Hollingsworth Kirkpatrick of our Battalion the former challenged any one in the AIF. of 10st, he belonged to the D.A.C. it created a great amount of interest went the full twenty rounds, our man won, so the old Battalion is holding its own all round, (hang this pen it don't belong to me mine has run dry just at present).
26th. There was a full marching order parade for the Battalion this morning it was held on our football ground.
