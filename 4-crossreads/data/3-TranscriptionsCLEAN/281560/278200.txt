  
 16/1/16 A quiet Sunday and we are shaking down into our new home. Am comfortable enough, I'm with a lot of fine chaps. My company has for officers.Leiut Taylor.O.C.,Leiut Lacy, Lenahan, & Prescott, rather decent fellows. Our quarters are on the lower deck. The mess tables occupy both sides of the deck, in the middle are the hammock racks. We sleep in hammocks suspended from the beams above. There are 16 at my mess table, it is numbered, and our rations are portioned and served to mess orderlies at the "galley" amidships.  As the "Osterly" is carrying passengers we are rather cramped for deck space, for the promenade decks are reserved for them. The sea is quite calm.
