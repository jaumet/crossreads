<p>September, 1917. Tuesday 25<br/>Gas shells used and small H.E. [indecipherable] guns were knocked. Back on to job and crump shrapnel burst over us at 5 to six so retired. Fritz had good observation and had two balloons up and paid some attention to working parties although perhaps ours too small.</p>
