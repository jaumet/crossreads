Blows & I met the girls again this afternoon we went away out to Alcester Lanes End right out in the country & it was simply glorious, all the fields yellow & white with buttercups & daisies & a brilliant sun shining, we went boating on the Worcester canal for a while & then a ramble round the lovely hawthorn & May hedges, the country now is a blaze of color with lovely Rhodendrons of all hues, I am beginning to feel splendid again & have quite forgotten the horrors of war nor do I ever wish to see France again though I know this to be impossible for I shall have to go back some day, after I recover sufficiently.
There is a great scarcity here in films for Kodaks they are very scarce & shops will only sell them to you as a favor.
