Friday 16-2-17German Planes came over last night flying very low.  The anti aircraft guns were firing at them & the shells burst so low that the fragments were fairly raining on the roof of the Mill.  Fritz kept his machine guns going & He managed to blow up a big ammunition Dump a few miles away.  In the cold weather they had a great deal of trouble with the logs owing to the sap being frozen & blunting the saw.  There is a Bomb School close to our camp.
