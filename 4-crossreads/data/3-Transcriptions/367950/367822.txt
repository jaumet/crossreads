<p>24th April 1917 At Sea</p>
<p>Cold and windy. All kits to be taken down to No 5 hatch to be fumigated Drizzly rain and we are not used to that.<br/>Pte James Howard Mitchell of the Canterbury Mounted rifles died this afternoon at 1.15 pm from spinal paralisis caused through wounds received in action at Rafa on the 9th January and he was buried at sea at 4 pm the whole ships company being present. The burial service was read by Chaplain General Mackay our "padre".<br/>The ships engines were stopped during the ceremony.<br/>Oh the irony of Fate! He was severely wounded at Rafa and only expired today, one days steam out of Melbourne. We have been delayed through the <strike>German</strike>  Raider which has   been floating around</p>
