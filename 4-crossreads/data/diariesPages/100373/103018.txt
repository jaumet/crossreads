that there was something the matter with me. I soon realised that sea sickness had me in its grip. Had a few hours respite from it during the day, engaged in baggage carrying, thinking by this means to work of any liklihood of an attack of sickness again. All to no avail for I was barely done with that work when a more severe attack of sickness took hold of me. I got down below to our sleeping quarters and I felt so miserable and wretched that I could not fix up my hammock properly. A mate, the name of Middleton, assisted me to fix up the hammock. After it was fixed up we discovered that the hammock belonged to him and not to me and he was just about as helpless as myself with sea-sickness.

He took pity on me however, and assisting me into the hammock he quitely went below the table and slept there all night.

Arose feeling much better, on duty as mess orderly. Received a letter from home which stated George Stevenson had been killed in France. Wrote a few letters home. Late in the evening we passed the "heads" near Melbourne. Slept up on deck this evening. There was a very strong breeze blowing but we were fortunate in having plenty of blankets.

When we awoke in the morning we had anchored near Port Melbourne.
