Cable five section nine stop   meanwhile the 6th Gourkas  [censor's deletion] advanced gallantly up the slopes of Sari Bair and actually succeeded in reaching the neck between Chunuk Bair and Hill Q stop   it was from here that they looked down on the Dardanelles but were unfortunately unable to hold their position in the face of violent counter attacks and heavy shell fire stop  meantime the Turks counter attacked [censor's deletion] the left column in great strength and they were compelled to withdraw to the lower slopes of Sari Bair stop  meantime throughout the day and night the New Zealanders succeeded in maintaining their hold on Chunuk Bair although the men were thoroughly exhausted stop 
 during the night of the 9th  the exhausted New Zealanders were relieved by the Loyal North Lancashire Regiment and the 5th Wilts stop  at dawn on the 10th the Turks who had been strongly reinforced made a most desperate assault on our lines from Hill Q and Chunuk Bair stop  to the strength of a division in successive lines they hurled themselves quite regardless of their lives on the North Lancashires and 5th Wilts who after a desperate resistance were driven from their position by artillery fire and sheer weight of numbers further down the slopes of Chunuk Bair stop  following up their success the Turks charged right over the crest and endeavoured to gain the great gully south of Rhododendron Ridge evidently with the intention of forcing their way between our lines and the Anzac position stop  but they reckoned without our artillery and the ships guns stop  this great charge of four successive lines of infantry in close formation were plainly visible to all our warships
