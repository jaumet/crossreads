no stunts, plenty of racket at times & lots of illumination at night.
I haven't heard from Tan since I saw him last & as I know the N.Z's have been getting having some hard goes, I am rather worried.
The two Macs are well so are Billy Balcombe & Squiz.  Brolga Hill is going into the Flying Corps.  It will suit him.  I wouldn't fly with him he's such a hare brained mad old coot but a dear old stick.  I shall tell you lots of funny stories about him when I get back.
My two latest great pals are good fellows & drop over to see me now & then (I don't get out much).  You'd like them especially Jock Micklejohn, they are both young & make me feel terribly old at times.
Well I must stop.  Fare-the-well.  My love to Graham, the Boss & Mac.  I hope things are all right.
Yours to a cinderWilkie
