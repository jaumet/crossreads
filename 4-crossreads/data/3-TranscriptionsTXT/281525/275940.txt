 1/11/17 Naples Via Roma and a fine long street too. Went to the Cathedral of St Januarius and walking into the old church saw the font where Constantine was baptised &ndash; a circular stone well. In this church is kept the sacred blood of St Januarius which performs to miracle of liquefying thrice a year. The air here was full of fumes of incense. Here and there in the streets are little shrines usually with a candle or other lights burning and passing men take off their hats. My old guide and the coachman were constantly touching their hats. Many stop and cross themselves and pray. Returned to the Hotel du Vesuve. Just in front is the sea front and the old Castel dell Ovo now used as a military prison. My guide is very devout but nevertheless was most solicitous that feet should not stray on flowery paths under anyone less capable than him!
