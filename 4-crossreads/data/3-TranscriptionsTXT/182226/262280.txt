 Slight shower of rain during the night made everything sloppy &amp; uncomfortable. 
 Had to go off sick today just a touch of dysentery, I hope to be well again tomorrow. 
 They are putting a fourth man in our happy home, it will be a bit crowded.

 Have been pretty crook &amp; off duty, had a good nights sleep.
