francs for Italian trip, received all the documents and changed some money in lire. Went to Caserne Pepiniere and drew 200 francs of pay. A murky fog settled down on the city just after lunch and the air was extremely cold. The Elysee palace is most sumptuously decorated and has real Gobelins tapestries but during the War it has become more of a family hotel. The Continental is not by a long way so luxurious but is now better heated and being always full of a floating population the service is very good. Waste much money on leave, needlessly buying expensive food and travelling in expensive way. Will try plain clothes as an antidote to this but it seems to do a city cheaply one must know well so as to be at ease. Tips a sore point and one in uniform can risk no brawl or repulse no importunist. Some of the French Colonial Armies have great breasts of medals.
