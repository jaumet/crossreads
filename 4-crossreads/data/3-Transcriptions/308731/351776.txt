<p>Dear Old Thin Bill Jam-Tin.</p>
<p>I was at the hall of Mrs. Veal I spose I told you that I was going to be My Pretty Maid.  They all gave me a clap but they never gave any of the others one.  I have to be dressed up.  We have to be dressed up in Nurseay rhyme's.  Frank and the other little boy have a song to learn.  I have a whole page to learn.</p>
<p>Frank is just starting his letter to you Mum is nearly finished two pages.  We have to go to-morrow to learn again and I think I will have to say it to-morrow without looking on the paper.</p>

<p>[Note from mother.]<br/>Ruths writing is getting worse fast.</p>
