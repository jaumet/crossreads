<p>28.10.,15</p>
<p>Thurs 28th<br/>Today has been warm, but a heavy sea still running &amp; the Small Hospital boat (that takes this sick from the pier to the Ship) has been in difficulties all day the sea would wash her away to the north &amp; towards the beach, &amp; it kept one tugboat busy all day towing her to &amp; from the shore to the <strike>beach</strike> Ship I raised enough energy to go for a swim &amp; do some washing this afternoon the water was not at all chilly &amp; I enjoyed the dip some bullets however cut our swim short as they commenced to fall in the water too close to be comfortable; I believe on Walkers Ridge a good bit of mining has been going on by both sides, but everything is very quiet here, The warboats are shooting every day</p>
