<p>Thursday 12 [11] April1917 [1918]<br/>The C of E Padre from the 27th visits me &amp; is kindness itself, he goes up the line Sunday next &amp; a new one, Foster by name, takes his place.<br/>No trace of the M.O. today but he is no loss.  He was evidently taken down off some shelf, dusted, &amp; sent to the front when M.O's became scarce &amp; has no more real man in him than these bed posts.  If only our "dear old man" could come &amp; sit on the bed &amp; take charge of me I should be well at once.<br/>Reports come in of Australians being surrounded &amp; taken prisoners by Turks <strike>near</strike> in Palestine so some of our boys are in the enemy's hands.</p>
