A stroll on pier and lost Mc so went back to shop and met Townsend by chance and <strike>lost</strike> had lunch. Nicholl &amp; someone else came in when we had finished and we went down to pier and got rid of Townsend  Got the hump and decided to go to Camps Bay and stopping at Sea Point. Pleasant trip by car and at Sea Point soon fixed up Lynch. Not many people there  Very hot and walked up hill towards Camps Bay and caught car. Very pleasant there and got a number of snaps.</p>
