If the medicos keep on leaving Australia few will remain to look after our own people.   But 'tis war, & who knows what that will bring about.   And such great war too?  Dr. Hollwood [Hollywood] from Maitland also in uniform .   My regards to his wife & to Mollie.
My horse died a few days since, he will be replaced by another shortly, and as there are heaps to choose from I hope to pick one to suit me exactly.  The Macdonalds are very kind to all of you.
What is rain like?   When next we from Australia see and feel the drops of moisture falling from above, every one will leap for very joy.  What is rain?  What is rain???
Dr Darling appears to be an agreeable man.  I met him a few times before leaving N. S. Wales.  My regards to him.

Kitty dear:/ You restless visitor, like unto the Old Man always desiring to get back home.  Glad that you were pleased with my letters dear.
A letter from Buddie dated the 17th March reached me today, it was addressed to London, and was therefore a month late in finding its way to Cairo.  Nevertheless it was welcome.
The Australians fought all right, none better, when they were set against the Turks.   If 200000 Italians now come to their aid at Gallipoli, it may be that in six or eight weeks they will be able to push on to Constantinople.   Let us hope so?If Weston has gone South & you see him, say that I expected a letter from him as he passed through the Suez Canal.You are a brick to stick at the Music so as to play at the concerts at the Town Hall, & at other places.   Hurrah!   Hurrah!!!!  Hurrah my Kitty !!!!!.  [A line of Xs and Os.]
