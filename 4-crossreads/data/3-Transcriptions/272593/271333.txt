<p>19th  Had a bad accident out on parade this morning, every man in the Battalion was supposed to throw a live bomb. C Coy had just finished throwing &amp; D Coy had started  everything went well for a while till by some unlucky accident they struck a bomb which was faulty &amp; just as it left the throwers hand it exploded killing three &amp; wounding 11 more  some of them seriously, the bombing officer Lieut Dingle is as good as dead &amp; Scales a platoon officer is very badly hit, these "Mills" bombs of ours are very small &amp; innocent looking, but they are the deadliest things for their size I know of, this caused a bit of a flutter for a while, &amp; there was a great demand for sticking plaster</p>
