<p>grateful if you would be so kind as to let him have any particulars you think would be of use to him. Also a specimen of "Confused MS".</p>
<p>Am now getting settled here. Work is plentiful, as you can imagine in a new office. I am at the old game of correspondence and suppose it will continue for a few months at any rate.

<p>Yrs sincerely<br/>H. A. Earl</p>
