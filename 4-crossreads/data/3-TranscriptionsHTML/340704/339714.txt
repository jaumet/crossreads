<p>January 1917<br/>Tuesday 9<br/>Arrived at daybreak. Halted for 1 hour whilst LH attacked their outposts. Moved on to scene of battle. Got shelled from Turkish battery. Had to move camels out of range. We then went into action dismounted. Fighting very hot. Our men dropping fast. Got a bullet thro my tunic singlet and cardigan &ndash; just grazed my right shoulder. Arm useless for a while. Company still advancing. Arm got better so I advanced in their track on my own. Plenty bullets flying round caught up to my section. Opened fire at 1100 yds. I was in charge of No.3 Lewis gun. My gunner shot in right arm alongside me. Joined up No 2 gun. Range now 500<br/>fought all day under frontal and enfilading fire. 4 men and 1 officer shot 15 yds away from me. Several of our men wounded . Sgt P K Foster killed. Final sustained attack all along the line and Turks surrendered at 4.45 pm.</p>
