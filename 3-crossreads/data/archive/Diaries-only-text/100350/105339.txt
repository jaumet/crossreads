[September/October 1916]
(30) On the move again. The 4th, 12th 13th Training Battalions were marched from Rollestone Camp to Codford ? distance 15 miles. We were put into Hutswhich were far better`````tents, especially this weather, as our chaps cannot stand too much of the cold stuff. It appears the men from Canada last year lost a large number of men through the severe weather.
October 1st. A Muster Parade of the 12th Training Bn held this morning. I met one of my old comrades Cpl Butler of the 45th Bn late 13th Bn. The majority of the men i9n Camp at present are recent arrivals from Australia, who are finishing their training in England. The weather still very rough here, oceans of mud and rain.
(4) Met my old "Gallipoli" mate Sgt. Major Norm Parsons whom I had not seen for over 12 months, I thought he had been invalided to Australia, my word it was grand to meet ban old chum who had roughed it with you. Again this afternoon I had another surprise, Cpl Parke of my own Company another splendid little fellow who was my chum at "Armentieres" and on the "Somme" in France, and strange to say he came away wounded the same day as myself, it was a grand treat to meet them all again I can assure you.
(7) The Battln out for a route march this morning, went through the village of "Wylie". It is a pretty little village and has some ancient buildings especially the Church, Cpl Parke and myself went through the Church which has some very nice stained glass windows. We also were shown over the "Grist Mill" which is driven by water power.
(8) Church Parade held this morning, very well attended. Met Lieut Kirkwood of my Company who came from France wounded.
(11) My Birthday to day, 32 years of age and still going strong.
