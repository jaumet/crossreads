<p>4 July 1915<br/>Sunday<br/>5th After Trinity</p>
<p>I think the Turks must have been celebrating the glorious Fourth because they kept up a heavy big gun fire all day  &amp;  the best part of the night</p>
<p>1915 July 5<br/>Monday</p>
<p>The 16th Bat left here for Imbro. Is this afternoon in a number of trawlers which were heavily bombarded w/- shrapnel by the Turks.<br/>We hear from some N.Z. artillery men that the cause of all the shelling of our water tanks was an old water cart which looked just like a Howitzer from their position   &amp;  the Turks must have thought the same.</p>
