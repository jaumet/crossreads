  
 Billeted in barn- Improvised sleeping- Leave to Steenwercke in evening. Apr. 7th. Capt. Strachan O.C. of new camp- squad drill & letters   Sudden departure in afternoon.  Strange to say we ride in cars instead of footing it.  "Are we off to the trenches?" (Later) "No!" Apr.8th. Our party take up duties in 2nd. Divisional Baths at Erquinghem- Work in drying room- very trying & oppressive- "French friends."
