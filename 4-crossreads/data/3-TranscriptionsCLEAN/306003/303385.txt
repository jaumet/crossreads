  
 8-6-16 Thurs 8th Heard today that the Russians have scored a victory; also that Lord Kitchener & his staff had gone down on H.M.S. Hampshire & no one saved stiff luck for K. but nobody here thinks it will affect the war much;  received a few remounts today to make up our strength  of horses; 
 A good many men have been caught asleep on duty lately, & Major Granville lined the N.C.O's up today & told us to try to stop it, as the next case brought before him would have to be dealt with harshly;  One night coming back from Qatia our Camel Transport & a guard came right  into camp through the 3rd L.H.R. outposts without being challenged Trench digging progresses & fatigues appear to have no end;  It is reported the Turks have given us 24 hours to move the hospital.
