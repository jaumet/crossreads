31/7/17 Campagne
Woke up early to hear heavy rain and it continued more or less all day. Cancelled the march out to the training ground put in the day on work in the billets. The outlook is very pleasing from a window here the green grass and the grounds full of trees. Had the Q.M. up and threshed out a few matters regarding flare pistols, compasses etc. Our mess room is very nice ? two adjoin. The tables are white clothed and we use all the furniture including the piano. Madame, a parvenu bought the place for 15000 francs and is yet content to get all she can from the soldiers. We are apt rather to forget the convenables? of civilization and men are in no hurry to screen their latrines even when they are in full view of the womenfolk of the house. The same way in swimming some of them are careless unless checked. Went round to see Colonel Duggan at his headquarters. Yesterday they had a great day with the kids at the school and had a prize giving. The village church is of the usual type and all surrounded with graves
