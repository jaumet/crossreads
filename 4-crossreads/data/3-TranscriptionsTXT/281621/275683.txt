 Saturday 3 Tonight I visited Pozieres &amp; had a look over the old ground. Everything is clean and orderly but the graveyard has been greatly augmented. The night is moonlit and the snow still covers the ground. Battery of 9.2 is by our old aid Post. 
 Thursday 8 The weather is still fine but freezing cold and papers say that this is the coldest weather for many years. Fritz shells about us nightly &amp; today about a quarter of a mile up the valley. 
 Friday 9 Leave passes arrive &amp; in the best of spirits. Percy James &amp; I move to D.H.Q. to report. We have to report again at 6pm. Leave has been postponed again &amp; I have to return to the unit very disappointed.
