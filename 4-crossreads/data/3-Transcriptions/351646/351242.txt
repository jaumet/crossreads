<p>Coast of North Queensland<br/>Dear Guy,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.8.14<br/>Just a note to let you know the run of things; are off up coast to rendezvous later with fleet &amp; busily getting ready to scrap a German cruiser who is in between; great excitement just a moment ago as we just sighted a steamer but believe it now to be a North Coast boat. We are in a hell of a state, with woodwork and a boat ditched and bulkheads ready to be shored up &amp; all bright work painted over, rigging frapped down &#151; it&acute;s like a mixture of Marryatt and^the-day-of-the-boat-race sort of thing. By the time you get this I expect you&acute;ll have much much more important news; we can&acute;t get any yet and it makes me uneasy.<br/>So long Sonny, love to all your people<br/>Yours<br/>AlecB. Doyle</p>
