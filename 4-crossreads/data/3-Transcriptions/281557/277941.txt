<p>"scoop out" opposite &amp; we had a good old yarn:</p>
<p>Wednesday Aug 23rd  <br/>Death trap Gully: pulled out about 1am &amp; went with Coy on fatigue to the chalk pits: got lost &amp; finished  up road making near Pozieres: to keep ourselves warm us S.B.s buried some Tommies that were lying about: they were almost skeletons &amp; we got their discs &amp; private things &amp; handed them in: got back at breakfast time: plenty of taubes about &amp; some bosker duals: one taube brought down though under control: taubes were very daring: fell in at 5 pm &amp; marched to the trenches &amp; relieved the 19th : the track was blown in &amp; there were plenty of shells kicking about: made a bit of a scoop out for ourselves: Fritz is only 30 or 40 yards off here &amp; our trenches are pretty new &amp; very narrow: judging by the flares Fritz is all over the place again:</p>
<p>August 24th Thursday<br/>Front line: acted as runner during the night: shells &amp; gas chased us out of our "posi" &amp; we had to go towards the front line: shells rarely get there as it is too close to Fritz's line: C.Bowcher, C Waugh McKinlay &amp; a few others were knocked about by a mortar bomb: a fair few Fritz's can be seen early in the morning sneaking in from the shell holes so he can't be too well dug in: a beautiful view can be had from here &amp; about a nine mile view can be had from one place: in front of us can be seen Martenpuigh on the right &amp; Coercelotte on the left &amp; in the distance can be seen Baupaume: the first two are knocked to pieces &amp; last night our shells sent a store of something sky high &amp; it did flare up some: There does not seem to be too much crops close up to</p>
