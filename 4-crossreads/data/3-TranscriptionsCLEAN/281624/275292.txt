We also hear that some of us are going off for a spell in a few days being divided into classes for those that have never had a spell in the six months.  I belong to this class.  Shaved my mo off to day and getting  a lot of chaff over it.  Next day I excelled myself by cooking a big roast  & potatoes & onions & a big raisin pudding.  Inoculated again against Typhoid. 
 Sunday Nov 7th  I was on sick list all day I thought I was getting attack of Influenza, lay in all day & had a fast.  Received mail to-day of a later date up to Sept 20th.  Wrote home & just posted letters before I received others.  We had two men hit to-day one on our anti-aircraft gun and the other sniped through going out on to forbidden ground, he got shot in the spine and there is little hope for him.  More changes amongst officers  our Brigadier General Chauvel has taken over command of the 1st Bde Inf in place of General Walker wounded.
