<p>Mch 31 big farmhouse about 15 miles from the trenches &amp; 4&frac12; from St Omer. Our possie is a machine shed; damp floor, &amp; little, or no, straw, but one doesn't mind, because the surroundings are beautiful (so different to Egypt)  We went to a small village where the Tommies are billeted, &amp; then marched back here with the old band ahead playing like one thing. Bully-beef, biscuits &amp; jam for brek, but plenty of planes to gaze at, &amp; a couple of nice girls &ndash; (but what are 2 among so many). Secured a tin &amp; a small bucket, &amp; dipped some water out of the pond &amp; got rid of much dirt. Must shave later on. Jolly heavy frost here. All people employed by or serving the Military wear a yellow arm- badge as a distinguishing mark. Hard luck for us; the Tommies got into the Village ahead of us. Harry &amp; I went to the village &amp; made sundry purchases &amp; swigged some wine Beautiful bread, about 5 lbs</p>
