  
 Pal of Mine 
 Ginger wasn't much to look at he was dirty vulgar low But I bet he's a favourite where game dying soldiers go He'd never had no schooling & he'd sell his shirt for wine But I loved him as a brother - lion hearted pal o mine 
 Oftd I see you little comrade as I did that winter's morn your blood flecked lips swearing the old smile ever worn Where the rattle of the rifles & the roar of bursting shell With screams of men hard dying made it all a proper Hell 
 On that grey & cheerless morning the mist wrack all aswirl I kissed you lips old comrade as I've never kissed a girl "Fall in" for you was sounding - the last great trumpets call Your soul "stood to attention" on the field that levels all 
 Well I don't know much of Heaven this harps & halo game Though the Chaplain used to tell us as how a Christian came Who'd save the poor & lowly if they pray'd it to him square Though in hell I am game to meet you little comrade if youre there 
 Yet I sometimes get to thinking in the day beyond the night There's a Heaven home for soldiers who battle for the right The soldier's Hell is No mansland with the star shells overhead & the red moon kind of leering on the battered bloody dead
