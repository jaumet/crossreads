<p>[Transcriber's notes:<br/>HMAS AE1 page 27 - HMAS AE1 (originally known as just AE1) was an E Class submarine of the Royal Australian Navy. She was the first submarine to serve in the RAN, and was lost at sea with all hands near East New Britain, Papua New Guinea on 14 September 1914, after less than seven months in service. The wreck of the submarine has never been found, despite several searches.  AE1 was laid down by Vickers Armstrong in England commissioned into the RAN on 28 February 1914 and reached Sydney from England on 24 May 1914. The submarine was manned by Royal Navy officers with a mixed crew of sailors drawn from the RN and RAN.</p>
<p>Emden page 6 - SMS Emden was a light cruiser of the Imperial German Navy in WW1. It raided Allied shipping in the Indian Ocean early in the war, sinking or capturing thirty Allied merchant vessels and warships before being run aground by her captain to prevent her from sinking, after engaging the more powerful HMAS Sydney at the Battle of Cocos.  Emden was to sail to Cocos Islands and destroy the wireless station on Direction Island, thereby crippling Allied communication in the Indian Ocean.  Emden reached Direction Island on 9 November 1914 and sent a landing party ashore to destroy the station's radio tower and equipment. The British civilians, aware of the past gallant conduct of the Emden's captain and crew, did not resist. Meanwhile the Superintendent of the Eastern Telegraph Company had sent out a general call of a strange warship in the area. HMAS Sydney was dispatched from an Australian troop convoy en route to Colombo and she arrived in about three hours. The Emden spotted the Sydney approaching, left its landing party and engaged HMAS Sydney. Sydney was larger and faster than Emden and outranged her, but still the fight went on for nearly 1&frac12; hours. Emden was struck by over 100 shells and Captain von M&uuml;ller beached Emden on North Keeling Island to avoid sinking. Emden was still flying her battle flag, denoting her intention to continue resistance. A signal requesting surrender was sent, but was not answered. Sydney re-opened fire, causing further casualties before Emden finally struck her colours.</p>

Aorangi was returned to her owners in May 1915, after which she was passed to the British Admiralty. She was sunk as a blockship at Scapa Flow naval base in August 1915. Refloated in 1920, Aorangi remained in merchant service until scrapped in 1925.</p>
<p>HMAS Encounter page 8 - HMAS Encounter was a second-class cruiser operated by the Royal Navy and the RAN. She was built in 1905. Encounter spent the first six years of her career operating with the RN before being transferred to the newly formed RAN. The cruiser became the first RAN ship to fire in anger in WW1 when she bombarded Toma Ridge. She operated in the New Guinea, Fiji-Samoa, and Malaya areas until 1916, then returned to Australian waters. She spent the rest of the war patrolling and escorting convoys around Australia and into the Indian Ocean. In 1919, Encounter evacuated the Administrator of the Northern Territory  following the Darwin Rebellion. Encounter saw further use as a depot ship until being completely decommissioned in 1929. In 1932, the cruiser was scuttled off Sydney.</p>

FANTOME survived the war and in 1920, refitted and with guns removed, she once again resumed service as a survey ship. She served in Australian waters until late 1923. In 1924 the sloop returned to Sydney after completing a survey of the western approaches to Endeavour Strait and the Prince of Wales Channel and was sold and broken up.</p>

Together withHMAS Sydney, Ibuki escorted the ANZACs consisting of 20,000 men and 7,500 horses, and was their only protection Sydney participated in the Battle of Cocos (sinking of the Emden). The commander of the Ibuki wanted the honour of engaging the Emden, unfurled the battle ensign and strapped down the battlecruiser's deck, but despite being a superior ship to Sydney was ordered to stand down and stay with the convoy. This was later celebrated by the RAN as the "samurai spirit of the Ibuki" whenever Imperial Japanese ships visited Australia in subsequent years. After the war, Ibuki fell victim to the Washington Naval Treaty and was sold for scrap on 20 September 1923, after a short service life of only 15 years.</p>

Production of the weapon was funded by a Swedish steel producer and banker (later weapons maker) named Thorsten Nordenfelt.  A plant producing the weapon was set up in England, with sales offices in London, and long demonstrations were conducted at several exhibitions. The weapon was adopted by the British Royal Navy.</p>

At the start of WW1 Warrego was assigned to the Australian force tasked with neutralising German colonies in the region being involved in the capture of Rabaul.
