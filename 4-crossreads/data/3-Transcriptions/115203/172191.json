<p>back to the Batt soon again, I met some of the boy&#39;s and they tell me that Major Wilson was out with a working party when they got him, the boys tried to get at him to bring him in as he had some valuable papers on him but too heavey machine gun&nbsp;fire stared them off they went out for him under dark but the duskey one was there first and the papers were gone, they also tied a string to his leg so that when the body&nbsp;was moved they would feel the pull on the cord and again open fire but our lads know some tricks like that and cut the string first, they got him in alright I&nbsp;was very sorry for him a fine soldier and a fearless one, we have got a boring plant landed for drawing water I hope it will get a better fate than the condensers, the miners had a rude shock last night they run right into a counter mine of the Turks this is a pity as they will have to blow her up with no damage done and all there labours gone for nothing &quot;hard luck&quot; good news here this morning we hear The Russians&nbsp;</p>
