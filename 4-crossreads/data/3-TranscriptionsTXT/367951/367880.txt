 Dear Beat &amp; Family Just a line to let you know i am tip top hoping this note finds you all the same. I have just landed back from church we had the Archbishop of Western Australia preaching to us to day and i was glad when it was over because it was bitter cold he is a very old gentleman but a very plain speaker. Beat you remember me telling you i had my photo taken with the stretcher bearers well we paid him when we left the town and told him to forward them on to us but that was the end of them so i will have to get taken again and send Bertie one. Well Beat it is nearing Christmas and i am sure it is going to be a very miserable one for me but if you and the children just rite and let me know that you have had a jolly high time then that will put new life into me and i am sure there is nothing to stop yourself and the children because it will be warm
