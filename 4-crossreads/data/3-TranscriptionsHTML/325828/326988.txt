<p>18 Endsleigh Gardens<br/>Euston, London.<br/>14th Nov. 1916.<br/>Postscript at top:  My leave expires today week (21-11-16) so that I have 10 clear days in London.</p>
<p>My dearest  Father,<br/>Here I am in London at last, not a dream but in actual reality.  I wrote to you 3 or 4 days ago whilst in Havre waiting for the Channel boat   We crossed that night. (Saturday) leaving about midnight &amp; arriving at Southampton about &frac12; past 8.  Arrived in London about 12 &amp; came straight out to above address which was recommended by a chum who stayed here in July last.  I expect you are wondering what I think of London.  It fairly took me off my feet, &amp; I haven't found them again yet.  Arriving on Sunday I couldn't do very much,- Got to bed soon after 7 &amp; had a complete rest.  Couldn't sleep for a long time, because I couldn't get used to the white sheets &amp; soft mattress<br/>I have only been in London two nights so far &amp; on both occasions it has come up very foggy about 5 o'clock so that by 7 or 8 it is impossible to see a yard in front of you.<br/>Last night I went to see a fine play called Romance which was really a fine drama.</p>
