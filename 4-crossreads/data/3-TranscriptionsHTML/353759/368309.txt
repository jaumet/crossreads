<p>34<br/>Heard from Adelaide the other day, writes she &ndash;<br/>"The last time I saw Betty she and Hazel were arguing about your colors.  Betty said it was Cadburys Chocolate and Hazel Nestles Chocolate."</p>
<p>35<br/>Tony up at the Officers Mess comes out with some weird sayings. Today he wanted the barrow but didn"t know the English word for it.  Tony comes from Egypt.  "Where"s that one wheeled gharry" says he and again he wanted the saw, "Where"s that" &ndash; making motions of sawing "scissors".</p>
<p>36<br/>Bill was at Skin [?] St. on Monday night &amp; had a 'good time" - short though &ndash; he only had my 5F.  The girl gave him a typical photograph of herself elaborately posed as Venus (?).  (I beg her pardon &ndash; Sappho!)  Bill showed it to me today.  "I"m goin" to paint this in a panel when I get 'ome" says Bill, then reminiscently - "To remind me of the pose", ("pose" rolled out neatly).  Then he laughed, "wonder what Eth"ll think of it", silence for a while:  then a laugh and "Hell ain"t it funny!"</p>
<p>37  May 13, 1916<br/>Yesterday I"d got so sick and fed up with Military that I got away from camp at 8 a.m. and with half a loaf of bread and a hunk of cheese and two Books &ndash; Browning and Apollo, made into the mountains behind the camp.  Most of the day I spent on top of one of the minor hills sunbaking and sleeping and reading and then I made down the other side and through a small village where I had a bottle of Beer &amp; got back by a roundabout lane way to the camp:  had a bath and then tea.  Mail of 6 letters, one containing &pound;1 so Military sickness cured for a few days.  On the way back I came through the Chateau grounds next to the camp and had a good look at the two ruined little buildings capping one of the hills.  They are quite undoubtedly very old and quite possibly even 200 years ago built.  One is a small dark vaulted chamber inside a huge Pyramid and the other is quite graceful little Roman summerhouse &ndash; domed ceiling and 4 Porticoes, with long flight of steps leading up and down the hill to it.  This is in very rundown state and only one pediment supported by 4 columns remains.  A long avenue of Poplars, some dead and very grave, one lead to the bottom and along the flight of steps from the Chateau itself to the little building.</p>
<p>38<br/>To take out and re fill a tooth that it took Mr. Thorne about 50 minutes to do, it took our dentist about 5 today.  Some doing eh?</p>
<p>39  May 17, 1916<br/>Since Saturday I"ve received two registered letters each containing P.O. for &pound;1.  To cash the first tried Cooks, then the Marseille P.O. and then a money changing shop in Rue Cannibire.  They put me on to Cox &amp; Co., Bankers who were closed.  On following Monday, cashed it just before going to Aix en Provence with Jefferson.</p>
<p>The trip to Aix was most delightful and of the three churches visited two were most fascinating:  one especially the Cathedral:  there is a strange mixture of Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance work with a built in Temple of Apollo &ndash; used as the Baptistery.  The main altar, and Apse, long windowed and richly decorated after a style strongly suggestive of Saraceni, with its low bath like altar and small ivory Christ on a rosewood crucifix, and</p>
