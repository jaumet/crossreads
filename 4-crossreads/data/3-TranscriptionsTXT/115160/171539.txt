Do have another chocolate.  No you have one - try a caramel, then.  Isn't this a lovely picture "Stella Maris"

Dearest Bess,
I sincerely trust you have not given up hope entirely of ever receiving a note, but at last I deemed it advisable to write you, in order to avoid that catastrophe with which you threatened me.  I would indeed cause me great grief (not to mention to excruciating agony of such a proceedure) to have that threat carried out, especially by my wife (or wives).  I must apologise for running away so soon last Saturday (from the phone) but I was in danger of being mobbed the people waiting, who at various intervals requested me to "write the ---- rest down", "buy the phone", "ring off", "bring my bed" etc.  I hope you enjoyed your little dance on Saturday evening, and that you did not lose your way home - also expect that no late tram was run (12.30 a.m.) when the tramway people heard that I was in camp.  Will have it commissioned again however, as it is
