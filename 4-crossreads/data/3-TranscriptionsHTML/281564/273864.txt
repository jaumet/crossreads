<p>During the evening we descended to Rabaul. This is a very beautiful spot. The town which is larger than H. Is situated on flats along the shore  on which grow tropical trees in which the cocoanuts predominate. The red roofs of villas &amp; bungalows rising in them form a very pretty spectacle. For the background rises a volcano the top of which is brown &amp; bare &amp; the crater cut into a scalloped outline. Vegetation grows to about half way up the cone.</p>
<p>The natives came out to the water's edge in large numbers to witness our approach. Many German residents also came out in white ducks. The police were the first to land &amp; were followed at dusk by the right half company, who are to occupy the outskirts of the town.</p>
<p>At 8 P.M a guard from the "Warrego" brought 22 native prisoners aboard with 7 German officers.<br/>Wrote letters to E, Mother &amp; Con.</p>
