<p>Thursday 6 July 1916<br/>A fine day with a slight drizzle of rain towards evening. Was up at 5.30 for physical drill, &amp; parades were also held in the morning &amp; afternoon. Halfway thro' morning parade had to take a party of men to the Divl. Baths, a fair walk &amp; a rather warm one. Unfortunately was not able to have a bath myself, the division that has taken over the baths not having completed their arrangements.</p>
