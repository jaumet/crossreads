Monday 3 February 1919RafaField Officer on arrival.  Just read a letter from a Colonel's  wife re experience on the transport to Colonels.  Saloon had a fancy dress dinner & in the middle of it a bucket of slops was dropped down the skylight & a hose was put through one of the port holes & half drowned some of the passengers, nice!!!Letter from Mother & Day Dec. 8th - you had just received my first cable saying I was coming end of January.  Papers also arrived, many thanks.The foregoing rather strengthens the Padre's opinion, eh?
