Juillet 27Not much doing. A little drill - general clean-up & [indecipherable] Parade. Expect to leave tomorrow early.
Juillet 28Left Corbie at about 8a.m. & marched to Contay a distance of about 7 miles. Had a trying march as the weather is very warm & we wore steel helmets which were very severe on the head. The road also was very hard on the feet.
