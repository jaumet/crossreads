<p>March 24th<br/>On our arrival here &ndash; Kilo 152 where the 3rd Bgde. were camped &ndash; we were met by two hostile planes which were fortunately beaten off by our guns before they could do any damage.  I believe that yesterday our troops went out to Gaza from Rafa &ndash; which is now the front line &ndash; but I don't know if it is true or not.<br/>We have heard the A.A. guns shooting at hostile planes nearly every morning but they have been a long way off.</p>
<p>March 26th<br/>Great guns booming all day today &ndash; the real attack on Gaza is in progress.<br/>According to what I can hear there are 15000 turks there &amp; we have either two or three Infantry divisions attacking.  The guns we have heard all day today must be the monitors as it is 50 miles away &amp; otherwise we could not hear them.</p>
