 I have never seen men fight and struggl as these men do in order to get there meal . It would be unnecessari if some of the offic would take them in hand and make them form a queue . It is not that there is not plenti of tucker , but more a reaction from all rank against the late militari restraint . An indign meet held by the N.S.W. men . They object to go back on to the ship again , becaus if they do so , they will be quarantin again on reach Sydney . They also make out that the ship is " chatty" . Address by a young offic who explain away the grievanc veri well . Dec. 1st Embark on the " Port Sydney " at three o'clock to-day . In the forenoon the sea was veri rough , but it gradual calm down in the afternoon . We have had a splendid time over in the quarantin station , plenti to eat , noth to do . Dec. 4th Sinc come on board
