<p>March 4, 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Revielle as per usual</p>
<p>Had a trip to Fashn today, nothing much happened  &amp; I got home at 8 tonight.</p>
<p>Another armoured train is taken on the strength this makes three. Aeroplanes report that Senussi are still moving South &amp; they again shelled the planes, when the planes come in sight they immediately break up in small bands &amp; disperse.</p>
<p>Our secret service is pretty complete even out here they have men in all parts of the enemy's country there's supposed to be 1500 Senussi marching on Luxor so that probably explains why we are rumored to be moving.</p>
<p>Nell's birthday today (22) &amp; still I'm not in the position to acknowledge same, turned in at 9.30</p>
