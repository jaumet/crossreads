Capt White (Adj) is getting himself well disliked on board he called the sergeants together yesterday &amp; gave orders that the N.C.O.s are not to mix with the men in Egypt, &amp; everything is much stricter that it was before we went to Gallipoli; He will find the men will not stand too much of it.</p>
