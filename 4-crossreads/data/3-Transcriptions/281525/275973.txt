Their parade ground is on a hillside with copses in the background much reminiscent of the woods of the old Marquise at Flessells [Flesselles], Somme. Made an inspection of the huts with the Orderly Officer and the doctor and was met in the middle by Norman &amp; others. After lunch the afternoon was devoted to company sports and games. The peasants round here put liquid sewage on their fields &ndash; a dreadful stench. Most people here speak quite good English their own language being not dissimilar. Great swank and ceremony tonight at the guard mounting parade. The band sergeant lacks energy &amp; requires constant prodding.</p>
