  
 this shower cooled me down gradually & then we went out & had a plunge in the cold water bath, by this time we were as white as snow & feeling fit for anything from here we went into the hot room again & had a good rub down with a rough towel & then upstairs & onto a couch & covered up here we had to stop until we regained our normal temperatures, when we got dressed, just before we went into the bath I weighed myself stripped & just tipped the scales at 9 st 10 3/4 lbs after coming out I weighed again & I was exactly 1 3/4 lbs lighter that gives you an idea how it pulls one down, we were an hour & a half going through all these processe's, & when it was all over I never felt better in my life, we then walked back to our hotel settled our accounts & made over to the station for our train, we had a fine journey back
