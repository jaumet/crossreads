12 March 1916 SundayCaught the 8.30 A M back again- rode out 15 miles to Camp- all the better for my weekend.Heard that the Infantry 1st & 2nd Divisions are going to France do not allow this to be circulated   and I think we will be left in Egypt for the summer.Saw Doly Wilshire in the Distance- but as I was in a train did not stop.If you do not hear from me for 6 weeks it is because our mail is stopped owing to leakage of information as per above  our outgoing English mail is to be stopped also.
