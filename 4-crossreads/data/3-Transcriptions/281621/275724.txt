<p>Sunday 11<br/>Move by motor bus to Renescure, 7 Kilos east of St Omer. The way lay via Poperinghe, Stienvorde &amp; Cassel &amp; the weather, not being bad, allowed the day to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>Monday 12<br/>Camped at Renescure. A walk to St Omer in the afternoon &amp; a good look over the town. The most interesting part of the place is in L'Abbaye St Bertin which is almost in ruins. Move on again tomorrow, about a 14 miles march. The route lay along Cassel &ndash; St Omer through Arques. Mail, Home, [indecipherable]</p>
<p>Tuesday 13<br/>A great march from Renescure to a village near Duonville on Rolougne-Arras road 30 kilos from the Coast. The day was beautiful &amp; we marched light through Arques along Rte Pab 28, St Omer &ndash; Abbeville to Clity &amp; then to the right to Duonville. About 8 miles. Partly our way lay through the Valley of L'Aa past some chalk quarries. The trees now are losing their foliage it is forming a colour carpet about the bases of the trees. What leaves are still on the trees are beautiful in their Autumn tints<br/>1stly the country agricultural [indecipherable] kilo<br/>2ndly beautiful agricultural country &amp; very hilly</p>
<p>Wednesday 14<br/>In billets at Ecuire near Duonville. A mornings walk along L'Aa to Thiembronne &amp; in the afternoon to Fauquembergue also on the Aa a distance of about 8 kilos. <br/>The country, undulating &amp; terraced is chiefly agricultural growing wheat &amp; sugar beet. The town is a fair size</p>
<p>Friday 16<br/>Nothing of special interest. Move most likely tomorrow in the direction of Bolougne</p>
<p>Saturday 17<br/>No move to-day on account of the inability to find billets. Our officers (some) showed some very gentlemanly conduct last night en route from Bolougne</p>
