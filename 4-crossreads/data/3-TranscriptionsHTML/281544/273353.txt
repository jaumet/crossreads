<p>blown up, my Mate &amp; myself went down to our Eng &amp; what a shock I got, the Road No. 3 alongside of my Coal truck behind my Tender was blown up &amp; about 4 ft of Rail was blown clean away, The Truck was riddled with Shell Splinters &amp; my Tender &amp; Eng was covered in dirt &amp; pieces of sleepers. The Tarpaulin covering the Cab &amp; part of the Tender was full of Dirt &amp; a hole about 1 inch wide by 2 inches long was made by a piece of shell &amp; the piece was lying in the Cab, We had both left the Eng just in time as I mentioned before about the Shell exploding behind me leaving the Eng that what it was &amp; we had a narrow escape. The S. Master went along the roads to see if any further damage <strike>to other</strike> had been done &amp; came back &amp; reported No 2 at the top end had been also blown up. All incoming Trains were cancelled &amp; we did no more work &amp; at Midnight I was releived &amp; was glad to get back to our Camp as my nerves were very bad &amp;</p>
