<p>the party had to carry A frames &amp; etc to the sap where the work is going on the trench is nearly full of water &amp; we have a pump working on her &amp; all men have great big "gum boots which reach nearly to their thighs.  About 11 oclock I thought I would take a run down to the canteen &amp; get some stuff for the boys &amp; myself, so I borrowed one of the 3rd Battalion's mens coat, for each Batt. runs a canteen &amp; they wont serve other Batts you know, &amp; they are easily told by the colours on our tunics, each Bn. having a different color, so we swap coats now &amp; again when we are near one anothers canteens so as we can buy some things, well I put the borrowed tunic on, &amp; forgot to throw my box helmet over my shoulder</p>
