<p>1/3/19 Marcinelle<br/>To the 22nd. this morning and had a yarn there to different ones. Filling in time is a soulkilling job. Took lunch walked down and saw Jack who appears better. Then promenaded a bit further round. Mines all round here &ndash; a busy town. In the evening took a walk round the streets all thronged and electric lit. Crowds of soldiers everywhere. On returning I went round to little Les Turner's billet and found him there and a little flapper of 18. Had some chocolate and a long talk with Madame about all the things the Germans used to do here. Up the street fairly late there was a shooting affray in which two of the notorious "Kelly Gang" were eventually captured.</p>
