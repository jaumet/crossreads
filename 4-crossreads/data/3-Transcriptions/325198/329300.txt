<p>9 May, 1916<br/>Romane [Romani]<br/>We watered our horses at a well at Bir el ahb [Abd] such a scramble it was, our horses were mad for a drink,  I bustled all I could &amp; scored 2&frac12; buckets each for Sams &amp; mine &amp; I think they were much better off than most.  We stopped to fill our water bottles &amp; have a snack of bully &amp; biscuit at Oggeratina [Oghratina] &amp; pushed on to Katia where we gave our horses another bucket or two of water then we made into camp arriving a bit after sun down, horses &amp; man dead beat.  I had to go on picquet &amp; was pleased I did not draw first shift so I could get a couple of hours sleep.  We came back along a main caravan route could see traces of the turks along the way  To-day we saddled up at 1.0 &amp; went across to report to the 5 Reg (24 of us) we met their patrol about 6 miles out.  The sand hill are numerous &amp; we had several stiff climbs.  We dismounted usually &amp; led our horses up.</p>
