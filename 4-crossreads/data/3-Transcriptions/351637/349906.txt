He said that never had plans been so carefully laid and so well carried out and that success was almost within our grasp.  I asked him if it would have been possible to have held onto the crest of Chunuk Bair if the enemy still had his guns on W Hill. He said 'I do not think we could have'.

They only returned them there when the advance failed to develop'. I was surprised at this statement and can hardly confirm it from what I saw myself.

I suppose fresh troubles will come in the future but there is no need to anticipate. We were told to keep ready for further movments which means they are going to have another try at'these positions. They do not stand a Dog's chance now</p>
