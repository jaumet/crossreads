Reveille 6 Church parade 7. Very smart in helmets and new colours. Inspected afterwards with Major Smith. Met Curnow and walked down after breakfast to Moslem cemetery at Zeitoun. Vaults with side entrance all tombs with double tombstones. Infested with vultures.
No move to take place from here now for 10 days Mitchell transferred to Divisional signallers ? a good batman lost. Interviewed several others but not impressed so far.
