  
 July, 1915 Friday 2 Paid all hands yesterday a cheque for 300/-/- in Piastres = 29,250 & seems such a lot of money but L.s.d. goes a very little way in Cairo - 5 P.T. or 1/- for a drink & soldiers call them disasters. I have been lecturing every afternoon lately on Entrenching Supply of ammunition Musketry etc:- I hate it but endeavour to interest the men we are training. Lectures  can  be made interesting & the men you can feel are interested & keen to learn - We are all working hard & trying to do our bit to fit the fresh arrivals for their jobs & keep the Horses in nick.
