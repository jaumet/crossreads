<p>Sunday 1 July [30 June] 1917 [1918]<br/>H.C. 6.20 a.m.  Off morning pass 11-1 p.m.  My window on to the garden is a great joy to me &amp; the aeroplanes sailing over at 3 a.m. are fine, 7 &amp; 8 sometimes fly over in a long string.  Our boys are hungry &amp; food question is bad, they talk of smashing the "bull ring" one day &amp; to prevent that we must fight for food &amp; fight hard.</p>
