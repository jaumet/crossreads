 I have been to London again on Duty.  I had to go with the Sgt. of the Guard to take 10 prisoners up to Lewes Jail near Brighton.  I left the Hospital at 8 a.m. & arrived in London at 1.5 p.m.  We hurried on the Police Motor & had a mad gallop round over Westminster Bridge & past the Houses of Parliament & Abbey along Victoria St. to Victoria Station.  We just caught the train to Brighton.  We had dinner of Bully-beef & Bread & margarine.  We eventually arrived at Lewes & handed over our prisoners at 4 p.m.  We walked back to the Railway, Sgt. 10 Guard & myself.
