Saturday 21st April 1917BapaumeRevielle 5.30am as a few teams have to go out early. Harness cleaning and grooming the rest of the day.
Sunday 22nd April 1917Went out with teams at 9am. Took load of Bombs from dump to dugouts near firing. Very heavy roads mud up to the axles in death trap gully. While waiting to have waggon unloaded went up on parapet to have a look at front line. Only there a few seconds when a whizz-bang landed about 10 ft. away so I came down onto the road again quick and lively.
