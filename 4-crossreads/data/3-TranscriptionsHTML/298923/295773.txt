<p>17 April 1918 Wednesday<br/>In pickle bottles, I have Cyclamen &amp; wild Maidenhair Fern, Iris, Tulips, Lavender, but summer is coming &amp; all are drying up.  Had dinner with the Military Governor a Sergeant Major <strike>[indecipherable] of man but at least</strike> both speak English.  Gold &amp; silver coins are scarce &amp; some of the Jews are very clever at trying to get the former, the Arabs &amp; others never give change say they have not, in fact the first English words many learn are NO CHANGE.</p>
