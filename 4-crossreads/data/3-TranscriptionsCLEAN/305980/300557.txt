  
 18:  Since July 20th we have been saddling up & standing to arms at 3 a.m. each morning when in camp & the men seem to be worn out; the "hats" sending our Bdge to Tel el Makeab at noon today for a well earned rest. 
 23:  After much cleaning of gear, Gen. Chaytor inspected us this morning; irons & bits polished for the occasion; been working on our gear for the last four days & scarcely have a moment to ourselves, so we are enjoying the "spell".  Good camp & fearful rations, these having been reduced 5 per cent as we are not in the firing line. 
 25:  Cholera & T.A.B. inoculations to day, one in either arm.  Lost 7 men to hospital leaving us with four horses to look after.

 4:  Brigade boxing tournament, good nights fun; Bdr. Cox & Ryrie entering ring & challenging one another, but the boys could not induce them to don the gloves. 
 10:  Another inspection by red tabbed artists, Gen. Chauvel inspected; being counted out by the New Zealanders, who had to polish up for the occasion & got fed up with the stunt.  Chauvel is in command of the Desert mounted column.
