  
 Monday 27th I found Chaplains McLean (Pres.) & Blamues (Meth.) both of New Zealand & had lunch with them & as they are leaving soon have secured their Billet.  My kit has gone astray, I have no blankets nor fresh clothes. Found McCook homeless in town & brought him to our Billets & got a room for him next door. 
 Tuesday 28 No sign of my kit.  Went out to trenches today.  It is fairly quiet in the lines during the day.  In the afternoon they shell fairly heavily & at night the machine guns are rattling all night. 
 Wednesday 29th Batt. Hdqts. shifted billets also A & B Coys.  Went out to Transport this afternoon to look for my kit but no sign of it. A Bible Class was held here this evening by N.Z. Chaplains.  It was a very fine meeting. 
 Thursday 30th Went round the Billets to see the men.
