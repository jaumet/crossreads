Thursday 2
Work in morning & part of afternoon.
Down in Wassa again with Kennett in evening.  Infinitely more impressive at night time.
Glad of a day or twos easy time.
The climate is not exceptionally hot but enough so.
Not troubled by insects except a few flies which are very persistent.
Not troubled by glare yet & hope not to be.
Natives are extremely interesting.
Some young Egyptian boys are very well looking youngsters.
