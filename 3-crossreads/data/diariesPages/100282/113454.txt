in about  an hour I had him fixed exactly. I then reported it to Hqrs at 1 oclock in the morning an artillery officer came along took the "bearings", I heard later on that they blew him right out, so for once I done a bit for my country, it appears they had been trying to silence this mortar for some time, but they had been shooting too far to their left.
The land is still horribly wet a chap is constantly getting bogged but the big old gum boots save us a lot our possy the "Elephant" is swimming with water we could neither stand up, lay down, nor sit down, so you can guess what kind of a time we had but still the war goes on.
The Coy is getting in a very bad state this morning we had no less than 16 marked "no duty" 8 "light duty" 1 Hospital, there is far too big a strain placed on the men its time they took a jerry.
