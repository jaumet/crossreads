19.9.15Sun 19thThe despatch rider was wounded to-day but the Turks did not bring him off the horse; Nothing out of the ordinary occurred last night after yesterdays demonstration; but our warboats have been very busy down Achi-baba way &  in the Narrows; Our machine gun men had orders to put in a new machine gun in these trenches yesterday morning & it looked as though it was put there for the demonstration; Last night the two motor lorries took 14 tons of provisions etc around to the left; a railroad is being constructed along the beach & the work is going along at a fine pace, however they are now just on the edge of the danger zone & it is too dangerous to work on it in the day time; The strip of land commanded by the Turks is about 500 yds long right down the beach; Another dip today.
