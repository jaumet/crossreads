7. This pursuit, carried out by the Desert Mounted Corps and those two Divisions of the XXIst Corps, first over the sandhills of the coast, then over the plains of PALESTINE and the foothills, and finally in the rocky mountains of JUDEA, required from all Commanders rapid decisions and powers to adapt their tactics in varying conditions of ground. The troops were called upon to carry out very long marches in the great heat without water, to make attacks on stubborn rearguards without time for reconnaissance, and finally to suffer cold and privation in the mountains.In those great operations Commanders carried out their plans with boldness and determination and the troops of all arms and services responded with a devotion and gallantry beyond praise.
8.  The final operations of the XXth Corps which resulted in the surrender of JERUSALEM were a fitting climax to the efforts of all ranks.The attack skilfully prepared by the G.O.C. XXth Corps and carried out with precision, endurance and gallantry by the troops of the 53rd, 60th and 74th Divisions, over country of extreme difficulty, in wet weather, showed skill in loading and gallantry and determination of a very high order.
9.   Throughout the operation the Royal Flying Corps have rendered valuable assistance to all arms and have obtained complete mastery of the air. The information obtained from contact and reconnaissance patrols has at all times enabled Commanders to deep in close touch with the situation. In the pursuit, they have inflicted severe loss on the enemy; and their artillery co-operation has contributed in no small measure to our victory.
10.  The organisation in rear of the fighting forces enabled those forces to be supplied throughout. All supply and ammunition services and Engineer Services were called upon for great exertions. The response everywhere showed great devotion and high military spirit.
11.  The thorough organisation of the Lines of Communication, and the energy and skill with which all the services adapted themselves to the varying conditions of the operations, ensured the constant mobility of the fighting troops.
12.  The Commander-in-Chief appreciated the admirable conduct of all the transport services and particularly the endurance and loyal service of the Camel Transport Corps.
13. The skill and energy by which the Signal Service was maintained under all conditions reflects the greatest credit to all concerned.
14.  The Medical Service was able to adapt itself to all difficulties of the situation, with the result that the evacuation of wounded and sick was carried out with the least possible hardship and discomfort.
15.  The Veterinary Service worked well throughout, the wastage in animals was conspicuously small considering the distances traversed.16.  The Ordinance Service never failed to meet all demands.
17.  The work of the Egyptian Labour Corps has been of the greatest value in contributing to the rapid advance of the troops and in overcoming the difficulties of the communications.
18.  The Commander-in-Chief desires that his thanks and appreciation of their services be conveyed to all Officers and men of the Force which he had the honour to command.
