Getting a touch of influenza am turning in at 2030 and the trusty Mitchell is bringing a hot rum and milk Will try and sweat it out. Too much sickness in trenches ? wastage of men is awful, Hospitals in Egypt want shaking up to push a few out.
Roused out of bed at 2213 with report from Mackay that two Turks were lying down in front of parapet and wanting to know what to do as they would not respond to "Boo-ri-gler Gel". Told him to use his discretion and turned in again. Believe an interpreter came in afterwards and told them how to come in if they wanted.

Up late for "stand to" and at down went down to beach with Curnow for a swim. Went in off a barge and had a thorough clean up. Climbed back in fine style. Cruiser bombarding enemy's trenches. Changed boots and clothes and put on Ef's socks
Abdul very quiet. Graveyard being improved immensely and well looked after. Good view of Gaba Tepe from beach ? pleasant open country. Suvla Bay full of war ships and cargo boats and all brisk looking. 
Nothing doing this morning. Influenza sending a number to hospital. Japanese bomb gun having a pot ? blowback severe. Artillery getting on to Gun Ridge ? aeroplane spotting.
Crosses some very large marking graves on top of cliff ? many a one elsewhere absolutely forgotten particularly in among dugouts in Wire Gully
