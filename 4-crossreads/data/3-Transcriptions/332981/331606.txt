<p>we will leave in the morning attached to two other engines for Calais, so we proceeded to make ourselves comfortable for the night, and wait events tomorrow.</p>
<p>Thursday 6th</p>
<p>After lunch word came along to prepare the engine and take a train for Calais leaving about 8 pm, so after raising steam, I started to work the pump for the Westinghouse Brake, but found out that the water in the delivery pipe had frozen and steam could not reach the pump, so I had to put some fire in a tin and move it gradually along the pipe to melt the ice.</p>
<p>After a while the steam reached the pump and it gave one movement and stopped. On examining the valve, I found that the reversing piston had broken, due to it being frozen and the sudden rush of steam snapped it, so another delay and as the Depot could not replace the piston, and that there were a bad derailment ahead, I was cancelled for the night and having no brake power on the engine we were held back until after dinner on Friday and was attached to another engine</p>
