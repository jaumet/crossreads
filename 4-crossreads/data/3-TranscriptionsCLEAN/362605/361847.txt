Dad, Mother & George,
March 27 1919
It is 9.30 pm but I am very busy always now & I have to write my letters at any old Hour.  Ellis left me to-day for Details & He should be leaving England in about a month's time.  I shall have to stay on for 4 or 5 months yet but I have taken up Book-Keeping as a Pastime & will be able to fill in the time O.K.  One of us could only be spared & Ellis was chosen by the G.O.C.  It is better for Him too for I am much more contented by nature than He is & He has a Sweetheart & I have not so it is just as well things have turned out as they have.  I am writing to all my other correspondents to tell them not to write to me as I expect to be coming Home anyday.  That is only to put them off writing letters for I am much too busy to write.
I was pleased to hear that Carnivals & Sports are opening up as in pre-war Days.  Things aught to be going in full swing by the time I get Home.  I was amused at Sandys demonstration over the pillow fight.
Mother mentions Black-berry jam.  Marie always gets a bottle of black-berry down for me when I go over.  I never have to ask for it.
I had 14 lovely Days Holiday.  We cycled to Ramsay 4 times & Marie & I went to Douglas to Grandma & Auntie Jennies Home.  Uncle Harry &
