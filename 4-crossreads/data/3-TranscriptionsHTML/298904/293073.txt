<p>about 12 oclock that night we shook the dust of Egypt off our feet &amp; I hope for good for I am sure we all swallowed more than our peck of dirt since we have been in Egypt.<br/>The ride to Alexandria in open trucks was a fairly long &amp; cold one but what cared we so long as we were getting away from the land of the Gyppos "&amp; eggs a cook" crowd. The train ran us right down to the ship &amp; we got out opposite her, on the wharf an old money changer was changing Egyptian money into English &amp; he done a roaring trade with the boys, the ship we had pulled up opposite was the Cunarder (Ivernia 13000 tons)</p>
