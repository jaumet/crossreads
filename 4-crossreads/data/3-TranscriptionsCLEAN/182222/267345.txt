(3)   The Flanders Night                                                    Again we take road & the moon is full. The trees are gone. Only a blackened stump shows here & there. A crater of        few heaps of rubble marks the village; Where the church stood is now a great mine crater . All the earth is pitted and scarred and dead , save for men who move swiftly and warily, and Guns that crunch wherever the eye seeks -- their fan shaped flames spewing across the mud,momemtarily revealing each moment straining sweating shapes like demons of the pit  Along the road we stumble on nameless things -- that the guns have slain yet will not leave in peace. There are no bells. They were melted down & fed to the Guns long ago. There is not even a blade of grass. Only the Guns and we who are their slaves & will soon be their prey. HWP
