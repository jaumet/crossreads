<p>We get orders to shift our belongings off the hill this morning to allow them to terrace it but:-<br/>They left us camped on the road all day   &amp;  all night except while we were working (12/4 am) and never touched it. so decided to shift to more commodious premises</p>

<p>Build a regular bungalow of sticks wp sheets an old blanket  &amp;  some bags<br/>It is very good   &amp;  comfortable but very fragile as the wind a couple of nights later proved<br/>I am not feeling well at all to night not being able to rest   &amp;  a bit feverish</p>
