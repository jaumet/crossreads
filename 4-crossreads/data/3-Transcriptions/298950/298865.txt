<p>as giving you a very good line as to the administration of Internement Camps.  <u>Give the internees deacant food, clothing &amp; living accomodation</u> &amp; the main sources of most troubles &amp; complaints are taken away.  Excergaration is not to my mind necessary to bring succes to a complaint but if you would have to overhear the <u>daily voices of dissatisfaction &amp; discontent as given to every Comp. Com.</u> you would probably see that I hawe only expressed the truth wery mildly.  Clothing issues bring with them allways the necessary arguments but not with the Quatermaster or Camp Representation, who both may not be able to do any more, as they hawe done allready but with the Comp. Com. &amp; amongst the men themselves, for instance one man got a decant pair of boots, the next one a bad pair &amp; as a matter of fact there are boots <u>without proper heels &amp; soles</u> issued daily.  The men compare these articles &amp; the consequences are obvious.  If you issue of course allways brand new &amp; good clothing, this cannot occur &amp; no thoughts of asking for freshe issues befor time can be entertained, &amp; further, why not issue clothing when it is due, instead of keeping so many man waiting at every issue.  There are typewritten Australian stories of Ruhleben Camp in circulation at this Camp.  We too received the bar ground to sleep on when we wher interned.  Who supplied us with chairs or tables?  Who gives the average internee a chance for a hot bad or for hot water for washing clothes?  Do we earn daily for <strike>work</strike></p>
