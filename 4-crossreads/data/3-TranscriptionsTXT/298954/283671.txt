 Sat 24th Aug International Concert. Tellier was a shocking fiasco as a red-clad Mephisto in a "Faust" excerpt:  (He shrilled the Kermesse scene!)   Blue flares flashed around him as he shrieked and the audience (chiefly French) shrieked with delight and pretended to encore him, then shrieking again as he bowed acknowledgements. 
 He thought he made quite a success!   "Spingli", the Italian soubrette, scored as usual.   He (or she) has no voice but has reams of personality. 
 I am to make my debut at the next English Concert &amp; Telliers failure left me outwardly amused but inwardly panic stricken.   Geo. consoled me by saying that he, at any rate, would not join in the shrieks of joy which would accompany my debacle! 
 Sun 25th A huge Gotha flew low over the camp at mid-day. The Holy Trinity posed in it's best rags before old Schroder's merciless machine today. 
 Mon. 26th Another letter from Norm.
