<p>23.7.15<br/>Fri. 23rd.  The expected attack last night proved a false alarm, we stood to arms at 11.45 last night &amp; 2.45 this morning.  A destroyer fired a good many shots &amp; played havoc with the Turks trenches opposite &amp; they could be seen (from our "outpost") building up their trenches all night, the same performance is to be gone through to-night in anticipation of their visit.</p>
<p>24.7.15<br/>Sat. 24th.  Stood to arms twice during the night but nothing happened the Turks used fire shells last night but they can do no damage here, as there is nothing to catch fire, a few blankets caught fire from them last night but their owners soon put them out.  Went for a swim this afternoon over walkers ridge &amp; had a great view of the country from there;  a good many killed &amp; wounded by shrapnel on the beach to-day.</p>
