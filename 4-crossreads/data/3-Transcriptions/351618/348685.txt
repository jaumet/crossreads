<p>I was busy all the day moving Canteen goods to Units.</p>
<p>Wednesday Dec 1st 1915<br/>It was a little warmer to-da &amp; the snow commenced to thaw. The ground which had been frozen hard soon became soft again &amp; although it was previously as dry as it possibly could be from appearances it soon became a quagmire. Wherever there was much traffic it was muddy &amp; soft &amp; where the water lay in any corner it was frozen into ice. The mountains in the far distance Islands of the Aegean Sea looked a picture in the Sun. I was busy issuing out to the various Units again to-day. Went down to Olly</p>
