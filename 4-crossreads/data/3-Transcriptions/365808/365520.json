<p>Public Works Dept., Sydney<br/>3 rd August, 1917.</p>
<p>Dear Judge,<br/>Thankyou very much for sending me the extract from Keith's letter, the extract in itself I think should be comforting to you as showing that Keith is on the road to recovery, his humour showing him to be his same old self.<br/>I enclose a copy of a letter recently received from Bertie which makes reference to Keith, and in other respects may be of interest.</p>
<p>With regards,</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,<br/>[indecipherable]<br/>Mr. Justice Ferguson,<br/>Judges' Chambers,<br/>Supreme Court,<br/>SYDNEY.</p>
