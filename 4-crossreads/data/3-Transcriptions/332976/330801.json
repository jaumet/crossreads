<p>March 1917<br/>2nd.   Our lads took another part of the enemy lines &amp; captured about 13 prisoners, but also lost about half a dozen to the Germans.  Some of the prisoners passed us on their way back this morning.  They were the 8th Bavarians &amp; looked very haggard &amp; worn.  I got into conversation with one of them, &amp; he seemed quite confident that the war would be finished in two months.<br/>I was down in Millerson Post this afternoon &amp; Fritz was shelling it very heavy &amp; had been doing so practically all day.  Our lads suffered a few casualties but nothing to speak of.</p>
