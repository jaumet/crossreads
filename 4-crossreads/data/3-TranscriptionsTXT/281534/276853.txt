 23/2/19 Marcinelle which were animated owing to Sunday. Could not help being struck by the weediness of the youths and the pallor of the girls. One rarely sees a good looking healthy girl like ours at home. The town is dirty due to so much factory smoke and grime. Had afternoon tea at the mess. The evening was spent in the company of first the lady at Major Berth's billet who produced cakes &amp; coffee. Jack came in there &amp; I went along to his place and engulfed some wine and ate more cakes all the while talking about 13 to the dozen with the daughter of the house &amp; her mother. Did not get into bed until late. This suburb full of bricks mortar and unloveliness.
