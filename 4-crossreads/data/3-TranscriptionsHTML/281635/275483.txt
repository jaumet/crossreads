<p>Went into city for 2 hours &amp; had a good feed at a restaurant 4 francs each for dinner &amp; beer. Saw a fine cathedral I think &amp; several ancient buildings. Went to station again at 2pm &amp; train left at 3.30pm &amp; travelled same old route.<br/>9/8/18 Had good sleep on floor of train &amp; arrived at Calais 6am. There saw R.T.O &amp; he told me C.C.S. has left Blendecques &amp; gone down to the Somme, so am going down there this afternoon. Left Calais 2pm &amp; arrived Etaples 5pm &amp; R.T.O there told us to go on to Abbeville. I then happened to meet 3 chaps who had only left C.C.S. yesterday &amp; they told me it was still at Blendecques, so saw RTO again &amp; told him.</p>
