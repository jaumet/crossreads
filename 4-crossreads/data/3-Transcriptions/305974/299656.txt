<p>16 Monday<br/>Today was a beautiful day although rather  sharp wind blowing.  It is very dangerous to strike matches or show a light of any kind outside of a night, if a machine gun isn't played onto the place where the light was, it is a cert that a few shells will come over, so a person can't be too careful.  The airoplanes observing for our artillary causes a lot of annoyance to Fritz, he fires hundreds of shells at them trying to bring them down.</p>
<p>17 Tuesday<br/><strike>We are</strike> it is fairly quiet here now, so we havent much to do.  We have to carry our drinking water from King Alberts "Chateaux" a distance of about 400 yards.  Only the walls of the chateaux remain standing.  Went for a walk to Ypres in the afternoon &amp; had a good look round.  It has been a fairly large city, but now <strike>in places</strike> is in heaps of ruins &amp; in places battered to the ground.</p>
<p>18 Wednesday<br/>Seems very peculiar it always starts to rain about 7 pm every evening &amp; continues throughout the night.  It makes the boards very slippery for us to carry on.  We generally have about six stretcher cases &amp; about the same amount of walking cases every night.  There are a good few 18 pdr guns around us, &amp; when there is a bombardment on, the noise is terrible, you cannot hear yourself talk.</p>
