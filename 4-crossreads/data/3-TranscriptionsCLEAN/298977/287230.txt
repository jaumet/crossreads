-2- 14th May 1916.
on the Peninsular was for 11 weeks separated from the Battalion and we never saw anything of them during that time, but if you should come across any of the originals of the old "D" Coy they might know something of me.  There are not too many of them left now, in fact there are very few originals left in the Battalion.  Over here in France we have nothing to do with the 19th at all as all the Sections of the Battalions have been formed into a Brigade Coy.
Have not seen Charlie as yet.  Have been rather unfortunate in that respect.  I always seem to be in the trenches when he is resting and vice versa.
Mr. Croft must have to work pretty hard now Tom has joined up.  Notice Tom joined a Gun Section.  Must be catching - I only hope he has the luck Harry & I have had all through.
Glad Father went up for a week.  The change should do him good.  Any signs of Billy leaving yet?  He is having a good spell of camp.
Well this is just about the finish this week.  Am still feeling O.K.  In fact ever since I've been in France I've felt better than ever I did, which is saying a lot.
The conditions and tucker here are ever so much better so suppose that is to blame.
Best regards to everyone round about, and love to all at home,
FromYour loving Son,Roy.
