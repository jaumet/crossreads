 Yesterday evening when we were passing Robin Island we could plainly see a large steamer that was stranded on the rocks about 2 months ago. Men are busy salvageing her. She was not far from the Shore & was in an upright position. We also saw just outside the breakwater a large timber steamer, heavily laden & with a tremendous list to port. Her deck cargo had apparently slipped.
