May 22/17 TuesdayDetailed to take over Adeney's team with the C.R.E while he was on leave. I pulled out on Sunday carrying some of their Baggage & also the packs & blankets of the Infantry Fatigue Party - travelling with the 1st Field Coy Engrs. We camped that night at Contalmaison & arrived here at Lavieville las yesterday midday.
The last years Somme Battlefield is well cleared up by the Salvage Parties stacks of shells & empty shell cases, old clothing & equipment being gathered into Stacks at the road side ready to be carted away.
