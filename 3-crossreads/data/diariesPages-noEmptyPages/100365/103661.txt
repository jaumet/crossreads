9.7.16 Sunday
Great Aeroplane activity marks the trend of todays events. There were several German aeroplanes managed to get over our lines today were subjected to a fierce bombardment from our anti aircraft Guns, which chased them. These guns are mounted on fast motor cars they tear along at a great pace, always having the roads cleared for them.One of them flew directly over us, but did no damage, although we did not know the second he would start dropping bombs.There was an intermittent bombardment last night but generally everything was quiet on our Sector.We are under orders to move again shortly proceed to a place not as yet named to stand fast whilst all Units of The Army Corps are mobilized. The Army is known as The Anzac Mobile Army Corps", as its name implies is to be utilized wherever it is needed. This means that we will always be on the go, I am very pleased as it breaks all monotony. Its duties are to be scattered over all parts so you can guess the travelling that we will have to do.The 5th Division marched in to this part of the country a few days ago are relieving the 4th Div. so that we can get away to our pre-arranged destination.The weather is pretty cool but no rain which is a blessing later We have just come
