<p>Oct. 16 Saturday 1915<br/>Working all day<br/>It's always interesting to see the care &amp; attention bestowed upon the Sultan as He travels about. He generally rides about in a motor &amp; right ahead are first to be seen native police on motor bikes clearing the way. All traffic has to pull aside &amp; the people stand on the side walks with raised hats whilst the Sultan passes. Behind the motor are a number of police on bikes guarding the rear &amp; the same in front. He is a very thin faced individual &amp; stares straight ahead. The procession passes so rapidly that one can hardly get a chance of getting a look.</p>
