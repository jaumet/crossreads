<p>Wareham <br/>15.2.17.<br/>Dear Mother<br/>I hope that long ere this reaches you.   You will have quite recovered from the operation, and also that you will be able to have a good rest, do not hesitate to use any of the money I left.  I know that you are banking it, but I would sooner have you spend it on anything you want.   I had Aunt Nellie's letter but I have not answered it yet.  I must try and write to her as soon as possible here things are much the same.   I am training now for Active service again and will be over there for the Spring handicap as the boys call it, there will be some heavy work.    had a letter from Harry yesterday he had not been too well, had a touch of Bronchitis, but was better, said he would very likely be sent to the Signaling School and if he passed stood a chance of Promotion    Also had a very nice a letter from Mrs. Horton.   She is a Dear Little woman and wants to do everything She can for</p>
