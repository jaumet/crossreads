 I heard it all, I heard the whole Harmonious hymn of being roll Up through the chapel of my soul And at the Altar die, And in the awful quiet then Myself I heard, Amen, Amen, Amen I heard me cry! I heard it all and then although I caught my flying senses, Oh A dizzy man was I! I stood and stared:  the sky was lit The sky was stars all over it. I stood I knew not why, Without a wish, without a will, I stood upon that silent hill And stared into the sky until My eyes were blind with stars and still I stared into the sky. 
 "The Bells of Heaven" 
 'Twould ring the bells of Heaven The wildest peal for years, If Parson lost his senses And people came to theirs, And he and they together Knelt down with angry prayers For tarred and shaggy tigers And dancing dogs and bears, And wretched, blind pit ponies, And little hunted hares. 
 Fragments. Reason has moons, but moons not hers Lie mirror'd on her sea, Confounding her astronomers But O! delighting me. 
 God loves an idle rainbow, No less than labouring seas. 
 Babylon - where I go dreaming When I weary of Today, Weary of a world grown grey. 
 Still a few more to read, then I'll use the book as a Christmas card to Mat. 
 51. In the afternoon leave to Poys. with Frank.  An enjoyable afternoon and the town a pretty little place shining in one or two ugly spaces between quaint houses where bombs or shells have exploded.  By the large church more bombs seem to have been dropped than in the other part of the town, and all its windows shew fragments of missing lights. 
 For supper a little of Malaga, some coffee and shortbread, and back to hut billet. 
 No mail today.
