 it has been raining today and it has made the ground very [slipery?] it reminds me of the Black Soil out on the N.W. Plains of New South Wales, particular around Narrabri. You have only to walk about 100 yards and you have 2 ft of mud on your Boots and it is not to pleasant to be carring about with you. The rain Does not look like if it is going to knock off for Some time yet. I hope it Does because it is So uncomfortable to get about in.
