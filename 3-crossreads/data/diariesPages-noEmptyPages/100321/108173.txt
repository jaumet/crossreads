10/2/19 Gourdinne
Cold but sunny. Snow lies thick everywhere but it is not soft under foot now ? it is as hard as a board and the surface again freezing it becomes like iron. Stayed indoors all the morning but did a short promenade after lunch ? the scenery is uninteresting though. At 4 and again at 5 held conferences regarding our forthcoming march and other matters. At mess Abercrombie came in and started his usual fierce arguments. A merry meal was mess as always. Afterwards to my bureau and find that now I have 23rd. as well as my own matters to attend to. The incoming of the ?Time" afforded reading matter enough till 8.30 and I looked in at the Picture YMCA show.
