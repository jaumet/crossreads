<p>rushed for the town where we found kiddies marching about beating tins carrying flags, singing at the top of their voices.  The town was simply crowded &amp; one had his work cut out to work up Fore St., here again great crowds had collected &amp; were singing at the top of their voices "Keep the home fires burning", Rule Brittania, Smile, Smile, Smile &amp; etc., flags were very much in evidence every little kid &amp; girl was sporting a Jack or Stars &amp; Stripes &amp; the whole town was in its gayest mood &amp; fit for anything.  I went out to Plymouth &amp; the same state of affairs were prevailing there, yet in spite of all this there was no official confirmation that the war was over, all they were going on was that the Navy had received a wireless to the effect that the armistice had been signed that afternoon at 3 oclock, but the whole thing turned out to be groundless, if this is a sample of whats going to happen when the war is over there will be some joy.</p>
