there were four pianos, one double keyboard organ a billiard table. Of course I mean in different houses and some most beautiful bronze ornaments worth about 20 each in one house. I would like to have them in my own house. One good thing for us there were plenty of potatoes all the appliances for cooking them too. Needless to say we had a game of billiards tried the pianos too. The second time we were in that village we went along to play billiards again but someone had evidently taken one ball as a souvenier so that's mucked the game up. Of course when fritz started his tricks we ducked down the cellars. Well dear Sis I hope I will soon hear from you again. I had a letter from Aunt Jen the other day. Auntie told me you Noni were well so I get news about you that way. Well dear Sis will close now with fondest love to you Noni Vol from your brother Hal 15526 Pte Vick
