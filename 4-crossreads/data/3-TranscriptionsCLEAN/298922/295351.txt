  
 Thursday 25 January 1917 
 Moved out to  El Burj  & took over Command of B Squadron the old Squadron I had on the Peninsular  as the late Major has been sent back for a mistake he made.  
 [The remainder of the page crossed through]  I am in Order as a Tempy. MAJOR at last, so am not keen to go to Col. Meredith now. 
 However we will see, but I'll wear a Crown while I'm here any way. Received letter from home - Wife & Mrs. Ferran also Papers. 
 Don't put much in Papers about my majority till I tell you it is in Orders, it takes time to come back from the Base.
