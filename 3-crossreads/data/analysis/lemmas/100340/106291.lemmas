 We have an orchestra here needless to say I am in it , that is how it is I have not been up the line again but as we were onli given a month it is over a month sinc I join I suppos I will be sent up at ani time , but then you know that doe n't worri me . Had my photo taken last week so am enclos one for you although they are none too good . I have not got ani fatter over here as I have lost nine kilogramm ( 18 pound ) but I think the scale were out of order for although I have lost weight I 'm sure I have not lost all that . I reckon I have lost about half a stone . Well dear Sis I think that is about all . We had three week of glorious weather but it has broken with a vengeanc today as it is rain a treat . Have you taught Noni to say Uncle Hal yet ? I suppos yosh will soon be old enough to know all about me or will be by the time I get home . Well dear Sis Bill that is about all so will conclud with fond love a big kiss for Noni from your love brother Hal .
