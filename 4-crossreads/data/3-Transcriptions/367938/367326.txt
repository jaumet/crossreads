<p>&ndash; Back here again up on the Post things are very quiet &ndash; they don't think they can attack us &amp; we do not get orders to attack them &ndash; firing &ndash; shelling, bombing &amp; grenading however go on with easy sequence all day &amp; most of the night. All parties seem to be sapping very hard &amp; we can occasionally lob a bomb into the midst of one of their parties.</p>
<p>Writing here is difficult &ndash; &ndash; the seating accomodation is poor &ndash; the position cramped &ndash; the interruptions many &ndash; flies absolutely intolerable &ndash; Heat about 88&deg; &amp; no shade except a blanket roof. Smith the censor <u>Adamant</u> as to time of closing; indigestion &amp; sickishness from food &amp; cramped positions &ndash; weak legs from want of exercise &ndash; brains dull from want of being able to use them. Enough grumbles!</p>
<p>Have written more money to Cairo for rice &ndash; matches &ndash; tobacco &ndash; envelopes &ndash; none to hand yet. &ndash; &ndash; Yr letters very welcome &amp; re-read &ndash; nice reading about you &amp; the kiddies</p>
