 18/11/15 Up cold wet & bleak at stand to.  Does rain always make Turks jumpy?  Carried straight on instead of going back to bed, put on gumboots and went up trenches.

From B8 could see enemy periscopes, two, examining the ground in front.  Evidently very respectful of our snipers as only exposed them for a few seconds.  No other sign of life in their lines. 
 Returning through 23rd lines & was talking to Ward.  Cruisers "Endymion" & "Grafton' change places out here.
