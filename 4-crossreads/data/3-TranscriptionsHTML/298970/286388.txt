<p>9th September (Saturday)</p>
<p>Afternoon off to visit baths at Bac-St.-Maur then a few of us went on to Fort Rompu.  German planes dropped circulars round Estaires for the citizens to read.  Heavy bombardment in the night.</p>

<p>Nothing doing in morning.  In afternoon we had to erect a bell tent and leave the operation tent because it was required for patients.  One of our chaps <strike>chap</strike> was fool enough to sprinkle too much formalin in the tent.  The fumes caused considerable trouble for hours.  Rumours of a big offensive from Ypres to Arras.</p>
