 My dear Father Here I am still in bed - The specialist came up on Wednesday and has said the eye was doing well but I would have to stay in bed for another week. This is a jolly little room - There are only 4 of us in it. One of the chaps Black belongs to Sydney and is an old Newington College boy  - very decent chap - Arnold another fellow - very pleasant boy - he will be leaving shortly - the medical board has put him down as permanently  unfit - One of my tent mates has come here - He has an eye out and deaf in one ear caused
