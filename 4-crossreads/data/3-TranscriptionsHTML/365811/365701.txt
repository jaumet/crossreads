<p>5<br/>casualties.</p>
<p>The "line" or zone of very real [indecipherable] &amp; heavy losses was a belt quite two miles in depth. We had hundreds (speaking literally) of guns knocked out by sheer [indecipherable] bits: it was common for six gun batteries to have 10 guns knocked out &amp; replaced in a fortnight. It was all or nearly all "area" fire: practically no exact shooting by precise observation.</p>
<p>For 36 or 48 hours after each push his shooting was wild &amp; ineffective consequent upon his compulsory shifting of batteries: he shot wide of our tracks &amp; cross roads &amp; of our new battery areas. Then he would come time again. So that the safe time to shift our guns is the day of &amp; the day after the push. That will be done wholesale this year.</p>
<p>They will probably even get to his relaying of batteries <strike>of</strike></p>
