<p>22<br/>It was a beautiful night with a slight breeze blowing in our favor for a gas attack. My Gas Helmet is still hanging up behind the door ready for emergencies. I believe we are to move up closer in a day or so, to morrow perhaps. Another procession in the village this afternoon. The people practically live at the Church on Sundays.</p>
<p>After tea they had a Gramophone going in the Kitchen &amp; played a number of old hymns, Rock of Ages, Lead Kindly Light etc. There were 3 very elderly ladies here &amp; several youngsters &amp; the excitement was intense. How they laughed when Harry Lauder was put on. I stood back &amp; enjoyed the scene. We are just beginning</p>
