<p><u>Ligne-Roquetoire</u></p>
<p>29/3/16</p>
<p>Rumored we are to take over the section from Armentieres to Neuve Chappele, meantime doing routine marches and close order drill. In the village the youngsters we playing eggcap and two girls with delightful complexions are in a small epicurie near the Regtl HQ. Some few flakes of snow fell just after lunch. The little Madame of the farm house after lunch tidied herself and the house up making it look a new pin and herself look very neat with her lovely healthy clean colour.</p>
<p>After the filth of the Sigheadders the nattiness and neatness of the French is delightful. It does seem strange though having the dungheap right in front of the door (it is the same everywhere) and all the drainage of the farmyard running into the small stagnant pool in the corner and smelling. The farmer seems to have a very small place not more than about 30 acres.</p>
<p>A friend came in to visit the lady of the house about teatime and although they do not know a word of English we managed to carry on quite an animated conversation. The little womans husband is away fighting and she has two boys. Asked her if she had any girls and she replied "girl's la guerre!". Such a quiet peaceful place this seems looked at from the distance of a kilometre off.</p>
<p>The Germans advanced to further "sept kilometres" from here at the first. A fair number of the men are drunk tonight on wine old Calhoun &amp; Lucas the cook being bad.</p>
<p>The family circle is pleasant to see after being away so long from one, the 'petit garcons' doing their home work and the women folf reading and chatting.</p>
<p>The latrines of the billets are dug on the French system, just in rear of the stalls &ndash; the niceties of convention do not appear to be much regarded.</p>
