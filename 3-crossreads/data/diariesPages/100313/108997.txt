now about 5 miles down to the South and found another place on the outskirts of Armentieres ? now a ruined and deserted town. The enemy was shelling a place about 500 yards from us, the shelling was constant and the debris dust and smoke of the explosives was filling the air long before the whining screech and ultimate crash reached us. From here we rode home at a gallop to find the 24th. officers beating ours at football. Stewart returned from his school of Instruction and resumed duty. Yarned with Colonel James and gave him some afternoon tea and then got busy with maps and defence schemes. After mess did some routine work and some correspondence and was very cosy in this little room. The sound of merriment by night on account of the fullness of pockets after pay day.
