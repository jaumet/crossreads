<p>Convalescence home until the Hospital ship arrives.&nbsp; About 500 of us are here.&nbsp; I may state that B &amp; B has been the diet all through with an occasional bit of custard.&nbsp; They have one cook here for 500 sick men so you can imagine the rest.&nbsp; Remain here until the 9<sup>th</sup> Nov when we board the Red Cross Ship Dunluce Castle.&nbsp; What a relief to sleep on a spring mattress &amp; oh what joy to get some stew &amp; bread &amp; butter.</p>
<p>11<sup>th</sup> Nov.&nbsp; I arrive at Alexandria &amp; hear that the War is over.&nbsp; We board the Hospital Train at 10 pm &amp; arrive in Portsaid at 8 am 12<sup>th</sup> Nov <s>where</s> just when all the ships in the Harbour have let their whistles loose.</p>
