<p>like a cannary &amp; a very deep voice.  Have to rub greese on every day.  Have had my hair cut with clippers all over.  We go on paraide every morning for about &frac12; an hour.  Have a march about 2 miles twice a week.  See the Dr. every 2, 3 or 4 days acording to how you are.  There is a fair amount to eat, but it is badly run &amp; is dirtier than in most camps.  There has been a good deal of rain.  One night our marque was nearly blown down.  Marched to Rouen one afternoon <strike>to</strike> 3&frac12; miles</p>
