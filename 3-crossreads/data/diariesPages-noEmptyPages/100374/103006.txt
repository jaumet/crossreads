incident is being re-enacted, amongst some other family.

Sept 4th. Tues.
Had a magnificent view of an aerial battle.

Huge German Gotha attacked a small British Scout. It apparently had driven the scout from over the line The scout was no match for the huge German machine which swooped and mounted in its endeavour to gain suitable advantage over the scout. The scout dodge and dodged the Gotha successfully. They were just like a large seagull and a small wren attacking one another.

The pit, pit, pit of machine gun fire was heard continuously The fight took place only a hundred feet above our tents. Just when the Gotha seemed to have got full control of the fight he mounted up into air the majestically and soared away up into the heavens and was lost to view.

We stood and watch this fight, which meant life or death to the fighters, as if we were watching a football match and expecting every minute to see a goal scored. A goal scored in this case meant one of the planes dashing to the ground.

Bob Park paid us a visit to-day.
