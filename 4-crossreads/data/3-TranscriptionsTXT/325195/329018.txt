25.11.15come in with us; They are busy around there digging tunnels in anticipation of a bombardment when the German guns get through to Turkey. The Tunnels are to be lighted with electric lights.  The  2.0.0 worth of vegetables arrived from Imbros this morning. we got mandarines cabbages & some potatoes as our share, we have cabbage for sale tomorrow; Last night we received an order not to fire any rifles, bombs or any other explosives for 48 hours as the Turks believe we are about to evacuate &  we want them to think so to induce them to attack they will find we have not evacuated yet if they do come & today the Turks have had the firing all to themselves & tonight is the quietest I have heard; A Turkish machine gun seems to be a bit merry as it opens out now & then & an occasional rifle shot from the Turks side is all that breaks the silence
