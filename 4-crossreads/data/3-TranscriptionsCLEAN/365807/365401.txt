  
 I do not want to repeat.  It was rather a horror. 
 But the authorities in Melbourne are the limit - and many men will have something to say when we return. 
 Willie Kelly wrote me an awfully nice letter, saying he had heard I had had a row with the powers that be & had gone down to Melbourne & seen Dodds, the Adjutant General. He asked Kelly where I was, & Kelly told him probably in France. Dodds told Kelly that if and when I was in London, I would call on General McAnderson  he would recommend that I be given a Training Bn, at Salisbury and possibly get my old Command back. But I did not call.  I do not trust those cold  footed labour hirelings in Melbourne. 
 Holmes has the 4th Division as you fancied in your letter - & I am glad Keith is his A.D.C. but I havent seen him yet. 
 Will you pass  this on to the others.

 Pretty hot giving Wallace a C.M.G.
