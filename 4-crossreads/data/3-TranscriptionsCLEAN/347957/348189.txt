the train to commence his walk to the border he heard in the first village that he passed that two British officers had just been recaptured.  Had he been a little earlier he would have been able to pilot them across safely.  He gave us a very interesting account of his experiences both in Austria, and while escaping.  Austria was in a far worse econmic condition than her ruler, Germany, and was on the verge of collapse in his opinion.  We began to have visions of a speedy victory for our arms.
The five of us had our Xmas diner together, recalling previous Yule tides we had celebrated, and were all of the opinion that this one was the happiest we had spent anywhere, although still inside of barbed wire.
Outside it was a typical English Post Card Xmas, everything covered in snow, and had been for fourteen days, even the spikes of the barbed wire carried small icicles, so cold was it.
The Dutch Sentry's uniform is of the same color, and very similar to that of Fritz, the only difference being the cap.  He is allowed to go on duty in wooden clogs and wrap up as much as he thinks fit - altogether a very comfortable and independent looking person - so different to the sentries we had been used to, the thin sallow-faced and depressed looking Huns who seemed to have lost all interest in life - that is - until an officer came along when they straightened up and jumped about as if made of springs.  ((Speaking of springs reminds me of the many bikes we saw in Germany without tubes or tires because of the rubber shortage.  Small spiral springs were set all the way round the wheel rim, with another rim outside again. It required, judging by the way Fritz labored at it, five or six more man power that is usual.)
One of our first cards written from Holland was to Miss Chomley, President of the Australian Branch of the Red Cross telling her of our safe arrival in Holland and asking her to retain any letters that might arrive for us till our arrival in "Blighty".  Two days later we received a telegram of congratulations on our success.  Another of my cards I sent to friends in England - friends, and good friends - although I had as yet not seen even a photo of them.  When first captured I wrote to these people asking them to forward my address on to the Red Cross Society.  This they did, packing up a big parcel and sending it straight away.  This was the first I received in Hunland.  My next was from a Lady who had been to the Red Cross Headquarters and got my address and undertook to keep me in parcels while there.  Numerous English people did this, but for us it did not last long, for in December of that year a better system was introduced after two years of war, to provide for every prisoner regular delivery of parcels as by the old way some did not receive anything at all.  Of course, their mates helped them but it was hard for them, very hard indeed, that on parcel nights when others got parcels, they received none.  Our Red Cross parcels which were sent regularly every month contained a very good assortment of conserved goods and sweets.  Then we received information that all private parcels would be discontinued and everything would reach us
