31/10/17 Romeits afternoon pleasure and shopping crowd and from here walked home to the Regina Hotel. After dinner went down past the Quirinal to Pension Boos and towards the Apollo variety hall but did not go into either of them in spite of their vaunted charms. Walked up and down the street watching the people - in the cafes. Theatres and shows do not commence here until 9 or 9.30 and finish after midnight. The gendarmes seem to be always in couples and look as if they have stepped out of a romance of a hundred years ago, wearing their long black capes and their 3 cornered hats. The fountains of Rome seem to be numerous and good and are always playing both by day and by night. Sweet peels of bells ring out from old churches at every hour and the quarters. Until late at night the cries of vendors come from the streets but none can compare with the man with the papers whose "Italia! Italia" is loudest.
