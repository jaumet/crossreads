November 191624th   We are forming a "dump" & I have been put in charge of it.  Material is to be sent here to be carried straight to the trenches, as our "camp" is situated on the corner of the road from Guilemont to Longueval & the "duck walk" track.  (This place is known as "Waterloff Farm")This afternoon we witnessed two German planes being brought down & one of our own.  The weather is beginning to get cold again & a heavy fog came up about 5 PM.We have got news that the 3rd Division have landed in France between the 7th & 13th of this month & are now in action at Fleurbaix.
