with their rifles, we had not long to wait before we spots any amount of them, weren't the boys excited for it is about the first time with the exception of "Pozeries" that we have seen them so distinctly, I got my eye on one chap who was trying to get in, on short rushes, but try as I would I could not clear my sights for it was scarce light enough, I let fly at him 3 times I believe I winged him the last shot, after him I got on to another chap who was right in front of me about 400 yards off him I know for certain I downed for good with my second shot he was too good a thing to miss. While I was after these the rest of my men were busily engaged between them they outed a few for we could see them later on
