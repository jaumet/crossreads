 November 23 only a Picardian peasant &ndash; all her world was in that note &ndash; from some lousy Billet or candle lit dugout. .. I should like to have seen her face&hellip; and his. 
 A Tram straight away to Wimereux &ndash; and a meeting in the tram of Tom Gale:  he expecting an early return to Australia.  A short year has changed and aged him as ten of old whiles. 
 Then to the Caf&eacute; &ndash; and an ordering of Cherry Brandies.. then to the Little Caf&eacute; &ndash; for omelette and 'ot Rolls and Coffee &ndash; but 'ot Rolls were of the past six months ago:  so it was bread and butter&hellip;  That cost us 14 F., last year it would have been 8 at the most.  New faces and people at the souvenir shop.&hellip;the dear little woman of the rich talking has gone&hellip;and ugly efficient shopwomen fill her place.

 To Merridens and a buying of Tagore's Stray Birds, of a sketch book and the "Book of Artimis&hellip; a walk around, coffee and cakes, and a Malaga.. so to the tram, to Pont de Brique.,,  Dinner there, and a trip back along misted roads and faint lines of tree silhouettes.
