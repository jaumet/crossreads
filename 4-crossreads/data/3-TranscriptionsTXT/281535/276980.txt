 28/5/19 London village of PrestonPans &ndash; a dull dirty looking place. Skirting the beach we noticed that all the trees were bent one way and twisted by constant winds. Aberlady was a good village but Dirleton was really good. An old castle, fine spreading trees, a large village green and flower surrounding dwellings earn for it  for  the title of the prettiest village in Scotland. From here an excellent view of the famous Bass Rock which I am glad to have seen and then a quick and pleasant run home in the Colonel's fine car. Passed in fullest view of Arthur's Seat, Salisbury Craigs and the Palace of Holyrood so beautifully placed. Dined well with the Colonel and Audrey and after a walk in their garden we prolonged music and discussions over real Scotch &amp; went to bed at 11 pm.
