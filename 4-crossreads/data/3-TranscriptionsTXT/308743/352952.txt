 Revielle at 5.30 Light horse are now at the bayonets for all they know &amp; reinforcements are up to their eyes in work in the morning I had to go into Cairo first to the Garage &amp; then to the Base Records arriving back at 12.30 for lunch. Chas Cox &amp; myself pull our machines to bits &amp; Charlie's is in an awful state. I got the long looked for photo yesterday from Nell &amp; it's a beaut. Nothing could have pleased me better.
