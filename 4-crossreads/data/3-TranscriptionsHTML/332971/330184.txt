<p>4th letter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexandria<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  27.9.1915<br/>Dears-<br/>I am just beginning to receive letters saying that you are enjoying the news I send out &amp; Mrs Cockburn advises to <u>keep going,</u> so it encourages me, thought it takes up nearly all the spare moments I have, but I must say it is a little bit of <u>love to do</u> it, for you are then constantly in my thoughts.<br/>Sister Burns &amp; I had a delightful afternoon at Abonkir Bay- went for a donkey ride along the bay to the Forts there &amp; back again to the home, part of the way along the surf &amp; watched the most glorious sunset over the Meditteranean.  I don't think I told you that I had spent a week at this delightful place The Sisters convalescent home, after being ill.  I did love it too.  The Home &amp; a house-boat (furnished) which is a &frac14; mile out in the bay- with boats &amp; 12 servants has been a gift during the war time to the Sisters from a Mr. Alderson here, it's grand for a short time here c swimming rowing sailing etc- soon makes one fit for work again.  Abonkir as you know has an historic interest, for it was there that the great battles were fought by Nelson- Bonaparte &amp; Abercrombie.</p>
