<p>June 1916 continued<br/>spent, visiting some of the places of interest &amp; although we did not go beyond a mile &amp; a half from the Strand we spent an enjoyable time &amp; visited the Criterion Theatre ("A Little Bit of Fluff") in the evening.<br/>We got "bushed" when we came out &amp; it took us the best part of an hour to find our way back to the Hotel although it was only a very short distance.  London at night is not very interesting as all the light are heavily shaded &amp; the streets are crowded with people.  Taxi cabs are flying about everywhere &amp; the buzz &amp; hum of the city never seems to stop.  After listening to the orchestra at the Hotel for a while we went to bed about <strike>11</strike> 12.30.   (P.S. "Andy" Fisher visited the Australian troops before we left camp &amp; gave us a hearty welcome.)</p>
