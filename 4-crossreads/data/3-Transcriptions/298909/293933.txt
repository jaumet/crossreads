<p>2.30 pm &ndash; Paraded at 2-30 pm &amp; were dismissed, but still to be readiness to march out.  My old Friend Bill Bedsor came over &amp; dug me out at 3 pm very pleased to see each other &ndash; We pushed off to Cairo &ndash; Visited Native Bazaar &amp; several other places. Had Tea at a very flash place.  After Tea Bill introduced me to some Gypo Friends. The two girls took us for a drive in their Gari all around Cairo &amp; then to their Home at Helliopolis. They spoke very good English &amp; rather enjoyed the evening. Got into camp rather later than regular time.</p>
