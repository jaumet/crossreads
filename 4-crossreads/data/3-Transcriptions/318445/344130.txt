<p>The 5th Brigade retired. But 300 wee left of them, of the 1000 men who went into battle; yet they took 1000 prisoners their own strength &ndash; and they left on the slopes of Mount St  Quentin over 500 enemy corpses, and many hundreds of wounded. When I went over the battlefield a fortnight afterwards, there were all the most gruesome evidence of terrible slaughter. German trenches were filled with German bodies. Human lips and some of their accompanying teeth could be seen plasted to the trench walls. Parts of the scalp, and other members, offended the eyes. Blood had flowed copiously through the trenches; for the bottoms therefore were covered in places, with the life stream, dry and caked. And mingled with all this, were German equipment and their square packs made of hide, from which the animals hair had not been removed. Shattered machine gun posts were very numerous, and could easily be distinguished by the piles of emptied cartridge cases and ammunition belts that were coiled up like venomous serpents.</p>
