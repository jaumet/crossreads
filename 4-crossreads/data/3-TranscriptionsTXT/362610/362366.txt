Tuesday 30 May 1916A dreary wet morning fining up about midday & giving place to a most glorious afternoon. Was up at 4.30, had a snack & then moved out with a fatigue party to the Bombing School : worked at the trenches there until after 8, & then as the steady rain continued, we came back to billets. Changed wet things, had breakfast & was about to snatch 40 winks when the Adjutant came round & stayed chatting for some time.In the afternoon walked over to the town of Estaires to buy a watch in place of mine which I got Lt. Hunter to take over to London for attention. A nice evening walk which I thoroughly enjoyed, taking abt. 1/2 an hour each way. A good deal of aerial activity, the bursting shrapnel looking very pretty. At dark quite a heavy artillery bombardment was started & our artillery retaliated. We all had to stand to arms for a while in anticip. of an attack, but soon after 10 o'c. everything became quiet & we were allowed to stand down.
