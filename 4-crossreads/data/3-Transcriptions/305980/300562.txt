<p>3:  Reached [indecipherable] on the Hebron road at 4 a.m., our section going into action at 6 with "A" &amp; "B" squadron of 1st regt.  We had to advance across a flat, no cover whatever, a distance of 1500 yds. dismounted &amp; carrying our guns &amp; gear.  Many men were lost during the advance, including Mjr. White our leader.  Turks firing from three sides of us &amp; we soon found out we were in a lively quarter.  After rushing the first ridge we halted a while, then going on to another, only 300 yds. from the enemy, who forced us to retire to our first position.  Got the guns into action, losing our officer, Harris, immediately after; &amp; pegged away at the enemy throughout the day.  Orders came through to carry out a bayonet charge, at 4 p.m., but we only had two m. guns &amp; 27 rifles in the line &amp; only one officer &ndash; Mjr. Irwin &ndash; left; three others were killed &amp; four wounded.  Our gun section had 5 wounded &amp; the 1st rgt.16 killed &amp; 27 wounded in two squadrons.  Owing to the fatigued men the charge was cancelled &amp; as well, for they were 20 to 1 against us.  At 3 p.m. the sand carts came up under a hail of lead for the wounded &amp; abdul gave them a lively time; killing seven horses in the wagons &amp; 3 wounded men had to be left in the wagon till dusk, as the enemy were using m.g. fire on it: one of the occupants  receiving  another wound</p>
