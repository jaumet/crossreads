<p>Dear Old Jam-Tin.</p>
<p>We are sitting in front of the fire we have had it for two nights and mum kept two bricks for she wanted to keep the bed worm.  So don't you <strike>want</strike> wish you <strike>where</strike> wore at home so's to keep the bed warm for Mother.  We had dinner at school and tea in front of the fire we never had over tea on the table but down on the flour.  One of our little goats die'd the other night.  Mum is just getting in a temper because Bing and the other dog is making her angry bing is moving and the other dog barking.  It is nice to have a brick in bed with you to keep your feet warm don't you wish you even had a warm brick to keep your cold feet I spose you are very cold over their.  Mr Green-Tree made the stove which I mean a fire.  I think that I soon will have to end this off because it is half past 9.  It is my turn to sleep in my own bed and Frank is sleeping with Mother I sometimes say Mum or Mother which comes to my mind first.  Frank is going to on Monday again he went this week.</p>
<p>Much love<br/>from<br/>Ruth.<br/>xxx etc.<br/>ooo etc.</p>
