 8th.  Miss Nissen &amp; I went to the Hippodrome last night &amp; saw "Nights of Gladness", it is a most ridiculous but amusing thing &amp; I laughed fit to burst myself.  This is a nice cosy little theatre &amp; it was simply packed. A big batch of men marched out for their ship today, everyone is getting more fed up than ever if that could be possible hanging about here quite a number are taking their 73 days here in England.  I have been trying to get back through America but it will cost me too much so its out of the question. A bit of fun here in Camp this morning all the Sgts. were put on guard on account of the shortage of men, &amp; until the funeral party came back we had to carry on. All the bed boards &amp; trestles were called in this afternoon &amp; stored down in the old fort at Ernesettle this is on account of the large number that we are burning for firewood
