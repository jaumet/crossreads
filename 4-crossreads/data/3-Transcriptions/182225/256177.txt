<p>Got Andy Thibaults Maxwell car out &amp; as we only had one blow out on the way we got home about 8.20 AM&nbsp;and gave everybody a great&nbsp;surprise, as we [had?] not let anyone know we were coming home. Linda rested all morning &amp; I was round Hill paddock. We drove round Camerons &amp; Tickles&nbsp;with Cy in spider in the evening. Rang up Chilcott in evening &amp; he was surprised to here I&nbsp;was home.</p>
