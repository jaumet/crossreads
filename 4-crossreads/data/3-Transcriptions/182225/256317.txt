<p>JULY &nbsp; MONDAY 17 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>A warm day but very dull. Capt Campbell took some of us down to watch the heavy artillary firing &nbsp;There were three batteries of 60 pounders practising &nbsp;Was on fatigue in the stables in afternoon, carting dirt to them. I got two parcels in afternoon from Linda, a tobacco pouch &amp; my ring. They are both beauties and I just wanted that pouch. I heard from Mother. She is taking a room in London for a bit.</p>
