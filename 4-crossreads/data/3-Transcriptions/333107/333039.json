<p>Fri. May 19 [17]<br/>The doctor came around this afternoon and made out Donald's and my Papers, so that is one step forward anyhow. The doctor said I was sure to be sent Home as I would not be fit for at least a year. But of course the people at Weymouth have to say the Final word. We hear all sorts of rumours from there. Some say that it is very hard for a Heart case to get thro', and others say it is just as easy.</p>
<p>3 chaps from this ward are going down to Weymouth tomorrow. Had my Papers been made out I would most likely have been going down with them. I won't be long tho' now my papers are made out.</p>

<p>Wrote to Ern Harvey and Mrs Sam Ibbs. Must write Nell and Mother tomorrow.</p>
