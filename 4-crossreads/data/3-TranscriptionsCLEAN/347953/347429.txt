The Stretcher Bearers
The stretcher Bearers were always at hand working day and night unceasingly, accomplishing deeds of heroism and self sacrifice.  Their arrival was always awaited with eager expectation by those who lay wounded & helpless on the battlefield or who lay at the dressing stations longing to be transported to the hospital ships.  Their work was most tiring & monotonous & was invariably accompanied by great danger, from shrapnell when in the gullies  & from rifle & machine gun bullets when in the open but they always carried out their work cheerfully & obediently.  They deserve great praise & high honours for the great benefits &  comforts they bestowed on the weary & worn out wounded and dying.
