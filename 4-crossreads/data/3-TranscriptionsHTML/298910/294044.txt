<p>this evening the Bosh's must have fired at least 1,000 shots inside 2 hours; &amp; they all returned.</p>
<p>Saturday  29/7/16</p>
<p>Nice Sunny day. Only a few casualtys in today, mostly shrapnel wounds in the legs &ndash; Took a run up to "Bac St Muir". Got the loan of some old clothes &amp; a woman in our billet washed my uniform, it was very dirty from gore &amp; trench mud.</p>
<p>30/7/16  Sunday</p>
<p>Very warm &amp; sunny &ndash; Went to 10 am Mass. I tried hard to follow the sermon &ndash; but <u>non compre</u> &ndash; Only got a few casualtys today.</p>
<p>31/7/16  Monday</p>
<p>Warm &amp; sunny &ndash; Had to shift our advanced dressing Station from Eaton Hall to Croix Blanche, as it was getting too hot. A few cases &ndash; mostly from Snipers &amp; accidents. Our aeroplanes doing good work overhead, they seem to have charmed lives as very few of the shots seem to take any effect. Continue to get good reports of the boys down below us at Peronne. At our point South of Armentiers, our lads don't let the Saxons have much sleep.</p>
