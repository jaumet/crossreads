  
 8/8/18 Villers-Bretonneux dugout only 1400 yards from the enemy front line. The 18 pounder battery close to us had a couple of prematures to start with. The blast and fire and hellish din of this barrage give one an idea of what modern war is. Soft flesh and blood has no chance and personal valour is of no avail against merciless machinery. Walking close up under the wall of shells and taking the inevitable "shorts" are our men & Canadians. Further south are 15 French Divisions. A great battle. A few of our wounded and many German prisoners were soon coming down the road and being dexterously ratted by our boys. Stewart acquired a ring from one chap in the twinkling of an eye. Walked over to the battery close by and watched it in action.
