  
 the wagon again, where I clung for 3 hours, minus a hat, which blew off and got lost, and raining hard all the time. We could not find the guns, so the ammunition was taken back to the outskirts of Dickebusch to be taken up next day. As I could not wait till the wagons returned to camp, the officer lent me his horse and I rode to the dressing station at Dickebusch, arriving at 1 a.m. I had my foot bound up and waited till 6.30 a.m. for an ambulance which took me to a hospital at Geddesvelde ?, arriving at 8 a.m. I had an X-ray photo taken of my foot and on Friday afternoon at 4 p.m. left by ambulance and was taken to ambulance train, at which I arrived at 5 p.m. I was on the train till 3 next morning, Saturday, 16/9/17, (Etaples) and took motor ambulance to American hospital at Camiers, arriving at 4 a.m. On 17/9/17, I had my foot and leg, as far as the knee, set in plaster of Paris. On 20/9/17 I left Camiers Hospital for England at 4 a.m., travelled by ambulance to Etaples and from Etaples by train to Calais. A couple of Fritz stretcher bearers carried me on to the boat and, after a short but rough trip, arrived at Dover. I was then put on a train and travelled to Croydon, where I went by motor ambulance to Hospital, arriving at about 10 p.m. This ends for the present my little diary, and I sincerely hope that the war will be over before I see France again.
