  
 accompanied by Capt. Biggwither [Bigg-Wither].  Before leaving Helles I was fortunate in receiving an invitation to lunch from the officers of a Destroyer whose names I have unfortunately forgotten but their light beer is likely to remain a bright souvenir.  It was a very pleasant break and old as I am it was nice to see these hardened youngsters admiring my sketches and in their amateur way really appreciating them.  The tin Lizzie brought us to Kilid Bar in good time and bumped over the road which squirms through gullies and around hills in a way that gives me a reminder of the road from Desert Corps to Jericho.  At K.B. I had food and drink with Bigg-Wither and Hughes, a lively time with a delightful air of farewell & hail and after dinner Hughes and an English Officer also a bone digger otherwise Graves Registration accompanied me to where the others are camped and where I sit at this present writing you and wondering how you are and trying not to feel too much concerned. 
 Our camp tonight you will or may find mentioned in letter Feb. 16th Page 7.
