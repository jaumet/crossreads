4/6/17 Bouzincourt
usual parade ? warm afternoon. Received word that Robinson is to go back to Australia "S.N.L.R" and pushed him off toute de suite. At Mess we had a lecture on Wood Fighting by J. Alderson and very good too. After mess walked for a little in the garden and there met the dear little 8 year old Christian who put up her small face so sweetly to be kissed. In the streets tonight a fair amount of Zig-Zag. It will be a good thing when they do close all the Estaminets. The curses of too much money and too much liquor are heavy on the A.I.F. Billet life is a wretched thing ? what is there for the soldiers to do? Stewart discovered a big bomb dump today with thousands of bombs all evidently abandoned by some D.A.C. It is light these nights until nearly 10 pm ? and here is of course daylight saved. Read in bed until nearly midnight. Stewart out catting one husband returned unexpectedly on leave.
