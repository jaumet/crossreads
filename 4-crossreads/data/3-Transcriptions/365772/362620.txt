<p>My dear Lizzie<br/>I received four letters from you also two from "Little Beres" in two days mail which you sent while we were at sea and which went on to England before coming here which accounts for the delay in reaching us, they were all dated early in November. Dad also sent me two Dave the same and the Mater forwarded about 12 papers and letters, the Clarence papers were welcome. I also got other mail which was very welcome also "you understand". Dad said if I wrote to you he would see the letters so please let him see this and others I send you and he will do the same with his, tell Dad not to worry about me, he said in one his letters that he thinks about me a lot, especially at night he doesn't say much but I know he worries a lot so cheer him up Lizzie dear he is by himself a lot at Bondi you know and he didn't like me coming away.<br/>If I don't write him much it is not that I don't want to I think he knows that and writing to you will kill two birds with the one stone "excuse the expression". I have such a lot to write to and I havn't much time to do it in as I will</p>
