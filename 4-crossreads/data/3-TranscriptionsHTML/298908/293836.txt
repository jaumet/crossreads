<p>6th.  Have had a rotten day first of all the whole crowd were sorted out in alphabetical order on parade &amp; then an officer went round &amp; checked each mans name on the nominal roll.  This took till nearly 12 oclock &amp; then hanged if we did not march down to the Medical hut &amp; went through an inspection for scabies &amp; that other curse, by this time it was nearly 1 oclock &amp; our dinner was at 1.15 &amp; our Coy. had also been detailed to attend the funeral of 2 of our chaps who had just died so straight away after dinner we fell in &amp; marched off as we thought for a mile or two march but Lord bless my soul I never was so sick of anything in my life, we walked mile after mile up hill</p>
