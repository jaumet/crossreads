<p>&amp; sewed on the two Blues of the 13th. Our company are in a big barn, very crowded, &amp; no conveniences. One of our big guns is in a hollow a few hundred yards away, &amp; when it fires at the Germans, our tin roof rattles &amp; shakes as if a German shell had hit us. I have never been in such a cramped space as this barn, there are three layers of bunks, with wire netting str&amp;ched across to lie on, &amp; your own little oblong space is all you have to sleep on &amp; put your equipment, gear, belongings, rifle &amp; &amp;c., but nails in the brick wall are very convenient. It rained today &amp; talk about mud &ndash; its stickiness is beyond belief, you slide &amp; slip &amp; slither, &amp; can scarcely move at all, its so slippery. Swallows perch in the roof of our barn at night. There are some very fine chaps in the battalion, &amp; one notices the fine men of the early units compared to some we have just brought over. I only wish some of my old pals of the 3rd Bn were still alive, I feel as if I could face anything with them. The 13th has done some great work too. Some of the old hands are fed up, as our chaps always hold Fritz &amp; beat him back, then the Tommies let him through, &amp; they are sent elsewhere to tackle him when they should be resting. Thursday 18 April<br/>Parade in fighting order. It was windy &amp; wet &amp; very cold, did a little physical &amp; bayonet drill. Came in at 11.30, &amp; the 13th</p>
