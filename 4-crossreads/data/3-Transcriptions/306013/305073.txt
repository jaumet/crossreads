<p>the snow was very hard work &amp; included marching in line, turnings, forming fours etc. Our day's work also includes one hour's solid physical training which proves very solid, but nevertheless must be very good for us. We were quite worked to a standstill &amp; were glad when tea-time came. Y.M.C.A. hut in Evening gave us warmth &amp; comfort.</p>
<p>Feb. 7. Porridge for breakfast quite reminded one of olden times. Same drill as yesterday but including slow-marching which is something after the style of the German goose-step. We were 'dead-beat' by end of day but spent a nice evening in the C.E. hut &amp; ended up with a hot-shower &amp; an early bed.</p>
<p>Feb. 8. Full day's drill except 1 hour off for pay. We received &pound;4 only &amp; out of this was deducted 11/1 for fare to Birmingham at reduced rates. An old debt of 10/- raised my funds by half that amount, the other 5/- going to Alan.</p>
