[Transcriber's note:  This is the fourth diary of Alfred Morris who is serving with Australian Light Horse Field Ambulance in the Sinai Peninsula.  During October he describes in detail the battle to capture Maghara, the difficulties of the terrain, his duties caring for the wounded and the return to camp near the Suez Canal.  In January 1917 he applies to return to Australia on a hospital ship as his father is very ill.  He sailed on the Euripides on 22 January and works in the dispensary and caring for the sick in the ship's hospital.  He disembarks at Woolloomooloo Wharf on 21 February and then goes by train to Melbourne, finally arriving home in time to be with his father.]
