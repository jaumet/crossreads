<p>9 in. Naval and 75s, make a small noise when they are all firing.  Two of our chaps went into Villers Bretoneux on a foraging expedition and brought back Cardigans, Ladies stockings, Scarves and reels of cotton.</p>
<p>Thursday May 9th<br/>Didn't get up until 8 a.m. put in the day on the dugout, making it shrapnel proof.  I got paid 40 Francs (&pound;1-9-4) my first pay in the field.  11-30 p.m. had to go on Gas and S.O.S. Guard until 1 a.m.  The sky was lit up with Star shells and the flashes of the guns and bursting shells.  The shells passing overhead sounded like the rush of a train intermingled with the rattle of rifles and machine guns, and through it all could be hard the whistling of some night birds.</p>
<p>Friday May 10th<br/>Digging holes all day.  The weather for the last 3 days has been "Tray Bon".  Two of our chaps went into Villers Bretoneux again and brought back a motley collection of goods (a clock, a chair, ink etc.).</p>
<p>Saturday May 11th<br/>My turn to do the cooking for the centre section.  for breakfast I fried bacon and bread, Dinner, roast beef, stewed figs and rice, Tea, bully beef stew, which I spoiled through putting too much salt into it.  Supper, Cocoa and milk.  Fritz shelled the gully to the right of our battery, but did no damage.</p>
<p>Sunday May 12th<br/>Had an easy day.  9 p.m. had to go on S.O.S. till 10.30.  Fritz had two searchlights on the go.  (He must have had the wind up.)</p>
