  
 Monday 21 February, 1916 
 We have been living on the fat of the land for the last six days, what with our canteen stuff & the comfort fund we have had a high old time but all our good things have gone now I finished my last tin of fish today. 
 Lieut Hamilton came back to the section today, he is fatter than ever. 
 Was mess orderly today.
