After dinner which was also successful, went for tram rides through & around the city. City & suburbs from a distance looks very fine & impressive. Some tram rides we took was Unigeni, Musgrave Road, Marine Parade etc. Had afternoon tea & bright evening with some nice friends we have made. Had tea at the beach, Bill Martin, Tom Scott & myself, and a nice tea it was too and quite shrewd. In the day I had my first Ricksha ride.
