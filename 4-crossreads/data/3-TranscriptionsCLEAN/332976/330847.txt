  
 April 1917 24th   We had the usual inspections this morning & drill (rifle exersise) until dinner time.   This afternoon with  four  five others I went down to where the sports are to be held to-morrow to complete preparations which  have  are being made there. 25th   Anzac Day-  after hut inspection we were free for the rest of the day.  The Anzac Sports started soon after dinner on a flat where an oval has been prepared, & practically the whole of the 15th Brigade were there.   It was a very successful turn-out & finished about 5 P.M.   General Birdwood & Brigadier Generals Hobbs & Elliott ("Pompie") were present as well as numerous other staff officers.
