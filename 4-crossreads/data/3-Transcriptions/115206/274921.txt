<p>December  1918.<br/>Thursday 19</p>
<p>At Sea. H.S."Karoola."<br/>Weather fine and warm. Saw a most beautiful moonlight scene and a magnificent sunset today.<br/>The old "hooker" is busy grinding out her 15 miles per hour and had travelled another 345 miles since last night.<br/>The sea today is helping her along a great deal, and she has the benefit of a nice 4 knot breeze.<br/>Play Auction Bridge discussed Egypt and wrote letters. Stores still holding good.</p>
