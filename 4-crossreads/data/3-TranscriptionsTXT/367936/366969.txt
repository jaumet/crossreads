 Wednesday 26 April 1916 Received No. 2480 All of us (17th Reinforcements) up at 4 a.m. and left camp by train.  Marched through Sydney with band to transport in Wooloomooloo [Woolloomooloo].  Mardie, Lorna, Cath, Geoff, Alan &amp; Charley marched with me from station.  Vida managed to get down just as boat was leaving &amp; I was able to say Goodbye.  We put out into the stream about 10 o'clock, were payed and left at noon.  I wrote to Mother.  A beautifully calm day.  This boat is A39 "Port Macquarie".  We have 360 Artillery horses &amp; 89 men.  Will have a good bit of work but there is tons of room for the men which is nice. 
 Thursday 27 April 1916 Heavy swell and a head wind today.  Most of the men sea sick.  It keeps us going all day to look after the horses.  No time for any drill.  Had five horses alloted to me but realy have about 10 to fix up.
