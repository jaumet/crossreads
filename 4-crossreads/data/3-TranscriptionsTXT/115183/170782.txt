Consequently the next morning after an early breakfast and farewells to my kind host and hostess, I caught an East Coast train shortly after 8 am.
The trip lay first through flat agricultural country down to the sea coast and then over hilly timbered country for some distance. Thence it lay down to the Trent crossing that wide river at Tweedmouth by a massive stone arched bridge called Berwick Bridge, this bridge lies on the border between Berwich in Scotland and Tweedmouth in Eng.
From here on the journey lay for the first part along the sea cliffs and further inland across great stretches of moorland cultivated except where too low-lying. Long hairy fleeced sheep could be noticed but in fairly small numbers
