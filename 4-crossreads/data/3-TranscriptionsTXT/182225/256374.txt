 1916 &nbsp; TUESDAY 12 &nbsp; SEPT. 
 Fine but cloudy. Out with battery headquarters all day, as a telephonist. Its not much of a job as there&nbsp;is nothing to do. Got letters from Linda, Father &amp; Jo. We played the 26 th &nbsp;Battery 2 nd &nbsp;team &amp; beat them by 9 to 8, after a hard even game. I enjoyed the game very much.
