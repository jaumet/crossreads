  
 Hdqrs have one shell come over & caught a few in the sandbagged passage that leads to the tunnels entrance &  killed 10 &  wounded 7. Not a bad tally for a small shell of only a few pounds weight but it happened to catch them in an enclosed space. Sgt. Garvey had the bad luck to get killed. Geo. Harris badly wounded. 
 Sat. Jan. 6th Went back to "Goodwin's Post" again tonight for another 24 hours. We are absolutely done up with the hardship    but we have one consolation this road is absolutely "Alive with dead Fritzs" - all of them are "stale Goods"
