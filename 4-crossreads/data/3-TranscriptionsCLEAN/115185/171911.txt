4 - much I shall tell you but can't write. I wonder if you have seen Col. Dick. I believe he arrives in Sydney today. I have not had letters from you for a month at least - and long for news. Lawrence has not written since - the day before I left Sydney 14 May. But I saw him in a group of Lieut training at no 2 officers school in Sydney. I wonder if we shall meet out here?I love your letters dearest Mother & Father too. I shall write him a letter tomorrow night about money - devoted love to you both. I hope you are well. I know what a fearful strain this time is for you both - so far away from us here in the centre of danger. The girls & Gibson & myself - But think we'll come through alright - and then your worries at home. Oh Mother, I do wish I could help more. I'll soon be able to pay my debt to Dad however that'll be one relief.Your daughter Betha
