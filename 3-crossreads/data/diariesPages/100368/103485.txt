As we came out of the shelter after the service, shrapnel burst over our heads and spread into the sea near the "Milo". Had a parade of all men and received orders how to proceed during the evacuation. The unit has been divided into four parties. No 4 party is to leave the shelter first, No 3 next No 2 to follow and No 1 last. D. and myself are in No 2 party. Bingham who is being evacuated sick is taking a letter which he is going to post to George, so tha if I am missing the people at home will know that I am a prisoner of war in Turkey. We have been addressed by Major Campbell our new O.C. and the tone of his address gave us confidence that we would get off all right.

Dec 19th Sun.
On water tank guard, I saw no troops during the night but I am told that ten thousand had left Anzac Cove pier during the nightime. Shrapnel was sent over during the night-time. The "Stores" fire still burns fiercely.
