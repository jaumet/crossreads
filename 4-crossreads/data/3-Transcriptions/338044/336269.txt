<p>done up, right off colour. The reaction of the worry in trying to get to the front    &amp; hatred of the indoor work. Can't last much longer. After tea, spend the evening at home</p>
<p>13th September:- Wednesday<br/>Finances running low &amp; hard job to make ends meet until Pay Day. Return bottles etc used in birthday orgie to Caf&eacute; des Fleurs &amp; obtain two francs to replenish our pockets. Weighed 65 kilograms in Jardin des Plantes (= 10 stone 3 lbs) on Sunday.

<p>14th Sept:- Thursday<br/>Cooper still here in hospital &amp; does not intend to leave. Has my letter still. Write again to Capt Wooster &amp; shall post it to-morrow  Bitterly cold wind blowing all day</p>
