the best Division in France today.
   High praise I know but with all modesty I can say that it is true; of course any Australian Division would have done this but we were fortunately the first on the spot & that too is part of the excellent work for our Artillery worked by forced marches of 30 miles per day, went into action only a few hours after the infantry & moved up with us several thousand yards in the first day night.
   It has meant hard work for us all. It has meant much danger too but comparatively speaking our casualties have been light & though others h who have shown to the enemy a front less bold, who were less daring in their seizure of positions of vantage, have paid heavily, our cost has been much less because of our strength.
   Some day I'll write of incidents in this eventful career of ours, but just at present am too busy for any lengthy epistles.  So I'll shut off now with every jolly good wish.
   With all Love & Best Love
      Your Harold
