<p>[?]oover, I at once - much to his surprise and wonderment - congratulated him on his narrow escape.&nbsp; On his asking the reasons for my congratulations, I told him that but for one letter he would have been born a drunkard.&nbsp; He did not seem to at&nbsp;all appreciate my joke at his expense, and I was a bit afraid that he would retaliate by some action which would make me look more foolish if possible than nature had already made me.&nbsp; However, unlike things now-a-days, the matter was fixed up quite satisfactorily and there was no &quot;strike&quot;.</p>
