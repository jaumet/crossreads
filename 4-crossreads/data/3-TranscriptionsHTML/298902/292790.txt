<p>9.<br/>which I bussed it to Gt Smith St to see Geo Say if possible.  He was out but managed to get his address so took a tube out to Kensington, after some trouble I managed to find it but he was out, but the people insisted on me coming in &amp; then gave me a slapup tea.  Left here at 9 after a pleasant evening &amp; returned to the hotel.  I posted two letters, 2 minutes later I realised that I had forgotten to put stamps on them so went back at 11 oclock when the box was cleared.  Raining most of the day &amp; rather depressing.</p>
<p>Friday 29th Nov  Went out to Kensington to meet Geo Say before he left but just missed him so returned to town &amp; met him at 1 oclock at his office.  Then had lunch together in Piccadilly, later booking seats for Chin Chin Chow.  He then did some business whilst I ran out to South Kensington to get my uniform which I had left there on my last leave.</p>
