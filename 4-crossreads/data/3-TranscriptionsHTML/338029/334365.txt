<p>met part of the 11th.  They inf. me that they were relieving us to-morrow and we were off to Megiebrah.  I had to walk home from Railhead no horse to meet me, arrived home 7 p.m. tired, found A.M.C. all packed up ready to start at 8 p.m.  I have to ride, but the others will go by barge on the canal to El Ferdan.</p>
<p>Sunday 24th Sept.<br/>Rev. 4.30, all A.M.C. goods on roadway ready for barge, doctor &amp; I left with the main body at 8 p.m., poor old Zigi heavily loaded.  General Ward took the salute as we marched past, good trip all the nine miles to Ferry Post R.Hd. where we fed up, very friendly the Sgts. of the 4th Welsh invited us to dinner, we had a great two hrs,  then we saddled again and rode 7 miles further on to El Ferdan R. Hd., where we bivouaced, here we stayed with 11th Sgts. Mess, did sick parade.</p>
<p>Monday 25th Sept.<br/>In the saddle again at 5 p.m., trekked over heavy country to a well called Mahadit, had lunch &amp; fed, then pushed on another nine miles to a beautiful date palmed oasis called Barda, here we found part of B Squad, who have been out a month.  The trees are laden with ripe dates &amp; afford a lovely shade, but the camp itself is a death trap if we were attacked and it is quite possible, as yesterday</p>
