Great rumours are knocking about since yesterday.  It is said that the German Fleet is out and all arrangements are in hand lest there should be an attempted invasion by the Germans.  It seems a very harem scarem idea, all the same.  There is talk of a general mobilisation, but one can't get the "dinkim oil" about things.  There was also talk of a revolution in Ireland again, but the newspapers say nothing about it.  All leave is cancelled until further notice.  This included the 4 days' Disembarkation leave, and nearly [indescipherable] from this [indescipherable] after all arrangements had been made.  They say that the big ship-building yards in Scotland are on strike too.  It is certain, however, that something is on foot, in one direction or another.  We read the head man (Newton Moore) of the A.I.F. had a flying visit yesterday.  These are for 8 troopships just about to arrive this week sometime; they have been hung up somewhere.  Germany, according to Lloyd's Weekly, was almost on the brink of revolution, and much talk of a similar situation as has arisen in Russia by eliminating monarchy and bureaucracy.
I could not get the Times yesterday, but am forwarding a few papers.  Is Bess trying over the bits of music I'm sending over?  There is another fiddler in the office, & we were having a tune last night where we were visited by the Heads & compliments.
Gee Whiz, the March winds are going strong today.  They reckon Salisbury Plain is the coldest and bleakest spot in England.  Some of the countrypeople reckon this winter is the worst in their ken.  And still it continues.
Well, dear Dad, there's nothing more to say at present.  With fondest hopes that you are all well.
Best love from
James
