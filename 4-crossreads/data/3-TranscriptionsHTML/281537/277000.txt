<p>30/8/15  Alexandria<br/>are mounted with their crews standing by and guards with ball cartridge are also mounted.</p>
<p>31/8/15<br/>A fairly good roll has made a good many sick.  Beautiful blue skies and a cool breeze.  Boat drill 11 am with all hands standing at stations.  We need more practice in this as too many did not know where to go.  Remember a funny event at Heliopolis as we were leaving.  As head of column passed the Market a native woman came towards us with her head down pushing a cart of sukkar melons.  As soon as she saw us she gave an agonised shriek and fled down a side street as hard as she could.  Experience teaches these folk to take no risks when a tired or thirsty crowd like ours is on the march.  We have a crowd of English officers aboard and some got very boozed at the bar tonight and retired helpless.</p>
