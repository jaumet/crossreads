<p>been accustomed to look at in the North as we used to look at the dear old Cross in the South.  While this was happening a Field Gun was hurling shells close over our head into the Turkish lines in amongst the very people who have done so much against Christianity which St. Paul did so much to establish.</p>
<p>14th<br/>A fairly quiet day although there was a fair amount of Artillery fire from both sides.</p>
<p>15th<br/>Rather heavy Artillery duel between our guns &amp; Turks at "Cape Helles" a tremendous bombardment by our boats is going on.  From 8 p.m. to midnight could be heard a continuous rattle of rifle &amp; machine gun fire.  Rumoured that our Forces down south making good progress.</p>
<p>16th<br/>Rumoured today that the British &amp; French at Cape Helles made good progress yesterday.  No official confirmation.  Things quiet here.</p>
<p>17.6.15<br/>Nothing fresh to write.  Battle still progressing as usual.</p>
<p>18th<br/>Light Artillery &amp; rifle fire on both sides nothing fresh.</p>
<p>19th<br/>Same as yesterday.</p>
<p>20th<br/>Nothing fresh.  Same energetic work going on, sapping &amp; driving toward Enemies lines.</p>
<p>21st<br/>Little artillery &amp; rifle fire during day.  About 10.30 p.m. we opened with heavy rifle fire &amp; bombs all along the line to which the Turks vigorously replied.  Our fire had been to find out their relative strength at different points along the firing line and it worked well.</p>
<p>22nd<br/>Principle work being done driving tunnels in front firing line to form new fire trench.  When this is complete we should have a very strong position, much stronger than we have at present. Other things as usual.</p>
<p>23rd<br/>Same performance as usual, sapping.  Artillery and rifle fire.  Nothing fresh.</p>
