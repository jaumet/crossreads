<p>Flessells 14/12/16  Marched out again to Haystack Hill and carried out a Brigade attack with three battalions in the line, acting as umpire with Colonel Forbes and Maberly Smith.  We had an aeroplane out with us and carried out some good communication with him by means of the ground sheets.  All our messages reached him.  The airman was a sport and responded in morse on his Claxton horn to a cheerfully obscene message sent him by our signallers.  After the operation was complete we had a conference of the officers and the umpires and the Brigadier spoke.  From this open country it was rather striking to notice how the church steeples in the villages dominate the country surrounding and how useful they are as O.P's.  Marched back as a Brigade and the afternoon was spent as a half holiday.  At 4 pm went round the Brigade Mess at the Chateau and there met General Legge and had afternoon tea.  He spoke on the scheme for training our reinforcement drafts and on other matters being extremely adverse to our men wearing the golden Anzac [indecipherable] saying other people could wear peacocks feathers if they wished in a place rather suitable for hot weather fashions.  The hard life here is rough on poor old patriotic devils over 40 who have enlisted.  They can't stand the life.  One of them who has been off colour for some days dropped dead today in their billets.  Dark very early cold and raining.  The village streets quite dark the candlelight from the billets comes streaming out through the crevices.  360 pairs of boots came today and not before they are needed and about the same number of blankets also turned up.  At B.H.Q. met the little airman who worked with us this morning &ndash; a decent little chap with a good sense of humour.  Bed midnight.</p>
