Left Folkstone at 3PM. and a calm trip across arrived at Boulogne in very low spirits. These few remaining spirits were entirely wasted away as on our way to Rest Camp we were wet through to the skin in 5 minutes by a very heavy downpour
Left same night at 9.30PM and arrived at Albert at 5AM and after 12 miles tramp found my unit where I left them
June 22nd - 17Well here I am trying my hardest to get into the way of military life again after such a fine holiday which has been beneficial
