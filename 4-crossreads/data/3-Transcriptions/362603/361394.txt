<p>Bulford<br/>6.3.17<br/>Dear Mum, Dad &amp; George,<br/>We are very busy just now but I have just time enough to answer Your letters to-night &amp; catch tomorrows mail.  I have Your letters of X'mas Day New Years Eve, &amp; 7.1.17.<br/>You give me a shock when You ask me not to write to anymore Girls that I have not seen.  I do not remember doing such a thing.  I keep a record of all the letters that I write &amp; do not see any record of a stranger.  I may be going mad &amp; have done such a thing, but don't say anything to the People.  Let me know the name &amp; address &amp; I will be able to tell you then.  You say do not worry but I am very concerned.  I must have written, as You say so, but let me Know who the Party is.  I wrote to Miss Ninnes, but Dave says it could not be His Pa &amp; Ma that roused.  Who the devil is it?  I can't think.<br/>We have had pretty fair weather lately.  Billy was over on Sunday &amp; I went out for a couple of Hours with Him.  He is well &amp; likes His new job very much.  March winds are on us &amp; they are just like our Westerlies, no colder though.  One soons gets used to this climate.  My word the Fruit trees are doing well.  We aught to have some good feeds off them by the time we return.</p>
