 My darling Eddy, 
 I wonder what Santa gave you this year. Suppose you are having a very Happy Holiday now. We had a great day with our poor wounded soldiers. They all had plenty of good things to eat   &amp;  drink. 
 We were very busy with preparing the decorations all last week   &amp;  then started to put them up on Sunday. 
 Heaps of love   &amp;  kisses 
 From XOXOXOXOXO Auntie Eadle
