 huge rest camp , and be suitabl situat for rail transport , the sandhil form an ideal camp ground . After noon I ran up to Gaza . I had a much better opportun of look over the ruin than on my previous visit . Scarc a build remain intact and those not destroy by the Turk for their timber ( which were use to reinforc trench ) were demolish by our bombard . The town is absolut desert and an oppress quiet rule over the ruin . The failur to captur Gaza dure the first two battl is attribut by all to the tactic of the then G.O.C. , Gener Murray , who conduct both engag from Cairo! In the first battl the New Zealand were actual in the street of Gaza when they receiv the order - no one know why- to withdraw ! The enemi were appar under similar intent .
