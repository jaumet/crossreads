<p>9/8/19 Durban<br/>there are a few household utensils to be seen and the whole of the family sitting round in varying stages of dirt &amp; nakedness. There is usually a baby or two. The children are all stark naked and have pop bellies all swollen out through stuffing themselves with mealies. The women are unkempt and dirty, their breasts flopping about. Usually they hid these with a blanket but one woman threw her blanket away &amp; posed for a photograph for 1/ and would have disrobed entirely for 2/6. Generally they showed a good idea of the value of money. Saw an old man with heart &amp; kidney disease lying in a hut of his own sick. The women carry the babies on their backs where the kids sleep comfortably. Most natives seem to have a couple of wives however poor they seem.</p>
