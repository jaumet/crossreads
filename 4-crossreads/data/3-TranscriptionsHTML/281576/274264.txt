<p>At the Base</p>
<p>Wed. Aug. 22nd   Weather still good.  Did some washing.  Getting very monotonous in this Camp.  Shall be glad to get back to the old crowd.  "Oriss" is working on a Fatigue Party wheeling Barrow loads of dirt about, but I am doing nothing.  Staff. Brender &amp; Jack Woodward went away last night with an Artillery draft.  After Tea wrote Mrs Pudney &amp; Ruth B.</p>
<p>Thur. Aug. 23  Rained heavily last night &amp; the ground is quite sloppy again.  "Oriss" had a nasty fit of coughing during the night &amp; spit up a lot of Blood.  He paraded to the M.O. (so called) but, of course, got no satisfaction.  <br/>Later  Oriss got much worse, &amp; was spiting up clots of Blood.  This was no good, so I went to the Orderly Room &amp; asked to be paraded to the O.C.  Of course they wanted to know my reason, &amp; when I told 'em, they lived up a bit &amp;</p>
<p>LEFT BASE</p>
<p>"Oriss" was sent away in an ambulance to the Hospital at Havre. It was a Casino &amp; is a fine building, situated on the Esplanade.<br/>After Tea I took a few Cards at House.  It rained very heavily &amp; threatened to break up the school, but we stuck it, &amp; I came away winning 10 Francs.</p>
<p>Fri. Aug. 24.  Passed the M.O. this morning &amp; marked for duty.  We leave with a draft tonight to resume the strafe.  Spent the morning fixing up my gear.  Wrote a few lines to "Oriss".  Had Tea at 3.30.  Fell in at 4.15 &amp; marched away with a big crowd of Arty Inf. Tunnellers, Engrs, etc. to Havre Station, where we entrained.  <br/>I was i/c of 5 Div. A.M.C. which consisted of Phil Murray &amp; myself.  Lt. Slaughter was i/c of the whole party.  There were 3 of us in our carriage.  We were lucky in getting a carriage as most of the crowd travelled in Trucks.</p>
