4/8/17 Roquetoire Aire
seem most dirty, ragtime and far from desirable. Steering by the map we made across very pretty country towards Aire whose two towers (Church and Hotel de Ville) look out all over the country. We rode through the winding old streets with their dingy and aged houses and came out in the square and put our horses up at the Hotel du Clef d?Or. On the corner of this square is an old Guard room about 1600. The Town Hall is also a fine old building. Round the streets are jolly good shops ? stationers clothing etc. We went round to the Church 15th Century. Its tower is square and like those at St Omer. Entering we found a fine interior with some very good stained glass and pretty side chapels. Old world air about everything ? a few praying visitors. Left here and went round the street again to make a few purchases, kiddies coming up and asking us if we wanted "a mademoiselle". At 7.30 went to the Hotel d?Angleterre for a real French dinner commencing
