About &frac12; a mile from the wharf we were halted for a few minutes, &amp; I took the opportunity to run down to the waters edge &amp; gathered a few shells. Cray fish are evidently very plentiful, for their shells are numerous, &amp; one of the pioneers picked up a live one at the waters edge between some stones. From here</p>
