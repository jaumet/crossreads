 January 1917 21st   I have been ordered back to bed again &amp; last night had a temperature of 101.4. 22nd   We received news to-day of a disastrous explosion in a munition factory in the east of London on Friday night (20th) in which over 40 lives were lost &amp; over 100 persons injured.  Great damage was caused in the surroundings of the factory which was completely demolished together with a flower mill adjoining it.  The weather here is still bitterly cold &amp; although the snow has been thawing for the last three days it is still about three inches thick.
