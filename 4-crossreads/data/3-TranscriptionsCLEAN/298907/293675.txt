because I go at it for a learner with such pace & rashness, but I am getting on splendid & soon will be a right as rain.
I had to get the Dr to have a look at my arms this morning great big lumps came out on them in a few hours & they were very sore, the Dr ordered them to be well rubbed with some ointment, they seem a good deal easier tonight.
There is great fun in our Ward every evening for as sure as you go out some of the nurses are bound to short sheet your bed, & there is the devil to play.
It has been a glorious day quite hot & I thoroughly enjoyed my evening stroll round the city, I think half the girls in Birmingham know us now for we get the glad eye all along the streets.
