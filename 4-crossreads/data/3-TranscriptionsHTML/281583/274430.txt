<p>my feet being like blocks of ice made me feel fairly miserable all day.</p>
<p>They have approached me to take up Depot Sgt Major whilst at Montauban, over three Brigade Coys, &amp; on the understanding that it is temporary  I have agreed to act in that capacity. A batch of 3000 prisoners has been passed back through our cages, having been taken by the Guard Division.</p>
<p>Troops still continue to pour in &amp; everything points to a big battle being fought for Bapaume. At the present time Fritz is again shelling. Whilst our guns are heavily engaged in shelling him. Everything points to a heavy fight tonight.</p>
<p>16.11.16  Thursday</p>
<p>Last night proved to be in keeping with all the other &amp; we all very nearly gassed ourselves. The weather being so utterly cold we made a fire of coal &amp; coke in our hut &amp; did not notice that all ventilation was blocked. As a result we all inhaled the poisenous fumes &amp; have been vomiting off &amp; on ever since.</p>
<p>It is extremely hard to keep away from the spirits this weather but after a certain little indulgence I had I am not going to have any more.</p>
<p>We have had the worst day experienced &amp; goodness knows what the night will bring. This morning broke without a cloud in the sky</p>
