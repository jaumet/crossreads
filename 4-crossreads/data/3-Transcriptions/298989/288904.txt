<p>Our aeroplanes very active during the morning no less than 5 being aloft at once. A Taube flew over later on and our antiaircraft guns did some close shooting. Observed from the Tambour post that the enemy were seen in larger numbers than usual going towards their latrines. Mackay reported so in almost these words and our repetition to Brigade evoked a rather amusing reply.  Maconachi ration for tea am saving mine for when we move out meantime in the mess we have a large</p>
