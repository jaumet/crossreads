<p>7 July 1918 Sunday<br/>Church Service 7.30 pm<br/>Blood Test taken for "Malarial" in the morning- mostly Indians &amp; Australians in the Valley as it is not considered fit for <u>white</u> Troops<br/>Horses still well but Dopey GAS drill again &amp; all the usual duties of a mounted Unit, means more work for men than INFANTRY.  Been issued with those wretched STEEL HELMETS again, too <u>hot</u> to handle.  The rushing sound of the Farrier's "Forge" puts the wind up some of us now.  Good health means good nerves- And I'll admit I'm scared on some of these night WIRING parties, when Jacko shells heavily.</p>
