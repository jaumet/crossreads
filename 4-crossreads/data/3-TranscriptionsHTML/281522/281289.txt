<p>18/5/17 Bouzincourt<br/>Colonel Davis left early for his leave to Paris, Marseilles, Nice etc. took over and commenced by getting the whole morning devoted to cleaning out the billets and their neighbourhood. At 11.30 set out again for Warloy and had a pleasant ride out over the same ground as yesterday. The Chateau has very fine woods behind it, the trees being planted in neat rows through which a glimpse of statuary and water can be gained. The Germans burnt the left wing. The old Marchioness is extremely ill and some of our doctors from Warloy attended her last night. The entrance to Warloy is down a hill by a very twisting road that well warrants the caution "Ralentir". It is a fine little village with numerous comfortable houses. There is a Parisienne with red stockings who entertains platoons and there are also many nice respectable people. Had dinner with General Gellibrand and then adjourned to the 24th HQ and with Colonel Watson tried a man by Court Martial &amp; awarded him 2 years hard.</p>
