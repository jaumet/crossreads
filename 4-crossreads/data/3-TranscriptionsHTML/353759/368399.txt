<p>before which lasted from midnight 11 till last night at 8.30.  He in the afternoon at the brothels and self at Wimille &ndash; and the room as pretty as possible &ndash; a cake of Val"s starting it.</p>
<p>The transfer to the 43rd came through yesterday to join up when they arrive in France.  Before he goes he"s writing to Major Chaytor &ndash; 8 Field &ndash; to get me a transfer.  Tonight he got from the same man a letter advising him to stay where he is &ndash; and a while back a cable from his Mater.</p>
<p>324  Nov. 17<br/>Last night C Line "out of action" and patients distributed, so slept:  and all night from 10 till 7 this morning &ndash; with Jake"s blankets &ndash; and no duty till 8 this morning.  This morning it snowed &ndash; a fitting comment of nature &ndash; and a saving one:  at 4 we were to have met M.K. and J.M. &ndash; out behind Wimille &ndash; J. had 2 F. and I, 3.50 &ndash; that is out of the 20 we borrowed from King a day ago, we"ve now 5.50 &ndash; and J."s made an appointment for the pictures on Sunday.</p>
<p>It"s too cold to do anything, let alone write for a while.  I"ll read Swinburne and place nearby his influence on Nina Murdoch"s "Songs of the Open Air" &ndash; to assist in the task, a tin of Turf cigarettes and all my blankets.</p>
<p>325<br/>"Ah woe is me! that I should fondly part<br/>From my dear native land &ndash; Keats.</p>
<p>Nina writes,<br/>The wattle has unbound her golden hair,<br/>Making such golden mist upon the air,<br/>The little breezes breathless with delight<br/>Pass her a tip-toe lest she take to flight.<br/>And suddenly the sleeping scent is stirred<br/>By the low liquid whistle of a mating bird.</p>

<p>The wind and his trumpet that herald November,<br/>Endless and infinite crossing the downs,<br/>Then comes the wind<br/>That teareth himself and doth fiercely dismember,<br/>With heavy breaths turbulent smiting the towns,<br/>The savage wind comes, the fierce wind of November &ndash; Verhaeren.</p>
<p>326  Nov. 20<br/>Tonight our last set of dominoes:  tomorrow Jake leaves for No. 25 at Flanders with Scotch and Pluintis:  and the chances make it that Blighty may early follow.</p>
<p>Tonight"s mail with its &pound;10 and word of another &pound;10 is now as more edition de luxe than [indecipherable] man.</p>
<p>Maleish:  I"ll be a philosopher, read Epictetus and be thankful for his, not Epictetus"s, but Jake"s bed.</p>
<p>327<br/>Just on ten months ago since he arrived at Ghezireh, over ten or twelve weeks since we became pals.  At Ghezireh the first months he wore on his shoulder, 1 L.H.F.A. &ndash; at the time Dearling and myself were getting our transfers through to the main unit.</p>
<p>The modelling of his forearms, his hands and Pagan slenderness and grace, made me anxious to know him &ndash; but right up till Monssot he remained almost apart from the unit, yet friendly with all, to a certain extent.  On the Mediterranean he was with the rotten crowd, and of it as much as they:  at Monssot he was still stuck to by the last of the crowd, and he stuck to them till the end of June.  But even then, his worst period , he was with the shelter crowd &ndash; and a leader of the swimming, and the organiser of the carnival when he carried off the championships.  When we arrived here, he was a wreck, stood it out for a while, carried himself, developed and was admitted to hospital and on discharge came on to duty with me &ndash; and we"ve stuck together since, to my benefit greatly and to his.  Dear Jake, I owe you a clearer mind, a broader outlook and a deeper sympathy.</p>
<p>Christ God, who savest man,<br/>Save most of men, Count Gismond<br/>Who saved me.</p>
