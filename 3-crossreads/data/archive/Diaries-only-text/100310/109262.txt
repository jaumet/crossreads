10/8/17 St. Omer, Calais, Boulogne, Etaples, Abbey [indecipherable]
Got into a train crowded full and set off at 1p.m. on a long and tiresome journey having as travelling companions a few padres and some English officers. Journey to Calais was not bad ? one sees little of the town beyond one peculiarly shaped spire. The line runs down from here along the sea and is low lying and duny. After leaving Boulogne this continues altogether and around Etaples there are enormous camps and hospitals. Near here I think I saw the largest military cemetery on record ? a forest of neat little crosses packed closely together and extending for hundreds of yards. Our journey began to get very tiresome with frequent long stops. At Etaples saw M Pezet changed carriages took over as O.C. Troops which caused me to rub up at least one RTO the wrong way. Everyone delights in being nasty to these unfortunates. Travelled all night.
