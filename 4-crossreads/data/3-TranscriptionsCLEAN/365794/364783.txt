 25 Very busy still though Pt. Woodhouse died 7.30 p.m.  Letters (7) came yesterday from Sydney.  All well. 
 25.9.'18 Busy day.  Pt. Parker G.S.W. of mouth, put on D.I. list, mouth very offensive.  Matron kind & has so far been good & considerate.  Pts. 45 in ward. Off duty 2-5, wrote Eva & Ida. 3 R.A.F. boys burnt to death today brings list to 8 this wk. I believe?  Rec'd 18 letters & 1 of snaps last mail, very enjoyable. Re R.A.Force, a Greek collided with a 'plane (2 English)  all  both fired & crashed.  Greek burnt to pieces on back, all nearly unrecognizable.
