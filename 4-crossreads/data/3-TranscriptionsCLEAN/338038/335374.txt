  
 I will not hear now till I rejoin. 
 Have not struck any mates over here yet but Tommy Clark is in Hosp at Brighton so I will look him up there - He had a spill from his horse a few weeks ago & is nursing a broken ankle in consequence. 
 Will write you again from Brighton - Hope you are both well & that
