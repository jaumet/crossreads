Dug out & as we were at lunch Fritz began shelling us.  He sent over quite a few.  It gives one a queer sensation at first when shells fall near one, but the feeling is "stay still & hope they will go anywhere else".  I went along nearly all our Front line yesterday.  It is in a terrible condition in some places.  It is just churned up with shell fire, wet & cold.Got back about dark very tired.
Thursday 7thVisited Hospital this morning, also looked out place for service.  Raining slightly, cold.
Friday 8thVisited the Trenches today, had lunch with Capt. Connell.  A heavy bombardment began at 1.30 & continued till about dark.  Great shells went screaming overhead & burst with a dull thud in the enemy's trenches.Mills looked in after Tea.
