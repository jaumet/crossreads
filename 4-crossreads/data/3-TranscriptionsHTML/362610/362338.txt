<p>Tuesday 2 May 1916<br/>A dull grey day with intermittent showers. Did not get dressed but stayed in pyjamas censoring letters, reading &amp;c. A foggy night, but I heard next morning that the instruments on Etaples hill had recorded the presence of a Zeppelin during the night. Alone &amp; with a sore foot made my first attempt to smoke a cigarette before turning over to sleep.<br/>Outward mail for Australia.</p>
