 24/  Been on 4 Hectic Days leave & never felt cold all the time. Saw C. in Wareham & stayed - 24 th  - night in camp there. He's doing C.B. very prettily & everything seems OK. Looks a bit worn & has bad foot but can take nourishment. Sorry I couldn't stay there longer. Went on to Hortons & was welcomed. Like them Beaucoup.                                      London needs remoddeling & cleaning. Smells bad.           12 Feb. Feel very off. M. O told me nothing wrong -- go on parade. Went to D r  Williams in village. Slight pleurisy. Camping alongside O. Room fire by Coleman's orders.
