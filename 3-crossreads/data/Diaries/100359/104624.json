The drivers wore big fur coats, and they needed ?em too, as it was very cold. We passed through a number of pretty little villages until we got to Amiens. This is a fine big city, but we only passed through the outskirts. They have electric cars there, and as soon as our crowd caught sight of ?em they cheered like mad.

A party of ten of us stayed at one place the smallest and best of the lot and we had plenty of straw to sleep on. The people are very cranky and don't seem to have any time for soldiers. There were a few small shops    around, but it was impossible to purchase anything, as they were all sold out before we arrived. Stan Wright asked the woman at the farm to make him a mess tin full of coffee. She did so, but most begrudgingly, without milk or sugar, and wanted to charge him a franc but Stan politely told her to keep it. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n","format":"plain_text","safe_value":"<p><a name=\"a5299138\"></a></p>\n<p>[Page 138]<br><br />\nAbout 9 Mac D.Alldiss and a party of machine gunners arrived and helped to swell the singing.
