<p>individually to prevent a deviation, were quite patent, even to those without the knowledge of one Dutch word.</p>
<p>When it came to a decision the question was put by the "Speaker" first in Dutch, then in English</p>
<p>The Government was supported in such a manner that an incipient rebellion was crushed then &amp; there, &amp; to confirm the decision it merely meant two or three Government representatives proceeding to the disaffected parts &amp; clearly stating, the only position that could arise, if any other power but Britain was behind them.</p>
<p>One passage by one of the speakers in English was very telling:&ndash; He, referring to H[dash]g, asks for freedom? What Freedom? If he meant freedom from the protecting influence of the British flag, how could they, standing alone, be successful in repulsing an attack by any nation, or by even the very smallest nation rightly or wrongly deemed to have been insulted? Why if a Japanese were, accidentally, to be pushed off the Pier at Capetown, &amp; the incident purposely used as a "Case for War", how long would they, standing absolutely alone, enjoy <u>his</u> boasted wished for freedom? Freedom! What is he now enjoying? Is he not indulging in greater freedom, than when a subject, under the flag of the late Boer Republic?</p>
<p>Would he have the same freedom of speech then, as he has now, &amp; actually be allowed to come into the House of Parliament to advocate what is practically Insurrection?</p>
<p>In no other Country, would any person be allowed so openly to give such an expression of opinion, but Britain, the freedom of the British Empire which relies on the common sense of the majority to counteract such injurious &amp; poisonous propaganda.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, such pernicious views would be deemed treasonable</p>
