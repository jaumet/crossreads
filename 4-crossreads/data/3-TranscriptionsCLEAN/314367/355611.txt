 Coaling is just starting & we shall be dirty before its over - Niggers coal us - Mr Bumpus views this with disgust  - 'Kiki - Smoke-O - Rest O' - says Mr B & winked solemnly - "Better use our own men" We had a thunderstorm last eveg. Temp at 6 am was 89o F - Generally its like a wet February in Q-land with a breeze from the NW - N.W. monsoonal weather - 
 Sunday. Dec 20-14. Since I last wrote a few things have happened - of gossiping interest mainly - About noon on Friday we went up alongside the Eastern who lay at the Rabaul pier - where the old Berrima lay in Sept - We were to take coal from her - This interesting but dirty operation continued all Friday aftn. & eveg. till 2 am Saty. & finally ended about 1 pm on the Saty. Slow work but we couldn't help that - Any rig is allowed - Bathing costume is a favorite one - Shouting - Singing - Language - It's an ordered pandemonium of half naked men -
