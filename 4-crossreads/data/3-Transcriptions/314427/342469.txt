<p>where I had dinner and at 2.45 caught the train for Kesh at the Great Northern Station.<br/>In Workman Clark s Co yards there were 3 big ships on the slips being built and in the other 1 big ship,  but there may have been many more for I was not in their yards.</p>
<p>Friday February 21. 1919 (103)<br/>Third day of leave.<br/>I reached Kesh at 7.30 last night, and walked down the line about a quarter of a mile to my  Uncle's John Gilmors. I had to change trains at Clones and Bundorn junction.<br/>This evening I walked out to Mr. Andrew Muldoons at Drumard and stayed until after 8. o'clock and walked back to Kesh. It was a very dark night. The flax mill was working in Kesh, scutching flax which consists in removing the fibre from the stalk,The machinery was driven by a water wheel. Last year when I was here, the mill was sawing timber but now it has gone back to its old trade.</p>
<p>Saturday February 22. 1919   (104)<br/>4th day of leave.<br/>It is very dull and cloudy this morning, &amp; look like rain.</p>
