 August 1917 Thursday 9th Finished up bombing early this morning &amp; then started shelling again got very close to the Hospital at times so we are going to shift the hospital in the meantime we are drafted to various C.C.S's.   Myself &amp; a lot of others went to Baillieul it is pretty close to the line &amp; we are surrounded by aerodromes so we are in a dangerous place.  The hospital is part of an internal [indecipherable] Lunatic Asylum.  There are 1400 Women in it of all nationalities so there is not much fear of him shelling us. Friday 10th Fritz commenced the day by by sending over a lot of stuff into the railway station &amp; bombed all round us this evening.   We have great entertainment watching these aeroplanes as there are thousands here
