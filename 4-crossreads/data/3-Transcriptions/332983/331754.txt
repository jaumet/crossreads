<p>this morning, Weather still warm and fine. Flies still plentiful New M.O. visited our wagon line yesterday, Nothing suited him, one of those men that quoted book all the time. I might say that our doctor Capt Howes and Corp Jones and another man went to hospital with fever All A.M.C. men. Fever is raging here. The fleet reserve men belonging to the R.N.D. have gone to Lemnos to be drafted onto boats. The French have landed some 55 Millimetre guns a little over 6in they fire on the top of Achi Baba. Today Tuesday is a feast day of the Turks An attack is likely to take place but so far there are no signs of it They still continue to shell the beach. They shell from two places. Achi Baba and the Asiatic shore, and without doubt 150 to 200 shells lop there every day. As I write this the shells are going over. The damage they do is comparatively small. The most serious damage of all was a shell through ordnance store. Great talk about the French 75 Field Artillery and the damage they do. The guns are good no doubt, but still, they kill a terrible lot of their men, and ours</p>
