Support ? Treux Mericourt
The General called about 10 a.m. and soon after him came a Gas Projector officer from the Special Coy R.E. to arrange details of a gas stunt. Another bright and sunny day. Had been awakened as usual for the stand to arms but nothing developed. After lunch took Thewlis out around the coys. Our 18-pounders shot down a Hun ?plane early this morning. Went along to King and was talking there when the Hun started throwing round 5.9's which burst loudly with plenty of white smoke. Some of these came round close enough to be uncomfortable. From here we made for the bank near Marett Wood and talked to Groves and Swanton. The Boche was putting over 5.9 in doubles ? the two coming together made a noise like an 11 inch shell
