 Dear Mr Minister 
 Re Lieutenant K. A. Ferguson 
 Following up my letter of the 27th instant, I enclose you a letter I have received from young Ferguson, together with a copy of my reply, which speak for themselves.  You will see what a jolly good chap he is. 
 Kindly thoughts 
 Truly yours 
 Robt. McC. Anderson
