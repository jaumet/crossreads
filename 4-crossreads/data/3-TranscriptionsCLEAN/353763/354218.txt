 Nothing doing  -  We went up alongside the Aorangi for water  -  Got none or very little I believe  -  This morning at 7 am we went out into the bay & anchored Elms & Blayney - two of our absent officers - rejoined us last eveg  - Elms had been in the Sumatra - a prize fitted with a gun in her bows & used for patrol work  - Blayney had been skipper of another prize the Madang & used to carry the military & stores to Herbershohe  -  Elms has a keen sense of humor & is a most enjoyable chap  -  He said he was glad to be back for he had been afraid they might be arrested for 'loitering'  -  He had also recommended that a gun should be put in the stern of the Sumatra - she must run he remarked & we could poop the enemy & the recoil wd  -  shoot us ahead an extra 5 knots for a bit  -  He can drink & talk some  -  I can vouch for it  -  Captains Moore & Stoker put off to a 'pow wow' on the flagship at 9.30  -  What transpired we haven't been told so here we are marking time  -  All leave stopped  -  Its Oct 1st  -  My ship's Company & that of AE2 & the Protector are all well  -  I returned my only anxious case (Murray) at 2.30 yesterday by the mail boat to Sydney  -  He wants a little retail attention by means of Radium or a surgical operation of a delicate nature & I am sure no one here could do that so thoroughly as  in  a big Sydney hospital  -
