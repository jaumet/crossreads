The Y.M.C.A. TENT is on the Beach & is a good boon to the men - PIANO, writing material a CINEMA at night & free issue of cocoa at night. Besides selling Biscuits, cakes, etc:  I notice H.L.A. is doing a lot in HAY to help the Y.M.C.A., it is a worthy institution.
Went Church but the sound of the waves drowned the Preacher's voice.
[The following paragraph crossed through.]Our Artillery is daily remains the Turk effectives but at least 7% & very large preparations are being made here for our advance out this time. Cavalry will be used for proposed job we hope. No more frontier attack recommended at entrenched TURKS.
