To-day we had a mist & a bit of fog & this is the "foggy month of November." Well, Dad, Mum & George, this is a horrible letter after not writing for 10 days but I have given You all the news.  Oh! on Sunday last Ellis & I went out to see the Maori's play Football just near bye.  It is the first Time we've been out to-gether for months. Now, it is near supper Time & I've got to be in the rush or I'll get none.  We have a cup of Soup or Coffee every night at 8.45 pm. Give Regards to the neighbours & to Mrs Stephen, Bunting & Dobson also Mr & Mrs Ali. Fondest Love from Harry
