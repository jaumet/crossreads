3These houses were all in the Christian quarter - the only part of the city worth considering. There are some really fine places in that locality but elsewhere it is the old mud hut style of dwelling with flat roof.
The citadel in the middle of the city is worth going to - it is a huge artificial mound surmounted by a fort & surrounded by a moat - now dry. These mounds have been built at intervals of a few miles all through this Country - in the towns as defensive forts & in the country as signal stations I take it.
The bazaars are quite the best I have seen - miles of them. There seems to be no shortage - you can buy anything from a needle to an anchor - but foodstuffs are very dear - not because they are so short I think but because the owners think they can sell to the army at a high rate & so wont sell to Civilians. Being Armenians they do that very well. I am quite sure no Jew could make a living amongst Armenians - I think the Turk made a great mistake when he didn't massacre the lot of them. Theyre just a lot of money makers whose only means idea of protecting themselves is to lie down & whine
