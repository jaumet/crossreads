She has beaten every horse that she has had a trial with including the Colonel's.  She has delightful feminine ways & is dreadfully greedy.  There are about 4 subalterns & about a dozen N.C.Os all trying to see me at once so I think I had better close.  I am afraid my letters have been scrappy lately.

Affectionately yoursC.R. Lucas
