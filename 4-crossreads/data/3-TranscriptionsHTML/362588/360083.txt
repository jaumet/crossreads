<p>Albury Hospital Building Fund<br/>Mayor's Appeal<br/>Albury</p>
<p>June 23/15</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Fitzgerald,</p>
<p>I shall be pleased to act on the committee to keep in touch with your Battalion, and would suggest that you also ask Mr. A. Waugh (Mayor of Albury) and Mr. R.T. Beatty (Gundagai) to act too.  I am making an Australia Day appeal through the "Banner" and will suggest, when the money is being sent in, that part of it be applied as you suggest.</p>
<p>Sincerely yrs.<br/>J.A. Gray</p>
