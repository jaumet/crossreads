 My dearest Father, Very little news of interest this week.  There has been no Australian Mail in since I last wrote   I saw Wal for a few minutes last week & he was in good health.  He was expecting to get his leave almost at any time. I have not heard anything more about my leave so expect I will be very lucky if I get it this side of Christmas. My chief went on leave again yesterday so that I will have an easy time of it till he returns All our clocks here were retarded an hour at midnight last night, so that we are now working to the same time as we were last June before they were advanced. We have been having lovely Autumn weather here this past week but it is very much like rain again to-night. Must close now with love to you all at home Your loving son, Leo
