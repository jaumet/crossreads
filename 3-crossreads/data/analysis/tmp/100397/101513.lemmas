 Someday perhap , our Head Quarter Staff will learn to handl the men and avoid friction . at present they seem to do all that is possibl to rous the men up . they do not seem to realis yet that the men are not go to stand be impos on or bulli . their Idea of Disciplin will never work . nor their Idea of Justic . We can read of " British Justic " anytim but armi Justic here . is " Rotten " in mani way . and amongst the civilian , Justic seem to be made to suit one set onli " the Rich" . it was plan purpos to crippl the poor man . or in other word British Justic as practis here in Britain is a farc . We have far more of it in Australia , and mani of our law are year ahead of this Island law . But I did not sit down here to tell you about The way thing are done here . I had a veri nice letter from Mrs. Horton last night when I came here from Wareham I was in hope that I would get leav befor I left for Franc so that I could go and see them again , but it is out of the question . I met one of my old mate here , also my Platoon Sgt . Simmon was still go strong in Decemb and may still be allright I hope so anyway . he was veri lucki .
