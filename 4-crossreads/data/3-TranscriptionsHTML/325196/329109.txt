The Brigadier (Cox) objects to the Bde being split up &amp; is trying to stop the 1st Regt. from going away next Monday unless the Bde goes; sorry to hear today from a letter from Will that Uncle Orvill had died</p>
<p>11-2-16<br/>Fri 11th<br/>More Helio work this morning &amp; nothing doing this afternoon; After tea Les took the lamp out a little way from the lines &amp; sent back to give Reid some practise; The Regimental parades are for the most part practising Cossack Post duty with an occasional sham fight.</p>
