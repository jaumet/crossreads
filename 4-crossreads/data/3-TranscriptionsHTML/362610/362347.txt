<p>Thursday 11 May 1916<br/>Again a fine clear day. Got instructions that 60 of my men were to be told off to proceed to the front, &amp; was kept very busy going thro' the roll detailing the men &amp; then getting them fully equipped. Missed mess at night thro' having to inspect them to be sure that all was correct.</p>
