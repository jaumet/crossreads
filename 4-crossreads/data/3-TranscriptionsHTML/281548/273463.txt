<p>To the memory of our sister ship AE1, and her crew, Lost September 14th, 1914 in St. Georges Channel, between German New Guinea and New Island.<br/>We took the first patrol on the 13th, they took the second next day.  We came back, they did'nt.  The path of duty became the high-way of mystery for they never came back.  They lie coffined in the deep, keeping their silent watch at <strike>the</strike> Australia's North Passage, hereos all.</p>
