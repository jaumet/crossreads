 Atmosphere close &amp; muggy sky threatening. X Swimming bath not available on the well deck &ndash; 9th  Threatening. Sea getting rough. Making for the African Coast at 13&frac12; Knots to avoid an expected hurricane.  7 pm  Just finished 1 hours pack drill. La Touche 2nd in charge gave me 3 days pack drill because I hadn't shaved for 24 hours. Paraded to the OC who reduced sentence to 2 hours &amp; promised to look into the matter. Rotten when a man has to needlessly shave every day. 10th On fatigue duty today but have done nothing except read &amp; wash a few clothes
