<p>Our Band gave a selection on the village square this afternoon which was much appreciated by both civilians and 'diggers'.<br/>About 8.30 p.m. Bn. Routine Orders came along in which a Church Parade was ordered for all Protestant Denomination<strike>s</strike> at 10.30 tomorrow. We were having a quiet game of cards <strike>whe</strike> at the time and as the order stated that at least one officer from each Company had to accompany the parade somebody suggested dealing a Poker Hand <strike>to</strike> the loser to take 'C' Corp' parade to church. I lost, having only one pair of queens against two pairs, full hands <strike>and</strike>flushes and heaven only knows what.</p>
