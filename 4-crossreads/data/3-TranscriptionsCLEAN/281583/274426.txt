  
 was a salvoe of shells from the Germans & from what I can see of the place & the direction the shells came from, we are going to be very lucky men if we get out of this place safely. 
 After getting some water on to boil we looked about for shelter. I eventually found a tent which is not much protection from shells but it was a cover for my head & that suited. Just about this time Fritz put some more over & they were dangerously close. One threw mud all over the tent. The others fell in the vicinity . 
 We are unfortunately in a very dangerous position being camped just in front of the Rail Head. This as is only natural is a vital stragetic point , & the Germans knowing same are trying very hard to get it. This makes it most unpleasant & I will be sincerely pleased when we get right out of it. 
 My cold is still troublesome & very irritable at night. I went to bed but not to sleep. The shelling still continued to come over & passing over our heads with the old familiar but sinister hiss made sleep impossible. 
 At about 4am the guns opened up a heavy bombardment, & seeing that there are some naval guns alongside us, sleep was an impossibility. The firing ceased at dawn and I slept until 9am.
