<p>Working 12 hours a day does not make you write many letters.  I hope Mick Slade will let me know when he arrives.<br/>We have heaps of men from Salisbury Plain where all the Australians are in training.<br/>We were so sorry to hear you were seedy again &ndash; you must have been glad Dr. MacCormick was back if it only stops those horrible back aches this time you must be fed up with it all.<br/>We have had practically no summer so far &ndash; all dull and lots of rain &ndash; deadly on your clothes.<br/>I hope your Fur Coat and all the other oddities arrived.  I turned out my memo of what I did the other day which made me wonder if everything</p>
