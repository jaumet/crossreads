<p>No. 21 Camp, Larkhill,<br/>18th. October 1916.</p>
<p>My dear Parents.<br/>Just a short line to let you know I am well and still in England. I received your cable three days ago and had a few day previously Cabled for ten pounds to be sent to the<br/>Commonwealth Bank in London.<br/>I was very glad to hear that you received the snaps and thought them good. Unfortunately I will not be able to take my camera to France with me so I will probably have to post it to you shortly. I succeeded a few days ago in securing some rather good pictures of an aeroplane and will enclose them with my next letter.<br/>Half of our Battalion have already had their final King's leave and I am to go with the remainder in a few days. We got four days in all and before we leave each man is required to show at least four pounds. Unfortunately I hadn't succeeded in saving any of my pay so I sent the cable.<br/>I received a pair of gloves yesterday addressed in Kits inimitable style and they were more than welcome. The cold here now is intense and my hands were beginning to chap. I received a letter from mother yesterday. Excuse brevity - have just heard that mail closes at 1 O'clock but as there will be another on the 21st Inst. I will write again shortly.<br/>With love, Eugene.</p>
