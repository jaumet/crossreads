<p>my first visit to Amiens yesterday (had been through in the train twice before). Got a ride in an ambulance to the nearest railway station Mericourt-Ribemont (6 kiloms) and arrived at the fine Gare du Nord at Amiens about 10 am. Had a good look round and left again by train at 8 pm. Amiens is a fine large town with broad streets and a good tramway service. It reminds one very much of Paris only on a smaller scale of course. The people speak good French and dress well &ndash; Parisian style.</p>
<p>I visited the splendid Cathedral &ndash; one of the finest in France and well worth seeing. Amiens does not boast of many interesting features from a spectacular point of view. I had a glimpse at the old city ([indecipherable] Amiens), Hotel Dieu, Hotel des Postes, Hotel de Ville, Eglise Saint Leu. The Picardy Museum was closed so I did not see it. There are numerous French Military Hospitals about probably the finest of which is the one established in the Palais de Justice. Amiens was in possession of the German forces 31st Aug to 11th Sept 1914.</p>
