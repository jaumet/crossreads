June 9only a French soldier and a Tommy picquet there.  On to Cassel, and two kilos along the road a lift to the town in a Tommy lorry.
At Cassel dinner with two 8th Batt. lads and an Artilleryman.
A morning full of a burning sun, but a hazing afternoon, and in the early evening rain, so back early, tired and disappointed with the whole day's outing.
I often wonder how the seeing of their own womenfold under shell bombardment must affect the French soldier, towards the Hondeghem church passed me an old couple the old wrinkled peasant woman carefully slinging her gas mask, the piquet in Steenvoorde told me the Boche had shelled lately with gas.
So with the wrecking and creating desolate the bonser old town of Steenvoorde he adds another rose to his [indecipherable] skull's garland.
June 10194.Today clouds in the sky, and heavy raining all the early afternoon:  then at 5 a clearing of the clouds, and a sun over a brilliantly clear countryside, out with Ken, to a farmhouse for Eggs and Chips, so on walking and a yarning on the influence of art, of morality and immorality as conceived by the people of no sight.  Ken holds the usual view of the nude and the naked - differentiates between them as the nude being expressed only by art, the naked by artfulness, but I think they are the same thing, only the difference is the beauty of the naked body, if it is ugly, it is obscene either nude or naked.
From Davis & Oriole D'Annunzio's "The Virgins of the rocks" and note of J. Davidson's "Ballads & Songs", 7/6, so tonight a writing for it.
Still no mail from the Unit.  Today it is two weeks since the arriving of the last T.L.S.
George has Butler's "Way of All Flesh" and Waugh's "Loom of Youth":  must borrow later.
