XXXXXDarling Eddy,
I hope you will like the hat I'm sending you by Sister Craig -   &  that it will fit  you alright. I'm going to Alexandria to-day for a week or so, for a holiday. Hope you are all well. Tell Auntie Belle I have just received Parcel also from Mrs Balfour. Fondest love   &  kisses. From Auntie Eadle.
