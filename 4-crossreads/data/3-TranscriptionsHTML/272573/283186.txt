<p>D. W. &amp; myself visited a farmhouse and had some coffee. A fine big farmhouse it was, and, the eldest girl of a family of five, could speak and write English very well. She said she had studied the language at school, which means convent, for four years, and by coming in contact with the troops who were at times billeted in their fields she had managed to pick up the language so as to speak it fluently.</p>
