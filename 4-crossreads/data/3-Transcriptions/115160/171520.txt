<p>I see Rose &amp; Liza Montgomery have been down for another visit. &nbsp;They will not be as young this time as the last.</p>
<p>Two months have gone since your last letter, Dad, and now it is down to 8 months before you can give as much lip as possible. &nbsp;I suppose you have made some plans for the future, for I cannot imagine you sitting down doing nothing. &nbsp;For instance. Mr. Christie&#39;s success might have made you a bit curious, and you might be thinking of going in for some fowls too. &nbsp;I&#39;m told that it looks as if land down Jervis Bay - way is likely to prove a good spec in the future. &nbsp;You might keep your eye on this spot. &nbsp;It would not be hard to blossom out into a land speculator. &nbsp;Anyhow, Dad, think it over and drop me a line as to your intentions. &nbsp;It&#39;s no good waiting until you are retired before you start thinking. &nbsp;Start now. &nbsp;And I hope the old pepper and salt helps you along in the idea of being prosperous yet.</p>
