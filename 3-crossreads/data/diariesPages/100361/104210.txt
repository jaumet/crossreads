Squally day. Finished up about 2 p.m. Walked into Warminster. Rained all the time.
Strolled round the Town. Things very quiet. Went into a sort of Y.M. Hut and had Sandwiches, Cake and Tea. Some chap was playing the Piano, and pretty good too, a few others were singing and I passed away a couple of hours there.
