  
 June way as we are going, as they do not make the ship roll as much as they would do if they were broadside on.  As it is there is a great deal of movement in the ship. 
 June the 14th To-day we are well into the Bight.  The sea is in an awful turmoil.  Breakers are comming right across the upper deck which is at least 20 feet above the calm water line.  The wind is very strong and is lashing the waves into spray which blows right over the whole ship.  The surface of the water is covered with white froth and foam. 
 Toward nightfall the wind died down but the ship is still rolling and pitching much more than it was yesterday.  On deck is very uncomfortable and it is almost impossible to walk about the decks.  They are slanting too
