present) man. I have met dozens of boys here who know you wish you the best of luck. There are several in our unit who come from Auburn. I met a chap named Percy Hall who knows you very well. Also Shirt Mat Batey. The last two are in our unit. There are dozens of others but too numerous to mention. They all say they wont be duped this time so I think it will be a bit different to last election. We are having very decent weather again now, still cold 
frosty every morning though. We, in the army still get plenty to eat but things are none too good in England. Well Vol there is not much I can do for you individually but there is plenty I can will do for your party especially with those arguments statements in the paper. Am afraid Sis will think this a dry letter but never mind. Must close now so wishing you Sis Noni the best of health Happiness (luck) I am your loving brother Hal
