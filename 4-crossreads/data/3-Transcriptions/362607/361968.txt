<p>11/9/17<br/>Dear George, Just a P.C. to remind you that we have not forgotten all about you. I was across this Bridge on the Bike tonight, The Amesbury Swimming Club have their meetings here. The water is too cold for me. But these English and Scotch Girls bathe all the year round. The men don't though. Gee the water is like Ice always. I am going to Salisbury To-morrow as usual. I went in on Wednesday last too. I have a good time always in there. Plenty of music too. I never get the chance to touch our piano. I was Canteen Corporal To-night by orders but a chap could not go on last night &amp; I took His place. It is pay night To-night &amp; it will very lively. Now George I'll write to Mum on Sunday. Au Revoir. Yours always  Harry</p>
