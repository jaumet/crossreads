  
 August 1915 Monday 16 Fine. All had a peaceful nights rest out here in support trenches. No  "Standing to"  in the morning about 4 AM when a chap feels that he wants to sleep most, and no sleeping in equipment so that we can make ourselves comfortable when turning in 
 Tuesday 17 Fine   Today is the  Anniversary of our Batt. the day when it began to be formed at Kensington Racecourse.  We came into the trenches again at 12 noon. We are fairly well dug in now.
