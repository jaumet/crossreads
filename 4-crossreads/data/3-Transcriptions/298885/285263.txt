<p>This war will right the wrong which Germany done to France in 1870 Germany is down and out and will no more rise to attempt a world wide domination</p>
<p>Although Germany has only signed an Armistice up to date, it is not peace. But dictated terms such as have been laid down by the Allies will prevent her from again opening up hostilities</p>
<p>Peace will be proclaimed on a day which we hope will dawn in the very near future</p>
<p>During the day 3 of us paid a visit to Abbeville</p>
