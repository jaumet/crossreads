<p>Sunday<br/>Last night at 11.30 we were aroused by the porter informing us that there was an air raid warning &amp; owing to the flimsy shelter of the hut we had to seek shelter in a cellar (by order) I got up &amp; partially dressed but as nothing further was heard I lay down again Rather hard on one when one expected a comfortable night's rest<br/>I went to Horseferry Rd to report but there was neither the senior Chaplain nor the official I wished to see at the office. From there I went to Westminster Abbey and heard part of the morning service. I left before it was over as I wanted to go to the Westminster Wesleyan Hall</p>
