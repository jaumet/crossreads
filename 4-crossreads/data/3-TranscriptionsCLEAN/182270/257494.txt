 TUESDAY, JULY 1, 1919. 
 Fine & cold wind. Burning off in 
 Middle till dinner time then 
 round the paddocks. I took 
 Tickle over today & pay him 
 35/- per week, & start to run the 
 place on its own. George finished 
 concreeting the troughs at Boundary 
 & has to wait a few days for them 
 to dry.
