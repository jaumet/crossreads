seem about to collide when they would all go in a different direction. It lasted for a good while finally they flew out of sight.After this there was unusual activity on the part of our planes it was very pretty to see the shrapnel bursting beneath them. As far as I could see none were brought down. Towards evening 10 pm I noticed a great number of Star shells being fired thought to myself that something was in the wind. Sure enough it was as we were all awakened at 12 o'clock from by the noise of a terrific bombardment, punctuated every now again by the deep boom of the Howitzers. This lasted until 6 am in the morning quietened down. I do not know the results of same yet. I was enlightened as to our accumulation of Guns stores behind the line it made me stagger. I do not wish to put it in writing here in case I lose this book but I can only say, that if this much talked of offensive proves successful from the start, I do not think there will be many Germans left to defend their Fatherland.
