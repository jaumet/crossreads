I nearly forgot to tell you that I also had a letter from Miss Lowe. She told me that she had been up at Ourimbah and had met F. Wilcox who looked extremely well. from the way the letter read I fancy he must be on his way over here, to see what its like. did you ever hear whether he had enlisted. Tell Mother that I dont fancy there is anyone else who would care for Photos of yours Humbly, unless Perhaps it might be that my old acquaintance. Mr A.W. Stagg. The agent who persuaded me to take out that Insurance Policy. he was a very nice chap, but I have not heard from him for some time. so do not know just were to write, but Care of T. G. Insurance Coy should find him as he is one of their agents, but dont send any unless there are plenty to go round. Now I must close with heaps of Love and Good wishes to all
Love to all at Goonigal when you see them from your Loving Bro. Chas. G. Pryce
I have not told you anything about Mine Host or Hostess or the Children will tell in next letter.
