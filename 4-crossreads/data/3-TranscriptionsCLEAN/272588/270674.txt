Wednesday 13 MarchVery quiet on the front, and what few casualties there are are from gas.We are living well, & doing nothing. Our meals are far better than we get at camp & I am No. 4 & chef.
Thursday 14 MarchWet to-day. In a raid last night by 10th & 12th Battns. on our left, fifty prisoners were brought in.  Fritz dropped a few showers of whiz-bangs about our dugout to-day some close.  They appear to have been a H.E. shell & a sneezing gas the object being to render one unable to wear the respirator. We opened a bombardment on Fritz to-night at 9.30 but so far no retaliation.
