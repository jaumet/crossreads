<p>reply but when a bomb landed right in amongst us and knocked out ten out of the thirty, the remaining twenty dashed over the top running straight at the intercepting Huns &amp; managed &ndash; goodness knows how &ndash; to get in here!! Although even then smiling at their muddied &amp; wet condition &ndash; they were still panting &amp; showed the effects of their hard run back, for life.<br/>Now those are the facts!

<p>Later on, on the Somme front, the 56th Battalion captured a Hun trench which actually showed these same identical features, so that this position was, then, made manifestly clear.</p>
