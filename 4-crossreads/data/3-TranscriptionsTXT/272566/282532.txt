 Friday 30 March 
 Awoke this morning &amp; was surprised to hear the birds chattering.  It is the first time for 18 months.  The country round about here is quite green, so different to the other side of Bapaume.  Went to Beaulencourt for rations &ndash; not ready in the morning so we had to return again in the afternoon.  Only one stretcher-case came through last night and two of our chaps took him on.  On coming to the big mine crater the whole lot, stretcher case included, slipped in. It is rumoured today that the 8th Fld. Amb. go out of action on the 5th ulto. Every village here is strewn with bottles which give the impression that Fritz is a bit of a drinker.
