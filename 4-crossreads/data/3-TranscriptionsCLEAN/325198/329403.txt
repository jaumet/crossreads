  
 1 Dec, 1916 Bayoud I'll do a bit of scribbling to use up the last bit of light left to the day, its a grey evening, quite exceptional here & the crescent moon usually so bright just has an occasional dim glimpse of us.  Ive had a lazy day been reading all the day.  Buezie came in with a "wire" to the effect that El Arish was to be taken shortly & the Light horse would then shift to a  new  front,  The "tale" is so old that it ought to be sung to the tune Annie Laurie or some thing of the like.  Harold has had a most wonderful excess of energy lately,  He & Mc have clipped all the troop horses, they finished up today with the aid of the machines.
