 The engine &amp; tender ready for service weighing 127 tons. My work was away at the ballast pit, with a rake of trucks which had to be loaded up by the Marion Steam Shovel. The train cosisted of 30 open trucks &amp; after they were shunted up along side of the shovel, by a signal the trucks were drawn down as the shovel filled them, every shovel full of ballast weighed 1 ton &amp; a truck was loaded in less than two minutes. 
 This Marion Steam Shovel is a wonderful invention, one man controls the movement of the shovel into the ballast &amp; one man swings the apparatus around &amp; unloads the ballast into the trucks &amp; another man attends to the firing &amp; keeping up the supply [of] water in the boiler. The whole lot of trucks were loaded up in less than one hour &amp; then drawn away &amp; taken down into the shunting yard to go away on the Nord line somewhere, then another lot of trucks were taken around &amp; also loaded up &amp; in due course were also dispatched on the Nord line.
