<p>a mile from the shore. The coast is very hilly &amp; looks covered with lovely green trees. It was simply beautiful on deck yesterday. The Captain of the boat is a fine fellow &amp; remembers Ella. I believe he is very much in love with a nurse that went on the last trip of the Kyarra.<br/>I'm not at all interested in any of our officers &ndash; neither is Dorothy. The sisters from the other states are very fond of the men, but we are all a happy family. I wish we could get some home letters at [censored] but no such luck. It is horrid not seeing the daily papers. Wonder how the war news is. Hope you are all well &amp; mind you write every mail, the letters will be forwarded to us where-ever we are. I shall write some more letters to my friends at next port of call. How did you enjoy your little rest at Tourquay?   Hope the weather was good &amp; that Eddy was able to go in bathing. Did Belle &amp;  Ethel manage to have a few days, I hope they did. We shall all be pleased when we get to work, but having a fine rest. Having a Fancy Dress Ball next week &amp; all kinds of amusements now. Have a Sports Committee formed.</p>
