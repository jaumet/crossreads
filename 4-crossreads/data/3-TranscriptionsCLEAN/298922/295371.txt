Marched on to BAYOUD - do you remember me telling you of our first fight here early in June last year 8 months ago - The sand hummocks have blown a bit but I never expected to be here again. However the Yeomanry left their Tents standing & also some SCENT Candles, a bottle of Beer etc. We were very glad to have such good accommodation. I don't feel much older but I know I look it. I only hope ere another year comes around I may be home in Australia with my new wife even if it is to fight Droughts, Fires, Floods etc.
TELL JOE I am sure Dolly would like a letter from him.
