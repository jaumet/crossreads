<p>the Camp is seething with discontent &amp; only wants a little match to start the mob going, they can't do what they like with the Australians, all the men swear they are not going to go on parade &amp; I only hope they stick to it.  Had a very small Dental List last night &amp; I soon finished, then Lindsay &amp; I went for a walk down to Sutton Veney, it is lovely over here of an evening strolling down the leafy &amp; flower strewn roads &amp; lanes.  Our usual medical inspection &amp; classification was held today, I went up before old Von Hagen as one of the examing Drs here is commonly called he marked me the same as before B.I.A.2 he gave me a haul over with his instruments  I am getting much stronger now &amp; am beginning to feel very fit, only I am very weak &amp; sweat freely.</p>
