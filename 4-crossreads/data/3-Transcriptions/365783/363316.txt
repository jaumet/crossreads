On one of the decks a boxing ring has been fixed up &amp; every afternoon at six some ding dong battles take place.   We have not yet had a fan installed in our cabin, apparently the one belonging to the cabin is broken beyond repair &amp; there are no spare ones on the ship.   I have already had proof ample of the value of giving tips all round at the commencement of the voyage.   Bath towels at the present moment are at a premium, each officer is allowed one coarse towel every other day.   The bath steward informed me of this &amp; at the same time winked his eye &amp; advised me that as far as I was concerned the rule could be disregarded as he would see that both a face towel &amp; a soft body towel would be available for me each morning.   Bang goes another ten bob.    The pound that I bestowed on the table steward fell I fear on rocky ground &ndash; he is very willing but very stupid.   The pourboire to Lance Corp.
