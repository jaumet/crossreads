again sent a few shells in the close vicinity of this camp.There was an inspection of all the mares in the Transports yesterday, with a view to picking out all suitable for breeding. Two were selected. This looks like as if the Government expected the war to end soon.Just as we were going to dinner the Transports got orders to move to a new camp near the Battalion & not very far from our old camp at Hamel Hill. We hastly packed up and got everything away including the G.M. Store & our tents up before dark. We had fine weather for the shift and only about 21/2 or 3 miles at the most to go. We passed through hilly country all the way along a winding road, we passed several new weather board Estaminets which the enterprising Belgains erected for the mutual benefit of the troops and themselves. The scenery was very picturesque farm houses & camps all the way, interspersed with Estaminets, and at one place we passed within a few chains of the French frontier, a long pole finished about near the end & weighted marking the barrier which was used in peacetimes to intercept traffic by the customs. Now it is pointing heavenwards & all & sundry may come & go as they please.
