Villers au Flos, at one time must have been a very <strike>f</strike> pretty place, standing in a small wood. Every building is in ruins, I think the most of the houses here have been wrecked by fritz himself. There was at one time a very fine chateau in the village, but now in ruins, like the rest. We are in a dugout just outside, there are plenty of them about here, a good many have had their entrances blown in, &amp; others have been burnt out., still there are a few still in good order, we are afraid that some of them have been mined &amp; blown up in three places, &amp; trees have also been felled accross the roads to hinder the traffic., they are all in very bad order.
