<p>I would love to have a [indecipherable] at the children playing with their hoops in the Park.<br/>I am at present sitting in my tent surrounded by a new mosquito net suspended from a hoop attached to the fly of the tent.   I attached a lot of little lead weights to the skirt of the net.    The chair &amp; I must manage to fit in nicely under the net.   I smoke the pipe in peace &amp; write this epistle &amp; outside the flies storm with impotent rage.    Some of the other officers have just spotted me &amp; reckon that I look like a bride.   Fancy the grapes not ripening at the Wurley &ndash; they should have cut off a lot of the leaves<br/>I like the way you ended your last letter<br/>"God keep you from your loving old Mrs."<br/>I will be looking forward to a cable from you about the 14th inst. in reply to mine &amp; sincerely hope we will be able to arrange for you all to come to Egypt.  You must make all arrangements for plenty of money to be forwarded on to you &ndash; you will find it pretty expensive here.<br/>Good bye dear old sweetheart &amp; God bring you to your loving husband<br/>Will.</p>
