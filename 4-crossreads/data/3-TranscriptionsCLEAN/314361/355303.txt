  
 They have one very large hotel. (The Grand Continental) which is an [indecipherable] place. Last night I watched some conjuring tricks done in front of this hotel. Sunday Dec 5th Have today visited the Pyramids. There are nine. The largest of all is the Cheops, buildt by King Cheops in the year 3733 BC. The height is 451 ft. The second is the 2nd King of the 40th dynasty it is 440 feet high. We  high  hired a guide to show us round his charge was 5 Pt. each, [indecipherable] it was well worth it. We first inspected some tombs then on to the sphinx. The sphinx is even older than the pyramids cut out of the solid rock. it has the face of a man & the head of a woman. Its nose was broken by Napoleon, the mark where the canon ball struck is easily seen. We were taken inside the third pyramid, & inspected a tomb of some king, a chamber made in [indecipherable] & from large solid blocks of marble. How they got these blocks into position I could not see. We did not climb up any of the pyramids being too tired. We had our photos taken on camels in front of the sphinx.
