  
 4. so I am doing my best to get a light car to take the boy down to the Pasteur Institute. I am afraid there is a good chance of him going out altogether before he reaches Paris and Paris is the only  place where any thing can be done for him. 
 My horse is likely to be demobilised any day now. I shall be dreadfully sorry to lose her, she has been a great friend to me and has been with me for over three years 
 My Medical officer is in bed sick and my Dental officer is nearly driven mad with toothache. I suppose that is just as it should be 
 Best Love Yours affectionately C.R. Lucas
