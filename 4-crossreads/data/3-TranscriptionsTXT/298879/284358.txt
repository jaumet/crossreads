 April 1915 Saturday 10 Weather still dull Lots of chaps have been ashore. They say that the Hospital tents are very full. Nearly all the patients have pneumonia they say. The town or village has a few shops but looks like a  "has-been" . The women all wear shawls. The price of all things being judged by the price of beer, they say that beer is 3 piastres per bottle. Many French soldiers are here. They have a long thin, three cornered bayonet &amp; a long rifle.
