<p>on August the 8th last, such villages as La Motte &amp; Villers Bretnaux, (mentioned a lot in the papers at the beginning of the Stunt) were passed.   From Oisement we marched to a dead &amp; alive village called Biencourt, arrived there at 5 p.m. &amp; enjoy a good hot meal. Our cooks had gone on ahead in one of our Ambulance cars, &amp; had everything ready for the troops. A fine chateau we are billeted in, an ideal spot for troops, it will make a fine home for the Winter. The country surrounding the Chateau was looking beautiful, after living amongst ruined villages etc. for so long, you can bet that we all appreciate to the full the fine scenery. After living here a few days we had the place very comfortable &amp; a fine Recreation Room was established. The village that we are in cannot even boast of a shop, so you can guess how exciting it must be. To-day is the 3rd Anniversary of my leaving Sydney for Melbourne. That stirring night, at the Central Railway Station, I shall never forget.</p>
<p>10th October 1918 &ndash; 3rd November 1918.<br/>Our quarters are now looking splendid &amp; today the Recreation Room was opened with a Bridge Tournament. In the afternoon I visited the small town of Oisement &amp; made a few purchases.  Splendid War news to hand that Cambrai had at last fallen, &amp; that the enemy was retreating in disorder, in the vicinity of that town. Came across Albert Whipp today, he was looking very well. During the next ten days nothing of a startling nature occurred at the Chateau.</p>
