into Randwick hospital for six weeks, from which place I received my discharge.  While at Randwick I had a good time, the sisters there were very good to us.I received my discharge on the 3rd November 1917 and it was the little piece of paper I had been looking forward too for a long while.Of course I have had an exceptionally good time throughout my travels & I hope I have the luck to be able to repeat my lot again minus the war part.4014A.
