  
 10 March 1918 Sunday Borrowed a boot from a Machine gunner as mine was worn right through on the rocks- We were well shelled getting into Camp but the Turks are retiring, we killed a few, but the country as rough as the worst of Switzerland near [indecipherable]-  Our own horses are packed for return & it is raining hard-  I still have a bottle flask of whisky to drink now & then.  The  Bedouin wooden ploughs from the Jordan Valley provide us with wood- The scenery!!! is grand- but our poor Horses suffer badly from bruised feet-  see paper 11th 12th 13th 14th
