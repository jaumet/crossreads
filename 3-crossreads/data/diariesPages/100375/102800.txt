drive us safely to our destination. When we reached Blendecques we found only a paddock with and a tent there of all our belongings we having been about the first to arrive. We lay under a tarpaulin all night in the field, and we had a rough reception from aeroplane bombs. A few people were killed in St Omer a town a few miles from here.
April 13th.Got our O.T. tent and fixed it up ready for emergency.
April 14th.Changed all our gear into another tent. Told to be ready to-night for operations. At five o'clock we got our orders to pack up a few instruments and (and) operating table to go to a place called Eblingheim to do operating work. The excitement of the previous days had given me a splitting headache, a thing that is becoming a regularity. The officers getting to hear of this prevented me from going and with this I was more than pleased
April 16th.The trekking of the civilian population seems to have dropped to-day.
April 18th.Visited St Omer. This ancient and historical city is only 3 or 4 miles from here. Went and saw the Cathedral and also had a walk through the spacious public gardens. Saw the houses on which the bombs dropped the night that we arrived here The roads are very busy, in and around
