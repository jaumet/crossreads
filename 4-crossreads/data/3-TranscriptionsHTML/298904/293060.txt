<p>once across this bridge we had a walk of nearly 2 miles to where our Battalion was camped &amp; very glad we were when we reached it.<br/>I did not see Len here for the Coy. were away down the Canal, &amp; did not come back for nearly a week .<br/>This was about the worst place I have ever seen life here was just an existence &amp; thats all every day there would be a severe dust storm which would fill every thing with dust, &amp; the days were hot as fire, the only redeeming  feature about this place was the swimming in the Canal we used to go down nearly every day &amp; have a good swim</p>
