November 191610th   I have been on the construction of the drain we located a few days ago, superintending about 300 infantry men of the 7th Brigade.The weather has been beautiful all day & we have witnessed numerous air duels between our own planes and Fritz's.  About 2 P.M. I saw one of his planes brought down in flames near Longueval & about an hour later another was forced to decend, but landed in his own lines.11th   I am still on the construction of the drain & have had the same infantry party as yesterday.  The weather has been fairly cold all day & a heavy fog came up this
