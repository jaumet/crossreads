1916 Wednesday 26 Jan.
Cool southerly wind blowing all day. Dagging Point sheep in woolshed yards & got 30 ration sheep out of them in morning Linda & self drove down to Middle paddock bore & then up to the place where "our home" is to be. We both wish it could be commenced [completed overwritten by commenced] at once. Took some photos of the place. Came home through Wheelers & 4D. My last night at home before sailing, was wondering when & under what conditions I would next see 4D. [any?] I ought to have some very fine experience before I get back again.
