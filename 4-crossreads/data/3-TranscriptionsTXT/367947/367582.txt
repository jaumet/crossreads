We do a lot of riding & jumping. You can imagine your humble as a cross country rider & yet strange to say I've been complimented on having a good seat in the saddle. It often falls to my lot to lead the way over the country for our troop & two or three times I've had to close my teeth tight to keep my heart from coming right out. Am in great fettle & so far it has done me the world of good.
We have picked up a lot of our back debt now & have nearly finished the furniture. Lizzie is living in a room at a friend's of Mrs French's. She is starting to look fine now that the debts are getting out of sight here. She hasn't much desire to go home to the Hill & is going to stay here
