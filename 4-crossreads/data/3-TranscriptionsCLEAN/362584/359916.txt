 My dear Mrs Ferguson 
 Thank you so much for repeating Ronald's cable on to me yesterday - but I am at a loss to understand it - I don't know what he means by saying "returned to duty" - I did not know he had been away, did you? - I wonder if he had been sick again - I have not had a letter from him for a long time. 
 I am glad to say my other two wounded lads are progressing favourably, Willie the elder of the two is on furlough - Jack is still in France - I had a letter by this mail from Willie written in Hospital, telling me how the accident occurred - they were in action in front of Amiens, had been there for two days & in the afternoon of the 3rd day about 2 o'clock they were very busy with their Gun - firing 4 rounds to the minute. Willie was taking the time & Jack laying the fuse - then all at once Willie said he found himself hit the ground - he got up at once & ran towards his brother, & he said great
