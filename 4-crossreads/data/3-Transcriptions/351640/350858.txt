You remember how excellent Mr. Sparks (R.I.P.) was in that regard, well friend Williams constantly reminds me of my former friend.   Rude words are often so rounded off that they convey no offence.   Sparks never used strong language.   Williams interlards all his sentences with the very strongest.</p>
<p>'Memberest <strike>though</strike> thou how a 'ticker friend to me once said "Me!   Me!  Me! Nicey Nan. Nan Nan."</p>
