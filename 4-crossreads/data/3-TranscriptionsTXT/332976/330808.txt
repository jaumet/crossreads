 March 1917 8th.   I started consolidating the entrances of the deep dugouts at "Bull's Eye Trench" by digging a trench &amp; building a parapet in front of them to prevent against a "direct hit"   Fritz has been shelling us rather heavy all day &amp; there have been a considerable number of casualties around here. The weather has been very cold th  during the last two days &amp; it has been snowing all day, with a cold biting wind from the north blowing.   Last night we received word that all dugouts between "Needle Trench" &amp; "MillerSon Post" were to be fitted with gas-proof doors in antisipation of a heavy gas attack from "Fritz," &amp; We are to work in shifts day and night until they are completed.
