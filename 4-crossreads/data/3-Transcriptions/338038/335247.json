<p>in one big show, the battle of Fromelles, just south of Armentieres. It was about the hottest thing I have seen while it lasted. (About 2 days).<br/>They say one lives &amp; learns. I am quite sure I never knew what Artillery was till I came here. The Bosche has splendid artillery &amp; handles it like a tradesman, but the British, they are superb! We have been in many different parts of the line and everywhere the R.F.A. is a "household" word.</p>
<p>I have been rather careful about making statements about war prospects etc. but from what one can see here, I am convinced the Bosche has just about "lost his punch". He may attack us again but I think he must be getting pinched for men, and will be mainly on the defensive henceforth, though the pushing of him will not be "beer &amp; skittles" as his system</p>
