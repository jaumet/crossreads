<p>Dear Mr. Horsfield &ndash;<br/>Do you think you could assist Mrs. Wright with her [indecipherable] Bill &ndash; She applied some weeks ago but did not get assistance. I am trying to get her husband an invalid pension. She has 7 children at home, one too delicate to work the other 14 earns a few shillings but not regularly &ndash; It seems a rather distressing case as the husband at present is quite unfit for work.</p>
<p>You will have your own report but this bill is pressing otherwise she does not complain.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully<br/>B. Booth</p>
