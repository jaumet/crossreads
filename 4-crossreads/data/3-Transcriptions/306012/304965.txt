<p>little or no tact since taking over the draft tried a little bluff but we stood firm.  An inquiry was opened and the food has improved somewhat.<br/>Further irritation has been caused by two wires received from Fremantle.  One stating that we should have to undergo quarantine on arrival &amp; the other saying that a payment of &pound;9 ration allowance on board to all ranks was cancelled.<br/>On the morning of the 13th the transport arrived in the roadstead outside Fremantle but on account of the strict quarantine regulations no-one landed.
