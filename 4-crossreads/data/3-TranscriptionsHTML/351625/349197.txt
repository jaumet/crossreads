<p>it may take me all my time to keep you posted up in news.  I hope Father's leg is better by now &amp; does not give him any more trouble also hope you are keeping well and not worrying over me too much as I am quite alright &amp; will take every care of my skin.  Give all my best love &amp; kisses with whips to yourself.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving son<br/>Douglas</p>
