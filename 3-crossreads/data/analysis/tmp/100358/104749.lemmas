Next day we march to the train near by , and proceed to a villag some mile back call Ribemont . He [here ] we turn in to billet . It was like heaven to us . We were paid , and the villag shop , kept by French women , did a roar trade . Porridg other wholesom fill food the boy bought in plenti , and cook in all kind of improvis stove . The sick parad howev , was veri larg and minor ailment of all kind show how the hardship of the line had found the weak spot . Perhap bad feet and diarrhoea were the most preval . But in a marvel short time we had the dirt off and were again look as tho ? we were realli capabl of give Fritz troubl . For three day we did practic noth . After that , a programm of drill , parad ground drill was arrang , and we settl down . The afternoon were spent in the footbal field , at which our Battalion prove champion of the Brigad , both in the Officer Men 's match . The billet were of the roughest kind . How differ to all I had imagin . We simpli occupi the unus barn outhous of the villag . We rare saw the owner . But the real comfort was to be among the Estaminet , Boulangeri , and shop again , and to be abl to supplement our armi ration . We were taken too , to the division bath at Heali , a villag not far away , and here had a much need warm bath and chang of undercloth . But oh ! a few night in those billet and we were as " chatti " as ever . The rat too are simpli the cheekiest thing I have met among the rodent tribe . They walk on your chest while asleep , and eat your ration unless you hang them from the roof . But they are not so bad as in the dugout trench where the live in hoard .
