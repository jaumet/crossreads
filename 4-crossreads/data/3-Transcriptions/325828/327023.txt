<p>This naturally entails a tremendous lot of work &amp; we are kept hard at it all the week including Saturday all-day, until midday Sunday.  A few days ago, I received a duplicate book in place of the one I reported lost but this has since been handed in with the others.  This work is congenial to me under the circumstances.  Before, I used to strike some very heavy fatigues, some of which were beyond my strength.  I am feeling as fit as a fiddle at present &amp; am feeling quite able to take up my work in France again.  However I am quite content to let this question be settled by the Military authorities here.  If the Quack decides I am fit for active service again, well &amp; good<br/>I think in one of my previous letters I mentioned that all my parcels have gone astray.  This is probably accounted for by the fact that being away from my Unit in France, they have gone to France, &amp; have not been re-directed, being opened</p>
