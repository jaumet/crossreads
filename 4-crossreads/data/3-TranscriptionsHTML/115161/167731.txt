<p>luggage down and left the ship till the following day.</p>
<p>It was hard, very hard to bid farewell to the people who had been so kind to me, they came down to the wharf and saw me off, and were rowed over to the boatside later.&nbsp; Their house had been my home for the past twelve months, and they had been my true friends.&nbsp; The comforts and pleasures of their house, their true friendship, their openhearted hospitality, their untiring efforts to make my life enjoyable, had been given to me, a perfect stranger.&nbsp; My appreciation it is not possible for me to show, my gratitude too heartfelt to express, but they and their kind actions will ever be in my memory.</p>
<p><u>CHAPTER XL11</u>.</p>
<p><u>HOME AGAIN.</u></p>
<p>On May 20th. 1920 at about 9 a.m. I left London accompanied by my friends, and arrived at Tilbury about an hour later.&nbsp; The fine German-built steamer lay in mid-stream, so after bidding farewell I stepped on the tug and was soon on board the ship which was to be my home for the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The many womenfolk who were also going to Australia came down later, some were travelling with their soldier husbands, others were making the journey alone to join their life partners, while a goodly number were leaving their homes in England to enter the bonds of matrimony on their arrival in the sunny climes of Australia.</p>
<p>As the ship was not due to leave before about four o&#39;clock in the afternoon, my friends were pulled across to the boatside, but were not allowed on board.</p>
<p>At about the time appointed we weighed anchor, and started to move slowly down stream, passing some of the places I had visited.&nbsp; There was a general waving of flags, handkerchieves, and anything else which would make a show.</p>
