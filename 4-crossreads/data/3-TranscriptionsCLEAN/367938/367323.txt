Anzac Possy1.6.15.
- - - - - & families -Very windy & papers blow about & dust lodges every where so cannot write much - Theres not much to say except continued good health - Have slid down the hill to a new bivouac in the Valley gully - very pretty. Relieved on top for some days. Must send a photo of our new Hdqrs -
Slipped on board the "Sicilia" the other day & had a glorious lunch with Graham & 2 nurses - Every thing so clean - had beer at lunch! Capt is D. Shone - a cousin & very nice. On board they have pillows, serviettes & I actually saw the use of handkerchiefs, wh unnecessary conceit I have long since done without. Came back with 2 bottles of Irish whiskey - coffee - 4 envelopes & a tighter belt.
The food here however is varied by the supply splendidly - a good achievement - sometimes dried figs & prunes - fresh beef - lentils. A canteen ship is coming with everything, & life may now be devoted to cooking in earnest & handfuls of pills from the drs.
I left with Graham, to be sent to you,
