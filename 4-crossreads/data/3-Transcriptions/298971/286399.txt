<p>I doubt whether it would be possible to go all round the place in one day.  Tram lines are not used but trams run up with stores at night.  We were put into a big Hospital building at present occupied by the Scots whom we are to relieve.  This unit is composed of all branches including some from the Black Watch.  Wandered round the city at night up to 8 pm.  The trenches are very close by &amp; occasionally the Germans throw shells in though our building hasn't been touched.</p>
