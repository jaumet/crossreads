<p>I hope dear Mother is quite well now   &amp;  will take care of herself. We must try   &amp;  get her out a bit while I'm home. Trust I shall be able to get a fortnight's furlough. It will be hard if I don't get it.</p>
<p>Hope the Thomas family are better. Annie is a marvel, the way she works   &amp;  keeps so cheerful. My fondest love to her   &amp;  I shall write if possible.</p>
<p>Received a nice Xmas Card from dear old Jess March the other day. Give my love to all my friends. Hope they are all well. I wonder if I shall see Ella, hope she will be successful in her school.</p>
<p>The Food question is very serious here. Tea, Sugar, butter, milk   &amp;  meat very scarce. It is dreadful to see the crowds lined up with their tickets outside these shops. We have to be very careful in hospital but not feeling it much yet.</p>
<p>Fondest live   &amp;  kisses to you all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
