Houses.
We are about 1/2 mile from the other offices & incidentally from my medical outfit. I am not looking forward to walking in & out when the rain commences as I am no great walker, at any time. But we are free from bugs etc and from mosquitoes - the houses are full of the latter.
This is a great place for water. A large canal runs from the lake - about 7 miles S of Homs. through the town and empties further N into the Orontes River. Every house has its well - all good water except that it is contaminated by the inevitable filthy habits of the Arab population.
Last night a cloud burst occurred somewhere up in the hills and a torrent of water came down a wadi - previously dry & literally swamped the town out. I could not get in from here for some hours this morning & when I did get across after it went down somewhat I found the streets under water in many places.
It is still running but almost petered out this evening
