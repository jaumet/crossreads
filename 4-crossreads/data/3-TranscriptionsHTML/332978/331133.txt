<p>54 Septr 5th<br/>see that we received treatment &ndash;</p>
<p>When questioned about the Dutch Exchange he said that the whole thing was being held up on account of the two Govts not being able to come to some decision as regards what route the transports would take &ndash;</p>
<p>I am specially glad that the Dutch minister came especially for Robinson &amp; Berlines sakes as they are being grossly unjustly treated &ndash; The Commdt informed Robinson that a neutral was representing them on the Court when Robinson acquainted the minister of this fact, he was astonished  said that such was not the case as nothing had ever been heard of their case in Holland. So we all welcomed this visit, he arrived just at a very opportune time &ndash; he promised there would be a marked alteration soon, as this place was really not fit for a camp.</p>
<p>The Commdt &amp; staff here were very affable during his visit, despite the fact they were all wearing very worried looks &ndash;</p>
<p>Rafe &amp; Slee (Australian) attempted an escape last evening but were caught just as they were leaving the court yard &ndash; they have been awarded 6 days cells.</p>
