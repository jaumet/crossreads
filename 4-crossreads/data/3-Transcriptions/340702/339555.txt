<p>here because then we do not hear those huge Gothas roaring overhead looking for likely possies to lay their eggs, while we are shivering &amp; quaking below. At Querrieu every clear night is like a Battle between Bombs, Antiaircraft guns, Machine guns, &amp; every Swaddy who has a little spare ammunition having a go on his own. We left Querrieu with a party of Carpenters including myself to start a new Dump near Vignacourt today.</p>
<p>Tuesday 16/4  I have been with Sgt Wilson these last few days. He is a member of the Westralian Labour Party. He looks like a mascot being only about 5 Feet high. One of his Sons  <strike>are</strike>  is buried at Bernafay Wood. Another has been horribly wounded and returned to Australia. I hurt his feelings very much by a remark that I made about the wounded one.</p>
<p>Bobs grave is behind Fritzs lines now. The Indians over here have to be buried with their heads to the west so they may face the East. In a Cemetary alongside here one of them had to be buried outside so that this rule could be observed</p>
<p>17/4  Vignacourt is now full of French Soldiers they have come from Lorraine where the 66th U.S.A. Division relieved them. Like the rest of the French people they cannot get Tobacco &amp; hang around our Canteens asking us to buy Cigarettes for them, because the Canteen will only serve British Troops.</p>
