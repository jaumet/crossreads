<p>no small amount of uneasiness. His base depots, camps, various Headquarters and all the other 'targets' referred to above were now within the range of our 'planes' and he knew from past experience that he could safely look forward to being provided with frequent and very tangible proof of this fact. His perturbation was evidenced by the hasty removal or splitting up of certain camps, the use of all manner of 'camouflage' and the concentration of Anti-Aircraft batteries at various points, concerning which more will be said later.</p>
<p>It was not very long before the enemy had the real meaning of this new menace very forcibly impressed upon him. While out on a reconnaissance, two of the largest of the German aerodromes were located at EL AFULE by Capt. R.M. Smith M.C. (pilot) and Lieut. E.A. Mustard (Observer).  On January 3rd the flying unit stationed there were duly notified that their haunt had been discovered. Eight of our machines, escorted by Lieut. R.A. Austin, M.C. (pilot) Lieut. L.W. Sutherland M.C.  D.C.M. together with about the same number from Royal Air Force Squadrons visited the aerodrome and dropped 1,2000-lbs. of bombs with excellent results. Fifteen hangars were counted, and several bombs were observed to drop in the midst of these structures, while one bomb was seen to drop in the cockpit of a two-seater machine that was standing on the aerodrome and explode.</p>
<p>Our formation was attacked by a number of enemy scouts that were seen to 'take off' on the approach of our machines. One of these was shot down out of control by Lieut. R.A. Austin M.C. (pilot) Lieut. L.W. Sutherland, MC., D.C.M. (Observer) flying a Bristol Fighter; while a second enemy aircraft was driven down by Lieut. A .R. Brown (pilot) and Lieut. O.M. Lee (Observer) flying a R.E.8. All our machines returned safely.</p>
<p>It was learned subsequently from Turkish prisoners that on this raid, 40 of the enemy were killed and an ammunition store exploded.<br/>The same day two machines bombed boats and sheds at EL KELAT on the DEAD SEA where considerable damage was done.  These boats which were mostly motor-craft, were employed carrying wheat and fodder grown on the plains East and South East of the DEAD SEA, for the use chiefly of the enemy troops operating in the neighbourhood of the JORDAN VALLEY and AMMAN. A noteworthy fact in connection with this raid was that the bombing was carried out several hundred feet below sea level, the target being minus 1,200 feet. Similar attacks on these boats, of which there was a fleet of about 30, were carried out until the service was discontinued. On several occasions our machines, upon observing these little craft en route between Ports, went down and sprayed them with machines gun fire from a few hundred feet, causing no small amount of panic amongst those on board. With the prospect of an experience of this kind ever present, the discontinuance of the service was not altogether surprising.</p>

<p>On the 4th January a formation of 17 machines, 10 of which were from 1st Squadron, raided the German Aerodrome at JENIN, where Scout Flights were reported to be located.
