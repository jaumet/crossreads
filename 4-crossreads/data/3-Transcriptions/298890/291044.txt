<p>3 Sunday<br/>Went down to dinner with Maud &amp; back to tea at Smith family party.  First helped Ethel. She was so sick.  Poured all day.  Started work at 7.30 a.m. &amp; got Sam bound &amp; corrected</p>
<p>4 Monday<br/>Took Sam to Watt &amp; Son.  Trudged to bank &amp; various places in pouring rain.  Got home &amp; cleared up various odds &amp; ends. Very tired afterwards hard struggle trying to type &amp; earn living</p>
<p>5 Tuesday<br/>Lovely early morning like yesterday.  Stanley's suggestion of  "Down Under" came. Kept an hour late so got home too tired to sleep.</p>
<p>6 Wednesday<br/>Twilight day.  Sat in the hopeless muddle &amp; did a little shorthand.  Searchlight wonderful glory at night</p>
