<p>December 21, 22<br/>"In The Key of Blue" &ndash; Elkin Mathews, 8/6.</p>
<p>Christmas night programme completed, with a tail piece by Ken of the Chateau towers and Archway.</p>
<p>Today the Count shews his good judgment of men:  he away to Brussels with Col. Marks.</p>
<p>Early morning, and Ken, Hardy and Gordon of the Sigs. (-- or of the "Many Leaves"!) about the Chateau drives, in shorts and Staff Caps, "What Athletes these strange "Australians" are!"</p>
<p>December 22<br/>5.<br/>An ill report on the achievement of the Committee.  From the Canteen George unable to buy the two cases of Whisky.  He in tonight, and a re-yarning of arrangements:  Tomorrow to go out buying &ndash; he, Mac, and I &ndash; vegetables, tinn'd stuff and Fowls.  Tonight around to "Q" and find they have already arranged with the Count's buyer for a Keg of Beer &ndash; for themselves:  so we commandeered it, and ordered again two barrels.</p>
<p>Mail, a syllabus of the School of Architecture from the Liverpool University.  Will see Vin, a so-so Catalogue from Heffen of Cambridge, and a parcel of books &ndash; including Pater and Plato &ndash; from Mrs. H.</p>
<p>Up to the 'Mons' girl Estaminet with George, E. &amp; B. and Mac:</p>
