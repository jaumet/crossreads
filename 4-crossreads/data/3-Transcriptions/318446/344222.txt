<p>right, indeed, from what I know it seems to be right.</p>
<p>About 11th Jan.<br/>Two 'plane raids since I last wrote, but both very feeble affairs consisting of only three bombs each.  We have more A.A. guns out here now &amp; they have got them thinking all right, so now we seem to be fairly secure from them.  Just finished my bi-weekly drink &ndash; they give us rum twice a week now.  I am getting to like it though the only way is to take it neat as it is poisonous stuff when diluted, tasting so terribly crude as compared with whiskey.<br/>No whisper of another stunt yet, though I expect there will be one soon.  They are making this place a second Romani with barbed wire redoubts, etc. etc.</p>
