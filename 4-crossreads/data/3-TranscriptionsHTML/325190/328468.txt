<p>Monday 5 Nov 17<br/>Were paid on Friday<br/>On Saturday at 11 AM Gray &amp; I with Eva &amp; another 3rd man known as Pinky, set out for the 3rd Fld Amb. at Boechepe near Poperinge.<br/>A slight halt for refreshments was made at Fletre, where we discussed the Italian question with some pessimistic Tommies, &amp; a bright Belgian girl.<br/>At Mont de Cats we had a good dinner at a cottage in which were some refugees from Whytchaete.  This cottage was near the Monastery part of which is now a Canadian Casualty Clearing station.  One of the Belgian ladies contradicted the story of German atrocities at Mont de Cats, but did not satisfy me.</p>
