<p>march and the weight I carried.&nbsp; As it was my legs started to chafe, my feet to ache and my spirits to fall to zero.&nbsp; I had been so clean for the past week or two.&nbsp; My finger nails had almost regained their correct shape, and I had succeeded in partially locating the -at one time - perfectly straight parting in my hair.</p>

<p><u>MAMETZ</u>.</p>
<p>This camp is much like Friecourt and Bazantine, in that it had good huts, duckboards to walk on in the camp grounds, water laid on, canteen and many other things which tend to improve the conditions of the soldier.</p>
<p>One Sunday afternoon a few of us walked to Albert, a few miles away.&nbsp; The town was practically empty, all the civilians having left some time previously, with the exception of a few who still risked the continuous bombardment, to carry on their little &quot;egg and chip&quot; joints.</p>
