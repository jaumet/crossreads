28/8/17 Campagne
A very black and unpleasant day. The battalion formed up in mass at 9.15 am but a shower came on and the wind was unpleasantly strong so I sent the coys home to their billets. Today was a foretaste of winter with falling leaves The Swallows crouched under the house and commenced to think of their southern journey. Stayed inside practically all day very busy doing nothing. The padre entered a suggestion regarding ?La Vie Parisienne"and I acceded on the grounds that it is too warm for the youth of the mess. Busy with Baedeker all the afternoon going over an Italian trip. M le Curie a fat priest has been here all the afternoon and village scandal is busy with his and that of mademoiselle. In the evening the weather cleared up a good deal and the wind dropped. Madame the owner of this house is very avaricious and out to get as much money as possible all the time. Barbier says "I ?ate dat woman!"
