(7th) just across the road from us what a din.<br/>It is unofficially reported that they got the Taube before mentioned hope it is true he would take some valuable information back else.

Fritz has been shelling consistently for the last few days but to-day he lobbed a high explosive 8 inch shell into the farriers shop of our 7th Coy. just across the road from us &amp; killed 5 men (including my old friend H.O. Wilkinson who was with me in the Ofice for a time) &amp; 16 horses. I hurried across &amp; what a sight met my gaze.</p>
