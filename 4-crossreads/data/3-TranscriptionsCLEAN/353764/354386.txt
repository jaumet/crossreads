Gurkha Troops came in to-day, which means that there must have been a fight down on the Canal.There is nothing much of importance to report here, as Heliopolis is very quiet.To-night as I sit on my bunk, I think of home & everybody, & wonder when I shall be back again.The War does not seem to be near its end, & no one ever thinks of it out here.  It is only when one thinks of Everybody they left at home, that you feel lonely & miserable.  Such is a Soldiers life.
24.1.16Rained very hard & nearly flooded us all out.  A peculiar thing of the storms we get over here, is the rapidity in which they rise & then go away again.We purchased a good Piano to-day for the boys (on the hire system) & have placed it in our Mess.  They are all over there Singing now & appear as happy as can be.  It is a marvel what music can do to brighten up things.Still not much news of the war.
