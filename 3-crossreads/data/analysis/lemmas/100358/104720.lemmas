 disembark . The sea the whole way from Cape Town has been littl differ to the averag trip to Watson 's Bay . The Bay of Biscay was as calm as Sydney Harbour . All around me as I write sit the lad wait for lunch and then ? disembark . A few fatigu parti are pack kit bag and blanket . The Quarter Master Sergeant has finish issu our iron biscuit ration , to last us for the come 24 hour . Just a few are make remark which show that they possess just a few emot relev to this phase of our trip . " Well , Bill there 's the old dart , the bit of dirt we re go to scrap for ; what yer opinion of it ? " That 's the finest littl littl piec of dirt you ll ever see my son " said a pommi . " You make me smile , dinkum you do you pommi rabbit . The best bit of dirt you left two month ago ? way down south , and there ought to be law for the stoppen of such as you get there again . Chew that " . But the major are most concern as to whether English beer will suit their palat , whether they will be abl to wet their whistl , which they say , is clog with Cape Town dust , or whether they will be paid given leav . Well , you would expect the men to be interest in these thing after two month on a troop ship . Its not all beer skittl I can assur you . A great say among the boy is this . Instead of say " good morn " they say " What do you know Jack ? " I heard the repli yesterday ? " Not to b---- much or I would not be here " ! Still , that is n't a real opinion it just a humour of the moment . We are draw nearer nearer our destin . Its foggi in this great ocean roadway but we should soon draw up to Eddyston and then it is n't long . The next time I add a few line to this book will probabl be in Salisburi plain Camp , but one never know . Although we hate this old boat , the A18 , she 's been a good home to us and we have had our littl joke althrough . So farewel Father Neptun you old traitor , with your German tin fish , onc more we have beaten you . And farewel to H.M.A.T. Wiltshir , ye nobl galleon who hath born us all these mile and who hath onc more evad the glassi eye of the afore-ment tin fish . Ahead of us is Plymouth Hoe with the banshe of old Drake watch us come nearer nearer , from the famous green . But we do n't forget the live Jellico who has watch us all these 14 thousand mile . And so I close .
