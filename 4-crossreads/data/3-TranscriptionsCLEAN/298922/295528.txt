 No. 14 A.G.H. Weighed this morning 12 st. 4 lbs. I've lost a stone & am very glad - getting A1, nice hot dry weather. 
 Many men have been in to see me, & it is a lazy luxurious existence. 
 The Ward holds 52 beds & if a Painter could put on Canvas the night sister at her central table with a Red Shaded Lamp writing up her returns etc:- & looking up now & again to the different Patients, the beds show up so white at nightime & it is all so very still. Some men are so bad with Septic Sores they look as tho' they were being embalmed, a mass of bandages like PTOLEMIES II on his stretcher - in MUSEUM.
