<p>Wednesday Sept 4th Paris</p>
<p>up at 6 am : caught the 8.25 am home via Amiens : the old town seems to have been knocked about a bit : two girls in the train were good company &amp; we had a great time : home to camp about 8.30 pm &amp; it is with rather a weary feeling : absolutely the finest holiday I have ever spent &amp; I wouldn't mind starting on another trip to Paris straight away : got 12 letters as my mail :</p>
