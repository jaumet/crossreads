This class of phone is next door to useless as each individual instrument requires the services of an expert mechanic to keep it in working order and they are always getting out of repair on account of the most important parts being exposed to the damp and dust. We are requisioning for D3 phones if procurable. Received a letter today through the adjutant relating to the circumstances surrounding the death of Signaller M. Spry who was blown to pieces close to me last November on Gallipoli I have been asked to render a statement giving the fullest particulars. The circumstances are very vividly impressed upon my memory  because the 8.2 " shell came down and burst with a deafening roar about 3 yards from me

 The late King Edward's birthday and 2 years ago today I stood on the flying bridge of the "Star of England" about 9.30 in the morning  and watched the "Sydney" make her wild dash out from the  flank of the convoy and go at full speed in a westerly direction to fight and smash up the German Cruiser "Emden"
