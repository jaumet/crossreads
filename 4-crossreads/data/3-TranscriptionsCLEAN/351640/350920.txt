Good bye my dears. God bless you[Lines of Xs and Os.]Tabbie. Joseph. Kitty.
10.7.15.   10.45. p.m.   This morning I sent to you a week end cable message to the following effect:  "Nash Sydney. Tell MacNamara papers posted.   Consult Finney re new solicitor.   Get all papers from Buchanan.  Well."   The first words refer to the giving to you girls power to deal with land matters, it will complete your power of attorney.   The second and third parts refer to the difficulty you have with Mr. buchanan.   He is perhaps becoming too well off, when I took him business first he was in a small way, he then married a good class woman, has been doing well ever since, and with the business of more than one brewery behind him, he and his partner must have been doing well for some years.

This afternoon a letter came from Mrs. Fraser, written at the Isle of Wight.  She reports all to be well with the Captain and herself.   She desired to be kindly remembered to you girls.
Still very busy with patients coming and going, nearly five hundred of them asleep on the verandahas and other places at this moment, some few seriously sick, but for the most part they are in the convalescing stage.
Under the feeding of Jerom my weight is increasing daily, and I feel first class, it is hard for me to imagine that I am really an old buffer, though it is evident to me that the boys here call me "The Old Man".   What does Kitty think of that?  Naughty boys I hear her remark.   Good.   Yet one must not deny so patent a fact, keeping hope that God will allow me to pull through this game, return home to You, and thereafter to spend some
