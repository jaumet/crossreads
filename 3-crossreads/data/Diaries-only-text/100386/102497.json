probably sour before the ovens would be ready to bake it.
Therefore 1 hour's allowance in time is made between each round baked off, or should this not be practicable, the difficulty may be overcome by other methods, the most common of which are a drop in the temperature of the water, or the addition of an amount of salt in accordance with the quantity of dough, as salt retards the action of the yeast plant, and by the former mentioned method a cooler made dough will always "travel" slower than one of higher temperature.
