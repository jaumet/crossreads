  
  Hospital France 27 Aug. 17 My dearest Sister, Again in Hospital - this time not wounded, not sick but injured - to cut out the trimmings I had my upper jaw fractured whilst playing football. My face is a picture a lovely black, bloodshoot eye, swollen face & sore jaw. To-morrow I go to England & when the face resumes its normal aspect will get leave again. It is worth while suffering a little to get the said leave. Well my dear excuse brevity this time - will write you when I get settled in "Blighty". Love to all From Ken
