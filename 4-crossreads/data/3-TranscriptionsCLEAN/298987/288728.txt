Disembarked about 9 a m & marched 3 miles (must call them miles now) to our Base Depot Had a good meal & were issued with the ballance of our kit Waterproof sheet & cape combined Rifle Tin Hat & I had enough to carry before What we saw of Harve it is a livly old place
Friday 25thIssuing the extra Kit yesterday was done more expeditiously than anything of that kind I have struck in the army. We marched straight through a hut & the things were passed out as fast as we could take them. Had to sleep in the YM Picture Show last night Saw the pictures first & then slept the sleep that is issued to small children & soldiers Had a march about 6 miles with full wads - No we have no ammunition - It was quite hot & the troops felt it. One has to put on a lot of clothing for the morning & after t you have marched a while with the Sun shining you warm up some. The tucker here is the best I have struck in the Army. Went to pictures to fill in time before turning in
