<p>A Canadian doctor, a Liet- Colonel &ndash; examined several of the patients in this ward  this afternoon. He spent about an hour examining one. He was very thorough.<br/>Thursday Jan. 16. 1919. (67).<br/>Fine but rather windy. I finished reading Mark Twain's "book" Crossing the Equator". The book written in a humorous style throughout describes the authors journey to Australia New Zealand, India and South Africa, finishing up at Southampton England. All through Mark Twain reveals his affection for democratic institutions, his hatred of shams and autocrasticy and his sympathy for the poor and opressed, though he says it costs him nothing.<br/>With 3 other diggers, I walked into Weymouth this evening. We had a walk around the town had tea there and walked back arriving before dark. Weymouth is 2 miles away, and with the walk through the town we completed about 5 miles by the time we got back. I bought some P.C. views of Weymouth.<br/>We saw a lot of Japanese sailors &amp; marines. There uniform is made in the pattern of the British. The non-commissioned officers badges of rank are the same anchor &amp; stripes in red.</p>
