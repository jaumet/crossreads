<p>20 Turks rushed part of the trench held by the 1st Battalion with bombs &amp; killed &amp; wounded a few.  One Turk a tremendous big fellow got into the trench &amp; got into grips with one of the sergeants.  Some other assisted &amp; held him down &amp; another shot him.  He had 4 loaves of bread &amp; 2 bottles of water  There was a good deal of bombing &amp; shortly after dark 4 of the 5th LH got struck with a bomb one getting his arm &amp; leg broken.  I went on at 9 oclock but it was fairly quiet then.  Came off at 11 &amp; went on again from 3 till 5 am.</p>
<p>Sunday 5th [Sept]<br/>Had a quiet day in the support trenches.  There is not much chance of sleeping as there are so many men in the trenches.  We sat about &amp; smoked &amp; yarned &amp; discussed whether John Turk would make his proposed attack.  Anyway we got a big supply of bombs handy</p>
