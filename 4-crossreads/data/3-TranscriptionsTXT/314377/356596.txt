Rifle, equipment, steel helmet, and not forgetting his souvenirs I met one of the Battalion at the Entrance. He had been wounded in the eye
My first night's lodging was at the Warchest Club. This was a big place very largely patronised by members of the A.I.F. I decided I would have photos taken and went to a place on the strand From there to the Anzac Buffet - here wrote a long letter home.
The "Buffet" was run by Aust ladies. The meals were free. I went to a play at night "Damaged Goods" The tickets were provided by the Buffet. The play to me was in the nature of a lecture.
