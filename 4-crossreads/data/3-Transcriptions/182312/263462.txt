<p><u>6th December, 1916.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since last writing I have set off on a trip</p>
<p>down to the Riviera to do some more convalescing.&nbsp; During the winter</p>
<p>months the South is much used as a convalescent district, principally</p>
<p>because the Army consider that they will get their Officers back to</p>
<p>work quicker this way than by leaving them in the fog and damp of the</p>
<p>North.&nbsp; It certainly suits Australians better as the climate is more</p>
<p>like their own.&nbsp; The journey from the North is a long one, but a</p>
<p>very interesting and pretty one.&nbsp; In pre war days the express train</p>
<p>from Calais and Boulogne to Paris was onsidered the fastest in the</p>
<p>World but now alas, the track has become much worn through heavy war</p>
<p>traffic and the rollling stock has not received the attention which at</p>
<p>one time was bestowed upon it, with the result that fast travelling is</p>
<p>out of the question and a journey involves a considerable amount of</p>
<p>shake and jolt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The former rather long-winded notice on the Railway</p>
<p>Stations warning soldiers against discussing war matters in the hearing</p>
<p>of strangers, has given place to the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;There once was an owl who lived in an oak,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;He saw quite a lot but seldom spoke,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;And the less he spoke the more he heard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Soldiers should imitate this wise old bird.&quot;</p>
<p>Rather a good effort I thought especially as it is well displayed in</p>
<p>large black lettering on white boards easily visible from the trains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abbeville is the first place of any size reached between</p>
<p>Boulogne and Paris and it is here that so many of the Somme wounded</p>
<p>were collected during the first couple of months of that offensive.</p>
<p>Here as we pass in the train we can see the Hospital barges, ten or a</p>
<p>dozen in number, moored to the river bank sinisterly awaiting the next</p>
<p>push.&nbsp; The swollen state of the rivers and canals would, in any case</p>
<p>prevent the running of the barges during the winter months.&nbsp; Barge No.</p>
<p>191 moored there amongst the others brings back to me my trip down from</p>
