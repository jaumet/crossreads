<p>27 Jan to 31st Jan<br/>In Indian Ocean</p>
<p>1 Feb 19<br/>Arrived Colombo, Ceylon. No leave granted, but the majority of the soldiers &amp; sailors went ashore on their own account. I climbed through the porthole &amp; down into an empty lighter &amp; went myself. The lighters were coming over to the ship full of coal &amp; going back full of soldiers.<br/>Needless to say we were not particular about our dress, most of the soldiers had no tunics &amp; our chaps were in overalls or anything they could get. The first thing that greeted us when we got ashore were the rickshaw men, all in a group outside the shippingyard gates. They were all clamouring after us to ride in their particular rickshaw. The rickshaws are built exactly like a sulkie only on a very small scale of course, as the men run along between the shafts &amp;</p>
