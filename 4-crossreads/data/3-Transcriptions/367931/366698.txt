<p>the fine work they have done for the Unit since I took them over. Am sorry I have not a D.A.C. order to bestow on them for their grand work. I sent them some of our Div Art souvenir cards, which I am sure they will appreciate. Hope some day to meet some of them &amp; thank them personally. We are just about fed up with the country &amp; people here. The latter resemble those around Reninghelst, so that an explanation is not necessary. It has rained here for ten days &amp; it makes one feel glad that Aussie is in sight. Well Colonel this is about all the "oil", so will close with kind regards &amp;  best wishes for the future from Cramp &amp; myself<br/>From<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>Alf. S. Ford<br/>P.S. Should you visit Victoria I am in Melbourne &amp; would like to see you any time. This address finds me<br/>A.S.F. Jnr<br/>"Wanda"<br/>Portsea<br/>Vic</p>
