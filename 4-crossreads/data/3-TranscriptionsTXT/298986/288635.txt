 Got 3 nice new white blankets &amp; a hammock this evening so am set up especially as I have a good place to hang it.  Have a fair amount of space on each side of me &amp; being right opposite the hatchway get some fresh air. 
 Sunday 23rd 
 Had an execelent night.  The hammock is just the thing to sleep in.  It has been rather a wet windy day not very cold.  Passed quite a lot of ships &amp; steamers.
