My dear Father,Your letter of 11th June to hand yesterday, for which I thank you very much.  Walter dropped in to see me for about 10 minutes this afternoon, & I thought he was looking very well.  We are all on the move again tomorrow so that I suppose it will be some time before I see him again.Very hot here this week even for summer, but the nights are always cool, & often cold.Harvesting operations are in full swing here now, & it is an eye-opener to see the way the women work.  They have the Massey-Harris
