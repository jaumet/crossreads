<p>you a better indication as to how things are going. &nbsp;I&#39;m pleased indeed to know everything is panning out so well.</p>
<p>Did the Nurse take a photo of wee Peggy? &nbsp;You didn&#39;t mention her in your last.</p>
<p>I think I have had all the money you sent over. &nbsp;I&#39;ve a nice wee balance over here at present, and will come in handy if any more leave comes along.</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got all the cards. &nbsp;Did you get the registered packet I sent just as I was going on leave,. &nbsp;Here&#39;s a few more, and I&#39;m hoping to get a lot more of the latest sets.</p>
<p>I hope you are in the best of nick and kept going at 87.</p>
<p>Sincere wishes for a Happy &amp; Prosperous&nbsp;New Year.</p>
<p>Your loving Cousin</p>
<p>John.</p>
