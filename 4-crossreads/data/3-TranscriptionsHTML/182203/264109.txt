My our change is for the better. We are under the British but they know how to look after their Sisters. We are very happy too &ndash; Aust. Officers    &amp; Orderlies &ndash; just an Imperial Matron over us but she seems a most charming woman    &amp; good manager.<br/>We are Billetted in a Convent &amp; it is very clean &amp; comfortable &ndash; Have about 20 mins walk to our work but very often a car calls for us. We all feed      <br/>P.S. Give all my friends my love &amp;  Xmas wishes. Tell them sorry I cannot write. No time    &amp; have been moving about so much. Tell Jess &amp; Mollie &ndash; Major O'Brien is here. Must stop &amp; go on duty  A convoy coming in.   Edith</p>
