It is a good dug-out, one of Fritz's with about 12 steps down to it. There are 27 in the party and we were very crowded. We work in 6 hours shifts, and as each party changes over, they change places with the crowd on duty and go to the down stairs portion of the dug-out. We have a party of Infantry attached to us as bearers and seven of them are with our party, Stan Wright went Home sick after carrying in one patient, so we had a big Inf. Chap in his place. The first patient we took over the top, but it was very bad going, so we took the rest of ?em through the sap. In places it is up to the knees in water, and also is partly filled in with earth, but for all that it is much better than falling into shell holes. We were kept busy on our shift. At 12 mid-nt we changed over and went into the lower room, where we had a feed of B.B.B. and Cheese then we kuddled together and tried to sleep, but it was a dismal failaure. We had no candles, so on our way back from the next post, we called in at some A.H.Q and asked if they would oblige us with a few.
