  
 there are Bedouins who are more anxious to fight then the Turks are; This morning Sig Law & I had to attend a board of enquiry & give evidence concerning Sig Richardson & Tpr Roberts who have been missing since August 4th;  We expected to go out on a stunt tonight but it has been postponed till tomorrow night. Went over to Bde Head Qrs this evening to see about a 'phone to take out with us. It is asserted there are 3,000 Turks at Bir-El-Mazar which is 25 miles West of El Arish & 20 miles East pf Bir-El-Salmana   The Camel Corps are to attack the Turks who are entrenched & we are in reserves & only go 9 miles East of Salmana; I hardly think this attack will be successful
