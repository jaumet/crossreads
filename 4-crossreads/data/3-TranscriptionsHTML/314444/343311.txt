<p>Dear old Mater,</p>
<p>A line or two more to say that all's well.  Since last writing we have been on the move again &amp; are now camped right on the sea coast near El Arish.  It is good to be near the water again, &amp; a swim as soon as we got here went very well as we had the dust &amp; grime of a 2 days' ride on us.  Don't think we will be here very long &amp; expect that we will keep pushing on now.</p>
<p>We are at last getting into different country it is getting harder &amp; we notice a little vegetation here &amp; there in the shape of shrubs &amp; a few fig &amp; castor oil trees.  It is nearly 12 months since we rode across the canal &amp; made a start to get across the desert.  Fancy nearly a year to advance a little over 100 miles.  It will give you some idea of the difficulties that were in the way.</p>
<p>Altho' the actual distance is not</p>
