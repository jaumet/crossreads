<p>Dear Dad, Mother, George &amp; Ellis,</p>
<p>It is Easter Sunday but we had no duck &amp; apple sauce.  I was at Tidworth Jail all the morning with a Prisoner.  I take on any job to get away from the Camp.  I shall go for a walk as soon as I have completed this letter.  I was made a W.O. on the 10/4/19  but I gave my name in to go Home this morning, so I shall not wear it very long.  I may not get away for some months, but I am "going my hardest" as they say.  I saw Billy Allison yesterday &amp; He is going to the boat-depot soon.  Sometimes chaps are only in the depot a fortnight &amp; other times they are there for 3 months.  We have had some hot weather. 73&percnt; Fahr. in fact, &amp; it is a rather sudden change from dead winter.  I went for a long walk with two of the Boys on Good Friday.  We happened upon two small villages in our ramble.  We had Tea in the garden, a lovely old-world Garden served by the Old Grandma who keeps the P.O.</p>
