<p>2nd October 1915.  Awakened at 6 am as usual &amp; the rough weather expected has arrived. The boat is rolling &amp;  pitching a little  &amp;  I have a feeling that before many hours have passed I'll be very seasick.  Have a good wash &amp;  brush up in anticipation, but not willing to risk going to breakfast. Manage to get my kit &amp;  blankets stowed away  &amp;  after mainly trying to fight the sickness off until well into the afternoon, eventually give in  &amp; "heave &ndash; o", then lay down on deck, occasionally getting up for a walk.</p>
<p>Feel so terribly ill at night that have to get a friend to bring a hammock    &amp;  blankets up, which I sling in the bathroom of hospital &amp;  do not care if the ship goes down. Might mention that I am not the only one in this predicament.</p>
