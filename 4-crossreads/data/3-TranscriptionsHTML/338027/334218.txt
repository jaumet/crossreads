<p>Saturday, 31 July, 1915<br/>Received bad news that two more of our chaps are dead Tommy Price &amp; Rosey, two of the strongest men in the corp, fever &amp; pneumonia being the cause I wrote home but was annoyed as only the Sydney Mail arrived for us and I had no letters to reply to as they were not sorted by the time we sailed at six o'clock closely followed by the other newly painted hospital ship Seang Choon.</p>
<p>Sunday, 1 August, 1915<br/>On fatigues all morning scrubbing floors and cleaning up &amp; other house maid duties of the 1. L.H.F.A.  The Seang Choon has been following us closely all day, one of our chaps has made a book on the result of who will reach first at night the former passed us and I have backed the Clan.</p>
<p>There was an angry scrap at Achi Baba a few days ago and the Turks lost heavily.</p>
