<p>Friday 22 August 1919<br/>Went in alongside No 2 wharf at brekker time. Kept waiting till about 11 am before we were allowed ashore. Got a car from the wharf to the P.O. &amp; posted our letters. Bought some post cards &amp; some camera stuff &amp; then had tea. Wrote the post cards there. Went into a jewellers &amp; had a look around &amp; then round to the Grand Hotel for lunch. Couldn't get any there till late so wandered out &amp; went to some cafe. Very poor.  After lunch spoke to a person &amp; he told us to get a car &amp; go to Hout Bay for a spin. We did &amp; it was goodo. Very pretty all the way. Table Mtn. was enveloped in clouds all day. Visited Rhodes house &amp; gee it is bonny. His taste was good. Had dinner at the Mount Nelson hotel &amp; came back about 9.45 pm. The Main was berthed next to us.</p>
<p>Saturday 23 August 1919<br/>The Main is a family boat &amp; gee it is some rough. Do hope dear old Nettie doesn't strike one of these things. Quite a lot of birds came onboard today drunk to the world. We left at 11 am &amp; pulled out &amp; awaited our 8 prisoners. They came on about 11.30 &amp; then we steamed out. Our mails left today by the Edinburgh Castle. Took a few snaps. The old boat is rolling some. There is a big land swell. Ate oranges from the Comforts Fund &amp; read some aussie papers after dinner. Had the tables all boarded up at dinner tonight to keep the plates quiet. Saw Sister Gallin &amp; Lt. Anderson on board the Main. Our guards gave a bit of trouble. We are 10 men short.</p>
