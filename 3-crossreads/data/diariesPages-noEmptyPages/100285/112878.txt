the morning, it will be alright so long as he can catch the 12.27 from Paddington that will land him at Westbury by 2.30. its only a little way from there to Warminster, we are going to make arrangements in the morning for Chunder to answer his name at 3 oclock when the draft falls in, if Len is not there, we can fix it up with the R.T.O. at Warminster, so if Len can reach Warminster by 5 or 6 oclock he will be right, its going to be a tight race I hope he gets here in time otherwise there will be trouble, for as it is Len is AW.L. this sort of thing happens pretty regular for the Sgts work things among themselves for extensions of leave etc, its pretty easy once you get into the know but this time she will be a close shave
