 August , 1938 , The Highland , Page Seven " O Valiant Heart " This beauti hymn was sung at the unveil , by His Majesti King Georg VI. on 22nd Juli , 1938 , of the Australian War Memori at Viller Brettoneux , which perpetu the memori of the Australian Imperial Forc in Franc and of 11,000 of them who fell in Franc and who have no known grave . O valiant heart , who to your glori came Through dust of conflict and through battl flame ; Tranquil you lie , your knight virtu prove , Your memori hallow in the land you love . Proud you gather , rank on rank , to war , As who had hear God 's messag from afar ; All you had hope for , all you had , you gave To save mankind ? yourself you scorn to save . Splendid you pass , the great surrend made , Into the light that never more shall fade ; Deep your content in that blest abod , Who wait the last clear trumpet call of God . Long year ago , as earth lay dark and still , Rose a loud cri upon a lone hill , While in the frailti of our human clay , Christ , our Redeem , pass the self-sam way . Still stand His Cross from that dread hour to this , Like some bright star abov the dark abyss ; Still , through the veil , the Victor 's piti eye Look down to bless our lesser Calvari . These were His servant ; in His step they trod , Follow through death the martyr Son of God . Victor , He rose ; victori , too , shall rise They who have drunk His cup of sacrific . O Risen Lord , O Shepherd of our Dead , Whose Cross has brought them and whose staff has led , In glorious hope their proud and sorrow land Commit her children to Thi gracious hand . In these difficult time , when the world is in a state of rapid transform and the old order give way to the new , there is increas need for "valiant heart " to be prepar for that which Fate hold in store . Hope for the futur spring from the exampl of the past and we must preserv unsulli , the tradit of those "valiant heart " symbolis in the Memori at Viller Brettoneux .
