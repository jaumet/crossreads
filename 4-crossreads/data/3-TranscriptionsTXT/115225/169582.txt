June 26th  Gisele & her Mother stayed at La Chaussee to-day to ship their furniture from Picquigny to their future home for the duration of the war, at a place near Beauvais (Aise) they are going there to-morrow for good - they asked me to call & see them in the evening ^and Prend une tasse de cafe - we did our trip to Frechencourt & back & I took Gisele a bunch of roses & also Zita & in the evening I called round to say good-bye to Gisele, & they asked me if I could take them to the Saleux on the following morning, as they would catch a train there for Beauvais. I had been warned to stay in the park for an inspection so I told them that I would get another lorry to stop for them
