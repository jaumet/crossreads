<p>The anguish of the suffering and the weakness of the strong<br/>And the thousand things that make the soldier's name.</p>
<p>You cannot know the bravery that leads the soldier forth<br/>Defying shells and guns that sweep the space<br/>And mow as with Time's sickle from the pride of Nature's youth<br/>As toward the foe he boldly turns his face</p>
<p>And the tiny little dug-outs where the weary men are crammed<br/>For the moment just to stay Exhaustion's grip<br/>And the shells discordant screeching drown the rifle's noisy din<br/>The ghastly roar, then moans from someone's lips</p>
