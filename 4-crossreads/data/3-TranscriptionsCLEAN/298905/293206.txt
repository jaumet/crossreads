very much like the rest of England the scenery in Wales is very good it is more mountainous than EnglandOn arrival at Llandudno, I went to Routledges place at once, & found he had just gone to Australia, wasn't I stiff after coming so far, so I decided straight away to get back as soon as possible on enquires I found that a train was leaving for London at 9.15. so I went back by it, so I did not get much of a look at Llandudno.Reached London on the return journey at 5 oclock & took a taxi down to Peel House & here I am after my mad journey as hungry as a hawk. This afternoon a party of 20 men including myself went to a garden party at Sir Ian Hamiltons house
