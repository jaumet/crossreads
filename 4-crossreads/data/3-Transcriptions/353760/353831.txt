<p>January 27<br/>back, looking at Vin's A.I.F. Book, Radis in sweeping out discussed Jock's peace with us, needless to say David bit, and he defended the dying rumours of our moving to Egypt.  I said, "Well as a matter of fact, I suppose England's got the wind up, and doesn't fancy the idea of the A.I.F. declaring against her."  David lept into lurid flames but Radis saved the situation, "Why if the Germans offered me a couple of bob more a day, I'd join them!"</p>
<p>David dropped the A.I.F. Book and stormed out.</p>
<p>125.<br/>At the Dabs Y.M. last night, amongst the new items, "The Green Eye of the Little Yellow God".  All the tragedy and bathos of the world in it, and in a long silence between two eloquent phrases &ndash; in the audience a whimper &ndash; "Oh, don't put the wind up us digger!"  When some R.M.O. came in just before the show's starting a hoarse voice [indecipherable] &ndash; "Have you found my voice yet Don?" &ndash; and a louder voice judged &ndash; "Medicine and Duty!"</p>

But so many times have these most desirable of rumours been accepted by us that a time of eternal doubting has come to pass, so that if we do move for the East, it will come to us as a wounderful surprise.</p>
<p>127.<br/>Today a day of wet day's mist.  Yesterday &ndash; mists then &ndash; some of the 4th Div. went over on the front, and by surprise captured 40 Bosch, and discovered almost in the front line preparations for heavy gun emplacements.</p>

<p>128.<br/>Tonight I've read the two last instalments of John Galsworthy's "The Apple Tree" in Nash's, a three part novel, and full of Spring charm and poetry.  One of the prettiest pieces of writing Nashs have printed.</p>
<p>No Mail.</p>
<p>In the paper the German Chancellor answering speech to Lloyd G. and Wilson, a surprise to the blatant optimists &ndash; what half of us had expected.  And possibilities of offensive by us next Spring?</p>
