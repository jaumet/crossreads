<p>a dozen bombs round about here, gave us all a bit of a scare. Last night one of our big siege guns was doing some business &amp; it just rocked everything, must have been a naval 15 inch.</p>
<p>9/11/16  Thursday</p>
<p>No rain &ndash; but raw sort of day &ndash; Assisting in the Operating Tent &ndash; very busy night &amp; day, here there are 8 Tables &amp; about a dozen Doctors, some awful wounds &amp; plenty of amputations, my hours are from 8 am to 8.30 pm &ndash; quite tied up.</p>
<p>10/11/16  Friday</p>
<p>Very nice day &amp; fine &ndash; On duty at Operating Tent. Not so many casualtys today, the 1st &amp; 2nd Divisions seem to be getting a rough time. German Aeroplanes dropping bombs freely during the night, very little damage done hereabouts &ndash; Our Guns bombarding very heavily during the night, which was a lovely clear moonlight. We got in a fellow with both legs blown off, he was leading a horse, when they walked on a dud &amp; it exploded &ndash; A Tommy while leading a horse to water, the horse fell thro a dug out &amp; inside there were two german spys.</p>
