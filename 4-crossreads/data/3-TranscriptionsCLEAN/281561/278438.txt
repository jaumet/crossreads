We may be releived tonight. 6/10/17 Was releived by the 10th Battalion last night, in furious rain and wind. The guides got lost. I lead the company out, or rather they followed me; for after we got floundering in the marches it was "sauve qui peut." Got out to our old position in Reserves, where I seized a "Bon" position in a concrete "pill Box", a vast improvement on the mud holes. There is plenty of tucker, and feel the better of a good sleep. I do believe the Hun deliberately tried to do for me in that last stunt. The walls of this "Pill Box" are four feet thick, and are strongly reinforced with steel rails and bars. This space inside is only about four feet high.
