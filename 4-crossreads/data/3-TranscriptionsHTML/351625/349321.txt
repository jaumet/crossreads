<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>It is just about up to me to write you another few lines, you will wonder at me writing in ink, I have lost my pencil so had to borrow a pen.  Thanks very much for the parcels you sent me.  I got the one with that nice cake in and another with socks, etc. in.  I have received 5 altogether from you &amp; others the last couple of weeks &amp; a number of mails &amp; bulletins.  I am writing this in my tent which consists of a bit of canvas square shape tied down</p>
