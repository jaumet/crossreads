<p>Thursday May 31st<br/>Was paid 10/- today. I had 14/8 in my pay book, but they apparently don't pay the odd money. 3d was also deducted, for hut damages. This is done every month to pay all damages caused to huts by unknown persons. Went for a walk through Weymouth this evening. It was lovely walking round the esplanade. There aren't so many people about, now as this last few days, of course the holidays are now over.</p>
<p>Friday June 1st<br/>Very cold day with strong wind blowing, put in a cold night last night. I forgot to say that yesterday we were put under isolation, owing to vermin being found by about half a dozen fellows, in there blankets, &amp; clothes. All our blankets &amp; mattresses were taken off us, &amp; late last night we received three blankets which were very thin, &amp; it was extra cold during the night, so we all had a very cold time of it. Put on digging this morning, I prefer it much better to physical training. Went for a walk to Weymouth, but did not stop long. Sent pcl to Mrs R.</p>
<p>Saturday June 2nd<br/>Had another freezer last night, still without our mattresses, but we will have them tonight for certain. Not feeling well today. Very quiet, did not go out of camp at all. Very interested in a book, so my mind was partially occupied. Feeling very much down in the dumps. I have lost 8 lbs since coming back from furlough, camp life cannot be agreeing with me.</p>
