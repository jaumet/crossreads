  
 point we didn't get  a  a very good opportunity of seeing what was on either the left or right hand side of the point. There is still another wireless station behind the buildings I have referred to and we could see a big French Battleship at anchor. The Naval & Coaling stations may be round here somewhere & possibly the buildings are connected with them. The Arabian Coast is very mountainous, otherwise the country is nothing but dry looking sandy desert. Towards 8 p.m. on the same day (Dec 2nd) we passed through the Straits of Babel-Mandeb
