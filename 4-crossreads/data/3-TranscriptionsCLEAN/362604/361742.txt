the record harvest for 50 years & whereas last year the Harvest was only equivalent to 12 weeks Bread, this year it is equal to 40 weeks.  That is a great amount of shipping saved.  Well, Mum, I've no further news.  We are all well & have plenty to occupy our time & keep us from going dopey.  If you see Dave you can mention that it is likely "Ernie" Grigor will be coming Home.  I'll write again later in the week.  It is just on Tea-time & I want to get done early to-night as I've 20 letters to write & a whole bundle of "socks" to darn.  Fond Love to you all.  Keep cheery.  We are always so.
Fond LoveHarry, xxx
