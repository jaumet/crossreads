<p>29 December 1918 Sunday<br/>Recd. Parcel of good things from Kathleen &amp; have written her.  I am detailed to write the History of the Regiment from inception-   I wish I had my Diary to refer to but it is no use sending it.  It would be too late-<br/>We as Officers are still all confined to Camp now as punishment for the outrage against the Bedouins of Surafend the discipline is atrocious nobody cares now the war is over for instance as I write 2 horses are at our "feed heap" &amp; the day stablemen take no notice.  I enclose a long letter from a priest who I used to argue much with over Seinn Fein etc etc   it reads like a sermon in parts trying it on the dog sort of thing.</p>
