  
 Easter Day 8 April 1917 
 Re sheep when I have time I'll write Minister of Agriculture re possibility of RAM Trade here with Australia. They are mongrel sheep but the country is good. I can see Turksshells bursting over our planes as I write. 
 Marching here we passed over the Rafa Battlefield & saw the graves of the men we lost there Jan. 9th. The Bedouins were gathering their Barley over the Battlefield, shells everywhere. 
 KHAN YUNUS is covered with prickly pears & scrubby Bushes, Old Ruins on every side, not too good to fight in, we got Hotchkiss guns issued today.
