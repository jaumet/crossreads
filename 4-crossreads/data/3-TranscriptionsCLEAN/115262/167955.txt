 In hospital. Feeling not too good, but expect to be out in a couple of days. 
 Another mail in. Got 4 letters. Wrote 2 this afternoon. 
 A very heavy fog hung to the ground till 7 am. when it lifted. 1st dampness of any description that we have seen in atmosphere since arriving in Egypt. 
 Feeling worse this afternoon if anything  running a temp.
