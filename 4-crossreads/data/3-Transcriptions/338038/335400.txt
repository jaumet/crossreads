<p>No 3 London Gen Hospital<br/>Wandsworth  5/10/17<br/>74  Gassed</p>
<p>My Dear Father &amp; Mother<br/>Have been as blind as a bat the last week from a dose of Mustard oil gas caught in the Hooge Battle of the 26th.  I asked Sis to cable you as no doubt it will be appearing in the casualties &ndash; I am doing famously now.  The gas is not quite clear of my lungs yet and eyes very weak &amp; sore but theres absolutely no</p>
