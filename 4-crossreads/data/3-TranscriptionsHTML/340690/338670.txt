Carter, Taylor &amp; Sarre expected back to-day and arrived with rations.  Read and wrote till time to go out at 11.45 with Stott, Hosking and Bailly.  Met other party coming home.  Shelling very heavy and others seemed very shaken.  Inglis, Griffith shrapnel wounds and Berry gassed.  Waited at dump until shelling stopped at about 1.15 and went up with party of 3 men &amp; Corporal.  Communication Trench badly broken in one place and parapet scattered all along.  Passed one prisoner &amp; numerous casualties.  However evening fairly quiet.  On to job and did some digging and repairing.  Trench badly broken in parts and a good few casualties on our jobs.  Another raid at 3.30 on right and officer told us to clear out so we came home at 3 and just got in after bombardment.  Went to bed in good time.</p>
<p>14.3.18<br/>Stayed in bed all day and have to go out at 6.  Some rain.  Raid last night a complete failure on Fritz's part.  Also 10th raid did not come off &amp; they lost 4 casualties.
