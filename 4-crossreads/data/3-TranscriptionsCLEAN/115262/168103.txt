Sunday 2 December 1917.
Shelled again today but only for 1/2 hr. [Rumored that our 60 pounders got 3 direct hits on one of Jacko's long range guns]  These big guns of the enemy are run on rails backwards & forwards thus making it impossible for artillery fire to be effective on them, So the report goes?
