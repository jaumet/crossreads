<p>4.  &amp; arrived pretty tired about 11 pm.  I was fortunate in finding a table in an old shed where I <strike>lay</strike> camped as best I could.  I reported to the R. T. O. (railway transfer Officer) at 7 am the following morning who told me the train would get away at 9.  His 9 turned out to be 12.15. &amp; then it took us till 7 that night to do 30 miles.  Here we were shoved into a Rest Camp, &amp; I managed to get some dry bed &amp; cheese for supper, the first feed I had had since morning.  I camped in <strike>to</strike> a sort of Office on the siding that night, &amp; was awakened at 2 A.M. by a sergeant who said the train was leaving almost at once.  You can imagine how disgusted I was when, after being pulled out at that hour, the train didn't leave till &frac14; past 1 (PM)  Then we came on &amp; got here at &frac12; past 9 last night.  There was a boat across to England at midnight but they said they couldn't take us. (About 250 Tommies &amp; 10 or 15 Australians are waiting to go across)  So they shoved us into another Rest Camp here, &amp; the latest is we have to report at 8.30 tonight, boat leaves at 10 PM.  Of course it is pretty sure that</p>
