FEB.   WEDNESDAY 16   1916
Fine. On the guns in the morning  At 12 oclock parade they called for volunteers to picket the Central Station & I stepped out amongst 102 others from 15/1. We were given a hot meal at 4 oclock and left in special trams about 6.15. We were  served out with service rifles and 20 rounds ball ammunition per man. We went to the Victoria Barracks & the other units were served out with rifles & ammunition  We went back to the Central in trams & picketed every entrance till 1 AM & then had a special train back to Tempe. Nobody man, woman or child was allowed on the station without a ticket. The crowd was very quiet as a whole & beyond using the butt of the rifle half a dozen times, nothing happened at all exciting
