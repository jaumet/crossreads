 at present there are arriving here every Day troops from gallipoli and I think that they must be leaving there for good and a good job too because they will never do any good there now. Gallipoli Should have been won in may and So it would have been if England had have Sent Enough men. But no England puts a handful of men on there and Expects them to Do the job. Wich is asking too much indeed  England has a lot to learn [indecipherable] in that line 
 finished.
