are all marching out & are being issued with ammunition as fast as possible.I never in all my life saw any men so keen for a fight as they are.  We don't know whether it has been quelled yet, but the various units are still marching out.  All of them singing & laughing like fury.It will be God help the Natives when they reach Cairo.  There was a fight outside the Sultans Palace, but we have no further news.  Some of our Men & Sergeants are out & I don't know how they are faring.
Our Postal messenger was chased for a mile, but he got away from them.  We have not received any further orders, but our chaps are very keen & want to volunteer to go, but they will not take them yet.I have been expecting this all along & now that it has come, I am sure if it assumes large proportions our fellows will wipe the Arabic population out of existence.  It is very hard to distinguish the Arabs from the poor class of Egyptian, so I suppose they will suffer also, but they are very nearly as bad.laterThe riot has ended
