<p>16th Dec 16</p>
<p>My dear Harry</p>
<p>Thank you so much old boy for your splendid letter of 21st October &amp; all the news it contains. Your letters are so carefully written &amp; are like a book, they are most interesting &amp; I can tell you are keenly welcomed, not only by myself but by Basin &amp; Jack Travers to whom I pass them.</p>
<p>I have recently had two trips to London, one in October for 13 days &amp; a second at end of November for 6 days &amp; both most enjoyable. I stayed at Morley's Hotel, Trafalgar Square, which I made my head quarters &amp; I radiated from there in all directions 50 miles. I had a motor car at my disposal all the time. It was a "Sunbeam" car presented by Mr Winchcombe of Sydney to the A.I.F. Headquarters, so if you happen to know Mt Winchcombe just let him know what pleasure &amp; profit I gained from his gift after 2&frac12; years of War without a holiday. Of course I saw the usual sights of London, dined at all the hotels, The Carlton, Savoy, Princes, St Ermins, Windsor &amp; others, at the Automobile Club, the Army &amp; Navy, St Stephens, the Caledonia &amp; went to all the theatres, - of course as knowing me so well, you may imagine I did not go alone, but of this more anon when I see you. &ndash; But London, though marvellous, is not England. But I need not tell you, as you know England better than I do. But I was charmed with the runs into the country &ndash; the Thames Valley, Eton, Windsor, Richmond, Maidenhead, Cookham (Ah! thats the place now for a honeymoon if you like so I must remember it), Guilford, Bookham (where Mr Cecil Darley lives &amp; by way he asked kindly after you) Birkenhead, the Chiltern Hills in Hartfordshire. I must cry a halt or you will think this a geography lesson. Anyway I have lost my heart to dear old England, the loveliest country I have seen or wish to see, &amp; I now forgive anyone who wants to live there. I met my wife's relations, splendid people who live on the Hampton Court line.</p>
