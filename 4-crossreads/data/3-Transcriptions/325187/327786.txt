<p>We asked some of the <strike>Welch</strike> Welsh Officers to Mess last night as a rule we get on<u> well with</u> the Regular Officers<br/> [Following paragraph is<br/> crossed out]<br/>but the very fresh Kitcheners Army Officers are a supercilious lot &amp; look upon us as "Beastly Colonials", of course our men do SKITE a bit &amp; our Officers are not all one could always wish but alongside the Tommy counter jumper we can hold our own.  They never speak to us in Tram or Train &amp; I suppose when the war is over would not recognise us at all<br/>Why do so many of our young men go to England to join Regiments aren't the Australian forces good enough I wonder?</p>
