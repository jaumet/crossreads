<p>Sept 4th 1915</p>
<p>Sat 4th<br/>Stan &amp; Les on duty on the 'phone from 4 till 8 'clock this morning here at No 1 Outpost; I woke at 5 o'clock had a nice little walk down to the well for water, which is nearly a mile away from here; (we always seem unlucky in never striking camp near water); Last night a fatigue party of 200 men were told off. Some of them had to put out barb wire entanglements &amp; the remainder to be ready in case of discovery &amp; attack; A Monitor opened fire from opposite us at dinner time with large guns apparently shooting at a target some-where in the Narrows; At 4 oclock a Cruiser gave The Turks trenches on Walkers Ridge a particularly rough time dropping large shells right along their trenches, There is only a gully between us &amp; where the shells fell. So we had a grand view of the bombardment.</p>
