  
 Friday 16th Aug. 
 This morning we left Villers Brettoneux & marched near Corbie by Chatelet to the village of Vaire. Here we were joined by the bearers, (who had arrived before us,) in a camp surrounded by trees on the bank of the Somme. Although this was just behind our old front line, it is a tremendous contrast to Villers Brettoneux. The former place encompassed us in a scene of desolation & an atmosphere of abominable stinks; here, outside the village & in a perfect woodland retreat we have nature again near us. It is temporary wonderland; only temporary for we are going up the line again tomorrow, I believe. 
 There are certainly dug outs in the woods, & along the river, & here & there
