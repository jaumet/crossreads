<p>Tuesday 1st October<br/>Walked horses about &ndash; fed &amp; watered.</p>
<p>After dinner ordered out with full gear. Packed up &amp; with Mr Fountain moved out to 10th Bde again. Still pretty rough, took shelter behind a tank. After waiting about 1 hour, further work found impracticible. Returned home none too sorry.</p>
