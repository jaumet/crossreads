<p>The work I am engaged on at present, that of Artillery Observation is very interesting, tho' at the same time very complicated.  As a pilot of a 2-seater reconnaisance machine, there is more head work required in the Aerial Navigation part of it, but I am getting on well with it, &amp; find I can grasp it by sticking at it.<br/>I have now completed &amp; passed all tests in the following:- Bombs, &amp; bombing, machine guns (Vickers &amp; Lewis) Photography, Wireless A &amp; B (Sending &amp; receiving at 8 words per minute) &amp; Aerial Nav.  I am hoping to have my commission in 6 weeks time from now   Under the old system (that of getting your commission on graduating "A" category) I would have had my commission this week, &amp; then got my "wings" in about 6 weeks later (i.e. Category "B")  An order (Royal Air Force) came out recently that "from the 13th of August 1918, a pilot must graduate in both Category "A" &amp; "B"  before he can get his Commission."  As this only came into force on the 13th of last month, I only missed by about a month.  Now</p>
