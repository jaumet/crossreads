<p>1/8/19 Cape Town<br/>First thing about 20 men broke ship and went ashore on a lighter. Niggers arrived alongside to coal the ship but were stopped and intimidated by some of our malcontents. I could have got the job done as I addressed all the troops at both ends of the ship and soundly rated the gaol bird element. However an order came off shore for coaling to cease and then another ordering us to come in alongside. A pilot came out and took us in at 11 am and we berthed opposite a British cruiser and near the Prinz Ludwig. The Cap Polonia 22 000 tons was also in. the Staff Officer came aboard and we discovered that the Port doctor yesterday signed our clearances on the ship yet went off and told shore authorities</p>
