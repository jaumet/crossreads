  
 Saturday 16 June 1917 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.]  Lost a horse last night & found him in Camel Officers lines - one of our men had been promised a carton of whisky for a Horse. To such a state have morals sunk but Officers!! should not encourage such jobbery. Horses are much prized by Camel Officers - handier than Camels. 
 On the range again today getting men accustomed to the new High Velocity Rifles - & ammunition. Dust continuous & the Beach seems afar off.
