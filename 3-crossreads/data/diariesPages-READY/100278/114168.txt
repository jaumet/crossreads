remarks, they only look for the faults and point them out to you.
An "order" came out last night that all men doing 2nd field punishment have to report "battle order" to the Corporal of the guard at 6.45 every morning and again at 4.30 5.30 and 6.30 so that will keep them busy and out of the estaminets. When we marched in we fell out and put our rifles and equipments away, and "fell in" again with our box helmets for they were to be dipped in "Condy's" the mouth pieces only, for you know when you are wearing these helmets there is a lot of saliva runs down in to the tube that brings the air from the filtering tank and this sort of thing as you know breeds disease, so every now and again the rubber mouth pieces are dipped for safety's sake
