  
 We saw one sailor man biff his officer in the launch  -  The officer went wallop  -  It was a good humoured, drunken spree but I don't wonder at the Admiral not granting leave vy often  -  There'll be some trouble tomorrow I expect  -  How some of the chaps wd ever get up the gangway I don't know  -  There was a dark rumor that one officer even was paralytic & they passed him inboard thro a port hole  -  Well we watched all this & enjoyed it muchly  -  Leave was up at 6 pm for one & all of us  -  Darken ship was the signal but that didn't stop 4 of us playing bridge till bedtime  -
