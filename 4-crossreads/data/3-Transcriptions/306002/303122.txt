<p>26.4.15<br/>Mon. 26th.  This morning half of us led the horses out for exercise, while the others cleaned up the lines.  No parade after dinner &amp; we had time enough to slip down &amp; have our farewell bath in Helouan.  Stables at 3.30, then tea, &amp; had to be ready to leave Helouan at 6 oclock.  It was just dark when we marched by the Tewfik Palace Hotel, &amp; were soon on the road to Maadi.  The night was cool &amp; the moon came out shortly after we started, but I was too sleepy to enjoy the ride, &amp; was glad when we arrived at Maadi at midnight &amp; were asleep within half an hour, &amp; rather hungry to be comfortable.</p>
