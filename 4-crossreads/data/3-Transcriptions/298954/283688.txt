<p>1918<br/>Sat. 9th Nov.<br/>Wilhelm abdicates.   News received here at 11 am.   Rumoured the Heinrich von Preussen assassinated.<br/>Revolution is expected hourly &ndash; we are ready to take to the forest  immediately, should the lager be looted for food.</p>
<p>At 9 pm. the church bells rang &amp; cheering was clearly audible in Brandenburg.   The guards remove their cap badges.</p>
<p>Sun 10th<br/>Red Flag was hoisted over the lager at 10 am, the Count being taken away.   Captn Bruce &amp; Majah Walker were appointed our deputies to meet representatives of the new government.   We tried all possible measures to get out (at 2 p &amp; 7.30 p) to visit the town, with no success.   The till now easily bribed guards would not let us out even with food as a bribe!</p>
<p>Mon. 11th.<br/>As the only means of seeing a German town in its present state of flux I attached myself to the wagon going to the post office (at 1 pm).   The streets were crammed, all pushing toward the Hauptstrasse.  It was incredible to see the Kurassier Barrack flying a Red Flag, &amp; the Artillerie Kaserne proudly flew a red army blanket at their lofty pole!   Red army blankets are in common use as flags.</p>
