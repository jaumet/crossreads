 Always the way and always will be the way. As soon as we get nicely fixed up in a Camp we suddenly get a sudden move, we must be prepared for such things. I had gone to town and fortunately found a good dentist &ndash; a rare thing in such a purely Oriental town and paid him 100 piastres deposit to get on with that tooth of mine. (I have already paid &pound;10.5.2.) (10 Egyptian pounds).The dentist cleaned it out and I was to go to him tomorrow and after a couple of days the job would be completed and my happiness complete. But  now ! 
 10.pm. The troop and 7 of my signallers who were away in western Egypt came back I am very glad of that because they will be all together.

 Great preparations for a hurried departure Baggage being loaded by the ton Some of the men are to stay &amp; guard the Standing Camp while the regiment goes out. A Squadron goes North B Squadron goes South and the remainder goes East. Aeroplanes making daily air reconnaissances dont know what reports they are bringing in but we are moving, probably, in consequence of some information they have obtained. Head Quarters leave EL Minia at about 12 noon.
