  
 short time, although we went to see him  twice  three times.  We are  have  still been having some warm weather here but I don't suppose it will be long before we get it properly cold.  For the last couple of weeks we have been learning the Lewis machine gun & I think we will go on the range with it tomorrow, it is a great little gun & fires 15 shorts per second, it is the chief machine gun used & is worked by the ordinary infantry, there being 4 to every company, the best of them is they are so simple.  Have you decided yet as too buying Ingledene as you all seem so pleased with it, I suppose you have.  It must have been a great gale you had to blow down the wattle trees just as well it did nothing worse.  I hope you have good luck with the fowls, tell Colin
