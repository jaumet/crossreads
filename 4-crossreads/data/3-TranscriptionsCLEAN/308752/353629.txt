  
 more fortunate, though less honoured, perhaps than they. They also will have consolation in the knowledge that they have not given their all in vain & that the smiles of their loved ones will soon look down upon the Nations of the World at Peace. Those chaps of the Unit, who were on Leave in Paris of the United Kingdom, when the Armistice was signed, were certainly very fortunate, as judging by the papers, great celebrations were held there. All through the week we made merry at the Chateau, the thought of no more Line work & no more horrors of the Battlefield put us all in good spirits.  The following Sunday 16th November the Brigade held a Thanksgiving Service,  it was an impressive one. General Hobbs, the G.O.C. the Division, gave an address & stated that very shortly we would probably be moving to Germany, that Censorship Rules, would not near be so strict, all names of places could be mentioned, & that cameras could be carried. Everyone was satisfied with the latter, but the move towards Germany is unpopular. Get us all home to Australia, as soon as possible, is the main item. Amidst all the merry making & celebrating of our great victory, we must not forget, to Thank Almighty God, for the overwhelming defeat of our enemies.  As a move is shortly about to take place, this will compete the 13th Edition of the Diary. I sincerely hope that the next Edition, will tell of my usual good health, of my third leave to Blighty, & of my long looked for return.
