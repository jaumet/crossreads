<p>[Typed letter with postage date stamp 26 January 1918]<br/>Dear Ruth<br/>We see lots of people like these and all sorts of funny things I saw two little girls leading a cow and a calf through the streets and when someone wants to buy some milk on girl mils the cow sells the milk and then moves on again. I will be glad when I can tell you all about everything. Goodbye little girl, lots of love from<br/>Dad.</p>
