<p>On Active Service.<br/>At sea.<br/>Nov. 30th 1916</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Burston<br/><strike>The</strike> Life on the transport is every bit as good as it was when I left Sydney in April 1906 on my <strike>trip</strike> "Round the World on a Pencil" stunt. The lightening Caricature Bizz was never more flourishing.</p>
<p><strike>It is</strike>  About twelve years ago <strike>since</strike> I first "went astray" hitting off bob portrait sketches at a bar-maids' picnic on one of the Hobson Bay Boats. Since then I've followed the sun round the map working summer seasons on the Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane pleasure boats. The Isle of Man boats, Cafes in France, the Hudson Day line and Coney Island steamers, Palm Beach, Panama, Mexico, 'Frisco, Los Angeles, the Canadian Pacific triangle run between Victoria Vancouver and Seattle. Across the Rockies and Canada with Stewart Whytes' London pierrots and back home</p>
