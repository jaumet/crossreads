night sleep. As we were having Breakfast 8 more Ammunition Teams came in took up a position in front of our Mess Tables. As soon as the lads unharnessed their Teams, all our Boys offered them Biscuits Cheese Tea which they were very thankful as they had been on the road all night were tired hungry in fact just about knocked. After they finished had fed their horses they had their Breakfast down they laid everywhere some under their Wagons others in the open, there were a drizzly Rain fallen it made no difference to them they slept through it all until Dinner Time. They took things easy during the afternoon evening. The Bombardment was very quiet all Day Evening. It was freely rumored that the Big Push would start at 4 am next Morning. I invited two N.C.G's to camp in my Tent for the Night which they accepted I learnt from them that they had orders to move off at 5 am next Morning up to their Guns to move the guns
