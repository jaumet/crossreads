<p>30<br/>22/7/16<br/>To-night after tea a couple of other chaps &amp; myself went looking for a bath. We found a beautiful clear stream &amp; followed it up until we came to a bosker pool &amp; in we went. Cold, gee it was cold but it made us feel fresh afterwards.</p>
<p>When I got back the Corporal from the Post Office &amp; I went for a spin into the country on bikes by jove it was lovely. I saw the first rabbit since landing in France, that is wild the people keep them in boxes. We went right up a gorgeous valley &amp; could hear distinctly the sound of the guns. Had a cup of coffee at a dear little girls place near by here on the banks of the stream.</p>
<p>25/7/16<br/>Went for a glorious <strike>ride</strike> walk</p>
