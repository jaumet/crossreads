 HMAS Fantome Wednesday Dec 23 - 14 -  A naval brigade man died & we sent a detachment to the funeral under  Mr Bompas  at 8.30 - "The assembled ships company on this mournful occasion - will - at the cemetery - churchyard - stowaway or whatnot - assume an air - at once cheerful & subdued - cheerful - because our comrade has gone to a better land - subdued - because he forgot to pay his mess bill before he went" - Corporal Nunn came inboard yesty. He looked very well & we had a nice yarn - He expects to go back to Sydney & I hope he will take my journal with him - After some iced beer has been drunk we reviewed service matters -  Presently I was called away to join up a seining party made up of a whaler, skiff & tow boat - 25 men & 4 officers including the commander - We went to Matupu - an island about 3 miles down the harbor. It came on a tropic downpour but as the rig of the day was - bathing costume - it didn't matter - We had a good time, swimming, pulling in the seine but as a fishing party it was a dead dead failure - However it was a great outing both for men & officers - We got back by 7.15 & had grand appetites
