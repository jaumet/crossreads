<p>be no more.</p>
<p>To night we advanced our trenches to the other side of the "Pozeries" wood    Some of our chaps got some bonzer trophies, Zeiss glasses watches, rings, compassis, revolvers &amp; etc &amp; helmets by the thousand.</p>
<p>This afternoon we got 15 German Red Cross prisoners, they were marched down &amp; searched &amp; 13 of the dogs were found to be carrying daggers &amp; revolvers they promptly put against the wall &amp; finished.</p>
