Ramley with its tall spire & tower of the forty martyrs looks beautifulMust visit Ramley at first opportunity. Rechon is a quiet country village. Its principal products seem to be the wine industry, nuts & oranges.Some of the Orange groves are irrigated to perfection. One being camped here could easily forget that there was any War. The occasional visits of the Taubes however keep us
