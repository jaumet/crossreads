 My dearest Father, Since I last wrote, I have received a big budget of Australian letters, and among them were your very welcome letters of the following dates 15th April (2 letters) &amp; 28th April.  About the same time I also received your very acceptable birthday present.  Both the book &amp; the torch were very much appreciated, &amp; I thank you all very much for them. I have been kept at it lately, &amp; am very glad when Sunday comes round to have a spell.  I am writing this from an address of some friends who have been exceedingly kind to me lately.  I ran across them in quite an accidental way &amp; they have given me an open invitation to drop in at any time when I feel so inclined They have a lovely home out at Dulwich, about 30 minutes run in the car (they don't call the electric service over here "trams", but "cars") from Victoria Station Often when I get absolutely sick &amp; tired of my own company &amp; don't know what to do, I drop out to Dulwich &amp; pass the evening with music, dominoes, reading &amp; of course with the beloved pipe,- the soother of all troubles &amp; worries. I got sick of everything about a fortnight or so ago and in a desperate minute I put a transfer in for the Aust. Flying Corps.  I was very dubious about it
