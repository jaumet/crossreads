<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; TUESDAY 23&nbsp;&nbsp; MAY</p>
<p>Still blowing &amp; a bit cold, but there was some sun during the day. I was allowed up for a few hours &amp; was out on the deck in the sun. It was great to be out in the fresh air again, although I was very weak. There was a concert in the evening &amp; it was a fair success I believe.</p>

<p>The gulf dividing Saint and sinner is neither wide enough nor deep enough to make a song about.</p>
