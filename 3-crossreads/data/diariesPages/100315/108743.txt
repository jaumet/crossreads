2/4/18 ? Berthen
the other showed out clearly. Near Mont Rouge is a Corps H.Q. delightfully situated and having only come out of a filthy line last night we were well able to appreciate how much ease goes towards losing us the War. Ran down into Berthen a little place at the foot of Mont des Cats and there debussed. Walked out to billets a short distance out. Some of the officers were at a Corps Reinforcement Camp and myself had a stuffy little room in a dilapidated farmhouse. The folk all speak a Guttural Flemish fair English. A late mess dinner (9-10 p.m.) and so to bed very tired.
