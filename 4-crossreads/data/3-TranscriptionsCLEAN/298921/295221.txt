  
 September, 1915 Tuesday 7 Later very stiff last night from exercise, but no ill effects - [next sentence is encircled but not deleted] This morning had 2 eggs for breakFast, both bad - rotten - am told at this season Natives put eggs in their incubators (sand) those not fertile are sold  to the Hospitals!!!  as I told you the Fowls do not get " broody " in Egypt - incubators (home made) by natives have been used for years the eggs are like Pigeons & can not be seen in ordinary egg cup - 50% rotten. Went Cairo per car & got some Kit & Pay - I still have the little Housewife you made me ere I left Australia, also the one you made me before Africa is at home somewhere.
