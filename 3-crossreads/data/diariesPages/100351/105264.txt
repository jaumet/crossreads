a.m. we witnessed the fiercest bombardment etc. 400 yds. away that any of us had seen. This was kept up intermittedly until dawn. With the dawn & long before arrived the wounded. 4 a.m. shortage of Ammo & Bombs reported from firing trench. Charlie & self continued carrying same from Reserve & Gordon Dump until 10 a.m. all day On the 1st trip to firing line I experienced the raw recruits experience of seeing our dead everywhere. Coming back from line to Dump we were assisting the S.B. with a hvy wounded and was in front shafts when I heard a voice with something familiar about it say "They’re making it pretty willing aren’t they?" On enquiry from our S.B.
