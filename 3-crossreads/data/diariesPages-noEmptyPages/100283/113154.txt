not the slightest chance of winning . I'll bet they will get cut to pieces. The first news came through yesterday from that it appears they had broken through at Bullecourt Lagnicourt 1 or 2 more places but that signifies nothing for there is never any trouble for either side to make the first advance for they have all their guns registered on the trenches the front line is always lightly held, wait till they get up against the line of resistance have to haul their guns over shell torn ground get them into position for the next push then the fun starts, we know all about that from personal experience as for man to man goes every Australian knows who is the superior fighter, that has been tested too often the Fritzies know it in their own hearts too well
