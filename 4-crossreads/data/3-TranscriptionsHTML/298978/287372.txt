<p>I do?  "Explain to him exactly our condition.<br/>" Back I go across this lead-swept plateau with my message &ndash; altogether I had to go six times across this place.  When I reached Margy, he said "tell Harwood to bring the lads back, they are not wanted there and there isn't room for them; I don't want to lose my boys for nothing" &ndash; so back I had to go again.<br/>This time could not find Haywood, so then I had to find where our boys were on my own and pass the word for the 16th Battalion only to retire.</p>
<p>One rather amusing incident &ndash; while trying to get into the trench it didn't seem possible to do so without jumping on somebody's head; one of the chaps exclaimed to me " Come off the sky line, you  ---  fool " &ndash; "I will," I replied, "as soon as I can find space" "Jump in anywhere," he answered back, "never mind if you do hit anybody, your'e not in a drawing-room."<br/>It certainly did seem ridiculous, standing on ceremony in a time like this, though I don't suppose anything will alter this peculiar side of my nature.<br/>They are now digging a connecting trench between our new front and our old trenches &ndash; we have had to retire, the Turks are too strong for us.</p>
