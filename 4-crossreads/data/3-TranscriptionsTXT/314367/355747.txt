 PS.  You ask about Fitz's rank &ndash; He is a senior lieutenant &ndash; plain Mr on shore &ndash; at sea  by courtesy  - Commander or Captain or C. Officer &ndash; He's an egoist &ndash; I like him &amp; we get on well together &ndash; as a navigator he knows his job &amp; all of us have great faith in him &ndash; In an emergency I think he'd be cool &amp; collected &ndash; Its Friday 6th &ndash; We shall be back in Rabaul by 10 am &ndash; Its 6 am now &ndash; Weather very fine but hot &ndash; We've to coal &ndash; It may be the end of Feb before we get to Sydney so don't worry &ndash;
