4.6.15Fri. 4th.  This morning our warboats opened fire to the South of us & have kept up the heaviest cannonading all day that I have ever heard, there are several rumors afloat, the most popular being that the Turks are making a charge on the English & French troops, but they must be getting a lively time at all events.  A naval officer made a wager with Cobcroft (A Sq.) laying 125 to 5 to say there will be no fighting in Turkey after Sunday next.  I hope it is right & that we are sent across to France straight away to see the finish there.  A Sq. Signallers relieved us at dinner time & we have put the evening in sunbathing.  Some rifle shots by snipers has been the full extent of the fighting here to-day.
