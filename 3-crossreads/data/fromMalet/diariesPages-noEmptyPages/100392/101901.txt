I am in a causilty clearing station here and may be moved away from here any day we had Xmas new year here and and had a little spread and a concert the matron sent me a red cross Xmas Box "australian" . I was the only one in this hospital. I missed all my parcels sent to the Battery and I am waiting for my letters to be forwarded on to me they are a long time coming the country now is all snowed up everything all white and cold
