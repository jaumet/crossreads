<p>HMAS Fantome<br/>Wednesday Dec 23 &ndash; 14 &ndash;  A naval brigade man died &amp; we sent a detachment to the funeral under <u>Mr Bompas</u> at 8.30 &ndash; "The assembled ships company on this mournful occasion &ndash; will &ndash; at the cemetery &ndash; churchyard &ndash; stowaway or whatnot &ndash; assume an air &ndash; at once cheerful &amp; subdued &ndash; cheerful &ndash; because our comrade has gone to a better land &ndash; subdued &ndash; because he forgot to pay his mess bill before he went" &ndash;<br/>Corporal Nunn came inboard yesty. He looked very well &amp; we had a nice yarn &ndash; He expects to go back to Sydney &amp; I hope he will take my journal with him &ndash; After some iced beer has been drunk we reviewed service matters &ndash;  Presently I was called away to join up a seining party made up of a whaler, skiff &amp; tow boat &ndash; 25 men &amp; 4 officers including the commander &ndash; We went to Matupu &ndash; an island about 3 miles down the harbor. It came on a tropic downpour but as the rig of the day was &ndash; bathing costume &ndash; it didn't matter &ndash; We had a good time, swimming, pulling in the seine but as a fishing party it was a dead dead failure &ndash; However it was a great outing both for men &amp; officers &ndash; We got back by 7.15 &amp; had grand appetites</p>
