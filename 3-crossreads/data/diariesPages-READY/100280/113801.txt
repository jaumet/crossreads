when I had known it last gone were the hustle bustle of thousands of men and hundreds of trams that used to crowd round the dump, the only thing moving was a little engine called "puffing Billy" belonging to the "Anzac light railway", while there not more than 2 or 3 men on the dump, all the buildings have been pulled down, tents taken away, dugouts everywhere empty, while even the road was deserted, the place looks very desolate
