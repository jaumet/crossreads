<p>very threatening but nothing came of it, we had a long &amp; tiresome march for you know we had everything we possessed with us, &amp; we were very tired &amp; footsore when we reached our destination (Allonville") she is about 20 kilometres from Vinacourt a kilometre is roughly 5/8 of a mile  We passed a few French soldiers on the way they were navvying on the roads<br/>When we are on the march we have regular spells, the first half hour we have 5 minutes, &amp; from then every hour we have 10 minutes, so you can see we don't have to much loafing &amp; we keep a fair pace up all the time.<br/>News is just through tonight of a success the 4th Division have just had where they relieved us at Fleurbaix, it was not true about the men</p>
