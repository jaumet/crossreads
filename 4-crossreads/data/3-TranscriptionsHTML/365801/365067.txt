<p>Dear Mr Roland,<br/>Just a few lines.  I attach a letter, I have just received from Col. Lamrock, which explains itself.  I feel certain you will be pleased to know when he sails, as the Committee will no doubt desire to meet him on arrival.  We were all sorry to lose him, but his health has not been of the best &amp; besides he is a little too advanced in years for the strenuous times we are having here.<br/>The 20th has had a rough time in France as we lost Lts. Connor, Porteous &amp; Blanchard last month, &amp; the day before yesterday Capt. Ferguson &amp; Lt. Campling were killed.  The last knock is felt very much by the battalion, particularly in the case of Capt. Ferguson, who was a general favourite &amp; a fine</p>
<p>[Lieut. Albert Edward Campling.  Lieut. Norman George Blanchard]</p>
