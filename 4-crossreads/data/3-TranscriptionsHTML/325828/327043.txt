<p>Last Tuesday week I had &frac12; a day off &amp; went up to Cambridge.  It is a great City &amp; I had a good look round the four Universitys there, Trinity, Kings, Clare &amp; Queen's Colleges.  The famous lawn at Cambridge which attracts crowds from all over London is indeed fine &amp; beautiful<br/>The winding river, with grass meadows   <strike>u</strike>   right down to the edge, spanned frequently by quaint artistic bridges, &amp; dotted here &amp; there by boats in which students lounged &amp; studied, formed a very pretty picture.  I was very glad to get away from the bustle &amp; roar of London even for such a short time.<br/>Last Saturday afternoon another chap (from the Furlo' Section here) &amp; I went to Richmond &amp; got a rowing boat, on the river (Thames) &amp; pulled about 8 or 9 miles up the river.  The scenery was gloriously pretty &amp; we had a rattling good time.  It is quite light right up till &frac14; past 9</p>
