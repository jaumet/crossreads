 I haven't seen a piano since the night at Tunbridge Wells.  Mrs. Johnston sent me another parcel of eats the other day, wasn't it great of her, I think shes a brick.  The contents were so welcome.  I get so full of bully beef stew &amp; bread &amp; jam &amp; tea. 
 Well I must flee.  Do you ever hear of Alison &amp; Duncan now.  I heard Duncan had got a commission.  I haven't heard from Joe Kirby, one chap told me he had gone to an Officers training school.  I hope he gets one too. 
 So long, love to the Boss &amp; Mac &amp; Graham &amp; yourself. 
 Yours as ever Wilk
