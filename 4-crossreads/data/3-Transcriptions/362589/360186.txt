<p>comfortable dugout on the post &amp; hope to still not have to shift.<br/>I have a wonderful orderly who will turn me out the best Christmas dinner on the Peninsula.<br/>I am glad yet sorry that Keith is coming along.  Suppose it had to come. I hope he will have better luck than Arthur you have done your share anyway.<br/>Best love to Mrs Ferguson &amp; Dorothy &amp; everyone. I would give a good deal to be back again even Joe Carlos' voice would be music.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately<br/><u>Caesar</u></p>
