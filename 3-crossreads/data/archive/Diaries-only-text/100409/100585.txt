after breakfast as no servant now. Started walking down to office but a Canadian civilian gave me a lift into town. He took me to Denzel Hotel to meet a Canadian who was taken prisoner April 1915 at Ypres. Went for walk around streets and met several Canadians, also a Mr Carlyle who has a brother in Melbourne working at the Commerce Building, also he had a nephew in 48th Btn.
In afternoon went for drive in motor with Mr Haswell out to Van Nuys and Hollywood going via the Laurel Canyon which is very pretty. 
Left my nail scissors to be ground when I arrived back. When arrived home received letter from Cockcroft at Frisco re "Venture?. This morning went to Oceanic Coy local office and also saw them re the "Ventura?.

Went to office on tram with Mt Mathews. Left 10 am in a motor with Mr Painter and went out 50 miles to the San Francisquito hydro-electric power station. Went out via San Fernando valley, and had dinner at Sawyers with the men. Went thro some rough mountain country right up to Francisquito Canyon. The water buckets on water wheels each weigh about 300 lbs and there are 20 or 30 on each wheel ? wheels each about 15 ft diameter. Power house situated at end of a syphon.
On way back went right up a gorge and saw the falls where water goes down timber flues ? did some real mountain climbing to get up, a false step probably meaning a broken neck in a fall to bottom of gorge.
Arrive back at house 5.30 pm after a very enjoyable outing. Very windy all day.
