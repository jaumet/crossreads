<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here,at Munster, the camp quarters were indeed very I substantial for the different Barracks were built of brick and Bin pre-war days had been military barracks.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smile now when I think of the first meal we ate after<br/>coming out of " clink". I didn't at the time for I was sick for I a week, and I wasn't the only one for my two pals had my same I complaint - an overloaded stomach.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was amazing the graft that went on in this camp.<br/>I Compasses, civilian clothes, maps and everything that was needed | in the escaping line could be bought in the camp. Civilian money<br/>was not in circulation amongst the prisoners but it was there - I in large notes too. The manufacture of compasses was particularly I cute. A French prisoner in the camp/used to go out and work at a Jeweller's shop in Munster every day and return back to the I camp at night time. At his trade the necessary glass and metal I were stolen and in his recreation hours at night the finished I article was made, the steel needle being magnetised from the dynamo that drove the camp picture show. A couple of tins of I meat, dripping or jam from our parcels would always work the oracle. Civilian clothes would be cobbled up by the Russian I camp tailors and then be camouflaged with the prison red stripe I on trousers and coat - all for the same manner of repayment as above Our stay in the camp was short lived for on the third I day we were told to hold ourselves in readiness to be moved off I to our commands at Dusseldorf,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was certainly a strange action of the German Government I to send escaped prisoners back to the place where they had escaped from, but the action was probably due to this reason -so I many Englishmen were making attempts to escape merely to get I moved to some different work that might be easier than the job I they were at.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this camp football and boxing were allowed to be I played on Sundays and great games used to be watched between the French and English teams, We were fortunate to see the camp I picture show, run under the supervision of some enterprising I German, and amongst the films which were probably pre-war, was one showing scenes around Sydney Harbour and also the Old Show Ground on some Easter Show week.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving camp we were subjected to a strict search,<br/>I having to strip whilst our clothes were searched. Our paper I money was concealed in cigarettes and our precious compasses and I map in a bit of soap. So that when we left the camp we had not I only gained experience but were also better equipped for our next escape, which, on account of coming winter, had to be very soon.</p>
