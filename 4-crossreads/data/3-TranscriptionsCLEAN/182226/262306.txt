Met Norm Matthews, he has been here six weeks & is going to England, lucky chap.
Lord & Lady Methuen with their daughter visited the hospital. They were very decent & we were very pleased to see them.
Managed to borrow a bob off Norm, the first money I have had in my pocket for 2 months, it was truly the "Breaking of the Drought".
We get paid 2/- per week here but we can get more when we go into the convalescent camp.
The situation in the Balkans is in a pretty serious condition. By the way things are going there will probably be a big upheavel there shortly. I hope that it turns out all right.
