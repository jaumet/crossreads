  
 74 October 15th General meeting held today when Lewis presided. He said that after 2 months hard work with the Germans, working in with them for the benefit of all officers, the Commdt on his return from leave, has frustrated all his plans - So Lewis has decided not to have any further transactions with the Hun & is going to do his utmost to annoy them. If he has the Confidence of we Eng Officers - He cannot see why we should be prepared to work in with the Hun & receive nothing in return. 
 The Commdt is greatly disliked. He will not allow officers to carry sticks on walks - he will not permit any paper or pictures larger than size of a PC posted on wall after several marks worth of paper had been purchased at canteen - 
 This afternoon numerous officers were playing Rounders & making a most awful noise, just to annoy the Commdt. It had the desired effect, because He & the adjt soon appeared, furious as I have ever seen a hun, & convened a special roll call. He said there was too much noise & cancelled our walk for 1 day - after roll call, Lewis & the Germans had a conference, when the former explained in very few words our grievances &c, so the Commdt, having wind up crawled down the ladder & said that He would write to Karlsruhe,
