  
 We had mostly come through these places by night, or by forced marches & before did not have much time to admire the scenery. Just after passing the house where John the Baptist was born one sees a fine view of Jaffa, Ramley, Ludd & the sand hills with the blue Mediterranean in the distance. There are also terraces upon terraces of stone & in some places the road runs perilously close to a sheer drop of many hundred feet. We arrived at Latron about 4 pm & camped for the night.
