<p>through a Chateau garden on the Somme, it is very beautiful. Parade again this afternoon<br/>Monday 23rd  on The Somme<br/>Left Pont Remy about 5 Am had a walk of 8 miles, very cold, boarded motor lorries, the motors took us about 40 miles, through Flixecourt to Amiens then a rest for about an hour then another walk of ten miles, the hardest day since the Tel-el-Kebir march. I never saw so many motor lorries, there were hundreds of them lined up on the road waiting for us.<br/>The walk at the finish was awful, never saw such mud, had to drop off near the finish, could not keep up, but came on slowly, a good many dropped out.<br/>I &amp; another Sig. for the present are attached to A Coy. temporarilly, &amp; just now this Coy is in reserve we are camped on a hill, freezing cold especially at night. The night we arrived here the most of us had to camp out. only a few tents, it was the coldest night I have ever experienced, though I had two blankets I could not sleep much though very tired from the forced march. In the morning the ground was covered with frost.<br/>Oct 26th<br/>The two coys. have returned</p>
