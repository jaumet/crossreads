<p>not in their long before it started to rain &amp; everybody had to seek cover, there were a large number of people about with their children, but as it was too wet the Elephants &amp; Llama Rides were cancelled, in between the Showers, I strolled around into several houses containing Animals of all descriptions. One house contained a lot of Australian &amp; South African Birds of all sorts. The Bears Place is built of Stone &amp; raised up from front to back like a Rocky Hill with stone walls around the Sides &amp; Iron Bars in the front &amp; their House at the Back, there were two lovely Polar Bears, pure white &amp; beautiful specimens, the Lion &amp; Tigers Etc are in cages inside a large house which is heated in the Winter, as it was continually raining I made my way back to a Bus &amp; back to the Club &amp; had Tea, &amp; afterwards walked down the Strand to the Garrick Theatre to see the Spy Drama "Pidgeon Post" which was well played, &amp; had a crowded house, coming out <strike>at</strike> after 10 Pm I promenaded until 11 Pm &amp; then back to the Club for Supper &amp; into Bed at Midnight.
