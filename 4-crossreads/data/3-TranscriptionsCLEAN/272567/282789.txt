  
 26/11/18 St Souplet - Le Cateau were very slippery. Plenty of troops were in the town of Le Cateau & it does not seem much damaged. The church has two quaint towers and has been shelled. Pushed on to Corps Headquarters and there attended a conference of all the Brigadiers and Divnl commanders of the AIF - a historic gathering. Had a talk to General Gellibrand who was in good form. Saw General Birdwood and had a short yarn with him. He made a speech saying John Monash was to go to England as Demobilization Director and that Sir John Hobbs was to command the Corps. Discussed all the plans for demobilization. Returned to Bde. at dark & held a conference.  Brazenor back. Arranged for car at 10 tomorrow.
