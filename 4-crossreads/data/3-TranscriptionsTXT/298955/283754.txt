 33 &ndash; E deM it the following was posted within an hour of the above notice- Capt. Superintendent H.M.S.Dockyard  Halifax Commanding officer "Anchesis" Sept 19th 1917. It is regretted it is impossible to give permission to any officers (?) or men from transports in Port to visit the Shore tomorrow Thursday, unless for urgent duty reasons. 6 p.m. Unsigned (Stamped) H.M.S.Dockyard, Halifax. So after once more looking forward to going ashore we were again disappointed. Of course the officers accompanied by the nurses got ashore alright ready and waiting first thing in the morning and did not show up again till late in the evening. Some of the men took their disappointment very hard but having seen such a lot of troopers at Fremantle W.A. and what happened in each case when the men got ashore, I was neither surprised nor greatly disappointed. This town of Halifax is a dry one, beer and spirits have been cut out since July 1st
