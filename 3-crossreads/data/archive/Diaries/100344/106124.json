Field Marshall\u00a0William Riddell Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood, (13 September 1865 ? 17 May 1951) was a WW1\u00a0British general who is best known as the commander of the ANZACs during the Gallipoli Campaign\u00a0in 1915, where 'Birdie's' serene courage won the admiration of all. His concern for the soldiers and his fighting spirit became important factors in Anzac morale.\u00a0<br>\r\nBois Grenier page 10 ? is a village about 10 kms SE of Steenweerck and about 4 miles west of Armentieres.<br>\r\nBolton page 6 - is about 20 kms NW of Manchester.<br>\r\nCaestres page 20 ? is Caestre about 12 miles NW of Croix-du-bac.<br>\r\nCalis page 21 ? is Calais.<br>\r\nCardinette page 23 ? is Cardonette.

Doullens is a town about 6kms north of Beauval.<br>\r\nEastleigh page 5 ? is about three miles north of Southampton.<br>\r\nEbblingham page 21 ? is Ebblinghem about 3 kms east of Renescure.<br>\r\nEnfilade page 60 ? this means the Germans can fire at the Allied troop positions from the side.  More technically a formation or position is \"in enfilade\" if weapons fire can be directed along its longest axis.  For instance, a\u00a0trench\u00a0is enfiladed if the opponent can fire down the length of the trench.<br>\r\nErquinghem page 20 ? is Erquinghem-Lys is about 1 km SE of Croix-du-bac.<br>\r\nFolkestone page 5 ? is on the south coast of Kent.<br>\r\nHalloy page 42 - is about 8 miles NNE of La Vicogne.<br>\r\nHarponville page 45 ? is 10-12 miles due east of La Vicogne.

Hill 60 was a low rise on the south of\u00a0Ypres and  was named after the 60 metre contour which marked its bounds. It was a strategically significant area of high ground coveted by both sides for the duration of the war and had been captured by the\u00a0Germans in 1914. In April 1915 The Royal Engineers built six mines (tunnels) which were filled with around 10,000 pounds of explosives. The resulting explosions flung debris almost 300 feet into the air and scattered it for a further 300 yards in all directions.<br>\r\nLa Vicogne page 42 ? is about 10 miles WNW of Warloy-Baillon.<br>\r\nMillencourt page 46 ? is about 6 miles E of Contay and is about 3 miles W of Albert.<br>\r\nPoperinghe page 57 ? is Poperinge which is now in Belgium about 10kms from the French border and about 12 kms west of Ieper or Ypres.<br>\r\nPozieres page 25 ? is about 5 miles NE of Albert.<br>\r\nPoziers Road page 48 ? is Pozieres Road which runs from Fricourt (about 3 miles east of Albert) north to Pozieres<br>\r\nRenescure page 21 ? is about 12 miles WSW of Caestre and about 6 miles due west of Hazebrouck.<br>\r\nReubempre page 23 ? is Rubempre about 6 miles north of Cardonette.<br>\r\nSalient page 59 ? A\u00a0salient\u00a0is a battlefield feature that projects into enemy territory. The salient is surrounded by the enemy on three sides, making the troops occupying the salient vulnerable. <br>\r\nSap page 30 ? Sap / Sapping: In trench warfare, small 'sap? trenches were dug at roughly ninety degrees out from existing lines. Then a new trench line was dug at the front of the saps. This was a slow, but relatively safe, way of moving forward.\u00a0<br>\r\nSt Omer page 21 ? west of Rensecure as is Arques, (not spelled Arquis).<br>\r\nSausage Gully page 34 ? This was a valley about 400 yards wide and about half a mile long, on the rise at the head of which ran the Contalmaison road (between Contalmaison and Pozieres). The gully, in addition to being the main avenue for traffic to and from the battle zone at this part of the front, was packed with artillery of every calibre, which kept up a continuous fire on the enemy. It was to this busy spot that the wounded were borne from the front line by stretcher bearers and transferred to horse and motor ambulances. The movement of men and transport gave the gully a scene of indescribable activity and the German artillery fire made it as unhealthy as it was busy.

This is not written clearly but is probably Talmas (pronounced Talma) which is about 2 miles south of La Vicogne.<br>\r\nTara Hill page 51 ? Tara\u00a0Hill is not a local place name but one given by certain battalions of the Northumberland Fusiliers, known as the ?Tyneside Irish?, to the hill which rises just east of Albert. (Tara is the famous hill in County Meath where the High Kings of Ireland reigned in ancient times.).<br>\r\nTaubes page 47 ? a Taube was a German warplane with very distinctive wings.  They were shaped like birds? wings.  The tail was also flared like a bird's.<br>\r\nWarloy page 24 ? is Warloy Baillon about 6 miles east of Rubempre.<br>\r\nWinchester page 5 ? is about 5kms north of Eastleigh.<br>\r\nWizbang page 59 ? or Whiz-bag was a German shell that made that sort of noise<br>\r\nYpres page 57 ? is about 12 kms east of Poperinge.
