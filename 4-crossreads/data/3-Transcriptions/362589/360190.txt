<p>I fancy he said other things <strike>regarding</strike> to be conveyed to Miss Laidly &ndash; Possibly to his mother also, if so, I don't know, for Lindy and I never speak of these things and happily knows nothing definite of these unhappy questionings which beset my mind as a doctor. He died at sea &ndash; and was buried between Imbros and Samothrace &ndash; I wish to God I was there, who am tired and uninterested - <strike>while</strike> and that Archie, alive, well, and capable, could at least risk his unconsummated life by trying this world some time longer. God rest him. It is unspeakable sorrow to think of the waste of the young &ndash; and the survival of the old and ailing. I cheat my heart inlox kind of make believe consolation. &ndash; I say he lived 25 years well happy &amp; successful &ndash; and giving us happiness and no pain &ndash; He was in the job he liked better then medicine &ndash; and he died in the "bonfit of life" and went to his death in exaltation &ndash; Perhaps too he was spend disappointment disethening  - sickness and all &ndash; I even listen to the sad words that poor lovely heartbroken Robert from a dug-out or trench writing his simple little manly letter to me (when he learnt of my brother's death) concludes &ndash; "Perhaps after all death is not such a very great misfortune" &ndash; But nothing, nothing on earth gives one more comfort &ndash; or brings back this dead boy &ndash; in whose career I had received even my own tepid ambitions, glad long years ago.<br/>* Robert only heard of Archies death seven weeks later through letters from his mother and Stephanie and yet they went hence from family close together.</p>
