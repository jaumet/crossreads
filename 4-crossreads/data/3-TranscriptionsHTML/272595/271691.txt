<p>I have had for once a very easy day, to fill in the time I have been getting ready for tomorrow.<br/>16th.  Drew my leave money yesterday &amp; paid my Mess bill which at 6d. a day soon runs into money if let go too long, also paid my money for tickets to Wales.<br/>Handed over my Dental job this morning to Sgt. Bourke he is going to take it on while I am away, I'll bet he will curse it for a start  Left Warminster for Cardiff this afternoon, our train was only an hour late but that seems to be nothing these times, had a fairly slow tiresome trip to Bristol where we had to change, we were delayed here about an hour before we got clear, &amp; arrived in Cardiff at 9 oclock, she appears to be a good sized place &amp; very dirty</p>
