<p>[1st Aug. contd]<br/>good &amp; it was still raining &amp; as I had  a bon by head I stopped in bed.  The news which subsequently came thro was good &amp; we learnt that an advance had been made on a 15 mile front to a depth of 4 &frac12; miles in one part and the villages of Bixchoote, St Julien, Hooge &amp; other places were captured &amp; 5000 prisoners &amp; 8 guns.  Rained has interfered with further action.  Germans had counter attacked but we have regained all the ground lost.  Our party returned after being on duty about 50 hours without a spell in water up to their knees.</p>
