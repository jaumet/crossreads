Monday 30th
We slept very soundly till about 9, when the Cooks woke us up and said Break. was ready "Blue" Riley and "Joy" Keller got up and brought Break to Bed for the rest of us, which we greatly appreciated, Bacon and good hot tea. My word a drink of tea is good, these times. Jack Keen lit the fire and we stayed in our blankets for a while longer, as we were all very tired. None of us have shaved since we left >u>Strazeele and we are beginning to look like scarecrows, so we made an effort and managed to shave before we went to dinner. We had dinner at 11 and "fell in" at 12, so as to relieve the 14th in good time. We came out to Mc Cormacks Posst, which is that worst of the lot. Arrived here at 8 oclcok. The 14th did not expect us till 2. and were having dinner, so we had to buzz round in the wet and cold till they had finished. There were about 36 in our party with Capt Lloyd, Lorry Trousdale, and Serg. Roberts in charge, as there were not enough dug-outs, we had to "turn to" and dig one. Stan Wright, Billsy, Snowy Atherton and I are still working together, and we soon made a hole big enough for 4 of us, which we covered over with stretchers for a roof. Just got it finished when the Rain commenced to pour down and we were flooded out in a very few minutes, but we had to make the best of it. About 5 we were issued with rations, Bread, Cheese, and Bully Beef, but we couldn't get any tea as it was too wet to make a fire. A No. of cases came along, which were taken on by the Horse Sledged 2 men have to go with the sledge, in case anything goes wrong, and it is almost as bad as carrying, is to follow the sledge, through shell holes up to the knees in mud and water. It poured in rain all night and we were over boot tops in mud in our dug-outs the rain was coming in too, so we had to sit there in our clothes, wet through to the skin and pray for daylight to appear.
