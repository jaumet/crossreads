<p>October 1918.<br/>Saturday 5</p>
<p>In read of Johncourt. Bty Position.<br/>Stunt opened at 5/15 am, advance of 1500 yds. 2nd Div pioneers hopped the bags captured a few hundred prisoners. <br/>A wild rumor started to the effect that we are going out of action for a spell. As usual turned out to be that we are not going out but going up farther forward to a new position near Ramicourt.<br/>After all we did not move today either forward or back. Jocks have been burying their dead all day.</p>
