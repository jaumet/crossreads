Very happy to anounce a new project: Crossreads

Crossreads is about breaking lineality of narratives. 
Firstly we segment a text or collection of texts into small pieces. Then we calculate several kinds of similarity among pieces. Finally, a web app allow crossreading of the original texts.
Those new created narratives (path through pieces of text) produce a different effect on brains reader that the ussualy expected by the autos in a tradicional, linias reading.
