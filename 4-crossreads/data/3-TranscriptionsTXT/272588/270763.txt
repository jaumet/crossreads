Sunday 1 SeptemberNothing doing here at Morcourt which is now miles from the war.  In fact we can't hear the guns & can only just see the balloons.
Monday 2 SeptemberA walk this afternoon to Proyart from where our division hopped off last stunt.There are now two C.C.S.'s there now. Saw a number of German guns including three 5.9 navals in position. Changeable weather. On our front Mont St. Quentin & Peronne have been taken.
