<p>475<br/>The New Zealand people can object to me transferring into the British Army &ndash; I don't think they liked me resigning my commission after going to the trouble of getting it for me &ndash; However I am going to try very hard to get matters fixed up during my furlough &ndash; I am looking forward to getting away from here 18 weeks is a long in one spot, especially a hospital.</p>
