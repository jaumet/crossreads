going and coming.  There was a motley collection on the roads.  Traction Engines, Motor lorries, Ambulances, Tanks by the hundred, Artillery of all kinds (18 pdrs., Anti's, Hows, Navals, & Tanks), Ammunition wagons, Cavalry, Infantry, Motor bicycles and cycles, just one continual stream on both sides of the road.  We went through Daours, Aubigny and Hamel.  While we were hung up on the road I was speaking to a chap on a tank who said they could carry 50 men and travel 10 miles an hour.  Got back to camp about 3 a.m. and went to bed.
