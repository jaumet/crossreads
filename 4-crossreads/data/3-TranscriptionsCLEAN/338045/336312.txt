  
 6th October - Friday Hot & close & has been so for at least 4 days.  This sort of weather freezing cold, then rain & hot makes one always uncomfortable.  An order read to us by our intelligent officer to cut down our letters, too lazy to censor them.  This is about the greatest insult I have had offered me.  Nothing of note to-day. 
 7th October - Saturday A cold day & windy but after work at 12-30, lunch & a most pleasant & interesting afternoon.  With Palliser & Legge, at 2 p.m. we go to the Museum
