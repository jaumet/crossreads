<p>We reached the town of Bologne here after the usual pleasant? Train journey and I put up at the Hotel Louvre, ordering a bed for a very small fee and then went in search of a good "feed" which I got further afield (or should I say a village) anyway I had a good meal with an Irish doctor belonging to the 29th Division and an Aust Capt of the 2nd Div A.S.C. and "my head was like to burst when I had partaken thereof" and I had much difficulty in getting to sleep.</p>
