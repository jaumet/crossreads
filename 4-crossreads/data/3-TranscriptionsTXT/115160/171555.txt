 Darling Mither, 
 Sunday again, a glorious fine day and yesterday too, but everything was white with frost this moring, and thin layers of ice on the puddle-holes. &nbsp;I hope the fine weather continues. 
 Last night I sent Dad an &quot;Aussie&quot; and you and Bess some cards, which I hope you will receive safely. 
 Well, the war is not&nbsp;over yet, and it looks as if the Hun is doing as much hoodwinking as possible. &nbsp;There is a limit tho&#39;&nbsp;and he will come a horrible gutser yet, I&#39;m thinking. 
 I haven&#39;t had any mail during the week for none has reached us from the Column. &nbsp;Last week we received our extra blanket and winter issues.

 On our way to Germany. 
 What great news it is - the war is over! &nbsp;We are victors, and have come out on top at last. 
 I have not much to say at present. &nbsp;I hope you are all in the best of health and spirits. 
 I will continue at the first opportunity. &nbsp;I am OK. 
 Fondest love to all, 
 Your loving Son
