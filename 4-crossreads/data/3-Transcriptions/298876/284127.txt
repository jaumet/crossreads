<p>Thursday<br/>17/2/16</p>
<p>Feel a good bit better, done my shift, although I did not feel too bright. Has left me a very heavy cold.</p>
<p>For the first time today we got Boat drill, we night men were rudely awakened by the steam whistle blowing &ndash; men rushing all roads to don their life belts &ndash; Drs - Sisters &ndash; Officers, etc all to their alotted places. The A.G.H. men &amp; Doctors &ndash; also all A.M.C. men who are on Hospital duty at the time take up their positions at Hospital &amp; also see that each patient is provided with a belt. Field Ambulance &amp; L.H.F.A. men fall in with the Units to whom they are attached.</p>
<p>Saw hundreds of I think Dolphins, they seem to be identical to our Porpoises, but smaller in size, they look just like a lot of pigs frolicking in water.</p>
<p>Sea a bit choppy. <strike>a nice cool breeze blowing &ndash; from North </strike>Raining all the afternoon.</p>
