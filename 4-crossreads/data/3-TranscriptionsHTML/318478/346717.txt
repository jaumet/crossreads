<p>March <strike>4th</strike> 5th 1919</p>
<p>To-day dear Mick the Sun has been splendid and I have been at it from about seven sparrow song to sundown.</p>
<p>I managed to get my sketch of the knife edge otherwise known as the Sphinx from pluggies &ndash; finished &ndash; this morning.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I did a picture not a sketch of Anzac Cove, chiefly Palette Knife, and quite like it.  Spruce seemed to catch the seriousness of the afternoon and made tea in an old billy he found on the beach saying as she boiled.  Now Sir you can enjoy yourself as an Australian should.  Either the water or the billy was foul and the tea was not a success.</p>
<p>About sundown when we were due to come home the mule broke hobbles, telephone wire &amp; chain &amp; bolted through a communication trench into Shrapnel gully &ndash; Spruce surprised himself in tactics and chased her through a honeycomb of trenches finally jumping almost on top of her head from the parapet</p>
