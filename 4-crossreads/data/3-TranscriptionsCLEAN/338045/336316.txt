we are off (I & thirteen sixteen others) to the Base Details Etaples.  The excitement & noise of the rest of the morning prevents work & we get pay.  The afternoon off to report in full equipment at 9 a.m. to-morrow, ready to leave.  Until 5-30 p.m. I am taken up with making all my arrangements & sending home by post my parcels.  Meet the Belge & with him & Legge we have a fine little parting dinner in a Restuarant in Rue Lafayette & I take my parting from our mutual little friend Belge (Marcel Doutreloux).
