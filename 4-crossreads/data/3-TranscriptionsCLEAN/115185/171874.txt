Mrs Dick who is going out to Australia will take this letter to you & post the copy to Jocelyn & Rosamond in England who will show it the Grandmother & then post it to Aunt Maria - who will if possible post it to Gibson. I may write other letters but not another about these first days. I shall try to forget them. Much love to you all. I think of you all & long to be home X Devotedly your daughter Betha McMillan X But I want to stick to it till the war is over.
