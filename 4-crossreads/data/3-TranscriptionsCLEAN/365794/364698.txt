  
 Monday 22 October 1917 Very hot, sea like glass & scarcely a ripple.  6 swallows sit & gaze at me as I "do my mile" (S. Roach) 7 a.m. & read Maxwell & Pope. As usual when a crowd of persons are penned up every trifle is huge & an anonimous letter falling into Miss Ralston's hands has been made into a huge crime.  Dr. Parry 10 a.m. (23-10-'17) shut us all in Smoke room and after reading an ad. for private detective, supposed to be written by a "sister" threatened us with being put under open arrest & handed over to the authorities at Suez.  How would our friends at home regard such news?  Had we been informed at first coming on board what were the rules for us much trouble would have been averted & quarrels avoided. Sun sets on our left hand at 6 p.m. & already the twilight is longer with such peaceful soft skies.
