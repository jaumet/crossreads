<p>another eight kilometres. We had no idea where we were going, except that we were going forward. Then we were halted at a cross-road &amp; was told that we had to lay out there for the night &amp; it raining like hell. The end of a perfect day. "Somme" twenty-four hours, believe me. Well any how we made the best of it, we got wet through, &amp; we wouldn't get any wetter, so we layed down in it.</p>
<p>In the morning we moved up into a wood for the day. After dinner they sent billeting N.C.O's back to the village to prepare billets for us, but at 4 o'clock fresh orders came out, &amp; they were re-called. At 5 o'clock we moved up &amp; relieved the 33rd Bn in front line in front of Villers-Brettonneux. A hot shop.</p>
<p>We were only in for two days when we were relieved by a London Regiment.</p>
<p>We came back to Gentelles Wood in a sorry plight. Wet through, caked in mud &amp; absolutely exhausted.</p>
