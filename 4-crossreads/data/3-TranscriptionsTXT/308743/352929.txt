 Reveille at 5. 
 The whole brigade moved off at seven for a divisional day &amp; the different [indecipherable] regs provided the umpires who are a decent lot our first stop was at El [indecipherable] then we advanced until the contact Sq were in touch with the enemy I had a trip out to El Bira right through the firing line we had to retire as the enemy were proving too strong on our left the infantry were brought into action too late &amp; Gen Godly told Cheval what he thought of it.  Gen Maxwell was present &amp; is quite a notable person in his own way.  We lost the day &amp; returned to camp at 6PM cleaned up the horses &amp; turned in early Bed at 8.30 
 
 27 February 1915 Saturday 
 Reveille at 6. After first parade the order was clean saddlery &amp; generally clean up the bikes &amp; generally overhaul same, the afternoon we had off.  I amused myself with writing letters home, Harold &amp; Bert &amp; I went out to tea &amp; Bert H &amp; myself had a bath after which we participated in supper.  Remounts were tried &amp; one proved a little frisky but was eventually overcome.  Motor bikes finished &amp; a board is to sit on them next week with the boss as president.  Lt Bell has been looking all round Cairo for machines &amp; there is 1 Singer 1 Rudge 1 Douglas &amp; 2 Triumphs so out of the lot we ought to get satisfied at last.  The M P had a parade &amp; were inspected along with their kits everything points to an early departure.  Bed at 9 PM
