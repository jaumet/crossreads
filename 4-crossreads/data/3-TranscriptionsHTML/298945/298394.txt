<p>From here we reached the top of the hill, saw Sailly le Sec, &amp; Corbie church distinctly through glasses, &amp; made a short cut across an erstwhile no-man's land which had suffered a barrage, to the Corby-Bray main road. Then we went along the road towards Corbie, passed a couple of chimney stacks that had suffered three direct hits between them &amp; still stood, until we reached a clump of trees behind which Roy informed us much might be seen.</p>
