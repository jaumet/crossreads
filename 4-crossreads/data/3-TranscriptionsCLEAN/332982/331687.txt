  
 Monday 1st Jan.1917 Very quiet day. The last few days we have been put on half rations and we never get enough to eat. No use complaining to the Orderley Officer. Stew for breakfast, Soup, Roast and rice for dinner no potatoes or any kind of vegetables, Bread and butter for tea, occasionally a little cold meat. Tucker very poor, and sometimes unfit to eat
