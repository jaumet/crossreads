from the front line came on a tree which had the inside of the butt hollowed out and there was a poor old tabby with a brood of young kittens, only a few days old. The trench had been terribly battered by shell fire last night and Lord only knows how the unfortunate felines escaped - we had thoughts of transplanting them to our own gun pits, but eventually decided to leave them as they seemed quite satisfied with their lot, and we should have to leave them when we move - Its an extraordinary thing how many cats come through the inferno of gun fire when these villages are bombarded - Many of them are to be seen walking about  scarred and singed & maimed, but still "carrying on" as if nothing had happened.
