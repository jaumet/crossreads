The Red Cross Bloke
Not a blinking rap do we care for the chapWith the Red Cross on his sleeve,Till we get to the front, on the stand to stunt,and a farewell Bomb when you leave,Midst the flying death you hold your breath,and life seems suddenly dearWhile the Red Cross chap is out of the scrapIn the safest part at the rear.
It don't seem fair for him to be there,While we face the poison an smoke,An' check the Huns with red hot gunsan' cheer, an curse, an choke.But many a lad feels thundering glad,When night lends a sheltering a cloak,To be overhauled by the cloak he's calledThe blooming red cross bloke.

When next I awoke, a Red Cross bloke,Was crossing that zone of deathAn I watched come through the shrapnel humJust watched an' held my breath,Till he reached my side with a crawl an glide,An' I blessed his crimson crest,For he made me snug with a comfy plugOn the painful hole in my chest.Then away he crept, an' I must have sleptFor when I awoke with the pain,
