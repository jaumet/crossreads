<p>winter will remember it all their days.</p>
<p>After coming out from Le Transloy where we simply held the line for a certain number of days &amp; nights we were relieved &amp; again went back to a camp &amp; later moved by train to another part of the line to Fleurs &amp; it being November by the time we got in again the weather was worse than ever as it seemed to be always raining in France &amp; Belgium &amp; the ground waterlogged &amp; the mud, there is no mud in the world to equal french mud (its on its own) &amp; we were three days in Fleurs &amp; the Huns shelled us pretty well all the time</p>
<p>but the day we were coming out was the worst for us, as a shell came quite close to us &amp; burst between two of our men &amp; one chap a sgt never spoke again but the other one was conscious &amp; we got him to say his prayers  while the stretcher bearers were coming to carry him off  when the shelling had died down a bit.  he reached the dressing station but am sorry to say he died there as when he was pulled out of all the earth that had fallen on them I could see by the way his Toes turned inwards that his legs were shattered &amp; he had a piece through his left arm, but the sgt had his legs shattered &amp; a piece through his head.</p>
<p>I was the very next man to them &amp; then on my left there were three other men &amp; when the shell exploded I touched the man on my left &amp; said are you all right Tom &amp; he said yes, then I knew that the others on his left would be alright, but as we were all covered with earth &amp; sulpher I could not see for a few minutes &amp; my ears were ringing with the concussion.<br/>As we were</p>
