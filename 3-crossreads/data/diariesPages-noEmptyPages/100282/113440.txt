thinly, they are getting a good belt out by degrees, you can see from this how thinly our front is held, the Hun is something the same, I had the nice little job of working the "fighting patrol" this consisted of 9 men myself we had to patrol "no mans land" looking for stouch, luckily we found nothing tonight, though if we had followed the plans that Capt Edgely planned out at first there would have been some fun bullets flying, he had the crazy idea of going out with Hales rifle grenades a Lewis Gun, he intended to shoot the grenades into their strongposts then turn the gun on them, the maddest thing I ever heard of what gutsers we would have come he would have chopped the legs from under us for the place simply stinks with machine guns, he Kelleway were going out at first, I nearly died laughing to see the look on poor Kelleways face when Edgely was planning his scheme Charlie is no hero, makes no bones
