 1/8 /19 Cape Town even more dead than befor . Stay on the boat until after dinner and then with the Master took a cab up the town . All decor for peac celebr tomorrow and at the Standard Bank of South Africa a stand erect to view the process . Some fine well stock shop . Saw a fair perform of Peter Pan at the Opera Hous and then went to " Maxim " for supper . Comment here on the cheap of meal . If it were not for the impress and unusu Tabl Mountain I should feel inclin to say that Cape Town would be a dull and ugli place . The nativ are poor weedi wretch look folk .
