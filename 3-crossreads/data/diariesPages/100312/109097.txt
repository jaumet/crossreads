20/10/17 Paris
across the street to Opera Comique where ?Werther" was being produced. A large queue waiting for the pit doors. Had a seat in the stalls ? a fine theatre but nothing like as beautiful as the Grand Opera is. Exits and fire arrangements generally far behind Australia. I should fear a fire here. The music and the opera were both good but not anything like the other operas I have seen here. A pleasant polite audience. Returned home by tube after devilish wandering in all directions owing to being carried past my station. Dodged the usual crowd of girls looking for sleeping companions and turned into bed very tired just about midnight. A very full day with not a moment wasted from rising to returning.
