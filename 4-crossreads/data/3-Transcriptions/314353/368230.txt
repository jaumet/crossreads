<p>November 1</p>
<p>Press, Morris, "The Hollow Land" and priced a guinea: and a dainty neat "Passionate Pilgrim".</p>
<p>On Monday morning I was in there:  and bought as a start Watson's "Pencraft", the back faded finely from its shewing in the window:  and to send home Craig's "Art of the Theatre" and Symons &ndash; some books of his Theatrical essays.  Then I bought "Form", at half a guinea, and later sent it home by Simpsons of Oxford Street, with a lovely vellum leafed book of sonnets, bound in [indecipherable] and with two Cuala books.</p>
<p>Another Charing Cross gem is across from Beaumonts, higher towards Oxford Street:  on the first Saturday that was open, and I bought de Talley's 'Poems and Lyrics', a 600 edition, one of John Lane's 1890 books&hellip;</p>
<p>Drinkwater's 'Olton Pools' was in the window, and Lionel Johnson's "The Art of Thomas Hardy" &ndash; an old vellum covered book &ndash; with the signed etching postmark.  The shop was full of Beardsley's prints, and folios and books of Ballet and the Theatre.  A fine green and ivory large paper edition of Bakst designs of The Russian Ballet held the place of high state in the window.</p>
<p>Frank D. just expressed his desires for the night:  'a Bulletin and a full pipe, and a comfortable bed'.</p>
<p>100.  November 2<br/>George has come up to take the "Duke's" place &ndash; he evacuated yesterday with a burnt and blistered leg.</p>
<p>George arrives with all the ills of the Army &ndash; and deafness.  His gruntings and grumblings are a perpetual delight to me &ndash; when he's not grunting I'm disappointed:  he comes with medicines and now develops a desire for sick parade.</p>
<p>All last night not a plane over:  this morning an even grey sky &amp; for a while a faint drizzling.  Duty tonight, so the hope is for the close greyness continuing&hellip;</p>
<p>101.<br/>Duty:  Dressing.  The night as the day predicted.  Another page of letter to Mother, and a two page writing to Geoff:  parcelled up Coulson's "From an Outpost" with "The Undying Splendour" and Mother's book with Shaw's "The Sanity of Art" and addressed to Geoff.</p>
