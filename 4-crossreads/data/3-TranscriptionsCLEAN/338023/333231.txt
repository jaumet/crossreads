very respectable hills. Our boat is no chicken for size - she's about 9000 tons - but this is treating her with no respect; she bucks & kicks, rolls, flings her  nose up to the skies & wallows in the spray just like any coaster. Not that she is not a fine sea boat - she's one of the best - but in such a devil's cauldron she's all but helpless - a cockle shell lost among hills of water.
This afternoon a few of us got up on deck & climbed on the derricks amidships. We had a nice position there, about 40 feet above water & clear of the waves, thus we were able to watch one of the finest sights it is possible to see in one's lifetime - the centre of a cyclone with its 'pyramid' waves.There's no long even roll about it - only immense pyramids of water lifting up in all directions, massing together & often falling in huge masses of white surf. The roar of these seas is indescribable & looking down, as we rode to the crest of one, we had a view of hills & valleys with what looked like an occasional flat & all clouded with smoke like spray.
