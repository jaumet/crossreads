<p>rear, Longueval &amp; Delville wood not far distant.</p>
<p>Wednesday 29.11.16<br/>Again in charge of wood fatigue.  Heavy fog &amp; frost; icicles hanging all day.  Met Bob from [indecipherable], in 55 Btn.  No canteen here, money of little use.</p>
<p>Thursday 30.11.16<br/>Paraded at 9 AM. but were dismissed &amp; had to stand by in readiness to move out to take over various posts.  Left at 2.30 pm &amp; took over in charge of No 2 post in Delville Wood.  Had very busy time for first 6 or 7 hours with cases of trench feet from front line.  Hundreds coming through, mostly hobbling along with sand bags on their feet. Can quite expect trench feet when the men have to "stand to" in mud up to their knees which freezes during night.</p>
