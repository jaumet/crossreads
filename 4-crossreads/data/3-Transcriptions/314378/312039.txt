<p>The Doctor immediately sent me off to the Hospital ship &amp; we left for Alexandria next day.  But I have the satisfaction of being able to say that I put in the first week at Gallipoli &amp; it was in that week that the fun happened.  I was there right from the start, landing early on Sunday the 25th April, the day that will long live in the History of Australia &amp; indeed of the world.  I was keeping a diary of our trip from Alexandria but after landing there was no time for entrys, not that they are necessary for what I went through that week I will remember all my life, without the aid of a dairy [diary], but as our voyage may interest you I will give you some extracts from the voyage of H.M.T. Derfflinger from Alexandria, Egypt to Gallipoli.</p>
<p>On Friday August 2nd (Good Friday) we received 36 hours notice to embark for an unknown destination.</p>
<p>Saturday 3rd, we left Mena Camp at 10.30 p.m. and foot slogged to Cairo with full pack up arriving there at 1.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Sunday 4th, entrained at Cairo 4 a.m., arrived at Alexandria 11.30 a.m.  Embarked on H.M.T. Derfflinger A.10 a captured German Mail boat.</p>
<p>Monday 5th, loading Biscuits ammunition &amp; the hundred &amp; one things necessary for an army.  Sailed at 8 p.m. for our destination still unknown.</p>
<p>Tuesday 6th, well out to sea, weather rough, many sick, 2,500 men on board, terribly cramped.</p>
<p>Wednesday 7th, sea calmer, men getting about again passing through Grecian Archipelligo, beautiful sight.  On one of the islands there was a city buildt on top of a big hill, all the buildings were white.</p>
