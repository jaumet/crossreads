  
 We entrained at Salisbury at 2. o'clock and proceeded as far as  H Andover. Here we had to change trains again, and a further wait of two hours for our train. 
  H Andover was very pleasing to the eye, with its fine scenery and its quaint streets and environs. 
 We entrained again and finally reached Tidworth at 6 o'clock, then just dusk. A ten minutes walk brought us to the barracks, Tidworth. Here we were enrolled and our barracks allotted to us. 
 Our school began in earnest next day and most pleasant memories of my association with the "Tommy" instructors are still with me. Tidworth is not very beautiful to gaze at, but still with the aid of a good garrison theatre, and a goodly number of shops, a pleasant time could be spent. 
 The area of the barracks in this town must have been easily 11/2 miles square. It was the easiest thing in the world to get lost at night, and wander about for some considerable time, before one happened to hit one's right barrack.
