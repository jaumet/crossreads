July, 1915Wednesday 7Brigadier back from the Dardanelles, Pleurisy & thinner, it is no soft job. We send 120 men & 10 N.C.O's today to fill the gaps but I stay behind.Will probably post this with a few snapshots and silver Piastres.Had 2 letters from Aunt Louie one from Joe, hope his eye no worse; plenty men here with only one eye now. Glad to think May is at home.Mothers letters were dated May 16th & May 30th my love to you all.Personal not to be printed
