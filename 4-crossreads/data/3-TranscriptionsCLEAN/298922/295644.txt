  
 Tuesday 11 December 1917 
  Malta  just heard that Jerusalem has been taken am sorry I was not there  but perhaps it is just as well.   The real reason why we are delayed is "subs" outside. However at 4 p.m. we left with our usual escort after a week at Malta. 
 Last night a  British W. Indies  Boat was wrecked by the gale & 30 lives lost - it is a game of hide & seek to get away from Malta but we dodged the subs by going all round.
