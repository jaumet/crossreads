Moved up to the Reserve Trenches in front of Delville Wood. There has been fierce fighting in this wood, even now it is heaped with corpses. The mud here is sickening; I found a "Tommy" bogged in it, and it took four of us half-an-hour to get him out. He was in a shocking state of exhaustion; but game enough. I marvel how this city bred Englishmen stand it. The flashes of our guns illuminate the whole sky, we are very strong in artillery now. The German lines are visible from here; at night his rockets rise continually, Red, Green, White, and a beautiful yellow one we call "Golden Rain". I have a very wet home here, I'm afraid it will fall in on top of me soon.
