 Tuesday 6 November 1917 Still under Capt.'s orders. Very weak as regards legs.  Sat on balcony &amp; patronised by sweet V.A.D. who promises that if I look out over balcony tomorrow may perhaps see Lady Allenbury?? [Allenby ?] How these English amuse one.  Cobbie arrives 6 p.m. with washed dressing gown &amp; Bystander, then M. Woods with lovely bunch roses, how a word of home changes the whole outlook &amp; after a long chat with each I feel life may one day be worth while again.
