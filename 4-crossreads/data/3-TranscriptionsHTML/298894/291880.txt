<p>Jardine passage</p>
<p>was the best ever we seemed to take a different route.  At one part we passed between two Islands each towering high above us with very little room to spare on either side.  It was from here we saw the Bee stranded having taken about 6 hours on the return journey.  About 10 oclock our ship had manoeuvred within a few hundred yards &amp; tried to tow her off but with no success as the ropes parted each time.  All attempts were given up during the afternoon &amp; various rumours are floating about as to what is going to happen.  About 8.30 another ship arrived &amp; will probably assist in the morning.  My days work generally consists of the following.  Salt water bath 6.30 am Breakfast 7. 9 oclock attend to patients who come to me for treatment.  Free till 11 oclock sick parade when the Doctor attends &amp; all sick men are paraded by non coms for treatment.  At these times I stand by &amp; dole out physic as he orders at 1 oclock Patients under my care attend again.  At 4 oclock Sick parade again At 5 oclock I see regulars again &amp; after that treat special cases only.  In the Hospital itself  the other A.m.e. attend to the patients &amp; I assist generally keeping an eye on everything  Our meals are first class  For breakfast we get fresh meat mutton or Beef &amp; vegetables or perhaps a curry &amp; Rice.  Dinner fresh meats cabbage &amp; potatoes  For Tea  Bread jam butter</p>
