5/9/17 Campagne  Marched out to Le Biberou  at 8.30 and carried out a tactical exercise.  General Plumer of the 2nd Army was present.  A white little man full of honours and monocled.  His comments and questions were very much to the point and highly valuable to have.  All officers assembled after the operation.  A lovely fine morning.  The woods are full of nuts and blackberries and the men killed a hare which was hiding in the undergrowth.  The 7th Bde were working just behind us.  In the afternoon had a sleep and gave the men a half holiday.  Met Jack on the grounds before lunch &ndash; very pleasant riding along.  Took two summaries of evidence for Court Martial cases.  Our planes the last few days have been doing a lot of squadron flying &amp; have a landing place near the ancient Abbaye de Woestine.  The crops about are now well garnered to barns &amp; stocks in the vicinity here.  Reg came in for a yarn during the early part of the evening.
