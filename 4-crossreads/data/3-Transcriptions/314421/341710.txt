<p>Then had a hurried dinner packed up our blankets etc. and left for the new camp at Ypres. We arrived early, but it was not until after dark that our supper &amp; tents arrived. As there were no pegs handy we did not put them up, but camped under waggons.</p>
<p>It was after dark when some of the waggons arrived here. The camp is a very poor one the ground being sopping wet and tramped into mud by our transports &amp; troops.</p>

<p>Fine but cloudy. It was showery last night, but I did not get wet, for we had one tent spread under the pole, &amp; another tent over it. In this 4 of us slept, dry &amp; warm.</p>
<p>As we are surrounded by Batteries, there was one continual roar all night, the enemy being heavily shelled. We had not much sleep. Throughout the day there was lively artillery activity by the guns of various calibres around this camp.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning we passed two batches of German prisoners being escorted to the rear. They were all young men, and most of them boys, but nearly all were of good physique and very sturdy &amp; healthy.</p>
<p>We put up our tents to day. The ground is very wet &amp; muddy. However we got a grassy plot to erect them on.</p>
