 Thursday 5 [6] September 1917 All day in town and fitting at B. &amp; Welsh's.  Reported Barracks 2 p.m. Randwick No. 4 A.G.H. on Friday 6 p.m. 
 Cairo 31st G.H., 5/9/18 And what a changed place from the hosp. where I began my military nursing, very little work on n. duty but long tedious night &amp; noisy days with Gippos shouting all day long at their work in the kitchens. Paid Pt. 90 each for 2 night gowns &ndash; pretty but not very good material &ndash; still, what would you have in a country where one pays Pt. 10 or more for unbleached calico!
