<p><u>CARTIGNY</u>.</p>
<p>A poor old place all in ruins, only a few miles from the last place, but decidedly more &quot;healthy&quot;, although &quot;he&quot; does a good bit of &quot;business&quot; at night, but as there is only a small camp of huts here it does not make me so &quot;windy&quot;, although there are no cellars here.</p>
<p>Dark nights were alright, because our searchlights could easily &quot;get on&quot; to him, but clear moonlight nights were not so successful.</p>
