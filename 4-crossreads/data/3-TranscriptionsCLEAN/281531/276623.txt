 17/8/18 At 1 a.m. all the company commanders and my Bn. H.Q. staff assembled at this spot and to them I issued orders for our attack tomorrow at dawn. It was pathetic in a way discussing the attack with such few numbers and with such tired & wornout men as ours now are. After the O.C.s had gone away I turned in for an hour or two and at 6.15 went down to 23rd H.Q. where I met the General and Col. Brazenor
