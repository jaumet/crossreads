<p>There was a heavy fall of snow last night. This morning was bitterly cold. It was much finer in the afternoon Today and tonight this front is very quiet. I am on first picquet tonight from 6 to 9. It is not very cold considering there is so much snow about. Today it was read out in orders that there is to go 32 men and NCOs and 3 officers on leave to England every week.
