<p>what I could see of it from the steamer, although it looks to be a very clean place.</p>
<p>Soldiers seem to be in the majority here also. Kakhi can be seen everywhere you look. Camps and Military hospitals surround the town, There is also a lot of trees in the place and vegetation seems to flourish here quite well, It is not like the desert a few miles away where you can look for miles with scarcely a sign of any vegetation visible nothing but sand and sand.</p>
<p>It has been boiling hot all day and I have found it impossible to find a cool spot on the whole ship. Awnings are spread above the decks to protect us from the direct rays of the sun but even underneath these the heat makes the tar blister and boil from between the planks of the decks. Flying fish and Porpoises have been about the ship in very large numbers today. I amuse myself</p>
