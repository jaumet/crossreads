The Pris. wher informed of "Visit" &amp; proceedet to the Main Gate.  Previous to departing under "escort" he wher "searched" for any hidden corespondence.  On his return, anything in his possession, also his Clothing wher searched again for anything objectionable.  I hawe seen Pris. being compelled to undress naked previous &amp; after the Visit, while their belongings wher thoroughly searched.  Anything objectionable of course allways got confiscated by the Military.  What has become of these so confiscated Articles or whos property it was after I never hawe been able to find out.  Sufficient is to say, that I hawe seen at least on one ocassion Military Police Sergeant Hughes, confiscating a Bottle of Beer of an Internee wich wher found to be amongst his "Presents" on return &amp; goe inside the Military Tent &amp; drink the Contents.  Owing no Shelter being providet those Internees who recieved Visits applied for Permission</p>
