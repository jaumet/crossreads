 Fritzes credit, he did not fire on them.  They must have been plainly in view.  Now and again during the day he shelled us.  However, the trench was a narrow one, and no one was hit.

One day Company H.Q. was blown in with 3 beautiful shots from the heaviest armour piercing shells.  It was a spacious ex-Hun dugout 20 feet beneath the surface.  Capt Tyson escaped hatless &amp; with
