 
They are of an immense size & fairly give me the creeps. They seem to wait until you put the light out & then they start & very soon the whole floor is smothered with them, kicking & squealing & seeming everywhere. They always follow the battle line up & live on the dead bodies. So you can imagine how ferocious they are.

I took a stroll round the surrounding country last night but feeling fairly tired returned to camp early & tried to go to sleep but what with rats & cold weather scarcely slept a wink.

Poperinghe was heavily shelled last night & yesterday evening & on account of same, all approaches to the City were guarded & no one was allowed to enter. I saw Shayne for the first time for some considerable period & the two of us are going to try to get to London together.

24.9.16 Sunday

Today has again been fine & everything that one might desire. The front has been a little more active & all night long the chit chat of machine guns & the familiar hiss of travelling shells penetrated the air & made sleep very hard for a long time. Situated on a hill, as our camp is, the ground.
