<p>tired.  I could scarcely drag one foot after the other. Billeted in a barn for the night,  it was "Tres bon" lying on the straw.</p>
<p>Tuesday 18th September 1917.<br/>On the march again,  leave the barn at 9 o'clock &amp; arrive at our destination which turned out to be a big Rest Station at 2 p.m. Whilst on the march we crossed the border of France &amp; Belgium. Plenty of work in hand for the Ambulance as the Rest Station was full of patients. I managed to procure my old job again &ndash; on night duty in the baths. The guns could be heard quite plainly during the night as we are much nearer the Line at present.</p>
<p>Wednesday 19th September 17.<br/>Spent a few hours in --- a large town about as big as Albert. The place was a busy scene the streets were alive with traffic, so there is evidently going to be "something doing" around this vicinity. From different reports I expected to see the town in a battered state, but I was rather surprised on seeing the place it is not near as bad as Albert. I could not help noticing how much cleaner the Belgium people are to the French. During the night the booming of guns was exceptionally loud. Fritz is evidently getting a hot time. On arriving back at my diggings, I found that the Bearers were standing by,  unexpected orders had been received that the bearers were to be ready to move off at a moments notice.</p>
<p>Thursday 20th September 1917.<br/>Before staring on our experiences in the Line I must let you understand &ndash; that I must be very very careful what I say as Censorship Rules are exceptionally strict at present. Its hard lines I know, no one is more anxious than myself to write a full account but I dare not.<br/>At 3 p.m. the Bearers move off by Motor Lorries towards the Straffing &amp; arrive at the Dressing Station about 5 p.m. Troops to be seen in all directions,</p>
