<p>things, but I believe I wrote that I would like to bring Jennie out with me.  I did not know Her very well then.  She is a nice little thing but I could not live with Her always &amp; I could never fall in Love with Her Father or Uncle.  Now I'm in Love with Uncle Tom &amp; Auntie ever so much.  Auntie worries over Ellis &amp; Dave &amp; I as much as you do almost.  Grandma is very old &amp; she worships Harry, does not love Him but worships Him.  He takes advantage of it.  He won't keep Her but sends Her to Auntie Annie or Jennie or anywhere so that He doesn't have to buy her a loaf of bread &amp; yet she gave Him the Farm &amp; every penny of it.  He won't even give Auntie Jennie a pint of milk &amp; Her Husband is fighting for Him while she strives along on 17/6 a week &amp; has been keeping grandma for some time.  Still Grandma thinks the sun shines out of Him &amp; yet He married one of Grandma's Servants &amp; the one she hated.</p>
