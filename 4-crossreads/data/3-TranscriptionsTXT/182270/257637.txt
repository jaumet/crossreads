 FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; windy. Lopping in Top and 
 Middle paddocks in morning. Tickle 
 fixed up Mountain mill stand 
 in afternoon. He tightened up 
 everything &amp; rammed the legs. 
 I collected the dead wool from 
 Cow, Boundary &amp; Mountain paddocks 
 Alan &amp; the others went down to 
 Merton in the big car.
