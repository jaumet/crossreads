France. 24.12.17.
Dear Bett.
I have been promising that I would write to you next, so here goes. though there is very little news of any great interest. Still I daresay that I can rake up a little. About the 18th or 19th a change set in and the weather commenced to freeze in real ernest, a heavy mist helped to make things just a little more uncomfortable than they might have been, but when the mist froze on the Trees, it made the place look rather pretty, and for awhile, I thought that we were in for a white Xmas, but a couple of days, ago, a thaw started, and in the night the mist lifted, and for the first time since we landed here we were able to see the country round, now the weather is very unsettled and there may be rain snow, or perhaps it may be fine for Xmas. Tomorrow we will know for certain. now I am going to curl up in my blankets and go to sleep, for it is growing too cold
