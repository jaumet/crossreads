Feb. Saturday 24 1917
The long expected talked of 9th 11th Batt, stunt comes off tonight. 
No one knew anything of the time till 6 p.m. great was the hurry. A feeling of tenseness is in the air as if we were on the eve of something big happening. Many fresh squads have been hurried up from Bazentin. I am unable to go being weak as a chicken. Go to bed but cannot sleep for nervous strain.
