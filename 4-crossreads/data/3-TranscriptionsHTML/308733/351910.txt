<p>anyhow it went it went to my heart to do it later on when we boarded a transport. I was very much tempted to keep them, but decided not to. The latest pattern of bombs are boskers as near safe as it is possible to get. All the mines were blown up before we left but I had the bad luck to miss the sight being inside the lighter, the Turks must have thought we were just about to charge as they turned on a perfect hell of machine guns and rifle fire from all their back trenches, it showed clearly what great strength they were in, they must have lost a lot of men from the mine explosions however. We have heard since that the day we left they bombarded all along the line all day and the following night charged, they swarmed all over the beaches where the destroyers got at them and gave the pi, it was lucky for us that their information was at fault. We were issued with socks to pull over our boots when we were about to leave so that they would not hear us tramping through the trenches.</p>
<p>There was not a hitch anywhere in the evacuation arrangements and every man got safely off.  An enormous amount of gear of various kinds was destroyed and left behind that it would not pay to shift, of course a lot more fell into the Turk's hands it could not very well be avoided. Those who stayed to the last were to be inspected by General Birdwood on arrival here but it was put off &ndash; we hear that an extra clasp will be awarded to us as they seem to regard our achievement</p>
