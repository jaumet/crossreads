<p>&amp; a lot slight. Fritz put no more over that night so all hands had a good rest. <br/>Wednesday 7/8/17.<br/>After Dinner I went into Poperinghe to make some purchases also to get some Colours for the Boys. having to wait for the Colours I went into the Cinema Theatre to see the Pictures. The place was crowded &amp; a good programme was presented including a Charlie Chaplin Film, a very laughable one after coming out I went along for the Colours &amp; Fritz started shelling the Town, while I was waiting in the shop the Lady in charge went along to get some milk <strike>into a building</strike> &amp; while she was coming back a Shell burst close by &amp; some Bricks &amp; Mortar fell on her injuring her severely, some Australians handy rendered First Aid &amp; summoned the Motor Ambulance &amp; she was taken to the Civilian Hospital in Proven a few miles away. After seeing the Lady in the Car &amp; having my colours I left &amp; came back to Camp.</p>
