 Saturday 19 May 1917. 
 No sight of land yet this morning. &nbsp;Everyone looking out for it all the same all day. NO RESULT 
 On no duty today and feel benefit of being above deck in fresher air.&nbsp; 
 A good day at sea all the day, today. &nbsp;Feeling, good oh! now. 
 At 12.15 p.m. we followed the Cruiser &quot;Encounter&quot; in a decided Nth Wstly direction. 
 Believe we are fairly close to land compared to before. 
 Close to &quot;Encounter&quot; all day. 
 Sing-song up on deck in evening 
 G.S.S. Crmn &nbsp; &amp; I thinking where we wold be at this time if on week-end leave in Vic.
