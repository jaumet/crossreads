  
 have the happy knack of just sending what is most needed.  I haven't had a chance of seeing Mr. Budden but he seems to be doing good work.  I was expecting to be losing some of my Officers, to help with the new Division being formed at Cairo, I had to send in the names of 1 officer for Bn. Command & 3 for Compy Comd., but up to the present I have not been drawn on, & I hope I won't, as the losses at Gallipoli, the killed & wounded & sick have left me with a lot of vacancies to fill from the Ranks.  We all felt the death of Majors Jenkins, Harcus & Uther very keenly, they were all such fine men, & their places were hard to fill.  I had recommended Uther for the Legion of Honour decoration about a week previous to his being killed.  With kind regards to Mrs Fergusson & yrself, 
 Yrs sincerely J. Lamrock.
