<p>Marks I will never forget him, my head is fine now I havnt had a semblance of a headache since he fixed me up, when I was thin during my term in bed here the hole in my forehead was very distinct but that is a mere detail tell Dr Marks how I am, dear, fancy him remembering me, at Lewisham he never knew his patients the sister had to tell him, although he knew me by the name of "the frontal sinus boy". In your letters you say you didnt know in what place I had been wounded, you will no doubt know by this as I wrote as soon as ever I could from Kasr-el-Amy Hosp. Dad wrote me a nice letter this time too, poor old Dad is cut up about me tell him not to worry Liz &amp; tell him if I dont write to him too often it isnt because I dont care, he sees all the letters I write to you &amp; I have such a lot to write to. I think I have neglected you too Lizzy in comparison</p>
