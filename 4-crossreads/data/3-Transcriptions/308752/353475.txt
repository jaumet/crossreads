<p>England again Fairford will be the place for me. Caught the Glasgow Express at 9.15 a.m. the following morning. These trains can travel over here, beat anything in Australia. The third class is like our First class. The scenery from the train when day broke was magnificent. Went to the Y.M.C.A. for breakfast &amp; made inquiries about Glasgow. I was advised to take a trip down the Clyde to one of the Locks. I did so, &amp; I shall never regret it, it was the most beautiful trip I have ever had. The steamer left Jamacia Bridge wharf at 10.30 a.m,. Met a very nice fellow on board who was wounded in that stunt last May, so was not on my own for the day. We managed to secure a couple of good seats on the top deck, &amp; met some very nice people there. A couple of girls with there mother were seated quite close to me, so of course I soon made myself known. They were most interesting to talk to, they spend most of their time travelling, they have visited certain parts of America, Germany, France, &amp; Switzerland. The first two miles was an interesting trip, ship building yards on either side, &amp; a busy scene it was. All kinds of craft were being constructed,</p>
