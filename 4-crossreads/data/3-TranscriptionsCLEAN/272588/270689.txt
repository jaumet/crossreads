Thursday 11 AprilGlorious day & very warm. Artillery livened up to-day on this front.Yesterday's rumour has been confirmed by the English papers.  We are not moving to-day but perhaps to-morrow, entraining for the north. The casualties of the Australian Divisions, 3rd & 4th on this front have been very heavy indeed but they have acquitted themselves magnificently, repelling attacks & charging brilliantly with fixed bayonets.Gen. Gough in charge of 5th Army has been recalled over the initial failure to hold Fritz on his front. Had to bivouac to-night & it rained for about 30 minutes. What a short sojourn to the Somme!!
Friday 12 AprilMove from Bertangles this morning, on to Amiens where we are to entrain this afternoon for the north. The front of the Bosche's attack has been extended to twenty miles from La Bassee to the north.  Things here are fairly quiet but he has been shelling Amiens heavily both to-day & yesterday when he put two into the Cathedral.  "O to have seen what I have seen" to-day in marching through Amiens. Many houses have been knocked rotten & all over the place one passes one or two belated refugees with their belongings on their back & on various modes of conveyance.  The roads are crowded with refugees & it makes one more sad than ever over this business.  We entrained at Amiens & drew out of the town for a couple of hours.  Beautiful night & the German 'planes came over in droves dropping many bombs.  One brought down.
