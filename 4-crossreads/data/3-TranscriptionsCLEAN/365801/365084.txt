  
 [Letter from Keith Ferguson, sent in above envelope] My dear father, Here we are at our second port of call, & here we stay till further orders.  Since our arrival we have had a route march every day, but this afternoon we pulled out & anchored in the bay, so it looks as though we have been for our last stroll through the city & suburbs. The town itself is very much like Hobart, looking at it from the stream, & is about the same size.  The population varies in colour from any tint you can imagine to any other tint with a few extraordinary colours thrown in here & there to break the monotony. The above interesting account of our experiences & description of the town & its inhabitants will just about scrape through the censor; but I fear that any further information would be ruthlessly obliterated.  I can only say that our route marches here have given the men not only all the exercise they need but also indigestion
