<p>27.<br/>With 3F. borrowed from Peach yesterday afternoon I went into Marseille to see Louis Raemaekers exhibition of war cartoons.  1.50F. was for a new glass to [indecipherable] &ndash; they"re damned expensive to keep up on15F. fortnight.</p>
<p>Entrance 1F., Catalogue 1F.  I merely entered for 1F.</p>
<p>The Cartoons &ndash; colored prints signed Louis Raemaekers were arranged as a frieze level with the eye right round the room numbering 1 to 100.  No note of explanation accompanied the drawings, but in very few cases was this necessary.</p>
<p>As cartoonist &ndash; especially of the war &ndash; I"ve always looked to Lindsay and Low of the Bulletin &ndash; Partridge of Punch, Carter and Walker of America, and isolated &ndash; Dyson &ndash; his Kultur Cartoons &ndash; and Sullivan &ndash; his Kaiser Garland.  Raemaeker I first heard mentioned by a patient at Ghezireh and he lent me an article from the Times &ndash; if I remember rightly hailing him as the cartoonist of the war.  The first cartoons of his I saw were a few in number of Land and Water &ndash; especially drawn for the paper, but then disappointed more than equalled anticipation.  Then early in April last in Blanchards bookshop in Marseille I saw 6 numbers of a collection &ndash; published in Dutch &ndash; of his work:  6 amongst the collection were in colour &ndash; the remainder in black and white;  these were certainly a revelation to me and only the price and the instruction to Angus to keep me a set of his stuff stopped me then buying.</p>
<p>Lindsay"s type &ndash; his pagan goddesses, his Muses - his women &ndash; such girls and larrikins are all of the same great mother:  its almost impossible to misplace his work.  Dyson the same &ndash; although one of Lindsays I thought for the moment was his.  Low is as rigorous as either, but his style at times might be mistaken for either Lindsays or Dysons.</p>
<p>Minns is merely trading under his name as a colorist:  his cartoon drawings are poor.  Raemaekers is in this exhibition the Raemaekers of 100 moods but all moods of varying degrees of hatred and contempt for Germany and her land:  some are humorous, satirical, but the terrible and horror filled ones prevail.  Of the last, one in particular arrests:  against a bloody wall two murdered men lean in death:  on the floor is a demented woman with all hell in her eyes kneeling and vacantly staring above the corpse of a young girl, dead, stabbed in the side.  Another picturing madness is of two soldiers in hospital beds demented by agony of mind from [indecipherable] - a hospital nurse who has broken down, and the doctor in the background.</p>
<p>Two in particular are intensely fine pieces of beautiful design and color work.  One &ndash; a study in sea green of dead bodies sinking, and last breath bubble rising:  evidently, inspired by the [indecipherable].  The uses of his mediums are as varied as his styles of using them.  One in particular particularly appealed to me:  it was No. 3 and represented the figure of death &ndash; and the scythe moving down the men at war:  the horizon in flame and the figure surprisingly unconscious of the horror of his doing.  The piece had for a background as actual a piece of color work in soft rose-buff as I"ve ever seen and the drawing of the figure was perfect.  The cartoon had all the beauty of an etching, a water color and a pen work in it.</p>
<p>One of the cartoons was used as a poster &ndash; Germany"s last tango &ndash; W to E and from E to W.  It was the already famous cartoon of Germans tangoing with the [indecipherable] figure of death.  There as in the 'Mower" cartoon the drawing of Death was superb.</p>
<p>Far and away above all others is Raemaeker the cartoonist of the war.</p>
