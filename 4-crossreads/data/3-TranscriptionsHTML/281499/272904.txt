Coy. started to sit up &amp; just then the Huns put a big bright flare up &amp; evidently spotted the steel hats he immediately sent 2 or 3 more big flares in rapid succession, &amp; satisfied himself that troops were there, it was not many minutes before the shells started to fly around but happily for us he mistook the wrong trench we were hiding in &amp; all the 5.9's lobbed harmlessly over our head's which was just as well for us, for we would have been murdered in cold blood, slowly the hours dragged by for we were cold &amp; miserable laying on the wet ground, but the Knock out was to come</p>
