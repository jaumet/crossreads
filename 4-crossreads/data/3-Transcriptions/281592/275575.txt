<p>Richmond.  In the evening we went to the "Tivoli".  It was a [indecipherable] provoking entertainment.  Arrived back to the ship about 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>Dec 1st Tues.</p>
<p>Doing fatigue work on the wharf shifting stores.  Got leave at 5 o'clock.  There is not any hope of getting either on or off the ship without a pass.  The bayonet is fixed and pointed at everyone, officer and private alike until the pass is examined.</p>
<p>Went to the "Royal Theatre".  The piece which was entitled the "Yellow Ticket" was a play of very great power.</p>
<p>Dec 2nd W.</p>
<p>Paraded for kit inspection.  Had leave from about 1 o\clock.  Walked along the banks of the Yarra Yarra for a bit.</p>
<p>Visited the Aquarium and spent a most interesting time there.  There are many fine exhibits there and entertainments were going on at various places during the day.</p>
<p>Dec 3rd Th.</p>
<p>Fatigue work scrubbing and polishing in the Hospital on board the ship.  Later, down the hold shifting tins full of biscuits.  The place was dark and there was very little room to work.  We had to double ourselves up to work.  We were out of sight of the N.C.O,'s so had some jolly good fun.</p>
<p>Dec 4th F.</p>
<p>Put on to the Sanitary Squad for a week along with four others</p>
