<p>Miss Graham came with us in the afternoon to Coast Hospital.<br/>All of us met Matron at 1.30.pm  &amp; took tram for Coast Hospital, had a very enjoyable time. It is a wonderful place on the coast about 9 miles from Sydney  &amp; a most interesting tram ride. We had afternoon tea there &amp; saw all over the different buildings. <br/>Got back to Sydney  about 5.p.m. Went to Grahams, had a cool drink  &amp; then hurried down town  &amp; did a little shopping. Had tea (oysters &amp; coffee) &amp; then walked around the streets looking at the shops. Then we two (Dorothy    &amp;  I) had a nice hot bath at the Grand Central, paid 1/- each. but it was worth it. Went back to Kyarra, &amp; our last trip around Sydney. Slept fairly well that night. Steamed-up at 6.a.m.  &amp; sailed out to Farm Cove at 7.30.a.m.  Had breakfast &amp; then went on deck to watch the other nurses. A small steamer came along side of our boat, with 25 more sisters from New Zealand  &amp;  Sydney. So we are 40 nurses altogether. After the nurses were all on board the boat went back to wharf  &amp; brought over about 500 soldiers  &amp; they all were very happy &amp; lively. It was very exciting, cheering, singing &amp; waving of flags. The Cove was very gay with rowing</p>
