narrow but very clean, there are some fine business streets and shops there most of the shops are 5 storey high and well built, her streets at the present time are very gay with the military uniforms for the French have a very showy dress a nice blue with plenty of gold braid and red stripes and all French soldiers unlike the English wear their medals on their breast and they look alright, our kakhi uniform looks very commonplace against the blue of the French, but it has the pull over the French in the field
There are fine big shops who cater solely for the British in the matter of clothing and they have a very fine show of goods in their windows and show cases
