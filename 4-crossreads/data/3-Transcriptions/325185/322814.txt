<p>Hindcott<br/>Wilts England<br/>17.12.17</p>
<p>Dear Father<br/>Have had about half a dozen letters from you just lately. Letters that have been accumulating while in Hsptl. Well have had my furlough had a very fine time needless to say. Spent part of my time in London then went to Cambridge to the Titteringtons. Had about four days with them. I wrote and told you they had sent word I was to consider their <strike>home</strike> place as my home while in England. Had a very nice time there. Harry was in London also his wife. She is a very nice girl very bright &amp; lively. I stayed the last few days of my leave with them. We did the rounds of the theatres etc. Was very sorry when my time was up. I didn't go to the Bank until the day before my leave was up. Found when I got there the money was there for me. I had enough to carry me through without it so dident touch it. Will do for another time. If I get across wounded or I may get Paris leave shortly after I get back to the Batt. Have transferred &pound;10 to my pay book so I shall be sure of getting the leave when my time comes around again. That wont be</p>
