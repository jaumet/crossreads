Sat. Mar. 24. Jack Kitson resigned from "the Nightbirds".

Sun. Mar. 25. Final rehearsal. Things going good. Fritz still going back. I wish he would go right back to Germany so that we could get back Home.

Mon. Mar. 26. Major McKenzie discharged about 50 Patients yesterday, but we are nearly full up again. The Concert came off & was pretty good, but not so good as the show we put on in Albert & Meault. Norm Adams made us some new ruffles which looked very well indeed. Nick Coxon appeared as Melba & did very well. Heard today that the Bapaume Town Hall had blown up & caught some of the Comforts Fund people who were arranging for a Concert to be held there. [A mine laid by the retreating Germans]
