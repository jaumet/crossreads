  
 doubtless the one you posted it was very nice too but I am sorry they are still sending mufflers etc. which at this time of the year are useless to us, socks of course come in at any time but it is a shame with the other stuff as we really cant carry them & cant give them away.  Oh well I will have to say Au Revoir as I am due to go out & get a feed.  Give my love & kisses to all & whips for yourself.
