 Rolleston 28.11.16 Dear father, 
 We received news the other day, of some frightful casualties in the 5th Brigade.  They were evidently shelled in their billets.  Poor old Duffy was killed instantly by a shell falling in his tent.  The first of the Cyclist officers to go out &amp; the best of them.  We were great pals &amp; the news has hit me very hard. 
 I had a letter from Evan Richards about three weeks after his death.  He spoke of a little guide to Orderly Officers that we had been getting up together before the war, &amp; told me know much he had improved it.  Would you convey my sympathies to Mrs. Richards as I have not her address.  Evan was admired &amp; respected by all the Brigade Officers
