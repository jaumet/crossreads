8.4.16 SaturdayFeeling much better & have lost the violent Headache & feverishness.  I went on Parade this morning & carried out my usual duties.I have to attend a Court Martial in a day or so as prosecutor & witness on 2 men who rioted in the Camp a day or so past.  It is a duty which I do not like but unfortunately I cannot get out of it.I got a Canvass Sleeping Bag from one of the Drivers to-day & it will be just the thing when we are forced to camp under the wagons.I got a full report of our Divisions march across the Desert from one of our fellows who has come up from there.Of the suffering & agony they put up with few can realise it to its full extent.  They were marching from S. Tel-el-Kebir to Serapeum a distance of 39 miles & had it mapped out for a 3 days march.  15 miles 1st day, 9 - 2nd & 15 the third.At the beginning of the 3rd days march they were Strung out all over the place & nothing could move them from the torpor which they all seemed to be in.  Their water had given out the previous night
