Dear Mother Just a line to let you know that I am still doing well. My toe is a trifle sore yet and will be some weeks before it is well. I was operated on last Friday I had the nail taken right out so it will be some time before I will grow another nail.It is getting very cold over here now. It is not to bad over in this hospital it is under canvas it is the biggest hospital in the world under canvas.I might get a trip further out of it to Egypt or possibly to England Well I must close with love to all at homeYour loving SonW Reece xxxxx
