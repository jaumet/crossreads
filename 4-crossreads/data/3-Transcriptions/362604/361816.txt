<p>Boxing Day<br/>1918</p>
<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>I have been off duty since 10 a.m. this morning so I went out along the Beach in the glorious sunshine.  It has been almost as warm as a summer day.  I came back at 12 noon for dinner.  I went around to my Friend's Flat for a while &amp; then went out for a walk again.  I went around again for afternoon Tea &amp; met a "Coogee" Chap who knows some old Friends of mine.  He is a Newspaper reporter &amp; His Father has something to do with the Daily Telegraph.  He often goes to D.J's about their advertisements, a Mr. ..  We had a lovely Day yesterday, quite a Banquet.</p>
