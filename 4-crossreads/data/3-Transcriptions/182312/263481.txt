<p>Corporal back to Nos. 3 and 2 posts telling them to fire a few</p>
<p>rifle grenades over at the Boche and to rattle up the Lewis Guns</p>
<p>a bit so as to attract attention down that end whilst the strange</p>
<p>stretcher party got away.&nbsp; This worked well.&nbsp; Several times</p>
<p>they must have been sighted and fired on for we would suddenly</p>
<p>see them flatten out.&nbsp; This was done by the crawlers just</p>
<p>straightening themselves out flat allowing the inert man to roll</p>
<p>off into the snow.&nbsp; After a few minutes they would hoist him up</p>
<p>again and carry on.&nbsp; They got him safely down to the Dressing</p>
<p>Station and I heard afterwards that it wasn&#39;t a fit he had after</p>
<p>all but some rather serious affair.&nbsp; I don&#39;t suppose that lying</p>

<p>to it from No. 4 took us just on three quarters of an hour</p>
<p>although the journey was under 150 yards.&nbsp; The moon seemed to be</p>
<p>brighter that ever and the only way we could get along with safety</p>
<p>was to lie flat and wriggle along.&nbsp; The least attempt at crawling</p>
<p>brought the machine guns and snipers on to us causing hurried</p>
<p>scrambles into shell holes.&nbsp; Some of these shell holes had</p>
<p>recently been the landing place of other shells with the result</p>
<p>that the ice has smashed up but the water thus exposed had frozen</p>
<p>immediately cementing the whole together in such a manner as to</p>
<p>leave the jagged pieces of ice sticking up like almonds on top of</p>
<p>a cake.&nbsp; To have to suddenly dive in on top of this or even to</p>
<p>have to crawl through such shell holes is no pleasantry.</p>
