<p>"Goodbye Australia"<br/>S.S. Mongolia  July 9th  1916.<br/>I<br/>Thy bold outlines growing dimmer, in the sunset's golden glimmer<br/>Jutting headland, rocky slope and winding bay<br/>And the troops are gathered forward, with strained eyes gazing shoreward,<br/>Just to catch the last glimpse fading with the day.</p>
<p>2<br/>For a passionate devotion, strong and boundless as the ocean,<br/>For a Home of  Homelands, glorious and Free<br/>With a solemn strange insistence, as we swing out in the distance<br/>Thrills our hearts anew with sacred love to thee.</p>
<p>3<br/>All the tender ties that bind us. All the memories that remind us<br/>Of thy Shores, thy sun kissed lands, thy beauty rare<br/>Every golden recollection, stirring chords of deep affection<br/>Builds anew the heart's High Throne, and sets thee there.</p>
