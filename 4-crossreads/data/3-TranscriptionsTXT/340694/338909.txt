244 were from home, most of the others from unexpected sources. For breakfast I bought 1/2 lb steak & took it across the road to be cooked.
6/7/16Had a good fly round in a car to-day looking for a place that was hard to find. Called & had a yarn to Charlie Ferguson, gave me a tin of tobacco. Saw Eric this morning at the Coy & had a yarn.
There was a gas alarm last night at 1/2 past 12 but it didn't reach us. I had my helmet handy in case it was a dinkum alarm.
8/7/16Have had a couple of good spins in a car these last couple of days it was great. Saw Norm Janson yesterday had a great yarn.
