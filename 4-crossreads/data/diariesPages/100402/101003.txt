Car 230
Tuesday 1 January 1918
The new year entered with mirth and merriment in our hut to the swirl of pipes etc.
The ground is snow covered but the day is beautifully fine. We are now at Dranoutre, Belgium about two miles over the French border and about three miles from Ballieul in France. This morning much temporary sickness prevails among the troops as a result of excess of mirth etc. last night. Personally I am O.K. had only a glass of champagne last night. Living a quiet uneventful life round a field Hospital.
