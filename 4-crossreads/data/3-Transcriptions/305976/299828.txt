<p>Sections. Ambulance at present comprised 3 Sections A, B &amp; C. A Section N.S.W. B Section Vict C Section S.A &amp; Queenslanders. A. Section under S Major <strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </strike> (some bouncer) B Section Sgt <strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  </strike> (dapper little Englishman) C Section Sgt <strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strike> (lusty youth) who shut his eyes when giving commands &amp; trusted to providence to pull him through. The day was spent in squad drill with Lecture thrown in after Tea. S M informs us chaps from N.S.W that we need not think we could play up in Victoria if we were allowed to in N.S.W. He informed us in delightful language that they had a barb wire fence and he was not frightened to use it. A foolish remark for a man in his position to make.</p>
