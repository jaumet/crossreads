1915May. 9 Sun.Weather continuing very pleasant but flies very bad in the daytime.Church Service held at 2.15 p.m. out in the open air in front of the house.Our motor ambulances are in use every day & are proving extremely useful on the splendid roads round Cairo, but the long runs they have to do eats up a tremendous lot of petrol so that expense is pretty solid.
