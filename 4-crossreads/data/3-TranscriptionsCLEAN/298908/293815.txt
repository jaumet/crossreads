  
 hang on with till Horsferry Rd. opened which was not until 11 or thereabouts.  A bed was out of the question for the funds wouldn't stand it, so to put the time in till breakfast we had a hot bath & I shaved & cleaned my boots.  After these operations we went into the reading room & slept in an easy chair till 8 oclock.  We then spent the remainder of our wealth purchasing our breakfast.  This left us entirely broke & with not a bean in the world.  To kill time until the Pay office opened we went for a stroll up Holborn Way & up there I met Sampson one of our old Coy. officers, we had a good yarn about the Battn. & etc., & then Mac & I struck out for Oxford Street & then down to Victoria & arrived in due course at Horsferry Rd. where we were politely told that we could draw no money.  A pretty situation & one we were not going to accept lying down so Mac & I finds an officer & we put our case before
