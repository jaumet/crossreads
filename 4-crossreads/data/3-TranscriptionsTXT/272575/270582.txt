 1-9-18. Dear Mother Quite a packet of your letters have come along lately, also some from the girls, and you can imagine how surprised I was to receive a letter from Grace Lord a couple of weeks ago. I have not answered it yet, for I haven't had time, we have been busy part of the time, and when we were not at work I felt too tired for letter writing,   It is not because the work is so hard but it is the conditions, and constant going    The conditions could be very much worse   I'm glad they're not,   The weather has been with us right along.   Lately it was really been a sunny France.   I began to have my doubts about it, but the Sun does shine over here, sometimes,   The last two stunts have been rather good, but the papers will tell you all about them, I would very much like to know what fritz thinks about them.   just at present he is in a bad way
