<p>October 24</p>
<p>BELGIAN BATTERY CORNER YPRES<br/>82.<br/>Wind blown rain ends the ..I take Kitching's place, he staying back at the Devonshire lines with the Q.M.</p>
<p>There we're attached to the 2nd, on fatigue about our overflow post, and a dressing station for local woundings.</p>
<p>Twelve of us for the duties of [indecipherable].  Tomorrow on dressings, from 9 till 9.</p>
<p>This afternoon on the heaviest fatigues since Sept. 1894&hellip; carrying a long distance heavy logs and [indecipherable] iron for the building of new dugouts.</p>
<p>On the Kruisstraat met Jimmy Strange &ndash; he now a one star man:  the last I saw of Jimmy was at the dinner in St. James in Cairo.  He for a school for six weeks -  with weekend leave to Paris every second week.</p>
<p>Tonight I meet Costrane, his name I'm not certain of &ndash; or Casteril, I remember by associating, when I first heard it, the Prof. who translated the Iliad or wrote some commentary on it.  First I desired to know him, seeing him in a near tent at Liverpool&hellip;.</p>
<p>Of the Bearers, now Toby, Clarrie and Johnno are number 4's, all left of the old bearers of A Section.</p>
<p>October 25<br/>83.<br/>Writing, in the dressing room dugout, half dopey with chloroform, self inflicted.</p>
<p>The aidpost mostly for local sick parades, and dressings only of easy slight types.</p>
<p>One of the mornings earlier, a coloured man:  they are employed only where none of us have seen them, only when there is no witness about:  he with a slight shrapnell graze on his head:</p>
<p>"Didn't you have a tin hat on, lad?"<br/>"Oho, noh!"<br/>"How's that! hurt?"<br/>"Oho yes!"<br/>"A Blighty?"<br/>"Oho, noh!"</p>
<p>In their spoken English they can run miles from the average Tommy.. but Tommy certainly leans fondly towards local dialects.</p>
<p>Our world is a cupula iron dugout &ndash; about ten feet long: around us are old walls of a terrace, and a skeleton roof bravely rises over us. .. The light by candles and two old kerosene lamps:  most of the chaps through have been our own Artillery boys, and the Infantry of the 3rd Brigade.</p>
<p>This is my first experience of working with sick parades&hellip; it reccommends me towards a detail job in one of the Battalions.</p>
