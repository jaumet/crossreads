<p>Nothing but dry desert on one side as far as the eye can reach but on the other is fertile country (Nile irrigation scheme). We had a good view of the canal, travelling alongside for about 20 miles. About 7-30 pm we reached Zeitoun siding &amp; detrained. After a good deal of waiting &amp;  arguing we were marched off to Zeitoun camp about a mile away. Here were alotted tents &amp;  made the best of it in the dark &amp; of course we are in the desert &amp; sleep in the sand. After raiding the canteen for a meal  &amp;  getting mixed up with our money &amp;  Piastres (disasters) milieus etc we turned in. The natives are not very intelligent &amp;  the Indian soldiers show out to advantage. They drill &amp; bring their arms so smartly &amp;  smile when we cheer them. Zaqiziq is a very dirty city &amp; next</p>
