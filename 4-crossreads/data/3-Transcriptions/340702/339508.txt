<p>Sat 24.9.17 Had an exciting time putting up lighting mains yesterday. I had previously put up the poles. A Taube brought down on of our observation Baloons yesterday evening. We had a good view from the Mill. Lights out about every 10 minutes last night. Taubes very busy. The Searchlights caught a few. Our Boys Knocked back by Fritz yesterday evening.</p>
<p><u>Sunday</u>  I seen some of our planes carrying lights last night. The Taubes came over as usual. Our Archies were occasionally using an inflammable shell that looked like a meteor flashing through the air. This must be done  <strike>for</strike>  to enable a gunner to distinguish his own shells</p>
<p><u>Monday</u>   Went to Oudenard.  Found 3rd Battalion. Jack left them about a month ago with Trench fever. He is still in Hospital. On the way home I met Mrs Trazer's Brother 4th Batt. After that I had a look over the contour map of the English &amp; German trenches on this Sector. The Troops are shown over this before going into the line &amp; especially with reference to their own possy. The layout is about 80 sq yards. Everything is shown on it. It clearly shows that Fritz is abandoning the Trench System. All of his Pill Boxes &amp; Blockhouses are shown, even woods, swamps, guns, etc. A chap told me that these block houses would stand up to 9.2s. He said they were made of a new sort of cement soft fibry stuff about 6'to8' [feet] thick.<br/>Our artillery were wonderful</p>
