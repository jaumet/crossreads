  
 concert given by some of the hospital staff. 
 20th S. Hosp.  25.11.17 
 I went to a concert last night in the YMCA given by the M Gun Coy.  They had a very good orchestra and the items were rendered for the most part by professional actors.  The weather is very windy and cold.  I am sharing my ward with two very nice English chaps.
