<p>they are Indians I believe.  They wear Breech clouts, Ghee strings, Brass wire Ear rings, No Boots (Earings [sketch] 3 spirals)  They are Salvaging &amp; have a white Officer over them.  We told a Tommy the Officer was a German Spy this led to some amusing results.  The Officer of course had no Reg. Badges &amp; his Uniform was rather mixed too that Tommy thought that he could see a reward &amp; special leave sticking out a foot.</p>
<p>Wednesday [25-7]<br/>Our Breakfast come a Gutser this morning.  The Mess Orderlies came head over tip over a bank while carrying it (Porridge &amp; Tea) there was no Salvage.  Coming home drunk in the Evening Cpl Maffesoni slipped down the same bank &amp; brought home about umteen issues of Porridge Tea leaves etc on his uniform.  To get even he pulled all the Mess Orderlies out of Bed.  He then made a tour of the Hut trying to issue the porridge but the men who made an awfull row over missing their Breakfast would'nt accept it at any price.</p>
<p>Thursday<br/>We returned to Ligny-Thilloy this afternoon by a very round about route via Maricourt, renecourt, Combles, Le Transloy &amp; Bapaume.</p>
