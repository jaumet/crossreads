Sunday Aug 26. 1917. (1119.)A fine day.  We have another holiday this afternoon.  There was the usual inspection this morning just before dinner.  Lieut. Mapleson has returned to this Battalion, and will in all probability resume his duties as Transport officer much to the regret of a number of the men who prefer our present officer Mr Robinson.Three of the men here were sent away to divisional H.Q. this morning to act as Traffic control.  Bill Murdock, Tom Byrnes & - Lamb.I finished reading a very interesting Book "False Evidence" by the well known author E. P. Oppenheim.  It is a story of an officer who was cashiered & lost his commission on a charge of cowardice the evidance was false & the truth did not come out for 25 years when his half brother admitted it, & the officer again becomes a hero.[1 line of shorthand]8 pages.
Monday Aug. 27. 1917. (1120)It was wet last night & this morning.  I was on No. 3 picquet from 12 to 3.  It was windy with occasional showers & no moon.  It was a bad night for picquet duty.  There is occasional showers today and a strong wind from S.W.  The war news during the past month has been [indecipherable].  The "Express" today reports the Italians capture a great mountain fortress Monte Santo one of the outstanding bastions of the Austrians fortified line  The Austrians are in retreat hotly pursued, 23,000 prisoners and 75 guns are captured by the gallant Italians, who are showing tremendous courage and resourcefulness.  The battle is raging along the whole Italian front & in favour of the Italians.  233 aeroplanes were engaged in the struggle, & only one failed to return.
