Sunday Afternoon 1/9/17. our Football Team went down to Borre about 15 miles away to play a Team there, as I was on duty again at 4 Pm I could not go. They had a grand time, my Mate was with them told me that they had been beaten by 2 goals to Nil but still they did not mind as the Boys there gave them a good tea the Royal Engineers Band there gave them a Musical Treat as the Band had only been formed 3 weeks they gave a splendid account of themselves which was appreciated by all, our Boys left for home at 8 Pm after a lot of delays enroute they arrived home singing merrily in the Trucks at 10 Pm.
