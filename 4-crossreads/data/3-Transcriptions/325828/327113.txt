<p>No 7 squadron<br/>Australian Flying Corps,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 15.11.18<br/>Leighterton, Tetbury, Glos.<br/>Sunday Evg 22/9/18</p>
<p>My dearest father,<br/>Since I last wrote, no Australian mail has come in, but there are rumours afloat that a mail is due in to-morrow so perhaps I will hear then.  I hope that you are all keeping in the best of health at home; on my part I am keeping in splendid condition here, and am very happy in my work.<br/>The weather here has been very stormy <strike>here</strike> for some time past now; very strong Westerly winds, &amp; gusty too, &amp; rain at least twice a day.  On top of this, ground fogs drift in from the Bristol Channel, &amp; make things unpleasant as a rule.  The district is of a very clayey nature and in consequence of the continual rain, the ground is very slippery &amp; treacherous.  One of our mechanics starting up an engine a few days ago, slipped; the engine starting, caused the revolving prop. to catch his arm, breaking it instantly.  So very simply done too.<br/>I took up a new type of machine yesterday to the kind I generally fly.  I climbed to 4,000 &amp; tried my hand at some fancy flying- looping the loop, spinning, &amp; &frac12; rolls.</p>
