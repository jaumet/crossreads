MAY   WEDNESDAY 24   1916
A nice calm sunny day at last. I came out of hospital for good in morning. Capt Campbell told me to take it easy for a day or two. So lay in the sun all day & read & yarned. To day is Empire day - how different from last 24th May. Then I was lopping trees for stock all day at 4D. We had a concert at night and it was not to bad. Some real good songs sung very well & some good comic Recitations
