<p>April 5th 1917.</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. our relieving squad turned up, so our squad reported at Headquarters where we were on the 31st March. At 1 oclock all the Bearers started on the long march back to the old Dressing Station where we all lived when not Stretcher bearing last January. We proceeded along a different route, then what I cam along on the seventeenth of march. Past our old Posts where I was on the 29th to the 31st of January last.  It is no wonder that the shells flew around there thick &amp; fast, as from Fritz old trenches we could see the trench in which we were living. The ground around Fritz old trenches was just a mass of shell holes, it is no wonder he had to retire, it must have been hell for the enemy here. Without one word of a like there was hardly a foot space between the shell holes. Pass a number of dead Germans, the next post passed was the old number 4 (which I have mentioned on numerous occasions). The place was quite deserved, it seemed very strange. Arrived at our destination at 5 p.m. &amp; enjoyed a good tea. The place was much quieter than it was three weeks ago, it is hard to realise that barely a month ago this place as a scene of great activity alive with troops etc.</p>
