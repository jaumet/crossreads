There has been periodical dust storms all day although the weather has cooled somewhat.
Pay day.
I have just been having a read on "reckon up" of the pay book. the first one since I joined I have only been allowed to draw 3/5 per diem whilst out of Australia So I have been getting 3/5 per day from the 6th Dec 1914. I now make the startling discovery that I have overdrawn my account to the extent of 9.7.3! Of course there is still 5/1d per diem to my credit all that time The Government up to the 1st April owes me 114-12-6 and I have drawn 122.8.1. My deferred pay 2/- per diem from the 10th sept 1914; (The date I was promoted Sergeant) comes to 57.1.0.6    pay day today
15th April Sund Sat 1916
The usual routine all day
The weather sublime. No dust
I tasted Native made coffee tonight for the first time as I very rarely drink coffee but it was beautiful. It appears to me to have a different flavour to any I have ever tasted before. The Orient is as we all know, the place where the National drink is Coffee
