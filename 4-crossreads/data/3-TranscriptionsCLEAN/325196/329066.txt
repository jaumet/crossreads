  
 Having a good time on board here & are getting into warmer weather. Had a very decent Xmas dinner for soldiers; roast Beef & peas, soup & pudding & Meredith proved a sport & treated us to a dozen cases of wine (1 bottle to 4 men) A New Zealander died on board today from Meningitis  One would think by the amount of Crown & Anchor played on board that this boat was a "gaffing school" & they would not be far wrong;  Two torpedo boats came close up to us this morning apparently patrolling for submarines but have seen no sight of them since; Hot water baths are turned on for the troops & quite a treat they are to  us feeling a little squeamish tonight & am sleeping on deck
