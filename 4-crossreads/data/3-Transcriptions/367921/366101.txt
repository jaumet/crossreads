<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Our own English food was all gone by now so when the German food was served up, it went with a relish that was strange to German Diet. The food here was remarkably good being better than I had seen in any of the hospitals or camps I had been in, so that when we were moved off next day to Aix la Chapelle, Ifor one, was sorry to leave.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   However we were warned by our guards that they meant to kill if we attempted to escape, so as no chance offered itself on the way we arrived at Aachen in a few hours and were taken before the Commandant who sent us off to,a military gaol, where we found ourselves certainly up against it, for, as our fellow prisoners were all disciplinary cases from the German army in occupied France, the treatment was anything but gentle.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The building in pre-war days had been a technical school of arts and we were alloted to a schoolroom amongst a number of German soldiers and Russian prisoners who had been attempting to regain their liberty.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   In marching through the town we noticed that the shop windows were much better stocked than in any other town that we had been in, this was probably due to the goods being smuggled in through Holland.
