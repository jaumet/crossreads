<p>Australian &ndash; (one Australian equal to one Durbanite).<br/>Our perambulations necessarily cost us a few bob for the Boys, and I'm afraid those of us who happened to be in funds were guilty of the serious offence of paying 'over the card.' Its hard for an Australian to be mean with cash &ndash; even to a nig - &amp; the general opinion of the boys was that the ricksha boy is worth more than he earns as a hard laborer.  Also some of him &ndash; the speculative Zulu, Bechuana &amp; Matabele element, is a fine sport. They understand our idea of a joke, &amp;, if properly rewarded, willingly consent to such trifles as scaring tommies on foot &amp; racing madly in West St on the wrong side of the road. Also, for 6 pence, they will sell out &amp; change places with the fare &ndash; who always end by flinging in the towel and changing over again. Ricksha running is a poor stunt. I tried it.-    Some of the boys are well got up &ndash; mostly as devils from Darkest A. &ndash; with tremendous polished horns, small Rhino horns, porcupine quills, feathers of all kinds, mostly beautiful, rings, bangles, beads &amp; cows-tails. Travelling, the are absolutely silent-footed, but their bells jangle &amp; they imitate all the noises of the jungle as they run. If feeling fresh, they ring in fancy bits, shying at passers-by, high-jumping &amp; free-wheeling on the tail board with one foot swinging down to act as  break on the road way should a collision seem probable.</p>
