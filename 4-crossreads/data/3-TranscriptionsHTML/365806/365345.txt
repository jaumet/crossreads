<p>France<br/>30.11.16<br/>The Hon. Mr. Justice Ferguson<br/>Sydney.</p>
<p>Sydney</p>
<p>Permit me to offer yourself and family my deepest sympathy in the lass of your son Capt. A. S. Ferguson.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I had no opportunity of seeing him before I learnt of his untimely death so I was unable to tell him that I had travelled with you on the "Osterley".</p>
<p>I am sure that the circumstances under which he died will in some measure console you all.</p>
<p>With kind regards,<br/>I am yours sincerely<br/>M.C. Moors<br/>[indecipherable]</p>
