<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>Yesterday I despatched three portions of camuflaged diary to you &amp; trust the same will find you quicker than it left me.</p>
<p>Today the Mission visited Gaba Tepe from whence Jacko used to pound Anzac beach.  I managed to get a small painting of the stuff one sees of Anzac &amp; environs from Gaba Tepe.  The expeditions are nearing the end of their course and I think from now on I shall be able to concentrate on the necessary data for my picture or pictures.</p>
<p>Spruce is up and about but a bit Malarious.</p>
<p>Today I rode a one eyed cob or Welsh pony which has been tried &amp; found wanting by every other member of the outfit and I had a most enjoyable ride.  The little chap is a gentleman but fastidious and it is not boasting to say he performed like a show ring hack or saddle horse under my fatherly hand.</p>
