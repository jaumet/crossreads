 FRIDAY, JUNE 27, 1919. 
 Fine but very bleak &amp; cold. Peter 
 rode in on his bike &amp; fixed up with 
 Maunders about getting car in. 
 Edwards fixed up 4D mill. 
 Tickle drawing sand to the 
 Boundary troughs. I was round 
 the Mountain in morning &amp; 
 started stacking up that block 
 by black flat in Middle 
 Paddock.
