 April 1916 [Note in margin:] Friday 28th &ndash; Reveille at 3 am camels etc loaded &amp; after a snack of bully beef biscuits &amp; tea we got away about 5.15 am, this time one man to a camel. We also had saddles packed with our blankets etc therefore we were fairly comfortable altho mighty glad to get to our destination. An escort of NZ. M.R. accompanied us. The first part of journey &amp; nearly all the way out to Railhead  way  was good going. Camels walking fair pace. Country or desert was hard &amp; a kind of short salt bushy growth on it. In places we crossed the beds of dry lakes or swamps. Towards Railhead (15 m from Kantara) the desert got sandy &amp; heavier travelling. Had dinner (usual bully etc) at Railhead, stopping about an hour. Canterbury M.R. camped at Rlhd  Travellin  During morning, escort sighted 5 horsemen &amp; four of them set off full tilt to see who they were. Turned out to be the 5th L.H patrol [Note in margin:] Romani 28th &ndash; 5th L.H. being camped at Bir-el-Duidah. Passed several empty Bedouin camps or villages. They were built of palm leaves. Small Oasis' seemed fairly plentiful towards latter end of journey. Canterbury Lt lost his bearings &amp; got a little bushed. However we eventually landed at Romani which is between 30 &amp; 40 miles east from Kantara &amp; Quatia or Qatia several miles S.E. of us. We are about 5 m from sea &amp; Quatia about 7 m from sea. Large dry swamp 'tween Q &amp; sea. Water covered during wet season. Arrived at Romani 'tween 5.30 &amp; 6 pm. very glad to get off the camel. 29th &ndash; Roused at 4 A.M. to "Stand to Arms". Brought Anzac memories back again. After roll-call we set to work pitching hsptl tents etc. About 7.30 am British aeroplane flying very low passed over camp dropping a message. Lowest we have seen. Message acknowledged
