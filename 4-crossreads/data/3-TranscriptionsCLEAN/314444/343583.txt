 No.1879 - Private J. Joseph Garbutt - 23rd Field Artillery Brigade 
 Dear Sir, We send you the following copies of two letters which our Agents have sent to us, and which we thought you might like to see:- 
 1. "Garbutt was badly wounded at our second position. He was in a dug-out by himself, when a shell blew it in, and one of the cupolas came down on him. The fellows soon got him out, and we sent him away to the Clearing Station, but we heard he died of his wounds there. He was very game, a splendid fitter too, and will be a great loss to the Battery." Extract letter from;- Lieut. C. H. Rowan, 110 Howitzer Battery, A.F.F.A. dated 1.11/17. 
 London, 6.12.17. 
 2. "Gunner Garbutt died from severe wounds on 1.10.17. and was buried at Lijssenthoek Cemetery, Plot 20. No .C 6a.2.10.17. Officiating Chaplain Chaplain Captain Rev. Clark". Extract from letter from;- Officer-in-Command No.10 Casualty Clearing Station, 11.11.17. 
 London, 20.11.17 
 Yours faithfully, [Signed:] H M Stephen 
 E. E. Row, Esq, Commercial Bank of Sydney, Moss Vale.
