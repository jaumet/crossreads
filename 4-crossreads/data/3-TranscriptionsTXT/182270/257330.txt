 SATURDAY, JANUARY 18, 1919. 
 Fine. Went out to the Bank 
 with Kieth in the morning 
 &amp; had a walk round the city 
 All the crowd went to the Zoo 
 in the afternoon and I was 
 about the flat. Alan came 
 along later and went out 
 dancing. Kieth &amp; I fooled 
 round at night &amp; got to bed 
 fairly early.
