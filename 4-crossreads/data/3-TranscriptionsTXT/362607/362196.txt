 Dear Mother, This is the inside view of the same church, it is only 12 years old. In the alcove above the alter there are statues of Mary   &amp;  Jesus   &amp;  Joseph as you can see. It is decorated with flowers   &amp;  is really pretty. All the walls have Pictures painted on them. The entry of Mary, Joseph   &amp;   Jesus into Heliopolis is shown   &amp;   several other Bible Pictures. I will write a letter by this mail as well  Love from Harry
