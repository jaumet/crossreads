<p>Thursday, November, 1914<br/>Very hot day granted half holiday to do our washing, it was very funny to see the efforts of the men.</p>
<p>In the morning we sponged the horses over with disinfectant &amp; rubbed all superfluous hair off.</p>
<p>One of our horses died to-day of inflammation he has been sick ever since he came on board, it is the first we have lost, whilst the mortality on the other boats is very heavy.</p>
<p>Concert at night, successful turn out, I recited Taking his Chance, Gunga Din &amp; The Day.  A Mail boat the Osterly passed the fleet about 6 pm it must have been a great sight for the passengers.</p>
<p>Friday, November, 1914<br/>Terrificly hot day like a furnace down below amongst horses.  When I first commenced this diary I wrote that our duties were light.  My Opinion is now greatly changed as we are always doing something with the horses.</p>
<p>I have discovered the names of the escort as far as we know, of course we surmise there are others cruising further away, they are Cruisers, flagship Minator, Sydney, Melbourne, Pyramus &amp; Japanese Ibuki.</p>
<p>Organising a sports meeting to be held on Sunday.</p>
<p>Wrote a poem to my mother whilst lying in bed.</p>
