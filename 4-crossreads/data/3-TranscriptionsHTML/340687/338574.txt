<p>September, 1917. Thursday 27<br/>Fine day. Out on pontoons to Hell Fire Corner and walked out to left about 7 &frac12; miles where we started forming. Rumours of working till 1.30 and did very little work all day as some argument about direction of line. Some shells searching behind us but not too close.</p>
<p>Gen Lavinia passed by and got chased by shells. Bremmer and Kernot knocked us off at 12 and we came home riding on motor lorries cleaned up and at 7.30 was having a wash when I heard my leave pass had arrived and started to-morrow. I was annoyed as no warning whatever was given. Went down with Price to C.R.E. &amp; saw Hayward</p>
