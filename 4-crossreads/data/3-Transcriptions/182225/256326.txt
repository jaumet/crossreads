<p>Fine &amp; warm. Round town with Alan in morning &amp; got some tickets for the Palace theatre. Went to Auntie Florences&#39; for lunch &amp; came back &amp; met Pitt at the Goring and we went out to the Zoo. It was pretty slow. Pitt &amp; M<sup>r</sup>&nbsp;Porter his mate, stayed to tea at the Goring &nbsp;We went to &quot;Bric-a-Brac&quot; in evening with M<sup>rs</sup>&nbsp;Angus &amp; Auntie Florence &amp; on to the Savoy after for supper we went down to the dancing after. M<sup>rs</sup>&nbsp;Angus took Alan &amp; I riding in Rotten Row in the morning &amp; it was great to get on a decent nag again for a bit.</p>
