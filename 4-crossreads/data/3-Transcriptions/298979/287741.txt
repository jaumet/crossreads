<p>when drearily wending ones way along a line of slippery duck boards after going about four miles as on this front, the Soup Kitchen comes in sight &amp; the whole of the men "buck up" knowing they are sure to obtain a tinful of hot cocoa or soup, &amp; often a biscuit &amp; cigarette as well.</p>
<p>It is really wonderful what a heartening effect such a small thing as this, has on the spirits of the men.
