<p>40 tins of tabbacco, sweets, and tinned fruits, fish, and vegetables, When I say they are much appreciated I do not half express what I should like to say. These parcels addressed direct to the O/C Machine Gun Section, 1st LH Brigade are the only ones we rec. now since we have formed a separate unit and do not participate in the 1st LH parcels.<br/>I would be most thankful if you would let any friends of the men in the M.G.S know this, as doubtless they contribute to 1st LH parcels thinking their men participate in them.<br/>Again thanking you and wishing you every success.<br/>C W Harris</p>
