<p>207<br/>a very turbulent time in the line. We found however that we still had another fatigue trip to do.</p>
<p>About 10 pm we set out for the village of Moreuil and obtained instructions from the Engineers as regards their requirements in the line.</p>
<p>It proved to be coils of barbed wire &ndash; and large ones at that, together with iron spikes for putting it on. This proved to be a most nerve trying trip.</p>
<p>Even whilst we were waiting outside the wall of a house at Moreuil a shell landed quite close.  Setting out and then halting for a while a gun an 18 pounder was discharged right in our ears. It made me jump</p>
