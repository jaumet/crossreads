<p>Palace on the banks of the ancient River Nile gossip says was built by one of the Khevides for an English girl who came as a governess to an English family in Cairo.  Later it became a tourist hotel &amp; it was indeed a charming spot for our <strike>wounded</strike> menfolk to rest in &amp; recover from their wounds.  And it was when the men reached hospital &ndash; whether wounded or ill &ndash; that our main Red Cross work reached them.  The Military Authorities had their work cut out supplying men food &amp; munitions to the front.  Thus only for the women quietly but thoroughly working <strike>working</strike> at home, the Drs. &amp; nurses would have found it impossible to <supply care for</strike> administer to the wants of our men as they did.  For the Red Cross Society &amp; all those working for it supplied not only sheets &amp; blankets &amp; all kinds of bedding, but also tooth brushes &amp; soap, pyjamas &amp; shirts, books, fruit, motor rides, games, foods, lounge suits, slippers, hats, chairs</p>
