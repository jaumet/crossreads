<p>March 1915<br/>Friday 19th<br/>B &amp; C Squadrons marched out to the quarries 4 miles towards the citadel.  The 5th Regt was placed between us and the camp &amp; we had to get through them.  However there was some misunderstanding &amp; the scheme did not work properly.  Was feeling a bit off, have caught a cold somehow so didn't shun in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Saturday 20th<br/>The whole brigade turned out in full marching order &amp; were inspected by the Brigadier.</p>
<p>Sunday 21st<br/>Spent a quiet day in camp.  Couldn't go anywhere, as I was broke.  Edmundson came round &amp; we yarned most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Monday 22nd<br/>Usual mounted drill in the morning.  Scouting &amp; advance guard work.  Didn't go out in the afternoon.</p>
