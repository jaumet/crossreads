<p>Mrs Watson and Mrs Scott paid me a visit last Thursday. I had never met Mrs. Scott before. She is about the smallest person I have ever sen. I enjoyed their visit immensely they are both so amusing -<br/>Dr. Munro came this morning, he looks about 10 years younger than when I saw him last. He is working at Guy's Hospital.</p>
<p>The girls are coming up tomorrow. It is a lucky time for me their being in England just at this time.
