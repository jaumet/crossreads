Fri 19thWas hauled out at 5.30 this morning, & was on parade early; had a lot of galloping, but no running on foot; had a rather tame time & arrived back in camp soon after 3 oclock:
Idleboy was kicked coming in off parade last Monday & has been "off duty" ever since;  Had an argument with Sergeant Simeon for not looking after him to-night & had a good mind to report him,  Put in the evening writing to Jess & Trix.  were issued with a new pair of boots each to-day & are very well off for clothes of all descriptions now.
