  
 glad to have him back again for he apparently has had a particularly bad time with his wounds. He spoke of being marked P.U. but considered that after a good rest in Australia he could be fit for some duty again. Maybe he will be kept out there and given a home job (which he has certainly earned). I have been back up the line for some time but the knee still makes itself felt at times and if it does not get quite o.k. I shall have to give it a rest as nowadays with us is pretty strenuous. I suppose by now you are all experts in the art of driving a car and can have some enjoyable week-ends with it. That is an amusement still in store for me. I hope this will catch an early mail out, but of course we are all in the dark as to shipping between Australia and this side of the world. My affectionate regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy and yourself From yours Sincerely Whitfeld
