<p>all anxious to get away. I don't think it will be many days before we leave At all events if we do leave I will post you a card whenever a mail leaves the front.<br/>I believe Mac Donalds crowd have gone &amp; some are back I did not see him again after we arrived. I have only seen Ian, Wells once So I expect he has gone.<br/>We have not recieved the mail this week, but I expect I will recieve an answer to the first letter I posted to Aunt Florrie. She told me in her last letter that she had just recieved a letter from Arthur &amp; she said it was a splendid letter and she would post me a copy of it as soon as she knew I recieved her letters.<br/>They tell me if you get wounded, that after you are able to get about they grant you six months' holiday &amp; that you can go to England or Australia, so I think I will go to England as Aunt Florrie has asked me to stay there if I come to Eng</p>
