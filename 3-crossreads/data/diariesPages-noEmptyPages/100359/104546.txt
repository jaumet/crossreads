On Sanitary Police with Jimmy Woods last night Capt. Irving took a party out to Sphinx Post, to finish the Dressing Station. Under the able supervision of "Mr." Jackson they soon had it finished and the roof on. They made a splendid job of it (I don't think) during the night, while they were peacefully slumbering, a terrific crash was heard ----- the roof had fallen in. So next morning they had to turn to and rebuild it. They got back in camp just before dinner, being Thursday we had afternoon off.
Friday 12th 
Went about half a mile away from camp and put in pegs for 2 tents and built latrines, or rather started to do so when we got word to say that
36.
37 more patients had arrived, so we just had to return to camp and pitch another Tortoise tent there. A supply of Red X comforts came in so we had tinned salmon and condensed milk for dinner, also got some good cigarettes
