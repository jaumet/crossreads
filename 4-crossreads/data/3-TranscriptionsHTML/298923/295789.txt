<p>3 May 1918 Friday<br/>Took up an advanced line from <strike>C</strike> squadron &amp; as usual got shelled.  Sole coming off boot, minor troubles worry a man, such as former &amp; never washing for days etc.  I carried the Mutual Store Plum Pudding &amp; Salmon till today &amp; then 3 Officers enjoyed it, as no rations have reached us for several days.<br/>On Outpost all night while other Brigades marched in single file down a Bridle track.</p>
