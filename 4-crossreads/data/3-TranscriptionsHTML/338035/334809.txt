<p>in Andover this afternoon &ndash; weather permitting.<br/>During the morning we spent the time in the trenches doing first aid &amp; stretcher work which was quite interesting.  As the ground is very chalky we were like sticks of chalk when we left.<br/>After dinner we (Norm Farquhar, Gil McCaulay &amp; self) left our Camp and while waiting for a motor lorry we witnessed a very nasty accident to a "Tommy".  His horse bolted and getting off the road put its foot into a hole &amp; fell throwing the rider very heavily on to his back, shoulder &amp; head.<br/>We tied a bandage round him and one of our Ambulances soon had him to hospital (Fargo).  Ascertained later that he was suffering slight concussion, broken collar bone &amp; ribs also that horse broke its shoulder and was shot.<br/>Our lorry came along (Geo. Young &amp; Coy, Andover Army Contractors) and we were soon on our way.  Arrived Andover at 3.15 and had a look at town which was very busy place.<br/>Thence to Clatford Manor about 2 miles out and was surprised to meet three Imperial Officers there from <strike>Back</strike> Berkshire Regiment (Territorials).  My friends people soon made us at home and after tea we played tennis until 8 p.m. and then they gave us an excellent dinner.  Might say here that we were provided with flannels, shirts etc. for tennis.<br/>There were five young ladies</p>
