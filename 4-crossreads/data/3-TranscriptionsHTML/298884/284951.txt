<p>the dining saloon was Sister Caren the girl who nursed me in West Maitland hospital when I was 15 years of age. I met her again in a box at the Albert Hall on Empire Day last year. She is now on her way to Aussie with her pal Sister Goggin from W. Australia.</p>
<p>Both these girls have seen hard and continuous service in Egypt France and England.</p>
<p>We had a good talk &amp; I then had a good look round the Derbyshire. She is a 6000 ton boat of the Bibby Line. We have about 1700 men on board. They are fairly tightly packed. Food is pretty good so far although the arrangements for giving the food out to the men seem a little bit fut. The chief steward however informs me</p>
