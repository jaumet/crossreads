<p>Base Hosp. to see poor little Sister Bolton.  We heard she was very ill &amp; still in the hospital.  She was awfully good to me while I was ill, such a kind hearted girl.</p>
<p>Has Charlie left Vic. Yet?  I'm longing to know what has happened to the poor kiddy.  Give my love to his Mother &amp; father &amp; Marion tell them I will write soon.</p>
<p>Fondest love to you all &amp; thank you very much for the photos.</p>
<p>From<br/>your loving sister<br/>Edith.</p>
