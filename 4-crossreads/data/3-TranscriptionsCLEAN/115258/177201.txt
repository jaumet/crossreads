I am posting home another registered envelope of photos (33 prints) also two ordinary envelopes of post cards. I think you had better fumigate them when they arrive - they might have germs on them, having been in the ward here with me. Rostron is much better now I'm glad to say. last night the parcel of biscuits came, and the biscuits are scrumptious. I have some to one of the sisters and to a couple of the chaps here, and told them they came from my home, and now they all say they are going to come and call as soon as they get back to Aussie, to see if they can get some more biscuits like them! i reckon it's very rude and greedy of them, and told them so. They ought to want to come see me, not just for biscuits sake! i was also pleased to get the S.S. Journal the tin was wrapped in. It is the first paper I have received since leaving the Regt in Oct. You see the Port Office has not time to redirect papers, so they always go to the Unit they are addressed to, and if not claimed are given out buckseech there. Sister Davidson is now in this hospital. I have only spoken to her once. Being in isolation I'd be shot at dawn if I was caught going round to another ward, so it's not worth the risk too often,. I do hope you have had good rain. Love to Father & Hal & Fred & yourself.
Your loving son Robert C. Wilson
