<p>stick I was carrying. Well to sum everything up to the present.  I consider I have had just a real good time. I am seeing all there is to see and having a fair amount of fun also. Have the Citadel &amp; Egyptian Museam to go to the next week-end if we are here &amp; I am free. I would say I am going by myself I dare say one of these black brutes will have a place in the tram before I get through. Well things are going along very smooth in camp. We have been out for musketry today what we did in Australia isint recognised here at all have to go through the coarse again. Should any fair well they have to fall back for further instruction. I have done very well today got within five points of the possible at three ranges we fired from. It is a stiffer trial you get here too. Well I think this is all the news will write each week while we are here. Love &amp; best wishes to all.</p>
<p>Your sincere</p>
