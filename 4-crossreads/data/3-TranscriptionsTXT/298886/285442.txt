improvised nosebags out of chaff bags and so peace reigns once more. But when morning comes I shall waylay them when they come to the feed stack Then I will have revenge  I know they will only "pinch" them again at the first opportunity but such is the way things go here it all helps to make the spice of life.
3rd March   Friday 1916.
Went for a ride to Nazlet-El-Abid this morning took some message forms to the Signallers. I have filled in the forms for that Commission this morning and they have been handed in must await results now. I am not particularly anxious If I do get it it will mean cutting away from old associates and going amongst strangers. When the early morning patrol was going out about 5 AM this morning one of the men Pte Leatch had the misfortune to fall over the bridge which spans the canal close to Camp and was drowned. Up to a late hour tonight no trace of him has been found. althoughsomeone dived and brought his rifle to the surface. There is a very strong current at this place and it is surmised that his body has by this time gone some considerable distance down stream"C" Squadron are still awaiting orders.
