<p>Monday 6 May<br/>In a cricket match to-day "B" Section were badly beaten by "All-Comers".<br/>Fritz still shells these areas heavily in parts, Hazebrouck getting plenty as well as some gun positions on our left. Still civilians on this &amp; other farms hang on.</p>
<p>Tuesday 7 May<br/>Very wet this morning, but it was fine when we went into the line again to the same posts which we left.  Things are quiet on this front to-night but on the left, the artillery is very active. Caestre is quiet now. The wheat flour &amp; potatoes on the farms here are all being salved &amp; taken back.</p>
