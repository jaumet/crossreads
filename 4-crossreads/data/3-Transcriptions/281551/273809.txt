The first I saw was Allice Lewin, Lil Finigan &amp; Gladys Albert.  When I got inside I was met by Alma, Etta, Saidee, Wally Lewin &amp; Esme.  Outside the rest of my friends crowded around &amp; on the trip home we were all in one Taxi-Cab about 15 of us, every where they could possibly poke a flag out of the car they had one.  On arrival home the front of the house was hidden behing [behind] strings of flags of all sizes &amp; shapes, &amp; the house, ground, &amp; gardens was all cleaned &amp; polished up for the occasion.</p>

I spent my leave rather quietly, not going away at all &amp; not taking any of the consissions that the Railway department allowed me.  I had a free pass on all Government tramways during my leave.  The only time I went</p>
