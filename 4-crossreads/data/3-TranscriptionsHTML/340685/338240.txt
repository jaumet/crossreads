<p>got ready but were told we couldn't move until to-morrow or perhaps late in the afternoon or at night as the road had been blocked for some reason or other. Spent the morning writing this up and shivering. Very cold wind but many planes up and a heavy bombardment on. In the afternoon Nos 1 &amp; 2 sections got picks &amp; shovels and marched  out in the rain to fill in trenches and unload wagons. We set out at 1 and got back at 4. And after tea we soon got to bed at 6.30 and slept well all night.<br/>26.10.16 Very heavy <strike>by</strike> bombardment by our artillery on the left by the heavy guns. Got up about 7 and after breakfast waited about as there appears to be some work to do this morning on roads. However, <strike>at two</strike> we didn't work to-day so had a shave read some french and passed the rest of the day watching the big mail being sorted. I got a parcel from S.D. and a few letters. Early to bed and slept well.<br/>27.10.16 Up at 7 and after breakfast cleaned up a bit and at 8.30 went out with picks and shovels and dug drains round the huts the R.E.s are making. returned at 12 and after dinner went out again at 2 and got back about 4.30. Nos 3 &amp; 4 also went out. 7 letters waiting at dinner time. (Sep 5th). After tea went to bed and read french and the express and got to bed and slept warm although a bit intermittently. Must have had too much sleep lately.<br/>28.10.16 Up at 7 and wrote up diary and read letters before breakfast and off to work again at 8.30. No rain last night but a strong dry south wind. Worked on the drainings round the 69th R.E. huts and at 11.30 went down to Meaulte on a wagon and got some candles &amp; chocolates. In the afternoon did nothing but watch aeroplanes and in the evening went early to bed and read french and letters until 9.30.<br/>29.10.16 Slept cold. Raining again this morning and at 9 we went down to Meaulte on the pontoon wagon for a load of timber for our huts. Walked back having some coffee on the way and arrived at 1.30. Trying to work the afternoon off. No work all the afternoon. After tea got early to bed and read some more French to the usual accompaniment of row and song. Bed at 8. orders to move to-morrow at 8 o'clock. Some of the men seem rather unnerved and I'm wondering how they'll stand it.<br/>30.10.16 The S.M. came round at 6.15 and told us we were to move at 7.30 which gave us little time to have breakfast and get things mobile. However, I was soon ready and after breakfast helped to get the wagons loaded which was a long proceeding. We moved off about 8.15 after much rush the transport coming on later.</p>
