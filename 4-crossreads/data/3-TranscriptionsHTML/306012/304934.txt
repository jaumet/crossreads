<p>Mond. 5th Aug.<br/>The tent sub-division is still at the Ecole Primaire des Garcons.  There are only about a dozen of us here including one officer, a very decent chap.  The work is very light and consists of doing sick parades, clearing local &amp; Brigade sick &amp; supplying drugs.  While up at the A.D.S. I succeeded in salvaging a nice light French bike and am finding it very useful.  Every evening two of us bike down for a swim to the fine Amiens muncipal baths on the Somme where there is always a goodly collection of Australians.<br/>We are in the town of Amiens (St. Pierre Quarter) on the Route d'Albert.  The streets are practically deserted save for the heavy military traffic running to &amp; from the line.  There are numerous evidences of the boche's activity with his long range guns &ndash; whole houses having been demolished by shellfire and others flattened out with bombs.</p>
