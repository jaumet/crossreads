<p>"I don't care which way the damn show goes", says another, "as long as there is a finish to it somehow or other.  I do not care who goes out Tommie, Turk or Australian".</p>
<p>Turks being captured all carry 2 or 3 bombs each.  They evidently place a great deal of importance in this kind of warfare &amp; they make it one of the features of their trench fighting.</p>
<p>The Turks are fighting clean &amp; honourably &amp; it is evident from reports that they are soldiers of the highest discipline &amp; experience.  They are well fed, but ill clothed.</p>

<p>I have noticed lately the Turkish superiority at concealment, &amp; this is a standing reproof to the discipline of our own army.  The Turks are very seldom seen &amp; carry on their extensive, defensive operations with wonderful celerity &amp; quietness.</p>
<p>They are up to all the ruses under the sun.  Dancing towards our lines, approaching front trenches with hands raised above their heads &amp; then suddenly collecting together &amp; rushing trenches, dressing in our uniforms, etc.</p>
