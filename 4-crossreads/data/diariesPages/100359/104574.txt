Monday 10th
Had a good day's loaf, which we enjoyed to the full I had a bath, which was a great treat. Got up about 7 ad had a good feed of eggs. The rest of the day we spent writng letters and reading and playing cards, about 5, Capt. "Molly" came along and told us to get our tings ready to move off. We fell in at about 6. (39 men of B.Section) and after being issued with rations we moved off, to get our first taste of being under fire. Things are getting interesting now. While we were waiting for rations, a shell dropped quite near and made hole in the paddock. We went along the road in parties of 6 with an interval of about 200 yds. between each party, and 3 or 4 paces between each man. Serg. Hughes Roy Knowles, "Trenchy", "Billsy" May, Ted Sutton and I formed one party. We had gone along the road about a mile, when someone proposed a spell we had only just sat down and taken off our packs, when "plonk" came a shell just over the hedge alongside us. Leaves and mud scattered everywhere and so did we, quick and lively. This was our first taste of being "underfire" and it gave one a nasty taste in the mouth. We soon had our packs on again and went for our lives, and were very glad then we reached our Dressing Station. It was a Brewery at one time, but there's just about enough of it left to make a r3 roomed cottage, the rest of it lies scattered around the atmosphere. The Dressing Station is down in the cellar, which is very strongly built, and looks able to stand anything. We had no sooner arrived than 8 volunteers were called for to go out to the trenches. There was no trouble in getting ?em, as everyone wanted to go, we went out in 2 parties of 4 each, MacDougal, "Blue" Stanton, Trenchy and Deed, and Butler "Bricky" Howard, Hancock and myself. It is about 2 miles to the R.A.P. from our station, we took out a contrivance mounted on wheels to push our stretchers along on.
