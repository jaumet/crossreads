Monday 18 MarchLeft Vaudringhem on horseback with Chanc about 10.45 but at Nielles lez Blequin Page changed with Chanc. Arrived Lumbres good time had egg dinner & caught 1 pm train for St Omar with W/T chap. Trip very slow & delays long. At Arques changed on to ROD train which was passing us. Arrived just too late for leave train so caught another ROD train for Calais. Fairly fast trip this time, long walk to rest camp. Had tea, drew blankets etc and got to bed fairly late. Trip up extremely slow.
