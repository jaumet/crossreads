<p>We had a fine view of the famous Eddystone Lighthouse as we steamed into the harbour at Devonport.<br/>We were all overjoyed at the first sight of England. We disembarked immediately and entrained for Salisbury Plains. People cheered us all along the route and gave us tea and buns at the Stations. The country looked beautiful. The hedges instead of fences making it most picturesque. It is very cold here but our huts are all fitted up with stoves for heating and we can get plenty of coal fuel. The food is very good and we have hot water laid on to the showers. This is a very big military centre and huts stretch out on all sides. The aeroplane sheds are near here also and it is quite a common sight to see one hovering overhead. The Tommies we have seen look much smarter  than the Australians and are a good stamp of men physically.<br/>My chief friend on the trip over was Jack Warne. He is a very good natured chap who is never better pleased than when doing something for others. He is always making me tea and collaring dainties of which I always have half.</p>
