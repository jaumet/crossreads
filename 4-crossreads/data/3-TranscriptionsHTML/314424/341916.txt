<p>Continued from Book 9.<br/>Thursday March 7. 1918<br/>1312 day of the war.</p>
<p>I bought this book tonight at the U.C.A. tent in the village &ndash; Coulombes [Indecipherable].</p>
<p>I had a letter from my wife tonight written from Geelong dated Jan 4. 1918. No. 109. There is evidently a letter missing as there is no mention made of her trip or when she arrived. [A line of shorthand follows:  I wrote to my wife to night  letter 118 in green envelope]</p>
<p>Four of us, Bil Kieley, A. Johns, Ferguson myself are camped in a little room near our stables. We are paying 2 Francs a week for it. &amp; it has only an earthen floor, but it is better than sleeping in some of the billets &amp; we have a good fire tonight.</p>
<p>Friday March 8. 1918. 1313<br/>A fine day, frosty last night. I was doing a little Blacksmithing this evening.</p>
<p>I am on picquet tonight from 6 to 10 past 9. I had 5 stables to go round.</p>
<p>Saturday March 9. 1918. 1314<br/>A beautiful day, frosty last night.</p>
<p>I was again out drilling this morning from 9 to 11. First there was route march, then</p>
