My dear Judge,The last Australian mail - about a fortnight ago brought a letter from you written at Cooma while you were en route for Melbourne per car. And a few days later I received from England the January copy of Current History. Thank you very much for both.
I was down at Moascar attending an AMC officers school for two weeks, recently. I'm afraid I did not gain much knowledge but I managed to fill in the time well enough. Ismailia, about a mile from where we were camped is a very pretty place, on the canal, & boasting a French club, a couple of hotels, a Cinema show & very nice gardens. I was in there most evenings.
The 14th A.G.H. - the one Australian Gen. Hosp here now, has recently shifted from Cairo to Port Said and I went down there from Moascar for the week end. Port Said is the least attractive of any of the places I've been to in Egypt - about on a par with Suez or Aden. Theres nothing to see there & nowhere to go except for a sail which means going along the canal & back again - not at all exciting. Of course you can drive but the only way is along the Kantara Road which runs along
