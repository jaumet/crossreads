 An exciting incident occurred on the march home. I was riding in the rear when I noticed three horses down in front badly thrown by the ground signal wire. I galloped up thinking someone may be hurt and just as I reached there they cut the wire and I got caught myself, my horse plunged a lot but was soon free. The horse was badly gashed and the OC asked me would I stay behind and dress it. I did so and it was pretty late when I arrived at Heberta, did not sleep a wink.
