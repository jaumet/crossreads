 MAY 1917 
 1 TUESDAY 
 A perfect day. We packed 
 up &amp; left Brunembert 
 early &amp; camped at 
 Lonquenesse alongside 
 an aerodrome at night 
 I could find out no 
 news of Alan Although 
 I rang up the 60 squadron 
 they knew no further news. 
 I was on horse picket at 
 night. We slept under the 
 stars for the first time for nearly 
 a year.
