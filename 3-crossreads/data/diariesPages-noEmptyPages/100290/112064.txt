After 9.30 parade, Ridgway, Bob, Andy Carruthers self go for tour over old battleground. Visit Bazentin ? le Grand Petit. then over unspeakable roads to High Wood. The Herculean task of the horse transport to get along the tracks an army employed keeping them in some sort of order; Visit 2 disabled Tanks in High Wood. the much talked of Tanks ? rather disappointing when seen. H.M.S.L.S. Deelphine. Walk back against strong gale. Reg meets me in our dugout in deluge of rain. At last we come across each other, mutual delight. V great yarn. he looks well. Drive in transport in 8th Field in action in the line. We relieve them tomorrow.
