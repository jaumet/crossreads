<p>My dearest Mother   &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>Have received a bonza mail this morning, am feeling awfully excited, was told about noon, that I was to hold myself in readiness for transport to Aussie. It may mean a few days or a fortnight before we depart, Oh, to think I shall most likely see you all in a couple of months or less.</p>
<p>Eddy's letters are much improved, he will be an interesting boy now, not a little baby chap.</p>
<p>So sorry you cannot</p>
