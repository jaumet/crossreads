  
 Saturday 19 [18] May 1917 [1918] Day of "blues" very badly.  M.O. very kindly arranges motor drive with 2 sisters & tea at 21st G.H. but decide not to accept, instead go to tram terminus (17th G.H.) & then Bulkeley & the ocean.  2 good things for the day. 1st, walk up a quiet street with softly sighing pines making music on either side, then over a little sand hill, at the top the sea, sparkling & fresh as ever. Town 5.30 p.m. tea at Empire Nurses' Club then dress fitted at Shalons, 2 white ones, 2-5-0 each, bed 7.30 p.m. & very "blue".  M.O. says Bulkeley Tuesday.
