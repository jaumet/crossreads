  
 busy at Liverpool that he could not get in. We expect now to see him finally on Thurs. or Friday next, as he expects to be off very soon. The Rugby Union farewelled him on Saturday. 
 Although Olly was turned down at first, I believe he still hopes to go in some capacity, & there has been rather strong comment on  dentri  good dental aid not being sufficiently supplied. At the same time, as Dr. Magnus is definitely going to the Panama Exhibition I don't quite see how it will come off. Hilda Cliff is to be married next month in the Anglican Church 8 p.m. & we are invited, & to Lightcliff afterwards. There are sayings in muffled whispers that Dulcie is to be married before Roland goes, but - quien sabe? 
 Rollo is getting lovely now - not very rosy, except when he is excited, but he is jumping with life, & does not know how to expand his vigor. He does it largely by biffing Soogby cat whenever he gets within hitting distance, with or without cause, & he is as round & plump & hard as a young porker. We dont let him forget you, you may be sure.
