First day had to Report at Head Quarters   &  then do shopping. While at Head Quarters me Myra Wyse whose wedding we wanted to be over for   &  to our delight have been in time. She was so excited at meeting us, she   &  her sister who is over from France for the event, spent the day together. We had lunch to-gether, shopped   &  then dinner   &  to see "Romance", it is an awfully pretty little play   &  we thoroughly enjoyed it.
Next day did more shopping   &  fixed up Pay-book. From the 30th November I have made my allotment of 5/- per day, so you will be receiving double the amount after that date. I have plenty to go on with   &  am sure can manage very well on the remaining amount.
Wednesday-night spent from 12 till 3 a.m. in the basement. Wretched Air-raid.
