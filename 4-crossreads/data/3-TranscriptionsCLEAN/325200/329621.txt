The 2nd  &  3rd Bgdes are at Bir Salmana, they will attack at dawn tomorrow.By the way I think we have been a little too ambitious this time as we  - 12ltus Division - are attacking - as far as we know 2600 turks with 4 mountain batteries  &  10 machine guns, all of which are well entrenched  &  will take a deal of digging out unless we make a complete surprise; which is almost an impossibility for an enemy 'plane has been over two or three times this morning. I am afraid it will be a failure.We are supports  &  do not leave here
