  
 1916 Dec 25. following day. Christmas day, my first away from home.   Early in the morning we were given our Xmas present from the War Chest fund, a box containing Chewing gum, potted meat, cheese, lollies, a handkerchief, ginger, and a tin containing fifty cigarettes and tobacco.   I swopped the "bacca" for some cigarettes.   We had early communion and a service at 10 am.   Tom McCann who belonged to the Church of Christ used to come regularly to the C of E services and also to Communion.   All the fellows were wondering how their parents and friends were having their Xmas.   There were ham and eggs for breakfast.  At dinner time some of the men started raking over their plum pudding in the vain hope of finding threepences in it, but without success.   The plum pudding was of the usual rubber breed.   Extensive experiments with Ship's plum pudding have proved that.
