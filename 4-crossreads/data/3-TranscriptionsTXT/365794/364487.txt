 Tuesday 27 March 1917 [26 March 1918] Miss Wright V.A.D. &amp; I give a whist drive to the pts. 16 in ward &amp; some outsiders to make up the sets, 9 tables altogether.  Town 11 a.m. &amp; cakes bought.  For the 1st time I notice an act of rudeness on the part of a well dressed "Gyppo" youth in Groppi's.  While taking our coffee I glanced round &amp; he immediately lifted his glass &amp; drank to me, the action was nothing to the impertinent smile which accompanied it.  Now I wonder if there is anything in the rumor that these people would love to rise &amp; are just waiting to see the result on the Western front where the biggest battle of the war is raging.  If they did rise, heaven help the women in Cairo!! Whist drive a decided success, only in the middle an order comes for "all lights to be shaded", finish in semi-darkness.
