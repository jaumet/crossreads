<p>Tuesday 11 July 1916<br/>A very pleasant night &amp; I got a very fair sleep missing most of the scenery. At 6 o'clock started to take an interest in things &amp; found that we were passing thro' fairly undulating country in which the cultivated fields alternated with wooded uplands. The poppies &amp; field flowers looked very bright &amp; gay. Passed through Doullens &amp; about 7 detrained at Feinvilliers-Chandas, &amp; after waiting for the transportn. to be ready, started to move out thro' the township &amp; past fields most gaily coloured with poppies, cornflowers, mustard, "pin-cushions" &amp;c. Crops of crimson clover were quite common &amp; looked splendid.<br/>The undulating country thro' which the road passed was a change to the extremely level plains we had become accustomed to further north, &amp; some very pretty peeps of villages nesting in hollows with hills sloping down to them on all sides, or in a densely wooded valley along which a little stream found its way were had.<br/>Stopped at 9 for breakfast, &amp; soon after midday reached our destination, Domart. The billets were very poor &amp; took a lot of fixing up for the men : we were fairly comfortable, &amp; in the afternoon I had a lovely bath in a washbasin. Turned in early &amp; had a great sleep. Leo came in for a few minutes as we were about to have tea. Nelson Slee joined up.</p>
