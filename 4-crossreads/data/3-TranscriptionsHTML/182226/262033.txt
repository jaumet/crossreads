<p>Tuesday 11 January, 1916</p>
<p>Were towed up the harbour to 28 wharf, the Tommies got off in the morning but we had to wait till afternoon.</p>
<p>Were taken to &quot;A&quot; Camp Gabbari at Alexandria, our officers left us standing &amp; went off. We had neither food nor bedding, we managed to get something to eat off&nbsp;some kind hearted Tommies &amp; had us put on as many pieces of extra clothing as we could to bunk amongst some horse fodder in the Veterinary store. We were pretty cold &amp; uncomfortable.</p>
