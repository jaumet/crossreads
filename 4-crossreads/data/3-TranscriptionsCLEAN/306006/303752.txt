  
 26-2-17 we had buzzer practise this afternoon & the men who failed this morning in the test were taken out & given another chance; As soon as we were dismissed from the 4 oclock parade I made for Heliopolis bought a new cap & tunic had dinner & a shave & went to Abbassia; Met Hills at the sisters ward & went across with her to the Hospital as she is on night duty & came back with Jessie. Met Sister Parson & a lad from the camel corps & the 4 of us came for a walk to Zietoun & back; It was 10.30 before I arrived in Camp & managed to find my own hut without much difficulty; I have had a slight touch of rheumatism in the foot again today.
