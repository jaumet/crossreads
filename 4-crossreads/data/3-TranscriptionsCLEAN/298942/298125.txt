  
 Planes over in evening but I was asleep before he dropped his bombs thank goodness.  None near us. 
 Route march & issue of socks this morning. 
 Afternoon sentries inspection, then I had a bath in the pond & cleaned up generally, preparation to writing a few letters. 
 Noticed Guards drilling near here while on the march this morning. 
 Believe Madame Machine Gun is in Honinghen. 
 No news of Madame Van [indecipherable].
