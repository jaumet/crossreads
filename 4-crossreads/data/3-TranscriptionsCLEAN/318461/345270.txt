  
 another posi / otherwise - had to leave this owing to the constant warning of gas & not daring to go to sleep so joined some other fellows in another part of the ruined house & there I sat on the floor all night expecting every second to be blown to atoms but altho they came alongside of us, at us & round us none hit us after the one that got my two chums till daylight when feeling cramped I got up & walked into the next room had just got into it when a shell came into the room where I had been, walked out of this room & the same thing happened a shell came into the room I had just left amongst a lot of men wounding some I then went out to the place when I had taken my things to to see if it had been blown down & no sooner got there when another shell came through at the corner, that was enough 
 I went for an early morning stroll up the road away from the shells & after getting my nerves a bit steady made to come back when crossing what was once a railway line a whiz Bang just missed my head by ducking & landed about 10 yards away. Some of the boys say I am not born to be killed by shells & there is no get away from it, I am lucky, & never thanked God for life so fervently. There seems some guiding force behind me when danger is near at all events so it seems to me. 
 Am now in charge of the Police & have just had a sweet job looking for some men. saw several wounded whilst doing it
