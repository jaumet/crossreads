<p>1918<br/>27 Aug<br/>tried to get his report through to B Coy, but a shell broke the line. I went out (it was my turn) to mend it. Bill Collins was out laying another line. It ran along a trench for a few yards, then across the open in full view of Fritz for about 100 yards. As bad luck would have it, it was broken out there. I hopped out of the trench and ran like mad trailing the wire between my fingers. When I felt the break, I dropped down flat, crawled on my tummy to the other broken bit, mended it and then up again and over a bank by the side of a road. The ground fell away here, so I was safe as far as rifle fire went. The second break was also in the open. Mended that. The third break was in a trench. I had a dead Scotty and a dead Aussie, both about 3 days gone, for company. They were nearly black and very much blown up. Someone had got away with the Scotty's kilt leaving him half naked. Fixed this break up and met B Coy Sig. Corporal coming from his end. I just started back walking</p>
