<p>October 1918.<br/>Tuesday 8</p>
<p>With the 3rd Bttn Hdqrs.<br/>Joined up the above crowd of Yanks last night.<br/>Moved from Hdqs Ramicourt to a new one in Monteberain. Ran into Fritz barrage in the above village.<br/>At 5.10 am our barrage crashed out, I got caught again in barrage.<br/>Weather held good throughout. Proceeded to Brancourt and established a new hdqrs there. Had a hell of time, one never to be forgotten. Ran rations and wounded for some time, very sad scene in a house in this village.</p>
