<p>April Tuesday 17 1917</p>
<p>Heavy rain last night, also continuance of heavy bombardments. Duties as usual.<br/>A very cold raw windy day. When will the weather take up?  Here we are in the middle of April &amp; tis as cold &amp; wet as at Xmas.  Sunny France  --- where is it? Its the sorriest, dreariest place in the universe just now at any rate here at the front.</p>
