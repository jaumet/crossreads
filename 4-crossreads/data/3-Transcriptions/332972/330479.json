When in the big Cell, the former Provost Marshall Bardsly in company of several Police entered, picked him out  &amp;  ordered this Intenee to be remoived into a isolation cell,  &amp;  teached bad language. He had hardly entered the Cell when four Military Police sett upon him  &amp;  handled him roughly using their fists  &amp;  Boots on this unfortunate Internee untill he couldn't move The calling for mercy  &amp;  asistance  wher heard by all the other inmates of the lockup, wich however wher helpless. They dealt it out to him untill he wher senseless, they left him laying on the bar ground  &amp;  locked the door  &amp;  went away. The next morning he wher returned into the big cell, shewing marks all over his body.

Some Internees wher lucky to recieve some hessian bags &ndash; wich they could sew into a Palias. I asked for an exchange of 2 blankets, however wher informed by the Soldier in the store, that their wher none their.  When I explained to him that as the nights wher very cold this blankets being allmost tread bare  &amp;  full of holes on account of 4 years constant use, they wher insufficient to keep me warm. The Soldier pitied me  &amp;  advised me, to pinch one of my fellow Internees</p>
