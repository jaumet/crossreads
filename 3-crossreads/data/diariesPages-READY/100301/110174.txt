about this time I had been acting as Corporal of the guard and nothing unusual occured until 10-45 pm when the guard was called out by one of the officers who came along revolver in Hand, we turned out with our rifles fixed Bayonets marched towards where the Police stopped we came across a party in the road of three of the Police with 3 officers in Front of them pointing revolvers at them there was a sack in front of one of the police, I was called on to search the prisoners for arms, I found one revolver cartridges on one of them I was told to march them to the Guard tent, they were full the noo of Champagne which they had stolen from a store they had a sack half full of bottles of Fiz we went searched their quarters found some more hidden in all sorts of places. needless to say we did not give it all up in fact one of the guard got quite shickered had to say he had malaria which excuse got him off a serious charge such as drunk on Guard
