<p>Brigadier delivered a good speech.</p>
<p>Friday 14th [May]<br/>Was on pumping fatigue all day.  Got the niggers to do the work while I wrote letters.  Most of the troop went to Cairo.  I stayed on Maadi &amp; didn't get past the Nite  Cafe.  Most of the lads got inebriated &amp; got home at all hours of the morning.</p>
<p>Saturday 15th<br/>We were kept fairly busy most of the morning getting ready &amp; fixing up our kits.  Water was turned off most of the day, so also was the canteen, so we put in a very dry day.  We marched out of camp at 8oclock &amp; got a special train at Maadi.  We had a great march through Cairo, amid wild whoops, yells, etc.  The train for Alexandria was very crowded so we didn't get much sleep during the night.</p>
