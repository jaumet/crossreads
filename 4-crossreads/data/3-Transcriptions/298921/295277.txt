<p>November, 1915<br/><u>3 Nov.15</u><br/>From my Dugout I can see the War ships manoeuvreing &amp; firing &ndash; aeroplanes both friendly &amp; German in the air with little puffs of smoke shewing the shrapnel bursting around &amp; the men below, digging or cooking taking everything as a matter of course &amp; quite happy &ndash;<br/>We wish you all a Merry Christmas &amp; hope to be with you all again ere another comes round.<br/>Cup day &ndash; We have a sweep by Nos not knowing the names of the horses.</p>
