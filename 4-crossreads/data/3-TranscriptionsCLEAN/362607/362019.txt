  
 Bulford 24.2.18 Dear George, I have no news I'm only sending a P.C. to let you know that we are O.K. I went to a Dance dinner this week in the camp it was jolly-oh. The W.A.A. C.'S gave it to the Australians. We are giving them a return blow night on the 11th inst. I hope. I went to Sarum by train yesterday but I returned at 7 P.M. I met George Greer who used to have the shop next door to Buntings & also Flossie Gibbons both of whom I played Soldiers with in the old & Company O.M.R.R. It has been showery today but I went out for a nice walk alone & watched the Tommies at Soccer. We have had lovely mild weather. All the trees are in bud & snowdrops & all early spring flowers are blooming beautifully. I have 17 letters to write to-night so I must get on George. Regards to all the Boys & especially Os. Merrett & Mr Love & Give Kind Regards to all the Miles Family & Lily & Ken & Mum. Your Loving Brother  Harry
