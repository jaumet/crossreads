<p>Dear Mrs Jack,</p>
<p>Just a few lines to let you know I received your letter written on the Mataram on the way back &amp; was most pleased.  It had seemed just ages since I had heard from you &amp; I was most depressed.  So glad you had such a good time, it sounded lovely.  I read out the bits about marble pillared halls opened to the sky, with palms &amp;c. &amp; everybody dressed in white &amp; just nicely cool to the fellows:  and barely escaped with my life.  With the thermometer at <u>22</u> (Fahrenheit), snow all round &amp; ice everywhere inside &amp; out it was too cruel.  It has been terribly cold, we didn't realise till now how cold it could be, most of us.  But barring colds &amp; coughs we are all pretty well.  I have been terribly busy lately &amp; have been away from the Brigade a good deal.  I am taking over a new job, still attached to the old Brigade but it is different work, more responsible &amp; more independent but less</p>
