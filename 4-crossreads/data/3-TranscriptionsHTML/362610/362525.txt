<p>Sunday 5 Nov. 1916<br/>A minor operation on our front was attempted just after midnight last night, the artillery fire from neighbouring batteries being very heavy. Our attack was held up, our losses totalling abt. 150 all told. The morning was showery, then the sky cleared &amp; a cold nipping wind sprang up : about the coldest day we have yet had. The General did not go up the line in the morning but in the afternoon I went with the Brigade Major up to the two Bn. H.Q.s just missing a shelling. A heavy barrage &amp; an attack by the 2nd. Aust. Div. on our far left took place during the morning.</p>
