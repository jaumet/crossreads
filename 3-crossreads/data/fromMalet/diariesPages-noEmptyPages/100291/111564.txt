April Tuesday 17 1917
Heavy rain last night, also continuance of heavy bombardments. Duties as usual.
A very cold raw windy day. When will the weather take up? Here we are in the middle of April tis as cold wet as at Xmas. Sunny France --- where is it? Its the sorriest, dreariest place in the universe just now at any rate here at the front.
