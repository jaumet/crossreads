<p>22nd. Paraded with the Tasmanians yesterday as I belong to them now.</p>
<p>Another glorious morning &amp; scarce a cloud in the sky, the sea is very much quieter too, only an occasional big roller spins us about we sighted a lighthouse just after breakfast on the "port" side they say it is close to Portland.</p>
<p>Tons of fun at breakfast table this morning &amp; bites were plentiful you only have to throw out some little disparaging remark about Victoria to start things moving, &amp; next table to us is a "Tassy" he is one of the best bites on the ship, it's the fun of the world sometimes to listen to them, Victorians &amp; Tasmanians they throw off at one another &amp; N.S.W. &amp; Victorians are deadly enemies as far as the State is concerned, "Sydney Harbour"</p>
