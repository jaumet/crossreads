After a Chat for an half an hour I left & took a walk through the Shunting Yards, through Les Fontinettes & followed the main line right around to Calais Ville so as to get a good insight to all the Signals & points enroute, then back home again at the usual time. I continued going backwards & forwards until Friday 19th when on Saturday I broke my journey at Audruicq & paid by chum a visit & had Dinner with him & spent the Afternoon visiting friends in the Camp & after Tea my chum took me for a stroll out to visit some French People about 11/2 miles away, after a chat with his friends we went along a Canal to the Locks where a large number of Barges were being brought down containing Wounded Horses, at these locks the Barges are lowerd down about 4 ft, before the Gates of the lock are opened a slide at the bottom is drawn up & the Water rushes in & fills the Basin up to the level of the Water behind & then the Gates are opened & in goes a Barge drawn by two Horses when the Gates are closed & are opened at the other
