Fine. I went up to the battery
with a working party all day
& was moving amunition
all day. Old Fritz sent a few
over & we sent about ten
times the number back. I
walked home in evening.
I heard the big stunt was
starting a week from today
& is to be the biggest of the war
& there is to be 9000 guns under
the one G.O.C. The Tommies are
going over first then 4th Div
then 3rd Div. That is the
roumer & lets see how true
it comes out.
