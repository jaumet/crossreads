<p>My diary from 17th Oct 1915</p>
<p>Sunday 17 &ndash; Anzac 1st A.L.H.<br/>C. P. by Capt Green, fine attendance, day bleak &amp; wet.  Furious naval bombardment at The Narrows judging by report of big guns.  Wrote home to Mother and enclosed poem.  St Luke's day, on which Chaplain prays for Drs &amp; med orderlies.</p>
<p>Monday 18 Feeling a bit off indigestion  had a good rest during the day.  Good news from France &amp; Russia but ominous concerning the Balkans.  This is the period that the Turks have for a four days religious feast and we are fearing an attack so the trenches are doubly manned batmen sanitary &amp; cooks all go in to make up extra strength.</p>
<p>Tuesday 19  Last night the 3rd L.H. Regs patrol was due home at 2.30 am but had not put an appearance in up till 10 am an officer and a man went out to look for them fearing they had been ambushed.   The man returned wounded in the neck &amp; the officer is still missing.  The patrol was found later, they had been lost and nearly ambushed.   Sir Ian Hamilton is leaving this Force, being succeeded by Sir C C Munro.  He has written a fine thanking farewell to all men serving under him.  <br/>Rec mail today dated 7th Sept including parcels &amp; papers but more letters to come.  One of my parcels contained a Balaclava a welcome gift.</p>
