<p>2 January, 1916<br/>"Caledonia" got into Alex on Sunday &amp; disembarked on Monday morning &amp; entrained right away for Heliopolis. I put in two days at this camp then came back to Maadi &amp; joined up with my Regt I got back into my old A troop again.  Received a bundle of 29 letters &amp; a parcel from Bill [Fender?] &amp; found my kit bag &amp; it was fairly intact containing my two pairs of boots &amp; a pair of leggings. The boys have been drinking up well &amp; are making up for the time spent on the peninsular -  It is not bad to have a free [leg?] for a while.</p>
