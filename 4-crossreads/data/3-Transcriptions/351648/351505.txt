<p>We gave the men a "Bean-o" last night &amp; they had a great time, it was originally intended to celebrate the formation of the Unit in <strike>February</strike> Jan. but the day of the feast we had orders to move &amp; have not been together again till now.  Every one had an "ample sufficiency" in the way of tucker &amp; 2 barrels of Beer (French stuff only though &amp; a bit washy) allowed them to become jovial &amp; tolerant for the Concert that came afterwards which turned out to be excellent &amp; very thoroughly appreciated.  The Officers had their own "blow out" &amp; whether it was the Lobster or the wine, something must have been wrong for we are all "upset" today, perhaps it was the rich food?  No! no one got potted.  Have been to Amiens 2ce since coming out of the line, one can get an excellent feed there, &amp; as there are some</p>
