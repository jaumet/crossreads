<p>1916 July 22<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Rumour that a big push is to take place tonight orders are that we are not to leave billets on any acc. <br/>12 midnight. Are standing by ready to go out in motors to trenches. Hope to do my duty as one should. Wounded beginning to come in,  We go out in last car &amp; arrive Albert at dawn. Ruined town. Taken farther out per motor &amp; then walk into battlefield. Such a scene of desolation. Set to work stretcher bearing at once. Heart shaking bombardment, horrible sights. War in all its hideousness. "Casualty" corner. Stack's Poat . Carrying backwards &amp; forwards. The horror of those first few hours. such a revelation.</p>
