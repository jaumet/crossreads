we passed over a month ago. It is a network of roads and railways. Comfortable camps have rose like mushrooms; generally, the work done is incredable. "Gentle Annie"; the gun on the railway found a mark this evening and fired several shots.

Have shovelled enormous quantities of gravel lately. I really beleive that the
regulation army shovel is winning the war. Was paid 20 Fr this evening, a very popular event. Will seek diversion; there is a train going out from Willow Siding presently; and I will be aboard and ride out to Dermacourt.
