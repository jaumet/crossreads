I have met Tom Welch & P. Davis several times now & missed seeing C. Lewington last night by about ten minutes. I was in that stunt the other day in which we captured that village but was lucky enough again to come out with a whole skin. We were kept working pretty hard for about 24 hours. I sent you a card about a fortnight ago for your birthday. I could not get a decent one, in fact the one I sent I found in one of the deserted villages so it will be a souvenier as well. Am glad to hear Aunt Flo is looking so well I haven't heard from her now for over a month. Do not know whether you will understand this scribble but I am writing in a dugout hardly big enough to sit up in. We are having real summer
