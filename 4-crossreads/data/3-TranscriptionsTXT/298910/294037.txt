quite a lot who had managed to scramble in with broken arms, legs, etc. Then there was another phase to interest us to get the wounded off no mans land - last night a dozen volunteers went over & got 8 cases - but the Snipers made it too hot so we had to give it up - All day today we can see on to mans land by periscope at least 5 cases of wounded trying to move to give us a signal they are still alive, for these poor devils we are volunteering to go to night & do our utmost - During today we got three fellows by rope etc - first we throw them a water bottle & then drag them in - My mate Harry Ramsden this evening stood up on the parapet & looked over - just below him was a huge shell hole & a fellow partly buried, in answer he said he was unhurt, we soon got him over. Also got Cpl Jacobs 32nd shot in the breast, a brave lad too. On Wednesday evening at 6 pm
