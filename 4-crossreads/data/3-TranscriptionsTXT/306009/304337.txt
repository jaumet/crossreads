Fagging away at Arabic &ndash; know several words &amp; can count up to 20 &ndash; Will try speaking it first, &amp; reading &amp; writing (which are much harder) later, if possible. 100 wounded were suddenly jerked in on us at 7.30 p.m. &amp; with them returned 3 of our own men who have been away 2 months doing A.M.C. work on troopships &amp; at Lemnos, Enos &amp; Gallipoli Peninsula. They are looking fit &amp; have plenty to say concerning their adventures, having been under fire.
