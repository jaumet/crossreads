<p>Friday, 14th May, 1915<br/>All lights were extinguished last night as they are in dread of a submarine that is about.  Destroyers are hunting everywhere but she cannot be located.  There was a terrific battle during the night on the big hill [indecipherable] a big victory for us or a serious reverse.  The battleships were firing right on to the beach so we do not know the reason why. A lighter came alongside and we have loaded all our hospital equipment on board and we were fully dressed to go on to the hospital ship, when word came that the lighter had to return to the beach at once and our boat with us on board had to retire to Lemnos immediately, we had to move all the stuff up by ropes against orders, we got most of it up, but the lighter went away with a lot of our stores and medical equipment on.  This we will never see again but if wounded are coming in on the lighter they will bless us as there was a lot of medical comforts and provisions on the lighter.</p>
<p>We proceeded out of the danger [indecipherable] full speed with two destroyers clearing the way for us, shells were bursting in the water only a mile away from us, we were all pleased however that we did not have to go on the hospital ship and be broken off from our old mates, we do not know the [indecipherable] intentions but we have been right up to the fight and had a wonderful view and had to leave too soon, as it became  dangerous for us [indecipherable]  We arrived at Lemnos and found a lot of other transports there in the beautiful harbour.  They all have nurses on board and are [indecipherable] like us.  There are a lot of cruisers here as well as the now famous Queen Elizabeth, she is a beauty.  The hospital ship Talima [?] followed us in so we are all in dread of going on her yet.  It is reported that there are now three Austrian submarines about brought [indecipherable] in sections  The harbour is netted in on account of them.</p>
<p>Saturday, 15th May.<br/>Reports state that during the night two of the Austrian submarines were caught by means of a strategic trick [?].  The big battle that we watched on the hills the other night resulted in an Allied victory.  Three lines of trenches were recaptured by the British &amp; French's. Early in the morning the Col and Capt Ramsden came on board from the Galeka cheers were given for the Capt and groans for the Col.  We then informed that we had to go on the Galeka,  the bearers and tent division and thus separate us from our mates and drivers and break up the old coy that we were all so proud and fond of.  We boarded a lighter after lunch and said goodbye to our old pals, they cheered us to the echo climbing up the rigging and everywhere is was a happy farewell but it was a sentimental one as it was the separation of firm friends of nine months acquaintance.</p>
<p>Then we went across to the Galeka and boarded her and found the  [indecipherable]  on board her they must have been there ever since they left  but they were reinforcements for the 3rd Field Ambulance that got completely wiped out in the big fight.  We found the ship to be everything that can be desired she is spotlessly clean with four decks she was a passenger steamer to Africa [indecipherable] and carries three classes.  We find that she is not a hospital ship but a depot for medical details.  there are men of other medical [indecipherable] on her and we were to be drawn as details whenever we are wanted we may go in a day we may go in a mos time [indecipherable] but we are better off than the drivers who have to return to Alexandria.  Thank God we have no horses on board this ship it the one bright thing about it [indecipherable] my mate and I did was to have a look around and pinched  a side of bacon. it will be a change to bully beef and rock biscuits.</p>
