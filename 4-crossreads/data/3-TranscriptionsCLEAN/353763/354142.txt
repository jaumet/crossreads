The submarines looked just like whales  -  They came alongside us & the offers came aboard  -  Besant - Haggard - Stoker - Moore - Scarlett from Gayndah way & others  -  We lunched & talked & then from the deck we watched the Admiral's ship transmitting the news about Kagakaul & his regrets at the fatalities  -  We don't know how many Germans are dead nor about Herbert Hohe (Hohe must refer to the hills at the back)  -Raboul will come now - a landing party will go out  -  No shelling of course  -  We all wonder we weren't sniped at last night till we doused our lights  -The war ships are coaling  -  The Parramatta lies with banked fires - ready to slip out & collar anything  -  No German ships - warships - are collared yet  -  Their bases are being destroyed  -  We look a bit imposing & of course are a very formidable crowd  -  The Australia dominates everything & everybody & is a splendid looking ship  = The Murex - an oil ship - is also here  -  The Submarine men look very fit  -  They put into Port Moresby  -  They say the Townsville contingent
