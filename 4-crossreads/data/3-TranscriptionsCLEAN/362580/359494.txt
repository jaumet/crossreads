appreciate our home life.  There is absolutely no place where any sister could go to dinner nor spend the evening, so it is grand to have a sociable matron.
Sunday-night - two officers came in from the camp where we had dinner last Monday and we took them to church - now we have a large tent for Church Services and quite a number were there.  We still have the funny little street organ but all manage to sing the hymns with vigor.  The men of this Unit are an awfully respectable crowd, & attend church services well also very little drink amongst them.  To-day three sisters & three, officers are yatching on the Lake - I'm one of the three.  So you see we have plenty of amusement provided for us when off duty.
I seem to get very little time for writing - the time flies & bed is so nice.  Hope you are all well.  Mind you write every week, even if it is only a P.C.  Fondest love & kisses to you all
FromYour loving sisterEdith
