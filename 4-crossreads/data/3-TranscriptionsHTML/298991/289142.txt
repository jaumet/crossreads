<p>Wednesday February 14th<br/>We are having a considerable number of changes regarding Officers. Handed gas helmets in for examination. An examination will be held on such every Wednesday afternoon. Had a good few patients through during the day. Wrote three letters during the afternoon. Handed pay books in for new ones to be issued full particulars taken.</p>
<p>Thursday February 15th<br/>This last couple of days there has been a great number of 13th Btn men go through here with scabies. Saw Sid Cooper this evening, he informed me that all the fellows I know came through the stunt alright. He also spoke of the experience he went through. Beautiful day all day, the sun was quite warm for a change.</p>
<p>Friday February 16th<br/>Owing to Lance Corporal McGregor (in charge of "receiving point)" being promoted to Waggon Orderly Cpl, &amp; taking over his duties as such, we now have another Lance Cpl in charge. We have a great deal of discipline in this camp now, blankets are to be rolled in a certain way, must be neat &amp; level, then great coat, pack, steel helmet, gas respirator, &amp; equipment must be put in regulation fashion, such to the desire of a well hated Major we have in our unit. Very easy day, had hardly any patients. Mail closed for Australia today. Rained during the afternoon.</p>
<p>Saturday February 17th<br/>Showery rain nearly all day. Very foggy this afternoon &amp; evening. Everywhere is very boggy. The Sergeant Cook here is as funny as a circus, if you call him Sergeant upon approaching him for anything, he will give you absolutely anything you require, but! Call him Copey (his name is Copeland) &amp; you will get nothing but a growl, of course I always allude to him as sergeant.</p>
