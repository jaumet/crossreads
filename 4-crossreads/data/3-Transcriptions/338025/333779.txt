<p>Wednesday 29th August 1917<br/>Dickebusch<br/>Took waggon to 105th waggon lines at 9am.<br/>Left there about 9.30am and went up to 105th pits for a load of empty shell cases. Brought them back for another load which I've brought to dump to near camp. Very quiet at Pits, but Fritz making it very hot near Shrapnel Corner. Very rough road near pit. Driving through shell holes. Get back to camp about 6pm.</p>
