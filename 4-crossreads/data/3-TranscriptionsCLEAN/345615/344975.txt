  
 They were good horses  and we had to hang on  pulling on the bit to be off all the time & I came back from the ride as  pleasan  hungry as a hunter. with the 'pip' gone for the time 
 Everything seems very quiet now The shaking up they got on Xmas Day seems to have take all the sting out of the enemy & I don't think there will be  much more serious trouble, though I expect a force will be kept here for some time. 
  Have been passing  My best pals are all away on the trek, so instead of yarning in their tent - Ive been smoking on my own & read Kiplings "Five nations" sent me by Edie & Mop (Sisters) for Xmas.
