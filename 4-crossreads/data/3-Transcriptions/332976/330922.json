<p>September 1917<br/>16 Continued   Lt. Clarke met with an accident to-night &amp; was taken away to hospital.   I went over &amp; saw Charlie Kay (18th Batn.) who has been up on this front three days.<br/>17th   We are still working on the huts &amp; have finished 18.   The 6th Batn moved out &amp; the 8th London Reg. came in, on their way out of the line &amp; are staying for the night.<br/>18th   We continued with the huts to-day &amp; the 5th Batn took over the huts when the "Londons" left.   Fritz was giving us a fair amount of Shrapnel during the day but his range was a little over estimated &amp; very few casualties were caused.   Early this morning <strike>all</strike> our artillery gave Fritz an hours barrage.   Over twenty prisoners passed us to-day.  (Every day there have been on an average of 10 passed us on there way to the "cage")</p>
