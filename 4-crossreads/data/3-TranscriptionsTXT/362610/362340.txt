 Thursday 4 May 1916 A dull day with occasional showers but little heavy rain. Stayed inside censoring letters &amp;c. The camp was visited by Brig-General Carruthers &amp; his A.A.G., special steps being taken to tidy up the place &amp; have things looking well. At mess-time the band from the 3rd Battn. played outside, the music sounding lovely in the twilight. Visited by 2 of the American sisters in the evening.
