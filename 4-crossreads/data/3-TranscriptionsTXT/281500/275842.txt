they also say that the 3rd Division have been in action at Armentieres.A lot of details arrived tonight for D Coy. Had quite a welcome mail tonight 7 letters 5 papers and 2 parcels, there are not many things a chap looks forward to in the army but mail is always the principal one. 21st  A fairly warm night and the land thawed and once again we are among the mud and slush, had all my men digging a road through the huts and just about 11 o'clock it started to rain fairly heavy, but they would not knock us off but made the mob go and get their waterproofs how they swore. A big squadron of our aeroplanes flew over towards the German lines this morning.
