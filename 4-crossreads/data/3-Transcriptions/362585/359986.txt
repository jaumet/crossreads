<p>France<br/>4.1.17</p>
<p>Dear mother,</p>
<p>this paper would hardly lead you to suspect that I was A.D.C. to a Divisional General, but it only goes to show that you can't go by appearances.  We were in reserve on Dec. 28th, when MacCallum told me that he has put my name in, &amp; that Gen. Holmes wished to see me.  This meant a two mile walk over duckboards eighteen inches wide, with mud two feet high on either side, to Brigade Headquarters.  The staff were quartered in a beautiful deep roomy safe dug-out where I stayed as long as possible, &amp; as there was no opposition, got the job.</p>
<p>Having dwelt in the mud area of France, I retract everything I ever said about England.  There isn't a place on Salisbury Plains that I wouldn't gladly make a bed - &amp; sleep well too.  Talking about beds &ndash; my gear has gone astray already.  Not that that is anything out of the ordinary but it seems rather sudden doesn't it.  No doubt it will turn up in time, but in the meanwhile, I have had to spend hundreds of good francs to make myself look respectable.  It would take another hundred to make me feel that way.</p>
<p>Being the youngest member of the mess, I am mess secretary.  The previous victim went to Boulogne some days ago with all the books &amp; all the money.  Once there, he went into a hospital &amp; got sick</p>
