<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Nothing doing to-day.&nbsp; There is still an absence of fresh water for ablution purposes.&nbsp; Have to do all this in salt water which makes one feel very sticky, more especially under tropical conditions.&nbsp; Went to Hospital to see how Duncan Woolley was and stayed with him and yarned.&nbsp; Found him much improved.&nbsp; In the afternoon, Lt. Gray gave us a French lesson.&nbsp; At night we had a visit from the Kent&#39;s band which gave the troops a rare musical treat.&nbsp; This place is still as hot as Hades.&nbsp; There seems to be no diminution in these sultry and trying conditions and one only imagines how welcome one of our dear old Sydney&#39;s southerlies would be to alleviate the oppression a little, if only for <s>an</s> one hour.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">The heat is still with us.&nbsp; All on board were hoaxed this afternoon as the ship was observed to be moving forward under her own steam.&nbsp; Turned out to be only a move further into the stream.&nbsp; Freetown has a sandy bottomed harbor with a current that flows at the rate of about eight knots per hour.&nbsp; This move was a result of the ship&#39;s change in position and the danger of collision in the case of a heavy blow, which comes to these places, <u>at times</u>.&nbsp; Called to see Woolley again.&nbsp; He was much better.&nbsp; Had a washing parade.&nbsp; Used rain water out of the ship&#39;s boats from the last storm.&nbsp; Events much the same as usual.</td>

<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">Sunday.&nbsp; Came off guard.&nbsp; Very tired and sleepy.&nbsp; Detailed for church service.&nbsp; Rather annoyed at missing a sleep after guard.&nbsp; Got it over and peeled off to try and keep cool and then had dinner.&nbsp; In afternoon spent the time lying on the deck in the shade.&nbsp; Eat coconuts and oranges.&nbsp; At night the quartette rendered Adeste Fidelis at church meeting on deck.&nbsp; Did not go around the ship singing carols, as was intended, as we all felt too tired from the previous night&#39;s guard.&nbsp; Result of Coaling competition was announced.&nbsp; Engineers party won and were awarded the prize of &pound;2.</td>
