<p>pieces by the German artillery. In the afternoon I lay on the grass in the shade &amp; had a sleep. It is a treat to have a quite lie down after the last rough fortnight. After tea I wrote up my diary, then Draper &amp; I walked up the road looking for a blanket, &amp; our luck was in. As we were passing a shed, a chap sang out to some fellows lying around "This way for your blankets", so we just walked  in &amp; drew one each with this unit. Luck eh!<br/>Six of us slept under the tarpaulin shelter &amp; had a good night's sleep. It was a lovely moonlight night.<br/>22nd August<br/>I got a nice Aussie mail this morning, letters from home, Newcastle &amp; Moree, then I was warned to go with two men as escort to bring back a deserter. We were very disgusted, just out of the line for a spell, &amp; having to tramp after these brutes that clear out. My instructions were to report to the A.P.M. at Villers Bretonneux. It would take too long to describe our devious route to that spot, it was a fearfully hot day, &amp; the white dust from the military traffic was thick, &amp; I pitied some Tommies working on the road like convicts in the heat &amp; dust. Found the 4th Division A.P.M. &amp; heard that the "bird" was not there, so we jumped on</p>
