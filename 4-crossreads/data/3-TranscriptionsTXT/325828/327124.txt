Almost immediately about 150 children were around the plane gaping at it.  I met two men walking up to the place, of whom I asked the way to the nearest telephone.  They didn't understand my question &amp; I was surprised a little later to hear they were Austrians,  supposed  to be interned. This decided me not to leave the machine in search of a 'phone, so learning that some special police were camped near by, I gave a couple of small boys 3d. each to go down to the police with a note requisitioning a guard for the machine. Half an hour later a big burly Sgt. of Police &amp; a special came along, to whom I turned over the responsibility of the 'plane.  I then went into the nearest village (1 &frac12; mls) with 20 kiddies following me, &amp; phoned through to the 'drome that I and the machine were O.K.  The owner of this big house took me home, and made me very comfortable.  He and his wife (Mr. &amp; Mrs. Percy Luce) were awfully kind to me &amp; Mr. Luce explained that he had a warm place in his heart for Australians as he had relatives in Adelaide.
