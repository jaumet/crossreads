<p>In the Field</p>
<p>My dear Irene,</p>
<p>With your letter came the news that Fred had been killed in action on the 5th November &amp; they had buried him at Bull's Road near Guendecourt &amp; I cabled my wife to that effect asking her to inform you.  It may appear to you that I have not let you know anything still I am not allowed to write anyone until the fact was definitely settled.  Had I been with the same Division as Fred at the time it would have been quite different but the day I returned with Fred from leave I was informed of my transfer &amp; from that day I never saw Fred again for he went to join his Battalion &amp; I came over here.  His Division &amp; mine went into action simultaneously &amp; we were fighting like mad for a month so that it was late when I heard anything.</p>
<p>I then tried to find out anyone who had seen him &amp; I ascertained that none of those who were in his party ever came back.</p>
<p>I then found that one man who was wounded said Fred was wounded.  Eventually I ascertained Fred was last seen bandaging one of his wounded men named Burns &amp; this was verified when they found him for he was in the act of Bandaging Burns when he was, poor fellow, shot through the head &amp; fell forward.  Death having been instantaneous, so that he did not suffer any pain, &amp; he was found in that position when we made this last advance.  I went &amp; saw the C/o of his Battalion with reference to putting up a cross or something to mark the spot</p>
