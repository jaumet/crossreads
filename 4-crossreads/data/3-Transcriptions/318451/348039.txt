<p>Dug out &amp; as we were at lunch Fritz began shelling us.  He sent over quite a few.  It gives one a queer sensation at first when shells fall near one, but the feeling is "stay still &amp; hope they will go anywhere else".  I went along nearly all our Front line yesterday.  It is in a terrible condition in some places.  It is just churned up with shell fire, wet &amp; cold.<br/>Got back about dark very tired.</p>
<p>Thursday 7th<br/>Visited Hospital this morning, also looked out place for service.  Raining slightly, cold.</p>
<p>Friday 8th<br/>Visited the Trenches today, had lunch with Capt. Connell.  A heavy bombardment began at 1.30 &amp; continued till about dark.  Great shells went screaming overhead &amp; burst with a dull thud in the enemy's trenches.<br/>Mills looked in after Tea.</p>
