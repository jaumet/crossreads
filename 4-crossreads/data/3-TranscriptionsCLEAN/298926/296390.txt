  
 I found that I was swearing & it gave me quite a fright                               That night I vowed to drop my friends and seek the narrow path                     But when the sun brought morning I forgot it with a laugh 
 They took me to a house and showed me how to play at cards                  For pennies then for shillings, for the right I'd no regards                           They gave me stuff to drink & though at first it tasted queer                                      I soon required no asking for to take a glass of beer. 
 It made me think I was a man and acted as men do,                        Although I saw the shattered wrecks & well the cause I knew
