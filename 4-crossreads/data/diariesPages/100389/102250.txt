arrive in Belgium
now though the weather is still dull.
All the afternoon a heavy bombardment could be heard coming from the region of Pozieres. Last of the 4th Aus. Div. came out of the line today. Canadians march in.
6th Reveille at 4 am and after the usual routine we moved off at about 7.30 am. Progress was very slow and after many halts arrived at Herrisart, where we stopped for dinner. By 2pm we were on the way and at 4 pm reached Beauval where pitched camp for the night. This is the largest village I have been to since leaving Abbeyville. It is nicely situated in a valley and cannot be seen from a distance on account of the thick foliage about it. Fine weather prevails, for which we are all mighty thankful.
7th Fine day. Harness cleaning all day. On "leave" to Doullens. Good time.
8th Inspection of harness by C.O. Hooked in at 4pm and at about 5 pm left for Doullens where we arrived at about 7.30 pm. We should have arrived about 6.15 pm but as usual plenty of mistakes & blunders were made, such as taking the wrong road & stopping to
