<p>Wed 26th Sept. (cont.)<br/>Immediately after the stopping shot the bulwarks crashed down and the full armament was cleared for action.</p>
<p>A few beams had been left out of the hatch and through this some of us were watching the German ensign and pennant flying from the main mast when a sheet of flame shot over the hatch, we were all knocked backwards by the air-concussion, the hold filled with thick yellow smoke, and all loose timber, bolts etc clattered down on the deck.</p>
<p>The other vessel was imitating the "Clan McTavish-Moewe" [indecipherable], and was trying to use her anti-U-boat gun.    I have no idea as to the number of shots which we fired, but the other ship did not get a single shell in.   The flash had been the from the "Wolf's" guns as they were fired across the deck above our heads.</p>
