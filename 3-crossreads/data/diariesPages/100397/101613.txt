Now I dont know what else to tell you so I am going out for a walk, as there is nothing else doing this evening and perhaps when I come in I will have found a little more news, so for the present so long.
I did not find any news the other day, when out, and since have not done any writing, so here goes I must try and finish this as soon as possible A couple of days ago. a few more Letters arrived one from home, one from Dora. C. and other from Aunt Nellie, Letters have not been coming to hand quite so well, of late, but that may be altered ere long for I believe that certain alterations have been in progress in the Postal arrangements over on the Blighty side and they may improve matters. Lately the weather has not been nearly so cold, and the mud has not grown any less in consequence, Showery weather has been the rule for some days past, and the result is far from pleasant, what is must be like up in the outposts, I can easily imagine from past experience. I am glad that I have missed them .. though it means that I will be right in the middle of next stunt, whatever it may be, There are many strange rumours afloat at the present time, one of them has been very much discussed and I would not be surprised myself if it had been set afloat as a blind for the civilian population, of course it may be true
