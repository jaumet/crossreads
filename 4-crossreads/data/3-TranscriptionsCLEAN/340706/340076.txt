122pleasantest day I have spent here
The enlightened tone of the conversation was in itself fascinating while the eager & active part taken by the quick witted women was a revalation.As I said before one cannot appreciate the race which is greater than even the English race, unless one can fluently speak the language.
21-4-19 (Mon)Again I find myself on the billeting stunt & in afternoon receive a letter from Capt E R Holme & immediately forward another S40 form as all previous ones seem to have gone astray.
I then visit my friends & find several ladies present & a barrister brother in law from Abbeville who gives me some good information re law. The conversation between the ladies of whom there are about 7 is quite different from our talk being of a breadth & depth not usually associated with women while the male element is as mercurial as a schoolboy & as light.
We see the avocat off & then I return to mess at 6.30 as I do not wish to burden them with my presence for dinner
