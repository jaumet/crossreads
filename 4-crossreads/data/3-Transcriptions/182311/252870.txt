<p>On then and through the same glorious scenery, back in time for Dinner in the Mess.&nbsp; A glorious trip which extended just over thirty-six hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, Normandie is a land of beauty and of romance too, for it is the scene of the exploits of Joan of Arc, and Richard Coeur de Lion, of Knights in Armour rescuing Fair Damsels in Distress, and of romantic looking castles and chateaux, perched on craggy heights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely yours,</p>
