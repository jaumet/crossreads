<p>Lamp practice tonight from 6.30 to 8.pm.Plenty of practice is required yet. although the majority of messages went through rapidly and accurately. I go to town tomorrow to pay another visit to the dentist. I shall be glad in a/way when the job is finished although as things are it furnishes me with an excellent excuse. "Pharoah" my horse was very lively and headstrong this morning although I took him for a long ride and I also went on a much longer ride yesterday. He improves with hard work I think. Much better to have a horse with some life in him than to be mounted on some wooden horse where one is continually "legging" them up. So "Pharaoh" and I get on remarkably well in that respect. Wilson had him for months before I got him but he was always bolting with him and he never seemed to be capable of holding him. I have no trouble We now have our <strike>own </strike>canteen which is opened in our own Camp the nearest one before was at Wardan Station, and quite 10 minutes walk through the soft sand. Sgt Bruce paid us a visit from Heliopolis he went back this morning also Sgt McLennon from Alexandria he also went back.</p>
