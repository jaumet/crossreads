For the frailty of human judgements. I believe Jap. Admiral was convinced that the G's were within 200 miles of us, &amp; we were in the 1st degree of vigilance. We feel that that victory belongs rightfully to us, &amp; that we have been robbed off it. We drove them out of the Pacific, &amp; in the vast stretch of waters we guarded, the G's did no harm. Ours is only a small affair, but it has cost some 3500 lives, friend &amp; foe to straighten it out. Everybody listless &amp; fed up as a result.
