<p>Capt. Gleason our Quarter Master is a clinker on his job.  Rations are plentiful and very good.</p>
<p>11.15 p.m.  I turned in and tried to sleep but the events of the day kept churning over in my mind.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that Capt. Steele and Lieut. Cookson </strike>wer</strike> of A company were both wounded about 2 p.m.  A fragment of shell struck Mr. Cookson on the steel hat and stunned him.  It then glided off on to Capt. Steele's right arm and rendered it useless.  Mr. Cookson was severely shaken by the blow but <strike>me</strike> both men remained on duty.</p>
