  
 Summer's Day - The sea side resort is neither "Manly" or "Bournemouth" & yet in many respects resembles both to a great degree - While lacking the size & importance of Bournemouth and the sands & surf of Manly, it is more picturesque than either - A resting & pleasant resort for Parisians & Tourists - The Coves indulge in a morning swim which is greatly enjoyed by all - In the afternoon we give our "second entertainment"
