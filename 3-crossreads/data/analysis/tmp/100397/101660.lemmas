 Franc 20/7/18 . Dear Bett . I have yet to thank you for your last letter . So forthwith . . receiv my thank for same at onc , of news , that is new , or interest I have but littl , still what I can find I will send . I left my littl dug-out in the trench three day ago , and after sundri delay , arriv at this place . . " It 's a quiet littl place , hidden away in a hollow , tween the hill , and allmost hidden by tree . . You dont see it until allmost in the centr so you can guess , the popul doe not exceed 1,000,000 in fact it 's a littl less . " I ve seen sever french men sinc arriv here . . but that not what I was go to write about . The first part of the journey was accomplish per "boot , the second stage per motor lorri , and the third by Rail , and the fourth by boot so you see we had quit a high old time , for late , we have done all our travel in the manner last mention . . The countri here is rather pretti , and after the flat countri it rather nice to get into a part where they can boast of a few hill , even if they are not so good for farm purpos . the crop here do not compar , with those I have been amongst for the last few week . Yet these are worth more , for they will be harvest and the other will not , that is the differ .
