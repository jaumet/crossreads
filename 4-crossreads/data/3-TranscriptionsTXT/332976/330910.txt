August 191715th   We had a big route march this morning passing through Lynde, Renescure, Eblinghem & Wallen Chip Chappel, & returned about 1.30 P.M.   Rain handicapped us to a great extent & near Eblinghem our transport got into difficulty & we were fully an hour crossing the swamp.We had the afternoon off after returning.There has been a heavy bombardment for the last couple of days & increased during last night.   Some of Fritz's planes were over to-night & dropped bombs around Steinbecque.16th   We had squad drill & bayonet fighting this morning & a bathing parade this afternoon.   Fritz has been shelling Hazebrouck all day & now the town has practically no civilians in it, all having taken refuge further back.
