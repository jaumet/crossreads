<p>Sunday 21 October</p>
<p>To "K" Supply Column<br/>To 1st Anzac Corps Headquarters.<br/>To A.D.M.S. Ypres via Poperinghe<br/><u>Note</u>  Though in most cases I only mention A.D.M.S. when in reality I mean 5th Div. Hd. Q., it may be stated here that I have to take returns to the Asst. Director of Medical Services.  This is the all important factor of each trip, but in addition I also have despatches for The 5th Div. Paymaster, The Veterinary Officer, The Engineers, etc. &amp; various despatches to be sent via D.R.L.S.</p>
