<p>took my leave.</p>
<p>May 26.<br/>We took our lunch to the rifle-range early this morning &amp; returned to the billet at 2 in the afternoon after a good morning's shooting.</p>
<p>I went for a walk in the evening.   There are a couple of French customs which struck me as rather strange at first.   At about 6.30 each morning a girl goes along the village streets blowing a horn &amp; about ten minutes later, as she returns, all the cows from the different yards turn out &amp; follow her.  She then takes them out to the fields &amp; minds them all day &amp; returns them as she got them.   The boys call this horn the "Cow's Reveille".</p>
<p>Then again it is rather quaint to see many of the people driving their horses with one rein.   However, Mlle.. Labateux explained</p>
