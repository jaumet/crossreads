10th Sunday. Our Field guns and Heavy Trench Mortors opened fire on "Fritz" position known as "Game Copse" for about 15 minutes early this morning. Fritz replied with a few 5-9 shells, 2 of our Coy wounded. About 9 o,clock to night the 3rd Division on our right make a raid on Enemy positions near "Warneton" with Artillery preparation, which was successful. "Fritz" gave us the usual display of fire works, without a doubt it was a fine sight, flares of all descriptions colours were flying sky-high.
11th Our guns again busy this morning, fireing at what is known as "Moat Farm" about 300 yards on our left front. "Fritz" gets spitefull and drops a few of his Trench mortor shells around our post, no damage done. His Artillery caused a few casualties near "Railway" trench in front of "Battle Wood".
12th More rain fell to night makeing the country a sea of mud again. "Fritz" guns pretty busty about 8 o,clock to night shelling some pill-boxes known as the "Clusters" a few fell close to our post, wounding one of my boys. His machine guns clacking away pretty busy trying to knock ration and other working parties, he appears to have a great number of machine guns on this sector.
13th Artillery on both sides very active during the day. We were releived about 7 o,clock to night by D/Coy 46th Bn, it was raining fairly heavy and an awful dark night, we had difficulty in finding our way back to support lines, a great many were lost untill the following morning. We had about 500 yds to go before we reached supports, and it took a small party of us just on 2 hours to get there (Going some) After a trudge along duck-boards for about 3 miles, we picked up some motor lorries at "Spoil Bank" and were conveyed to "Parret Camp", near Mount Kemmel arriveing early next morning pretty tired.
