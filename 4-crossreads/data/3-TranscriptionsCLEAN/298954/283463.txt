Thu 31st May (cont.)31st May (cont.)The Juniors recover the use of their tongues later - we have quite a jolly little card party in Ree's cabin.  Rees, by the way, was torpedoed on the "Ashburton" in the Bay of Biscay recently.
Fri. 1st JuneWeather still perfect.  Sea quite calm.  Complete all details of installation today.  Wireless Receiver working very well - had VIS (Sydney) VPD (Suva) etc. last night.
The Captain calls me into his cabin and "supposes" I had "better see this".
"This" is the wireless distress code on encountering enemy raiders!
And 36 hours out of port he "supposes" that I should see it!!
