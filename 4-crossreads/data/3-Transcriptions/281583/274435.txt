<p>Some of the heads came up &amp; paid us today although what we can do with money out here is a mystery to me. The mud is now knee deep again &amp; very hard to walk in on account of it being slippery.</p>
<p>20.11.16 Monday</p>
<p>The weather still continues to be very cold, with alternative showers of icy cold rain thrown in. We had plenty of German shells to keep us company last night &amp; the way they whistled through the air, fairly made me sick. The naval guns close by us opened up at about 9 pm &amp; kept at it for a couple of hours making sleep impossible.  They silenced Fritz however as he was afraid of giving away his position.</p>
<p>Our supply trains have not arrived so far &amp; we have advice that they will not reach here until 1am in the morning. This is not very pleasant as it means unloading &amp; checking in the dark &amp; slush. The only thing I am hoping is that the Germans will not send over any shells, as it is hard to watch everybody at night.</p>
<p>Just as I am waiting a few observation Balloon are going up. This as usual means more shelling both by Fritz &amp; us. The 2nd Div are moving back to Vignacourt but I fancy we are staying here. Our Battalions are coming out of the trench &amp; moving to Becourt</p>
