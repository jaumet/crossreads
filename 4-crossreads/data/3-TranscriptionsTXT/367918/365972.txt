3transit camp for all the Mesopotamia people on their way home. It may also be used for Australians, but I think they will probably be shipped from Kantara.
I have just got back a few days from a week's Xmas leave during which I paid a flying visit to Luxor & Assonan, a very interesting trip and well worth the tedious train journey - especially on a free warrant.
I'm hoping for another mail any day now as its over a month since I've had one from home.
With very best wishes to you all
Yours affectionatelyGeorge M. Edwards
