Saturday 27 November, 1915
Met Sid at the Olympia Club at about 10.45. He beat me at billiards for the first time.
Money being short I had dinner & came back to camp & left Sid to look up some friends etc as he still had a few bob left.
I called into St Georges hospital & gave the nurses some prints of some photos I had taken a few days before.
I came back to camp just in time as I had been wanted & was told to report so I did & was told to hold myself ready to go to Goza [Gozo] an island a few miles from Malta. I will try & get out of it.
