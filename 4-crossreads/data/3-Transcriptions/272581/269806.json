<p>January 1916<br/>On the 18th we saw the coast of Africa &amp; also another lighthouse  &amp;  several small islands. A peculiarity about these islands is that  they are huge masses of Iguana rock which is used as a fertilizer  &amp;  some of them have been quarried. On the 20th we were issued with our brown kit bags &amp; also with 24 hours rations. We reached Port Suez during the early morn of the next day &amp; waited outside till about seven o'clock  &amp;  then pulled into the stream. Several Man-o-wars &amp; other naval boats &amp; liners could be seen  &amp; dozens of native crafts with three cornered sails were sailing about loading  &amp;  unloading Cargo boats etc. Sea-Gulls flew round the boats in thousands &amp; schools of small fish swam round the boats also.</p>
<p>The Town of Suez could be seen from on board   &amp; the first things that attracts the attention of the eye is dozens of  big round white tanks right on the waters edge which contain oilX during the afternoon the "Caloola" an Australian Hospital ship pulled out from the wharf laden with soldiers bound for home  &amp;  when they crossed our bow  &amp; went passed us there was great cheering. We stayed on board all that night  &amp; the next morning the 21st another Hospital boat pulled out  &amp; we took its place at the wharf. The harbour is divided from the sea by a big brake water &amp; is not a  very big harbour inside. <br/>The train runs right onto the wharf &amp; there is also a coaling stage. The first sight</p>
