25/1/18 Chester. Queen Hotel
walked down to the River Dee which here is a fine stream and turns mills. From the walls is a prospect of green fields and general trimness. A high tower on one part of the Walls is where King Charles viewed his troops defeated in a battle here. Where the wall spans the main street is an ornamental clock presented by a local bigwig. The peculiarity of Chester lies in its gabled houses with their carved fronts and many recent buildings erected have been modelled and built on the same lines. The physique of many of the soldiers going about is deplorable and many of the little rats are in hospital blue. Caught the Irish Mail at 1.55 and had a passable run to London. Taxied from Euston to Belgrave Mansions and there put up for the night.
