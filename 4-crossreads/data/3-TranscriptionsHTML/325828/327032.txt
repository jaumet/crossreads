<p>Adminis: Headquarters,<br/>London<br/>Easter Sunday Evg<br/>8th Apl 1917</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>No mail of any kind has come to hand since I wrote last- about 8 or 9 days ago.  Your last letter came to hand last Friday week, dated 22/12/16, but on the 15th of last month I received yours of 21st Jany 17.  This is the latest news I have had from home.  By the same mail as yours of 22/12/16 came one from Mother written the same day, &amp; also one from Anna of 17/12/16.  Likewise one from Wal, written when nearing Durban on <strike>23/1/17</strike> 9/2/7.  His previous one written near St Helena on 23/1/17 reached me 3 days earlier.<br/>Easter is drawing to a close once more.  It seems incredible that 12 months have gone since last Easter but such it is:-  I have been kept busy this year over Easter-time.  The rush started on Thursday morning   That day I was relieving in the Furlo' room, &amp; about 10 a.m. the mob started<br/>coming in for their passes over the Holidays. At 1.30 I cleared out for 20 minutes to lunch &amp; then from 2 o'clock I didn't leave my desk till</p>
