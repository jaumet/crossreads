  
 December 7, 8 27. A reported conversation of two evil geniuses ... 
 M.J. Hay.  But if we stop them going, they'll probably kick up a row and write to the Minister for Defence - a Hughes! 
 Mj. M.r.II.  Well we'll have to chance that! 
 "What a crowd!" "What a crew!!"  G.B.S. 
 December 8 28. From Mother - things are crook!  Maurie and self away to Chatelat this afternoon - and a finding there of no money for Blighty, and up to the Chateau tonight after money find here awaiting 12 from Tabb'd --!... Mac. 
 December 9, 10 Brussels 29. Midnight, and back from an evening spent at the Opera - Thais - with a wounderful Thais and a splendid [indecipherable] [Palemon ?].  Arriving Brussels 5.40 we'd just time to book seats - separately in different parts of the house.  Met there Jack M., Elk and another of the Amb.  After to the [indecipherable], disappointing but good beer there. 
 So to bed. 
 December 10 30. - And not an Anzac - or any other M.P. yet seen!
