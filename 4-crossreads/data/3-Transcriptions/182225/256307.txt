<p>JULY&nbsp;&nbsp; FRIDAY 7&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine some of the morning but rain &amp; mist in afternoon &amp; very cold. We had to clean up all our brass work &amp; equipment in morning &amp; do any washing we wanted done. A couple of the guard were sick and I took mess orderly for our part of it for the mid-day meal. We read all afternoon the finals for the boxing were to be held this afternoon, but owing to the wind they were postponed.</p>
