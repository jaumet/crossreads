<p>Wednesday 14 November 1917<br/>Reported Matron's office 8.30 a.m.  Dusted, did th. dressings for sterilizing, washed fly traps.  C. Collins came in &amp; smiling as usual, asked what I was doing &amp; Matron told him I had taken to beer.<br/>Marton [Matron] speaks to me in the nicest way possible.  "What did you say child," &amp; are you feeling really better, &amp; means it too.  Sent me off duty 3.30 p.m. &amp; need not go back unless convoy comes in.  No convoy so creep to bed feeling very weak after "gippi" &amp; take a dose of oil &amp; pray for strength again.  When will it come back I wonder?</p>
