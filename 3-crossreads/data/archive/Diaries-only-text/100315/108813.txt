23/4/18 ? Lavieville
heavies were plastering heavily into Albert and also getting some good direct hits on roads. Saw quite a number of Huns walking up and down the roads well behind Albert. On the left is Bouzaincourt where we spent a very pleasant month once. It is wretched to think of all these places being in Hun hands. Spent a very busy afternoon in arranging details of our relief tomorrow night. Col. Dawson of the 25th Battn. came and we pored over maps together. This large sidestep is a complicated business.
