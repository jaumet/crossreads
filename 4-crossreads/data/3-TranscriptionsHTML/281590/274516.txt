<p>Nov &amp; Dec 1917<br/>27th - 15th  Dec    woman we have treated. Not on any occasion (Gaza excepted) have the British hit any village &amp; Gaza was deserted by all civilians &amp; used by Jacko for defensive purposes. However about 31st we shifted to place at Sandhills near Jaffa Gaza road &amp; about 3pm on 3rd 2 hours in advance of brigade Nye Walker &amp; self started off for Belah (50 m). Reached Esdud about 11pm &amp; camped till daybreak. Surprising the ignorance in topography of the Tommies. 6m from Yebna one told us it was a mile ahead 3 miles further on it was still a mile &amp; at Kubibe a S/Off told us K was Deiran &amp; Yebna 5 m distant. We knew better &amp; 1&frac12; m further on we saw our Bde advance party (7am). Had tea not far from Yebna &amp; pushed on. In am started about 7am arriving Deir Sineid (now Detail Camp) about 4pm. Rained like the very devil.</p>
<p>Novr Decr<br/>27th-15) Saw Trost &amp; Davis of 4th L.H.F.A. here. No time for visiting Canteens Road very slippery so we walked for a while. Reached Gaza about 6.30 camped &amp; left again 8.30 or 9am next day Light rain falling, saw parts of Gaza, every place branded O/B. no one save a few Gyppo soldiers to block us &amp; they cleared at sight of us. Bmbdmt must have been hell, hard work to dodge shell holes. Spent a couple of hours there, some parts of town where the gun emplacements were, blown to fragments. At Deir Sineid, naval gun hit one of Jacko's engines &amp; left it a heap of scrap iron.</p>
<p>Rained nearly all day &amp; soaked we pulled up at Dental tent &amp; were very glad to get under cover, get practically dry &amp; warm tea.</p>
