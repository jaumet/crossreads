<p>mistake he never made in all his life, as it was afterwards proved, it was a living hell. The 1st and 3rd Batteries were practially in the same position, on our right. Things went smoothly for a few days, that is as regards shells, Every night rifle bullets come over in hundreds, and strange  to relate, no man in wagon lines was ever hit and only one horse. The 3rd Bty was the first to get peppered, rifle bullets played hovac with their horses, Then the 1st Bty suffered from shell fire. The 3rd Bty was the first to shift, followed by the 1st. We the 2nd Bty were there three weeks. In the mean time the shells started to come over, about 20 yards on our left, till one day they got in amongst us, knocking one spoke out of a wheel and wounding one horse. After a while it quietened down. I might just mention the fact that this horse I have just recorded was the first horse I ever saw with a shrapnel bullet wound While I was dressing it some more shots rattled through the lines, all around me, no damage done. The Captain was burrowed up in his dugout, he called me over and said, Farrier, if any more shrapnel come over tell the drivers, to rush to their horses</p>
