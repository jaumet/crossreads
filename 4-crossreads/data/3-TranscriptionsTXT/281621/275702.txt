 Sunday 10 Hinted that I shall go on convalescent soon. 
 Tuesday 12 Afternoon drive to Keston Common between Farnborough &amp; Bromley in Kent. We were entertained by &amp; at the home of Mrs Wheeler Bennett which is situated in beautiful grounds. The route out lay past the Chrystal Palace &amp; along the fringe of the Surrey Hills &amp; back, through the suburbs. 
 Wednesday 13 Apparently there was an air raid on London this morning at 11.45. I saw the shells from Archies bursting but not the planes. Rumour says that Bank Cannon St &amp; Ludgate Hill were bombed but know nothing of casualties. Went before a board this morning &amp; I suppose I will soon be going convalescent.  Major Wilson &amp; his wife have just been in &amp; they tell me that poor Reg Shergold has died of wounds. 
 Thursday 14 In yesterdays raid over four hundred wounded &amp; ninety killed &amp; much damage done. Drive &amp; outing to Box Hill Surrey where we had tea at Burford Bdge Hotel. A great day Surrey with its villages roads, fields, hills &amp; trees like Kent baffles all adjectives of description. The most beautiful imagineable. 
 Friday 15 Beautiful weather still. Fine concert this evening figuring Mr Theo Ward musical advisor to Sir Thos Wyndham &amp; artists from London Theatres 
 Saturday 16 A day in London. At Shaftesbury Theatre "Il Trovatore" by the Carl Rosa Opera Co. not as good a company as Quinlan. Further hints at going convalescent.
