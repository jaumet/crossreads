 On Tue . we reliev the 15th at Fleur support where we were post on Mon . and Tue . When we arriv we found them huddl up in an old gun pit , as they had been shell out of the dug out on Tue . Fritz drop a shell just outsid and dug up a coupl of dead Indian . All along the track to the trench are thousand of cross . Monday 23rd to Thursday 26th A man is buri just where he drop and a cross put over it and either his shell helmet or a shell put there as a land mark . The ground is strewn with shell , rifl , bayonet overturn gun equip etc . But it is useless to tri and describ thing here . Sometim as we are struggl along with a stretcher case , a star shell will light up and the wood cross and dead bodi lie around make thing look veri weird . In spite of it all our crowd are keep up heart wonder and although the humour is veri grim , we can still manag to rais a smile . On Tuesday I got a veri pleasant surpris by get 2 letter and 2 paper from Franc which were mighti welcom . Poor old Mac is in a bad way becaus two of his patient have die on the way in . Thing are mighti rough for us , but how the poor devil of Infantrymen stick it is beyond me . There are about 20 of our men sick and suffer from Shell shock . It is an aw strain on all of us . Doherti fell in a shell hole and roll on a dead German and has felt veri queer ever sinc . On Wed . night besid Serg . Robert and 8 of us bearer we had Capt . Nanc , Irving and a new offic in our dug out and it was veri crowd . We are work in 6 hour shift . 600 went on from 2.30 till 8.30 then we roll in our blanket and tri to sleep sit up but it was a dismal failur as it was so odd and Billsi , Snowi S.H. and I are 1 parti and Mac Bert Hunt , Bluey Riley and Jack Keen are the other . Berri is in charg of the other 2 parti in the next dug out . It look veri funni the crowd wrap in their blanket huddl in a heap to tri and keep warm .
