<p>29 Thursday<br/>Paid &pound; 2 pound in afternoon, being <strike>paid</strike> 13/0 overpaid &amp; my word it is just the time it was needed too, as there is a rumor to the effect that we are getting 5 days leave from Monday next.<br/>A new Warrant Officer arrived from Harefield Hospital, he seems to be very strict, &amp; it is what's needed here, to cut out the Keystone ways they have here.  Rained during the evening.  All that went on leave Monday last returned.</p>
<p>30 Friday<br/>We have to start &amp; go right through our drill again, so today we again started on elementary squad &amp; section drill.  Owing to the new W.O. things have somewhat changed, such as falling in in five minutes earlier &amp; on a private section parade ground &amp; marching on to the original parade ground.  It was a beautiful day.  Went to Cholderton in evening.</p>
<p>1 July Saturday<br/>Had to go before the board to show reason why I shouldn't pay cost of knife, fork, spoon, but owing to these being unissued I got off.  Playing cards until tea time.  Went down to Tidworth in evening &amp; got some films, later going to the vaudeville at the barracks theatre &amp; my word it was <u>very</u> hot too.</p>
