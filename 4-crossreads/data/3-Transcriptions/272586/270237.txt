Will you give her &amp; Uncle Willy my love when next you see them &amp; I will try &amp; write when afloat. if I'm not to sick &amp; miserable if you have not already sent P.C. you mentioned it would be better to send it to the Herald Office addressed to Stan. They are at present stopping at a boarding house at Turack but will be moving into a furnished cottage shortly. closer to the station. I would have liked to go out there again but theres no hope. now I think I'm just wondering if I can get away tomorrow to have my teeth fitted lets hope for the best.</p>
