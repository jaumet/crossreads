past at a gallop. In the afternoon we held bathing parades. A Y.M.C A tent erected proved a great boon to the troops and I arranged for cocoa c to be on for the men after dark. Doc. Simmonds came in to mess and we had a good chin wag with him. The evening is sultry but very peaceful and our Band is playing. Tales came in of crowds of wounded going thro? from the 3rd Division and of plenty of prisoners. Sgt. B.V. Bridges M.M. who has of late been with the Americans has some funny tales to tell about his experiences there. Walked down to Daours with major Simmonds ? a French village of the usual type winding streets blank walls. Saw Col. James yarned.
