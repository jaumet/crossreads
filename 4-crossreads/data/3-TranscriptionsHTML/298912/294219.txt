<p>Our next move was to view our surroundings. We were situated on the crest of a hill of grass (principally bindy-eyes) overlooking the Southern Railway line &amp; further on  was George's River. Away on our left over the River was Liverpool Camp. Casula Railway Station was visible on the right whilst the main camp lay in front of us. We had a feed on bread &amp; jam for tea &amp; then went to bed. Next morning we did not get up until about 10am &amp; then we sat down all day.  On the following Monday the school opened . Lieut Petchlar was in charge &amp; SSM Dubereley was Chief instructor.Old Serg Ryan from the 16th Signal Troop turned up as an instructor to my surprise. A greater surprise came later when TSM Clarke put in an appearance. We are like two like poles of a magnet that is we repel one another. On the opening of the school we naturally had to start at the very beginning-</p>
