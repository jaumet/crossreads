25th April 1915.  Off at last. For the last two days transports have been slipping out one by one, and occasionally passing near enough for us to give them a cheer, and by now no doubt the invasion of Turkey has begun. Amongst the last few come ourselves, and we are wondering what will be left for us to do. Somewhere on the southern portion of Gallipoli we are to land, and I expect in an hour or so, we will be told exactly what we are to do. Meanwhile we have been lectured & lectured as to what we are to do, in what order we are to land, and particularly how careful we are to be of tucker & water, for once ashore we may get nothing for a week. Everybody is exchanging addresses, and cotton wool has been issued to save the concussion of the big guns, for if we go into action immediately it means that the guns of the fleet will be thundering overhead until we almost reach the enemies trenches.
