<p>18-1-16<br/>Tue 18th<br/>Went out for signalling practice again this morning &amp; led the pack horse out for exercise; This afternoon it was showery again &amp; no parade I went to the 2nd L.H. to try &amp; find my black kit bag but with no success;</p>
<p>I had to hand over the Helio &amp; Stand, also Field glasses to Traill this afternoon as he is going with 3 H.Q.<br/>sigs tomorrow morning with A Troop, A Sqd to some place on the Nile &amp; 35 miles from here, they have to work 3 sig stations, &amp; are on patrol to keep any enemy away as they are afraid they would turn the canal in the Nile, which is quite close &amp; cut off Alexandrias water supply at least that is what we are told</p>
