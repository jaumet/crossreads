Worgret Camp Wareham 3.12.16
My Dear Mother 
I have not done any writing since 3.12.16 I came down here the conditions are very much altered, since the move and I am back with the boys again, my staff job ended when we left Bovington. I was recomended for another job. but did no like it so got one of my mates to relieve me, "Officers Orderly. The work was light enough and the quarters fairly comfortable but I could not make myself like the job so left. I have not been able to go and see Mrs H family yet I was to have gone on four days leave from Bovington but the move, spoilt that. All leave was cancelled some days before we left and since I came down here. I have not asked for any leave. If I have any luck at all I will most likely get another job here, anyway I am going to have a try, if that fails well I'm going to try for leave and then France again There is very little of Interest in a in a camp in England The restrictions are too many and we are fooled about and treated as though we were a lot of irresponsibles, all untrustworthy all incapable of Thinking for ourselves "any way if we are" we Showed the Military authorities that we had an opinion of our own
