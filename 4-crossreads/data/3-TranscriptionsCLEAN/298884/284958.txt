  
 are back once again to the land of sun, sand & flies. 
 Long before we sighted Port Said the familiar neat triangle sails of the Jippy cadamanangs could be seen  in  dotted along the horizon. 
 The splendid break-water showed up clearly. Everybody was on deck to see whatever could be seen. 
 The town showed up at fist like a hazy white blob then as we drew nearer, distinct outlines of streets & buildings kept everybody's eyes  glued  occupied trying to see more. We passed a very old warship which has been stationed in Australian waters.
