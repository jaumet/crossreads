<p>March 30th. Thurs.<br/>Life Belt parade at 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>Sailed out of the harbour at Alex. at the same hour.</p>
<p>Machine Guns with their crew are placed at various places on the deck, and a large gun is also placed at the stern of the ship. These are placed there in case of an attack by submarines.</p>
<p>There are 2,500 troops aboard the "Corsican".</p>
<p>Away on the horizon we could see the outline of battleships. Probably an escort.</p>
<p>The "Transylvania" which left later than us came steaming up behind our ship this evening. It is a much faster boat than ours.</p>
<p>Inoculated this afternoon.</p>
<p>Portholes of the ship are closed and darkened at five o'clock every evening.</p>
<p>The troops on board consist of the 11th and 12th Batts A.I.F. Some R.F.A., R.H.A., Machine Gunners &amp; A.M.C.</p>
<p>Read a book entitled "Egypt" in the "Peeps at Many Lands" it is a splendid books and describes the land we have just left, very well indeed.</p>
<p>Given a copy of "Birdwoods" addresses the troops before their arrival in France. The gist of the matter in the address was a request to act in a chivalrous spirit towards the people of France especially the women folks.</p>
<p>Food on board is very good.</p>
<p>Wearing life belts all day long is not conducive to comfort, especially when one has an arm which has just been inoculated.</p>
<p>There is a fairly rough sea on to-day but it is not much effect on this ship, which seems to glide so.</p>
