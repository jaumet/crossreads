thing and then does not mind in the least if you dont obey them. I met Stacy from Gulgon there, he was down on leave too; and then Tom Harris came down from the Regt, and a brother of Stacy's (I dont know which one) had married and elder sister of Tom - so there you are. Is it not a funny little world! The first afternoon in Cairo I went out to Nasruh to the hospital there but found Sister Davidson had gone to the 31st at Albassia; where this place was. Next morning I went to A.I.F. HQ to see the boss dentist and met Fred Rostron there, and in the afternoon I went to the 31st and saw Sister Davidson also some of the chaps from the Regt in there. The 31st is a Tommy jo  hospital and there are all sorts of horrid regulations about the sisters knowing troopers. They are really not supposed to talk to any body who is not an officer, out side of the hospt, and they cant ask any but officers to their own quarters and if they get leave they have to be  in by 8 PM. They obey most of these orders, bar the one about going about with troopers and because most of them have brothers in the ranks over here.
