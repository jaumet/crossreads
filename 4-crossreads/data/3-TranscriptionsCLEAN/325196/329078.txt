  
 3-1-16 Mon 3rd My absence was not missed again last night; This morning we had a kit inspection, & received some more equipment; Les & Reid had to go on duty at the orderly room for a while at dinner time as both the sigs on duty were away on messages & as the parade was  a mounted one this afternoon, & it was raining a little, I decided to make myself scarce rather than get wet, so I went down to the Billiard room & played billiards all the afternoon, & got back to camp soon after six oclock had a feed of tinned pineapple & put the rest of the evening in writing in the mess room; again my absence was not noticed
