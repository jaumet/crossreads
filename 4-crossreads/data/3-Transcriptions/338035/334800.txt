The Banquetting hall was full of old relics &ndash; armour, spears, banners, guns, etc. and also quaint glass windows.  In it also was the gun carriage on which the remains of Queen Victoria was carried to her grave.<br/>The view from Argyle Tower of the town was splendid &ndash; Princes St. Gardens looking exceptionally well.<br/>Thence to St. Giles Cathedral another imposing building and late to Parliament Houses which are now used as Court of Justice.
