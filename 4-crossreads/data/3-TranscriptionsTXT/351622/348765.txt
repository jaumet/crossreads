13 January 1916 ThurNothing of any importance to report to-day. Went to see a few pals close by in the infantry during the night. On my way home I stopped at one of the Crown & Anchor schools. Lost 3 backing the lucky old Heart.
14 January 1916 FriWent to see Jack Kater QM.S. A long chat with Lieut Taplin. We have a [indecipherable] in the camp which claims a great number of the boys after the days drill is over. Crown & Anchor & two-up schools are to be seen everywhere. There seems to be plenty of money about.
