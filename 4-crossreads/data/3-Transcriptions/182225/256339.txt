<p>AUGUST &nbsp; TUESDAY 8 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. We were out with the signalling class under the English sergeant, &amp; he is a pretty fair teacher. I went into Salisbury in Afternoon &amp; saw Mother, she is going away tomorrow to London, &amp; then on to Edinburgh. Brought an infantry cove back in car with me.</p>
