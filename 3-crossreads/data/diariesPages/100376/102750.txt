The sea is beautifully and calm. The troops on the whole are looking well but there are a big number, mostly Tommies coming into hospital with very high temperatures.

Song Services are being held by the C of E padre and they are being well attended and greatly enjoyed.
All men are to sleep on deck. The weather is very hot. Read Stopford Brookes "History of English Literature". Matches are very scarce on board the ship, food is not plentiful, neither is it well cooked.

Quite a big number of sick in hospital mostly Flue. Arrived in Port Said at eight oclock to-night. Anchored outside the canal.
Oct. 13th
A big number of ships at Port Said. All busily engaged loading or unloading stores. We have also taken on extra stores. Some of the Tommy troops are getting off here.
Left Port Said and sailed down the canal this afternoon. For miles and miles along the banks of the canal troops are camped and there must be millions of tons of stores there also. A huge contrast to what it was like four years ago
