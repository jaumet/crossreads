Have already had a feed of blue plumes. 28-8-17 Great excitement to-day ending in a very narrow escape for me. A huge tree was blown right across the hut I was in smashing it to matchwood but I rose through the debris unscathed. I was the only occupant at the time had the adjutant been there he would certainly have been killed. Our papers & gear were scattered some & it took a couple of hours to clear everything but now we are again safely installed in another hut. It was the closest shave I have yet had.
