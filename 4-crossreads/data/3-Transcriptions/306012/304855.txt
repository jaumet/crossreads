We caught an electric train from Boscotrecase back to Naples and straightway made for a "show" to fill in the evening. We found a Music Hall and after seeing a third rate performance right through, went back to the railway station, had a feed, a sleep, and caught a train at 4 a.m. back to Rome.<br/>After a wash, brushup &amp; breakfast I was ready at 10 a.m. for some sightseeing so went out through the old wall, along the Appian Way to the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the way having a good look at the old Roman baths of Caracalla which are in an excellent state of preservation.  There are ten miles of these catacombs, some being seventy feet below the surface.</p>
