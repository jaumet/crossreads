<p>rations &amp; could buy very little. The march from an Ambulance point of view was disgraceful &amp; reflects badly on the leader General Elliott &ndash; my estimate of men who fell out was 25 per cent &amp; others say 600 men fell out along the whole line. We could only handle the most serious cases &ndash; there were sprained ankles chafes &ndash; men fainting &amp; the worst trouble bad fitting boots. If only a very few of the many curses (dinkum Australian) hurled at the General work out, his lot will not be a happy one. We were supposed to get 10 minutes rest every hour &ndash; he marched us for 3 hours &amp; gave us an hour, we all got cold &amp; stiff &ndash; he then went back looking for his men &amp; found them laying 4 deep in some places. General McKay &amp; other generals inspected as we marched in &amp; if McKay has any good judgement, he must surely have noticed company's missing &amp; how tired &amp; fagged we all were. We rolled in clothes &amp; all &amp; had a jolly good sleep in the Hay among Fowls &amp; they started crowing about 3 am.</p>
