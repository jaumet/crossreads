<p>wire where we lay low in holes for the 20th. Signal, which never came so about 1/2 hour later got orders to return to our own lines about 100 yds back. The fire was terribly fierce. Machine gun &amp; Rifle grenades &amp; shell fire &amp; Fritz lit the place up like day with flares. We waited for a while till fire slackened &amp; then got back . Dumped my gear to make matters easier. All wounded were brought in also some of 1st Div. who had been out 5 &amp; 7 days. Stayed in front line passing ammunition &amp; bombs &amp; firing flares till daylight.</p>
