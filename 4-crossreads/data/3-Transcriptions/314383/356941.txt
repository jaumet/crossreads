<p>the word a heroine in the way she helped us with the people today.  Agha Petros brought along his 50 men whom I am using as an advance guard, Baggage guard &amp; Rear Guard.  Brovey &amp; Scott Olsen are with the Refugees.  Wilson we picked up en route &amp;   is in charge of the convoy.  Kay is with the Rearguard &amp; I am looking after the advance guard with Murphy &amp; Brophy (Can).</p>
<p>We soon discovered that all the available Sgts would have to be placed amongst the people as we have 2 and 3 on each camel &amp; when   no one is looking the strongest throw the weaker ones off in order to have an easier ride.  Smith &amp; Tollen are both very ill.  I almost despair of getting Smith to Bijah alive.</p>
