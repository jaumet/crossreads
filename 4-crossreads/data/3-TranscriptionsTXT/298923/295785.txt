29 April 1918 MondayMoved at 3 A.M.Recrossed the J & attached to Australian Division for a stunt-  We expected to go back for a spell-  My leave further off than ever-  Tonight we go back & start fighting in the morning- fine Limey soil covers everything with white dust men & horses look like millers-Don't worry about me we can't go on for ever & I am fit & well-Love to allYour son Frank
