<p>16rth June 1916</p>
<p>My dear Aunt Fan<br/>Thank you for your letter which I received just before I left Sydney.<br/>I have Robin's address in my note book and will write to him just to see where he is but I don't think there is much chance of us meeting unless I have to go into the Artillery and then we might.<br/>At present I am in the mumps hospital at Abbassia, all the rest of our chaps are camped out in the desert at Tel el Kebir in isolation so I am lucky.<br/>Yesterday five of us and a sister went for a motor drive all round Cairo and had a grand time.<br/>I think I am being sent down to Alexandria for a change of air before going back and as there are two or three of our chaps its good fun.<br/>It is very hot in the day time here but this hospital is very cool; it was the Egyptian Artillery Barracks before the war.<br/>I was very lucky about my mail; got some from home only a week after landing here but dont suppose I will get any more till I get back to the Regiment.<br/>Please give my love to Uncle John and Majorie<br/>Your loving nephew<br/>Robert C. Wilson</p>
