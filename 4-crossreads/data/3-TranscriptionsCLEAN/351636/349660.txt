Dear Mrs. Watts,I called at the War Chest after receiving your letter, and find they consider yours a case for the Lord Mayor's Fund. So I am sending you a form to complete and get signed before a J.P - If you let me know that this has been done, we shall send an urgent letter on your behalf -
I am very sorry about the delay, and wish we had known sooner.
I amYours very trulyM. Booth.
