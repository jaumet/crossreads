<p>Ottawa Camp near Poperinghe Belgium19/10/16  In billets(huts) all day.  Very wet morning teeming with rain and we were glad not to be on the move.  Country looks thoroughly drenched, the many poplars are shedding their leaves and appear under "bare poles".  An extremely flat landscape relieved only by an occasional Flemish windmill.  Many ponds with their characteristic fringe of clipped and pruned pollard willows.  A number of English troops also here.  After breakfast drew up move order covering our advance from here at 5 am tomorrow.  Providing for marches of 45 minutes with 15 minute respites and a halt for lunch 1 1/4 hour.  Stewart and the [I.O?] went on ahead to make a reconnaissance of the road as far as the French border.  Abeele.  In the morning there was nothing doing owing to the rain but after lunch a strict foot inspection took place.  Every man had to wash his feet and then have them inspected by an officer.  Bad corns blisters or other troubles were seen to at once by the M.O. Major Blecker.  The Tommies have a band which played at nightfall and I gave leave to a number of men to go to a picture show up the road.  It was quite dark about 4.30 and the night proved to be a very wet and sloppy one with a piercing cold wind.  Were it not for the duckboards one might easily get lost en route to the latrines.  Today would have been a very wretched day for a long march and we hope the morrow will be better.  Arranged for the men to so carry their water sheets and blankets that they can easily detach and use the former as a cape without the latter becoming wet in the event of our experiencing anything like as tempestuous weather conditions as obtained today.</p>
