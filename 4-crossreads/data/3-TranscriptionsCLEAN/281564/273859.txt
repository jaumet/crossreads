  
 Wednesday 9th Sept. During the night we ran into Rossel Island on the SE tip of New Guinea. At 10 oclock the :Australia" (which has been due to meet us every hour since we departed from Sydney.) came in from the N.E. After tacking about the island all day we again set sail (NW by N) - a fleet of thirteen composed of the Battlecruiser "Australia", the cruisers "Sydney" "Encounter, T.P. Ds '  "Warrego","Yarra" & (God bless a civilised name) "Parramatta", Submarines AE1& AE2, Troopship "Berrima"( third class cruiser ) storeship "Aorangi", an oil vessel & two colliers. To see us manoeuvring about one would think that we were out to take Japan instead of New Pommern - our rumoured -destination. 
 Chucked out of the cooks galley for working too hard & was forced to return to the ranks. 
 We received some war news today. Not from the "Berrima Daily Rumour" but from H.M.A.S. "Australia". Among the items of interest were 200000 German casualties to date. Russians capture Lemberg. Germans draw in on Paris. Allies lines unbroken, British casualties 1500  Another defeat of German fleet. R.Harris has another bath. Many casualties
