<p>was slight.  The only man hit was one in 5th Bty.;  He was hit with one of our anti-aircraft gun shell cases.  Cut a piece out of his arm, and cut his foot off.  The case was dug up later, it contained the piece of flesh, also a piece of leggin,  boot, sock and leg.  One shell landed on a stack of harness in 6th Bty's lines.  It was plastered on the sky.  These shells make a hole about 16 feet across and about 10 feet deep.  All the ground about here is soft.  Major O'Gorman V.O. on leave.  More ammunition going to Bty.  Hun plane over at 2 a.m. firing his machine gun.</p>
<p>8-5-1917<br/>Raining all night;  cleared up at 1 p.m.  Plenty of mud again.  Capt. Lucas V.O. attached to Bty.  Very quiet day.  Rumoured that we move in a day or so.  Bit of a stunt on 6 p.m.  Too foggy and misty for aeroplanes and baloons.  Huns got one of our dumps last night, 6 in. Naval ammunition.</p>
