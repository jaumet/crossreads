Sunday 26 September, 1915
Went to church & Holy Communion.
Two friends of Bernie Morris came up in the evening.
I received G'burn papers. They were very welcome and I did not know what to do with myself so I had a good long read of G'burn news.
Today specially in the afternoon, has been the quietest that I can remember, it was just like a Sunday afternoon at home.
