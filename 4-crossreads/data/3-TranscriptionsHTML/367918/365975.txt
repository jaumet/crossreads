<p>Australian Hdqrs<br/>Cairo<br/>4.3.19</p>
<p>My dear Judge,<br/>I seem to have dropped into another soft berth. As you see I am now at Aust Hdqrs. The job at Descorps petered out when the DDMS Descorps who was also DDMS AIF in Egypt, decided to devote his time to the latter work exclusively. Then I came down here with him and am now doing a job of work in connection with war records.</p>
<p>It was only in the beginning of 1918 that it was suddenly realised that when the War ended some one would have to amuse himself writing a history of the show &amp; that in all probability technical histories of each department would have to be written. Up to that time everyone who had to keep a war diary regarded it as so much hot air that would receive no better treatment than ultimate condemnation to the W.P.B. Consequently they are all useless things containing in the main such entries as "Nothing to record" etc.</p>
<p>Now, of course, all these have to be gone through and completed as far as possible in every detail. In most cases the original personnel of the unit are scattered to the four winds and it is difficult to find anyone who can supply the required information. Having done that it is even more difficult to persuade them to put pen to paper. It is extraordinary how much objection there is</p>
