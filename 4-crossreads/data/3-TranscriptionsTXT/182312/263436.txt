the contestants are so hemmed in by the sides of the trench that the
bomb produces its maximum effect and soon has the trench or sap
choked with dead and wounded.  It is unnecessary to enter into
details of the xxxxxxxx fighting as these have been so graphically
described in the papers from time to time and are really a repetition
of the same sort of thing which has been going on ever since this

     My term in the front line of the Somme region was six
days, at the end of which I was incapacitated by a bullet through the

more than average, time for a man to last in that inferno where you
were often cut off from food and ammunition supplies and had no means
of communicatiing with the outside world other than by pigeons.  Not
only the front lines but the whole terrain in the rear lie under such
