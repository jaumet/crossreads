for you own comfort, convenience & happiness & don't let any expense stand in your way.  It doesn't matter if we go broke we will soon be able to put the pieces together again when we get together again.     Those damned chaps Norris & Harris - getting all those frills & furbelows from you - I would like to kick the pair of them.   I very rarely touch any greens here - they look very nice - but I have seen them being washed in the canals en route to market & in Egypt canals & sewers are practically one & the same thing.   We get plenty of London papers here - I have just been reading the Daily Mirror of 24th March - we also get the London illustrated weeklies - the war pictures are very interesting.   I will keep a look out for both Oatley & Somerville - I have not seen Uncle Joe for some time but intend looking him up first opportunity.  I can well imagine the horror of your last few days on the Demosthenes however it is all over now thank God & I am proud of my brave little wife.Don't worry about my socks I can darn splendidly & spent about two hours at the job a few days ago.   I have not since worn the socks but they look fine.    The only difficulty I experienced was threading the rope through the microscopic slit at the non business end of the needle.
