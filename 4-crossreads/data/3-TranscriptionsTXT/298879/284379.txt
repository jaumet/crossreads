May 1915Saturday 22Wet.   Trenches very muddyEnemy throwing large bombs but did no damage. Fairly quiet otherwise. The explosion from this bomb is something like that from our "Japanese Bomb".
Sunday 23Fine Beautiful peaceful day. Just an occasional crack from a sniper to break the silence. Officers from the enemy parleying for a truce to bury dead. In the afternoon the enemies guns got busy & wounded three of our chaps. I went to hospital today feeling done up, been going for a month with nerves strung.
