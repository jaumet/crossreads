The dinner was first rate, after which I did the town & went into a picture show, returning to the billet where I shaved etc in readiness for the morning, the boat going about 9 oclock. 
 Thursday 28th Nov  up at 6 with severe pain, something in last nights dinner upsetting me.  Had breakfast & then went off to the boat which sailed at 9.30.  Bumped a tommy Sgt Major through wanting to stay up on deck, neither won.  Reached Folkestone after a quick trip about midday & Horseferry road at 2.30.  From here took a taxi to Southampton Row but could not book a room at the West Central but managed to at the Premier Hotel 4/6 rooms now being 6/6, however I had no time to look for better,  then rushed off to L.M & Co to draw some money after
