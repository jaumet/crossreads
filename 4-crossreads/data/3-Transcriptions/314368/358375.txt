<p>Somme front knocked a good deal of my old enthusiasm out, but you may be sure when the time comes that I will go over once more with the best of spirits, for there will be peace for none of us until the whole thing is over and utterly crushed. Even here in England the Germans are beginning to cause trouble with their air raids, and I think that it is only right that some of our flying chaps should give him a taste of what the English towns are getting. I have been down in Northampton several times, but it is not a very interesting place, it is a fairly large town but entirely manufacturing, boots are the chief manufacture and in consequence almost everyone is employed in the factories during the day and the town is not very lively. I sent along a few photos that I had taken here at the hospital a week or so ago. I hope you get them all right. I have had some more taken and will send them along as soon as they turn up. I received the money all right. Thank you mother I had no trouble in getting it from the bank in London, &amp;</p>
