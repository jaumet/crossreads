Monday 8 October 1917.
Bringing up supplies from Rafa. Got a little bushed as night came on before we got in sight of Aerodrome on return. Struck an outpost & he put us on our track & supplies were got through safely.
On return delighted to find another Australian mail (direct) 8 letters & packet of local papers.
One of our battle planes brought down a Taube this morning.
Geo. S.S. Cameron back from Marakeb beach with Archie Scott.
