My Dear SisterJust received your letter dated new Years Day. I thought you had forgotten me altogether. I did not go to say goodbye the second time because I thought it best not to, seeing the state you were in. What I did was in my opinion the best thing to do under the circumstances so please don't think it was neglect on my part. So pleased to hear that you are getting on well again. Laurel told me all about baby, said it was the image of that baby photo of you. She must be a little beauty. Tell Nita that I hope the 3 they worried about will come in handy to buy some safety pins for her's.
