<p>England<br/>25.2.18</p>
<p>Dear Dad<br/>At last after a long silence, another letter has arrived from you dated 19.12.17.  It was the first for over two months and thereby, Webster once more has earned my undying gratitude.  I was pleased to see by your letter that the Xmas cards &amp; letters arrived O.K.  We were under the impression that the home-going Xmas mail had been sunk.</p>
<p>Many thanks for congratulations re promotion.  It's true I never had a helping hand to get where I am now and I intend to go much further yet.  I have not yet heard from you whether you received my medal or not.  I will wait till I receive your reply and if it has not then arrived will make enquiries, as I value it some.</p>
<p>A very fine parcel arrived two days ago from you, I thank you very much.  The contents were well chosen and the inclusion of sugar</p>
