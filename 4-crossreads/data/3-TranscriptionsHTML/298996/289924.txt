<p>tired of counting any more, all were shrapnel I saw Grant [indecipherable] this afternoon &amp; had a good talk with him shrapnel was falling all around us in the trenches. Our Howitzers were pumping huge explosives into the Turks which shifted a few yards of dirt &amp; a few Turks also<br/>Fresh meat Tobacco issue</p>
<p>11-7-15<br/>About 10 0clock this morning one of our batterys were fired a few rounds, at the Turks artillery &amp; they returned same the shrapnel shells from them stirrerd our boys up &amp; Re made them move further down nobody got hit. One of our Aeroplanes was up this afternoon it was all white except the red bulls eyes as a distinguishing mark it did <strike>d</strike> look pretty they had a few shots at it but <strike>sid</strike> went wide. About five oclock this evening one of our Crusiers was shelling the Turks Same was firing 6 shots at a time (broadside). Six Dainty destroyers wer guarding her. She was firing for about 50 shots. Church service</p>
<p>12-7-15<br/>Nothing doing other than watching shrapnel bursting near by this morning. This afternoon one of our Aeroplanes was flying over the Turk line whom had a few shots at her, very bad shooting for gunners. Cpl Penthy went away this evening to Lemons Iland for a spell. The Turks had a few shots at one of our small food transports but went wide. Aslo at one of our destroyers this time going near, she steamed away and surcled around &amp; wipped a few more shots at the turks.</p>
<p>13-7-15<br/>We went out to do some work last night but did not do much as there was very little to do, of course the boys did not grumble I went out exploring for Curious &amp; found a Turks boot or shoe and intend to send same home, while doing so two shrapnel shells burst overhead. Of course we bolded, Edie eden was with me. This afternoon we went for water we waited 3 hours before we got same. There was a [indecipherable] last night our crowd was trying to draw the Turks artillery fire but failed it was bedlam let loose while it lasted. There are 500 <strike>marie</strike> Maori troops here. They are fine stamps of men &amp; fine fellows [indecipherable]</p>
