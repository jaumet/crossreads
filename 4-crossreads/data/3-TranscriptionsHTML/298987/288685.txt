<p>Much as usual. Tucker improved grilled chops replaced our old friend Stew for breakfast. A lecture by an RFC Lieutenant on Flying Machines &amp; Flying very interesting Physical Drill class got going properly again</p>
<p>Wednesday 15th<br/>Much cooler Awnings all taken down again. The ventilator has also been taken out makes it much hotter at night. Have tried to get it put in again but no one seems to care enough about it to do anything<br/>The Cruiser caused some excitement today. She was about 3 miles away to Port when she suddenly started fireing &amp; manuvering at top speed We could see what she was fireing at &amp; most thought it was a target the more imaginitave swore it was a Sub. Some could even see the oil on the water where it sunk. Several chaps have moved there hammocks</p>
