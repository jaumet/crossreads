  
 Sep 3rd at 6 AM we commenced shovelling in the celebrated black diamonds from the S.S. "Katoa" approximately 700 tons, and during the forenoon to our pleasant surprise the troopship "Moeraki" escorted by the cruiser "Pyramus" arrived in harbour from Apia conveying the "Governor" and about 200 prisoners of war from that place,-  naturally coaling our ship progressed rather slowly, as "Moeraki" with her prisoners of war was the centre of attraction,-  well we eventually completed with coal by 7 P.M., - the collier then moved away and we washed down the ship and prepared everything for action again and ere long we were again in readiness to proceed, awaiting orders; -meanwhile our boys were availing themselves of the opportunity to take in a good supply of fruit, that the natives were selling as fast as they could bring it alongside, or inboard, until we had every appearance of being a banana ship than a ship of war, nevertheless fruit is thoroughly appreciated by all in tropical climes
