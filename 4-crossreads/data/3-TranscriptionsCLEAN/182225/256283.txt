JUNE   TUESDAY 13   1916
Very misty in morning but when it lifted it was a perfect day. We (27th Bat) all went ashore, the rest of the brigade it was optional whether they went or not, but a lot went. They were all in full marching order except for overcoats. We were taken off about 10.30 AM in a lighter & a tug (Sir Charles Elliott). We got ashore about 11 AM & the brigade marched out to Sea Point about 2 miles out, and they were dissmissed at 1 pm till 3.45 when they had to be out at the wharf. Bill Hunter & self & Farrier Seagent Armstrong ([Beda's/Bedd's?] husband) got off as soon as we landed to get some neatsfoot oil We got it easily & went to the Grand Hotel grill room & had lunch then went out to Cecil Rhodes old home. Its a beautiful
