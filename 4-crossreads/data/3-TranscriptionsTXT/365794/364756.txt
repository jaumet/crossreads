 Tuesday 18 December 1917 Day off, breakfast in bed 9 a.m., bath &amp; town 11 a.m., bought rug at Club (Pt. 115). Abandoned by Miss Hughes 1.15 p.m. so went Barrage (alone) as alas am generally forced to do at length.  Pretty misty day, heavy rain at intervals &ndash; &frac12; hour brings one to Barrage station after a quick trip through flat green fields all I imagine watered by canals from the old Nile.  Very interesting &amp; pictures truly biblical all the way.  Men driving oxen in the plough, a shepherd walking in front of his flock &amp; calling them on to follow, etc. Rode on trolly to tea, gardens after tea, roamed through lovely gardens, admired old Nile (not any English person to speak to).  Back in Cairo 6.30, 27th 6.30 p.m.
