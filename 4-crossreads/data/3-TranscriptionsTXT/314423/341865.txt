Ancient Westminster Hall was also inspected. Here the trial of Charles I was held and a brass plate marks the spot where the King sat. The body of Edward VII lay in state in this Hall. From here we were driven to Buckingham Palace and places of interest pointed out on the way. We were shown over the King's Stables, this being the second time I have visited the stables on this leave. &ndash; We were then driven back to the Club passing the United States Embesey, and their Naval offices. We also passed the Duke of Wellingtons house, Lord Rothschild's  house which had the blinds drawn for Saturday is his Sunday. It was about 4.20 when we returned, and had a very pleasant trip for 3/-.
