After marching for bout two hours we pass through the famous town of Peronne, of course it was just a mass of ruins.  Some terrible fighting took place in this town, whilst I was in England. Shortly after leaving Peronne we were in country that Fritz occupied only the day before. You can see by this that we were close on his heels. About mid-day we arrived at the village of Mons en Cheausee & to our surprise found our Unit running an Advanced Dressing Station there. At one time it has been a German Hospital, so of course it was just the thing for a Dressing Station. Here we obtained a bath & a good hot meal & at 6:45 p.m. the Bearers fall in again & are conveyed in motor buses to the different Infantry Battalions of our Brigade. Arrived at the Battalion that my squad was appointed to at 7:30 & sleep amongst some trees for the night.

After walking about 8 miles we get settled down & lived in some old German dugouts for a few days. We had a very easy time, all I did was to eat, sleep & write letters for three days. What do you think of our meals, given to the troops, whilst in the Line?
