 [indecipherable], have been here about three days. June 2nd 17 Still in camp here. We are supposed to be in training for a long route march, expect to be leaving this part of the line very shortly. The country is very beautifull again. Yesterday we went through Stere au Flos, Baraste, &amp; Haplnicourt The ground in places looked like a beautiful carpet. June 6th 17 Still in Camp On the night of the 4th an enemy aeroplane  filed  flew over the camp and dropped a bomb it just missed the lines by about a dozen yds, it dropped about 20 yds from me, expecting others to be dropped, it caused a great deal of commotion &amp; nearly everyone ran out of the camp to the open ground, however he flew off, being afraid of the anti-air craft guns. There were five casualties three very slight, two were admitted to hospital. This morning the brigade has been on a long route march, was very fortunate on duty at phone.
