  
 In the days that are to come 
 We've left our dear old homeland, Our parents, sweethearts, all, We could not stay while every day, Would see our comrades fall The glorious ambition, Which spares not friend or foe Has dared our might, so now to fight Australians all, we go 
 Ch. So farewell my sunny land And farewell love to you On land or sea, it seems to me I see your eyes of blue. But though my country claims my heart And lives maybe of some There's a happy day not far away In the days that are to come 
 There's times when hearts are burdened And fortune seems unkind And memorys bring a cruel sting To every anxious mind "Tis you who fight the battle Who watch and wait and pray And so for you we'll dare & do Until the happy day.
