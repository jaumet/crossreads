<p>4.12.15<br/>Sat 4th<br/>Last night Francis &amp; I went down to the beach &amp; brought back a piece of hardwood that had been washed ashore, it was as much as we could carry &amp; will keep us in firewood for a week or two; a Turkish spy dressed as an Indian &amp; went from camp to camp haircutting for some months past was arrested &amp; found guilty and shot a few days ago; This afternoon 7 warboats opened up to the south of us &amp; it was the heaviest bombardment I have yet heard, the seven boats firing broadsides making one continuous roar while the bombardment lasted; some gun off the warboats which were landed &amp; are now dug in along the beach blew the top off Snipers Nest this afternoon; The 17th Seige Battery done the job, otherwise all quiet &amp; warm</p>
