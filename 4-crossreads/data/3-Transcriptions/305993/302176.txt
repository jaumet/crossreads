<p>4.3.19<br/>Fine weather prevailed &amp; every one enjoying the change from camp life.  Deck quoits, cricket &amp; all kind of games.  The Tommies playing house for pennies &amp; enjoying themselves throughly.  At 10 a.m. we passed Phassa Is.

<p>5.3.19<br/>Fine weather still prevails.  At 10 a.m. we met the Huntspil troop ship bound from Taranto to Salonika, having one her officers on board as passengers.  We signalled by semaphore &amp; told them if they stopped &amp; lowered a boat we would stop also &amp; send their 3rd officer away.  Consequently we both stopped, they sent a boat over &amp; took their officer back with them.  This delayed us &frac12; an hour.  We are steaming under 2 less boilers &amp; reduced speed of 13&frac12; knots as we are short of coal.  At 8 p.m. a concert was held on board in which hundreds joined in in the 2nd Saloon &amp; proved to be a good one &amp; a success.</p>
<p>6.3.19<br/>At 7 a.m. we passed through the barrage of mines &amp; nets &amp; dropped anchor in the outer harbor.  Throughout the trip we received wireless calls re floating mines some near of our track which still makes the passage dangerous.  At 8 a.m. we passed through the Bridge into the Inner harbor in charge of a pilot &amp; anchored &frac12; a mile off the shore near the British Camp.  The Inner harbor still full of large &amp; small warships.  British, French &amp; Italian &amp; the British Warship Queen still moored here.  At 9 a.m. we commenced to disembark &amp; at noon 2500 troops, officers, sisters &amp; men</p>
