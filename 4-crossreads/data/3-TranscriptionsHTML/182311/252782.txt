<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A patrolling biplane very obligingly &quot;looped the loop&quot; above the crowd, several times, and earned the approval of our boys.&nbsp; The biplanes are seen here quite often and also in quantities for one morning I observed sixteen of them rising above the Royal Flying School at Netheravon, they seem to fly away all over the country on their tests and may be seen again flying overhead in the evening, their heads turned like homing birds in the direction of Netheravon.</p>
