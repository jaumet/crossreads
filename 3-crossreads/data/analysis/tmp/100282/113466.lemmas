I expect the offic who put them under arrest hate do it , but he had to do it so the chain goe on , it not all beer skittl be in charg of men . If ever a chap felt homesick well I did today , make a chap think of Australia when the sun is shine nice even the bird were sing as they were here today , put me in mind of happi day I had spent in Tasmania New South Wale , when I had not a care in the world , my ambit was to own land see the world , in fanci I could see the old " Coal River " , with it "weep willow " trail over the clear old river the trout "rise " in the quiet pool which were half hidden by tea tree wattl clemati , oh the scent of it all , it stick in my nostril yet , then I was in New South Wale on my poni out on the "run " look round the fenc stock etc , the sun was nice hot , in the even as I rode home
