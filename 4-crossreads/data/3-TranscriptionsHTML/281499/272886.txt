<p>the smell of <strike>of</strike> an oily rag.<br/>Well we went up this afternoon I took 24 men with me, &amp; we got sopping soaking wet, we only worked about an hour &amp; down she come by the time we reached our dugouts" &amp; by the way we felt so disgusted &amp; miserable that we walked over the top &amp; in full view of the Hun guns for nearly a mile, did not care if we stopped one or not, arrived at our dugouts expecting to find them fairly dry but no we found about 2 ft of water in it &amp; half the dugouts fallen in &amp; us wet to the skin &amp; nothing dry to change into, all our blankets &amp; overcoats sopping a pretty state of affairs, &amp; you may not believe it judging by the writing &amp; the book but I am at this present moment cold as ice wet to the skin, &amp; no dry clothes, &amp; as hungry as a hawk enough to kill any man &amp; nearly every Australian is in the same mess to-night <strike>of</strike> on this famous "Somme"</p>
