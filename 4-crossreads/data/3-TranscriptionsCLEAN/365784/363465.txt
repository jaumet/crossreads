  
 P.S. 
 I was talking to a civilian here today & he said the Red Cross Committee cannot think in thousands & told me that he had applied for pipes & tobacco for several hundred men & they sent 7 (seven) pipes & tobacco for the same! & one military man told me that he applied for cigarettes for 600 wounded & they sent 200 cigarettes - 1 for every 3 men! 
 If it were not so tragic it would be comic. I understand that the British & Australian Red Cross have amalgamated. We hear that our ambulances (which are the only motor ambulances in Egypt) are taking Turkish prisoners for drives - yet our wounded can't get out for drives unless some charitable person gives them an outing & there are so few British residents here now - practically no women & children & so there are very few British helpers.
