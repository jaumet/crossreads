<p>close on sixty pounds.<br/>Well I expect you have heard the news of H.M.A.S. Sydney &amp; her smart bit of work in regards the Emden. I can tell you we were in range of the trouble &amp; things were very exciting while things lasted I may say that it means a Bar for us being in action the first we have had so far. little did we expect a naval medal.<br/>We are now nearing Colombo having passed the line yesterday &amp; I can tell you I will remember it to my last days.

The Officers formed a Tin Can Band &amp; played all round the ship making a great bedlam &amp; causing no end of fun. They also played Father Neptune &amp; his Queen &amp; attendents to his throne which was on a platform</p>
