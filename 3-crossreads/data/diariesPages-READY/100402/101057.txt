Monday 15 April
Move again to the northern outskirts of Hazebrouck where we are in very good billets.
Fritz is shelling round about causing much consternation among the remainder of the poor civilians who still persist in clinging to their homes. Good God it is pitiful to see them!!
Two casualties to Ambulance, Gleeson died of wounds, Clareson wounded. Yesterday the Bosche attacked our front, with all his transport following closely behind his infantry expecting an easy break through. What a shock he received!! Our M.G's simply mowed him down at 100 yards range scattered his transport in all directions. He evinced great surprise on meeting Australians, so two prisoners taken. To our brigade about 1000 Tommy stragglers are attached.
Tuesday 16 April
Our people are to attack to-night in conjunction with the French. We have been sent up to A.D.S. at Borre as reserve bearers. Quiet just now. Rumour has it that Fritz has driven the British back to a kilo from Ypres and captured nine hundred guns. Of course we, the 1st, are the only Australian Division on this front.
