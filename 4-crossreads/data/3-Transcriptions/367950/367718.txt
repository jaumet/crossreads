<p>14th December 1916, Gererat 1916 Thursday</p>
<p>Our planes very active this morning Mercer bought into camp an unexploded German bomb when returning from outpost duty last night. The most foolish thing he could do I think! It is highly dangerous to meddle with it. I took measurements of it and several men photographed it and then it was given a military funeral with all honours.<br/>(Then follows a drawing of the bomb with total length being shown as 59 cm. The top portion is marked HANDLE and the next section, shown as being 4 &frac12; cm, is marked &ndash; metal collar or guide for keeping the bomb upright. The next section is shown as 15 cm and is marked &ndash; Pear Shaped Bomb. The drawing is continued on the next page.)</p>
