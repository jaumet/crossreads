 [Notes] Craigs comment on the Retreat and the long way we have to march to reach our Mametz huts: - "The back is getting so far away from the front" At Alexandria it was favourite sport for the men to throw pennies from the boat deck and watch the crowd of natives scramble and fight for them.  An English officer was much amused and vented frequently his most peculiar cackling laugh.  Two chaps were regarding him curiously and on another explosion one remarked "Blime Bill, he's laid another egg" Inspections on coming out of the line found many greatcoats cut down.  General Birdwood at medal presentation wore a very short "warm".  Remarked one "Us poor blokes get charged up 35/- and 'eres old Birdie with a cut down coat so short is waist does him fer a collar!" Pay - Please is my name entered on the 'equipment' roll Denis Deasy:  CO. "Pte Deasy I'm going to make you shoemaker Sgt. D: "[indecipherable] Yes, Shoemaker Yes. Sergeant, I dunno!' Food &ndash; Army biscuit now known as 'Anzac wafer' On Thursday there is no jam or butter as there is an issue of dry fruit in lieu.  It is known as Black Thursday. Tea &ndash; Billjim: - 'Tea d'ye call it. It's so thin I could shave through it. Tea, why &hellip;it's innocent water scalded to death'
