Fine & warm. We got off the "Anchises"
into the ferry at 10 AM & went to
Wooloomooloo Wharfe & from there
in Red X cars to the barracks. Met
Linda, Mr Lloyd, Mum & Dad there
& then I got fixed up & discharged
straight away. All had lunch at
Carnavon & then yarned. Linda
& I went on to "The Terraces" after
& saw Mrs Lloyd & then on to the
Barracks & got my kit & came
over to "Lisheen" with it. I stayed
here & its just like old times.
Linda & I went down to our
lookout after dinner. Its just
too good for words to be
back once more.
