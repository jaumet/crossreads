Drill order only with camels before breakfast. Posted Registered Parcel to Mother.
Received "Table Talk" from Joy this afternoon.
Had snap taken on camel this afternoon.
After feeding parade went to Cairo & got photographic material for taking "up the line".
Tonight the light saving action came into force & it makes a difference to Cairo city.
