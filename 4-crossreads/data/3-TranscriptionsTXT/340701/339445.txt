 24-12-16 Luden called on me today &amp; told me that Bob was practically blown to pieces by a Shell on the Sunken Rd. near Flers.  He was taken to the dressing station &amp; died there or on the way.  Luden wrote &amp; told [indecipherable] Ciss that he died of wounds.  A most mercifull way of putting it.  Bob had fits on several occasions (4) &amp; could have got out of it if he liked but wanted to leave with a few stripes. Some W.O. in the N.R. kept asking if he had got any. 
  Xmas Day  We had a day off today.  Two Beer issues.  One Pudding to the Company which was tossed for and won by No 4 Platoon.  I seen A. Niddrie today.  The 17th  were unlucky enough to be sent up to the line in the afternoon.  Fritz issued some Iron Rations in the afternoon. Boxing Day I put in the morning working on Bobs Grave.
