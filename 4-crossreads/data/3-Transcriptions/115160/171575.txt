<p>Darling Mither,</p>
<p>It is easily three weeks since I had word from you, and I was very pleased to receive a small bundle as we hiy&nbsp;this spot yesterday morning. &nbsp;I was pleased to note that you were all in good health. &nbsp; Poor old Dad, I see, has&nbsp;had a severe shaking with pneumonia, but I was very pleased to see that he was on the mend in the dry air of Coonamble.</p>
<p>We came on here yesterday morning. &nbsp;We had been having a fairly easy time at Bohain altho&#39; the irregularity of the arrival of the train had to be reckoned with. &nbsp;Our French friends were sorry to part with us. &nbsp;There was a very good nightly show run by the 6th Tommy Division which was as good as is knocking around.</p>
<p>This place has been well out of the zone of the fighting, but even so it is well knocked about, and one can see the results of our bombs. &nbsp;All these towns about here are all well knocked about especially those of any military importance. &nbsp;They are all very dull, for it will take a long time for them to resume their ordinary course of things.</p>
