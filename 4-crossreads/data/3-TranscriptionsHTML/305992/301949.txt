<p>We are now four months away from Sydney. Honestly it appears like 2 years with the strain &amp; responsibility. How we all wish that some perfect means could be invented to locate &amp; destroy these submarines. It gets on ones nerves. Dozens of Hydroplanes flying over us every day making a thundering noise. Battleships cruisers destroyers sloops submarines &amp; troopships. The huge cost to be paid by the public after the war. Life in Europe after the war will be a burden. The sensiable working man will emigrate to the Colonies later as the taxation will be enormous.<br/>Four months away from Australia 97&percnt; of the crew have received no letters &amp; all are very disappointed. May be through ships being torpedoed as all our Sydney mail come via London G.P.O.</p>
