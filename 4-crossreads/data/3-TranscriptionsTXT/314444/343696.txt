Aeroplane. The pieces of iron & stell steel are from the shell when it bursts. one of those exploded within eight yds of me.I am glad Mrs Ward recieved my letter. I have posted some to her old address since she has left. The last day I had in London I was rowing on the river & somebody shouted Tom. Who do you think it was Bennett (L. Horse) & Keller (you met him at the Bay Arthurs friend also Normas Lethbridge friend) Have not seen Norman Lethbridge or any body else since I left.Must go & do a bit nowHoping you are all well.Best wishes & heaps of loveYour loving SonTom
