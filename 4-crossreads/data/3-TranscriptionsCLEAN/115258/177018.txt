went into details rather much, but as it was such a successful stunt and seems as if it will be the last, at least for some time, I thought I might as well tell you all about it. I am writing this in the evening in the YMCA and its terribly hot and I'm hurrying to get outside into the cool again; hense this hurridly dashed off note. Got a long letter from Hal the other day, which I'll answer in due course; if I can get any news to tell him. Am reading a jolly interesting book here "Music of the Wild" by Gene Stratton Porter. I would like to get her illustrated copy of it. Well I must stop. Love to Father, Mother & Hal. Do you miss Bessie very much?
