<p>Fine &amp; very heavy frost, which lasted all day. We turned out at 4.30 AM &amp; moved off at 7 AM to do our third shoot. We did very well &amp; the drivers were very good &amp; the best in the brigade. Cleaning harness ect in the afternoon. Bunny Bundock &amp; Reg Watt &amp; Frank Shepherd came up to see me. They had just come over from Parkhouse</p>
