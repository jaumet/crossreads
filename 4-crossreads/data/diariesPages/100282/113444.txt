he was sent on liason patrol, or otherwise a connecting patrol, a mere nothing, but he squibbed it, went back reported all correct, his officer had his suspicions so he questioned him eventually put him under arrest he got a severe reprimand a great lecture. He won't last long his platoon have no time for him, once that happens good-bye, it was his first time in the line he made a sorry mess of it. 
12th. Up to the line again tonight or rather early this morning, we rose at 3 oclock had breakfast moved off at 4 we reached the line in no time took over, things were very quiet coming in scarce a shot being fired by Fritz, I had charge of the "fighting patrol" again Jimmy Lynch was with me, but we done nothing the first night, too wet dark.
13th. Very quiet scarce a shot fired wonder what old Fritz is up to, I expect a new mob is in.
