<p>Wednesday 13 Sept. 1916<br/>Again wet &amp; miserable. The new brigade was taking over during the day but I did not bother much, feeling off colour &amp; lying down most of the time. About 8.30 at night set off with Cuthbert from H.Q. &amp; walked along the railway line, being just in time to catch the train, which fortunately was 15 minutes late. Only a very short run in it &amp; then a march of abt. 3 mls. to 2nd Bn. H.Q. where we had a cup of tea &amp; then came on the other 1 &frac12; miles to our old Bde. H.Q., arriving cold &amp; tired at a late hour. Bert Thompson called to see be during the morning.</p>
