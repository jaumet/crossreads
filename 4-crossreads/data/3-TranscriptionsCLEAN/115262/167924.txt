Wednesday 6 June 1917.
At sea and now at 2 pm we are 1 days sail from Colombo. Fersh foodstuffs at Canteen are much dearer now. At 1.30 pm a boat sighted on horizon. 
Gazetted Corporal as from 3/6/17 in Ships Orders for voyage only. Put up 2 stripes this morning.
Fire started in the ships coal bumkers at 2.15 pm, and continued so until night and at 9.30 a ship on horzon was ordered to stand by in case of emergency and as the ships officers could not locate fire at all. Everything was in readiness and ships officers stood by all night. A little excitement. ("Our first fire at sea".)
