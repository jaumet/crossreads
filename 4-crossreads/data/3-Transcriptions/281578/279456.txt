<p>Bn band dispensed some very nice music. It is an excellent band &amp; played catchy, up to date music, instead of all regimental marching stuff. It was very enjoyable, they played "Yaaka Hula," "Tonight's the night", "The Girl in the Taxi," &amp; other pieces. We had an easy afternoon, short arm inspection by the M.O., the quickest I've ever seen in the army; instead of filing past him, we stood in line out in the wind, "presented arms" &amp; he walked along. Aubrey arrived here yesterday some hours after us, he &amp; a party were looking to the rations, I was put in D Coy, &amp; he is in B. He has had to take down his 3 stripes now he has joined the Bn. In a way I am glad as he is too conscientious for an N.C.O., &amp; was continually running about for others; now he won't have the chance to. I had a yarn to him &amp; some of our chaps after tea, they are in tents, but it was so bitterly cold &amp; airy there, that I soon came back to our warm shed. The big gun fired several shots in the evening, it is in the hollow near us &amp; is 5 miles behind our trenches. The chaps from the line are all writing a lot of letters now they have the chance. I am a section commander, &amp; it's not all beer &amp; skittles; issued the rations</p>
