16/5/18 Montigny
Went for a walk after breakfast and soon threw myself down on a grassy bank for the day was as hot as an Australian summer's day. Passing traffic sent up clouds of white dust on all the roads around. A German aeroplane flew leisurely overhead and archies and machine guns fired wildly at it. Later in the day one was crashed by our airmen. Snowden brought my horse around after lunch and I rode into Franvillers first calling at the Transport Lines. Our Orderly Room Sergeant (Cox) amuses me with his wholehearted zeal for his work. Rode along the main Albert road which is under direct observation in parts. There was plenty of traffic (motor and other) and batteries are emplaced all along. Camouflaged piles of shells are stacked by the roadside. Turned in towards Ribemont on a side track and located our cooks who salvaged a milch cow. Galloped along over pleasant grassland until I came to a high tree covered bank or cliff where 2 of our companies had dug themselves in and were not only comfortable but safe to boot. Walked from here across to Battn H.Q. and things were so quiet and tranquil one would never know there was a War on. Saw them all there and promoted some N.C.O.S. Also made
