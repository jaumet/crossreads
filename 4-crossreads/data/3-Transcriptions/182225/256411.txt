<p>Fine &amp; warm. The 3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;Division Artillary went out &amp; did some work as a division but I believe it was not up to much. I was on ration fatigue with Bill Hunter but went out for a ride as horse holder to Col Richards as he made his inspection of the camps. Went &amp; had a look at the concert (9AMC) in YMCA at night. I forwarded 5 papers 3 letters &amp; a parcel on to Poss.</p>
