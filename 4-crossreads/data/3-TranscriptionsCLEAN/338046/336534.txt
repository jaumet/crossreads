We met a couple of new reinforcements, who had been on the "Ballarat" when she was torpedoed and sunk, off the English coast.   They said that it wasn't bad sport  getting  being taken off in the destroyers, but they lost all except what they stood up in.   They also told us that the photos published, showing them standing on the deck like the heroes of the Birkenhead were all tommy rot, as they had been taken a fortnight previously, while the men were at boat drill.   We trailed home at dusk. Our training at this time consisted mainly of "stunts" - climbing up the old Roman road at the back of the camp, and running up and down the steep bare hill, in search of an imaginary enemy.   One day we went out to Grovelly wood and had an all day stunt.   The "cookers" - travelling kitchens - came up at dinner
