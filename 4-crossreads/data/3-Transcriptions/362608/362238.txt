<p>we were lucky for one of us to get away so soon, for the  A.A.M.C.is a long way behind the infantry for returning for instance the Infantry are sending home March 1916 men while the A.M.C. are only up to June 1915 so Harry will follow me very soon.<br/>I do not like to leave him but it is his wish for me to go, so my dear people I leave here on 26/3/19 for Fovant that is the A.A.M.C Depot to wait for a boat so my dear all at last thank God you shall  see one of us very soon. Harry comes back from leave on the 25th and I am all packed up so I shall soon be home and  shall tell you all I am really too</p>
