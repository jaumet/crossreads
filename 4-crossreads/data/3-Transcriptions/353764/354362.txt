<p>The Transports are continually arriving.  There are now 19 in the harbour alongside us &amp; more coming in.</p>
<p>20th Dec. 15<br/>Very busy day &amp; still on board.  We disembark to-morrow morning &amp; are getting everything up from the holds in readiness.  Purchased a few sets of views of "Suez", which I will send on.  Expect to be in at Pier at 6.30pm.<br/> Tomorrow, our Campaign Starts.</p>
<p>21.12.15<br/>Left the boat at 9 am &amp; put my feet on Egyptian Soil for an indefinite period.  We had a very busy day &amp; finally got away by 6 pm.  We have &amp; loaded train of 20 carriages &amp; are now on our way to Cairo.  It is extremely interesting to watch the various views as you go along.  All the route is guarded by Indian Troops who cheer like mad.  The Carriages are the funniest things in creation.</p>
<p>We expect to arrive in Cairo at 2.30 am in the morning. You only pass small townships on the way, all the rest is Desert except for the "oasis's" on the way.  The Native quarters are absolutely filthy &amp;</p>
