Talk about the adventures of Aristide Pujol.  [The Joyous Adventures of Aristide Pujol by William J. Locke.]He's engaged to a little French lady and writes her a feverish letter in English once a day.  This I rewrite in still more heated language and all her letters translate.  A glorious job but so exhausting that I feel I'm using up all the my latent mental love motive and literary psychic energy forces in his romantic cause and neglecting my one and only precious little Wife.
If there's ever a little person I speak of with pride that Person is you dear.  If there's ever a good boy friend who hasn't heard of My wife and seen her photograph playing the mandolin, I'd like to know who he is.
All the kisses and love in the world my Dear Precious one!  I just pray that you are well and happy.
Your Vasco, for ever and ever and ever xxxxxLove to Jack, Jen, the Children, Tom, Max, Hughie and the dear good Duffys.
Everybody turns up here in this camp.  Even Jack Sexton and Bill Chadwick a Cousin of the Winterbottoms and friend of the Duffy's.  I can promise you I have great times and lots of real French Leave.
Love to Mrs. Daly.  I never wrote to find I didn't write to any of them in France (Pas d'obligations).  I must finish with just one more hug xxxxx and an everlasting kiss of love that I hope will bring you all the luck and happiness in the world.  (Love to the dear Mandolin and once more to yourself, xxxx.
