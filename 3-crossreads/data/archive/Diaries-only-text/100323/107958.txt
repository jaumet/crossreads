6/8/19 Durban
A lovely fine summery day. Went up the town and found it very busy after yesterday's celebrations. Rode in a rickshaw drawn by a nigger who leant well back and made it propel him. Some women about wearing long pumpkin shaped masses of hair ? fine sturdy brown women like men in physique. The type of nigger seen here is a very fine type. In the afternoon with the doctor had afternoon tea at the Royal and then back to the ship once more. After dinner with Smythe to the Club going by one of their excellent trams and then down to the Beach where we heard our Concert party playing to a small audience in the YMCA hall. Pay (half) on Friday morning ? will the troops abuse this privilege.
