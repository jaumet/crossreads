 Saturday 11 August 1917 
 We have all to be in by 8 p.m. &amp; when out wear a Blue Band on our arm. 
 This morning I met Gen. Meredith &amp; went to Stanley Bay swimming Beach.  Mixed bathing &ndash; knocks me out.  
 This afternoon went to MUZAH Gardens, in a glass house I was shown the "Fern that goes to sleep" as soon as a leaf is touched it closes up &amp; droops. In five minutes time it freshens up again. Have you ever heard of such a plant. The Orchids were very good, a peaceful place to pass away an hour or so.
