Fine & very warm. Got general
leave again till 8 pm. I bought
some things in the morning &
went out to The Bertram's at
High Constantia with Major
Campbell for lunch. Lay out
under the trees yarning all
the afternoon. Came back to
the Grand Hotel for dinner.
& back to the boat at 8 pm.
Found we were not going till
morning so five of us got a
car & went for a run round
Sea Point & back.
Enjoyed the stay in Cape
Town very much.
