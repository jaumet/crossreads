So we have to go another 45 before we reach Lemnos  The last time that I was going this was was Early in april before we made our name at gallipoli  I was going over then with my mates who have been wounded or Killed one of them has gone back to australia his name is L.G. Mason. 58 on board there are about 25 life Boats  So we will have a chance if we Do happen to get torpedoed. I Dont think we will Strike any and I Dont mind telling you we Dont want to Either.
