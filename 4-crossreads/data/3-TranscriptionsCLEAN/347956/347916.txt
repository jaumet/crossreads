 as being out of action; I believe the advance guard of the 3rd Contingent arrived here this afternoon, had a sore throat from arguing the point when I went to sleep at 9 oclock 
 Wed 10th Woke this morning feeling rather well & have been on light duties;  C Sqd has gone out to the range again for musketry & I put a good part of the morning in washing up  The Sq. signallers did not go to the range; Were supposed to be paid to-day but it was postponed; the dust has been horrible today & I retired to bed early
