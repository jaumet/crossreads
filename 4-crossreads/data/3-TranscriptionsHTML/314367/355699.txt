<p>Tuesday Jan 19-15 &ndash;  Fitz &amp; I swam at 5.45 am &ndash; After sick parade I went to the Garrison Hospital &ndash; I saw Strangman &amp; then I learnt that several patients had been discharged who should <u>not</u> have been discharged &ndash; He told me this himself &ndash; I had suspected as much &ndash; Young inexperienced chaps had acted &ndash; I then left &amp; went inboard the Sumatra &ndash; the usual glass of lager &ndash; then to the Fantome &ndash; There I found 3 more dischargees from the G. Hospital &ndash; At the Hosp they told <u>me</u> <u>none had</u> been discharged &ndash; This will show the incoherence of the management to say the least &ndash;<br/>In the aftn I personally returned one of the sick &ndash; Do you think I cd get hold of a medical officer? Not one &ndash; I wrote a note to Strangman &amp; left &ndash; I took a stretcher party with my SBA &amp; I gave him the benefit of naval language (acquired by me since Aug 22) on his gross mismanagement &ndash; It is so characteristic of Johnson &ndash; He pretends to know how to run things but is beastly incompetent</p>
