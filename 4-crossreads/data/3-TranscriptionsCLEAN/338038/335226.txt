  
 Serapeum Suez Canal 14.4.16 My dear Father, 
 Many thanks for your letter of 6th March. You will be surprised to hear that this is the first of yours received since one of the Feb 4th, I expect the other letters have gone on to the 1st Division to France, and I shall probably get them some time in the next month or so. 
 The fact of those previous letters not having arrived leaves me rather in the dark about one or two matters mentioned in your last. 
 I am of course very relieved to hear you are all keeping well after the long spell without any news of you. Pats letter of 6th March has also come to hand and I am answering it 
 [The following is written across the top of the page:] P.S. Am writing Mum separately this mail. TWG. Had a letter from Arch Castledon lately. The Naval Bridging Train is being disbanded and Arch expects to ge a commission in the Engineers. He is now in Ismailia but I have not seen him yet  TWG
