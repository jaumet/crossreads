<p>9th March 1915 Tuesday</p>
<p>Reveille 5.30 a.m.  Moored to the jetty at Alexandria 9 a.m.  Two Union Castle boats are anchored here as hospital ships.  They are painted white &amp; encircled with a broad green band broken thrice on each side by a huge red cross.  The 'Chilka'  &amp; 'Mashubra'  arrived at 10 p.m.  We have been served out each with 25 biscuits &amp; a 1 lb tin of bully beef.  A train load of men went before dinner.  Everyone had gone by 2.30 p.m. except my section of the 6th.  We had been left</p>
