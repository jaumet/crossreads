He stood at the door, and just stared hard at me for about five minutes; then with out taking his eyes off me he edged up the passage and called out in Arabic to one of the police down below. Evidently they put him wise to me, as the Yanks would say,  for he cleared out quick, and afterwards came creeping into the room with an extra cup and saucer. I could see that it only required one strajetic strategic move on my part to complete the victory, so i said "Walad, take my hat and cane". The day was mine!!! he crept over with down cast eyes, took my hat and glided out of the room.
