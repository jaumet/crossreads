Sunday 31 March
Still particularly quiet on the front, but it is said that there is a raid coming off to-night. There is a German Labour Battn. holding the line opposite us. This month has been a month of wonders, the Ludendorff Offensive which now is twenty five miles deep from La Fere to Montdider, now the Germans are ten miles from Amiens can shell the Amiens-Paris railway. Prisoners are 70000 Guns 1100, according to Berlin in my opinion in spite of expressions to the contrary, the British High Command was caught napping. Then the new era in guns, the shelling of Paris from 75 miles distance, is a wonder to be wondered at.
