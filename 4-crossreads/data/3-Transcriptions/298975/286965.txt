<p>out of Fovant Camp at 4 PM nearly the same number wandered wearily into Sutton Vissy camp The walk was about 15 miles It was a beautifull day after the frost in the morning. Cool &amp; bright Cannot say I am tired With a lot of struggle &amp; strife we got blankets ticks &amp; boards simed out &amp; got a neary fair tea about 7 Hot stew &ndash; well it was a sort of stew. A few of us had extra tucker on the march today. Our Hut had a good fire all last night as Jones &amp; I went straight into the coal yard &amp; took a bag of coal It was stealing but as we did it with many looking they thought we had a right to it</p>
