<p>10 p.m. This has been a day of clouds &amp; threatening rain. With darkness the drops commenced to fall more rapidly, now they are a continuous mild downpour. The evening hate from the warship on either flank consisted in but four shells sent as complements from the sea to the land. Up on Walker's Ridge &amp; Russel's Top the crack of the rifles ceases but for moments, a machine gun now &amp; then pours forth its savage rapid hammer hammer, while occasionally a bomb resounds through the air. Wonderful men on both sides to keep the famous game going both night and day in fair and stormy weather.<br/>This morning I saw two dead Turks; they were of a party that passed between two outposts to attack the camp, they were noticed &amp; fired upon; the others of the daring men escaped to their own lines. They were both strong young men. Each was armed with rifle &amp; bayonet, provided with plenty of ammunition &amp; two varieties of bombs, the jam tin &amp; the Cricket ball.</p>
<p>Good night my dear. Good night. Good night.<br/>[A line of Xs and Os.]</p>
<p>23-10-15. &ndash; 3 p.m. Jerrom has all packed up we are timed to board the steamer for Mudros at 8.45 p.m. thence to embark for Egypt, where in due course we hope to arrive safely. There may be some work for me to do in Cairo or elsewhere it I shall tackle with gusto.</p>
