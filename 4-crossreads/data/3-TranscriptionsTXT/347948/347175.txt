Through my bosom now so lonelyLightning rays of hope would dartThou cans't with thy sunshine onlyCalm the tempest of my heart
These loved haunts then fraught with gladnessNow to me no joy impartMemory brings alas but madnessIn the tempest of the heartThese love haunts now fraught with gladnessCan to me no joy impartMem'ry brings alas but madnessIn the tempest of the heart
Verdi  22/6/16
