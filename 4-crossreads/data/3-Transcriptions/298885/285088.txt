<p>Sun Aug 20th &ndash; 16<br/>During the night shells were fast and furious and at 11.30PM I was going along our trench when a piece of shrap caught me on the head. Apart from making me sit up and take notice it was only a scratch but a lucky one.</p>
<p>Mon Aug 31st &ndash; 16<br/>Fritz dropped bombs on our wagon lines wounding 20 men and killing 8 besides 16 horses.</p>
<p>Tues Aug 22nd &ndash; 16<br/>At last after numerous tries I found Geoff and had a good old yarn</p>
<p>Wed 23rd &ndash; 16<br/>Relieved from Orderly job and rejoined my battery</p>
