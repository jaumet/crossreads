After dinner we were practising signalling in the gully;  a good deal of shrapnel was being thrown about this afternoon &amp; as it was falling rather handy to us we knocked off early.  We went for a swim just before sundown &amp; coming back passed several wounded men being carried to the beach <strike>wounded</strike>, they were wounded on Steels Post which was shelleded rather heavily just at dusk.</p>
