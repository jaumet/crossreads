Also C.D. Bell & Lionel Sheldon, Doherty & Dave.  My they are all getting Home.  But, they have done their bit so it's very good to hear of their return.  I have just returned from 71/2 days leave in the Isle of Man.  I'll describe it all in Dad's & Mum's letters as I've to write to them yet.  The weather here is abominably hot & it is awful to get about during day-time.  This may seem incredible but it is nevertheless true.  But in 2 months time, Gee! we'll have snow & ice & wind & hail, ugh!!  You don't know what cold is like.
