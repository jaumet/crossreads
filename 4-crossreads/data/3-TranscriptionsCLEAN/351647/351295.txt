 Dear Mrs. John, 
 It is such ages since I last heard from you that I have been wondering what has happened.  Hope I didn't say anything in any of my letters that offended your Royal Highness.  I had been hoping to have vivid glowing letters telling me all about Singapore and the trip generally.  But so far nary a word & great is the sorrowing in consequence. 
 I trust that  the  nothing terrible exciting has happened.  Oh well its no use worrying, only I've missed your letters very much, more especially as I haven't had a word from Tog at all for ages.  Miss Hilda wrote & told me you were due back but didn't say how you enjoyed the trip. 
 How is the Boss & Graham. 
 I'm afraid my letters lately have been neither frequent nor interesting but there has been very little to write bout bar mud & weather & they are not interesting. 
 There weren't many stunts & Fritz's little affairs were too regular to be exciting.  Only one
