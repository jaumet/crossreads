near the camping ground called Surafend. The Bedouins here are thieves and  are always after Horsefeed, rations & Clothing. There is sure to be trouble if this thing is allowed to go on.Tuesday Nov 17to day there were 800 horses shot out on the sandhills.  They were all aged Animals or worn out. It seemed a pity that they should meet with this reward after faithful service but it is better so that that for should they fall into the hands of the Bedouins or Jews they would have a rough spin. The Bedouins & Jews as a body are very cruel to Animals.
