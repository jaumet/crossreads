A very heavy fall of snow again last night, must be fully a foot deep. fairly quiet day, very little "straffing".
(19) Very cold morning. Had a batch of 20 Reinforcements join us up this morning. A party form our Coy went down to Divisional Baths this afternoon. We were badly in need of a wash as the dirt was well grimed in, We also received a change of flannels, which was very acceptable indeed (Guess we shall have a little sleep to night, getting rid of so much vermin.) They fairly sit up and bark at a bloke. Fritz Artillery opened up again this evening, there happened to be a great many men on the move, and of course there were many casualties.
(20) Still on the cold side. Fritz Guns busy again this morning, several blokes knocked, Stretcher bearers having a fairly busy time. About 3 o,clock this afternoon Fritz got real narked Shell our dug-outs a treat, The day was very clear for Observation and "Fritz" took advantage of it.
(21) Sunday. Things fairly quiet this morning. Usual Artillery activity this evening, several casualties, Stretcher bearers hard at work carrying their patients back near Bde Headquarters, fair distance off the ground being covered in snow makes matters worse.
