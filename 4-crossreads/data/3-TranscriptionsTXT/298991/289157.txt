Tuesday April 10thFeeling very bad last night &amp; this morning. Snowing this morning, but changed to a very fine afternoon. Got all my French money changed into English here, a franc is worth eight pence, or 10 francs for 7/-. Very quiet lying in bed.
Wednesday  April 11thVery dull day, snowing slightly, also very cold. Was shifted right down one end of the ward, I was just about in the middle before. There are about 60 beds altogether in the ward, laid out in four rows. We have a piano &amp; gramophone, so we are never short of music.
Thursday April 12thSnowed fairly heavy today. Very bleak &amp; cold. Feeling much better. Booked up to go to an Australian hospital &amp; wont be sorry when we do go either, as we are missing the benefits of our red cross, certainly we got a few things issued out to us here by the red cross, but not near so much as if we were in our own hospital.
Friday April 13thA sunshiney day, although rather cold. From what I can see here an Australian or even a Colonial men are treated as dirt. They get only the attention that is absolutely necessary, &amp; not even that from some of the nurses, who have heads on them like blocks of wood, &amp; are very pig-headed.
