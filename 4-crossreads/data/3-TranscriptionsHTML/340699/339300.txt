<p>Bois d'Escardonneuse<br/>21/7/18.<br/>Since yesterday - nothing doing owing to the weather, which is absolutely rotten. Last night had a 'phone call from Col. Peck who wanted to know how I was getting on. Fred Leist was evidently at his side, for he also spoke. Leist is coming out to see my stuff. In half an hour I am riding over on horseback to H.Q. to get my mail and a change of underclothing. That is the reason I'm writing now, tho' I have only just finished lunch. Isn't it magnificent the way the French and Yanks have done? Up to date our rumours have always been confirmed by the following day's official communiques (comic cuts" the digs call them) and as yesterday's was very good we're all praying that to-day's  "Comic Cuts" will confirm them. Last night, owing possibly to the rain and clouds, was a quiet one and every one had a good sleep. This morning (Sunday) I didn't get up till noon and feel 100% better for it. It may be that I will be able to see Leist to-day and get some "good oil" regarding the possibility of special leave - anyway I'll give it a fly, DONT'T BUILD ON IT! I've just finished a book on American life called "Queed" by a writer named Henry Sydnor Harrison. It struck me as being "real" good; very American, democratic and decently optimistic. I need to borrow some of the last commodity.</p>
<p>Bois d'Escardonneuse<br/>22/7/18.<br/>Yesterday I rode to H.Q. to get mail, money and fresh underclothes. Mr. Partis' batman accompanied me to try and get eatables for the mess. I rode a grey mare I'd had before; an old mule for stubborness but easy enough to manage. I succeeded in finding no one I went to see but transacted my business and got back just before supper. The Hun obligingly waited until we just got out of the last village before we reached camp - our nearest neighbour - before he shelled it. He generally does this at noon or about 7. This time he began earlier. To-day again he was back at his noon stunts. After supper, it being still cloudy and feeling very tired I took a rest, until an importunate relieving Lieut, got me</p>
