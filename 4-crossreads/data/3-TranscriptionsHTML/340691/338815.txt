<p>Absent.</p>
<p>Sometimes between long shadows on the grass<br/>The little truant waves of sunlight pass<br/>My eyes grow dim with tenderness the while<br/>Thinking I see thee smile.<br/>And sometimes in the twilight gloom apart<br/>The tall trees whisper <strike>heart</strike> whisper heart to heart<br/>Thinking I hear thee call.</p>
<p><u>Because.</u></p>
<p>Because you come to me with naught save love<br/>And hold my hand and lift mine eyes above<br/>A wider world of hope &amp; joy I see<br/>Because you come to me.<br/>Because you speak to me in accents sweet<br/>I find the roses waking round my feet<br/>And I am led through tears &amp; joy to thee<br/>Because you speak to me.<br/>Because God made thee mine I'll cherish thee<br/>Through light &amp; darkness &amp; all time to be<br/>And pray his love may make our love divine<br/>Because God made thee mine.</p>
<p>God send you back to me.</p>
<p>Love you have left me weary and lonely.<br/>Sailing so far away<br/>Ah how I miss you- daily I'm praying<br/>Safely you'll come home someday.<br/>Though we are parted- love lives for ever<br/>When hearts are fond and true.<br/>So, till our meeting, let us remember<br/>Ever I pray for you.<br/>God send you back to me.<br/>Over the mighty sea<br/>Dearest I want you near<br/>God dwells above <strike>one</strike> you<br/>Knows how I love you<br/>He will bring you back to me</p>
