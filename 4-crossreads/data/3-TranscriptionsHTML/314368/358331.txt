<p>yards away from this camp and sometimes one can see as many as 12 or 14 up in the air at once. Some of the pilots carry passengers occasionally so I must try and have a fly before leaving England. All Australians are having a royal time over here, in London they get a fine time and a couple of chaps told me that when they were up in Scotland a week ago the people wouldn't let them pay for anything. Can't we rake up some relatives over here? Most of the chaps have had someone to look up.<br/>I was very pleased to see by one of your last letters that you had had so much rain it will give all the new trees a good start. I daresay that dad and Ted have had them in long ago. Percy said that he was sitting for an exam just a short while after he wrote last. I suppose that means a shift for him if he was successful. We are having beautiful weather here just now but I believe that it is a regular corker here in the winter, but by then we ought to be away. No more new this time Ida trusting that all are quite well at home and that Aub is getting well and strong , with best love to all<br/>Your Loving Brother<br/>Gordon.</p>
