<p>10th letter</p>
<p>Same place<br/>4.8.1916</p>
<p>Darlings<br/>You seem such a long long way away that you must excuse me for the above.</p>
<p>The Bairam is over.  The 4 days feast that follows Ramadan.  The boys were all restricted from going into Cairo.  I expect they thought they might be mischievous and perhaps interefere with their religious rites.</p>
<p>To-day Sister Rush was taken from E Ward and put in charge of a Surgical Ward.  Top [indecipherable] for a Staff Nurse.  But I shall miss her.</p>
<p>We are kept on the qui vie of what might be happening at the Canal.  We hear all sorts of things, but one never knows quite how much to believe.</p>
<p>Sunday 6th Matron has gone away for 2 days to see about a place at the seaside where she could send the Sisters to for a change &ndash; no doubt so many pale faces are worrying her &ndash; yet considering the heat some keep remarkably well.  I am thankful to say I am one of them but all the same I wouldn't say no to a few days at the sea-side fancy the waves &amp; a swim again.</p>
<p>There is evidently something on with the Turks for the wounded are arriving.  It makes me wish to be in a Surgical Ward.  One doesn't like to be out of the excitement of things but theres rules &ndash; (so sorry)</p>
