<p>No. 2 General Hospital<br/>Mena<br/>Cairo.<br/>2.3.15.</p>
<p>My dearest old Mrs,<br/>It was good to get your very welcome cable from Tenerife &ndash; the first intimation I have had that you were on the way to London &ndash; that you had left Sydney &amp; that you were all well.   It was handed to me while I was hard at it on the afternoon of the 23rd &amp; needless to say I could not have had a more acceptable birthday present.   On the strength of it I shouted beer all round to the men at dinner.   I have since received the cable announcing your safe arrival at the heart of the Empire &ndash; I was greatly relieved to get this &ndash; at times I have been terribly down in the dumps;  you don't know how often I have pictured Margaret &amp; Tingsey dead.   When I tell you this you can imagine what a relief it was to me to get some news.   The last letter I got from you was from "The Wurley" dated 15th December &ndash; I got this on our arrival at Alexandria.  I have had no letters at all from any of the Coolabah folk.   On receipt of your cable from London I wired C/o Commercial Bank Sydney 18 Birchin Lane London "Cables received all well love imagination"</p>
