Hastily packed our kits, got permission from the Sgt at 9th Batt headquarters & started on our way. We found the 3rd a couple of hundred yards the other (Cassel) side of the village running a main-dressing station in some farm buildings alongside the road.It was a lovely fine Sunday afternoon when we arrived back, & most of the bearers were free, so we looked up most of our friends.
