Monday 16 Sept 1918
The latest news is that there is going to be a big stunt here in the course of a day or two after which we may expect to be relieved for our long rest. Judging by the guns & other war material we have here, our mutual friend is going to have a hot time. There are five divisions of artillery on a one division front, & the 9.2 guns are within a couple of thousand yards of the front line.
The greater number part of our guns have has not yet been tested but is lying camouflaged & unknown to the enemy. I have watched ammunition dumps growing, & the increase in size, despite the drainage of stuff to the line, is remarkable. Tanks too are in abundance somewhere near here, so there will be a few hours of excitement.
