 one chap had a miraculous escape. He fell off the front horses and was passed over by a hinder pair &amp; a wagon &amp; all he got was stamped on the head &amp; arm. His arm is swollen &amp; cut &amp; his head has had 3 stitches, but he is the liveliest in the ward and badly wants to be back at duty. This was only yesterday too. 
 The duties are the worst part of the business. There are many hours with nothing to do but yarn and play cards. But taking temperatures, pulses, and watching the charts is great. We love to get their feed and was up &amp; generally wait on them. Jim is in another ward. 
 Don't come up this weekend unless I let you know. Unfortunately we put in for leave 24 hours before we start &amp; only get it back, perhaps negatived, a few hours before. The weather has been fine &amp; I'm in grand nick. You ought to hear the absolutely blue remarks concerning a hurdy gurdy which is playing near the ward. Ross Purdreau &amp; Malc. Vicars &amp; Ernie Snashall are in the A.M.C. Well, I hope all are well. Give my love to all &amp; tell Wilga she is to give all the help she can now. 
 Remember me to all you see. 
 Yours lovingly 
 Dene.
