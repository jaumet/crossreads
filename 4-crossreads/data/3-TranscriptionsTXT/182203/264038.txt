you to keep for me, two little silk handkerchiefs for Eddy (given by wounded soldiers too). A lucky pig, &  a native dagger, with arabic writing on the blade, for Eddy from Auntie Eddle.I have a few more things to send, so shall pack them up next, shall write  & let you know what I'm sending.Had a letter from Fred yesterday saying he had received a cable telling of poor Ray Grist's death. He is coming in to-morrow to take us out to afternoon tea. When we move to another part of the world, I shall cable. Hope you are all friendly with Lucy again.Fondest love & heaps of kisses.
