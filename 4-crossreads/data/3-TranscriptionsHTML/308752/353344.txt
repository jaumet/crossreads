<p>Wednesday 21st June 1916.<br/>Perfect weather sea like a sheet of glass. Malta passed today. Food good, but very little of it.</p>
<p>Thursday 22nd June.<br/>Sardinia sighted today. Parade held at 3:30 p.m. in our Australian uniforms, our drill khaki put in kit bags &amp; placed in the hold of the ship. I believe there will be sent back to Egypt or most probably <u>dumped overboard</u>. Air very fresh today, everyone feeling the cold immensely after living in the heat of Egypt.</p>
<p>Friday 23rd June.<br/>7 a.m. Entering port of Marseilles, civilisation at last. Quite a treat to see no dirty niggers about. Band playing on top deck, great excitement on board, the cheers<br/>were deafening. (just read in newspaper that enemy Aeroplanes flew over Serapeum &amp; attempted to drop bombs on the camp &amp; boats proceeding up the Canal. We spent 3 months there). 4 p.m. Disembarked &amp; proceeded to railway station to start off on our journey from the South to the4 North of France. Crowds of womenfolk thronged the streets &amp; gave the troops a great reception. Started off at 6 p.m. It is without a doubt the most beautiful country that I ever set foot on. You cannot imagine the splendour of the scenery, especially after the sandy desert. The cultivation of the land is really wonderful even enormous hills are under cultivation. Everything looks beautifully fresh &amp; green, this evidently the best time of the year to travel in this country, the land is looking at its best. At every big station we passed the inhabitants gave us a good cheer &amp; of course we returned the compliment. French soldiers are to be seen everywhere. One thing I could not help noticing that the majority of men working on the farms etc. etc. were elderly men, too old for soldiers &amp; nearly every woman seen, was dressed in mourning. There is a solemn quietness about the country we passed through, everyone</p>
