  
 Saturday 13 October 1917 Life as usual.  We are sailing due west or practically so.  All lights shut off and no music on acct. of Sister Watson this latter. Knitting balaclava cap - grey.  Fit of the "blues" and feeling very down.  Must fight it of course.  Reading nursing book & gaining fair am't knowledge therein.  Sister Gill Warwick helping me by printing my photos but heat - or not sufficient washing - causing them to peel off. How is it diary that I can always go through life without chasing men?  Very lonely I admit & must miss a lot of fun but still it never seems necessary.
