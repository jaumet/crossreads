<p>1917 Thursday 16 August</p>
<p>Patient named Cormack, Scottie, in piece of shrap embedded in heart. A good chap, "You're a good fellow Jock"?  Take to him straight away, an interesting case, of course can't operate upon him, piece removed from his side however. <br/>Got rid of Forster this morn.</p>
