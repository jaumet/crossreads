<p>my letter from Reading dated Feb. 27 had not quite reached you when you wrote on April 3.</p>
<p>I am at present engaged on another branch of the R.F.C. work which, though sometimes inclined to be looked down on by the aeroplanists and the "unknowing", is quite interesting and also useful.  It is certainly not as pleasant nor has it the scope for acts of astonishing bravery &amp; cool headedness as aeroplane work.  This work is artillery observation from an anchored or "Kite" balloon.  These balloons operate from about 4 miles behind the front lines and at a height ranging from 2 to 4 thousand feet.  They are out of the reach of rifle &amp; machine gun bullets and are also a fairly difficult mark for the gunners when they take it into their heads to shell them.  I am about half way through a course at Roehampton, and hope to get out to France next month &ndash; probably a good deal sooner than if I were still on aeroplane work.</p>
<p>After some experience at the front (of which I feel the need more keenly every day) I may get a chance of resuming my aeroplane tuition, and probably under far more congenial circumstances than have hitherto existed.</p>
<p>We have done a certain amount of <u>free</u> ballooning and I have been right across London three times.  It was a decidedly interesting experience.  The management and navigation of a balloon is, as you will guess, a good deal simpler than that of an aeroplane.  But one cannot go to sleep over it.</p>
<p>If everything continues as at present appears likely I shall probably write you one more note from here, after which I hope to be able to send you my impressions of the real thing which I have been reading about now for nearly two years.</p>
<p>With very kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson, Dorothy &amp; yourself,<br/>Yours<br/>L.O'G. Whitfeld</p>
