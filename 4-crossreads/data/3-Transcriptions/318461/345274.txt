<p>Thursday. 17/5/17<br/>Been much quieter altho a good few shells came over yesterday afternoon &amp; last night some of them gas. Take it all round there was not anything out of the ordinary except that they came from one quarter only viz on the left. so that it is probable that he is retiring one sector at a time. There are expectations that we are to be relieved tonight but nothing definite, the sooner the better.<br/>Pay 17/1 &pound;25.12.0</p>
