  
 Thursday 26 July 1917. 
 6 o'clock reveille again this morning. A little fatigue work preparing to move out of camp. Light Horse moved out to Details Camp at Moascar. 
 Wrote to D'nong (Sigd. green O.A.S. envelope with snap of Doris (Imperial) enclosed and posted same at Post Office in Moascar Camp.) 
 Found later that such snaps are not permissable, that was the reason why I added the bracketed note above to protect myself should anything arise about it later.
