could not stay there all night, found us billets in a convent.
10th  In the morning we left at 8 a.m. for Ypres which is in Belgium about 10 kilos from Poperinghe.The aeroplanes are far bigger and faster than any I have previously seen, the main feature being the new British Triplane.                   Ypres is simply a mass of devasted Brick-work, ruins, ruins as far as the eye can see.
