<p>After Macron the route continued along the banks of the Saone as far as Chagny, the line in many places being right alongside the river, a rather sluggish, turgid stream. On the banks growing almost in water were planes, poplars, cypresses and fires.<br/> Here is a typical country lane with bramble hedges on either side from which a blackbird flies out as the train passes. Fronting this road is an ivy covered cottage surrounded by a tiny picket fence within which several gesticulating youngsters clamour for "souvenir" or "bullee biff". Many are the coat and cap badges, hard biscuits and tins of bully beef thrown to the country people along the route with the usual prodigality of the Australian soldier. Sometimes coppers were thrown but whatever it was it caused a scramble from which some youngsters emerged smiling and victorious.<br/>Over yonder is an aged couple with pitchforks spreading farmyard manure that has been dumped in heaps over a stubble field whilst a pet lamb with ample fleece and long tail is playing by. In the next field is a crop of mustard of which the yellow flower makes a striking feature in the landscape and on the other side are a number of sleek cows browsing over a pasture. A flock of goats are meantime nibbling at the roadside hedges just bursting into bud. Further on is an orchard of 3to 4 acres extent in which peaches and plums are in blossom, and near by are a couple of acres of a cereal crop 8 to 12 inches high just commencing to make its spring shoot. In other lower lying places with indifferent drainage the cereals are grown in ridged fields.<br/>But grapes are the predominating crop. They are planted in perfect alignment with the soil between rows most carefully tilled, and are neatly staked. Trellising is rarer.<br/>Now we cross the bridge over a canal opening into the Saone and used as a waterway for barges. The narrow tow path is well worn, and there is moored to a stake in the bank a black painted flat bottomed boat. Then we skirt along the fringe of a wood in which we can pick out the mottled stems of poplars, the comparatively straight elms and more spreading beeches. Climbing up the trunks of many of them is a tangled mass of ivy, more picturesque than useful. From the undergrowth there flies up a white breasted bird with black throat and wings and a long spreading tail; it is about the size of a peewee but has a most awkward manner of flight. A more common sight is that of 5 or 6 rooks flying nosily aver a newly ploughed field which is being harrowed by tow women whose umbrellas and belongings tied up in a large handkerchief are to be seen in one corner.<br/>Then again we bypass a two storied house alongside the railway line from which a woman with a</p>
