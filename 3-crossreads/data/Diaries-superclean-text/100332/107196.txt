Sunday 10th. I had another enjoyable ride on the Eng in lovely weather to Bethune arriving there on time, where I left my chums, as they wished to have a look at the Locomotive sheds I intended to have a look at the Cemetery past the Canal I made my way up into the Square inquired the way soon arrived at the Canal, where several Steam Tugs were lying alongside the Wharf. It is very pretty along this Canal the grass being nice green on the sloping back in between the Wharfs. Having crossed the Canal, I came to the entrance to the Cemetery which is surrounded by a high brick wall there are two large Iron Gates which were opened in I walked along the road. There are Pine Trees on each side growing which add to the beauty the Marble Tombs, Head Stones Glass Houses glittered in the Sun
