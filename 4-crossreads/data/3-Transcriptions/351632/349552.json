<p>not how the fight was going.  We could only hear the shouts for ammunition and the continued rapid fire of our guns.  At one time we heeled over, and the operating table, with "O" upon it, took charge.  It seemed as though we had been hit, but it was only a sudden alteration of course, as we soon found out.</p>
<p>Our constant attention was now taken up by two cases &ndash; "D" and "B".  Normal saline was administered, in the first case subcutaneously, in the latter intra-venously;  wounds were re-dressed, and all the methods of reducing shock tried.  "D" was hopeless from the first, and died two hours after being wounded, after going through much pain.  "B" somewhat improved after the saline, but air-hunger was pronounced and he complained of constriction round the chest, and tried to remove the bandages.  There was oozing of blood from the wound and pulse was very weak.  The other cases were not so urgent, but many were in considerable pain, and all that could be done was temporary until operative interference could be carried out.  The ward room was hurriedly rigged up as a hospital, and lotions, dressings &amp; instruments were placed about.  The first aid party did excellent work now in looking after the wants of the wounded.</p>
<p>The actual extent of the injuries could not definitely be made out until the cases were on the table.  As soon as the sick berth could be spared, I gave orders for the sick bay to be rigged up as an operating theatre</p>
