<p>Friday 14 April 1916<br/>First time I have used this book, but am compelled to let the big diary go for the rime, hoping as occasions offer to try &amp; write up impressions of France gained on our overland trip.<br/>Still in the isolation camp on the railway side between Etaples &amp; Camieres. With the exception of one or two light but driving showers, a fine sunny day but quite unpleasant in the cold biting wind blowing in from the sea all day.<br/>Again on battalion duties, detailed to beautify the camp. Erecting a rustic fence round officers' quarters, making ground decorations with sea sand &amp; shells round battalion orderly tent &amp; Q.M.Stores &amp;c. Numerous train-loads of artillery with their field guns passed during the day bound N.</p>
