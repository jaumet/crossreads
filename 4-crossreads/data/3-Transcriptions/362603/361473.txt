<p>2.  lives next door &amp; when I'm out, Ellis generally goes in &amp; plays Casino.  I got a letter from Cyril a couple of days ago &amp; He states that he is being sent to Weymouth Convalescent.  His arm is not quite better yet, but it must be nearly well.<br/>I heard from Bessie later than You, &amp; She states that her Dad is not too bad at that time.  He is having a rotten time poor old Chap.  Bess was sure to go to a Fortune Teller.  She often told me about her faith in that woman at Marrickville.

Promotion is hard to get &amp; it is seldom that the deserving ones get it.<br/>Yours of the Tenth Mum states that You have at last met Julia Your Cousin at Strathfield.  How did it come about?  Do you ever meet our other relative from old Pittwater Rd.  I know the name of Frank Bardsley quite well   <strike>&amp;</strike>   but although I am positive I have met Him, I cannot place Him at all.  I will be delighted to receive and answer any letters from my new found Cousins.  I would like to know where I have met Frank Bardsley.</p>
