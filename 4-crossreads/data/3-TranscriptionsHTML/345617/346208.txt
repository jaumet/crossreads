<p>Octobre 13<br/>Still working on shelters at West Hoek. We are having wet cold weather &amp; every thing is getting in a bad state owing to the mud. The attack yesterday is now reported to have been a failure owing chiefly to the heavy rain. Where our troops went out &amp; gained their objectives they had to retire again as they could not operate in the mud &amp; water.</p>
<p>Octobre 14<br/>Working on shelters for Infty at "Hooge Ridge". Finer weather today. A good deal of artillery activity on both side the Line. Enemy aeroplanes over tonight dropping bombs.</p>
