<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; MONDAY 11&nbsp;&nbsp; DEC.</p>
<p>Cold &amp; it snowed most of the afternoon. I went over to Fargo &amp; had my throat examined &amp; reported on by the doctor over there, &amp; he said pretty well the same as D<sup>r</sup> Wylie did, but I could go through without an operation. Remaking stables in the afternoon. Got a wire from Mother in the evening to say she was coming to Salisbury in the evening.</p>
