<p>1919<br/>May 18<br/>another Aussie hat.  I had clung to my original one but it had two holes in it.  I did not want to be issued with a 14 day wonder (a variety of issue hat that went pink after that time) but hearing that good felt hats were being issued , took the chance &amp; got one.  We were also issued with our leave passes &amp; railway tickets.</p>
<p>May 19<br/>On 19 May got up at 4.25 am &amp; caught the leave train at 7 am for London.  We arrived at 12 noon.  I went straight to the Aldwych Theatre YMCA to see Mrs McKenzie.  She did not know me for the moment.  She told me about Norman Cull dying of illness.  I told her I had not got much cash.  I had &pound; 4-10-0 of my own, &amp; Don McKinnon had lent me &pound; 5, so she advised me that New Peel House was cheap.  It was near Russell Square.  I went to a concert at night at the Aldwych Theatre YM, &amp; sat in a box (for the first &amp; only time in my life).  New Peel House was cheap &ndash; beds were 6d &ndash; so I took the usual precaution &ndash; put the bed legs in my boots, put my tunic &amp;</p>
