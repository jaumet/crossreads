7/5/17  Norreuil
About 4 pm turned in and slept until 7 Hunt was out all the afternoon ratting dead Germans but found them all fairly well cleaned up. Some of the relieving troops commenced to arrive and take over from us. About 7 the Hun put up a barrage of heavy stuff on us and blotted out the place with dust smoke. Most took refuge in the brigade dugout. Our counter batteries silenced him ? or he had fired his allotted number of rounds! Later he shelled down the valley close to the village and did some splendid shooting. Flame, dust and smoke rose in curtains. Several dumps went up burning fiercely. This valley is now the nearest approach to the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Always being strafed, there are scores of dead lightly buried and stink is in the air like a poison. The artillery have a rough time. Just behind here are some batteries of 18 pounders firing directly over us. They are always kept busy but work in reliefs so get some sleep. About 8 pm inspected the sunken road and found it clean on the whole. The 1st 2nd Bdes are
