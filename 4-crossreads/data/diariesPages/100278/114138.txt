were up to their neck in it. D Coy rushed out led by Capt Price and there was a fearful fight in the street, the French people seemed astonished, and dumbfounded at the antics of the mad Australians, however it ended up by C defeating D and chasing them back to their billets where they surrended after being pounded by snowballs till they were white all over, it was great fun, we then made it up to go and bomb B and A Coys out of their billets so C started off accompanied by D and if we did not give them a doing well it was a caution they tried to shut their doors and windows but we broke them open, and fairly smothered them with snow, officers and all got a terrible doing, one or two of them got nasty one fellow threw an axe at us and rifles and bayonets and such things
