Summer SongDown by the river,Ere morning had grown into noon,A thrush with his singing began,And as sudden was silent.  AgainHis note came trilling, and soonWith a song that rippled and ranTo a constant happy refrainThe trees were aquiver.While the dew-light around us still glistenedA thrush with his singing began.And we stood, and listened and listened.For hearing this joyous new-comer,We knew you were too, O Summer,Down by the river.
O, our hearts rang for you,All through the morning of haze,The tremulous song of the thrush,Till you rose in a glory of light.Then, season of radiant days,There came a wonder and hushThat spread over hollow and height.And no song rang for you.Ah, though our lips may not followThe tremulous song of the thrush,Yet, when over the hillside and hollowYou break through the morning of haze,That parts from your splendor asunder,We too, may be mute in our wonder,With him that sang for you.Harley MatthewsFairfieldN.S.W.
