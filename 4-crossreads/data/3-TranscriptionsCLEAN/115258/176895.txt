Cairo Comforts people and asked them to pay it in at AIF Hqtrs - which they did and I have now got a credit for it in my pay-book. The cake in your parcel was quite fresh and very nice Mother; and the shaving soap just what I wanted as I have been without any for over six weeks and have had to use Cpl Edwards's all that time. Had very much un-luck this last stunt, had not shaving soap, threw away my hair-brush to lighten my load, lent my comb and it was lost, had my towel pinched by niggers and then when we camped on the Jordan we ran out of soap, and if we had been in the desert we should have had tons of it. However I'm pretty well set up again now we got an issue of soap, a towel came in a comforts fund parcel, I got a brush a couple of days ago at the canteen and now the shaving soap comes. One thing is we have always had a good mirror with us - the helio - so have been able to see ourselves as ithers see us. These mountains round here are terribly rough and barren - not a bit fertile like those East of Jordan - they are just like the waves of the sea - when you get to the top of a hill all you can see is more mountains ahead again.
