<p>I have not Mrs. Captain Frasers or her daughters address.</p>
<p>Since dinner I have written several Xmas letters which I may have opportunity to post in Fremantle.  Taking time by the forelock you will say.  Is it not good to do so?  Most of my day has been occupied in an effort to grasp French pronunciation.  Some portion has been given to surgery.</p>
<p>Dr. Springthorp has followed my example &amp; upon the wall of our cabin hang photos of various members of his family.  Two boys &amp; a girl comprise his crowd, two grown up and the third at the Melbourne University.  His daughter, the eldest, has gone to England there to be married.</p>

<p>If Nan be with you tell her that Dr. Kennedy is playing deck billiards with a party of officers and nurses.  He desires me send his best wishes to all of you for the holiday season.</p>
<p>Many thanks Kitty, my dear, for putting so neat a cover on M.M. Joseph's gift to me.</p>
