Went to my billet where I found Matthews Kennedy & Chalmers with Raoul, Marthe, Yvonne, Malle, 2 Madames and a few old people. Wine was produced and at first I thought everyone was going to be unnaturally quiet. However persuaded them to sing Le Brabencon and Marseillaise after which we had a very gay evening drinking wine and cognac and having a large supper of such cakes as we never saw in France. "Le gourmandise, c'est pas beau - mais c'est bon"!. Did a line with Yvonne much to the chagrin of Percy. It had struck 12 on the clock when we took leave remarking that New Year's Day 1919 was finished and had given place to the 2nd day of January.
