Auntie did say something when she was out at the parsonage about my going up to Woodford for a week a little later on, but kind &amp; nice as she is I really couldn't stand it there.  I feel as if I never know what she expects of one and it would all get on my nerves, specially as she would be sure to have some of the Taylor girls living there whom I don't love.  I know one of them is staying there now.   However I am going to write &amp; tell her how sorry I am about missing her and thank her for her kindness: though there was nothing in any way definite about a Woodford visit I wouldn't like to hurt her feelings at all; I don't think it will though for we told her I thought of going to Katoomba. I have been writing to Rid &amp; I find my time has gone &amp; it is mail time.  Olive said to-day that I was getting quite a colour, I hope it lasts for you to see! Much love to you both &amp; all, Your loving daughter Ollie.
