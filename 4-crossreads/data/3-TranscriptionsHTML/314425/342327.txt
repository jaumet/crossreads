<p>waters edge.<br/>There was an early church parade this morning in the Hall. It was conducted by the same military Chaplain as on the previous Sunday.<br/>The attendance was very poor.<br/>I went for a short walk this afternoon before tea. The weather was very threatening and it had been raining lightly most of the afternoon.</p>

<p>I wrote to Tom Douglas this morning in reply to a letter I received in France.<br/>The Doctor was around this morning &amp; and asked if there were any patients who wished to be discharged.

It was given by some Naval Officers &amp; their friends.</p>
