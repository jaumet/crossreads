<p>Find me a really good port. I am very occupied &ndash; my junior colleague is a delightful chap (who knows his job and literature as well) and <strike>I</strike> we began one weeks work with 34 operations to do. My leave is up for the AMP on Feby 4th but the Authorities are good enough to strongly wish me not to return to Australia at present, moreover Judys fragility  and the evil days soon to come when Robert will be again in danger make it v difficult for me to go back to Sydney &ndash; to face that eventful voyage and the ghostliness of Clapton &ndash; Here I am at least in the heart of things &ndash; and if the further catastrophes thence fall on us, at least I am near my unfortunate wife. For myself I am taking the stern physic of hard work. And it alleviates the pains of the mind. I wish Inez was well enough to tackle the same prescription - <strike>Probably</strike> I feel pretty sure I wont be back on 4th Feby</p>
