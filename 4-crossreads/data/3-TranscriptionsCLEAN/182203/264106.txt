  
 for walks & yesterday we  go  hired a funny old cab, (somewhat like the Egyptian "Garry") with an awful mongrel of a horse - travelled at the rate of three miles an hour, the best we could procure. We thoroughly enjoy our little drive - had a little French girl with us & she made us talk  French  all the time - well, we had some fun out of it. Must try to understand what these people say. We are to learn a few words    & phrases each day so try to improve our french a little. Last Sunday-morn I went to H.C. early and quite a number were there. Had to get up much earlier but it was a very beautiful morning. Glad it was not this morning, very cold & rainy to-day. In the afternoon, went to a Military Show, was not too bad - the Tent Pegging etc was not much. Sorry none of our Aust. horse men were in it. One or two weeds of Australians
