 2 V. C. ( by a modest Privat ) drown those who fell in their sleep We fought we charg we battl Till the eighth line of trench we took For everi man there was a hero From me to the poor old cook there was the knoll just befor us Some two hundr pace or more With barb wire entangl glisten the parapet slipperi with gore the Howitz roar like perdit vomit fire death Till we saw it was mad to charg them so halt a moment for breath . Then up came our gallant major His face lit with hope cheer bliss Pass the word for pte juggin He ll find us a way out of this . If there 's on thing I hate it is skite when I hear it I alway feel sore So you wo n't think Im boast when I tell you He ought to have sent for me befor A great cheer aros as I face him said Sir I ll see you through . I ve a scheme in my head that will beat them we ll wallop them black blue . Then I shook hand with all the battalion ( There was onli 13 of us left ) they cheer me again till the foemen must have thought us of sens bereft So I gather my arm my ration gird myself for the fray . If I live to be nineti or over I ll alway rememb that day .
