<p>Sat. May 11th<br/>Glory: Alleluia. Got a Big Mail this morning. 22 Letters, from Lill, Mother, France, Kath, Nell, and Aunt Nell. My head is still buzzing from reading them.</p>
<p>There were 6 Letters from Lill, but one of 'em made me feel like a worm. I know I deserve it, so I can't growl. Got a note from Bank to say money was there, so now if I am lucky enough to pass the Board at Weymouth, it will come in handy.</p>
<p>Sun. May 12<br/>Comm. squaring up my mail. Wrote to Lill, France, Kath and sent specimen signatures to the Bank. It has been a glorious day.</p>
<p>We are not "annoyed" by many visitors at this place.</p>
<p>I hear today that all C1 are going down to Weymouth. I wish they would make out my Board Papers and send me down there. I'd soon know the worst then.</p>
<p>Mon. May 13<br/>Wrote Letter 21 to M.S. and inserted a few Home Truths.</p>
