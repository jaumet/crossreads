<p>I fear that in the correspondence line I have been somewhat remiss of late but you will pardon me I hope when I tell you that we have been in the line without a spell since beginning of January, in a part of the line where the duration of a unit's stay is generally not more than 2-3 weeks, &amp; we're very fed up too.  At any time it needs considerable stimulus to rouse my lethargic muse, at such times as these much more than normal is required.</p>
<p>I always seem to write you short &amp; stodgy epistles, some day when I feel in the mood I'll open out &amp; give you a lengthy one on the life in general &amp;c. but I never quite what you folk really want to hear about this life after the first excitement &amp; newness wears off, becomes just as much a matter of routine &amp; just as humdrum &amp; monotonous as any other walk of life, though of course if one is looking for excitement one can always find it up in front somewhere.</p>
