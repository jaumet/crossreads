<p>for'ard and I did not linger-longer.  We had 2 Hours at pitch &amp; toss, two-up it is called in the army, &amp; then slid into the Solent.  We anchored off Netley Hospital &amp; gave the Patients their Tea &amp; got the remainder to bed immediately afterwards.  May were sick including several of my Staff but I had busied myself so much over others that I had forgotten to be sick.</p>
<p>I enjoyed a lovely Dinner at 7 pm after posting my fellows to their duties.  I went on the Medical Wards myself from 9 to 11 pm &amp; the others Cpls &amp; men took 2 Hours on all through the night.  I went down to the Sisters Quarters to sleep.  I had a nice bunk on a soft velvet cushion, alone of course.  The Sisters had been sent off for safety, some months previously, when the mines were about.</p>
<p>Next morning we pulled into the Docks at Southampton &amp; at 10.30 disembarked on to a Hospital Train.  We have bread &amp; a basin of soup at 12.30 &amp; at 1 pm left for Tidworth.  History repeated itself for we did exactly the same in September 1916 with this exception that we motored to Park House Camp instead of padding the Hoof.</p>
<p>It was just lovely to get back to "dear old Blighty" after the nasty smells of France &amp; the jabbering on an unintelligible language to most of us.  We arrived at 3 pm &amp; at 10 past 3 I was on Duty again.  At 8 pm I was glad to get to bed.  Ellis arrived about 4.30 pm on the same Day after an awful experience altogether.</p>
<p>That evening Ellis &amp; I scrambled about the Car &amp; went over to see Dick Toppin our Chum at Bulford.  We had a lovely long yarn interesting on both sides although only separated about 2&frac12; months.  Next evening we went over to get some togs to take back with us, but a dance was being held at the Y.W.C.A. &amp; as we had many Friends there we decided to go, especially as we were informed that we should be returning to Bulford in a couple of days.  We had a beautiful walk over the Hills &amp; downs to camp, the silvery moonlight</p>
