<p>Arrived at Myra's  (Mrs Milne) at 7 p.m. she had invited several Military men but they did not put in an appearance. Not allowed to travel that day. I had difficulty in getting there. The trains ran at Sunday-time, the Buses stopped at 5. p.m.   &amp;  no taxis about, so had to go by Tubes from Paddington, which meant a number of changes   &amp;  a longer way around.</p>
<p>I'm getting quite clever travelling by Tubes. I used to hate them, because I could not see where I was. The Bus really is the best. Had another Xmas dinner. Turkey, ham, plum pudding etc. Myra is an excellent cook   &amp;  the dinner was lovely. A Mrs Edwards (married Sister) is staying with Myra, so we three women had it all to ourselves. We were very happy but I had to leave soon after 9. p.m.   &amp;  then got back here at 10.30.p.m. very tired out. Myra gave me some</p>
