July 26thGov sent message thru telegram to Turkish commander stating that 700 British Troops here, actually 75 or so.  Turk tells him to wait & see him drive the infidels away.
Col Bridges decides on going back as the Armenians are now 4 days overdue, I go along & offer to take a patrol to the Lake 3 days off & try to get in touch with the people.  Bridges says its impossible.  I point out it can be done by travelling at night & following the river if needs be live on dry rice.  Wont hear of it.  I'm afraid he has got the wind up over the Turk telegram.
