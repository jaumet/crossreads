 Dear Sir 
 While thanking you most sincerely for your kindness in forwarding this correspondence & giving me a chance to decide for myself, I think that for me to accept the course which is offered would hardly be playing the game. It seems to me that my duty lies in the firing line, & I am sure that Mother & Father are of the same opinion. 
 You asked me to remind you to obtain a photo of my brother's grave. His full name was Arthur Gardere Ferguson, & he was a captain in the 20th Battalion. 
 Thank you again for your kindness. 
 Yours respectfully 
 K. Ferguson
