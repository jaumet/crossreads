WADI-GUZZI
Cairo was rather upset on a recent morning - it woke up to find some (Australian of course) soldiers had climbed up the Statue of MOHAMET ALI & put a nosebag on the horse!  This is erected in principal Square of the city.
My horses are doing well on good grazing. [The following sentence crossed through.] S'pose after the war they will fall into the hands of the Remount Depot & get their tails & manes chopped off - this is the first thing a Tommy does with a horse.
We are camped in a big water worn rugged Donga or WADI about 1/4 wide down which the water has run for many centuries down to the sea.
