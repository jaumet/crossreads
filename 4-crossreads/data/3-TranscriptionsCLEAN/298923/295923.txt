  
 14 September 1918 Saturday (X to X crossed out) Ain Duk  X We ran into one & knocked him down, they are like sheep- but I had to take all particulars it may mean another Board  X- Found everything normal in Camp-  We drop illustrated propaganda by Patrols etc but as Jacko cannot often read- mostly pictures such as a Turkish cow being milked by a German etc:-  Germans tell them we give medicine to prisoners to blind them  & castrate them  All the same our prisoners are fat & contented. A Bombing Plane flew over this morning.
