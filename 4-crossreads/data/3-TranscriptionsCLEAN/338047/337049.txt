I cant remember whether someone was hanged or drawn & quartered here or whether I'm only getting it mixed up with "Curfew shall not ring tonight" but I know I was impressed at the time. We then saw the old Tudor Mansion near St Georges Chapel, & then St Georges Chapel.  There is a statue near the door to the memory of one of the Royal family, with an arrangement of yellow glass windows near it, so that while daylight lasts it appears to be in perpetual sunshine.  The Albert Memorial Chapel is attached to this.  We were only allowed as far as the door of this chapel on which a mint of money must have been spent.  Bidding farewell to the Castle, we made our way down Peascod Street, where we were given our dinner, NTB.  After [Photograph of Windsor Castle]
