<p>May 1.<br/>15th.  All day the Arabian &amp; African Coasts have been visible seeing one Arabian town &amp; at 5 p.m. we passed Perim &amp; into the Gulf of Aden.  Saw first flying fish to-day.<br/>17th.  Passed Socrota to-day very closely &amp; it is very barren indeed.<br/>20th.  Detailed to work with a Sister to-day &amp; had a very amusing time, especially in carrying a patient along the deck.  Frightfully hot &amp; enervating.</p>
