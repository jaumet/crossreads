Had a trip to Hassan Pasha Samalut this morning, the bike is still going beautifully although I can't get time to give it a complete overhaul. Mels machine is anything but good, the maggy is up the pole, the armature is brushing on the fields is consequently mis-firing, we pulled it all to pieces but could not rectify same, no tools, his clutch is also gone the buffers are worn down flush will have to be replaced.
Our instructor turned up in time we are getting along fine, went to bed at 10.30 tired hot as weather is again hot.
