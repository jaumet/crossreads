<p>The shadows are growing very long.  Before they merge in nightfall I have a mind to record some memories which I would not have pass into the realm where all things are forgotten.  Indeed I have enjoyed so much happiness, been dealt with so far beyond what I feel to have been my deserts, that it would savour of ingratitude were I to render no acknowledgment thereof.</p>
