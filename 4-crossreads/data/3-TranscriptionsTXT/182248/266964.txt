My dear Dad and Mum and Jean and Ame and everybodys.
This is to convey to you the pleasing intelligence that I have been promoted to First Lieutenant. It was announced in Divisional Orders yesterday. It is not for &quot;gallantry in the field&quot; or any such excellence, nor for anything I&#39;ve done. So I suppose its the same as the kid at school - for general proficiency. W
We&#39;ve been here for 17 days now and Brother Turk is getting very sick and sore, so we don&#39;t think the Turkish phase of the War will last long now. We hear the Germans are leaving Constantinople and the coal supply is petering out. When our dash forward comes, I think the Turkish resistance will be over after one good smack.
Our Warships had a day out on Friday and made a big demonstration and bombardment against the Turkish position. The din was terrible, guess it must have given the Turks something to think about. Things are a bit more quiet lately, - though there are occasional burst of activity from the Turkish or German Artillery. They dropped shrapnel on the beach yesterday and killed and wounded several of our chaps in swimming. I was not in, thank Goodness.
Weather here perfect. My own health and spirits ditto. Hope to finish Turkey soon, then bolt back to Egypt for our horses and come on again to give the Kaiser his quietus.
Lots of love to all.
Yours
OL.
