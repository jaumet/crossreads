 FEBRUARY 1917 
 2 FRIDAY 
 Fine &amp; sunny &amp; fairly warm in the 
 sun. Went for a bath in the 
 morning &amp; cleaning harness 
 ect all afternoon. There was 
 an inspection of everything 
 by the &quot;heads&quot; in evening, but 
 did not hear the result. There 
 was a few airial bombardments 
 right over our heads &amp; several 
 lumps of shell fell amongst 
 us.
