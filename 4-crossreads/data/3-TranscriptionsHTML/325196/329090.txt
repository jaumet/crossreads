<p>17-1-16<br/>Mon 17th<br/>This morning the Regt went out leading horses for exercise while B &amp; C. Sqd Sigs went onto the first lines of ridges signalling with helios; I believe the Tommies have patrols along these ridges every night on the look out for the enemy; We have a fine view of green fields &amp; canals on the northern side of the Railway line but on this side (the southern) there is nothing but desert; This afternoon we had no parade but stayed in our tents as it was showery;Les &amp; Reid went to the Canteen as soon as stables were dismissed &amp; bought 10/- worth of tucker; I was put on Cpl of the feed party at 8 oclock.</p>
