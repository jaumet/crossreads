Novembre 16Had quiet morning in the afternoon went up to town & Mr & Mrs Smith & Danny went to see "Bubbly" at the Comedy Theatre. Had a real good old laugh & the show was very good.
Novembre 17Had intended going to see Theodore & Co but had a wire from Jack saying that he was coming to see me so waited for him. He got here about 6 p.m. & after tea he & I went up to town & had a knock round. Went to the Savoy Hotel - another one I cannot think of the name just now & Murray's Night Club where Jack is a member. Got back about 12.30 am.
