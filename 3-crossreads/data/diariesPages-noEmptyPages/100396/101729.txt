The Brigade has just returned from a 5 days Bivouac.
We of the reinforcements did not go. I managed to have a fairly easy time but unfortunately got snapped for guard one night.
One of our chaps refused to do it. used a lot of obscene language to an officer will very probably get sent back to Aust, with other who have become medically unfit ? Cairo is a hot bed of certain diseases has been for years, one can't be two careful here, we are told.
