<p>I must warn you not to be too sanguine &ndash; war is a funny business &amp; changes are made quickly &amp; without notice.   It is of course quite on the cards that at any time a change may be made in our plans &ndash; we may be shifted to some other place.  In the event of his happening your plans in regard to coming over here may be knocked on the head so you must be prepared for this possibility.   I will of course advise you at the earliest possible moment of any projected change &ndash; you should leave instructions at Westbourne Grove Post Office to forward on any cables.  Now that we have made arrangements for getting you over &ndash; is should be very sorry if we should be moved out of Egypt unless we happened to be shifted to France where we would be so close to where you are.  I am not keen on honour &amp; glory &ndash; what I want is to be near &amp; see all my dear ones.   The Easter egg arrived yesterday &amp; seems very choice &ndash; thank you very much for sending it along.   I received your letter of 1st inst with needles &amp; thread enclosed &amp; also letter from the old man.  I have just written a letter to him.   Re vice in Cairo &ndash; nuff said.   Au revoir dearest old woman, hoping to see you &amp; the family in about 3 weeks time,<br/>Yr loving husband<br/>Will</p>
