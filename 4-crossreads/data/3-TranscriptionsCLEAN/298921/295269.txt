October, 1915Monday 25This morning I viewed brother "Turk" again, beautifully clear & the bay calm with gunboats & Hospital boats as before - Tucker "Bonelli" beef & biscuits but it is good to be on the job again.Taubes flying over & also our aeroplanes not much shelling & all hands busy preparing for the Winter by digging in - Sleep rather coldly but will soon get accustomed to that.Many improvements have taken place in saps roads & trenches since I left & the smell of dead Turks is not so bad.
