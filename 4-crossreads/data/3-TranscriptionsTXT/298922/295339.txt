 Hear a mail is in. Still getting a few Turksby our Patrols. Had the Turksused Barb wire at Maghdabad Rafa we would not have done so well. [The following sentence crossed through.] We are not amused BOSH on my neck &ndash; fancy as soon as a man gets on the Desert these things start. 
 I have been given a good book found at Maghaba &ndash; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Mantle by John Buchanan [Buchan]. You should try &amp; get it. 
 Tried to sleep on a Turkish Officers Stretcher last night but found I did better on the sand. Some of the Turkshave Medals that were given them for their Desert March to Romani!!! in Aug. these things will  sell  for 20/-.
