the Gas is.  As a matter of fact the Gas problem will continue to get more serious as men become gassed through their carelessness & in some cases deliberately as they see that it means evacuation to England with little pain if carried out well.  Of course some die but it actually is, what is known as, a safe blighty.  Heard today that Major Metcalfe was killed in his dressing station, he was a particularly fine man & one of the best officers we have ever had.
Saturday 27th AprilHad a very busy morning.
The 60th Btn hopped over to straighten out the line & copped very heavy although. The operation was a success.  The remainder of the day was quiet & ordinary & I even had time to wash a couple of shirts & socks and write a letter in the evening.  No papers though or news so things must be very quiet.
Sunday 28th AprilA very quiet day for wounded.  Very busy in the morning arranging  two rooms so as to be able to carry on operations
