 
The 50th Battalion moved from Steenvoorde today back to St. Omar, to undergo a school of instruction, so I suppose we will still continue to hang on here for some time.

Later.

It is snowing in England & we are getting the wind off it, consequently it is dam cold. The weather has again broken & it is pouring down in torrents.

I had quite an interesting yarn with an ex Royal Navy Officer (J Chesney) who was present at the bombardment of Lao Chou & & enjoyed every word of same.

18.9.16 Monday

The rain has been coming down in torents all day long & does not show any signs of abating at all. I am living fairly well at present & actually had a plate of stored mushrooms for tea tonight. I have occasion to send a few men out daily for green forage & they always search round for them.. This item will provide us with many decent meals in future as they grow in fairly large quantities in this district.

I received letters from home today & deeply regret to learn that Dallas Green has died of wounds. I am afraid that there will be many sorry homes in far away Australia
