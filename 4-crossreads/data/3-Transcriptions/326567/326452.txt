<p>of the night picket, I now occupy the Tent which the Company's Bootmaker does his work in, he sleeps in the Tent &amp; being an old friend of his, he invited me to keep him Company, his name is Corporal G. Wiltshire &amp; a good companion so were are very comfortable being the only two in the Tent. I can have a good rest every day. I take up my duties at 9 Pm I can always have a few hours rest in the early Morning.<br/>Thursday 7/6/17<br/>Our Friends the Canadian Broad Guage operating Company No 58 received word to pack up &amp; be ready to march out of Camp at 9 am. They were very busy this morning getting ready &amp; we mingled amongst them saying Good Bye to several Boys who had been great chums while in our lines. They are very much like us in their ways &amp; habits. Their Twang amused us very much. They use the words Gard Darne very frequent &amp; Sure &amp; I Guess, when I am having a Chat with them their Twang amuses me as a rule more than the yarn they tell. All our boys like them very much &amp; we trust to meet them again.</p>
