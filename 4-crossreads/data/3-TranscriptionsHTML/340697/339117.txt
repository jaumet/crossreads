<p>trenches in front of our position last night. We captured two prisoners and killed 13. Our casualties were 1 killed and 16 wounded. Most of these casualties we caused through shell fire in No Mans Land. This is the first time a raid has been attempted without the enemies barb wire being cut. Our telephone wires were cut and the only communication that was kept I carried across on foot 29.6.16</p>
<p>We paraded for inspection</p>
