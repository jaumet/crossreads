<p>Wentworth Chambers, 180 Phillip Street, Sydney. 4th June 1965.<br/>The Honourable Mr. Justice Keith Ferguson, Supreme Court, Sydney.<br/>Sir, The scene this morning was one which, if I may say so in relation to yourself, moved me as much indeed as I am sure it moved you.<br/>I recall as a very junior member of the bar having been opposed to you in a building case in the District Court.<br/>I had the impertinence at the time to believe that I should win that case upon the basis of some authorities which in my immaturity had not been properly digested.<br/>From such occasion I learned to read the books more carefully.<br/>May I also recall that on an occasion when I was seeking a certain appointment you furnished me with a reference which I have treasured ever since.<br/>It has occurred to me that when the formal occasions associated with your retirement from the Bench have passed it may be that the thoughts of an erstwhile junior member of the bar were directed towards yourself. May I in conclusion reiterate the sentiments expressed that you will have a happy and useful retirement. Sincerely yours, [indecipherable] W. May</p>
