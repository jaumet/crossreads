 I am weaker constitutionally then when I arrived.   unless  I could not stand nearly as much now as I could before the Peninsula days.  I hope I pull round in England. Left the wharf last night amid the shouts &amp; cheers of a few yachting parties in the harbour. Anchored near the breakwater for the night just as the Havanford did when I was leaving for the Peninsula.  Swimming party went on last night but it was too dark for my short sight. It is still very hot &amp; I am looking forward to a colder climate.
