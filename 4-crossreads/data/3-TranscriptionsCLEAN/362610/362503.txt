Saturday 14 October 1916Dull & overcast, but no rain until late at night. The Bde. H.Q. had arrived abt. 11 o'c. the previous night, & we had to be up in good timed to have breakfast & get things packed up preparatory to the move. Just before we moved off Jocelyn came along & we were able to have a few minutes yarn. He was looking splendid & I was so glad to see him again. We got away from Busseboom abt. 10 o'c. & this time I was mounted, riding the interpreter's horse. It was abt. 8 mls. march to Steenwoorde, quite a large town close to Cassel : had a very nice billet with an old couple who remembered well the 1870 campaign & who had been compelled  to take refuge in their cellar when the Germans overran this place in Oct. 1914. Delighted to receive a mail of 16 letters.
