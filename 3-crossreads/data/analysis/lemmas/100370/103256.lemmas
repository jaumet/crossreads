 Jaffa , we were go to Ludd , we were go to Rishon , etc. , and we were to have three month spell . It was one of the most fear hot day we had experienc in the Valley , and amid cloud of choke , blind dust we made our way across the plain through Jericho . We were to go up the old road into the hill , but by some mean or other did not turn off and proceed along the new . So we had to turn round and go back and after get to the base of the hill where the old road wound up the mountain , we found out we were to go the new road after all , so then we had onc more to go back .
