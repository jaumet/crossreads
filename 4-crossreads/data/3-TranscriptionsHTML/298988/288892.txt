<p>&amp; we saw three of them commissioned &amp; go out for their trials.  Our navy is a lot more powerful now than 12 months ago.</p>
<p>Had a real good time here, as did all the Officers &amp; I hear there were a lot of fond good-byes last night, but as I'm not interested in that sort of thing I cannot prove the assertion.  Went to West Hartlepool one afternoon, but saw no traces of the German bombardment &amp; also went to Saltburn by the sea through some very pretty moors.</p>
<p>Last weekend I visited Dr &amp; Mrs Taylor at Birmingham 120 miles away.  Had a glorious time there, probably through being about the only sailor (in uniform) up there at that time.  The Dr took me about in his motor &amp; I saw some beautiful buildings, residences, Art Gallery, the very fine markets, &amp; Cadburys big factory at Bournville also a lot of other places of interest in this, the third biggest City in the United Kingdom, Glasgow being second.  The Doctor has a beautiful residence with a fine billiard room attached &amp; he &amp; I &amp; a friend of his had several games.  Also had some music &amp; singing on the Sunday night as they have a very fine Pianola.  We also had a game of hockey.  Mrs Taylor introduced me to a Jeweller &amp; I bought some Jewellery.  This is the biggest Jewellery manufacturing centre in the United Kingdom.  I stayed from Saturday until tuesday &amp; no doubt they are grand people.  I have promised to visit them again on my return &amp; I will certainly do so.</p>
