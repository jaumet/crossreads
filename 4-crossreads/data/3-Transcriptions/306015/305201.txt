<p>a sweet Mademoiselle (of 21 years).   She is very pretty, with pink cheeks and bright eyes and quite captivated me for the time being.   I promised to return &amp; see her again before we left Contay.</p>
<p>May.  20.   Sunday.    Rest in shade by the creek during the forenoon.   After lunch Alan &amp; I walked to St. Gratien Village and after <strike>a cup</strike> having a cup of caf&eacute; we went to the Catholic Church there.    We then walked across to Molliens-aux-bois, had more caf&eacute; &amp; went to church again.  We returned through Beaucourt and arrived at Camp an hour late, but were let off on the first offender's plea.</p>
