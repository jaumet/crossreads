  
 a dinkum issue of rum when we arrived. In our weak state it made us all so sleepy that most of us lay down in the mud and were able to get some sleep there were no shelters of any kind. Have made myself a little home this evening. Rain and snow continues. Mail! Ever welcome Mail was issued. 20/4/17. Have had three days splendid rest here. Everything has been quiet and lovely except for a bit of a disturbance near Lagnicourt. 21/4/17. Gave our blanket in and moved into the line again on the Doignes sector. I don't like the look of this "possie" but I expect it is no worse than some I've been in. Saw the German dead lying in heaps where "B" Coy and the 4th Battalion passed them a week ago.
