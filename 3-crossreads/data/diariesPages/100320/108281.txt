short sharp quick trot like step. The midinettes crowded to the windows over the street and the air was full of acclamations. I stood next to an old vanman in the street. He said "We fete them for they have won after 4 years. Two boys of mine are killed". Returned to hotel passing many beautifully dressed girls. After writing for a while set out again up the street. There were great illuminations tonight. The Opera Square was full of electric signs and the Place Vendome also very gay indeed. Quite a blaze of light everywhere. Went to Arrigonis Café Italiens and dined well having as neighbours at the next table 2 American officers with two girls. All very well oiled. Had a long yarn with them and then pushed off down the thronged and lighted boulevards through the Place Vendome back to hotel. A ¼ bottle Chianti has a great effect on one.
