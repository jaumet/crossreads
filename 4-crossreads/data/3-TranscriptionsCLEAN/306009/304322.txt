  
 1915 May. 16 Sun. Left Mena House about 9.30 am. after being there for 161/2 weeks. Am now installed in the administration Office at Gezireh Palace which is on Gezireh Island beside the bank of the Nile & about a mile from Cairo - the tram fare in being only 2 milliemes (1/2d).  Got to work straight away but could not find much to do - After tea went for a walk through the beautiful public gardens on the Island, splendid! The Palace is a splendid building amid fine surroundings - Much decenter than being out at Mena although not quite so comfortable - but much finer building.
