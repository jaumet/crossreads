And to think that there are women today who intend to desert our men at the Front.  by for Make no mistake if we vote NO we desert those now there & I for one don't cannot see why I should have more thought for the shirker who doesn't go intend to go than for the brave lads who have already risked their lives are even now risking their lives for us & the Empire.There are 2 other points we should not forget that will come into force with Conscripn.  The Exemptions & the married men.  Our primary industries will not be forgotten, men will be spared to carry these on, only sons are not required to go, or boys under 21, sole supports of aged parents & dependents.
