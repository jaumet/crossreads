 Last night the Turks blew up a mine in front of Quinns, although injuring no man in the firing line we suffered 9 killed & 7 wounded in the supports, by falling dirt Another Taube came along this morning & tantalized one of the destroyers but looping the loop for our benefit, then a Sopwith driven by Sampson came along & chased our friend off but he reappeared at 1600 & dropped two bombs on the beach but no damage was done. 2 4.7 landed last night & 3 more 18 pdr all to go on the R.  News came to hand that we had achieved a victory in Persia taking the railway and now the road is open to Bagdad, we gave three cheers & fired 1 round as a Jeux-de-joix & The Turks didn't seem to appreciate it.  Wrote home & to Nell.  Downing leaves tomorrow thank goodness, we have 28 men away ill & wounded.  Got another batch of trophies by seeking after dark. Monitors shelling Chanak 
 31 July 1915 Saturday 
 All through the night a constant rifle fire was kept up by both sides but no attack was launched by either side.  Downing left at 11 AM with the heads for Imbros Went for one usual at 1500 & paid a visit to 706 where quite an interesting sight was seen, the Navy was carving small bits of Achi & it was enveloped in smoke shells were bursting all along our front with great rapidity.  The Taube came over again & let down a rain of [indecipherable] in Canterbury gully but no one was hit.  Turks give our positions a severe bombardment at sundown & our guns give them the same [indecipherable] & the trenches are a picture to see especially the Chess board.  Our 4.7 guns were firing tonight from their special emplacements & are doing splendid work although the Turks have been shelling their positions for hours, but with little or no gain
