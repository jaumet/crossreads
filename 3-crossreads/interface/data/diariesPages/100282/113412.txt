they repeated it over over again that this stunt was carried out solely by Imperial troops no Colonials whatever were engaged in it, this was about the only stunt that Colonials have not have had a hand in, what a gutser the Imperial troops came in the end, it has turned out a dismal failure about the worst defeat in one way that has happened to Britain in this war thank heaven no Colonials were in it, though a lot of Australian artillery have been taken down there in the last few weeks, I guess the London papers are rather sorry they spoke so hastily, for it has only improved the Colonials prestige.
22nd. Temperature is rather milder today which is very welcome after the perishing cold of the last few days.
Have been utilising my time by writing have been getting off some back correspondence. Saw a fight this morning 2 of the AMC. chaps had a row they settled it in good old British style.
