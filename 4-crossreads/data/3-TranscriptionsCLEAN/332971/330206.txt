  
 times you have fulfilled your duties and helped to make our Hospital the Great success it is.  I am leaving to take my place Lt Colonel de Crespigny and feel you will extend to him the same loyal obedience as you did towards me. T.H.Fiaschi 
 I went across to bed him farewell.  He was very sad & depressed.  I thought what a shame.  It has all been too much - to see him the man he was & the man he is.  Later he was carried away on a stretcher to the "H.S. Maurtania for England.  We fear he will not return, and the general opinion is that he will not live to reach England, but somehow I feel that now he is relieved of worry & anxiety & then the anticipation of seeing his Wife & baby in England to meet him, that it will greatly help him.  We trust so anyway & can only wait with patience to hear.  Our Unit is breaking up fast especially amongst the Officers & men.  We Sisters on the whole are standing it much better than they.  Out of all the 7 Lt Colonels only 2 are left & those are Colonel Cudmore & de Crespigny.  The former now is sick & I expect when he is sufficiently well to travel he will go too.  It all makes one reflect.  I was so pleased to be able to take a snap of Colonel the day before he went away, he just managed with help to crawl to the door of his tent.  I knew how pleased Mrs Fiaschi would be.  Truly
