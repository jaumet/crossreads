I hope they come up for they are a fine large variety. Cookhouse has just blown, so I guess I will soon have to stop, Today there has been a swimming carnival on just down the river. I got tired of watching and came back here to write letters. This paper is German I salvaged it from the H. Qrs of one of the Hun Battery Commanders. "The Schwer Grupp" or I suppose the "Right Group" or right flank of the artillery division. we got his Telephones, some of his maps a few other odds and ends not worth having next time I hope we catch the joker himself. Now I must stop heaps of love to all, and a Special Share for Yourself and Bett from Your Loving Son Chas G. P.
N.B.
Some time ago a parcel arrived packed by McIllwraith, who sent it I dont know, so dont know who to thank for it. it arrived just as we were moving to the front line, up north it has not been mentioned in any letters that I have received so far.
Chas.
Please Thank Bett for her letters
