<p>98 December 10th<br/>There is also a Hockey ground here, once used as a tennis court &ndash; The grounds of the lager are very spacious &amp; I really think this is a better camp than Freiburg. It has more conveniences &amp; the whole camp is administered &amp; organised in a very systematic way &ndash;</p>
<p>100 french officers left this morning per another camp, &amp; there now remains very few Frenchmen.</p>
<p>100 English officers arrived from Karlsruhe tonight &ndash; all roped in at Cambrai, Colonels, MOs, padres &amp; all ranks to a S Lieut.

<p>Played Bridge &ndash;</p>
<p>December 18th<br/>Recd 2 parcels. Walked round square with Tremlott &amp; Stones. We have a roulette school here &amp; have endless fun of a night. I am getting settled more settled now, reconciling myself to my new surroundings. Had yarn with Cull &amp; Mc.</p>
<p>General Plumber has gone to Italy to command the Ango French troops there &ndash; a French train accomodating 1000 French soldiers going on leave, was derailed when half way through a tunnel when an explosion followed &ndash; 900 were killed. The accident is said to be the</p>
