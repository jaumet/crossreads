back again. Poor Sergeant did look silly & we were so rude as to laugh at him, because he was so fond of telling us that "you'll learn someday". He learned anyhow. His heart's pride was his moustache - a bonzer cricketer's - eleven a side - like a doll's tooth brush. To our delight, he was put out of the saloon - not because of his "giddy giddy gout act" - & had to dine with the men. In the afternoon two transports were picked up with the cruiser Minnetaur, the three of which came from Perth.
4th November. During the afternoon the second officer began his tricks that brought some furious words from Teddy & I. He always came & woke Teddy at 4pm when he finished his watch. I protested but he continued "on the bounce" & Teddy took it all without a murmur. He tried it on me later on but I threatened him with sudden death. Teddy & I then slipped into the third officer's room & would have a chat while Captain Jackson was asleep. At night we would get the phonograph & Teddy would sing to it - breaking all records (not literally). He had a bonzer voice like a nanny goat.
