1 May  MondayA beautiful day.  Sea rather choppy  detailed for latrine picket until 5 pm.  Mock parliament held on port side of promenade deck in afternoon evening & proved a great success.  Some of the Officers took part in it & there was a large attendance.  500 is now favourite game on cards.
2 TuesdayPassed Gates of Hell about 8 am.  Passed Aden 2.30am. also passed a good few Islands during the day including Gabel Tier Island [?] (a wonderful Island)"Suffolk" in sight all day passed it about 8 pm. Sea very choppy.  Gabel Tier Island is only a very large & very high rock with a light on top of it, it seems a very lonely place.
3 WednesdayLost sight of "Suffolk" in evening.  Went on" full marching order" parade at 10 am.  General inspection of reinforcements held at 10 am.  Rather a cloudy day. Sea very calm. Sports held on promenade deck in afternoon (poor attendance) & concert given by reinforcements at night, which was very good, a couple of items was also given by some of the shops crew.
