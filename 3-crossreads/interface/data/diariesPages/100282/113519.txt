to be just a mass of villages farms, it is very thickly populated swinging down the hill at a good rattling pace we struck the Locre Dickebusch road this we followed till we pulled up at De-Zon Camp here we are comfortably installed, but only for tonight tomorrow we move again, right into the line. 
Looks very threatening outside tonight a light rain is starting to fall hope it dont rain too much while we are in the trenches, though of course we are due for some wet weather.
Sid Harris left us just as we were marching away from our billets this morning, he is going to England on the 6 months stunt, struck it at a good time just as the Battn are going in for their cut. While we were playing "bridge" tonight having a bit of good old fun over it, a runner came round from B.O.R. with a message saying that I had to report to Mr Forrest at 8.30 in the morning full marching order
