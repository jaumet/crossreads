Friday 24th, Christmas EveBusy pulling down tents & packing up.  We received a splendid issue of stuff.  An Xmas billly & pudding between two men, also tinned fruit milk etc, more than we could eat.  Received a visit from some friends & after tea visited their camp.  About 9 oclock we had a supper of cake, beers wine champaygnes & Brandy the latter I donated for which act the company sang "For he's a jolly good fellow etc".  Although the drinks were much mixed we had a real good evening with sing song speeches etc.  We also received an issue of Red X goods, a mixed lot for which we recei drew by ballot.  The excitement & pleasure attached to opening our billies was worth seeing.  Shrieks of laughter & cheering could be heard from all sides & the reading of enclosed letters caused great sport.  I "tossed up" with a friend for my letter & lost.  The contents of the billies was varied but useful & ranged from tobacco to pins.  Pencils, paper, lollies, cigarettes, laces, knifes, mouth organs & so on.  The puddings were splendid & proved a treat indeed.
A second issue of food stuff to us consisted of tinned fruit, milk
