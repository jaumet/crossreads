if he sees a working or fatigue party, he immediately shells them, also he has machine guns posted, probably along way back, which at intervals he turns on just on the off chance of getting someone, and they are responsible for more casualties than the shells, as he has them laid so as to sweep say, the parapet of his old trench, or some patch in No Mans Land. Last night an American who just came up to have a look at things, was killed by one. Fritz keeps up a constant succession of Flares, some of which are very beautiful & are different signals that he has. The plain white ones are for light, then he has red, green, and orange, some in singles, some in two & threes, some burst into bunches of separate lights. So far I have not seen a light fired from our lines, there is no need to. In Fritzs trench there are is naturally, lots of his gear lying about, Rifles Ammunition, Clothing & private stuff. It had all been gone over for Souvenirs by the Aussies
