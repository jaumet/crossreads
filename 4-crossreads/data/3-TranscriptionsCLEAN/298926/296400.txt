"O hut in which ensconced have I          Full many a happy evening passed           And there defied the chilling breeze    But now, Alas, It is the last
I've laid and listened to the rage,                         Of angry winds and torrents pour                   And pitied those who braved the storm          While we were snug inside your door
But now, O hut the call has come                  And we must float out on the tideWhere duty wafts her braver sons                   And Comrades call us to their side
So Farewell, may your cosy walls           Embrace and welcome once again                                                 The ones to whom the call has come         They'll prove you have not served in vain
