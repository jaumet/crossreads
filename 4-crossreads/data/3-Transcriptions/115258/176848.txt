<p>That Mr Pearse seems to be a nice sort of a chap. Poor old Dick introduced me to his brother when I was at the signal school. His brother manages Liptons. If I come accross the Jordan Rifles again I&#39;ll look up his son. I was working with them a couple of days before your letter came but they have gone in for a spell now. Mother sent me a card of introduction to Miss Harnett of the Cairo Gifts fund which I will present next time I go in there. The YMCAs the Gift Store and the Anzac hostel do great work for the troops in Cairo especially as nearly all the decent pubs are only in bounds to officers - butI prefer staying at a hotel if there is one - the other places are too much like camp life. This is a jolly good camp we are in now, over the Jordan a bit from Jericho - its quite hot down here and the river is not bad to swim in, although it is pretty muddy after having been in flood</p>
