10 - should like photographs of you all. I feel I may not be home for many months yet unless of course I get ill - but I hope not to do that till anyway the war is over.I'd love a print of gum trees something to hang up in my tent. I really need very little. The clothes, riding skirt & I suppose my brown boots went down in some ship for I never received them & Jocelyn says she sent them. I need boots - most of all - would you ask Callaghan to make me a black pair of calf leather like they made me when I left in May last year - thick soles. Mr Robin knows how I like them - also a pair of calf shoes - black - the same as he always make not on any account to try and put patent leather toe caps on.
