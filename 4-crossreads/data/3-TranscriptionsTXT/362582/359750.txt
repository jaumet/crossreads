 My dear old Jane, Received your most welcome letter Friday night No 7. Strange to say the only one from Australia to me. I have received papers from Mr Osburne but no letters. Papers from Mrs Roddick &amp; a letter. Papers from Mollie &amp; letter. I pass my papers on to Charlie, which he is very pleased to receive, he is a great boy &ndash; helps everyone in the ward and does ever so much writing for the Sister but he never says a word about what he does. Poor boy is improving steadily but will be months before he is able to do much. 11.30p.m. Really this is a desperate place to write, cannot get  quiet corner to one's self. Began this letter about 9p.m. when one poor soul who felt homesick came along to tell me all her troubles. I'm most fortunate at present with friends &amp; have heaps of invitations to go out. Dorothy has just returned
