  
 Monday 27 December, 1915 
 Went out to Pieta to see Mrs Grundy & Paula. Took their photos & had a good time. They all had to go out after tea so I stayed & minded the house till they came home at about 9.30. We then stayed & yarned till 11.30 when I started to walk home, 4 miles, I brought home a bottle of Scotch for the boys & we all started in & nearly finished it at about 1 a.m. when I got home.
