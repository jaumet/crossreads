  
 In the tent Was just thinking how much I liked writting to you and Father, Mother dear, I think I could write books home if there was only something to talk about & My Word I like getting your letters too I gess. We are having a really splendid time at present, not a bit like the awful times people imagine; most beautiful weather, cloudless days & nights, not very hot days and nights just cold enough to like blankets.  We get up about 6 o'clock and all we have to do is feed & water our horses and feed ourselves and we get jolly good tucker, far better than Liverpool, and there is no ceremony or orders or anything & we are all a happy family. The flies are not really bad & there is no dust & we just lie round & smoke & read yarn & write letters all day and I have never felt better in my life.  Of course we get touches of Home sickness now & again but one of your happy letters always puts me right again straight away. While I think of it, would you send me a couple of woolen vests, they say the nights are very cold here in winter, but anyway vests are always very useful the silk shirts will be nice too. I have never received a paper from home since I left (got 2 Australians from Alan) but parcels seem to come alright.  Got a letter from Mrs Nicholl with yours.  Jack Glennie gets the Guardian every week & hands it on to me so I am not missing it altogether.
