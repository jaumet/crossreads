Heidelberg is prettily situated among the hills, but the portion of the town I saw was not inviting.   It was merely a modern railway depot of some importance;  - "Alte Heibelberg" of fiction is certainly not on view from the train.
The train filled with troops here, & I spent the two hours to Karlsruhe in the darkened train (we are in the air-raid zone) in altering the opinions of some poor devils who think the war will be over in three months with the Huns in Paris and London!
