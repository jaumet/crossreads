  
 12-8-16 Sat 12th Had another days good rest today & everything seems clear so far as Turks are concerned   a few of our men were sent out this morning to bury the dead around Bir-El-Abd & to collect anything that is lying about;  One or two of the lads killed a couple of days ago were stripped of boots & gear but otherwise they were not touched   only men belonging to the 1st & 2nd Bde could be found & all these had been reported dead when we retired, these were buried, & all gear left by us recovered; 
 On account of our horses getting cut up on the 4th only two Squadrons from each Regt could get mounted & one Sqd of the 3rd Regt came with us to make us up to strength & one Squadron of the 3rd went with the 2nd
