<p>Mena House<br/>The Pyramids<br/>Egypt.<br/>10 March 1915</p>
<p>My dear Mollie:/</p>
<p>3 p.m.  A bundle of letters has just come in to the office from Australia.  Wonder are there some for me amongst them.  I shall possess my soul in patience for a few minutes.  Then if there be none.  Why then!  Why this letter will be continued without having at this stage reply to sentences from you.</p>
<p>Today, this morning, a letter came from Frank Fox, formerly of Sydney to me  He was in Belgium during the time that the Germans were hacking away though the brave people who so gallantly stemmed the onward rush of the well trained battalions of Emperor William III.  He wrote an article in the "XIX Century &amp; After" Magazine describing his experience, terrible as they were.  Of one person, a demented young priest, driven mad by his experiences, he wrote that waking at night this young man's face and form came up before him &amp; recalled the dreadful scenes.</p>
<p>3.5 p.m.  A letter for me.  From you?  No.  From Senator Pearce, the Minister for Defence in Melbourne, dated Melbourne 3rd Febry.  Is it possible that there is not one from home for me.  Causes the thought:&ndash;  Have they forgotten all about me in Macquarie St, &amp; in Maitland.</p>
<p>All the letters have been sorted and not one from home.  This is the 10th March.  We may be away in a few days then a letter will probably be something unseen for months.  However it is in the game &amp; I suppose that it is of no use complaining.</p>
