<p>They appear to be Howitzers. German aeroplane over this morning. We fired 20 shots at them, some close, others miles away. The Royal Naval Division are going to the trenches now. The enemy landed a shot or two into hospital tents. The new hospital started a day or so ago has grown to 31 tents<br/>7/10/1915<br/>Fine weather still prevails, flies still troublesome. Shells over in our lines this morning, in fact it was a small bombardment. Another aerial duel this morning at 11.30, not so exciting as the last one. You cannot find out the result, you hear a machine gun rattle and see the aeroplanes circle around one another, and then you see some shells bursting about them, eventually they disperse, one going one way and one another. It is marvelous the little damage that is done by their shooting. With all of their shooting today, I don't suppose they wounded a single man although I saw a shot land in the middle of a crowd of men, one or two got knocked over, but they got up laughing. Reinforcements for R.H.A. and R.F.A arrived this morning from Mudros</p>
