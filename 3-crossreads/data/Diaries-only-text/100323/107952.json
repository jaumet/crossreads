1/8/19 Cape Town
even more dead than before. Stayed on the boat until after dinner and then with the Master took a cab up the town. All decorated for peace celebrations tomorrow and at the Standard Bank of South Africa a stand erected to view the procession. Some fine well stocked shops. Saw a fair performance of Peter Pan at the Opera House and then went to "Maximes" for supper. Comment here on the cheapness of meals. If it were not for the impressive and unusual Table Mountain I should feel inclined to say that Cape Town would be a dull and ugly place. The natives are poor weedy wretched looking folk.
