<p>who were killed in action<br/>The latest report to hand is that the Taube which flew over Salmana and neighbouring places was badly hit and as reported yesterday she dropped 4 bombs which was correct  but she dropped them about 2 miles from anywhere to lighten the load and was seen by the advanced post {52 Division) to be slowly going down. Surely our gunners have not established an unprecedented record?<br/>7pm. Just handed in the Daily "Signallers parade state" which sets forth Officers  1   NCOs 4   Other Ranks 12   Total 17  Horses 18<br/>Lance Corporal Campbell was thrown from his horse at Kantara when we were there and suffered considerable injuries so he has been left behind. I hope he comes along soon as we cannot afford to lose good men we have not got too many. Have been informed today that 6 signallers will probably be required next week for outpost duty some where out in front  we are about 7 or 8 miles inland and away from the sea and in tonights orders appears a notification to the effect that all submarines which are seen to be immediately reported. On the face of things it seems the height of nonsence. But the order has come from General Head Quarters and is addressed to All Troops concerned particularly those near the coast</p>
