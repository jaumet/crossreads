  
 the difficult task of the boys & bore it all. 
 I bid your Son adieu, all the time I was in Hospital I was thinking of him, I wrote him several times & before I left I heard from him. 
 I have been anxious about him since as I heard he was badly wounded (I sincerely hope this is not the case) would you kindly let me know as I would like to meet Bob on his return.  My one ambition when in Hospital was to get back to make some return to those boys especially your Son for whom I thought the job was so strenuous. 
 Until I have the pleasure of meeting him, would you kindly accept my sincere wishes for his safe return to you, & you may well feel proud of a Son who has not only rendered valuable services to his country, but to a comrade when in distress. 
 With kind Regards, I remain, Yours Sincerely F. Bailey, Pte. 2nd Battalion.
