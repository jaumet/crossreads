<p>Evacuated Gallipoli 18 December 1915.</p>
<p>3 January 1916 Mon<br/>6.30 a.m. broke camp &amp; left for the wharf. A very tiring march &amp; suffering with very bad tooth. Awful cold &amp; windy waiting for the steamboat to take us out to the T.S.S. Manitou. Twentyth Battalion on board also 5th Field engineers also 600 horses. Accommodation rotten lot of the boys sleep in the horseboxes. Good to get in hammocks again.</p>
<p>4 January 1916 Tues<br/>Still in port at Lemnos lying out in stream with H.M.S. Chatham alongside also several other ships of war close by. Several well dressed civillian men &amp; women prisoners on board by what I could gather is that they were captured in Salonica. Bill Amphlett finds a pair of extractors &amp; gets rid of my tooth. The pain was awful.</p>
