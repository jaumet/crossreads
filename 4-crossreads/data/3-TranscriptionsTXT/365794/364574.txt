Friday 21st June 1917 [1918]1/2 day & go out to Pyramids with Cpl. Shaw, poor old man he coughs & is very bent & weak after his illness, photos, then tea at Mena House, then long enjoyable evening lying on the hot sands & watching the colors in the sky & the Sphinx in the moonlight & dreaming & all it has seen in the long past ages.  Home by last tram 11.10 p.m. & find everyone has been looking for me to say may stay in bed more, so no more shall I go on duty in the 27th G.H. & what a lot I have learned here, not in nursing but other things.  (Saturday 22nd), cont. from overleaf.  Moonlight donkey stunt to [indecipherable].  24 of us & how we enjoyed it all, playing 2 & 3's round the old obelisk in the warm evening air & flying in a car along the fine roads with lebbek [also spelt lebbeck] trees on either side.
