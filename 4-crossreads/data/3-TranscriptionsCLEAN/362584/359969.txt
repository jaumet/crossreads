Dear Mrs Ferguson
You will not know me by name & perhaps will not remember me even by sight, but I felt I should like to send you this extract to show what one of his boys thought of him your son. I felt heartsick for you when the awful news came I am sure all we mothers of the 20th were in great sympathy with you.
This is put in boy language but it will just give you an idea what a fine example he gave to our boys.
May you be helped to bear this terrible loss, only we Mothers can tell what suffering it is for you.
Don't bother to reply I shall understand.
Yours truly
Nellie Spedding.
My fountain pen seems out of order but you will excuse. My nerves are very bad as I write also badly.
