31 December 1914Thursday
Reveille at 6.
Stables under [indecipherable] Latham has come back & commences to make himself obstreperous by picking out simple little faults.  Riding follows under [indecipherable] & he as usual does his nut he galloped for miles & then comes down to the {indecipherable] after lunch I went out again under [indecipherable] this time we went over to [indecipherable] the men as usual go for an exploring trip whilst Bert & I make plans for the future .  Nell comes into it of course , The L Horse have been putting in splendid work all day they now are working in squadrons. After Tea Teddy gets his first lesson in [indecipherable] he gets only 3 falls & then a drunk shoves him - over head the boss ordered me to avert them which I did but at the time I didn't at all like the job, the main guard form the gate arrest him.  Good bye 1914 & the last thoughts of mine were for dear Nell & Mother at home
