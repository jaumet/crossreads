<p>of the best chaps I&#39;ve ever come across, an English Lance corporal. Aubrey was asking a chap at the Y.M.C.A. if he could get any hot water to make some tea, &amp; this lance corporal, overhearing his question, went over to him &amp; told him to go along to where he was, &amp; he&#39;d fix him up with tea &amp; butter. He told Aub to bring me too. We went along, &amp; talk about comfortable! there are some good jobs in the army anyway. This lance corporal &amp; an Australian corporal have a room to themselves in a French house, have comfortable bunks, a table, fireplace &amp; coal fire, &amp;c. They are attached to the Purchase Dept, buy hay from the French farmers &amp; have it trucked up to the line for the horses, &amp; such work. Well this English lance corporal made some tea for us, gave us sugar, butter &amp; bread, &amp; boiled some water for us to have a good wash. Of course, he could do this easily, as they are so comfortable here, but still he went out of his way in the crowded Y.M.C.A. to speak to Aubrey, &amp; no woman could have</p>
