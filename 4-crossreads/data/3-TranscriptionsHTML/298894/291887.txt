<p>anchor about 1 P.M.  Several barges loaded with coal in bags now approached also water boats &amp; a start was made coaling.  The coolies seemed numberless &amp; were dressed with a dirty sheet wrapped round the middle.  Several of the men commenced diving for money &amp; were so quick that they always recovered it before it sank more than a few feet  Tins of Bully Beef were freely passed out to the Coolies one of which struck one of the men on the head &amp; made a gash.  Judging by the dint in the tin it would have killed a white man.  The coaling is done very rapidly being passed up by the men on to various platforms  The water is pumped up from huge tanks in barges with "Waeter Boat" painted on them.  The Seang Bee arrived 7 hrs after we did &amp; took a birth close alongside.  Our appendicitis patient was sent ashore being placed on a bed &amp; hoisted onto a launch alongside.  Two of our men accompanied the doctor ashore &amp; had a good time coming back laden with good things &amp; excitement.</p>
<p>Tuesday 9th  The heads decided on a Route March  &amp; we landed by means of several barges.  Myself &amp; another went with M.O. to get supplies &amp; were given leave for a few hours.  The other troops marched out &amp; returned</p>
