  
 night in Alexandria with McWhirter. One finds oneself in queer positions now & again in a job such as we had then. I remember one night at 11 o'clock making an excellent supper off tinned salmon & beer clad in my shirt on the wharf at Alexandria. Another afternoon not 200 yds away Yeats & I took afternoon tea with a young lady of the Red X who sold tea & cakes on the wharf. & so on & so forth. 
 Monday July 10th Just arrived back from a stunt last night. We started at 2 o'clock
