<p>some arrangement the Aus Government made then they only charge the 1d.  Well on opening Mrs Titteringtons letter this morning I found a Postal Note. I thought it awfully good of her. I met her as a perfect stranger last time across here wounded. That reminds me I hope you receive my letter asking you to see if the Saving Bank would transfer money across to me through the Commonwealth Bank. I hope they will shall need it more now as shall get fourteen day furlough after leaving Hospital &amp;amp: don't want to be like last time. Had to count the pense so I shouldint go broke before my leave was up. Must close now Father want to write Miss Smith shall give her a discription of the Hospital  etc Love to all your sincere son Clyde</p>
