She couldn't speak English, I could speak enough French to tell her what I wanted, but when she rattled out her answers, she had me. I told her we wanted fried potatoes for 4. She poured water in a saucepan to imitate boiling the spuds, & pointed to the fat in the pan & said it was "tres chere", but finally I got her to cut up some spuds and fry them for a franc. To show how well we made ourselves understood by each other, I learned that her husband is wounded through the head & in hospital at Paris, she is 32 years old & has 1boy & 1girl. We had bully beef, fried potatoes & tea. In the stall next door some French kiddies are playing, & fowls are scratching on the straw in our billet. We made some tea again at tea-time. These places in the French villages are funny - the barns surround the houses, & cows & fowls & pigs are fed near the front door, & live
