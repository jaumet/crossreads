 Wednesday 1-11-16 Very short of tucker yesterday.  Short again today.  No Breakfast.  Ration cart has been away 36 Hours & not returned yet.  On Monday we were walking up to our Knees in water & with very little tucker.  The congestion on our Roads here is something awfull. 
 Thursday 2-11-16 Working on the Road near Longueval Circus Water Point.  Up to our Knees in mud carrying & picking up stones to put on the Roads.  No Bread for Dinner but that is common now.  Fritz caught 5 Horses with a shell last night.  I was watching a 8.2 Howitzer Battery today and could distinctly see the shells leave the gun & traverse about 3/4 of its journey.  We are working alongside Longueval Wood.
