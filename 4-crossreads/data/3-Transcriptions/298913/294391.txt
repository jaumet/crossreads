<p>22/4/16<br/>Saturday night 11pm instead of having lights out &amp;asleep the boys were playing cards. The major happened to come around &amp; caught the tent behind ours. Our light went out before he saw it but B in the tent next to ours let out a few choice words. The major immediately called out &ndash; fall out the man that used that word -. Nobody moved in our tent so he came &amp; made us all get dressed &amp; fall out. We were absolutely innocent &amp; B &ndash; had not the pluck to own up so we got pack drill &amp; were called liars fools &amp; pigs by the major. Frank Gow answered him back &amp; he roared at him &amp; sent us back. In the end we beat him &amp; next morning  23/4/16  we had to sign papers give evidence etc etc just because he major heard our tent use the language. Spent the day writing letter.</p>
