 10.8.15 Tues. 10th.  The Turks have been counter attacking on 971 our artillery has been doing great work all the morning, it is estimated by the Artillery officer that the Artillery accounted for between 1,000 &amp; 2,000 Turks to-day, our machine gun on Popes also accounted for a large number of Turks who were formed up behind Quinns Post, a party was sent up the Bloody Angle last night &amp; succeded in getting another wounded man &amp; 3 dead men down, the dead had been gone through by the Turks &amp; the identification discs taken, &amp; were unrecognisable through decomposition.  All the transport drivers arrived here from Alexandria yesterday, Plushy amongst them, our mail was sunk while coming ashore on a barge last Sunday.  I believe Tancred &amp; Barrow were mentioned in despatches for bravery in carrying out bombs when the attack was on.
