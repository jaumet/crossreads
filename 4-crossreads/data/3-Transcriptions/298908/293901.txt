<p>6th.  Have had a dreadful day splitting headaches &amp; crook all over don't scarcely care what happens.  I lay in the one place for exactly 7 hours today &amp; was incapable of moving even if I wanted to do so, so sick was I, but tonight thank heaven there is a slight improvement, how the old tub is rolling something dreadful bangs the world I don't know what she wouldn't do if she struck a real heavy sea.<br/>Saw a couple of whales spouting today we could not see them too plain for they were a fair way off &amp; heavy rollers kept on obscuring them.<br/>One could notice the difference in the air today compared to yesterday it was quite [indecipherable] &amp; the sun shone nearly the whole day.</p>
