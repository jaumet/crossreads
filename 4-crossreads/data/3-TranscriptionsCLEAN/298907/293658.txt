  
 lovely & green, lots of people come out here from the city, there is a fine restaurant & garden here also, & a walk though the grounds is something to be remembered. 
 Had another bonza afternoon, met our girls again at the 5 Ways, & then walked down to the Botanical Gardens, they are very small but nicely laid out, after strolling round a while we selected a nice grassy little patch & sat down for the rest of the afternoon & done a bit of spooning, practicising of course for the time the right girl comes along, I have been very bashful & shy in the past you know so I am rapidly making up leeway, I only wish I had started before for I can see what a good time I have missed, never mind
