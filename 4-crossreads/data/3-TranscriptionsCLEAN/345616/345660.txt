  
 full of women with Pox when they left they liberated these poor creatures & as they were starving a lot of the 1st Divi caught it through giving them food & being kind to them the Girls reciprocated in the only way the [indecipherable] & there you are. This place is a mass of ruins, unlike the Towns we have come through for here the last stand on this front was made & it was mostly our shells that did the damage  It was bombarded 3 times & Bombed  3 little Boys eldest about 9 were telling us yesterday that one of their mothers had just had a [indecipherable] turn. An old woman & little girl came walking in yesterday looking for their home but found it a heap of rubble, Poor things sat down in the mud  & started to moan & cry when the Boys took her away & gave her Tea & food & this happens all day long the Lorries are full of returning french & belgiums who have been Prisoners of Years. In the Towns coming here, at night time when the People heard us marching, out went their lights the fear is still on them of the hun altho/ they know that hun is gone. & when they invite you to have coffee with them they stand round waiting on you such is 4 years slavery. They are delighted to see us & are all smiles but what Tragedy lies behind it all.
