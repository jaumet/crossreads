<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our method in improving our defences when Fritz has some land that was desirable, &#39;twas to raid his posts, clean them out and then advance our line to the position of command, thus at one spot, our front line there became our support line, quite a novel means of securing depth in defences but without doubt an effective one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we have been out Fritz has sent a Company over to retake one such section of trench, now a company is 250 men, 200 lie about No Man&#39;s Land dead or have crawled or scattered back and the rest with three officers are in our prison cages and casualty clearing stations.&nbsp; Not bad, eh! and although Fritz put over quite a heavy bom-bardment, still our casualties were extremely slight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But here our only visitants are his night bomb-ing planes and occasional shells from his high velocity long range guns, which the boys call the Rubber Gun, for the sound of the gun usually precedes the explosion by only a few seconds, still these are aimed by map at such targets as cross-roads, and when we know that they are targets we just avoid them and all is well.&nbsp; The sector which our battalion held when in the line was a well-wooded valley and Fritz frequently turned gas shell on to it for because of its being walled in and the <sub>^</sub><sup>many</sup> trees <s>there</s> it was a very favourable target for gas and he could quickly produce a concentration, and it would not blow away or dissipate.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Our Box Respirators are proof against his gasses and when timely warning is given nothing need be feared from</p>
