  
 the pipe you sent me last Xmas and so far have heard no rude remarks passed, as to its aroma. 
 No  mail  news from you or Kitty this mail, I think that a good many letters get lost coming back from the Unit.  I am in an infantry battalion at present doing their drill, till I go to the Art. details Camp which I hope will be soon. 
 Best wishes, Your affect. Son, George
