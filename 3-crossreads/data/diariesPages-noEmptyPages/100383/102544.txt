October & November 1916

Friecourt. Next morning we were on the move again & went as far as the hill to the right of Marmetz Wood were we stayed in canvas huts for a couple of days & while there met a lot of boys from the old town & district. While there we had our packs & felt hats taken from us & was issued with extra ammunition & two bombs & two sandbags each. When we moved off on the 29th we were ready equiped for the firing line but only went to a trench between Delville & Irones Woods & there were no dug outs & had to set to & make ourselves shelter. The following following night it rained & came through our roof & we passed a miserable night but next morning set too & made our dug out rain proof & dried it. While here I saw a 15in Howitzer in action which fired a shell 4 ft 6 ins long 14 cwt & cost £450 & it was a great sight to see. On the afternoon of the 1st of November we moved to a reserve trench a little to the west of the village of Flers & two companies went into the firing line & support trench. Next day the 2nd accompied with a couple of N.C.Os I went to supports to have a look round & while on the way saw several of our famous tanks which had been put out of action
