 Dull to drizzling. Fairly busy - night and day. Got official news that "Bagdad" had fallen. Good news comes in about our sector too - " Irles " & several other Villages captured. Dispensers busy all night testing water, which we think the Germans have been poisoning - it is Arsenic if anything. Orders are also out about any eatables that Fritz has left behind him. Also forbidding any of the Village residents back in our region to supply troops with bread. Sent Cables to Mrs O'Kelly & J. O'Hagan contradicting report of having been wounded.

 Thursday 15/3/17 Fairly good day - Aeroplanes up most of the day. Artillery very active . Went over and inspected a big naval 12 inch
