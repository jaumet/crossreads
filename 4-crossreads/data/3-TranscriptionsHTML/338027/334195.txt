<p>Tuesday, 15 June, 1915<br/>Two night ago a trawler was sunk by a floating mine just outside the harbour only one was lost we took the survivors in and reclothed them.  All we do all day is swim, eat, gamble &amp; sleep and wander over this quaint but beautiful historic island, we are having an ideal holiday but it hurts to know that only a few miles away our mates are getting knocked down, but our Capt returned from Anzac to-day and said that we would only be in the way as there was not enough work to do for those that were there were four ambulance corps on the beach just waiting &amp; laying off and twice they have had their tent division shelled from Achi Baba, the Austs are still holding out and enjoying it but dead Turks accumulated every night, Achi Baba has not fallen yet, it is considered a 2nd Gibraltar.  The advance from Cape Hellas is slow but sure.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 16 June.<br/>They have got us doing all the fatigues for other hospitals now, and we buck against it, we are doing everything from digging graves down the cemetery to tent erecting for the No 2 S.H.  Wireless news says that we lost another cruiser near Austria &ndash; the Dublin &ndash; things are still quiet at Anzac but this week there is going to be a big attack, a 2nd Waterloo.  The sooner we get off this island the better as we are liable to  contract more serious danger than the firing line, since we have been here every man has become lousy from the Col downwards, no matter how often you wash &amp; change clothes they get just as bad the whole island is creeping.  The Turks attacked at Gaba Tepe lost 10,000 men.<br/>[The Dublin was damaged but not sunk off Albania by Austrian sub.</p>
