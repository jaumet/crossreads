 On Active Service Mrs Mum Dearheart I forgot to tell you in my letter just closed you can leave out the "21st rf" now & just address as above. The "I" in A.I.F. stands for "Imperial" not "Infantry" I hope you like the enclosed cards, I think they are just lovely expressions. Good night my very own wife, with kisses & squeezes & hugs (& pats on the ____) from your Husband
