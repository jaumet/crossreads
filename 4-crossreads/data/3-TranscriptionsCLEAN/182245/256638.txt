 Beautiful & sunny. Left Hazebruck 
 about 7 AM & came through 
 Baileull & Steenwerck to our 
 waggon lines near Steenwerck 
 They are good stables but rotten 
 billets. I took the gun up to 
 our new position halfway 
 between Fleurbaix & Chappelle 
 Armentieres. Its not a bad 
 posie but might be better.
