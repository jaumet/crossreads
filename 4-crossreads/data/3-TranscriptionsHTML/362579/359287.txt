<p>A great success.</p>
<p>If you feel inclined to send me any cakes, pack it in a tin   &amp;  address to Miss Conyers. We do not get many cakes now, but still have   <u>Sweets</u>  sent to us. Our boys (M. Officers) are awfully good to us   &amp;  everytime they go on busy to any little village try to bring us Chocolates or cakes. We really are a happy unit but a busy one.</p>
<p>Heaps of love and kisses. Tell my friends not to forget me.</p>
<p>From yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
