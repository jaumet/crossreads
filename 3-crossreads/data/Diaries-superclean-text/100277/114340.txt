a distance of 30 miles.
On the way up we ran through some fine towns including Amiens, the country round here is far more undulating than the other parts of France that I have seen.
The whole of our Divisional Transport was on the move they stretched for easily 5 miles we passed them on the way up.
We passed hundreds of German prisoners working on the roads railways, some of them were fine looking men but the majority were miserable looking speciemens who seemed only to pleased to be safe, I saw several of them driving traction oil engines
We reached our destination about 5 miles from Albert about 2 oclock just close to where we hopped out, we saw some enormous guns caterpillars, thousands upon thousands of big shells, they were every where, in the trucks, on the ground in fact
