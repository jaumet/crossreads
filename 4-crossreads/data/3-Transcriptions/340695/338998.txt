<p>7th to 18th  was spent at the Records office at Rouen where I spent a most enjoyable time. Visited the most important pleasure resorts Rom Seconis &amp; La Bouville. It is a beautiful city &amp; soldiers of all the Allied Nations are there in good numbers. It's theatres are good one or two very warm though. The Style! Gee whizz! The gentler sex are very chic. Quite a number of English girls dressed in Khaki work in the Tommy Offices &amp; they look very pretty shall never forget the trip to La Bouille it takes 2 hours by boat.<br/>Found the Train at the same spot Steenwerck.<br/>21-7-17. Jogging along as of old received a parcel from Dorie.</p>
