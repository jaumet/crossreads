  
 16 Thursday There was a rather heavy frost this morning & it was bitterly cold.  Was put on orderly room messenger all day, but it was very quiet.  There were about six German airoplanes over this morning one was brought down near Flers.  They dropped a few bombs, one killed a 13th Fld Amb fellow, a Tommy several Horses & wounded four men. There are a fair amount of Casualties go through here. 
 17 Friday We buried six poor beggars yesterday who had either been killed in action or died of wounds.  About 8 am A section went up to the East Flers dressing station, it is about 11/2  miles behind the line.  There are shells bursting all round us, Fritz is putting a good few over.  We are camped in dug outs here I saw the German airoplane that was brought down yesterday, also a ":tank" which got stuck in the mud here. 
 18 Saturday It snowed nearly all night & this morning.  Everywhere is all white with snow.  It rained nearly all day & was terribly cold.  We went down for water in the morning & took a patient down in the night, a trip I will never forget, we were up to our waist in mud nearly all the way, it was terrible.  We carry for about 800 yds then we wheel by a trolly for about a mile. 
 19 Sunday It is very bleak & cold.  We don't get very many  cases  wounded here, but a good few with trench feet.  We are about 300 yds east of the village of Flers.
