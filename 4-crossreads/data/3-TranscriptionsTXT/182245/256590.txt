 MARCH 1917 
 16 FRIDAY 
 Fine &amp; fairly warm. Cleaning 
 up round stables in morning 
 &amp; we took our guns out to a 
 new position in Ploegstreeet 
 in evening, the centre 
 section coming with us. 
 The &quot;posie&quot; is not nearly as 
 good as the old one, but 
 it might be a lot worse. 
 There&#39;s a great shell hole 
 through the wall, &amp; in the 
 ground all round, so its 
 been pretty lively there at 
 one time. Got back about 
 9 pm &amp; had tea &amp; then had 
 to turn out again &amp; draw 
 ammunition at the dump.
