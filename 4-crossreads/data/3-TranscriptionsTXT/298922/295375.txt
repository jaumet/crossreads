 Just written the wife &amp; now send this to you. I find with Laurie &amp; many friends in England my correspondence is heavy but I don't forget you little Mother, altho these notes are not very interesting now I try to keep a record going just to show you alls well each day. 
 Love to you all &ndash; it's a long time since I had a letter from KATHLEEN, I know I don't write but I like to hear, tell her please.
