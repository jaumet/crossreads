Sat July 20
Went to dance at Arcadia. There was a good crowd there and we had an enjoyable time. I only missed 3 dances.
Sun July 21
More Rain. The War news continues good, and Fritz is being kept "on the move".
The Yanks are "well in" it now and doing good work.
Finished Letter 31 to M.S.
Mon 22
Still raining. Lecture on "Electricity". Most interesting.
Attended Concert at Y.M. Miss Cooper's Party. Very Good.
Tues July 23 - PARCEL from Mother
The rain cleared away after dinner, and it was quite fine again. Got a Letter from Lill and 1 from Mrs Ibbs and a big, fat parcel from Mother, which was mighty welcome.
Managed to get my boots changed at the Q.M. Store, a thing I've been trying to do for weeks. Was warned to parade at Medical Hut at 2 oclock. Thought I was up for another Board, but it turned out to be nothing more than to sign my last Board Papers.
After Tea, Doug and I went to Mrs Lancaster's and spent a pleasant couple of hours. It was a glorious moonlight night and we strolled along the front till about 10.30.
Alright, Mrs A.J. I'm a flat, am I. Right O, I'll pay you back for that when I come Home.
