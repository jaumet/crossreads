 left at 11-am so I had to return at onc say Good Bye to my brother his chum . I expect that a Train would leav at about 3 Pm but there were none , so after say Good Bye I came back to the Station at 10-45 am , for some reason the Train did not start from the Station , but about 50 yard down the Line . I came to the conclus that the reason was that Fritz knew the rang of the station , he could easili shell the Train .
