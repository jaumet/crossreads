Turkish trenches were visible for miles to the rear and having brought up his reinforcements it was impossible to make way & from Aug. 21 to the evacuation the lines remained the same & our objective was never gained.  On the right too, we could see clearly the fight for Sari Bair mountains which were the key to the situation.  The N. Zealanders gained the summit but the Turks outnumbered there strength & they were forced to quit.  The artillery fire from our warships & land batteries was very severe & the Turks wereobliberated with the help of our machine guns.
