Tuesday 16 January 1917 [1918]Off 2-5 & went town 4 p.m. tea & S. Cambridge.Now letters are arriving, got 7 in 2 days, some written 11th Dec. '17, reached me 14th 1.'18.  Edith writes from Blue Mts.Spence thanks me for sox & says have been good sending them always.S. Cambridge is interesting - was a German prisoner for some months & worked under Miss Cavell before her execution.  She, Miss C., was shot 6 a.m. & Miss Cambridge had been visiting her in an unobtrusive way, for some time previously.  Miss Cavell had really saved hundreds of the boys & to see them begging in the streets for bread, was she says, a most pathetic sight.  We garry home through a glorious afternoon & hear this sad story of a good woman.
