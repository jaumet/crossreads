<p>Went out at 11 with Jensen and Rosewarne to dump.  Extremely dark and couldn't see 6" in front.  Fell off duckwalk several times and got considerably wet and muddy.  Rifle clogged this side of dump and and tin hat full of water.  Same job with party of 30 and on the dugouts.  Some fairly heavy artillery on right and later Fritz opened up a heavy reprisal bombardment but we didn't get much hate.  Stopped at quarter to four and back home in fair light.  Some rain.</p>
<p>5.3.18<br/>Had breakfast at 8 and slept on till 12 when we had lunch.  Then slept till 3 and cleaned up.  Stott going in as cook to horselines, Kinnear on leave.  Out again with Rosewarne, Strain &amp; King and did some more parapet and accomodations.  Starlight going out and I only slipped once.  Fairly quiet &amp; some rain during day.  One burst of machine gun bullets was had but most of us under cover.  Out at 11.30 and stopped at 3.30 and hurried home arriving at 4.15.  Rosewarne down hearted.  Am sleeping in Stott's bunk which is much more comfortable after argument with Sidman.</p>
