to themselves.
We have gone through tunnel after tunnel since we reached Italy. These parts seem to be nothing else but tunnels. One of the tunnels which we went through at a place called Roneo must have been at least eight miles long. After passing through these many tunnels we came on to more or less flat country with small hills on one side. The produce seemed to be of a mixed character, Vine, Olives, Almonds, Apples. Huge bullocks are used for tilling the soil. The people are very dark skinned. To go without boots seems to be the fashion amongst the working classes.
In England the children ask for pennies, in France for souvenirs, in Egypt for Buckshish, [Bucksheesh] and in Italy one cigarette. Cigarettes seem to be at a premium in this country judging by the joy that is expressed on receiving a cigarette.

Excitement as to which way we are going to travel, east coast, or west coast. If we travel west we have a chance of seeing some of the ancient cities, Rome etc.
The trains run very slow in Italy.
Very rich agricultural land
