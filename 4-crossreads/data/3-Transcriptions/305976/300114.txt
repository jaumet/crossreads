<p>final kit inspection &amp; I hope that this will be my last night in Egypt<br/>Saturday March 5<br/>The day has come at last. At 10pm we were marched out of Moascar by special train to Kantara. We were all in the best of spirits knowing that at last we were on our way. We arrived at Kantara about 12 noon &amp; Motor Lorries took our kits over to the other side of the canal. By 3pm we were all aboard the Troopship Port Sydney our future home for the next few weeks. About 4 pm</p>
