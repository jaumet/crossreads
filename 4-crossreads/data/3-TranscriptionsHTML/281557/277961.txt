<p>though muddy: it must take some organization to keep an advance going &amp; the work needed is hardly credable till one actually sees it: packed like sardines so slept warm: heavy bombardment on</p>
<p>Sundat Nov 5th  <br/>Montauban: cloudy showery bleak day: reveille 5am: breakfast 6 am: fell in in fighting kit &amp; moved off at 6.30 am to a reserve position: a heavy bombardment was on during the morning I believe we are in reserve for the 7th stunt: we had to run about to keep warm: the poor lads from the trenches are all mud: fair few planes about in spite of the wind: plenty of tractors &amp; other War gear about but I haven't struck a "tank" yet: the 7th got their objectives alright but were bombed back again: got home through the mud about 6 PM: rained heavy at night</p>
<p>Monday Nov 6th  <br/>Montauban: cold showery: up about 8am: issued with rations etc &amp; moved off about 1.30PM: had tea in a gully among the guns &amp; ploughed our way to the front line which we reached about 11 PM: the trenches are awful &amp; up to our knees in mud &amp; water: fairly quiet night</p>
<p>Tuesday Nov 7th  <br/>Trenches: showery day: this front line is in front &amp; a little to the right of Flers: there are a few villages in front &amp; also a stiff looking wood: we have to carry across the open here with a white flag &amp; Fritz does the same: the tracks are all knee deep in places &amp; we have to have six on a stretcher: there is a tank close by &amp; they are peculiar things alright</p>
