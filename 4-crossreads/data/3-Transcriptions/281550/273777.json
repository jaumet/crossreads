<p><u>May</u></p>
<p>to-night the Phosphorus has been very prevalent in the water. The last few night the southern cross was to be seen very low down on the horizon in a Southerly direction.</p>
<p>On Friday the 23rd we were well out in the Indian Ocean, The sea is very choppy and a lot of the men have been seasick, I am alright myself but there is a lot more men on board, that look as if it would be a great relief to them if they could only be sick.</p>
<p>We have kept land in sight from early morning until afternoon. The land was the North-east coast of Africa and it was on our Starboard side.</p>
<p>At about three Pm we passed a small island on our Port side.</p>
<p>Flying fish have been about in large numbers, we have passed through shoals of them. Porpoises also have been constantly ahead of the ship.</p>
