<p>This afternoon has been exceptionally quiet and there is no bombardment to night.</p>
<p>[Shorthand transcribed as follows]<br/>I wrote to Tom Douglas, Miss Annie McKinly and my sister Mrs. Sally Kittson tonight. [End of shorthand]<br/>Sunday Nov. 18. 1917.  1203.</p>
<p>Dull &amp; foggy.</p>
<p>There was a church parade this morning for those who could get away. Protestants 9.30, R.C. 10 A.M.</p>
<p>There was also an inspection of the harness &amp; horses by the A.S.C. and our vet Cpt. Davidson. One of our horses has the mange and the back stable were disinfected in consequence.</p>
<p>For months past we have had a plague of lice in our clothes. The bites itch very much &amp; we have to frequently change our clothes &amp; wash them, or they would crawl away. Now a kind of rash is breaking out on a lot of the men which is similar to scurvy. It is very itchy at night. The probable cause of it is a lack of sufficient vegetables, and clean clothes.</p>
<p>There is not much bombardment today, &amp; none this morning. What there is is up towards Ypres and Passchendaele.</p>
<p>Monday Nov. 19. 1917.  1204</p>
<p>Cold &amp; cloudy.</p>
<p>The front is very quiet this morning.</p>
<p>I have now 2 horses to look after, groom, water, &amp; feed. Also 1 saddle to keep clean.</p>
<p>I finished reading a book to night "The Four Feathers" a military tale by A.E.W. Mason.</p>
<p>I am on picquet to night</p>
