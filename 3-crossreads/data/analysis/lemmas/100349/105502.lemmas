 Work day and night on the alter . They say we will be readi to sail in the morn . 28/4/18 . We sail from Durban I the " Field Marshal " this morn . We were make good time until we ran into a heavi gale . The ship threw herself about in an extraordinari manner ; near everyon was sea sick . The lascar crew were down to it and I volunt with other chap to lash the lifeboat down they were break lose . A sea smash our forward cookhous , and we hove to for a while . Heavi sea 's are come aboard and the deck are wash with water . The ship is roll heavili , but as we have shift our cours to meet the gale it is not so bad now . Have never seen a big storm at sea befor and I am enjoy the sight of flung spray and foam .
