<p>where we were in close formation, &amp; it was marvellous that no one was hit. Had they dropped 5 minutes earlier, many of the boys must have been knocked, and one shell lobbed right on the spot where all the officers usually slept. Certainly a very narrow escape!</p>
<p>On leaving Albert we marched about 1 mile &amp; camped in a paddock for the night. It was pretty cold, and sleep was almost out of the question on account of the shells falling around.</p>
<p>Next morning 7/8/16 we went to Sausage Valley some 2 &frac12; or 3 miles from the firing line &amp; were put in reserves. Carved a little dug-out &amp; had two narrow escapes from pieces of shell. The valley is continually under heavy fire &amp; its wonderful that so few casualties occur. Our C Snr Charlie [indecipherable] and my Plat Sergt. (McDowell) got their coms. the day we arrived in "Sausage Gully.</p>
