<p>Tuesday 15 February, 1916</p>
<p>Wet day, the first for about a week. It was not enough to keep us off parade so we stripped the gun in the tent.</p>
<p>Dinner was painful today, no tea &amp; no water. Dry bread &amp; jam isn&#39;t a sumptuous repast whichever way you look at it, but its all in the game &amp; you&#39;re got to keep smiling.</p>
