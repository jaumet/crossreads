  
 1918 Sun 14th Apl The "local" waddled into Bebra in the early hours of the morning (about 3 am) & we saw the welcome sight of a couple of flat-footed frauleins waiting on the platform with coffee-pails & bread baskets - from which they fed our guard!   And we half famished! 
 However, after much chatter & bargaining the dear creatures finally brought us bread, coffee ersatz, & tiny packets of "Hackfleisch", a typical Hun delicacy consisting of raw chopped meat pounded into a slimy mass.  It was quite dark (our carriage lamp had gone out) so we ate the "Hackfleisch" with a clear conscience. 
 We left Bebra at 7 am - hooked on to another "local" leaving for Cassel.   Our postern grew quite garrulous at this stage, pointing out the prison of Napoleon III in 1871 & so forth.   Personally, I was quite ignorant of the fact that Nap. III was a gefangener in '71.   Passed a large prison-lager (apparently British) at "Ober-something near Cassel.
