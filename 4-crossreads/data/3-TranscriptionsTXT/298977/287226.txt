 Nothing to add now &ndash; I'm stuck &ndash; 
 Hope everything is going on O.K.  You should be able to get away for a spell now.  Get someone to take you on the Birtles trip on the Mitchell, but keep her in good order till I get back, when I shouldn't have any trouble in busting her up again. 
 Love to all at home. Your loving Son Roy.
