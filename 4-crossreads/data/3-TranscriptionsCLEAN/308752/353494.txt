  
 fairly well,  he told us that he was only 6 days a soldier, 3 days in the Firing Line & the other three in "no man's land" lying wounded until our regimental bearers picked him up.   He was greatly surprised that we were carrying him over country which was in Fritz's hands not two days ago. 
 6th October 17. Our squad consisting of Corporal Cosier, Joe Bonnel, Fred Wiggins & myself had to report to --  with 5 stretchers.  A guide came with us,  it was a long & dreary walk, full 2 1/2 miles before we eventually arrived at our destination which happened to  be about 600 yds from our front Line. The track was dreadful, all mud & shell holes. I do pity the regimental bearers, the fellows who pick the wounded men up in "no mans land" etc. & carry them to the Ambulance bearers. These men certainly deserve recognition. The country was every bit as bad as it was down the Somme last October 1916. scores of Germans were lying about,  I could have collected plenty of souvenirs but I am too disgusted with the whole business to bother about souvenirs now. Am just about fed up with it all. It was rather a trifle warm to be loitering about this vicinity so we soon made our way back,  it was absolutely a miserable day, pouring rain & a bitterly cold wind blowing. Oh, what a life. Arrived back at the post about mid-day. The journey took all the morning. No sign of any relief yet so we give up all of its arrival till tomorrow. Another miserable night but fortunately very few carries. 
 7th October 17. Relief actually arrived & it did not take me long to clear out. Arrived back at our Unit about mid-day & have a few days spell. 
 10th October 17. All the bearers receive word to be ready to move off at a minutes notice. At 1 p.m. we fall in ready for the fray again. Colonel Shepherd was present on the parade,  he made a long speech & bade us farewell as he is leaving the Unit. We were all very sorry to lose him,  he has treated us well.  We then board the lorries & conveyed to those big dugouts again & settle down for the night.
