 Dear Ida, 
 Just a note to let you know that I am well. We arrived here yesterday morning and have been coaling up ever since then. We leave for Colombo this afternoon I am pleased to say that I have got over the sea sickness. I am feeling and eating real well now and enjoying the voyage. This place is a very pretty one looking at from the harbour. None of us were allowed to go on shore so I cant say what the town is like . 
 The town is situated right between two small hills on the edge of the harbour and the harbour is enclosed by a succession of hills, the country looks pretty barren , looks like [indecipherable] country . So far we have had a  splendid voyage , the weather has been [indecipherable] and fine and calm. I daresay it will be a bit too[indecipherable] . I am going to try to get one of the coal lumpers to post this so that it will not be censored. I wrote a longer letter a couple of days ago I supposed it will be posted here, and you will get is with this one. Will have to stop now, Hoping you are all well, with love, your loving bro,  Gordon. Tell Clarry and Percy my address.
