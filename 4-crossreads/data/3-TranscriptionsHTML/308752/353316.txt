<p>Monday 8th February<br/>Received a letter &amp; two magazines from Mrs Wearing, Siam. Great activity &amp; excitement abounds our camp, thousands of troops from the Peninsula have arrived here. They all look well after their trying experiences. Same routine all the week, the discipline of the unit lately is excellent, numbers of troops camped near by have mentioned the fact.</p>
<p>Friday    February<br/>Route march to Bitter Lakes, a great fishing place, &amp; a very pretty spot too. The march was about 12 miles altogether, not bad going before dinner. To my great delight I met two of my pals from Mosman, they attended the old "Braemar Dances." Roy Pinnock</p>
