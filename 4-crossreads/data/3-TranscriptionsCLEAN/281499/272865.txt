  
 About 200 yards from us there are great watering troughs, & of an evening it is the sight of a lifetime to see the never ending strings of horses & mules going to & from the water they reckon there are 12,000 horses or mules in this valley & I believe it.  I pity the poor horses for they are bogged nearly half their time & they are covered with mud from head to foot, in this rotten rainy weather they look very miserable & they have to work very hard, toiling & struggling all the day long dragging shells, water, tucker & etc for the needs of the thousands of men who are engaged in this gigantic battle the guns never stop firing, & just at the rear of us there are some enormous guns & when they fire they fairly shake the hills.  Trains are running everywhere up here they are building the line as they advance.
