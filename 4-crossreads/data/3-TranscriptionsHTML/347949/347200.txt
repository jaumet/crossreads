<p>a Sunday if I remember rightly. The night was one of inky blackness -you just followed the man in front of you if you could see  him  or feel him -often you felt him rather to much  as you bumped into him often you heard him too. This march <br/>though moderately short  was one of the most hellish I did because chiefly owing to the  darkness &amp;  the distance we had to go nobody seemed quite  to know the way &amp; we would go on about 10 feet quite- a spurt then go on -stop again.<br/>We were all pretty tired and done up &amp; the constant stopping and bumping nearly drove one silly. We marched through corn fields and on all sorts of roads and<br/>the traffic !!!  Sometimes one had to stroll along in single file- sometimes tear<br/>along singly to get out of the road of the  wagons etc. There was a continuous<br/>never ending stream of guns of all kinds</p>
