  
 Wed 19th June A close friendship of years has been sagging in the middle and finally collapsed today when I told Bob Taylor "on behalf of the Mess" that we could no longer exist - as a mess.   His liver, poor old dear, is out of bounds - for a week he has not spoken to any of us & he snubbed me bluntly when I asked for an explanation this morning. 
 Over the pudding I broke the news, &, my part of the Dirty Work finished, I left George Pyne to divide up the Grub-box and the Plate. 
 Thu. 20th The new mess is most successful "Three Minds which think as one" as far as food is concerned.   "Why Hoard?" is our motto.   The chef of the day does his "shopping" the evening before.   From 5 to 8 pm Russians are perambulating the English barracks offering for barter potatoes, salads, eggs, even compasses & charts, & an occasional rabbit or chicken. 
 All stolen, of course, & smuggled into the lager in the trousers & shirts of the day-workers in the town.
