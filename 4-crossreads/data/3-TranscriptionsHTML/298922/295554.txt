<p>Saturday 1 Sept. 1917</p>
<p>Lost a leaf so put in an October one for today.</p>
<p>Such a Treat my mail arrived. JOE, DAY 8/7/17, MOTHER LAURA, WIFE &amp; sprig of "WATTLE" did I ever quote you some lines published in JO'BURG STAR S.A., "The scent of the WATTLE round LICHTENBURG Oh CHRIST my country again".</p>
<p>Sorry for JOE re enlisting but glad in many ways &ndash; "Angels can do no more" &amp; must read letters again.</p>
