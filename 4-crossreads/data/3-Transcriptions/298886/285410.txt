<p>I woke up and found we were still going along the rails and promptly went to sleep again. We got into Minia a good sized town a long way down the Nile. at 4 p.m where we all got out. When we were getting the horses out poor old "Pharoah" my good old horse had allowed the saddle to come round underneath the buckle of the surcingle and girth were right on the poor old boys back but he never moved he stood it all and he had been getting an awful time with the horse on either side pushing and shoving him about in the crowded horse box. I felt sorry for him but I soon rectified matters when I got him out. Another horse would have kicked the saddle and all the gear to pieces. But old "Pharoah" is one of the best. he can always be depended upon at all times. I think thats a good testimonial for him. We got into Camp and made fast for the night. Things rough and ready for the first night as is always the case. Slept alongside the saddle last night but I had my blankets and waterproof sheet so I did not do too bad.</p>
<p>This morning and during the day we have been pitching tents</p>
