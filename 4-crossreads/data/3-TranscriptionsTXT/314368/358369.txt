Dear Mother,I have not yet received any letters from home, I cant make out why, the authorities at headquarters must be deuced slow at dealing with the letters in the case of hospital patients, I am very pleased to say that my wound is getting on fine and I expect to be out in a convalescant home in a week or so now. I have been getting about on crutches for some time now, I cant put my foot to the ground yet, at least I can, but while I do so it will not heal. There is no pain at all in the ankle and it is only just a matter of waiting until the wound heals up. We have been having beautiful weather here ever since I came over nice cool sunny days, and everything is so green and the flowers
