P.S.Mother would you find out "Fat" Penfold's address & send it to me. There is no saying where we shall get to later on & if we go to England I would like to go and see him. Also any other people's addresses you know of. How about the Hendersons & Frasers?. Do you know their addresses? There is no need to give me Sir George Reids'. I am sure to be able to find him, & of course will go and have a yarn with him. Good-bye & I will write again soon. I daresay we will have landed long before you get this - I hope so anyhow.
Love to all,Alan.
