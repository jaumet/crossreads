Darling mum - don't you think you over estimate my scrawls - I never felt any of my letters  are  interesting - rather sordid - and I am often so stupidly tired I cant find the right word - or spell, well I suppose that doesn't matter much - for rested - I spell I know rather badly. Of course since I came to Cairo - I have been greedy for bread & butter - and fortunately what we get in our mess is good. Madame Lewis our [indecipherable] is a french woman and must know a good baker. I feel as if I never want to eat a biscuit or tinned fish or fruit ever again. But who knows, in a few weeks it may be our fare again - and be glad to get it. I am glad you have the flat to yourselves again and that you will have some privacy for a bit. I do not say any thing about Edith because she has endured so much and been such a brick - that I cant judge for her. I want her to do anything she can to help yours & Fathers & Mrs Rich's wonderful effort to restore Bills manhood
