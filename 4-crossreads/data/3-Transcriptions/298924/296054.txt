I leave her luggage with me or most of it.<br/>Weather Hot &amp; boat crowded altho' we have 6 Red X nurses on board, my wife was not allowed to come.  The 2 Regts. 1st &amp; 2nd are on Board with Gen. Cox as O.C. Transport.  52 Officers &amp; 1032 or. ranks on a boat built to carry about 400 passengers.
