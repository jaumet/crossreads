 Tuesday  24/4/17 
 Nice sunny day, but cold wind blowing. Captain Young is in charge of C. Section. Heavy drill all day &ndash; mostly doubling on the hard roads &ndash; which has made our feet very sore &ndash; after being so used to the mud and water. Good news coming in from all parts of the line. 
 Wednesday  25/4/17 
 Cloudy but fine &ndash; Very cold at night. Our section on fatigue in transport lines, all fatigues ceased at 11 am, &amp; we had the rest of the day to ourselves &ndash; many played foot ball etc. I immediately struck out across country to Pozierres to try &amp; find Percy Singles grave. Made a careful search all around Pozierres &ndash; Moqouet Farm &amp; the Windmill. I was not successful in finding his grave unfortunately. Pozierres in my opinion is beyond recognition, not even the usual heaps of bricks, etc. Two very fine wooden Crosses about 15 feet high are being erected one to 1st Division A.I.F. &amp; the other 20th Battallion. Got home about 6/30 pm very tired.
