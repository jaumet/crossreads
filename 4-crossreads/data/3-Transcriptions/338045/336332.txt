<p>1916<br/>night &amp; again to-day.  Cold winds.  No parade at 6-30 a.m.  Walking about in mud &amp; rain very unpleasant.  At 2 p.m. I take a party to the Quartermaster of about 50 men for equipment &amp; this takes up all afternoon.  Rain clears off at night &amp; turns freezingly cold.  After a brisk walk to canteen, bed at 8-30 p.m.  Expenses 1fr.  Very little news from the front.</p>
