 March 1918 Tuesday 5 
 Messines Had an S.O.S. call at 2.7 am. Fritz put his barrage down for a fairly long stretch of time. Had the 4-6 and left for F.O.P. at 6.30 with Mr Kerr. Weather dull, with icy winds from W.S.W. Spent a chilly morning. Mr May the news officer from D.A.C.arrived out at O.P. with Charlie. Kerr although looking very seedy, registered the Lens lines Code F.M. and Square FM for the Officers benefit. Let the carrier pigeons go at 5 to 4.
