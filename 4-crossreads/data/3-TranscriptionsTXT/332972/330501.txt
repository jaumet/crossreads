 [Newspaper clipping with handwritten date &ndash; 8/5 19] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sun, Wednes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kaiser Will Return" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Von Luckner's Opinion &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; War Prisoners From N. Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Auckland, Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A detachment of 168 prisoners of war has been despatched from Wellington for transport by the Willochra, which will sail to-day to embark prisoners from Australia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Auckland party comprises 87 Germans, many of whom were interned since the occupation of Samoa, 80 Jugo-Slavs, and one Austrian, all of whom desire repatriation, and includes Comander von Luckner and his lieutenant, Kircejles, of the raider See Adler, and other members of the former Samoan Administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest excitement prevailed amongst the Germans in camp before the departure, and the highest spirits were displayed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Von Luckner, wearing a new uniform with four ribbons, was loudly farewelled by his friends in his own tongue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at Auckland to an officer, von Luckner said that the Kaiser would return to the throne. He made no remark about the German Navy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forty Germans remain in the internment camp. The former German and Austrian Consuls have been released on parole on the ground of ill-health. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-groomed and Well Fed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wellington (N. Z. ), Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When 168 internees, including 13 women and children, and 80 Jugo-Slavs, left Auckland internment camp to entrain for the Willochra, all appeared in the highest spirits. Count von Luckner, in naval uniform, was as excited as a schoolboy, and boasted that the Kaiser would return to the throne. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All looked well fed and well groomed, and many wore new clothes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The departure was kept secret, but small boys counted the party out as it marched through the streets. The boys also sang "Good-bye. " &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Schultz, Von Luckner, and other officers and the women and children were accommodated in motor cars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party will be joined by about 150 internees from Featherston internment camp to-day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expected that the Willochra will leave via Australia to-morrow. [Newspaper clipping with handwritten date &ndash; 7/5] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German Internees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfounded Allegations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treatment In Concentration Camps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been handed a statement by Senator Gardiner, Messrs. Brookfield, M. L. A. and E. E. Judd, alleging ill-treatment by the military authorities whilst incarcerated at the Holdsworthy Internees' Camp and at Longwarrin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have made inquiries the treatment of inmates at the Holdsworthy camp, and it is learnt from a reliable source that the allegations are without foundation. The internees have little to complain of in the treatment meted out to them. It is pointed out that some very bad characters are locked up among the Germans in our camps, but that generally the fullest efforts have been made to do justice to all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of the allegations in the statement are in reference to the Langwarrin camp, which is in Victoria, and are supposed to have occurred as far back as 1914 and 1915.
