5/11/17 Bologne Parma
of British Tommies there. Later we passed French troop trains. The country in Tuscany is well cultivated and the vine is trained into growing trees. Haystacks often have a live tree for their central support. Parma has a number of perfumery factories. The Italian passengers were all of a good class and seem unreserved. The whole compartment soon becomes engaged in full conversation and the gesticulation is so excessive as to be amusing. The habit of spitting so common among the men is rather disgusting and they are by no means pretty eaters. The train commenced running late and was overcrowded. The War traffic becomes thick on the lines as was evidenced by the number of trains passed and the nature of their freight. Reached the crowded station of Milan at about 5 pm.
