<p>&amp; we ring in some pretty tall yarns</p>
<p>All the Irish patients are being transferred to Iceland today wouldn't mind if I were going.</p>
<p>Was out snapshotting this afternoon down Hagley Road way, &amp; standing on the corner at the terminus I saw a small party of W.A.A.C.'s standing so for a lark I went across &amp; said to them, have you any objection to my taking a snap of your little party.  of course they giggled &amp; said they would only be too pleased &amp; etc. so I took them 8 in all, after this we started talking and it appears they were going out for a picnic &amp; they had all their cakes &amp; things with them in a couple of boxes, &amp; they invited my mate &amp; I to join them, after a bit of word sparring we consented and away we went up in to the woods</p>
