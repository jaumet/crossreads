<p>21 WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>Fine, but cold &amp; dull till</p>
<p>the evening when it cleared</p>
<p>up. Went for a bath in the</p>
<p>morning &amp; as they did not</p>
<p>open till 10 AM we were</p>
<p>not back for stables. Out</p>
<p>exercising all the afternoon</p>
<p>Campbell went up to the</p>
<p>battery &amp; Wall came down</p>
<p>to take charge of the waggon</p>
<p>lines. Sent a post card</p>
<p>to Linda of Armenti&egrave;res, &amp;</p>
<p>half past eleven square</p>
<p>before the war.</p>
