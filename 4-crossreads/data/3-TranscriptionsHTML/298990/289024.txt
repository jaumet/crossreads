<p>23/9/16  Belgium looks very well this morning for, after a cold night, a warm sun is shining and entices one to bask in it.  Early there was a good artillery rally in front of us and the guns seemed to keep up a rumble all the morning.  During the night some Zepps sailed across going West and our searchlights and aeroplanes were active.  The women remaining here are by now thoroughly coarsened by soldiers and freely indulge in filthy epithets in their conversations with men.  There is no open vice though and possibly despite their careless speech, their morals remain good.  Stayed in Brigade camp all day and after lunch went to sleep until awakened by Padre Devenford whom it was a pleasure to see again.  He poured out all his troubles and received some good advice in return for he is a fine little chap.  All day one of our 'planes has been in the air but the line appears to have been quiet. The roads here in wet weather will be just about impassable for vehicles.  The country is so low lying that the occasional sluggish canals surely cannot drain the land.  Davis and Elmiger walked in at mess in the evening and we had a good pitch in the evening.</p>
<p>24/9/16  Slept in late and after breakfast set out to find our transport lines to arrange for a horse up to the trenches tonight.  Walked over open fields and cultivated places &ndash; all clayey and promising of plenty mud in due course.  Bare top poles standing up and bunches of beans or some other plant seem to be drying outside each house.  Found Mills and some of the other old heads and then went over to the transport lines for a cup of tea.  An old French interpreter was there packing up and was a great character.  Stayed yarning until 12 and then went round the roads in a 1st Divn motor car reaching BHQ  for lunch.  Slept all the afternoon and had an early tea and rode through Ypres to Battalion Headquarters.  The road is a  good cobbled one and passes through many a hamlet quite wiped off the earth by shells.</p>
