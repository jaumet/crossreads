 Fine &amp; warm, but cooled down &amp; 
 came up windy at night. We dropped 
 anchor in the bay about 12.15 AM 
 The boats took the troops off 
 during the morning &amp; we 
 left again at 3.30 pm for Melbourne 
 They did not even take off the 
 cargo they had. The troops 
 went into quarintine. 
 I got a wire from mother.
