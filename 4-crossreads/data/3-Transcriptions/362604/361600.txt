<p>straight to Mr. Edmonds Home again.  I showed [showered] etc., ironed out my Peirrot suit &amp; got ready.  After tea we all made down to the Hall.  There were about 5 in uniform &amp; all the rest were in fancy dress.  It was a good affair.  I played all the Dance music &amp; for all the games.  I played the first waltz too slow &ndash; a forgiveable error, 'cos a fast opening waltz on a slow floor is too awful - &amp; the first two-step too fast but that is nothing 'cos I've not played for about 3 years or so.  We had a lovely supper equal to any pre-war turn out.  I did not indulge because I am not used to such dainties &amp; would be ill as sure as it rains.  I arrived Home after a delightful evening at 1.30 a.m. &amp; went straight to bed.  I was up at 7 a.m. next morning &amp; caught the 8.50 train back to Bulford.  I am only just now getting over the wear &amp; tear of those few days &amp; nights.</p>
<p>Well, Mum, I am Orderly Corporal to-day &amp; I want to write to Dad &amp; Geo &amp; also about 10</p>
