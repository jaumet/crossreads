  
 two perfectly sweet little girls, one about as old as Bill & the other about two years old. They are the dearest little kids imaginable and are allowed to come into the drawing room and all. I was there for an hour yesterday for afternoon tea & the old dame is perfectly sweet. She shakes hands with her two hands & is most genuinely glad to see soldiers. 
 There is a great beach here and Im going down presently as its Sat. afternoon & all the population goes there. The ladies have good complexions here and I haven't seen a dark one yet they are all blue eyes & fair, so you see I'm quite safe, for they are sure to like dark boys. The Zulus are the most magnificent specimens of men I have ever seen, & those who pull the rickshaws adorn themselves & paint up wonderfully. The city is not a large one but it has one fine street, West Street. 
 I was not sick at all coming over & we had one big storm too. I think the Karola broke me in. Well Mother dear give my love to all & hoping grandma pulled through that awful pneumonia. 
 Your loving son
