  
 I am on second picquet tonight from 11.30 to 2.am 
 Monday Aug 5. 1918. 1462. Last night was very dark but the time soon passed as there was a lot to do. All the teams were late. They were held up on the road for 2 hours in order to let a Battalion of tanks pass. Unfortunately one of the drivers will not come back. George McLeod was killed last night by a shell & one of the mules wounded & also L/C A, Borthwick slightly wounded. They were taking rations to one of the companies. One of the cooker drivers at H.Q. is reported to be wounded, but it is not confirmed. When we leave here which is daily & nightly expected we are to go to Corbie which is a very hot shop. I saw  L/C Borthwick this morning. He is shook up a bit. He was walking ahead of the limber when the shell lobed & George when hit fell off & the mules bolted. Borthwick carried him off the road but he died almost immediately & said only Archie. Jim Anderson who was walking behind the limber was severely wounded & taken to hospital. This afternoon is wet & muddy.
