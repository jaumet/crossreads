<p>the soil here is chalk.&nbsp; Opposite crowning the slope are a few</p>
<p>ragged stumps, fragments of tree trunks some 10 feet high, with</p>
<p>bits of splintered lower branches sticking from them and this</p>
<p>marks where Ovillers used to be.&nbsp; You would not know it but for</p>
<p>the tree fragments but when you look you see that there is a quantity</p>
<p>of broken brick and stone mixed up with the kneaded earth, and also</p>
<p>you come to a hole in the ground which being square and lined with</p>
<p>brick is obviously not a shell hole, but must be a cellar which once</p>
<p>had a house above it.&nbsp; No village could be more destroyed because</p>
<p>there is nothing left but a few half filled up cellars:&nbsp; of buildings</p>
<p>there are none.&nbsp; Underground it is different.&nbsp; Here again the</p>
<p>enemy had constructed elaborate dugouts to aid him in the defense of</p>
<p>the village for he well knew the importance of making a strongpoint</p>
<p>of a village, as possibly no type of fighting yields the number of</p>
<p>casualties to an attacking force as does village or street fighting</p>
<p>where every nook and cranny seems to shelter a machine gun.&nbsp; It was</p>
<p>estimated that the dugouts in this village could hold, and did hold,</p>
<p>2.000 Germans.&nbsp; It is doubtless true and one fears from the smell</p>
<p>that they hold many yet.&nbsp; We went down into several though the</p>
<p>entrances to most are battered in by shells, and groped about</p>
<p>among the litter and darkness.&nbsp; One great dugout here was found to</p>
<p>contain no less than 80 dead Germans which gave rise to the opinion</p>
<p>that during the desperate fighting it was used as a sort of vault</p>
<p>into which the dead were thrown with the intention sometime of</p>
<p>wrecking the entrance and thus making a tomb for all time.&nbsp; The</p>
<p>enemy&#39;s departure though was more durried than they expected and</p>
<p>the job was left for us to finish.&nbsp; Another large dugout there is</p>
<p>which the Germans used as a dressing station.&nbsp; It is admirably</p>
<p>constructed and has besides the main entrance from a trench, another</p>
