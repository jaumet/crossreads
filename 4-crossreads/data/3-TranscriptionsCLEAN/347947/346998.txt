  
 the snow falling heavy and bitter cold so after dinner left Edinburgh at 2.20.  it was Tues 8th Feb 1916 and after nine hours on the train arrived at King cross London at 11.20 same night it was a very cold journey but interesting for past some large towns and bridges.  one was called the forth bridge a marvellous one too fully 1 1/2 miles long across a river.  there were a few pathetic scenes too, for at several stations scottish soldiers were leaving by this train on there way to the front or too camp in London.  so we witnessed their parting at several stations which all served to pass the time away during the journey
