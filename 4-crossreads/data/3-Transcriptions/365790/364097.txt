<p>VII    The Advance along the Somme - Bellicourt<br/>On the battle that took place on Aug 8th the battalions main task was to make good the main road leading due east thro' Villers Brettoneux &amp; Warfusee &ndash; this road was to be passable for armoured cars within 4 hours after zero  &amp; to be fit for general traffic as soon as possible afterwards.  Other tracks had also to be cleared for which 'A' Coy were responsible &ndash; the main road being allotted to 'C' &amp; 'D' Coys - 'B' Coy being in reserve.  As much as possible was done in the way of repair prior to the battle; the road generally however was in better condition than expected &ndash; only two really bad patches were encountered &amp; a large amount of debris in the village of Warfusee.<br/>A number of contact mines were discovered which the engineers removed.  By 7.40 am (3 hours &amp; 20 mins after zero) the first armoured car entered Warfusee &amp; by 10 am the traffic along the road was in full swing.  Throughout the day no traffic was held up thro' road troubles.  'A' Coys road to Marcelcave was also completed &amp; was largely availed of.  For the next few days road maintenance was the chief consideration.  A field dressing station was built by 'B' Coy near Bayonvillers on Aug 11th &amp; on the 12th the battalion commenced repairing the main railway line &amp; carried out 1&frac12; miles of this in conjunction with the 1st Canadian Railway Coy.<br/>A few days later <strike>the battalion</strike> a move was made to near Morcourt, the battalion camping in a large hillside. <strike>This lasted</strike> After a few days work on communication trenches &amp; road maintenance another move to Vaux sur Somme was ordered. This involved about a 10 mile march along a very dusty road on a somewhat trying day.  At Vaux sur Somme the battalion enjoyed a 4 days rest which was most welcome.  The battalion then moved back to Morcourt where road maintenance &amp; deep dugout construction occupied its attention.  However on Aug 29th the enemy retired to the head of the Somme by Peronne so a rapid move forward</p>
