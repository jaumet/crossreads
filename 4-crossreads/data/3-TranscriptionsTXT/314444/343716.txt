Dear Mother & Father,A few lines to let you know I am doing well & feeling first class. I had a letter from Nurse Weaver & will call & see her as soon as I can get down to London.We are still having plenty of rain. You know those Hughes, who live round Kurraba Rd, well he has just arrived here & was round to see me. I believe Walker Mason is only a few miles from here & will be coming along to see me tonight. In case the photo I posted you went astray I am posting you another.I am pretty busy so will closeHoping you are all well best wishes & loveYour loving SonTom
