9.6.15tomorrow, sapping in rather hard work, so I went to Sergeant Nelson & arranged that we are to go on despatch carrying, & then pratted my frame up to Adams & told him we could not go sapping as we had to do despatch carrying;  so we shall probably get tomorrow off doing nothing but I do not know how long it will last.  Cool drinks etc. can be bought on the beach, there is also a supply ship a little distance from the shore, but I believe they have sold out of writing paper, envelopes & ink;  so we are as bad off as ever.
