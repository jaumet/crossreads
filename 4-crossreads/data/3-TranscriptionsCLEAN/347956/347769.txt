At 9.30 she had sighted the enemy travelling at full speed, she was able to get within range in twenty minutes, at the same time she signalled the chase was steering north.  At 10.45 A.M. the latter had to beach herself to avoid sinking.  her foremast & three funnels were down, but the flag was still flying.Sydney then went after Emden's collier took the crew off & sunk her, Sydney returned again to "Emden" she surrendered.  the extent & nature of the German casualties are not yet known, but they are bound to be severe.  The "Sydney's" own casualties required hospital treatment which was probably found on Direction Island.  The Emden had had time to destroy wireless
