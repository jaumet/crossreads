<p>St Annes-on-Sea.<br/> Much better, but raining.<br/>Quite a lot of wounded men are here.<br/>Breakfast in bed &amp; every luxury.  Mr Ish senior goes to Manchester every day so Dolly &amp; I have the day to ourselves.  "Pa" offers to rent a Farm &amp; me pay nominal interest in <u>England</u>- but I must go Home &amp; show you "Dolly" &amp; see how she stands Station life first- I would hate to leave you in Australia.<br/>Bronchitis much better.</p>
