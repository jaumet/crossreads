are rumours now of our Brigade stopping back here as Garrison. Everyone feels very disappointed over it. Personally I cannot express my chagrin. I want to see more of Palestine, Damascus, Nazareth, the Sea of Gallillee, dozens of places full of deep interest, and if report is true, we will not have an opportunity.

I do not think the end is yet. As President
