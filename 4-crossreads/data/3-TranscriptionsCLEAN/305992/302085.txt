It appears that several troop ships are loading troops for Beeroot the seaport recently captured in Palastine. 8.30 am arrived at Port Said where we shall take in coal & water for another long journey. The officers of the Kanowra came on board. She is bound to some Greek islands with the intention of bringing back  Turkish  British prisnors in exchange of Turkish prisnors. The Katoomba is also here from New York. She is full of Turkish prisnors going to take same to  Syria in exchange for British prisnors  Salonika for labor work. The Ormond H.M.T. left today full of Turkish prisnors for Salonika. All shore leave stopped from our troopship & no one but the naval & military authorities allowed on board. Having so many thousands of Turkish prisnors in Egypt, the authorities cannot very well cope with them.
