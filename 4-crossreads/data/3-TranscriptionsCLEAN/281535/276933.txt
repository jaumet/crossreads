  
 26/4/19 Cologne Up betimes and caught 7.30 train for Mainz. Though dull the journey was a most beautiful one. The lovely fruit blossom is covering the country just now. Reached Mainz 12 & Wiesbaden 1pm. Had some lunch and then did a promenade round the streets buying a few things  before coming back to the hotel and having a few hours sleep as I was tired. Then got up and went to Opera and saw a rather good operette called "Die Gfwadasfurten" but could not understand the dialogue. Met a French officer in the same loge Lieut. Boisgelin of the 86th Artilliere as charming a chap as one could wish to meet and fluent English speaker - a nephew of Lord Lucan. Went and had dinner with him at the Palast Hotel Cercle and yarned afterwards.
