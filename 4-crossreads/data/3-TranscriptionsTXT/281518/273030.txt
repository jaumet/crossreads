 London 3rd L.G Hospital Quite a lot of Australian officers in this (K) ward. From all accounts the 5th Divn. Show at Armentieres was a hopeless bungle. Hunhter called in during afternoon and as there is no sign of kit, gave him some money for some necessaries. He says Fussell went mad and is now in restraint. Got up later in afternoon and hobbled round the wards in a dressing gown. Saw Bird whose right leg is off at the waist, - poor devil. It is a great thing being able to do for oneself and be independent of the orderlies. 
 5/8/16 Much better. Bunning wounded and called in. had a hot bath and complete clean change 
 6/8/16 Hot &amp; close. Can move round the wards a bit and feel bored to extinction. Base kit not in store and it will be a long time before the other arrives from the Battalion so intend to purchase a new outfit. Being Sunday there were numbers of visitors about and one must admit that the English girls, with their milk-and roses-complexions, are very nice. Hobbled all around the grounds. 
 7/8/16 Dull wind &amp; cold but later it cleared up. Ordered uniform etc. 
 8/8/16 Fine day. Progressing very well and am only waiting for clothes to start moving around.
