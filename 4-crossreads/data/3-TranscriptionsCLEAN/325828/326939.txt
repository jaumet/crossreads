Well all went well & we were going along when Wal turned round & gave me his cigarette saying "Here Le, finish this one for me:  I've only had about 2 or 3 draws at it, & now I'm going to "puke." Talk about laugh. Rid & I nearly choked laughing at poor old Wal. Must close now, Daddy dear Trusting you are all keeping well at "Cairnleath" With much love to you & Mother dear, not forgetting Ol & Anna, Your loving son, Leo.
