Fooled round in mud all day getting fixed. two biscuits all day &ndash; the mob's half starved &amp; savage. Seymour was a king to this. 30th Fixed up at last. Complimented by commandant  for good behaviour coming in. Tucker supply arriving slowly &ndash; margarine bread, a little jam, tea, &amp; bully. Nothing hot so far, but promised. No work until hunger appeased. The trouble all arises from the mix up caused by the wreck, &amp; subsequent splitting up of P Lincoln units among other ships.
