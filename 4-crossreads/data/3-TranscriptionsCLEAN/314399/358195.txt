 Friday 18 July 1919 Auntie gave me a Sov. for a watch chain. Used 10/- towards my fare. Trains were all late. Had dinner on the train. Got into London at 9.15 & then came down to Jermyn Court Hotel & got a bonny room. Went for a walk down Haymarket thro Admiralty Arch to Buckingham Square then to Westminster & along Whitehall & Haymarket & back to the Hotel. A tremendous crowd already. Cars galore could hardly move the whole place is marvellously decorated. Looks bonny. Got a letter from Janet at the hotel.
