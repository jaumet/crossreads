 20/6/19 London as we had a steadi drive rain and low black cloud which made the throng street look like pitch . Back to Piccadilli and round Chare Cross do some shop . After dinner went in to town again and first of all to Covent Garden and then to Druri Lane . Saw Robert Lorrain as "Cyrano de Bergerac " a one-man show rather touch . The rain had kept a lot of peopl away and you could not call the hous good by ani mean . Lorrain has a peculiar way of bow when he take the curtain . There were few peopl round Piccadilli and the Strand owe to the rain . There is someth charm about the quiet old church one run up against sandwich among the modern build . A good view from the Thame enbank of London under raini sky .
