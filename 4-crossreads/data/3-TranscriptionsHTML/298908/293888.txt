<p>Was up very early this morning getting my duties off for I am Orderly Sgt. &amp; don't finish till 10 oclock this morning.</p>
<p>1st December.  Well if ever I came a thud in my life it was last night &amp; I have not finished laughing about it yet, nor am I likely to forget the incident in a hurry even though it brings discredit on myself in one way of looking at the affair, it happened this way &ndash; Last week I was running short of money &amp; I cannot stand the idea of being out with a girl &amp; having nothing in your pocket.  I could easily have got some by wiring Mr. Duke but I was not going to do this so I told the Nissens I was going on leave for a few days.  At the time I fully intended going but the night my pass came out all leave was unfortunately cancelled &amp; I had to stop in Camp, now I thought I'll keep away for a week &amp; tell them that I have been on leave &amp; so save a &pound;1 or 2.  I went down to town a few nights but I kept my eyes open half fearing to see Ethel, but all went well</p>
