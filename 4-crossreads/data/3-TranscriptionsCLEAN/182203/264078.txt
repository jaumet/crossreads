  
 from the one I took with Nickie last Monday - It was a fine trip, reached The Palace about 3. p.m. had time to do the Galleries & the Grounds - some of the girls had not been there before - caught the 4.30. p.m. boat for Richmond. Oh, the River Thames is beautiful & we thoroughly enjoyed every inch of the way. Also highly amused - boats of all kinds, but really have not time to describe them - Folk having afternoon tea on the river, boats moored along the banks, tucked in under trees, looking very gay, girls & boys in gay clothing - spirit lamp on table with kettle boiling. My, the lovers here  are most brazen - no modesty at all - worse than the Australians in Egypt. The House-boats on the Thames are a sight to see - must try to get a picture of it & send you. Reached Richmond at 6.15. p.m.
