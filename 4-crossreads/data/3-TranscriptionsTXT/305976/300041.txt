to Jerusalem rest camp for a weeks spell. This rest camp is run by the Division for the troops in Jericho. It has been found that many of the boy's if they can get a week's spell, it often saves what may be a serious illness in Hospital.We caught the Motor Lorry at Jericho & were taken to the rest camp situated about one mile from Jerusalem in a building which was at one time a Convent. We arrived here about 5 pm & found it very cool after the valley. The difference in climate is easily understood when the Jericho flat is 1200
