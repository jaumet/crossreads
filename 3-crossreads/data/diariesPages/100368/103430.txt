swimming about in water, the various kinds of fish which are to be found in the River Nile.

July 22nd
O’N and myself went into town on an A.S.C. Waggon and got off at the Cairo Station.
Making our way down a narrow street in order as O’N said to ‘lose ourselves’ for the afternoon we wandered on "all dressed up and nowhere to go".
We walked slowly along accosting as we went, native sellers, speaking to them in broken Arabic and by this means added more to our few Arabic words.
As we wandered about we got an insight into the work-a-day life of the natives. 
We saw them making the cage-like beds made from the branches of the Palm Tree, the same as the ones which we at present sleep on.
We saw an old man turning wood by a very clever device in the form of a hand lathe. It was turned by means of a bow, the string of the bow being put round the article to be turned. The rapidity by which this old man turned these articles with this ancient device was marvellous.
As we passed a large window we saw a large number of natives with watches in front of them. Thinking this place to be a watchmakers shop we went in to see the time. We were greeted with a roar of laughter by about thirty men and boys seated at tables like the desks in a school.

Much to our surprise and amusement
