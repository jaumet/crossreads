 2/4/18 ? Mont Roug The road was fring with hedg that were just begin to show a ting of green and on the tree were green tint . A climb brought us up to Mont Roug from the top of which is an excel view in all direct for mile . From here you can see more than from Kemmel or Cassel , I think becaus the countri behind is also visibl . The smoke of train factori in enemi territori could be plain observ . We seem to circl round Bailleul now desert and ruin . The tower of the old Hotel de Vill has been knock off and later on we saw the flame of burn hous , Poperingh one way and Steenwerk
