I just loved them & you are a dear to write so often & so much.  Its no good trying to say how much they are appreciated.  I see they have had rain & floods in Riverina, so I hope Tog is all right now.  Congratulate Peg for me, will you, my very best wishes.
You engineered things beeyutifully.  I'm glad the garden is so good, old Biggs isn't bad.  Rumors are very persistent about our being home by Christmas & we are all hoping it will come true but ---
Now I must flee.  Love to the Boss & Graham (how the lad is growing) & dear old Mac & Mrs. Kathryn & Tom Ellis also the boys & all the men.  I'm glad you've forgiven Tommy & hope things are all right with you & the family by now.  You know (you musn't mind my saying it) all you Bettingtons are a bit hasty & hot headed & touchy but these little differences are only on the surface & you love one another & stick together O.K. underneath.  I'd just love to see you if anyone came up to you & started to run Miss Hilda down real badly.  Talk about fur & feathers.  Hooray my dear, much love & tons of thanks & gratitude.
FromAlways yours as everJames
