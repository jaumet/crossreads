<p>11 April, 1916<br/>Salhia<br/>Have had a bosker day, I was woke up at a quarter to six to go on fatigue &amp; felt like going crook as its no joke to have to lump barley &amp; corn on an empty stomach, however it was a soft job the rest of the day &amp; I got time to have a good bath .  I have heard that they have blocked us from using the water from the tanks for washing so I don't know how we are going to get on now.  I think they must be mad.  I received a good mail yesterday &amp; was glad to get the letters.</p>
