<p>I looked in at the Bank of New Zealand &amp; asked for Charlie Thomas  -  He was manager here some 7 years back  -  He is in Dunedin now  -  On my return to the ship I examined a stone obelisk &ndash; erected to commemorate &ndash; the taking over of Fiji  -  Some ship's arrival &amp; the earliest land sales on that particular spot  -  1837 I think was the earliest date but even now it's getting obliterated by the action of sun &amp; rain  =</p>
<p>Wednesday Oct 21 - A quiet morning  -  The only diversification was the case of an AB who got 28 days in Suva gaol for abusive language &amp; threatening demeanour  -  The ship's crew was paraded &amp; the judgment &amp; sentence read out before everyone &amp; off he went with an armed guard to the seclusion of a gaol with native Fijian warders to look after him  -  I had to certify to his health which was excellent  -  Navy  -  discipline is also excellent  -  A man gets cautioned &amp; every chance to amend his way but if he don't he gets dished &amp; to some sound  time too  -</p>
