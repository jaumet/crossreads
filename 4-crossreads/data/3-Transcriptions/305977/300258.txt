<p>September 1915<br/>at night.  Did second shift.  About 8 pm there was heavy rifle &amp; machine gun fire mostly to   the left.  I dont know if any attack was on.</p>
<p>Wednesday Sept 1st<br/>A cool cloudy day.  There was a lively artillery duel in the morning.  2 chaps in our troop Snowden &amp; Watts got wounded with shrapnell.  Watts only slightly.  We had fried steak for dinner today the first fresh meat for some time.  Gee was wounded in the afternoon.  Had his arm torn about badly.</p>
<p>Thursday 2nd<br/>We had a quiet day.  The 6th sent their first lot of men up to Lone Pine for 48 hours.  It is a fairly warm corner &amp; takes some holding.  The 2nd LH Brigade have been holding it for over 3 weeks now together with the 4th LH who are attached to the 2nd Brigade</p>
