 The Better Land 
 1.  I hear thee speak of a better land Thou call'st its children a happy band Mother where is that radiant shore? (Shall we not seek it) &amp; weep no more Is it where the flower of the orange blows And the fireflies dance through the myrtle boughs Not there: not there: my child. 
 2.  Is it far away in some region old Where rivers wander o'er sands of gold Where the burning rays of the ruby shine And (the diamond lights up) the secret mine Is it there sweet mother that better land Not there: not there: my child 
 3.  Eye hath not seen it, my gentle boy Ear hath not heard its deep songs of joy Dreams cannot picture a world so fair (Sorrow or death) may not enter there Time doth not breathe (on its fadeless bloom) Far (beyond the clouds) (Far beyond the tomb) Far beyond the clouods &ndash; beyond the tomb It is there, It is there My child it is there Tis there
