 Now I must say goodbye to my little diary, the recorder of my pleasures &amp; hardships &amp; the times of peace &amp; war through which it has been my lot to pass since leaving my civilian life for the sterner one of a soldier. 
 I am sending it on a long journey which I hope to make myself ere long but if perchance I am long in coming this little book will tell in brief what my fortunes have been in these distant lands to which the call of the Flag has led me. 
 God grant us a speedy victory &amp; a safe return with honour. 
 L.K. Stuart
