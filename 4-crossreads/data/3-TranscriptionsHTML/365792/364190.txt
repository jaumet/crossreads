<p>Apl 17  On Dental parade for the last time. Understand we go forward to the firing line tomorrow. Still more rain; wonder will it ever take a tumble &amp; give old Sol a chance. Yesty was a glorious day, fine &amp; clear with a gentle breeze. Bombers parade but I paid a visit to my friend the Dentist. Tomorrow we leave for Armentiere.  Called out about 9 oclock tonight as special picket. Dressed in the dark &amp; then marched 3 or 4 miles over hard roads &amp; through sloppy mud for &ndash; nothing and didn't we squeal 'Oh No'. Lobbed home a couple of hr's later &amp; had a good tuck in</p>
<p>18  left for Sailly at 12 &amp; arrived at 3 after an 8 or 9 mile trudge through   mud varying from 1 to 12 ins in depth, (with a couple of spells enroute) Saw a partially ruined Church which had evidently been struck by an incendiary bomb Drizzling rain fell most of the time &amp; [in margin] Sailly</p>
