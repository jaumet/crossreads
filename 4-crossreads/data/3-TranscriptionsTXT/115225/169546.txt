Vermozeele, it was a wretched cold, bleak grey day. We heard bad news from the Somme. I had a parcel from Mary.
Mar 28th We only did one trip again to-day to Vermozeele with R.E. stores. Cold bleak day, it rained in the evening. I wrote in the evening.
Mar 29th Another wet day, we took R.E. stores to Vermozeele in the morning & took the relief party up in the afternoon. Our despatch rides came up with our mail & instructions in the afternoon.
Mar 30th The morning was fine but it turned wet in the afternoon. We took a load of R.E. stores to Vermozeele in the morning, tunneling timbers etc. I made some adjustments to the lorry in the afternoon.
Memo. Very startling news from the Somme this week of a great German advance. We don' know just what to think of it from what we hear, it is said that we are drawing Fritz into a trap & will then cut him off.
