<p>own opinion about the incompetence of such individuals Fortunately we do not stand to arms These times or the men would get about 2 hours sleep in the 24. We don't get too much rest as things are now &ndash; and one can imagine how the men feel when they are dragged around the desert uselessly.</p>
<p>1st August 1916. Romani Tues.</p>
<p>Had a good rest today ready for tonights operations. Three times today we had to turn out of Camp horses &amp; all. A German Taube came right over us but did not drop bombs Our machines were out today. They hovered over the Turkish positions and were heavily shelled but none were brought down. "Pharoah" is going to have a couple of days rest he deserves it very much he has a sore back through excessive riding and he is reduced to skin &amp; bone. There are plenty of sore backs in the regiment now. The desert is too rough on them.</p>
<p>One barrel of beer on issue for the men today 2 pints each very much appreciated and another one tomorrow so I'm told.</p>
