<p>itself is very interesting now.  Last Monday we left the elementary stages of our work &amp; entered what is called here "The Bull Ring".  Our days are divided into hours &amp; each hour we have a change of drill &amp; instructor, just as in the High Schools in Sydney.  Each morning we commence with the hour's march to warm us up &amp; then we spend our time at bombing, bayonet-drill, open order work, lectures, Company drill &amp; physical training.  Some of our men have been doing the musketry course, but only a limited number can do this at once &amp; so I have to wait my turn.  Others likewise are having instruction re gas.</p>
<p>For the last few days or so I have been away from the "Bull Ring".  On Thursday I was on guard &amp; had a rather cold time in the guard-room.  The duties of the guard are twofold, viz. to protect certain of the buildings here, such as the bomb-shed, &amp; also to guard the prisoners.  I was on the latter duty.  We answered the bugle at 3.30 p.m. &amp; <strike>went in</strike> went on duty at 4.  <strike>Guar</strike> Change of guard here is done in</p>
