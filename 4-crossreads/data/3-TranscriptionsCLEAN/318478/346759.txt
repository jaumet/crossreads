Dear Mick
My last letter to you was dated May 7th instead of June 7th.
Yesterday was devoted to finishing my small picture of Tiberius & killing a snake on the way back to Semakh.  The sketch I think will please you, the snake would not neither would the skin.  Sketch 8 in. by 4 in. Snake five feet six & 1/2 inches a coppery dangerous looking creature which took 3 bullets to settle as he was well [indecipherable] between rocks down by the beach or shore of Gallilee.  A bullet is better than a brazen image in these cases.  Referring to miracles I took a dive off the little wooden pier by Semakh this morning entirely failing to realize that I am still marked hospital leave and came out feeling very fit.  Of course I did no stunts just kept afloat.
