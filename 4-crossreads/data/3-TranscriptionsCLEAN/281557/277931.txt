 Friday July 28th = Saturday July 29 
 Sunday July 30th = 31st & August 1st  In Hell & had no chance of writing up so will put down from memory: which is very vivid: 
 Wednesday July 26th etc Trenches: hot day: relieved the 5th Batt in the firing line which is part of Fritz's trench captured yesterday: Fritz still holds the trench both ends of us: the wounded & dead are still lying about while a lot of our poor boys are in "no mans" land: Fritz attacked us at dawn but was repulsed & again attacked & was repulsed a little later: Ern & I then started stretcher bearing & had plenty of work & some awful cases: the Welsh ( 2nd) tried to bomb Fritz out of our dead end & got into his trench but he came back fiercely & would have got into our trench only for our boys rushing to the Welsh's aid: our boys were great & simply defied death standing on the parapet throwing bombs while not a few jumped into no mans land & sniped at the Fritzes: our bombers lost heavily: the bomb fight lasted about 17 hours & was very fierce towards night: we succeeded in holding them: next day (I will run all the days together) the Durhams tried to bomb him out again & our boys had to  80,000 of our bombs were estimated to have been thrown
