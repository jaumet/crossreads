  
 January, 1915 Sunday 24 After all I did not post these notes at Aden as we only stayed a few hours & did not go ashore. This morning we are in the Red Sea & many boats of many nationalities pass us including a patrolling Cruiser, keeping the trade Routes open. A P & O Mail boat also passed, we exchanged greetings - The Coast is rugged & date palms grow at intervals. Patients in hospital are better I am glad to say
