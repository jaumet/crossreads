Dear Captain Peters,
 
   We are much indebted to you for the further collection of records which you have so kindly made available.  I greatly regret that this is the last we shall receive from you, but we are delighted that we have been successful in obtaining so interesting a collection of records as yours. In fact, I think your records comprise one of the most complete collections of personal records which we have.
 
   The introduction which you have compiled will be of much assistance and we are much indebted to you for the trouble you have gone to in preparing it.
 
   Again thanking you for your gernerous response to our appeal for your war records,
 
   Yours sincerely.
 
   Sgnd.  R. Treloar.
