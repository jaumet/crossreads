  
 9/11/17 Poperinghe planes must have been about as many searchlights were focussed just about the town. The flashes of the guns announced the presence of War once again. Drove for 2 hours along rough dark roads with lorries, limbers and motors silently passing. Men trudging on in twos and threes. Occasionally a flare across the sky as some dump catches fire. Pulled up at a hut where the QM.s stove is located and soon got settled down with Miles and the others. Mud and cold everywhere. A few shells screamed overhead towards Belgian Chateau but they appeared to dud owing to the wet ground. Thewlis came staggering in about 9 o'c deluged in mud whitefaced and shaken having been blown up by a shell when going along with the packs & rendered unconscious. Got him put to bed and he soon recovered. This is a change from Rome and Paris! Slept well except for the detonations of a big gun which shook the hut like a drum
