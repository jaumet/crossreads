 My dearest Father, Since I last wrote, I have received two letters from you under date 25th Febry, & 3rd March, for which I thank you very much. We have been extra busy for some weeks past & although kept going hard at it I like the work & surroundings. Before I go any further I must tell you that on the 14th ult. I cabled per Agent General for 12.  This duly came through & I received it a week later.  I know you are worrying about my using so much Cash & wondering  how  I use it; but I will explain as fully as I possibly can, & you will be able to grasp the situation.  Whilst a Driver in France, & even until I was down at Salisbury I was drawing the 2/- per day.  As soon as I was put on the Staff here I was cut down the extra 1/- a day Driver's pay leaving it at 1/-.  The allowance (subsistance) for men stationed in London is 3/6 per day, which brings it to 4/6 p.d.  Meals in London, & food generally is an exhorbitant price, & it is impossible to get a meal anywhere under 1/6. So you see that this 4/6 goes in food alone.  I think I stated in my previous letter that I have a room at HeadQuarters here in One corner of the Medical Dept.  For this the Military dock me 10/- per week, as likewise they do the M.O. (Capt. Shaw) 1 for his two rooms (sitting & bedroom).  I really can't grumble, as I couldn't get  the  a room in town as cheap & as comfortable.  I have every convenience here
