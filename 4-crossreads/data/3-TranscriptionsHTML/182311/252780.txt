<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Please forgive me, I&#39;m very much afraid that a mail has passed without a line from me, but my excuse must be that I have been so hard at it that have had no time and if I may confess, not the inclination, for the field manoeuvres lately have been of the hardest, lectures have been constant and in my <u>spare</u> (save the mark) time I&#39;ve acted as secretary to the Battalion Sports Committee, that meant midnight for about nine nights and two Saturday afternoons lost, but the Sports are fixed now I&#39;m happy to say, and that leaves me time to write.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another job I&#39;ve caught is Company Intelligence Officer, most instructive and interesting but just a bit extra work.&nbsp; However I&#39;m getting into splendid trim, feeling very fit and happy and doing good work, my lads are doing well and at the same time doing me credit and I hear that I&#39;m recommended for my second star, no difference in position or pay, but it gives a fellow seniority and it will be nice to be <u>really a Lieutenant</u>, not a 2nd Lieut. which feels quite a junior rank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m greatly enjoying my letters, I passed them on to Fairweather and he thinks/they are jolly good.&nbsp; Unless my homeletters are personal I post them on to Les, he gets them and enjoys them.&nbsp; I&#39;ve posted you a p.c. photo of 37 of the lads, they had it all fixed after a church parade</p>
