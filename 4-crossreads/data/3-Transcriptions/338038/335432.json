<p>My Dear Father<br/>Your welcome letter of 30th Nov. duly received for which many thanks &ndash; I seem to be a bit behind with mails from home as many of the fellow here have had up to 15th December, but no doubt a little delay in mine is occasioned by their going to Exeter &ndash; Mothers letter of same date is also to hand which I am acknowledging separately with this mail. -<br/>I have been having a fairly strenuous time this last week getting my old show together besides the ordinary routine firing &amp; preparations for defence</p>
