Purchased two cotton singlets for 9d. each (made in Japan). The town has an electric tram system and a train (which I did not see). Sam had dinner at Oriental Hotel for 4/11 and informed me that the dining hall was as large as Sydney Town Hall. During the afternoon the Psyche came into harbour. At  night  5.30 the Governor of Ceylon (A Brigadier General) inspected the ship & troops.  At night large number of boys broke ship and went ashore.  They had a good time - struck trouble with natives on some occasions and nearly all were caught by the town picket and names were taken. Some of our mess  tried  (including self) obtained a pass each to go ashore and got as far as a launch when we were ordered ashore by a Major Hunt. 
  Tuesday  Monday 22nd A muster parade was held at 7 a.m. at which Capt. Vicars took the opportunity of censuring those who went ashore the previous night & informed us that all leave for today was thereby  passed  stopped. At 1 p.m. we weighed anchor and our band struck up "This is the Life" and the ships in harbour farewelled us (including the "Psyche" which was remaining in harbour).
