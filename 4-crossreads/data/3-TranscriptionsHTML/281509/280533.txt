<p>6 November 1916<br/>Monday</p>
<p>Night duty all last night. Felt pretty rotten &amp; weak. bays good &amp; I sleep most of night. Better in morning.  Sleep all day &amp; benefit by rest. Ridgeway takes my place on duty tonight. We are due to go up the lines in a day or two. Terrific gale of wind all last night cold as Antarctica, then more rain. the ground has not been dry for over a month now.</p>
