vulture, which came from Somewhere to make observations, & having been satisfied put on all speed & went away.
Levein ladOne of the Levein boys was in a charge to take a sap head. He was hit in the arm with a bullet. It spun him & he fell into a Turkish trench. When to he was amongst dead men. He managed to crawl out and keeping as close as possible to the ground he reached the edge of the Australian trench & rolled into it. He was picked up and taken to a dressing station. Here he was seen by Whiskey Dawson.
Where are you hit Frank? Only in the elbow. Why you are riddled man. Let us turn you over.
It was found that 6 or 8 bullets had gone through his jacket, but none had touched his body. While he was on the table he was using vile language in rapid sequence. An R.C. padre came along. - Do you think you get relief lad from using the bad language? My God Sir I think I do. Then carry on do not mind my presence.
