<p>has no traffic.</p>
<p>Here I saw a one legged soldier looking mournfully on the hilarity &amp; dancing &amp; then go up &amp; ask a girl for a dance &amp; she pretending not to notice the wooden leg did a few slow turns with him for he had gained the right to such a small return at least that is how this pretty laughing little creature put it though he smiles were lost in tears as she spoke.</p>
<p>We did not dance but moved on to Montmartre</p>
<p>14-7-19<br/>I have called this 14-7-19 but really there was no division line. I do not know where midnight found me.</p>
<p>Montmartre ie Boul-Clichy, Rochechouart has been transformed into a pleasure ground. Side Show, [indecipherable] shows for real champagne swings, aeroplanes, merrygorounds of all kinds from motor cars to pigs, steam swings, relics from Noumea. Every conceivable side show is there.</p>
<p>We visit steam swings a contrivance which succeeded in frightening more girls than all other side shows combined &amp; hence most popular. Ride last about 2 minutes &amp; costs 1 fr Merrygorounds are usually hand propelled &amp; cost 50c. The machine asks a pourboire but never gets any.</p>
<p>The relics of torture were good but nothing from Noumea was visible though this is what attracted me. We saw pancakes</p>
