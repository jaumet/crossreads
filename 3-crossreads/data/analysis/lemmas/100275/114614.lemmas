 10th . This morn we left our billet in Lavigcona , it was just start to drizzl , so the order was given for everyon to put their waterproof on . I had none for I dump it at our last billet on account of the weight , so I had to fall back on the old chaff bag , she kept me dri as a bone It was a veri stiff march the road were greasi slipperi , which made the walk anyth but easi , we pass on our way through Herrisart a fair size villag . Reach our destin Loutencourt , everyon was about knock out .
