<p>2 May 1916 Tues<br/>Pitching large hospital tents very nearly all day which is another rotten job. Lieut Dacey brought in belonging to 16th A.S.C. Took charge of the officers ward. A good job only one patient. Adjourned to the estaminet several times through the day with Steve.</p>
<p>3 May 1916 Wed<br/>Getting tent in order. Lieut Pearce comes in not too good. By cripes he says what would I give for a brandy &amp; soda now. Several of the enemies shells fell within short distance of us to-day. Went to Steenwerck with Harry Benson tonight &amp; called to see Lawrence. I thought the old barn would stop one to-night. Big shell.</p>
