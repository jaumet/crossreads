<p>April 12<br/>48.<br/>At Amiens.<br/>Dinner just outside Amiens by the south of the Cathedral, with mean little minds some have whispered of shells landing in the building, but I think it is still a lie:  God knows how long though this will be &ndash; even while we were there a great shell burst between it and us, and for half an hour several guns were all the while trained on the City.</p>
<p>One Boche plane was brought down &ndash; from quite 8000 feet a long uninterrupted nose dive, our three planes spiralling above him.</p>
<p>Marching through &ndash; only three dead horses by the boulevard, and a lovely white-faced girl sitting on a seat loaded with two sheeted bundles, all the sorrow of the city on her face.</p>
<p>Since midday we've been by a narrow stream:  a fair number were in swimming, but lovely as the day is and warm the sun, the dirty mud of the bank is horrible.</p>
<p>The 2nd Field have entrained and gone.</p>
<p>Last night a big number of the 2nd Batt. knocked here, about 12 killed from bombs.  Evening:  In the train, trucks.  The 2nd Batt. are an unlucky crowd.  At B.B. Corner bombs lost them over 80:  and last night bombs here in Amiens, and shells lost them 12 dead, and 40 wounded.</p>
<p>In Train just out saw Vim Colours:  but he'd gone on by an earlier train with B. Coy.  Must look him up.</p>
<p>Basil B. brings cutting to truck of 2nd Lieut Alan Waugh being reported missing:  he was engaged to a daughter of W.W. Jacobs.</p>
<p>Back to Flanders!</p>
<p>April 13<br/>49.<br/>In the train:  past Hazebruck, all the little villages passed in daylight show shell and bomb wreaking:  and looking down through long roads, thin lines and groups of refugees.  Passing one little farmhouse by the line, through the open door and window an old woman and a girl were sorting and tying bundles:  bomb holes were new in their fields.</p>
<p>Once we passed the wreakage of a truck of a Tommy troop train, two hundred yards further along, lying stripped to the waist, a splendidly built Tommy lay half over a stream washing.</p>
<p>50.<br/>For a long while last night. Boche planes dropping bombs &ndash; about 50 dropped &ndash; by the line and station held up our going.  The Artillery were in the station:  and just as we'd entrained saw amongst them young Street of the Grammar.  I saw him last awaiting the tram in College St., two back his year &ndash; yesterday he had some little more.</p>
