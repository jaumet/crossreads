<p>France<br/>31.1.17</p>
<p>Dear mother,</p>
<p>Thousands of letters! Battalions panting rumours are falling over each other in their endeavours to convey sheafs of correspondence, to their rightful owners. Order is gradually developing from chaos, &amp; 'All's well with the world'.</p>
<p>The photographs were scented with the breath of HOME, wattle, petrol launches &amp; other things that make life worth the living. They sorted themselves out before my eyes till I could see, very dimly I'll admit, a moving picture show of the whole picture. You were just a little nervous of the launch weren't you? &amp; what a lazy little devil Geo is when firewood is the order of the day.</p>
<p>By dint of careful thought I have managed to sort them out in their proper order.</p>
