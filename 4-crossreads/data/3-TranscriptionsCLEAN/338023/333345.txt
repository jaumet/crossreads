five hundred yards in front of our lot - somersaulted - hit nose down - crunch!  S.O.s etc on horses went off like mad - our lot following. Being on bike I got in second in time to help a Brass Lid pull the observer out. Game bugger that one - tho only a 2nd Lt.  Sat up & told us he was alright, laughed, asked how it happened, and passed on. The pilot was un-scratched, having been flung clear in long grass & scrub. The machine - the wasn't any left to call one. Do you know, I feel envious of that kid - he seemed to have struck some huge joke that made him laugh at us all and made us feel as tho he, in some way, had put the double X on us all.
At present I'm hoping they'll give me a new tunic soon as they have promised. Am now in the role of sig. instructor - training a few raw youths to fill the job should we be forced, by some un-foreseen circs., to leave it suddenly.
No more news, no more light, so will will imitate the Cotter River in summer, with much love to all from Harry.Unit now: 23rd AUST  Mac. Gun. coy.
