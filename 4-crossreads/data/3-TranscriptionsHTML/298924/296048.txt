<p>Friday 7 March 1919<br/>Busy at A.I.F. &amp; Cooks etc. re Dolly's passage, going by Derbyshire on Mch. 12.  I think I will go Suez with her.  Do not say to her re another Babe till I get home.  Had lunch at Turf Club &amp; went to Polo in afternoon.  The Regt. goes in Ulimaroa about same time, pretty rotten Husband &amp; Wife not being allowed to travel together.  The wife is quite ready after a night's rest to go strait on home to Deniliquin.  I do hope Joe will meet her if he can.  I will have to go on to Sydney with my Regiment.</p>
