Spoilt a film this evening trying to develop it, think I will turn the developing up & do my printing only.14th. Had us all out on Batt. drill this morning, I had plenty to do & was well in the limelight first as a Coy. commander, then platoon, & finally guide to the Battalion.After finishing this hanged if we did not have to go & get inoculated with T.A.B. they run the needle well in, & far enough round so that you could not suck it out without a lot of trouble, this is a great game with all of us after inoculation, sucking the injection out of the arm, but the Drs. are beginning to drop to it.
