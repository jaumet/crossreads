but very precious, I didn't do nearly all the things I should have done (e.g. see the Tower &c., &c.) & did many &c. but London is some city & was looking absolutely beautiful, & I've never seen so many beautiful girls in my life as those first 2 days in London, after that they weren't so beautiful or didn't appear so - what struck me most was the shortness of the skirts.  Everyone seemed to be about 14, & the daintiness of the feet, ankles (&stockings with legs included) most refreshing I can tell you after service boots - but I'm particularly susceptible to dainty feet & footwear - I met many English girls, none of whom can come up to my imagination mind to the Australian girls & I'm not petty or small minded or parochial or insular or small little Australian or anything like that, its the Dinkum oil - I met one particularly charming girl though who if she wasn't Lady Somebody I'd feel very tempted to fall in love with, she was the sweetest & most natural girl I've ever seen, simple & unaffected but I don't think she'd do for a Dr's wife in an upcountry town - why wasn't I born a Duke!.  She's of Scotch descent too, another tremendous recommendation.  I also got my photo taken & will really send you one when they come over.
My love to John & Graham & the usual portion to yourself, please continue the good work of writing often.  Best of the best to you,
CheersJ.B. Metcalfe
