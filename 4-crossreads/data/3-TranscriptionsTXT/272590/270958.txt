October, 1917So every man was issued with buttonholed tabs and buttons to sew on to his great coat, thus:-

The coat could then be tucked up to two different lengths as desired. The idea came in very handy at times.  There was an amazing scene one Sunday on parade.  Some N.C.O.'s had returned to Hurdcott from France &ndash; overcoats neatly folded on their packs.  However, one wet Sunday the order was for overcoats on parade.  They appeared with their greatcoats reaching the length of their tunics, the inside pockets hanging down several inches lower than the coats.

The only additions are those which cover facts that I did not, at the time, deem desirable to include.)

We then formed up on the parade ground to listen to a short lecture from the C.O.  There were nine of us going to the 30th and about the same number for each of the other 8th Brigade battalions &ndash; 29th, 31st and 32nd.  It seemed a lot of signallers to be sending
