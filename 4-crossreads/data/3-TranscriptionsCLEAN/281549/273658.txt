 On January the 5th we had a very hard frost which froze everything & made walking very hard, The ground was so slippery that it was hardly possible to walk about without slipping. Till January the 18th we had snow falls every day, sometimes it was accompanied with rain, every day it was bitterly cold. 
 On the 18th it thawed which made it very wet underfoot. The snow continued to thaw until it finally dissapeared on January the 23rd. On Thursday 24th I got a postcard album with a lot of different views of L&uuml;neburg on it, A chap belonging to the Welsh Guards presented it to me.
