<p>September 7th: -<br/>Informed this morning that we were to have a good time as to-morrow would see us on our boat.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we did, starting with a motor trip to Bitterne &amp; from here to St Denys which lies also along the river. At the baths again in the afternoon and to the Palace after tea, finishing with a hilarious supper party at the "Grosvenor" where we have had many a pleasant meal since our arrival in this town.</p>
<p>Retired at 2 am pleased that we were going, yet loth to leave a place of such pleasant recollections as this recalls.</p>
<p>September 8th: -<br/>At 9 am sharp we marched out of camp arriving on board at 10 am.</p>
<p>At 11 am she moved into the stream and after lunch we began work on the wards which were full of rubbish of all descriptions. Along with 3 others I was assigned to F1 and 2 where there are 182 beds all told and where we went hard at it until 5 pm.</p>
<p>Off duty after tea and to bed early knowing that to-morrow would bring plenty to do for us all.</p>
<p>September 9th: -<br/>In Convalescent wards all day. Bed frames scalded and walls washed along with ports. This brought a fine old sweat out on us for the day</p>
