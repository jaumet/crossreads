23/1/18 Crieff
A rather finer day but still very Scotch misty. Walked with the two girls up to the Knock ? a high peak just behind the town. Ordinarily from here there is a very fine view but just now it is all obscured by the fog clouds and such little glimpses as could be got disclosed patches of vanishing snow among the little woods of fir and other trees. We were yarning after our lunch and did not move out until 4 when we went down to tea with the Hunter Smiths at the Manse. There seems a variety of churches here. (U.P. U.F Established c) Spent the evening with the family round the fire. Later Dr Mrs. Burnet came and we had some music. After they had left we stayed up talking until close on midnight and then turned in. Honest direct and straight out people are the Scotch. There is an absence of affectation and artificiality that is common to the English.
