<p>19 August 1918<br/>Monday<br/>Arrived Cape Town &amp; tied up about 10.30 AM. Had leave into town in the afternoon with Sgt Brindly R.Q.M.S. Clarke Sgt Rees. Took a tram trip to Camp Bay &amp; back via Koof Nek . It is a very nice &amp; interesting trip. In the evening we went to see Three Weeks at the Opera House. The Acting was only just fair. Cape Town appears to be a fairly well built little City but I was rather disappointed on my first visit Arrived back at Boat about 11.30 P.M.</p>
<p>1918 August 20<br/>Tuesday<br/>Stationed as Piquet in Police station<strike>ed</strike> till 10 P.M. Got very little time off. Had a look around town with Sgt Brindly for awhile in the afternoon &amp; for a couple of hours in the evening. A very hot day. The people of Cape Town do not to me appear to be very hospitable - at least not toward the Australians. But I may be mistaken as I have not seen much of them. However appearances do not give one a good impression. Got back off duty to boat about 11 P.M. very tired &amp; with the usual headache</p>
