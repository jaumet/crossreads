Well I am writing this letter in a hurry, as we are packing up to move. All the chaps from around Kojonup & Katanning are in the best of health & spirits, but would like to get back again. Of course you will have seen Levi long before you recieve this letter & will hear a lot of news from him.
Remember me to all my friends, tell them it is impossible to write to them, I am only writing to you & Nell & Mrs. Birt Bilney an odd card to others. Tell Olive I will write to her when I can get more time. Well I must close with wishing you both the very best of Good Health & Luck. I am pleased that you have Lassie. Kind regards to the Boss. I must close with sending you my Love & best wishes. God Bless & take care of you. Good Bye for the present.
I remainYour ever lovingW. Weaber
Kisses for youX X X X XX X X X XX X X X
