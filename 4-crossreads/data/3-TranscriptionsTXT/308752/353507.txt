 our satisfaction, in fact we were often disappointed when we found that they were not included in the menu. The French people after indulging in two good solid meals a day, does not require much breakfast. At the hotel where we put up, a cup of cocoa &amp; a small roll of bread was sent up to our room each day at 7 a.m. I rather like the idea. We naturally did not waste much time over our breakfast, so always got an early move on, to tour the sights of Gay Paree.

 On the following morning we changed our diggings &amp; put up at the Hotel Nouvel, Rue La Fayette. Our rooms were very comfortable &amp; beautifully furnished. Getting an early start on we began our tour of the city. Visited
