Some are even worse than I am poor George Horan is nearly dead & has no further interest in life.We were issued with shoes trousers & coats today for the trip.
6th.  Have had a dreadful day splitting headaches & crook all over don't scarcely care what happens.  I lay in the one place for exactly 7 hours today & was incapable of moving even if I wanted to do so, so sick was I, but tonight thank heaven there is a slight improvement, how the old tub is rolling something dreadful bangs the world I don't know what she wouldn't do if she struck a real heavy sea.Saw a couple of whales spouting today we could not see them too plain for they were a fair way off & heavy rollers kept on obscuring them.One could notice the difference in the air today compared to yesterday it was quite [indecipherable] & the sun shone nearly the whole day.
