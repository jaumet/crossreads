9 February 1918 SaturdayStill raining & snow on the Hills  just heard WADI GHUZZI washed Railway Line away again so rations & horsefeed will be scarcer.Oranges are now issued in lieu of vegetables.The horse Lines get ankle deep in mud & we've not had a decent wash for days-Rum issue every night.  Boils under both arms & Skin trouble little better, only trifles, but not pleasant in the wet soldiering.
