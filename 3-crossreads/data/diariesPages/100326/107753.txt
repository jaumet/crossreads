12/9/15 but the other "absolutely blown to pieces by shrapnel, but by God's grace I was spared and charged ahead, killing five Turks, until we cleared them all out." This fellow had never been within half a mile of a Turk. Another writing to his sister. "I reckon one of us boys is equal to any three of these black cows in a dinkum fight." All very pleased with their food and remark how different it is to what they expected. At the present moment, 1420, not a sound of shooting is to be heard we might be miles away from war or anything else. Yet only four hundred yards away the other army is lying quiet also, both on the watch ready to leap out at each other but not daring to on account of the inferno that would break loose before one man had traversed 10 yards. Sitting down in fire trench, men cleaning their rifles, sleeping eating so on and only to poke his head up a few inches over the top sandbag means sudden death. Shots on both sides very good ? constant practice. Our chaps the Turks can put a bullet through a small loophole every time Great expression "possy" means position. A man got a comfortable place to sleep announces ? "gotter good possy"
