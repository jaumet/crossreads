on the Isle of Wight, also to the large vessel Aquitania - a hospital Ship. I slept well from going across the Channel.
14th Disembarked at le Havre at 7am. - visited Officers' Club. Then walked about until 10am. Then took Harfleur train to report at Camp.
After reporting to Camp Adjutant had a long walk to our 4th. Division Camp. After Lunch at 4ADBD I got leave & again returned to le Havre. Walked about the streets - some very fine streets & buildings - an extremely busy port. A few fine Boulevards. Changed 9 into francs. Trammed to St Adresse beach. Went to Revue after dinner - but it did not start until 9.10pm & my last tram was at 10, so I saw only one part. Got lost among the camps returning to 4th. Div Camp & it took a great deal of walking to reach my tent.
