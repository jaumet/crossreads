<p>Dear Mother and Father,<br/>Tomorrow is the last day of my furlough, so I am just settling down to give you an idea of what I have been doing in the last fortnight in London. As you may guess I have had a great time, perhaps I owe a good deal for that to Mrs Cust the lady I have been staying with,She has been extremely good to me and could not do too much to make my stay a happy one. As I think I told you before, she is the wife of Rear Admiral Purly Cust and only has two children, her son Jack is a lieutenant in a destroyer and her little girl Peggie is a dear little kid of 12. Tomorrow I will be going back to a camp at Perham Downs near Salisbury, and then I suppose it will not be long before I shall be joining up my battalion again.</p>
<p>Well , I came up to London on the 26th July Mrs Cust met me at Euston, and after I had completed my business at Headquarters we spent the day in town together. Since then it has been one round of sight seeing</p>
