26th contdWe had a long yarn about old times & was very much interested in the Coffs Harbor & Dorrigo district.  I went to Croydon with him & stayed at the Fergusons.
27th NovrCollected my baggage together ready to go home.  Met Mrs Jno Beaumont & Mavis Edwards on the train at Ashfield & got some Yanco news.  Went out to Drummoyne by the 10.15am boat & stayed there the rest of the day.  Called in at the Farmer & Settler office & saw Mr Morice & Normie.  They told me of Dorothy's engagement.   Mr Morice wants me to contribute news from time to time to the F & S & is going to provide me with a duplicate diary for that purpose.  Caught the 7.15 Glen Innes mail & wired Doug
