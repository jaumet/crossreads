4th. Kings Regt.B. E. F.France,13-3-18.
Dear Mr. Rich,The attached will interest you, but please note that it must not be used in any official way, and as it was the subject of Recommendation for a Reward, it is an extract from a confidential document.
As the matter is now nearly 3 years old and your son is only one of many hundreds of gallant fellows who were not rewarded for their work, I am sending you the extract.
The wording of the report is that of his Company Commander (now Lieutenant Col Derviche Jones D.S.O./M.C. 2/8 London Regt.) and it will show that your son's good work on this occasion was brought to notice. It was a great disappointment to those who knew him that no actual Reward followed.
After commanding 1/King's for a year I was silly enough to get fever last Summer and was send home sick. I came out again in January and to my disgust instead of going back to my old Command I was sent here to the 4th. Bn. which just then fell vacant. However, as this is a really good Bn. (as all the King's are) I am lucky to be in Command again as quickly.
Yours very sincerely(sgd) S.E. Norris.
Lieutenant J.S. Rich.For gallantry and devotion to duty on the 16th. & 17th. May 1915 at Richebourg in leading his platoon across "No man's land" under very heavy fire and subsequently in a further attack on the Ferme Cour D'Avoue on the 17th. when his platoon was ordered to withdraw from a difficult position, by coolness and his ability he was able to effect this with success and with very few casualties. Lieut. J.S. Rich was exceptionally brave on this occasion running great personal risks to ensure the safety of his men. He was killed almost at the moment when the operation was concluded.
