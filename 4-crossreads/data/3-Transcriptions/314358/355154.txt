<p>Wareham<br/>Dorset<br/>England</p>
<p>28 April 1917<br/>To 'Our Children'</p>
<p>There is only a little party of us.<br/>We are supposed to be isolated on account of mumps and measles outbreaks in out hut.</p>
<p>But as idleness is not good for the troops the S.W.O has ordered light excercise</p>
<p>The O.C. thereupon issues orders to the company S.M. that we are to go for a route march in full marching order.</p>
<p>The S.M. orders our hut corporal to see that this is carr5ied into effect.</p>
<p>Our hut Corporal fall us in. Numbers us off, forms us into fours, gives us "Quick march" and off we go.</p>
<p>Down a steep grassy bank at the rear of the camp we settle onto a flint road below.</p>
