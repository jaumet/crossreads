<p>had a destroyer escorting us for a while, but she left us yesterday.<br/>These lifebelts which we have to carry about on us, are an awful nuisance. At first we just carried them in our hands but orders came out that we have to wear them.<br/>1700 Still at Malta there are now four troopships in the bay, &amp; a N.S.A. boat came in. We have been swimming in the bay all afternoon, diving in off the side, &amp; climbing up a ladder. The water is very buoyant. I stayed in for a few minutes only. From 6 to 9 Pm I go on signal duty on the boat deck.<br/>Managed to get a snap of the swimmers, but have to be very careful not to show the camera, as cameras are strictly forbidden. For this reason &amp; that it took up so much space I left the developing tank behind at <strike>Ferry P</strike> Moascar.<br/>Island of Malta 26th. 16<br/>The four troopships are still in the bay, &amp; the yankey boat with the flag painted on sides is here also. This place looks very nice in the morning light, there are a lot of peculiar buildings scattered over the hills, &amp; there is a row along the waters edge, one of these, I made out through the telescope to be the Duncan Hotel Kept</p>
