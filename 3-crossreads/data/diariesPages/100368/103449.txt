men was spoken to by a foreigner, presumably a Frenchman, in a peremtory fashion. When the conductor came round for our fares, he did not ask this Frenchman and four other companions for their fares. Our man saw his chance of getting "one" in on him. When the conductor asked for his fare he said "Mafish Falouse" meaning that he had no money "Bohkara", To-morrow. The conductor looked at him anything but pleased and used threat and persuasion alternately but all to no avail, and he ultimately gave up asking for it. All the men in Khaki refused to pay up and we thought it a huge joke. We had not gone very far, however, when a tram inspector came aboard and asked us to produce our ticket. "Ask for these mens fares first" replied the man who had first refused to pay his fare. The foreigners looked at the inspector then at one another in surprise. They had apparently been permanent ticket holders and when they produced their passports every one was satisfied and laughingly paid up.

Sept 23rd Thurs.
Visited the Casino which is situated on the promenade by the side of the sea. 
This is really a Kinema and Concert Hall laid out with little tables and chairs like a Restaurant. You pay for drinks which includes the price of the concert or Kinema. 
The show was not very much worth.
