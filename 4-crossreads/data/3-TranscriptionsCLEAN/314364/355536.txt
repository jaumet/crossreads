  
 Mon. Jan. 13. My confrere, Riley, got word to go away today & board the Boat. Very quick notice, too.  So she must be going soon. [indecipherable] the chap in the next Bed to me is on the same Boat. Sgt. [indecipherable] his Q.M. is married & his wife lives in the village, so he gets Home every night. I wish I was so near to my wife as he is. Anyhow I will be soon, with a bit of Luck. Tues.14. The next Boat Roll should soon be out if she sails on the 20th. Gee I'm mighty anxious to see it. "Andy" the Q.M.'s assistant returned from Leave last night. I slept in his store between sheets. Some class. Bill Beard also came back last night. He tells me that he got engaged before leaving. It seems catching. There's a chap in my Hut "Taffy" Evans, who is going away on marriage Leave on the 28th. There won't be many single men in the AIF soon. Wed. Jan. 15th Another wet day. "Andy" & I had a busy day sorting & stacking washing. They put me on a new Job today making out the Tobacco List. We are able to buy Tobacco & Cigarettes at "duty free" prices instead of having to pay 5 1/2 d for a Packet of 10 Cigs we get em for 2 1/2 d which is a mighty big difference in these days of cash shortage. Bert Berry is on the "Marga", so I'm hopng to see my name appear on the [indecipherable] Roll. Sgt Cropley (who is in charge of the Hospital) says this Roll is not coming out for another week or so. I really ought to write some letters but I'm hanged if I can settle down to the Job. I did manage to scribble a few lines to Mrs Sano & asked her to send my Diary along. Thur.16. The sun is actually shining this morning & it looks like being fine. Beautiful, Greasy stew for Breakfast again. Had a busy morning making out the Tobacco List & collecting money for same. It's such a long time since I did any clerical work that I felt quite awkward.
