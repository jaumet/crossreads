Dull but fine - Heavy bombardment still continues, looking forward to something big if it keeps fine - very few casualtys in today, but the Australians are coming in by dozens - sick trench feet - effects of cold etc. Fritz shelled the Advanced Dressing Station at Thistle Dump - injured seriously 4 Bearers & killed two - 6th & 7th Stretcher Bearers have had a lot of casualtys in the field since we came out - Got hold of a paper today & it referred to the coolness of a Battalion that Fritz caught while changing over in broad daylight - it said in spite of heavy casualtys, they just continued as if nothing had interrupted - this happened to be the 54th Batt - coming out & the 56th going in, well do I remember it - I was right in it & make special mention of being extra busy on Nov 1st. Saw 2 Taubs brought down in good style this evening. Fritz shelled our quarters here for about half an hour during the night - nobody injured, a few waggons etc destroyed, nearest shell to where I was in
