<p>France&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 21.8.16<br/>22.6.1916.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>Just the day after I posted my last letter to you on the 15th inst I received yours of 23rd of April for which I thank you very much.<br/>Things have been much the same here since last mail.  I went up on Saturday to where Rid is &amp; together we went to that part of the trenches where Wal is.  I was very thankful to find him unscratched even and I sincerely hope &amp; pray that he will pull through none the worse for it.<br/>It is a miserably wet tonight &amp; in fact has been raining on &amp; off for the whole week.  Naturally everything is very muddy &amp; sloppy</p>
