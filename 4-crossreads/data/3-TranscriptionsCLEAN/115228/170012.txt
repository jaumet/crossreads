 out & too demoralised to show fight. 
  Nov 16th :- Moved on again today to within about 5 miles of Jaffa. The country we are now in is some of the finest I have ever seen, orchards of oranges, figs, dates and almonds are everywhere to been seen. The oranges are now well in season & we manage to do them justice. Only a few shells flying around today, Passed two or three more villages. 
  Nov 19th :- Outpost duty tonight.
