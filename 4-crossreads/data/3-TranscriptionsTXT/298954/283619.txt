I went to the concert in the evening with my aviator pal from the West Indies.   It was an awful show - even allowing that we are in a prison-camp.   The pianist was excellent in an overture, then came a stupid French farce & then Colonel Lord Farnham gave "Off to Philadelphia".   The Noble Lord is a genial personality with a likeable manner but an appalling voice!   However, "Philadelphia" got much polite applause.
Then came an English sketch which was so bad that it was quite good.   The "heroine's" final "Damn you! John" in the first act was a scream, but, alas, 'twas meant to be tragic.   Farnham appeared in the sketch & is a better actor than he is a singer.
Sun 7thI was tea-ed this afternoon by Rundle, a little fat lieut. from Bristol or thereabouts.
Sardines, toast, cake, de Reszke cigarettes & good tea provided such a splash as I have not had for ages.
