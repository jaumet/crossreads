1917 Wednesday 21 March
Cold windy again. Stay in tent all day. This spell is rejuvenating us all.
Hayman Ridgway self walk into Albert after tea for papers. Witness the passing through of troops cavalry. Albert was full of them all hurrying to the front. It was a most inspiring sight. The first time our cavalry has been called on to do anything of moment on the Somme. Indian British passing on hours at a time. The great panoply of war.?a stupendous organisation truly.
