<p>here, though I haven't a penny in my pocket and it is now to late to go to the bank. I don't like asking my chum for the loan of some though he has plenty, I suppose on account of my dashed pride which I don't think will ever leave me, but anyway I'll have to get 2/6 off someone to keep me till the morning.</p>
