Monday 1 May 1916Same spring weather. At the dentist's in the morning while the company was up on the range. Before lunch went down to the stream to have a bath & had the misfortune to cut my right toe on a piece of bottle. Got it fixed up by the doctor & then had to lie up, missing the May Day Sports held by the Canadians on the football ground on the other side of the line. Also missed the "Society" dinner held in Etaples. A heavy storm with drenching rain worked up about 8.30, the rain continuing most of the night.
