25th. Moved today from "Patricia Camp" we marched out after a short distance caught the motors, which were to convey us to our next stopping place.
We in our tent had a funny experience last night, the wind was blowing a howling gale the whole night through our old tent was gradually getting slacker slacker, but no one would get up tighten the ropes pegs, at 5 oclock down she come, the rifles which were hanging on the pole came clattering down, I got my fair issue of them including one fair on my big toe, nearly squashed it, when she come down Bluey Dimock I who were sleeping together were left out in the open for we were laying with our heads to the wind when this happened we all decided to lay there rather than get up fix her, talk about a mix up, we were all grabbing one another's bedclothes mixed up with rifles, equipment etc, I was laying next to our little pantry got mixed up with sardines biscuits mugs, etc. oh we had some fun but we stuck it out till morning
