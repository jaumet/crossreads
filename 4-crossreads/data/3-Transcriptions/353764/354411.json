<p>Nothing of much interest in the last few days.  I am patiently awaiting orders from HeadQrs as to the re-distribution of the Company.<br/>What I have heard up to date is that a certain percentage of the Company is to be sent to Alexandria, the rest remaining here.  I have to remain with the rest.<br/>Major Gen Cox has command of our Division &amp; will prove a good man.<br/>I am very sorry that we have to split our Company as we are all well known to one another.</p>
<p>25.2.16 Friday<br/>The change in our Company has now been effected &amp; in consequence of same we will now loose half our men.<br/>This is very sickening for us all, as we have been like brothers right from the jump.<br/>Half our men go to Alexandria to form part of the 10th A.S.C. Hd Qrs. 5 Div Train, whilst the rest go to Helmieh to form the 14th  Hd Qrs Coy, 4th Div Train.  I remain with the later &amp; the W.O. goes with the former.  It may or may not mean promotion for me.<br/>I stayed up working until &frac12; past 2 this morning in arranging which men were to go.  It was made</p>
