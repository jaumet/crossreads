  
 Men coming into hospital wholesale I must say that I can see our camp or rather where our boys are camped opposite us, across a narrow strip of water. Back very sore. 
 25-9-15 Terrible the cold this morning wind blowing nearly a gale. I am told that our battalion was paid a beautiful sum of 1-0-0  Rumour that Greece has declared or rather has given Bulycort 24 hour to know what she is going to do. Things very tame here other than war arguatment I was issued with a pair of trousers & shirt to go to the base. 
 26-9-15 Still in hospital, nothing doing, other & to eat & sleep. 
 27-9-15 Another Rumour to hand to day Re the French have advanced 80 miles & captured 20 000 prisoners, Germans. Looks like rain here. Terribly sky. 
 28-9-15 I noticed a big number of men returning to camp I am told that they have returned from England. Talk about war rumour being spun they are manufactured here by the dozens (Latrine Wires as they are called) Back very sore still. I think it is more serious than I thought at first. 
 29-9-15 Things are just a quiet as ever, men still streaming in sick. Hospitals full up with sick. 
 30-9-15 Beautiful mornings I bought a little Butter mind you I dodged out of the Hospital to do so. It was just the thing. I also went over to the camp to see if there were any letters there were none. Well they were paying the men of our Brigade I asked them would they pay me. But I got the answer no shoved down my neck. As I was coming back towards camp I saw which I thought was smoke coming from a southerly directions but by by five oclock I knew what it was. A Beautiful fog  One could not see fifty yards away. 
 1-10-15 It was a beautiful morning Re the Fog talk
