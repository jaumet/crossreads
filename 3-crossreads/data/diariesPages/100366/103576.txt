 
few High Explosives but they are falling in open fields, & doing no damage, As long as they keep their range at that, their only result will be wasted ammunition.

Great satisfaction is again expressed over another Zeppelin having been brought down This makes the 5th within 21 days, & considering the trivial damage done in comparison to the cost of their machines & the loss of highly tried mechanics they will be goff strafing England again.

Our machines brought down another observation balloon having killed the observer & cut it loose by machine gun fire it drifted over our lines, when one of our machines diving from a great height dripped a bomb on it & set it alight, when it hurlted down at a great speed in flames.

Our 13th Brigade Battalions have moved up to the trenches today, but it is a comparatively quiet front, so no startling events will mark their re-appearance in the front line.

Still raining & nothing doing. Last night there was a raid on the enemies trenches near Ypres which was successful.

At the present moment the Germans are treating us to some "Jack Johnsons" which make one want to keep out of their road
