27th) Some heavy showers fell last night making things very uncomfortable. Preparations being made this morning for another advance. Heavy Bombardment from our Warships and land Batteries start about 4.30 this afternoon and lasted for over an hour, then we went mad climbed over the parapets and down the slope in front of our trenches, but the Turks were quite ready for us and our Coy was cut up badly before we had gone 100 yards, but we scrambled on another 50 yards and got into dead ground and dodged the bullets for a time. Then after a blow we were off again, but the Turks machine guns got busy and it was deemed best to retire to our old position. Our casualties were very heavy Lieut,s Brierly Gardner were both badly wounded, several of our lads who were left wounded managed to crawl back after night fall, and others were carried back by their comrades. So once again we failed to dislodge the tough old Turk.
28th) Pretty brisk rifle fire kept up by both sides all night, at day-break there was a proper mix-up, Turks and our lads at pretty close quarters. Many Turkish Infantry show great recklessness to get a shot in, some even standing on the Parapets of their trenches and blazing away at the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, then our chance came for a little sniping and one could hardly miss them they presented such targets. The Turks soon discovered where the sniping came from and sent a few shots our way, we lost no time in ducking our heads, but poor old Whelan got one in the chest, just gave a groan fell, we took him to the rear of the fireing line and Cpl Shields had the top of his head blown right off. Turkish Artillery shell our trenches this afternoon killing 3 men and wounding 5 others. We have very little cover at present from their shell fire as they can almost enfilade our fire trench. We were relieved about midnight by the 16th Battln. All our boys done up need a good rest.
