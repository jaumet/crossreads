 My darling Eddy., 
 On Thursday I received a letter from Auntie Ethel with some cuttings from you. They are very pretty   &  think you are getting a very clever boy. Hope you are quite well   &  strong this term   &  shall be able to go every day to school. When I come home you must have a few days holiday   &  will will have a picnic. Hope Miss Tolhurst is still at the school   &   that she is well. 
 Fondest love   &  kisses XOXOX From XOXOXOX  Auntie Eadle
