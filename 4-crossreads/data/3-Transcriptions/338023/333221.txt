<p>26.10.16<br/>At Sea</p>
<p>My Dear Mother<br/>I am writing on the off chance of getting this away, just to let you know that things are as they should be with us. Cant tell you anything about who's who or what's what but the ship is a good one, small but comfortable &amp; well equipped for her job. The tucker is tip top &amp; as for work ---- It's a loafer's heaven. We just eat, sleep, read &amp; smoke. I'm stony, but that does not matter as there's <strike>nothing to</strike>no city to spend cash in. The weather has been fair to middling &amp; most of the crowd deadly sick. Some of the poor beggars look as if they cant realise what has happened to them, &amp; as a result they make good pictures of Crusoe for a caricaturist. They  just lie round &amp; look as if the end of the world had come. If this is sea sickness I hope it may never get me. So far as I'm concerned this trip can last for months. It's a great rest to get away from the land for a bit &ndash; from the smoke &amp; newspapers. Our quarters are fine. We sleep in hammocks a la HM Navy &amp; they are mighty comfortable after the tents &amp; huts. We go to bed early &amp; get up about 6.30. By the time we get there, I guess I'll be about 12 stone &amp; then some. Don't be surprised if I take quite a fancy to the sea life when the wars over. Please remember me to all the folk &amp; tell Betty I'll write to her next. With much love, keeping plenty for yourself, from Harry</p>
