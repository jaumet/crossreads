<p>Pieroits from the 36 Ulster Division, and the greater part of the 10 Brigade attended.<br/>General  Monash inspected the Brigade today, and we have been very busy this past few days getting ready for it.<br/>It has been fine this evening but it is going to be wet again to night &amp; we don't relish the prospect of again sleeping out in the open.<br/>I have not seen any newspapers for several days.<br/>To night a terrible storm came on, the rain fell in torrents, the wind blew with terrific force, &amp; I thought it was going to blow the tents away, and the lightening came in blinding flashes, and the thunder was awful. It was the worst storm I have seen for years. Fortunately it did not last long. It commenced about 9.00 &amp; was over about 10. p.m. We would have been wet through only we took the precaution to erect the mess cart cover over our beds, &amp; fixed up the sides with bags &amp; limbre covers, and the whole tied securely to the ground.</p>
<p>Friday June 29, 1917. (1061).<br/>It is fine this morning but the ground is wet, and the creek running through the Valley is running a banker.<br/>Just before the storm reached its climax last night one of the baloons was brought. Fritz had been shelling it but whether a shell hit it or it was struck by lightening I cannot say. A ray of light shot away from the baloon &amp; it collapsed &amp; gradually floated down to earth. The baloon did not catch fire.</p>
