why we are here, whence we came, and to what end does all lead. You must add to the picture groves to small trees in all directions.  Must dress for breakfast & work.
12-55 p.m. - Were we in Australia one would still think that rain might fall before the sun would set.  The sun has not come from behind the clouds so far.  The early morning was chilly, but as morning wore on the temperature became comfortable, such as one might have in Sydney during the winter time.  Sydney is some 6 further South than we are North.
10-55 p.m.  Letters reached me tonight dated 21st Decbr. In Tamworth and Sydney from Ted & Maggie, they were directed to the No 2 General Hospital.  No letters have come from you except Joes dated the 10th Decbr. which was addressed to Fremantle, and from there sent after us.
Maggie did well in the Zoology & Botany examinations.  That is good.  I must write and congratulate her.  Ted reports all well from Tamworth.
Mrs Newmarch was in the hall today, I met her walking up the steps, she is staying at the Continental hotel in Cairo, the Colonel is stationed at Mena Camp I was talking to him today; she did not have a puppy dog with her.  I forgot to ask her where Jack is.
I have been getting our hospital into working order during the day, we took over from the men who were performing the duties here before we came, Lieut. Col Bird and others from Melbourne.
Some day again I shall write more.  Good night my dears.  God bless each of you.  Heaps of love & loads of kisses for you, & regards to Maria & my other friends.
Your affectionate FareeJohn B Nash
