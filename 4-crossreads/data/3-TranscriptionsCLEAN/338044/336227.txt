  
 Boulogne is a dirty place & typical French fishing town, all cobbled streets   Legge & I take a tram up the hill. Coming back to the hotel find Pal comfortable in bed. We have a long discussion over all our doing & sleep well 
 4th August:- Friday Sleep in until 8 am & thinking it later, do things in a hurry. Breakfast at the hotel & a few of us go for a tram ride to the beach. Here are many Bathing-boxes   a good many girls are bathing, but the beach is not very good. Return to town & pack up our traps, get to the station &  secure kits. Our bill for the hotel  7 francs 50 centimes for room  & breakfast each. A French soldier, who is on leave but now returning to Verdun is pleased to find me speaking French & we have a regular great chat. At last we leave him & a great deal of waiting around the station until about 2 pm. A canteen is here but of a very second rate. A cup of tea (or rather a basin) a few buns & sandwiches suffices for lunch & we take in a stock of ginger-beer
