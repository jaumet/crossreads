 Mon 15th Was hauled out of bed at 3.15 this morning stables at 3.30 & had breakfast & was out on parade at 4.30;  The morning was slightly chilly about sunrise; but it was lovely riding, we gave our horses a feed & had a bit of a "snack" ourselves soon after sunrise;  soon after we left camp Dowling's horse put his feet in a hole & Dowling took a hand-spring off the pommel of the saddle but picked a soft spot to fall & did not get hurt;  We had a sham fight with the New Zealanders & returned to camp at 12
