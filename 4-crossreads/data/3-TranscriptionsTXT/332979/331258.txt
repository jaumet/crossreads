Before concluding my visit in Capetown I would like to mention that on my visits to the Botanical gardens I it was very amusing seeing the South African Squirrells running about the Grass & up the Trees there seem to be a large number of them, they appear to be very tame & sit on the Limbs of the Trees while you pass.
