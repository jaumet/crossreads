truly this is some train.
18th. Left Abbeville at 3 oclock this morning after a weary wait we done this part of our journey in trucks & fairly crowded at that. Arrived at Etaps at 5 o'clock & had to walk 1 1/2 miles to our camp & we were all very glad when we reached our destination. We were 36 hours doing 90 or 100 miles what do you think of that. I made enquiries here for Len & found that he was down in the Convalescent part of the joint, so after having a wash I went down & hunted him up. I soon found him, he looks alright after his illness
