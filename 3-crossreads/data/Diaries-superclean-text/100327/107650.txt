On half rations of water today owing to rough weather. Also back to bully beef and army biscuit. Round back of hill and via Dressing station to our store. Much struck by the altered appearance of the place since we came here ? good graded roads and the whole place cleared and terraced. Saw padre at Store, much overworked as he has to prepare 9 men for confirmation
A heavy billet ? the padre's Indian mule drivers jabbering away, they are from the mountain district in north of India and are decidedly Mongolian in countenance. Good little workers they are too. Taube aeroplane up aloft circling round. Parcel of mouth organs came from England some gifts cigarettes are advised from Lady Hamilton's fund Mudros. G O C sent back by Ambulance as fit for duty once more. Major Williams APM had a talk about courtmartials, very interesting as he has a waggish twin Capt Bridges, son of late G.O.C. ? decent fellow. Sprayers at work with disinfectant so engineering work can be carried on where corpses uncovered. Major Swift messes alone today. 
Went to bed early and lay for a while just listening to the rattle of the rifles just in front and the deep dull boom of exploding bombs. The rattle of machine guns, ours a dull low sound theirs staccato sharp and all the time enemy bullets pit ? a ? pat into the sandbags just overhead ? an occasional richochet shrieking off through the air like a lost soul What an insane business this is
