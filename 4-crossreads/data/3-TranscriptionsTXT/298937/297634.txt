camp at Anzac.5th Div. (Sgt Derbyshire's - late of 1st A.G.H.) have taken over hospital, but I fancy it will not be for long, as we are leaving the boat at Marseilles.We may go overland to England or just stay in France.Am getting rather excited at the prospect of seeing Dad & Lily soon.  Not nearly as excited as the occasion warrants however;  my capacity is much smaller now.Leaving Egypt I feel that my stay on there has not been at all to my benefit.
