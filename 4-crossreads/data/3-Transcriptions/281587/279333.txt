<p>a move on, and we had to wait for them, and then after travelling about a mile, we <strike>had to wait another</strike> received orders to wait and allow the Brigade Transport to pass, which took another hour.  Twelve o'clock was blown on the Rishon le Sion wine cellars whistle before we finally got a move on.</p>
<p>Such is the glorious uncertainty of Military movements.  At twenty past two by the clock <strike>on the great</strike> on the tower of the Great Hospice of St. Josheph [Joseph] of Arimathea in Ramleh, where during the siege of Jaffa, Napoleon and his staff lodged in 1799, and the Church was changed into a Hospital, now it has become a H.Q. for us and also a hospital for our boys, we were passing the front entrance of that place, with the celebrated Tower of the forty Martyrs on our right, behind us the stately ruins of Cour de Leon's Church, on our left the Great Church, <strike>dedicated I think to St George</strike> and all around us the immense olive gardens surrounding Ramleh.

In addition to the transformation effected by the hand of man, the new rains have <strike>transformed</strike> changed the country surrounding the town into veritable garden of green fields and blossoming fruit trees.</p>
<p>6th March. I feel nearly too tired to do any writing at all to-night, and only the knowledge that I will get very much behind unless I keep up day by day, spurs me up to it.  We were on the way by about 8 AM. <strike>this morning</strike>, and have only just settled down for the night.  It is now about 8 P.M.  All day we have travelled along the main road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, passing out of Ramleh by the main road along the side of the Mussulman Cemetry.  Many villages</p>
