<p>Tuesday 9 March 1915</p>
<p>The work set down for to-day was kit inspection in the morning and inspection of the Battalion by the Brigadier in the afternoon.  Kit inspection was the usual thing &ndash; a man's deficiencies in accoutrements, clothing etc. are taken for the hundredth time but you never hear any more about the carefully complied lists that are handed into the quartermaster's store.  A half-day wasted, at the minimum of 6/- a day!</p>
<p>This afternoon, however, was more profitable.  The battalion, in full marching order, moved off to a suitable parade ground and the inspection of the 13th &amp; 14th Battalions was commenced.  At the conclusion of the proceedings the parade formed a hollow square and the Brigadier addressed the troops.  After expressing his satisfaction and pleasure at the smart turn-out, and also his praise for the manner in which our work in Egypt had been carried out, he went on to deal with our future movements.  And in this Colonel Monash was very cautious and tactful (his barrister's training doubtless serving him in good stead).  Then he concluded:  "Your high standard of efficiency has secured its reward &ndash; you will be under fire within very few weeks from now.  See [?] to it that you cheerfully perform the job which you have undertaken."</p>
