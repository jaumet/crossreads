  8th Oct  Very wet miserable day. The ground is frightfully sloppy. I visited Ypres today &amp; saw Lts Nugent &amp; D&#39;Arcy-Irvine near Lille Gate. Had pleasant afternoon tea with them and invited them to tea with me tomorrow evening. I arranged with 1st Bn. Pioneers to allow their men (Nugent &amp; Irvine) as well as my own to have a hot shower bath tomorrow afternoon. Got wet through coming home. Have just issued rum ration &amp; am going to bed to read &quot;Bulletin&quot; of 12 July before going to sleep. Tremendous cannonading on up north all last night &amp; this morning. Met Sid Lloyd (57th Bn) in Ypres going into the line. 
 Requisitioned extra socks &amp; some new boots for my men on account of wet weather &amp; heavy wear.
