Here's a naval song - roared by the mess -
'Pass around the grog my boys & never mind the score''For when your money is all done we'll go to sea for more' -'Here's to him who'll never merry merry be''And will not taste of joy -Sing - sing - Ye jolly sailors (ye silly blighters) - Sing -God - Save - the - King
Well Xmas eve was a roaring one on HMAS Fantome & the grog went round & down I can tell you - I kept all right - for I always think of the future & besides I am in charge of a good deal -Its 10 am Xmas Day - There's to be a grand native festival ashore - I saw the pigs being roasted on hot stoves by the natives - I don't know whether we'll get ashore again - I want to get this thro to you if I can - That's my main point this Xmas day - I'll drink your sweet self & the children - Don't worry - I'll take every chance to communicate -
