you anything about the show as you will be able to read about it in the papers, but last night we went out to the White City and if we didn't have a roaring time I can tell you soldiers are just the thing down here. You will read in yesterdays paper where the 17th, 18th,19th Battalion are going to Parade through Sydney on the 17th so our time is drawing close and we expect to be on the water before the end of this month is out so if we do we will have a fine trip before we go on the battle field but we are all keen on getting the Kaisers whiskers.We will be getting our final leave shortly but I think we will only get 3 day so that won't give us time to go home, so if I don't go home I may go to Lockhart and spend a night but if I can I will try and get them to give me 7 days and I will send you a wire and you could see us a Gunbar or Hillston as it will be sometime I expect
