on Gun platform astern (no Gun) where can sunbake tous les jours                                                                  29/ Pay Day. 10/-  We have become the little floating monte carlo. 2 up. Crown & Anchor, Banker, Poker, over & under, etc. Some little ship, believe me.                  Have been writing letters,  picking the little hook or the Di and sunbaking - mainly the latter                                  The sea continues like going to Manly on a fine day & there's little to do but sleep & dream or wake & think  Some of this crowd are mere cattle. Have all men got souls really or is it just a fable to keep the animal tame. A few days on a transport explains any old atrocity
