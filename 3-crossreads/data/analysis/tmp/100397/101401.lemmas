 when out on a march . I can onli give you a poor descript of the place Peopl . Lack of Build space seem to be one troubl , here or els it is that these peopl are far more sociabl than the major for the hous if they can be call by the name , are huddl togeth , or rather built togeth and roof with all sort of rubbish . The place is about as clean as a bad kept Piggeri and the peopl themselv , are if anyth wors than pig . There are a few that seem to tri and keep themselv decent , but the major , are absolut stranger to soap and water . When you write again be sure and note the chang of address ? I have not been issu with new number yet , so will still use the old one . Give my Love to all friend Relat , when you see them . much for yourself Bet from your love son Chas G.
