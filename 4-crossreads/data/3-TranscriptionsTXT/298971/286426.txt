moving British Troops coming out of action made our progress along the roads very slow.  German Prisoners.  Everything living creature is covered in mud.  Guns booming from all directions.  We gradually made our way round the hills along these muddy roads, over trenches & shell holes to a spot on the northern side of Mametz woods.  Lucky to get in with Tommies and sleep for the night in a floored hut.  18" gun on the railway line.  Numbers of others on different branches of the railway now being pushed forward.
