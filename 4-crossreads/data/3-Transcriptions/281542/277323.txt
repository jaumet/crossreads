<p>Friday 9th July 1915</p>
<p>A hot oppressive day &ndash; "full marching orders" parade.  The atmosphere is thick &amp; muggy, &amp; the troops perspire freely &amp; curse the stifling heat.  As we approach the equator each day, warmer conditions prevail.  Discarded cardigan jacket for the first time &ndash; others throwing off thick underwear.  Rush for saloon &amp; boat decks at night.  The dull routine of ship life is unbearable &ndash; my restless nature craves for greater activity &amp; change of purview.  Nothing to see from day to day beyond the limitless expanse of the ocean &ndash; not a ship sighted for over a week.</p>
<p>Saturday 10th July 1915</p>
<p>Another hot day, calm sea &ndash; awnings necessary on well &amp; boat decks.  Boxing contest B Co. afternoon.  Col. Lamrock &amp; other officers present.  Some good stoush, with a minimum of skill.  One clean knock-out.  Despite the uneventful voyage with its monotonous daily life, the troops display a remarkable buoyancy of spirits.  Whether they realize the seriousness of the work before them in a few weeks, they do not show it by their attitude on board.  One would think they were on a huge picnic or harbour excursion &ndash; their happy disposition speaks volumes for their heroic self-sacrifice for the great cause.</p>
