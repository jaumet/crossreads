May

since we lefty Liverpool. It has been blowing hard all day and is very uncomfortable on deck although the wind is not cold or the sea rough.

It is very hard to secure a sheltered spot on deck to sit and read in, owing chiefly to the smallness of the ship for the large number of troops that are on her.

The weather continued to be nice and warm for the rest of the journey to Port-Said. We arrived at Port-Said on the afternoon of Thursday the 15th and anchored inside the harbour. As we entered the harbour we saw four French warships and one English, which were anchored just inside the entrance. They are a very old class of ship.

We are not allowed to go ashore here, so I cannot say what the port is like, But what I can see of the town from the water
