<p>about.  Apparently someone has been fortunate enough to find a key to fit my bag.<br/>About 100 men slightly poisoned through eating cooked apple drawn for dinner from troops galley.  All received medical attention during afternoon.  Getting fairly well known on board through being continually on duty at the dispensary.  Very heavy wind &amp; rain storm at night.</p>
<p>Thursday 2/12/15<br/>Fairly strong wind blowing though sea fairly calm.  Getting very tired of ship's food, cannot enjoy meals at all lately, will be glad to get on shore to have a good meal.  Canteen stores getting very low, unable to buy any tinned fruits or biscuits at all.</p>
