Nothing much doing all day - Auction Bridge at intervals - Some animated discussion on my Sick Bay & Sick mess - I have to do a good deal of battle for them - Service Routine is always being dinned into my ears - Damn S R say I when it conflicts with common sense - If S R were a Divine institution & revelation I'd give in but as I see many defects & much foolish crass conservatism I reckon it's human & as such I mean to criticize what I understand - freely - I mean to have my sick - well fed well messed - well looked after - That's my pidgin & to that end - I inspect - talk to cook - keep J on the run - My sick are comfortable & say so
