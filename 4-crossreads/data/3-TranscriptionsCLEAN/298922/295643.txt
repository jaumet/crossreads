Malta still, I don't mind as we are able to see so much of interest here.
Four of us went to a "Maltese" Hotel & had a Fish & Spaghetti dinner. Malta is a cheap place to live in. Cold & rough weather, we are glad to be going to Egypt & wish Laura would come. Parties have been digging up Flint arrow heads among the Tombs, Phoenicians, Greeks, ROMANS, ARABS, all had their day. I wonder if this is England's swan song.
