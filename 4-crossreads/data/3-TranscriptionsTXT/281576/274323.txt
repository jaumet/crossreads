On the Day on which Peace is declared &ndash; Last verse
Now we'll all join together &amp; sing the last verse,The first part of our Programme is endedIf we've given you a prod we didn't mean worseAnd we hope there  is no one offendedSo cheer up, be merry, for tomorrow we dieAll the Anzacs are leaving the Somme bye &amp; bye
On the day on which Peace is declaredWe might have been worse had we daredFarewell to our dugouts, the whizzbang &amp; dudFarewell to rum Issues, shell holes &amp; the mudWe'd like to come back to the Somme if we couldOn the day on which Peace is declared.
Well I had some words of a different kindO! isn't that singularAnd it's strange that I haven't gone out of my mind.O isn't that singular.Nancy pushed Lille down Estaires it appearsAnd Albert called in to lesson her fearsBut the poor Girl Laon his Armentieres.O! isn't that singular?Yes very peculiar
Well theres one good may come of America's actionO isn't that etcApart from driving old Fritz to distractionO wont that be singular.Privates in the Army will be so very rareThere'll be nothing but stars &amp; stripes in the AirIf they ask for a star, why they'll chuck you a pair.
