<p>Tuesday, 22nd May 1917<br/>The weather is continuing mild so that with the long days, everything is rather pleasant although somewhat tame. Yesterday I had my first swim of the season off Wimereux beach and found it pretty good. The countryside is now very pretty &ndash; everything is a mass of green. Sunny France is coming into its own!</p>
<p>Trainloads of Australian troops have been passing our place for the last couple of days, evidently all coming off the Somme and going up to the Armentieres front. Perhaps for a big push in the direction of Lille. Personne no sait.</p>
<p>The French civilians in this locality are feeling the effects of the war pretty keenly. Sugar &amp; potatoes are doled out on the presentation of cards and flour is so scarce that bread cannot be obtained some days. The army rations has been reduced but supplies still appear to be fairly plentiful.</p>
