 Military Camp, Liverpool 
 Address. A.A.M.C. Field Hospital, Liverpool. 25th November 1915. 
 No.2 Dearest Mother. You will be pleased to hear that I am now settled in the A.A.M.C. my transfer having gone through satisfactorily yesterday. On Tuesday last I was sent down to Liverpool in charge of a Corporal to be transferred in accordance with a notification received by our O.C. from Major Lawes. We left Casula at about 9 O'clock in the morning, and before going I bade a fond farewell to all my friends but by that night to their surprise I was back again in Casula. The Corporal sent with me was a real dunderhead and had omitted to bring my papers down with him. We spent the whole day tramping from one office to another in Liverpool Camp and finally had to return without accomplishing anything. On Wednesday I returned to Liverpool with another Corporal and between us we managed to fix things up satisfactorily and I was duly installed in my new quarters. I sleep in a large tin hut with about thirty others. The huts are well ventilated and scrubbed out daily. The chief difference between this Cors and the infantry is the fact that here one's things are much safer and have not to be locked up whenever one leaves them. Also there is not the same brisk military air about things, and not half the work to be done. All the high Officers, Captains &amp;c. are doctors and they lack the briskness of the true Military man. At present I am on "General Duties" and for the last two days have been loading timber - six of us in all under the charge of the "Pioneer" Sergeant. It is very easy work compared to all day
