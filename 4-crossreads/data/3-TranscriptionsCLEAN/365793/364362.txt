The fc'stle head is a regular "flapper", clothing of all sorts & sizes hung out to dry, and there are even blankets, & a pair of leggings. - There was a  farcical  hammock inspection at 2 oclock. In a great many case the Sgts didn't even see our hammocks - let alone say how many blankets they contained. Six devil dodgers we have on board & not a damn one of them
