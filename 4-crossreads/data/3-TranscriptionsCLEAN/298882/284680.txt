  
 We had had a gas alarm previous to this so that by the time the shell burst and left us in darkness  and  smoke and dust everybody had the "wind up" pretty badly.  All night and all day today the enemy has shelled our pill box incessantly  and  with the result that all heads are aching a treat but otherwise OK.  A more hellish time I have never experienced.
