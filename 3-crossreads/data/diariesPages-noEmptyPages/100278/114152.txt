There are some lovely buildings there. The Palace of Justice is one she is a very fine building but the principal one is of course the magnificient Catherdal. By Jove she is a beauty but very very old supposed to have been built by the Germans I don't know how many years ago, there is a lot of Gothic archieteture in her and it is well worth a visit the sculpturing and carving are very fine and the best of it is all sandbagged up to protect it in case she should be bombed at any time, there are bonzer statues and engravings all over her outside as well as in, but what took my eye most was the beautiful and lovely tints of the stained glass windows they are splendid and such a size.
