<p>CHAPTER XXX1X.</p>
<p><u>ENGLAND - ON DUTY</u>.</p>
<p>I fairly opened the valve of enjoyment to it&#39;s fullest extent while in Brussels, and I can quite understand how it is so many of our people in England go to the Continent for a change.&nbsp; They certainly do not go there for a rest, change, ye gods! yes, and plenty of it too.</p>
<p>Day and night there is plenty to be seen and plenty to do.&nbsp; The customs of the people are so very different from our own, but it does not take very long for you to get into their ways.&nbsp; It was an education to me as it has proved to many others too no doubt.&nbsp; Reading about these places is useless, one wants to see them and the life generally to appreciate it.</p>
<p>While in Dinant the residents were very excited one day owing to the expected arrival of their king.&nbsp; Early in the afternoon he arrived without any pomp or ceremony, walking amongst the people and talking to the children.&nbsp; He spent a long time looking at the walls where so many of his subjects had been slaughtered and removed his hat when viewing their graves.&nbsp; Exceptionally tall and big, with a heart of a dozen, he apparently enjoys the love, devotion and unanimous respect of all classes of his kingdom.</p>
<p>I bid farewell to my boss who is returning to Dinant.&nbsp; He has not only been my boss, but a very good friend&nbsp;too, and the parting is with genuine regret.&nbsp; During the afternoon of the ame [same?] day, I also bid farewell to the glorious city of Brussels where I have had such a wonderful couple of days.</p>
<p>At about 4.30 p.m. on the 6th. February. &#39; 19 I leave the city on my way to Calais.&nbsp; Sleep one night at a small village where the train rests for the night.&nbsp; Some difficulty in obtaining a room in the place, but eventually am accommodated in an attic which is none too inviting, but as no one was allowed to remain in the train, a shelter of some kind was necessary so made the best of my domicile.</p>
<p>Was awakened in time to have a jolly good breakfast and catch the train which was timed to leave at about 6.a.m.</p>
