<p>I stripped off &amp; had a good wash &amp; then went down stairs for my dinner this is a good place to live nobody seems to be rationed the bread is white butter plentiful also meat, in fact you would never know there was a war on &amp; its the same in the town &amp; she's crowded to some order visitors being here from all parts some place believe me, the streets which lie at the back of the promenade are funny little winding affairs, but you can get almost anything you want, even here there are 2 Australians beside myself no matter where you go you will find some of our chaps<br/>10th.
