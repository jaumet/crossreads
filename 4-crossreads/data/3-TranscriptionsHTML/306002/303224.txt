<p>10.7.15<br/>Sat. 10th.  Indian meal for breakfast again this morning &amp; it is very good, had rice for dinner (quite a luxury).  Les came down shortly after dinner &amp; has to go on again at 9 oclock tonight, put the afternoon in practising signalling &amp; about 3 oclock the Lord Nelson <strike>&amp; Warspite</strike> came on the scene opposite us &amp; opened fire with heavy guns &amp; appeared to be dropping them on a hill this side of Achi Baba.  Had a good feed of rice for tea &amp; then went to the beach for a swim the water was rather chilly tonight also last night, but well worth the trip.  The days are getting hotter here &amp; it is no trouble to work up a good perspiration.</p>
