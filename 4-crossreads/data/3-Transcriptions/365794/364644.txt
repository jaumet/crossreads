<p>Friday 31 [30] August 1917 [1918]<br/>Met Mr. Wanden 4.30 p.m. &amp; tea Groppi's.  As usual Groppi's is full, mostly Australians &amp; the "kangaroo feathers" wave as gaily there as maybe on the battle field.  One certainly finds out the best in each one of us over here &amp; we meet in such a friendly spirit.  Walk round Cairo a little &amp; then photos at Nubry's [?] &amp; so back per Mauchette [?] tram &amp; on duty once more.<br/>Stories one hears &ndash;<br/>Hundreds of our boys up the line, 2 up in 'plane which catches fire, when 1500 ft. up, one boy jumps &ndash; seen shot to pieces &ndash; other burnt to death before their eyes &amp; all unable to help, the hardest sight of all these men say.</p>
