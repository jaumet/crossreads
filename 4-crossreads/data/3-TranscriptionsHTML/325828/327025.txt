<p>I am thinking of sending a birthday cable for yours &amp; Mother's birthdays (3rd &amp; 9th March) &amp; also advising you to address <strike>any</strike>  my letters to Australian Base Post Office London.  As my movements are very indefinite I will advise the A.B.P.O. of my address from time to time.  It is possible I may be here for a further 3 months, or again I may be in France in a fortnight's time.<br/>It is getting on towards bed-time so must close.  The Ausy mail closes on Tuesday (20th) I believe &amp; I am hoping this will go by that boat.<br/>With much love to you all at "Cairnleith,"<br/>I am,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
