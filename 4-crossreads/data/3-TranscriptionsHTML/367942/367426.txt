<p>frightful &amp; most unsanitary. The proper name of the camp we don't know but I believe it is not Fuchsberg.<br/>23rd April<br/>We are still waiting arrival of the Kommandant, two officers have arrived but they know nothing or say they don't.<br/>30th April<br/>7A.M. Marched out of Nethermore to station raining &amp; blowing. Noon Had a meal at Hanover. 10pm. Arrived at Clausthal Camp starting to snow &amp; bitterly cold. Officers had an excellent meal awaiting us, first since leaving Heidelberg.<br/>Clausthal was in pre-war times The Peacock Hydro, the rooms in the main building are fine but of course we were put in the huts, six in a room, not bad, but bitterly cold &amp; no fires.<br/>1st May<br/>Woke up to find everything covered with snow, which gradually melted during the day. This place is right up in the Hertz Mountains about 2500 feet high &amp; most of the time covered with mist. The outlook when clear is beautiful. The camp overlooks a lake with hills &amp; woods beyond, making a pretty picture.</p>
