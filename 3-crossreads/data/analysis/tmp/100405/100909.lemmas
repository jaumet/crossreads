 "Skindl 's " in Poperingh ( The Salient , 1917 ) ( Reprint from the London Mercuri ) Reveill April 1 , 1942 Shut the door , Jameson , shut the blast door - The whole road 's block as far as Elverdingh . Four Bridg would hold you up an hour or more So do n't go crash up to-night , old thing - What weather ! Hall-mark Flander wind and rain ! Come on insid . My groom will take your mare Round to the smithi on the Market Squar . Let 's have a dekko at the cart again . It 's a posh lunch to-day , Suzann 's a vision , And the room 's lousi with the old Divis . Just now MacMartin stop me on the street With news from Amien . ( And Marguerit Send you her love . Oh , it 's a bonzer war In cushi billet at the Poisson D?Or ! ) Mac is the same old swinger ? he "mistook " His indic rout , and lost his bunch , Jump on a tender down from Hazebrouck And blew in here with Willi Braid for lunch . They re in the bar with Tupper , back from Blighti , Cap his yarn of Bath and Aphrodit . Yes ? I go back at dawn . We re on the ridg Over the Steenbeek by the corduroy bridg , Past the big pill-box with the doubl cleft To the main rout stump on the sky-lin ? then half-left It 's about an hour from the lorry-stand , unless You take the duck-board near the R.E. shaft . Quicker that way , of cours , but bad strafe . You ll see a strand tank there ? that 's the Mess . What is it like now ? Smelli , Jim , and muddi - Under restraint , I call it fair bloodi . Noth like Nieuport . Whi , it seem an age - And yet the year is bare four month older , Sinc we got round up on the narrow-gaug And visit Belgian outpost in the polder . That was the life , old Jimmi ! Now it 's a black And gori busi , slog away by pack - Most of it salvag ? while the five-nin crump Our half-drown hairi stagger from the dump . ( Well , here 's luck , Jim ! Gone dri ? Whi , I?d forgotten - Another brand , Suzann ! This sweet stuff 's rotten . ) There 's a new mob to-night about the town - The whole back area 's stiff with gun and troop , And Proven road chock-ful with "heavi group " From six-inch up . They ve put the tape-lin down And move the forward dump to Poelcappell . Battle-headquart ? somewher near the Bower , All day and night we re brass off like hell - It 's go to be a " Brock 's " at zero hour ! The Hun 's not loaf though he 's get windi , Listen ! Even from here you can hear the shindi . Two night ago we caught it hell-for-leath . The new relief had just gone on ahead , Leav the alter signal "green-over-r . " There was a littl mist , and some soft weather - All quiet at nine o'clock . Hard a sound . I took my gum-boot for a last look round . Noth was do besid the usual crack Of long-rang shrapnel on the duckboard track , And a croon eight-inch , hump along a load Meant for the side on the Pilkem road . Cluster of Verey light along the line Flicker and plung . They help my eye to mark Our barrage-lin across the battery-arc . The pool were hoar with silver in the shine . Peac it was . I stroll and smoke and stare - There came a quicken rumbl in the East , Down the battalion front the light increas . Machin gun rave and stutter . A rocket flare - Scarlet and golden-rain spout and spread , Flare and skysign and star , and Green-over-r ! Watch for it Sentri ! There again . Yes ! Battery-Act ! S.O.S. Shadowi man after man leap to a gun . Flash from the centr ? five then flash as one . All round are flash , light the livid face of strain gun-crew . Vicious and vivid Fire spiral and cataract ? knive , spike Of fire stab the dark . Batter and strike On the ear the unutter , profound Debaucheri of sound - The roar and clutter and whinni ? sustain , obscen As if the dead beast of the Pleistocen , Spawn of the essenc Of ravag earth 's womb and her churn putresc Were howl over the mud their lust unclean . They ? well , when everi hollow 's a belch mass Of wrangl gun , gun bellow to gun - You cannot tell a burst of our from the Hun 's - Sudden through the cordit I smelt the gas . Down went the warn through the roar and screech - The spit splinter plough us like a squall , Half-blind gunner wrestl with the breech , Gas-helmet , smoke-drench ? you know it all - Then the five-nin began . A Salvo came , And Number Four went up in a gust of flame . I thought the whole of the line was smash and finish - And then , through the reek of the fog and the drop mire , From the right flank , steadi and undiminish , Came the assur crash of section-f , Time and check and re-laid . We grope and plung To pull the stricken out . Still drone the steadi Voic of the sergeant at the " set and readi " . Number One , fire ! The muzzl flame and lung . Number Two , fire ! By God , those chap are stunner ! Search Franc , you ll find no better than my gunner . But some good men went West ? some of the best . Hors or men , the best must alway go - Jim , it 's a mad , blind , lunat , filthi show - Destini 's pitch-and-toss made manifest . I 'm sick to death of it . And yet ? and yet Noth in life , I suppos , lack credit and debt - There 's a hold somehow in this craze eclips Of the normal orient ? a hold that grip - The batter brain may hanker for surceas , But under the brain ? it 's curious ? there is peac . Hold on a bit . Last leav I met a fellow Who corner me at the club and hiccup crude Optimist zeal and tub-worn platitud - You know the sort . Slug-belli , slushi , mellow . He wink , and wag his tubbi hand , and spout - " Break through next time , old boy ! " He knew , he knew - The final trap was laid ? the Hun was out - He?d had it straight from Jone at G.H.Q . ? And ? " Then we ll see you sportsmen back at Dover Cover with glori ? sorri it 's all over . "
