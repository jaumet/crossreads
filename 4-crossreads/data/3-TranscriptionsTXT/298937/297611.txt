Squeezed my finger a day or two ago & doctor took off the nail;  it is now doing well.Met Harold Clarence in the N.Z. Canteen two nights ago.He has not been away from here since landing 3 months ago.His brother is a Serakim [?] a few miles desert wards from here.It was very pleasant to spend a few hours with the man who was a good friend to me in the stormy days of Whiporie.We had an evening at a scratch Cinema show that has been erected here.
