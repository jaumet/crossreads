<p>shut up in the miserable apology for an office all day &amp; most nights is enough to damp one's spirits. Hope I soon get to the front where one is credited for any work he does, if even less than here. Work until 5.30 pm    &amp; after dinner go to the Cinema&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    , which is rather good. Having missed the last tram home, take a brisk walk of half an hour &amp; arrive at 11-10 pm    Cinema price, first class seats 1franc for soldiers and 11/2 f. for civilians</p>
<p>20th August:- Sunday<br/>Being tired, did not wake this morning until 8 am, too late for Church &amp; got off to work: 9am  The casualties show no signs of decreasing &amp; we put through until 12-30, nearly 300 for 2nd Division   A nice hot dinner, well prepared in English style, awaits us, at our new found English lady's place    &amp; I  very much appreciate it, as the weather is rather cool &amp; looks</p>
