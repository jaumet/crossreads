Sun 21stFell in for Church Parade at 9.30 this morning & enjoyed a very good sermon;  Writing all the afternoon & decided to take a stroll to Heliopolis after tea with Fletcher & made our way to Luna Park & experimented with skates.  I did not shape too bad considering it was the first time I've had them on for 4 years  We arrived back in camp at 8.30;  Fletcher had to be back to feed up at 9 oclock
