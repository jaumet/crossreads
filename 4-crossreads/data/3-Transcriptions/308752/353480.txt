<p>for France. We arrived at Folkstone at 10 a.m. &amp; had to wait about till 3.30 p.m. before the boat started off.  Packed like sardines on board, &amp; naturally every one is in a bad humour, we all know this country of France now. We eventually arrived at Boulogne at 8 p.m., experienced another long march to the Rest Camp. Marched back again to the station at 10 p.m. train left about midnight, arrived back again with my Unit at 10 oclock the following morning.</p>
<p>So after nearly two years active service I have had my leave trip at last. It was the most enjoyable &amp; glorious trip that I have ever had in my life. I always had an ambition to see England, now of course I am satisfied. London is really a wonderful city, it exceeded all my expectations. During my travels I saw some of the sights of the world, &amp; I often stopped at the very best places I could find in the different cities I visited, except when with relations. I met kindness where ever I went, especially the latter. The Australian Soldier is some swank in England "believe me". The trip cost &pound;18 &amp; I don't grudge a penny of it, after living like a pig for nearly 2 years you can imagine what it was like to have every comfort again. I must have spent about &pound;5 in gifts which I sent to my numerous friends in Australia.</p>
<p>Father don't forget &amp; write to your sisters &amp; thank them for their great kindness to me.<br/>Fond love, from Langford</p>
