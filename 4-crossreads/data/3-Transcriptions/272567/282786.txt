<p>25/11/18 Bohain<br/>After lunch walked down to where the Brigade starting point is to be tomorrow. A foggy day and mud and slush everywhere. Passing motor lorries splashed mud over everyone. The local Hotel de Ville has been burnt down by the Huns. Streets crowded with all kinds of troops. A cinema show close to Bde HQ was crowded out and a large number of men were waiting in queue out in the street. Went down to the 24th and saw Selleck and then to the 22nd and had a talk to all of them up there &ndash; a good lot of chaps. Jack came along to mess and spent the evening with me. Brown &amp; Hislop have had a very busy day engaged on details covering rations and finding billets for the Brigade group tomorrow. A mine blew up the railway near Cambrai.</p>
