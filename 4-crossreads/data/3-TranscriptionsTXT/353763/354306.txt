The Fijian physique is a very fine one  -  Their big mops of frizzled hair & their brown skins & their laughy jolly natures attract one very much  -  They have bad qualities - very cowardly I am informed - treacherous when they can do it - with impunity to their own skins - untidy unclean & destitute of thrift & progress  -  Their customs before we took charge were brutal in the extreme  -  There's such a lot of brown, black, yellow people here that I counted up one day how many whites & how many other colored people wd  pass me in a given time  -  Anything between 20  - 30 dark men to 1 white was the ratio - fairly correct I fancy  -
I saw also some good tennis - top of the second class is about the best here
The green sward of the cricket & tennis lawns looks very well in the foreground of a picture whose middle & back ground are terraced houses & villas with terra cotta roofs & a numerous medly of Mango, Palm & Chestnut & other foliage all growing in the gardens & on the slopes & setting off the houses strike>with by this green galaxy of vegetation  -
