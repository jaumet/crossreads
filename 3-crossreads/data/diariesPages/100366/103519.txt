 
shell fire the whole time, but one can only live and hope.

18.8.16 Friday.

It rained again today and made the roads exceptionally hard for our work, which takes us over very difficult country. One of our horses dropped dead at Acheux and we had to put a riding horse in its place to draw the vehicle, afterwards sending a party back to bury him.

There is a heavy bombardment proceeding on our left sector in the region of Thiepval This place is a thorn in the side of the advance and is holding it up, and same being a wonderfully strong fortified position is going to cause some trouble.

Our sleeping Lizzie has again been severely strafing the Germans again and of course we have been getting a few returns.

The Aeroplanes are again very active and this coupled with the Bombardment which has just started is probably the start of a renewed attack. I understand that they have driven an immense mine lead right under Thiepval and we all expect it to go up in the air in a few days time. Cavalry is again active and if they can only break through there will be some fun on the Somme front
