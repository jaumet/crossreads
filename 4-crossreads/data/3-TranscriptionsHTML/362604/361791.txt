<p>10.11.18<br/>One Blanket Hill<br/>France</p>
<p>Dear Dad, Mother &amp; George,</p>
<p>We arrived here at noon yesterday.  Leaving Fovant at 6.30 p.m. we arrived without incident after a pretty cool trip at our Port at 3 a.m.  We talked &amp; yarned &amp; supped until 5 a.m. &amp; then gradually dropped off to sleep.  (One) feather beds are pretty hard nevertheless we slept well for a couple of Hours &amp; left our Port at 10 a.m.  We went down the Town after Tea &amp; had a good meal of steak&amp; eggs, with lovely grapes as dessert.  The place is very old &amp; very dirty in the part that we visited.  We were glad to walk up the Hill Home again away from the numerous nasty smells.  I noticed that there is no water laid on.  Jack &amp; Jill have to fetch their water, the Taps</p>
