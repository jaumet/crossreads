Sunday 16 May 1915
Still jogging along the same old way - nothing to do and the whole day in which to perform the difficult task.  Thank the Lord, there was no church "parade".  Certainly a few stray Chaplains turned up and went through the words with their huge bundles of Churchy literature.  At every bed they stop, and with apparently a great effort, manage to get out the words:  "Have a tract?" in precisely the same tone as one would say "Have an orange?"  Spiritual food is what they call their wowseristic productions, I expect.
