Had an awfully busy day. Packed up this morning also had a Kit inspection and an address by General Christian on our conduct in France. Packing up most of the day but managed to get down for my last swim in Lake Timsah during the afternoon. We leave at 11.50 tonight Some of them have gone already We left Camp about 10.30 and left Moasca about 11.30 p.m.

Had a very uncomfortable and crowded trip in a cattle tuck. Reached Alexandria about 8 a.m. and embarked almost immediately on "Tunision" About 2800 troops on board very crowded so I’m afraid our trip won’t be too pleasant. Had a cup of tea and some iced coffee and cake at Y.W.C.A. on wharf. We drew away from the wharf and anchored out in the Bay for the night Very crowded on board but good food. Very hard to get sleeping positions.

Got under way about 8.30 a.m. Scout cruiser of "Arathusa" class escorting us. The escort is changed every few hours. There are no baths unfortunately but plenty of washing dishes. I played "eucre" most of the morning. We also fell in for "assembly" We had a medical inspection for measles this afternoon and have also been allotted boats in case of accident. The "Hororata" and Rhesus are now in sight behind us. We get any amount of bread and butter and jam. Beautiful bread

We held a Church parade this morning Our old parson is rather monotonous and always has the same sermon and hymns it seems to me. We have passed a good many boats during the day a good many of them being war boats. We passed between two Islands about midday which is supposed to be a bad place of submarines as I understand several boats have been sunk in the same locality. I wish I knew the names of the Islands for future reference. I believe we are making for Malta. Crete Island we passed.
