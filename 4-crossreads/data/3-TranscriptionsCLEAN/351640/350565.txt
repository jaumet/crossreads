  
 distant from where I sit writing.  The pyramid to the left is the Grand Pyramid (Cheops) the one to the right the Great Pyramid.  Note on the latter just below the top an irregular edge crossing each of the two surfaces, this marks the only remains of a smooth covering of alabaster, with which each is said to have been originally encased.  The ridge running from left to right intervenes between the pyramids and the camp, it is sandstone rock covered with loose sand.  Mena House was shut out of the view of the photographic plate by the left end of the elevation.  Sometimes I leave our abode & cross the hill to get to the encampment, the way is across deep sand, but from the top there is a widespread view of all the stationary troops, of the desert near and far, and of the Nile valley, of Cairo and of the ridges way to the North & East of the City, one can, on a clear day note the various suburbs & the principal features of the buildings and landscape along the sweep of the Nile.  Midst the green of the lucern & such like low growing crops, the date palms rise loftily and form a forest, which maps out the areas near the river where their roots can be midst the moisture all the year round and their heads for most of it in the blazing sun, thus fulfilling their requirements which are - "feet in a swamp, head in a furnace" -.  The infantry, artillery, engineers, and medical corps, occupy the various sections of tentage, making a goodly show, ready to meet the Turks here or preparing to try a fall with those fighting in Europe. 
 The small picture is a section out of the one above designed to exhibit the red ensign - the "Union Jack" on a red ground - floating above the troops.  I cannot pick out the officers personally, though one better acquainted should easily recognise the fat man on the horse to the right.  The sides of the pyramids in view are the North & West.
