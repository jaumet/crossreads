<p>to be with them again. As far as I know this 3rd A.C.C.S. has not opened since we were bombed   &amp;  shelled. the Staff are lent around at British C.C. Stations   &amp;  some of them are not very happy,</p>
<p>five nurses left here yesterday-morn for C.C.S. work, unfortunately for me, my little Staff nurse, who is a great favourite with patients   &amp;  an excellent worker. I miss her very much. To my surprise a British Sister was sent to help me &ndash; so we have four helping in our hospital. It is strange how they are mixing us. Anyhow she is a jolly nice girl   &amp;  is very happy here &ndash; hopes she will be allowed to remain.</p>
