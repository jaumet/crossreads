 P.S. I received George's letter with the two newspaper cuttings in it.  I received his letter saying that Cyril had left Australia at 11 A.M. &amp; at 12.30 p.m. Mr Dean handed Ellis the not saying that he was at the Camp about a mile from us. Hope you are all well as we are.  None of us have been sick yet amongst our mates.  Two or three have had colds &amp; they have been sent to the Big Hospital.  Cyril has seen Clarrie Creighton &amp; Keith Little but so far I have not seen him. Harry
