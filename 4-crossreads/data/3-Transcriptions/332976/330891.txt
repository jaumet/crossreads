<p>July 1917<br/>of heavy bridge calculated to carry 12 tons with safety.<br/>In the afternoon we <strike>had</strike> played <strike>a holiday</strike> the 14th F.C. football (Australian Rules) but unfortunately lost.   At about 1 PM to-day the 5th Div. Pioneer Battalion came into Corbie &amp; took up their billets here, probably in order to take a course in Pontoon bridging, which I understand, General Hobbs has advised    Very heavy rain fell during the night accompanied by heavy thunder &amp; lightning.<br/>8th   Sunday   After the 9 o'clock parade this morning we were free for the rest of the day.   I had a glorious feed of cherries this afternoon.</p>
