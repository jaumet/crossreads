<p>the Navy Board will perhaps realise their crime in sending us those recovered deserters, bad hats &amp; gaol birds last September. The strain is not so much on the body, tho' that is severe enough, as on the soul. Anyhow, we shove off alright. Destination still mysterious. Turns out to be Gib as expected.<br/>Pass full rigged American barque under full sail. She looked beautiful, bowling along without apparent effort.<br/>Just before touching line, pass S. Paul islands. Never suspected such a place. W/T Station, I believe.<br/>Jan 17. Had anyone ever such a congregation as mine. First, our own sailors (from Britain, Africa, Canada &amp; Australia). Germans who are Lutherans, and negroes from Africa, professing to be American Baptists.<br/>Jan. 19. Finished this morning actual circumnavigation of the globe. Arrived S. Vincent from the west. Like greeting old friend. Cabeco de Washington still in old place. Same dirty old town, some dirty chocolate natives diving for coins &amp; never missing. Many ships, five</p>
