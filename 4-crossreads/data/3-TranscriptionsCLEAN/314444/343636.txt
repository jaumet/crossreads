Dear Mother & Father,
I wrote to you by last Friday's mail. I hope you recieve it alright. I also posted a few post cards. I am sending twenty four post cards to you by this mail I am also sending you some presents. I hope you get them alright. I have sent three dresses a couple of scarfs a table centre and a spoon. I want you to tell me if I got them reasonable. They are all hand worked & the silks are the best. I paid 30/- each for the cammel hair or tussore dresses & 25/- for the silk evening a pound each for the scarfs 12/- for the centre & 3/- for spoon. That was 7 altogether. There is a dress for mother & a scarf two dresses an evening & a summer for Dorothy also a scarf & the other two for the house. I have not seen anything suitable
