Cocoa, I managed during the Day to get two more Blankets and slept much warmer all night. Monday All day Sunday it was very Wet & miserable.Monday 28thAll the morning it was wet & miserable, but after Dinner it cleared up a little, so I went with a chum into La Havre and while awaiting the Train, along came a Motor Wagon and a lot of us scrambled into it and had a ride into the Town, both of us had to do some business first and then we strolled around for a while, but it was still wet & miserable and we kept going until after 3Pm when we went into the Crystal Palace Y.M.C.A, a fine building with two rows of Galleries, the first is where Meals are provided, at reasonable rates and the 2nd Gallery is for Writing & Reading, at one end of the first Gallery is a Picture Screen and at the other is a Machine erected on a staging and Pictures were shewn at 7 Pm. After writing two letters we both had our Tea and as it was fine, we went out for a walk until 7 Pm. La Havre is very much like all the other French towns I have seen, with it's narrow streets
