24th Saddled up and hunted for the Battalion which I found camped outside Abeele. We had gone 6 miles too far, so had to return. Raining all day! Everywhere one walked he sunk knee deep in mud. The weather is cold and bleak.
25th Raining hard. Everything is miserable. Took a stroll into Poperinghe. Very quiet.
26th Reveille at 4.30 am. Moved off at 7 am. Rain cleared off about 7.30 arrived at Hopautre Siding (Poperinghe) about 9 am and entrained. Where are we going? Everyone asks that question. About 4 pm we stopped at Calais but only for about 10 minutes. We could see the Channel and how we longed for a trip across to Civilization. So near & yet so far!! Then we passed through Bolougne. Some town but alas we did not stop there. About 9 pm we reached Abbeyville, stayed about 10 minutes then left for Saint Riquier where we arrived at 10 pm.
