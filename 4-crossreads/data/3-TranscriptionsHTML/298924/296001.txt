<p>Sunday 19 January 1919<br/>Beersheba<br/>Went Beersheba to see the graves of our men &amp; get crosses erected &ndash; it was interesting seeing all the Shellal country again.  I noticed the mosaic was reproduced in the Australasian lately.<br/>A man named Miller from Mathoura came into my Tent &amp; wanted to know how to become a "Stock Inspector"!!  He said he knew Joe &amp; had been a drover!!<br/>There are 20 1st L.H. buried in cemetery among young Gum Trees &amp; 4 miles out among 38 of the 4th &amp; 12th &amp; where my old Sergeant Major lies Paddy Lenehan.</p>
