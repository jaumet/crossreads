<p>Wednesday 4 October 1916<br/>Up at 4.15 &amp; went round the line with the General. Rain started soon after we got back &amp; continued with some breaks all the morning. Stayed in until after lunch when I again went round the line with Cuthbert. A very heavy bombardment on to our right brigade was opened up by the enemy towards evening causing us to shelter in one of the tunnels for a while.  Later we heard that the artillery strafe was followed by 2 raids, both unsuccessful.</p>
