<p>was his relief to see him sit up &ndash; one poor fellow was killed outright, all the others on the gun were wounded &ndash; a shell burst about 6 yds away from them, was'nt  it a miraculous escape for them &ndash; Willie said they got Jack on a stretcher &amp; carried him back. They did not know whether the leg was broken or not &ndash; after getting rid of Jack, Willie went back &amp; lowered the gun &amp; fired it, when some one took him away &ndash; he was wounded in the upper right arm &amp; side &ndash; he said he was sorry to go because they were "having the time of their lives" never before had they seen their shells hit their mark &ndash; he said the Germans came on in four waves, &amp; then they began to ease off before our gunners &amp; gradually they retreated.</p>
<p>The news is not very good just now &ndash; I do wish that the tide would turn in our favour, we must have patience I suppose.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to yourself &amp; Miss Ferguson &amp; many thanks for wire</p>
