<p>5.4.15<br/>Mon. 5th.  It sprung up very windy &amp; dusty during the night;  &amp; as we could see only a few yards through the dust this morning, we were told there would be no parade &amp; we were comfortably dozing in our tents at 9.30 when the "fall in" blew, so we had to bustle about &amp; get food for our horses &amp; ourselves, as we were to be out all day, but as soon as we were mounted &amp; started to move off we were lost, the dust was cruel, &amp; we were taken back on the lines at 11 oclock;  a lecture in the mess room after dinner.  The most miserable Easter Monday I have ever had.</p>
