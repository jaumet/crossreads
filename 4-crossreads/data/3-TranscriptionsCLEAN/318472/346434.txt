  
 28 July 1918 Sunday 9 After Trinity 
 An uneventful day. Church Parade in morning. Weather getting uncomfortably warm. The boat is by no means clean & it is not too comfortable as one cannot find a clean spot to rest in. The sea is very smooth with just a little ground swell. 
 1918 July 29 Monday Still getting along safely. The sea is very calm & the weather very warm. No news though about anything We have not sighted a boat of any description for days past. We appear to be right off the tracks of any boats.
