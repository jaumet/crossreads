 Weather getting warmer now, soon hot weather again. Another mine blown up on Beach. A little more peace from bombs last day or two. Our Airmen dropped a message in  Beersheba  to say for every Bomb the Turksdropped we would drop 5. My mind keeps thinking over the collection of worms at a spot on the Road at Rafa - so like a lot of Rabbits after you have cleaned a PIT out some jumping about others lying quite still. I'm quite used to such sights & they do not affect me now I am glad to say.
