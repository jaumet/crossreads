  
 in charge of the mules etc, went over to the Arcadian, lying just near us & told them that we were nearly out of provisions & fodder & suggested that we should go to Alexandria for some.  After consideration they decided to let us go & at the same time to put a mail on us which amounted to 66 bags.  We wont care when we return if they keep us here 3 months, as we will be prepared.  All lights are to be out tonight as there are supposed to be submarines about.  We have on board Colonel Armstrong an Army Paymaster & he has been telling us about the awful experiences of our men on shore. 
 May 21st After an uneventful trip through the Grecian Archipelago & some beautiful Meditteranean scenery & Islands, included among which we passed Rhodes Island, one of the oldest known in history & belonging to Greece, we have arrived at Alexandria.
