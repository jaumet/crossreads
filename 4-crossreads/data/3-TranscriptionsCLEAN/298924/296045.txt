Tuesday 4 March 1919Had Jim Ayre out to dinner - & had a good yarn, he is a great old scandal monger & loves a yarn.  It will be news to you but of course strictly confidential, Dolly thinks she may be having another Babe in 8 months time - so am keen to get settled, but we hope it may not be so yet.Dolly has a big appetite compared to any of our family & eats as much as I do.  Of course she is nursing her Babe herself & she is 7 months & gets no artificial food of any sort.
