 Friday 7 December 
 Dull &amp; cold. Early morning (6 a.m.) trip with Casualty wire Run to Adv. Dressing Station at Khandahah Farm Nothing else to do today Heard the sad news of Reg Cannon's death.  His head was blown right off last night. Had a look over the RE8 aeroplane which landed on rough ground near our camp &amp; was considerably smashed. The bow hut in which I am living is very comfortable.  We have a fire going all day long.
