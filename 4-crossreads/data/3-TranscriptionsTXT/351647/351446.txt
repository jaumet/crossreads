You must not take old Pete too seriously.  I hope they are happy anyhow &amp; he certainly has a prize.
How did the Races go on 29 Dec.  I wonder what sort of a time you are having at Manly.
Well Mistress mine I must slope off.  I wish I could write pages and pages but somehow the gift isn't there.  Its sweet of you to write so often &amp; at such times &amp; I appreciate &amp; am most puffed up &amp; I'm not getting tubby &amp; bald, just greyer than ever &amp; very pursey round the eyes.  My boots still twist into weird shapes, I'll never be a soldier like person but I get along somehow.
I will write soon again, my stress of work won't last for ever thank Gawd.
I was out riding today about the 3rd time in 6 months, I love ? it as much as ever.  I'm afraid I shall never love riding again now that Gramps is dead.  What will I do, I'll never manage a motor bike or car &amp; I can't walk everywhere &amp; I can't sit still like a cabbage.
I'm quite anxious about your book, I do wonder how the first is faring &amp; how the second progressing.  How is Graham &amp; is he loving the surf, I'm hating missing his growing up.
Hope Mac is less worried &amp; the Boss doing &amp; keeping well.  Tell the dear old chaps I'll write very soon.  Cheerio my very dear missus, much love &amp; every good wish.
Yours alwaysWilks
