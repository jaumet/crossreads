<p>9th August 1916<br/>The mess business turned out all right. Riding School &amp; signalling morning. Had leave all the afternoon till 10.45 night. Went to Arlseford by car to visit the fete which was held for Red Cross. Was not much of a show. The grounds of the house where they had the show was very pretty. The village of Arlseford is a slow show, but with plenty of pubs. Some of the boys &amp; myself got slightly mixed &amp; our car did not turn up &amp; had to walk 5 lovely miles to camp. Arrived home out of breath. Had a shower &amp; slept well.</p>
<p>10th August 1916<br/>Riding School &amp; signalling. After parade got ready for Winchester. Went in by carriage &amp; after a few [indecipherable] went to the Fete. Better than the Arlseford affair, but nothing much anyhow. Saw some girl home named Evelyn &amp; afterwards walked up on the camp road. Arrived back tired. Had a shower &amp; went to bed.</p>
