<p>the Post Office and he has been at Hawksebury College (cant spell) - Butter dept.<br/>Wests people had a place but have had to retire as they are too old to work it   &amp; the three sons have gone to the war, he himself was a wool classer &amp; an overseer and a merino man.  I have asked him up home to show him the Corriedales.<br/>We are going to give each other our peoples addresses and we want you to form a section at home so that you will be always to get news of us.  Jack Glennie is also in B squadron so you can always ring up there and get news of us.<br/>It is nice having the small formations in Light Horse; we four can now stick together properly share all our things and take turn about as horse holders for the sections etc. - I do seem to be lucky in always getting with good chaps dont I?<br/>West is bald &amp; Dawson gone quite white so Thorpe &amp; I are the younguns of the section.<br/>Poor old Bill Graham is now reported killed: I have two photos of him taken the day before &amp; if they are any good I will send them to his Father; he lives at Beechwood Hastings River.  I thought you might like to write to him.  I never heard Bill speak of his mother so don't think he has one. Must go to "stables" now will finish this in the tent</p>
