3/2/18 Selles
busy with typewriter and clerks. The amount of paper used in this War is something enormous and seems to increase. Returns and memorandums of all sorts everywhere ? no wonder they are kept busy. Old P.V. Martin is in trouble once more and now in the guard room. Put different specialist officers on to new jobs - JA Smith on the Lewis guns, Greene on the Musketry c and hope that these new brooms will sweep clean. Owing to so much business I have had no time to talk with the family here today beyond ?Bon Jour? and ?Bon Soir?. There is a decidedly good looking wench full of blushes. The small one's a little flapper. A dull raw day and fuel for fires is short.
