<p>26th contd<br/>We had a long yarn about old times &amp; was very much interested in the Coffs Harbor &amp; Dorrigo district.  I went to Croydon with him &amp; stayed at the Fergusons.</p>
<p>27th Novr<br/>Collected my baggage together ready to go home.  Met Mrs Jno Beaumont &amp; Mavis Edwards on the train at Ashfield &amp; got some Yanco news.  Went out to Drummoyne by the 10.15am boat &amp; stayed there the rest of the day.  Called in at the Farmer &amp; Settler office &amp; saw Mr Morice &amp; Normie.  They told me of Dorothy's engagement.   Mr Morice wants me to contribute news from time to time to the F &amp; S &amp; is going to provide me with a duplicate diary for that purpose.  Caught the 7.15 Glen Innes mail &amp; wired Doug</p>
