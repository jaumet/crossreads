<p>Marched off this evening; we have collected a band, and they led the way to the train. The old "rattler" conveyed us to a certain point, then we marched across country through hedges and across ditches till we came to this place; where I am living under the Lille Road. The 2nd Brigade were here. They are a good mob to come in after.<br/>26/9/16.<br/>Was posted as ""Gas Guard", over a huge Strombos Horn, in the grounds of a fine Chateau, now more or less ruined. We call it "Bedford House". By the neglected ponds and gardens it seems to have been a fine place. But now the fine oak trees are splintered with shells and its rose garden is a cemetery. About 3.A.M. some one started a gas alarm.</p>
