<p>14.10.15<br/>Thurs 14th<br/>I believe the Canteen at Imbros was not warned that so many order were likely to come in  &amp; the amount of goods we sent for were not available; We have to find a guard at present to protect what was available &amp; is now on the beach, it arrived yesterday afternoon; Nelson came on the scene this afternoon fit for duty &amp; took over, I have not to go on duty tonight letting things go just as they were; Stan has been complaining right along that he is not well but I have never felt fitter; I have been right off my tucker the last few days but feel as fit as a fiddle nevertheless The Hospital boats are constantly on the go between here &amp; Alexandria.</p>
