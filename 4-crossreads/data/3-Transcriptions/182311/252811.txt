<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some day I&#39;ll tell you the whole story, now only a portion of it.&nbsp; Of a train journey, a Channel Crossing, my first sight of a French town and my impressions thereof, of a march to a Rest Camp, the Rest, of another train journey long, slow and uncomfortable for thirtysix hours, and then transport by motor-buses to the vicinity of our rural billets, our two days spent in these billets, eighty men billeted on a farmer and a small farmer too, sleeping in his barn, the officers in his guest room even that a miserable affair. Uncomfortable times, yes, but also a very joyous experience for we all consider-ed them as experiences and appreciate too the novelty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the peasant life of this district we all now know something, having lived amongst them almost, in my case, as one of them, for though drawing our rations from our own Q.M. we bought much from them and ate it all in their one large room.&nbsp; These peasants have very insanitary modes of life which in Australia would instantly produce typhoid, here it doesn&#39;t seem to matter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pigsty adjoining the eating room, and all the farm buildings closely grouped around a foul cesspool into which all litter and refuse from farmyard and dwelling is thrown and removed therefrom only when required as a fertilizer.&nbsp; The buildings are very solid . . . . . .</p>
<p>(This is an old, unposted letter)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAROLD.</p>
