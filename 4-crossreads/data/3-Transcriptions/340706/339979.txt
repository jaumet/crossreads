<p>closed &amp; military guard put on so I wander around unshaven till about 3 pm.</p>
<p>Trams here are free &amp; the whole city is encircled by boulevards. By taking certain trams &amp; changing at certain places the complete circuit can be made The Belgian who tells me this goes out of his way to put me on the tram. They are so grateful to be free of the German occupation that nothing is too much trouble for them. The tram pass all the sights [indecipherable] Palace, mus&eacute;e, [indecipherable] etc (see pic).</p>
<p>I return &amp; get out &amp; visit Palais de Justice the largest building in Europe &amp; who immense proportions stagger the imagination &amp; leave one spell bound &amp; awestrucken. Entrance is forbidden as this is Sunday but I open a door &amp; sail in, find someone &amp; explain my wish &amp; the shortness of my stay &amp; a guide &amp; a Belgian law student show me over. The Place des Pas Perdus under the dome &amp; the vast staircase still more bewilder one with their vastness. The only word I could use to express to my friends was that it was "immense"</p>
<p>I then take tram to Bois de Cambre a pretty wooded parc with a large lake &amp; wooded isle in the midst on which island is build a rustic village hidden by trees &amp; shrubs. A restaurant with iced drinks exists in the centre though never closed</p>
