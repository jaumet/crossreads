<p>for at 7.45 the rifle fire became very severe.  Though the W.S. bombarded so heavily &amp; it seemed impossible for anyone to live through it, the volume of the Turkish musketry (recognisable by the note) indicated that a large number of them remained.  Throughout the engagement the w.s. played their searchlights on the Turkish positions, presumably to blind the Turks &amp; show our men the lay of the land.  This is not the only point where there was firing tonight, for away to the Southward Achi Baba was simply alight with bursting shells, and the flash and boom of the w.s. guns was continuous for hours.</p>
