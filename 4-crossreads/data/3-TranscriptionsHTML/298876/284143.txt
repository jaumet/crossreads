<p>Thursday<br/>2/3/16</p>
<p>Muggy all day &ndash; sea just like a river, not a ripple. Have passed a great number of Boats again from the aristocratic looking P &amp; O Line to the dilapidated Garden variety of tramp. No sign of land all day. Was running about all night again, fixing up fellows with all sorts of ailments forward, aft, bottom deck etc.</p>
<p>Pay day today, and every nook and corner has its own line of gambling &ndash; From a dollar he don't head em &ndash; to haps &ndash; etc.</p>
<p>Am real good cobbers with Chief Steward &ndash; result get some rattling good midnight Feed ups. Duck, Chicken, Eggs, Chipped Potatoes, Puddings etc. Tea &amp; Toast at 4 am.</p>
<p>Rumoured we will reach "Suez" Sunday morning &ndash; All crimed men working in the Coal Bunkers.</p>
