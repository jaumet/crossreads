<p>Aug 29 1 pm Sighted land, &amp; 4 steamers, all the boys are excited after their enforced idleness. And we have seen practically nil for 21 days. Sighted table Mtn at 2 pm &ndash; about 50 odd miles distant. Arrived Capetown 7.30 &amp; anchored in the Harbor.<br/>[in margin] (Capetown)</p>
<p>30 Came alongside early this mng. The Miltiades (a sister ship to this) is on our Starboard side &amp; has Vic's &amp; WA's on board.<br/>Table Mtn is close by, but don't think I'd like to climb it. Weather good, but misty. No sign of leave yet. <u>Later</u> - Came ashore at 11 am &amp; go back</p>
