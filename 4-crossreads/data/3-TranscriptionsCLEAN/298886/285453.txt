They bit & kicked each other most un unmercifully one even got the other one down but he was soon up   The natives were powerless in such an emergency and made no attempt to catch either and when one comes to think of it it would require a man of great presence of mind to separate two such desperate fighters.
After a few minutes they got in amongst our horses and men who were at that time watering and it was the greatest miracle in the world that some one - either horse or man - did not get their heads kicked off for such a beautiful display of swift flying heels and gnashing teeth it would be difficult to imagine.
The black stallion eventually got the worst of the deal because he bolted away through our horses & men at a rate which only an Arab thoroughbred horse can go with the brown fellow close at his heels. Every time the brown stallion bit the other one he got measure for measure both heels invariably took effect but they raced on right through Head Quarters and then through A B & C Squadron and away to the rear of the Regiment past all the transport as the Australian says " Going for the lick of their life"
