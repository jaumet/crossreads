<p>III<br/>"The 18th of June 1815"</p>
<p>"Had it not rained in the night of the 17th of June 1815, the future of Europe would have been changed.</p>
<p>&hellip; the ground was soft.  It was necessary to wait for it to acquire some little firmness so that the artillery could manoeuvre.</p>
<p>V<br/>"Note a circumstance:  There were in the English Infantry, particularly in Kempt's brigade many raw recruits.  These young soldiers, before our formidable infantry, were heroic;  their inexperience bore itself boldly in the affair:  they did especially good work as skirmishes:  the soldier as a skirmisher, to some extent left to himself, becomes, so as to speak, his own general:  these recruits exhibited something of French invention and French fury.  This raw infantry shewed enthusiasm.  That displeased Wellington&hellip;  Its been noted several times:  but the Englander, labouring under the delusion that his character and way of life are only admired and not understood by the Continental refuses the recognition.</p>
<p>VI<br/>"All about the plateau, the English had cut away the hedge here and there, made embrasures in the hawthorns, thrust the mouth of a cannon between two branches, made loopholes in the thicket.  The hedge gun batteries by us."</p>
<p>Chapters IX and X &ndash; quite inseparable, and a disruption full of splendid phrases, as splendid as a great Greek ruin.</p>
<p>Was it possible that Napoleon should win this battle?  We answer no?  Why?  Because of Wellington?  Because of Blucher?  No.  Because of God &hellip;  Napoleon had been impeached before the Infinite, and his fall was decreed.  The vexed God.  Waterloo is not a battle;  it is the change of front of the Universe.</p>
<p>What is Waterloo?  A victory?  No.  A prize.  A prize won by Europe, paid by France.</p>
<p>It is not much to put in line there.</p>
<p>No, it is not much to put in line there, but it is typically English.  When they were stampeding on the Somme, the Daily Mail headed its news, "Hunting the Hun back".</p>
