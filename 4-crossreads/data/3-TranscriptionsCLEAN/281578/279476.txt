empty thermos & tins from the stew & tea earlier in the night. The party did growl, it's a long way down to that Crucifix & in the dark you stumble into shell holes. The pace was a cracker too, wasn't I tired & fed up; the only comic side, & I couldn't help laughing, was when two chaps in front of me were carrying a thermos, there was a ledge about 2 feet high, but one didn't see the drop down, he took the next step as usual, & simply slid & lay flat on his back. Didn't he swear, eh, it was the finishing touch to his pent-up opinion of the war. The other cove who allowed for the drop, said " I told you it was there, you dope." Found our way back to our respective pozzies again, & got our tea & bacon. A drop of rum was issued later, also 3 packets of cigarettes & box of matches, & tomorrow's ration of bread, margarine & jam, it is mighty scanty for a day too, I could simply devour some roast beef & spuds now. "Turned in" at 5a.m., woke at 10, had "chat" (not a talk), & Shortland & I ate some of our bread & margarine & jam, could have eaten it all myself in one act. It is very misty with drizzling rain, no aeroplanes are up, & some of our guns are firing as I write at 1 p.m., but not a shot
