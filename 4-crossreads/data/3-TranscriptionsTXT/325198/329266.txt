 10 March, 1916 Suez Canal, Serapeum Last night A troop was on Inlying picquet , nothing to do but its not much chop having to keep ones gear on all night &amp; expecting to be called out every minute, however I slept fairly well.  This morning when we got up at 6.0, Beuzeville, Flanigan &amp; I were told to get kitted up &amp; 24 hrs rations &amp; our haversacks &amp; water bottles for we were to go on as body guard to the General.  Lieut McKenzie said that we were on a good wicket &amp; would likely be away for three or four days &amp; go to Ismalia etc  We had to go mounted &amp; men were sent with us to take the horses back. 
 However we found that we had to go over the Pontoon Bridge on the canal &amp; report there for ordinary guard &amp; our disgust may well be imagined when we were told off for our respective posts.  There were nine on the Guard under Seg Collins &amp; we started with 3 posts which were reduced to 2 posts later &amp; I took place as Corporal. One thing it is quiet &amp; we have a house to doss in, a room to each relief  The buildings we are guarding are to be the Headquarters of the New Zealand &amp; Australian Mounted Division which is being formed
