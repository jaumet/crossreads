<p>First frost, did nothing.</p>
<p>Tuesday 15th</p>
<p>War news still good.  The rumers here are wonderfull, have even heard that orders to cease fire have been given.  Some of them come in with all sorts of tales at night from Havre &amp; the others are disapointed when they are not in next day's paper.  It won't last long maybe a week maybe a month is my opinion.  Went to Pictures evening.</p>
