  
 trees, & the quaint old gabled Houses covered with the beautiful Virginia creeper, the dark fields, the newly ploughed fields, the late Hay-makers, all made a lovely Picture.  I received your Parcel of Sugar, Chocs. etc. on return.  I played Hockey in the afternoon & danced from 6.30 to 10 p.m. & did the same yesterday.  I went for a long walk in the lovely moonlight halfway towards Park House where Jim Robertson is camped waiting for Transport to Aussie & rode down to the village yesterday to visit a sick Friend.  You will observe that I have no time to mope or grow lazy when my work has to be done as well. 
 Well, Dad dear, I'll write to George early in the week & will now say Good luck, health & happiness to you all, 
 Harry.
