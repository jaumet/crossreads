8 May, 1916Bir el ahb [Abd]We joined up with the troops as they moved away towards the East about eight thirty & kept going for several miles & then formed up at a place called Oghratina here we fed up & re filled our water bottles & grabbed what sleep we could while holding our horses.  About 4.30 this morning we started again & this time we thought we would see some stouch but when we got to this God forsaken hole the Turks has floated.  A Squadron saw the last of them.  Here we are waiting for whats next. I suppose it will be return.  Bill Ross is [indecipherable] out, his hat off & the sun powering down on him snoring a treat.  [indecipherable] reported all clear.
