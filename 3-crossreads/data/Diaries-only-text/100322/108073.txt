Havre
and went round the Quais in our lorry. Returned to Tortonis caf which seems the centre of gaiety of Havre. Walked through disreputable and old streets to an old place called La Grosse Yonne a place famed as the headquarters of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Dark dingy and low looking but they serve up a meal here better cooked than you will find anywhere else in Havre. We dined very well. The other people were of varying types. Afterwards walked along the seafront and the moonlight on the water was very pretty. Had a ?bonnet de nuit" at the Tortoni place and then lorried home. From an elevated place near Harfleur one gets a fine view of water, twinkling lights and moonshine ? something a little like the Napolitan bay. From Havre to the camp is about 6 miles.
