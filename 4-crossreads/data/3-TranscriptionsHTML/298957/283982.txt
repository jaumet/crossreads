<p>29th March (Wednesday)<br/>Another fearfully hot day. Commencing a little later than hitherto we resumed the march which today only consisted of going through Ismailia and across the Canal to Ferry Post Camp. The Prince of Wales was riding round us at Moascar just before we left and the boys gathered round him. He watched us march out.<br/>The change of surroundings form sand to green trees and a good road made conditions much better today. By the way, this road in Ismailia</p>
