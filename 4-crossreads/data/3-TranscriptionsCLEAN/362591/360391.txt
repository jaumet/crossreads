My dear Judge
I was very glad to receive your letter.  Some time back I wrote Edgar Lucas to send for you to have a look at different photos which I had either taken or collected of bits of Egypt & Gallipoli & should you wish it to give you prints of such of them as I had sent him the films of.  This I thought would interest you more than letter writing at which I'm not too good & which owing to censorship rules must of necessity be restricted to more or less uninteresting matter altho it would appear from extracts from letters appearing in Australian papers that one sees here now & then that for many people
