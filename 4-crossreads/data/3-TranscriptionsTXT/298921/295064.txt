 April, 1915 Thursday 1 Went via Cairo route March to Barrage on Nile &amp; bivouac for the night, wrote Laura &amp; Mrs Ferrar this morning &ndash; The Gardens here are the prettiest I have seen since leaving Australia. There is also a Museum, showing plans of all the Dams, Locks &amp; Weirs. At night there is a continual roar of Rushing water &amp; the mosquitoes were very bad &ndash; The men camped among the trees, quite a treat after the Desert. Every tree is covered with Bougainvillia or Roses, a most artistic spot. We swam all the horses across the Nile on an endless rope, it took about 20 minutes for Squadron 164
