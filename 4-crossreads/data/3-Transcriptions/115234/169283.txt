<p>Shrapnell, ([P??????]) &amp; 5-9 s&nbsp; Had a couple of narrow escapes.&nbsp; Got home at midnight &amp; turned in.&nbsp; Just an item in the nightly life of a modern soldier.&nbsp; On the way up passed the historic crater that was once Messines.&nbsp; Nearly a Division of Germans lie buried beneath the great upheaval.&nbsp; A wonderful tribute to the skill of the Australian Mining Corps. Am to go up again on the same job tonight.</p>
