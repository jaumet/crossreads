<p>28th June 1916. Wed. 1916. Romani.</p>
<p>We witnessed this morning one of the Sights of a lifetime &ndash; an Aeroplane duel -. A German Taube had been reported going in the direction of Kantara immediately all wires and telephones and wireless buzzed. Everyone was on the alert. The Brigadier caused the aeroplane alarm to be sounded &ndash; a succession of long blasts on a whistle Everyone sprang out and got the horses clear of the lines and away from the Camp. All my horses (18) <strike>were</strike> had gone to the Shade of the palms previously so I had not much to worry about.</p>
<p>Quarter of an hour, half an hour - No sign of any hostile aerocraft, when suddenly the shout "here she comes"! was heard on all sides Telescopes and field glasses were soon focussed on the  approaching aeroplane which was making for our Camp at great speed. "Look out she's a Taube"! Everyone opened out in case she dropped bombs. Sure enough she had the dreaded Maltese Cross</p>
