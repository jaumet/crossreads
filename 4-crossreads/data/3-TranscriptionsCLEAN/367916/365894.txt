  
 Headquarters Desert Mtd Corps E E F 26/7/18 
 My dear Judge, I have several lots of thanks to offer you - for a letter I received a few days ago enclosing some very interesting cuttings from Sydney papers, for several issues of the "Current History" & several parcels of chocolate that have arrived since I last wrote. 
 I should have written before to ask you to refrain from sending any more chocolate as the Summer is too much for even the air tight tins & it is arriving melted. It will harden as a matter of fact on ice of which I get a supply for "medical comforts" but it is to a large extent wasted in this climate. 
 [Gullet] has left us now - permanently I think. He has taken on a job as War Correspondent & becomes a Civilian again, I understand. He is now at GHQ and will probably remain there or at least make that his headquarters. 
 You have I expect heard about the show over here a week or so ago. The enemy put up a stunt which resulted in his losing 600 prisoners & a proportionate number killed. We lost somewhere about 60 altogether. It was a very neat bit of work on the part of the Light Horse. 
 The prisoners were done to the world when I saw them
