<p>Dear Mr &amp; Mrs Garling<br/>I was very grieved indeed to hear from Arnold a few days ago that Terence has been killed.  Please accept my deepest sympathy.  I cannot express just how I feel for you &amp; Pat.  It is a great sacrifice &amp; a hard one that parents are called upon to make in these awful times &ndash; but one that I know full well that you were prepared &amp; proud to make &ndash; My sympathy goes out to you &amp; yours &ndash; Terence I was proud to have as a friend &amp; to be counted as one of his &ndash; such a gentleman one seldom meets out here while yours is a sad &amp; terrible loss &ndash; Australias loss is a far greater one for she can ill afford to loose such men.<br/>The position just now is certainly serious, but nevertheless we shall ultimately conquer, it cannot be otherwise, as right is on our</p>
