<p>March  Sunday 4 1917</p>
<p>Another Sunday in the line. One cannot discern any difference from other days. There is none here. Turned cold again. <br/>Very slack, few wounded through. Thank goodness that the killing has slackened off even for a little while. <br/>Poor old McDonald who was hit yesterday died. This war is a holacost, one after the other pass out, friend amp; foe, comrade &amp; combatant. We are weary of the awful waste.</p>
