 form now &amp; again &amp; took what they wanted &ndash; paying of course with chits.  Some of the people here speak English well &ndash; in fact there are a proportion of American &amp; even Australian Jews amongst them tho the majority are Russian subjects if what they claim is correct.  Hebrew &amp; Arabic they all speak &amp; many German also not to mention French.  Incidentally my French has not markedly improved.  When I get stuck I can usually make myself understood after hard thinking, in that language but conversations in which I engage are always rather laborious &amp; would, I am sure, sound ludicrous to, for instance, your friend &ndash; the Mademoiselle whom Dorothy delighted to pair me with. 
 You must be getting tired of all this, so I will not tax your patience further. 
 I will look up L/Cpl. Blackwell the first time I am near the 1st Brigade. 
 Hope you &amp; Mrs. Ferguson, Dorothy &amp; Keith are all well.  My best regards to yourself &amp; them &ndash; also to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Curtis.  I myself am perfectly O.K. 
 Yours very sincerely R.J. Hunter
