6/8/18Villers-BretonneuxOur chaps had their dinner and then moved off for the front line posts some time about 11. Fritz planes came over and dropped a few bombs. Our searchlights were a great sight all massed together. The Boche had one solitary ray only and was releasing his famous "onion" strings. Our relief of the 21st Battalion was not completed until the early hours of the morning. While Barley of the 21st was showing Madden the location of the flank post of next door battalion he got sniped and received a nasty wound in his forehead. Only his steel helmet saved his life. He came down to Bn. H.Q. with much array of blood stained bandage and was cheerful enough but will feel the shock in a few hours.
