The Battery was shelled badly again yesterday, the cook-house [reference to cook-house may have been crossed through?] being razed to the ground. Mr Cullen went to pieces again and is consequently down here for another spell. He had a personal yarn to me this morning and said I deserved promotion and he would do what he could for me.
