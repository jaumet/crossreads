<p>It was a magnificent trip &amp; I wouldn't have missed it for anything. The scenery was glorious. We passed numbers of bungalows which defy description. They were superb. The native quarters we passed were very interesting too. On the way out our car ran out of water, so we pulled up outside one of the Bungalows &amp; asked for water. The owner of the place, showed the native driver &amp; his assistant where to obtain water, then he came &amp; had a yarn with us. He appeared mighty interested in our descriptions of England &amp; France. I imagine him to be some Gov. official. He informed us that his wife had just returned from England, &amp; was amused at the idea of having Ration Cards. He said his wife told him all about the rations, but he had not seen a Ration Book  so we showed him ours. After filling our water tank we moved off again &amp; arrived at the Cemetery Gardens which were very beautiful. Flowers of every hue &amp; beautiful foliages. Our Guide showed us into a Buddhist Temple. The Gardens were beautifully kept. It would almost be nice to die in Colombo if we could be buried in such a glorious spot (I don't want to peg out yet, tho', I want to see my B.E. first) We passed plenty of diggers on the Road, in rickshaw [indecipherable] gharrys &amp; all kinds of conveyances. It was about a two hour trip in the car, &amp; was quite the best 1/6 worth I ever had in my Life.<br/>I went with Yank to visit some</p>
