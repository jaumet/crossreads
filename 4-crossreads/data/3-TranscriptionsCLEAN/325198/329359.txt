9 Sept, 1916EtmalerBack with the Reg once more.  It's a homely thought of feeling.  Not so classy at Montazah the tent is in the most unlovely disorder.  I left at 2.0 yesterday & got at Sidi Gaber at 2.30 & had there until 3.50 so Pat Little & I caught a tram & flopped into Alex, we had an exciting trip back getting there on the tick.  I sat tight when they cried "Get out" at Moasar & so came right on to Kantara.  A Lan cashire lad took me under his wing & escorted me to a tent where I had a bunk for the night & a breakfast this morning
Caught train at 9.15 & at last got to Romanai station.  I was talking to one of the boys when his horse gave a jump & lobbed on my foot, good job the sand is soft or it would have been a trip back to the hospital again.  The boys are all getting ready for Ber. el Abe [Bir-el-Abd] & I just got back in time to pass in my Kit bags - Woods & [indecipherable] are having a spin. Guess there is some dirty work going on  by the way Joe is talking - Lea & he were arguing on Zeps.  Lea reckoned that they were not so bad as painted.  Joe said no & 200 lb bomb would nt hurt, only knock a bit of skin off if it hit you
