An exquisite day. The first leaves fell from the trees today - Autumn. On the grass was a heavy dew. From the front came a rolling and heavy cannonade that continued until late in the day. The Battalion paraded as a whole and then did specialist work. In the afternoon were Sports and we received word that the break up of the 21st was definitely decided upon. All the coys. supplied 50 men each for a concert at D.H.Q. I went along later to see Col. Durrant about Wood and other matters and then looked in. It was not a bad show at all. Coming back had a yarn with Dr. and others. There is talk of the 21st. jibbing tomorrow but I don't think it will come to anything. After a yarn in the mess - routine work.
