of spelling just close to this old church there is a brass tablet erected to the memory of the martyrs who were burned to death by order of Bloody Mary, St Bartholmew Hospital is just close here too. From this old church we were taken round to the famous Smithfield meat markets they are most enomorous things nearly a quarter of a mile long containing hundreds of thousands of beef & mutton carcase's & are an eyeopener alright.From Smithfield we struck off home had our tea, & then set out for the Gaiety, here we booked 2 seats which cost us 13/- for the Dress Circle the play was entitled "Tonight's the night" & was a scream from start to finish.
