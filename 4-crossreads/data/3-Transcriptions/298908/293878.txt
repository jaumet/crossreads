<p>bad but us they catch the "Diggers" for such trifles as these.</p>
<p>28th.  Never felt so rotten for many a long day as I have done practically all last night, I had a fit of the "blues", &amp; nothing could please me.  I just felt as if I wanted to be left alone.  The lady who I was with tried her hardest to cheer me up.  She took me to a dance thinking the music &amp; life would do me good but she could not have picked a worse place for I can't dance &amp; this only made me feel worse.  We did not stop there long so she took me home &amp; there we spent the rest of the evening with the family.  I soon came round then &amp; by the time I left I was in the best of spirits.  The last time I had a fit of these "blues" was nearly a year ago at "Rossignol Wood" just close to Ypres.  The only thing I can put them down to is restlessness &amp; dissatisfaction with the whole concern &amp; I am sure until I get out of the Military I shall often have them.</p>
