<p>The Knight Templars men, going into our old billet, and are isolated, quarantined, in fact<br/>30-3-1916<br/>Marching orders recieved. Move off at 2 P.M. to entrain. This order was cancelled later<br/>31-3-1916<br/>Marching orders again recieved. Move out at 3 P.M. Weather improving, but still dull. Orders again cancelled<br/>1-4-1916<br/>Leave granted for &frac12; day Saturday. Went to Marseilles. Had a look around. Very clean city particularly after Egypt. All streets paved with stones. Tram fares cheap, 8 miles for one penny: A number of wounded French in the city legs off, maimed and blind, Hundreds wearing decorations. The most decorated people I have ever seen, almost every soldier wears a medal of some sort. A sight that make one think, is the milliners shops absolutely all Crepe, particularly the women hats. Hundreds of women in mourning. Dull weather but fine<br/>2-4-1916<br/>The rations issued here, are very light</p>
