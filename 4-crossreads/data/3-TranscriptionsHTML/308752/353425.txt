<p>March 21st.</p>
<p>This morning I had to go to the first Post we stopped at on the 17th inst. for stores. The distance was about 3 miles, as the weather has been wet for the last couple of days, the mud was frightful, I sank up to my knees init in some places. On returning to the Dressing Station we received orders to move further on. Three squads left at 2 p.m. &amp; we marched about 3 miles to the next village, where another Dressing Station is situated. From here the wounded are taken on by car the roads being in a fair condition.  The country between the town an this village was looking very fine, it must be a great set back to Fritz to have to give this all up. I noticed plenty of barbed wire entanglements scattered about. The village was also a mass of ruins, Fritz played havoc with the place, it is a cruel sight. Of course this is all in the game of war fare, we read in History that when an Army has been retreating they destroy everything so as to check the advancing army. The noise of the Straffing could be heard, but it is a long way off. We will have a nice soft job here, preparing the roads which the enemy had destroyed, so as to enable the Ambulance cars to proceed further along. At almost every cross-road</p>
