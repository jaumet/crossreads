<p>Thursday June 6<br/>Went out to N.Z. Brigade Field Amb. Temporalily attached. Camp situated at Solomon's pools about half way between Hebron &amp; Bethlehem. These pools are there in number of considerable depth &amp; size. At present they contain water so we are in a handy position as regards watering. There are snakes in these pools &amp; in vicinity. Solomons  gardens all that is left of them lie a little lower down from the pools.<br/>Friday June 7<br/>2ND Brigade came in to day from the valley looking absolute wrecks. Heard we will be moving in few days</p>
