She was kind to you.<br/>Fancy wounded men in Australia when you were passing along George Street. I fear me that you will have plenty more during the coming months.<br/>Yes many of the men who arrived went through my hospital.

Desireable sites every where for residences. You had a very good stand for the stall on Australia day. Hope that you did well?<br/>Tell Maria to beware of Nuts? Silly girl to chance them once more. An experiment probably to find if she were growing more resistant to them. Not so.<br/>How good of Mrs Franki to think of us and make the covers for the milk jugs, just the thing I am wanting at the moment, when they come they will be made use of, it is said by residents that Septbr. &amp; October are the worst months for flies.
