<p>Tell me in your letter if you are getting the money OK. It should be &pound;1/1/- a week now I altered the amount.</p>
<p>Dearest Mother,</p>
<p>We have got away alright, and for the benefit of the Censor, we are going to "-"had him, he thought I was going to put Gallipoli. I'm afraid I am not going to be on such a good wicket as last time, as regards writing so far, but leave it to me, I haven't had much of a chance to look around yet. We did not leave the Harbour till 4 pm on Thursday, and I saw Father on the way down to the Wharf, but no one else I knew. I never saw such a crowd to see any boat off there were far more than at the "Orsova", and all the time we were in the stream, scores of rowing boats &amp; launches came round and made it quite gay. It has been a lovely trip so far, quite smooth and warm &amp; no one has been sick. The tucker is fine, and if we keep on going as we are now, it will take about 3 months hard work to get the fat off us, when we arrive on the other side. It is rumoured we are not calling anywhere, but going right into action.</p>
