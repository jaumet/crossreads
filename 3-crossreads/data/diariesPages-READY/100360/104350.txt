Tue. Mar. 6. Archie Deed is assisting me in the Blanket Store. They are tossing the Patients out wholesale & we are crowded out with Blankets. Had a rehearsal after Tea. Bobbie Roberts was coming to give us a hand but he was taken sick.

Wed. 7. Got some new songs for our Show also a new opening Chorus which is some class.

Thurs. Mar. 8. Heavy Frost. Jolly cold. There is a rumour going round that Leave is starting again. Hope to the Lord its true.

Fri. Mar. 9. Went out to Meaulte & put our Show on in the Y.M.C.A. Hut. "Props" Hargraves went over about mid-day & fixed up the stage. Sgt. Major Scanlan of the 2nd D.A.C. the M.T’s (Empties) had made arrangements for us & the show went off A.1. The Col was there & enjoyed it very much. The Building was packed. After the Show the D.A.C. took us to their Camp & gave us a Banquet in their Sergeant’s Mess.
