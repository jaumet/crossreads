The night is cold & wrapped in overcoat & lifebelt I prepare my place & we move out of harbour at 10 pm doing 23 knots per hour by S.S. "Caesarea". Expect little sleep but prepare my place & drop off 1 am
22nd July:- SaturdayAwake at 5 am with the rain pouring on me, cold & a feeling of a large lump in the middle of my back which is caused by the lifebelt   Soon hasten below, take off the offending belt & overcoat, have a wash in a dixie    & get my kit together. The "wooden walls of Old England" are in sight, we having safely passed the boom at Southampton. All is excitement on board, as there are also hundreds of Tommies returning home on leave  Wait until 7 am to cross the second boom, meanwhile viewing old England's coasts, my feelings run high at really finding myself here. The drizzling rain soon cleared & we moor at the wharf at 7-15 am & disembark  Then follows two hours strenuous work of unloading the big cases to the trucks (by sling) & at 10 am we have a mess tin of tea, after which, we don our equipment & march
