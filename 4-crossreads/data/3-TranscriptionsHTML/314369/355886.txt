<p>8 September 1915<br/>Wednesday</p>
<p>Foot getting on well but have a queer swelling of the glands of the neck which is both painful   &amp;  annoying as it is very difficult for me to move in bed.<br/>Dad comes in after tea  &amp;  cheers me up a good bit.<br/>It is very queer how I look forward to seeing him.</p>
<p>1915 September 9<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Neck slightly easier this morning   &amp;  I feel brighter generally. My writing can be taken as a fair guide to the state of my nerves   &amp;  muscles. I am as weak as a kitten</p>
