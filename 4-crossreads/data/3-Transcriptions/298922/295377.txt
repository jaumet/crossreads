<p>Tuesday 20 February 1917</p>
<p>I was warned last night to be ready to attend a Cavalry School at Zeitoun, a suburb of Cairo for 1 month &ndash; I am glad &ndash; it means a refresher, a course for Senior Officers &ndash; BATHS, clean clothes &amp; Tucker &amp; a chance to get rid of my infernal NILE BOILS etc:-  I go in about 3 days time.</p>
<p>Yesterday a few HATS were being issued &ndash; 1 Soldier tried one &amp; said QUATER (meaning Q.M.S.) this hat is too small, what one is it &ndash; the Quartermaster Sergeant replied 6 7/8. Well, give me a 9.10.11 replied the Wag (TRUE). Lovely warm day but cold nights still.</p>
<p>[The following sentence crossed through]<br/>Nice letter from Mrs. Auntie MILLS.</p>
