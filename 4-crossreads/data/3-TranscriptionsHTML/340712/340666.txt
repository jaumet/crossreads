<p>BROADMEADOWS,<br/>14/11/15.<br/>We are members of the Sergeants' Mess, where we have a sit down meal with an Orderly to wait on us. The men,however, as far as we can see, sire not at all fairly treated.<br/>Breakfast and dinner, nearly always stew, badly cooked and very economically distributed-&#151;about half as much as they received at Mitcham. The organization is very poor. The men were pretty mutinous. They all want to get back to Mitcham. Things may improve-&#151;and give them a chance to settle down&#151;I hope so. It blows gales here mostly all the time&#151;tons of dirt. We sleep in tents&#151;the centre pole of ours, also another, broke today. When we arrived in Melbourne (after a bitterly cold night) it was all dust&#151;on arrival at Broadmeadows,(about 12 miles out) it rained&#151;since then it has been dust and gales&#151; just now, and quite unexpectedly a fierce hail storm is raging. The blankets I h ave are miserable things&#151;short and thin&#151;-not half as good a s the old Exhibitioners.<br/>We are now out at Williamstown Musketry Ranges, about 10 miles from the City, a small and clean camp, but we have a rotten O.C. No time for anything. He is not much over 20, a snob, a cad, inexperienced and with a supreme desire to show his authority. He seems to have a down on Will and I, but I got a couple home on him yesterday and he actually had the decency to beg my pardon, but of that more anon. 0's0. can make a hell for the men if they like, and this man seems to take a delight in it-&#151;the first I have ever struck of his kind.</p>
