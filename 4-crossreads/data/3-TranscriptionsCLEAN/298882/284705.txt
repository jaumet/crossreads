17th.  A very quiet relief.
We sustained no casualties and the relief was completed early with out a hitch.  Ground in a very bad state.  Fortunately practically no hostile shelling on our sector during night relief.  Enemy very active with his artillery later on in night which gradually eased off towards daylight. Enemy machine guns sniping during night.
