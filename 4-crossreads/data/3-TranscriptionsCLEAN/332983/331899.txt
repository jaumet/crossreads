  
 have I seen so many horse sent to Vet Hospital, with such trivial complaints. Eight in 4 days is our record. The French Cavalry were in action yesterday. Advances 9 miles, and returned again. Saw and old chap killing a pig at this billet. They don't scald the hair off, they burn it off with straw 7-7-1916 Few isolated showers. Still at same old billet, Shod the Colonels horses. A number of our men transferred to trench mortar Bty. (Medium). Talking to Hyland,  told me, a whole detachment got blown out in one hit. (X and Y are Australian Btys) 8-7-1916 Raining again. Very quiet, few planes about, Eleven horses short in Bty. A report to be furnished to Divisional Artillery as regard shoeing 9-7-1916 Fine day (Sunday). The C.O. inspecting our horses again. Rumoured that we move off tomorrow. Huns aeroplanes over. 4 in all; up a terrible hight. No damage done. Thousands of reinforcements arriving here.
