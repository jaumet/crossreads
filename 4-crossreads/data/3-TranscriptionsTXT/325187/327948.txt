[Monday 24 July 1916]
Night marching again  We manage to keep our friends engaged-  Not much time for letters or notes, no sleep- as we draw their fire each morning & keep them in check till night, still very hot.Clive Weston asked for Eleanor Austins address he had seen Stanley or Rupert in Cairo.Two Taubes over today they are top dog till we get faster machines.Shelled Ognatina last night again, but the Light Horse are doing all the work here.Infantry cannot travel over the sand.The Horses eat the green dates well.
