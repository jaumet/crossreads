<p>Dear Mr Waterhouse,</p>
<p>I am greatly indebted to you for your letter enclosing a photograph of Walter. His work throughout his University course was unfortunately excellent and he shows great promise of doing useful research, so that I grudge his temporary absence in obedience to the 'higher call' almost as much as you do. I sincerely hope and trust that he will return safely with added laurels when victory is achieved.</p>
<p>With Kind regards</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely</p>
<p>Robt D Watt</p>
