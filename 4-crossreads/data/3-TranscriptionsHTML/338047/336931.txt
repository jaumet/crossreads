They made things very hard for the Belgiques.  Every man had to raise his hand to a German soldier, &amp; every woman had to speak to them.  They have not got out of the habit yet.  I heard a good yarn about an Aussie who had charge of a few Fritzie prisoners.  An old Belg. picked on one of them &amp; nearly kicked the life out of him.  It appears that he had been staying with the Belg &amp; had illused his daughter.  The Aussie was going to stop him, but when he heard the cause, he decided to let the Belg have a run for his money.<br/>During the day we got into 5th Div motor buses &amp; went south to Beaumont to 5th ADRW.  Half way along the bus refused to go, but on a bootlace being put into some part of the engine, I did not see where, it ran well.  The town of Beaumont is situated on a hill</p>
