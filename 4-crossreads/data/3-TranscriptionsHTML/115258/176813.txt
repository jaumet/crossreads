<p>My dear Mother, I have not written home since the 12th Feb [when I wrote to Fred) and I&#39;m sorry for leaving it so long, but we have been out on a stunt and I have not had much chance before this. There has been no mail in since th 4th so my last letter from you was dated 25th Dec and there and there are rumours round here that a mail has gone down but I dont know whether it is true. Hope not any way. The stunt was wonderful. I cant tell you all about it in this letter, so I&#39;ll just write a short one now and then write you a book on it all as soon as I get time. We were reserves on the stunt so did not do any fighting; we rode from here to Bethlahem, from there out to the Dead Sea - worked our way up along its shores tot he valley of the Jordon and on to Jerico - camped there a day and saaw the Mt of Temptation, where Christ is supposed to have fasted and been temped; then rode back along the old Jerico road to Jerusalem and back to Bethlahem. Then we were given a day to visit Jerusalem and here we are back again now in our old camp.</p>
