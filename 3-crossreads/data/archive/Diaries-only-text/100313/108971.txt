24/11/17 Mt Kemmell
Most men on fatigue during the morning and a great deal of loafing going on ? some of the young officers are very pussy to the old type. Lewis gunners doing live firing into the base of the hill. This pretty little ridge has been a picnic place and on top is a lookout from which you can look for miles over country that is a dead level. After lunch went down to Kemmel village and played the 58 Batt. football. A good crowd. Went down to Col Denehy's mess and found them comfortable. They treated us at the Canteen ? very hospitable and kind. A dull day with bleak cold wind as we came back along the pretty winding road through the hill. Colonel Miles General Staff was round during morning the D.A.D.M.S during the afternoon. A good battalion concert in the evening with plenty of talent in the Cinema Hall. Pte Larry Herz late Blane Holt as stage manager.
