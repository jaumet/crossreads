<p>crash, a gun goes off in the next square.</p>
<p>They put up a barrage now &amp; the sky is full of bursting shells making a grand sight.  Then you hear planes chiefly ours &amp; then you can pick out a hun by the different noise it makes.  I heard no bombs.  One dropped in green park [Green Park] near the Reitz [Ritz ?] making a big hole.  Another outside Charing Cross hospital breaking all the windows.</p>
<p>Plenty of shrapnel &amp; dud shells falling about, policemen with large plackards "Take Cover", motor cars with illuminated signs &amp; all sorts of noises.  I went for a trip in the tube after the show.  9 stations had to be closed down owing to the collection of people refusing to go home, about 1&percnt; of English people the remainder being feros. &amp; dagoes, etc.  Thousands of kids they bring all their bed clothes &amp; tucker with them &amp; the smell pip-pip.  Someone worked out it would cost about &pound;1100 for disinfectant to get the smell of them away.  Hundreds of young fellows who should be fighting &amp; all half scared to death.</p>
