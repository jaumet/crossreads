One day I had a strike at a beautiful place, the Heliopolis Palace Hotel, one of the finest in the world, which is now occupied by No. 1 Aust. General Hospital.  I was on guard there and I took the opportunity of having a knock up.  Needless to say, I didn't know which end of the racquet to hold.

Unfortunately there will be no time to have the new ones taken.  So long Mick.  Look after our little Mummie for the sake of your loving pal.  Eric.</p>
