At Sea. H.S."Karoola."Weather fine and splendid sailing sea - like a mill pond.Played Auction and commenced my entry for the best trench yarn. Travelled for the 24 hours 324 miles  making a total mileage of 1408 miles.With the sea as it is I think we should be at Malta or rather Port Said on the 23rd.
