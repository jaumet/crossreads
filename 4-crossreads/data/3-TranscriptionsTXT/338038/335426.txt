IVwas informed that on account of my warning for overseas being through I would have to remain in camp - I expect they will have your latest letters for me (Nov 28th mail just in) so I must wire Sis in the morning to send them on -I met Charlie Addison here today, brother of Lance - The latter is to first Division in France as Court Martial Officer so I hope to see him when I get across -
