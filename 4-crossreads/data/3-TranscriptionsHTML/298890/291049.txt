<p>21. Thursday<br/>Fog again. Arose to cold miserable house. Glad to get to office. Another trivial pottering day. Nelson S. came after 11 &amp; kept me up to let him in. Thereby little more chill but powerful cough mix. Kept me quiet.</p>
<p>22. Friday<br/>Grey day again but not quite such dense twilight. Got up &amp; got N's breakfast. Ethel appeared with news of her father's death.</p>
<p>23. Saturday<br/>Lunch with Fay B. Judge Mackarness [?], R Dalton &amp; Mark. Then at Albermarle. Sun pierced the fog at lunch time for a little while. Got home at 5.30 &amp; made black velveteen tam.</p>
