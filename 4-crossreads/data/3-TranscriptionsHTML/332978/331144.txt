<p>65 Sept 24th<br/>A special roll call held this mng, by order of the A/Commdt. He addressed us all <strike>&amp; expressed his</strike> &amp; said that the conduct last night of the prisoners confined to cells was not becoming of an Eng. officer &amp; as they had defied him &amp; done so much damage, &amp; taken advantage of the absence of the Commdt, He was compelled to assert his authority by awarding them 6 days cells &amp; canceling their walks for 1 month He was very annoyed indeed &amp; had the prisoners released from cells, especially for the occasion &ndash;</p>
<p>We commenced our walk at 10 am returning at noon, we went up the Hills &amp; thoroughly enjoyed the grand embracing air. It was glorious I had several volunteers &ndash; The scenery is simply magnificent &ndash;</p>
<p>On that return journey about 20 of us missed the main body so we formed up &amp; marched back on our own, without a German Escort. About 100 yds from camp Flipsen appeared on the scene to escort us back &ndash; we were suddenly halted by a German officer, who <strike>roused</strike> was very annoyed with Flipsen because we were smiling &amp; He also said that He was too familiar with the prisoners. Flipsen was reported, to the Commdt, but the whole thing was washed out, the complaint being so frivilous, we afterwards learned that He lost a son last year, therefore He hates we English prisoners &ndash;</p>
<p>Played Bridge &ndash;</p>
