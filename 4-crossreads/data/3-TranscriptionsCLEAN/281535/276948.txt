They stop at the right stage - this is true hospitality as opposed to excess. In the afternoon went out in a car to Mont sur Marcienne to a good Sports meeting and then returned with Colonels Armand and Davis to Hotel Europa for a cognac. At 6.30 commenced dinner with the Mathys and Jamsins. It was a veritable work of art and the wonderful hospitality of the people passes words. I made a speech in French and there were other responses. A wonderfully good & pleasant evening. The hospitality of the people passes powers of description. To bed well after midnight.
