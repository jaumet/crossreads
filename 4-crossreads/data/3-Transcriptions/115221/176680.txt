<p>Dear Miss Clark</p>
<p>I received your letter of the 25/11/17 and up to now have had no time to answer it.  I also got three letters from Miss Warner, all were well when she wrote except her Mother.  I hope she is better by now.  I have just finished a letter to Mary giving her all the latest news.  I have seen my brother.  He was gassed at Bullecourt, and is still in Hospital at Dartford, but he is looking fit and well, but he is tired of it all and wants to get back to the land of the sun.  All the letters I have had, you all say that you have had plenty of rain.  I wish we had some sun here.  I miss it very much.  If I get the chance I will look up Jack Nunn.  If he is a 3rd man I have a better chance of finding him than if he was with another unit.  You say you are sick of the sight of a Macintosh, so are we here, we have to carry either our Big Macintosh cape or our greatcoat.  We have had plenty of rain, up till last week, but the weather has got a little warmer.  I think that this war is near its finish.  I hope it ends very soon, so that we can get back to the land of sunshine.  Thank all at home for their good wishes, I appreciate them very much.  I am going to a School of Instruction tomorrow, for 6 weeks.  I have passed the Bayonet fighting course, and I like the work very much also the Physical Drill, and the Gas &amp; Bombing work.  I will be able to tell you all about it when I get back.  I suppose that you will get warm weather after Xmas, which I hope you do.  I wish</p>
