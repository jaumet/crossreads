  
 He's not a model, far from it but he's got a sense of humour that I understand.  I'm quite sorry for him that he's a Colonel & I'm only a Sergeant as I'm sure he'd appreciate me. 
 See how nicely & causually I bring to your notice the fact I'm a Sergeant.  Of course it's only  acting  but I have the stripes & the authority & as soon as I know the ropes  all  the privileges also the title.  My really truly rank is Corporal but anyhow the pay is the same (net) as a Sergeant's & I can't be a real Sergeant here.  But its near enough.  I'm really very fortunate to be here, my luck is wonderful & hope I do all right but its tricky & one never knows.  I shall have to walk warily & not get dreaming.  I'd like you to see this country, of course its desolate & heartbreaking but to see how it was
