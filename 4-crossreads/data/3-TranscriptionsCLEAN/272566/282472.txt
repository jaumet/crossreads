Monday 29 January
Quiet again during the night so far as wounded were concerned but the guns and shells continued unceasingly.  We still remain in bed until required for duty.  Rations are very poor indeed and far from cheerful - One loaf of frozen bread between 7, a small tin of jam and a tin of pork and beans.  No water obtainable anywhere - all is frozen into ice.  Snow still covers the ground.  Two German aeroplanes brought to earth.
