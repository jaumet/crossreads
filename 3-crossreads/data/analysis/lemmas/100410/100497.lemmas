 Lillian . I would like you to have a littl Roll of Honour for the Swastika and ani inform that you want I will be glad to give you in regard to servic , date or name in full . After be two month in England in hospit and on sick leav am now at Perham Down it is rather cold and not at all pleasant . I have a posit on the staff here so expect to be here for a littl while yet . Whi I put the abov address is that if I have gone to Franc , my letter will reach me direct instead of go to Franc and then back here , it make it much easier if you have an address in England to send your thing . Am enclos a card with a vers on it which will give you some idea of " Perham Down . " To-morrow we are have a day of gift from the Red Cross , and Church Servic which I hope will be a success , weather permit .
