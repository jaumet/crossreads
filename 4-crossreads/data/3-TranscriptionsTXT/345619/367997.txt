 Dear Frank. I have not seen these places and don't think I will, but have seen such lots of foreign people. As we walk along the streets lots of little children run after us and say "Bucksheesh, Bucksheesh," which means they want some pennys to buy something to eat because they haven't got a nice Mum like you have to give them breakfast. Love from Dad
