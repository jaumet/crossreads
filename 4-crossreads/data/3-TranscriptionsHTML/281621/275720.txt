<p>Monday 15<br/>Nothing of importance the last few days.<br/>The clear nights are favourable to bombing on both sides. Fritz comes over &amp; about us last night &amp; to-night he has been very active</p>
<p>Tuesday 16<br/>German Aeroplanes are detected at night by the pecular, irregular throbbing of their engines. The searchlights are not at all quick in picking them up &amp; usually the guns in the vicinity of the bombing object are first to discover him. When they are caught in the light they look very fine.</p>
<p>Wednesday 17<br/>In an aerial battle this morning one German plane came down in flames from a great height.<br/>German planes have been very active during the nights &amp; mornings &amp; they have been dropping many bombs about the neighborhood</p>
<p>Thursday 18<br/>The guns on the front have been very active, both English &amp; Germans</p>
<p>Friday 19<br/>Visit the little coffee shop on Poperinghe Reninghelst road where there was a motley crowd all singing various songs Belgian girls Australians Canadians Chinese of Chinese Labour corps &amp; West Indians. The evening was very merry &amp; the coffee good. A German plane flew very low all over the ground, but it is rumoured that it was brought down</p>
<p>Saturday 20<br/>Poperinghe &amp; the picture show where we saw an Australian Gazette. It is a pity the authorities don't send more of these over to the front to keep the boys in touch with events at Home.</p>
