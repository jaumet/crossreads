<p>miles to the outlying village of Amfreville from which we catch the tram for Rouen. The rain passes over &amp; after an hours walk along the ridge of hills on one side &amp; the Seine on our left. Reach Amfreville at 5 pm    &amp; get a tram almost directly through several suburbs &amp; reach Rouen at 5-45 pm. An interesting trip. Tea at <strike>Soldier's Club</strike> Pattiserie Bleu &amp; the afternoon's expenses about 4 francs. Although making an attempt to write letters, M'ad'mll's constant talk interrupts &amp;  get to bed.</p>
