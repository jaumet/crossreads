<p>9 July, 1916<br/>Sunday  Kantara<br/>I had a good nights sleep, the Transport chaps have fixed themselves very comfortably &amp; I was give a stretcher to sleep on; it was much better than the boards the night previous.  This morning I breakfasted well on steak &amp; bacon &amp; then we came on with two wagons to unload the Kit bags &amp; dump them at the station on Rail Head side &amp; so now, here I am, the kits all in a heap waiting for the trucks to convey them to Rail Head.  The Ser &amp;   [indecipherable] have gone off some where so I have to stand by.</p>
