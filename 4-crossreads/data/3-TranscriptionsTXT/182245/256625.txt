 1917 APRIL 
 20 FRIDAY 
 Fine &amp; Sunny. Cleaning harness 
 all day, &amp; as it got very rusty 
 it took some polishing again 
 We turned our horses out in 
 a paddock to graze, &amp; my 
 word they did enjoy themselves 
 I got three letters &amp; a parcel 
 from Linda &amp; two from Jo &amp; 
 some snaps. I camped 
 in a room in a farm 
 house. The first time to sleep 
 between sheets for months.
