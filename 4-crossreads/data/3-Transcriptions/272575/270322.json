<p>undated<br/>France<br/>My Dear Mother, I will just about have time to catch this mail before it closes, we have been in our present quarters for 16 days, and fritz has not treated us too badly just a few grenades etc, this morning some heavy shells to dig us out, I wish the Russians were all over Germany armed with all the latest and most Diabolical weapons that man has made.   There is a very warm time ahead for Fritz.  I suppose we will get it pretty hot ourselves but Fritz will, get, all he deserves, or I hope he will, last mail in I had letters from Min &amp; one from Dora, - a few days ago I received a card from Cousin D. at Narrandera just before we came here I received your letter and Betts.   The parcel has not arrived yet, it may come along at any time,   About three weeks ago I had a short note from T. Kennett. B.N. to tell me that they have had good rains in the N. West and there is plenty of feed again, if some of this French weather could be sent across Aus. would be absolutely the finest country under the sun,   This is mid summer here, and the hottest day so far has not been worse than a nice sunny day in Spring in N.S.W. I dont think that we will get any hot weather now, and when the winter comes round, well, I dont know what we will do, for I guess that this place is going to be cold, and then our feet will be colder than "Frogs on Ice", &ndash; "That's not a french dish" &ndash; just a metaphor, or any name you like to call it.</p>
