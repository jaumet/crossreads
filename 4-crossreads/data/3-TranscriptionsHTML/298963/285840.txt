<p>16th<br/>Last night passed comparatively quietly &amp; all day we have been undisturbed &amp; nothing has happened worth recording.</p>
<p>17th<br/>Morning quiet &amp; uneventful, a few shells fell at times.  Moved in afternoon to rest camp in a wood near La Bouchigne 4 miles back.</p>
<p>18th<br/>Moved back into line, built new dressing station &amp; made dug outs, at night I got mixed up in barbed wire entanglements, fell into trench &amp; got an iron bar into groin.  Went to dressing station No. 2 F. Amb., got injection &amp; was retained there.</p>
<p>19th<br/>Laid up with wound at field Ambulance.  Met Allebond &amp; spent quiet day resting.</p>
