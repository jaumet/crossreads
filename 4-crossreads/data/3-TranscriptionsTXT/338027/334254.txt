Monday, 11 October, 1915It rained heavily about lunch time for about an hour our dug out did not prove a great success.  Telegrams have been posted that "Four thousand Bulgarians deserted, refusing to fight Russians.  A German transport was sunk by a British submarine in the Baltic and the Allies have had further gains in the Champagne district.  Durnsk is occupied by Hindenburg and there is heavy fighting on the Serbian frontier.  Greece decides to-day her future attitude.
Tuesday, 12 October, 1915We hear that the Canadians that recently landed are doing good work on the extreme left , nothing of any importance happening here, some days there is never a shot fired.  The Y.M.C.A. have opened a canteen in Rest Gully and as we had received some pay I went around to buy some goods but found that it was sold out and the next supply already ordered.  Bitterly cold all day we found the water rather chilly when swimming.
