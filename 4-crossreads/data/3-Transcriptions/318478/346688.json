<p>am glad to say we start for Kilid Bahr the fort on the Peninsular side today &amp; go into camp on the ground.  The long &amp; difficult travelling from London has rather upset my programme and it is a question whether I can get through my Palestine work &amp; get back here before May or June &ndash; but the future is on the knees of the Gods &amp; the weather is taking up.</p>
<p>A <strike>I</strike> very nice man called Vollingony or some name of that kind introduced himself to me here.  He is O.C. education &amp; he was at one time dilettante artist &amp; knew the Canish Crew.  Also was a great friend &amp; admirer of little Savage.  *  His pencil drawings are quite good &amp; artistic.  (Miss Valentine Savage, his model for "The Actress".)</p>
<p>I hope you &amp; Maurice are managing alright &amp; that there will be no difficulty about the separation allowance.</p>
<p>As usual the voyaging has cost me dear &amp; I am looking forward to a while in camp to reimbourse me for Cairo &amp; further expense.  I'll write from Anzac.</p>
<p>Yours Ever<br/>G.W. Lambert<br/>Capt. A.I.F.<br/>War Records Section</p>
