<p>charge all over grease and muck.  Shells falling, men getting skittled, Infantry going up to line, ammunition wagons everywhere, Horsemen galloping about;  And in all this confusion a poor unfortunate rabbit, jumped up, and started to run away towards firing line, followed by a howling mob of Infantrymen.</p>
<p>10-8-1918<br/>Still advancing.  Huns fighting a rear guard action.  Guns again out of range, moving them forward.  Terrific Hun bombing last night.  Terrific was no name, it is simply Hell let loose.  Twelve men wounded in 6th Bty.  18 horses killed in 54th Bty.  We moved from those lines at dusk, to take up a new position.  An 11 inch gun on train complete captured, also two trains load of reinforcements.  The enemy is fighting hard.  Another 8 in. gun with motor wagon attached filled with clothing, pieces of leather &amp; etc. captured.  The Infantry made a raid on the wagon.  Captured field guns</p>
