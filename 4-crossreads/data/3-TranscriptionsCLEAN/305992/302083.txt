  
 20th of Oct. in the Red Sea, 3 days previous to arrival at Suez. Whilst in the Mediterean formally amongst the submarines he had lost his nerves. It preyed heavily on his mind & was no doubt temperory insane during the time whilst crossing the dangerous zone & especially since we saw the Omrah & Leasowe Castle torpedoed & sunk. At that time we were all in the same convoy. Capt. Douton was often aboard of us for dinner & lunch & appeared in the best of health whilst in port. He was well respected by his officers & was the Commodore Captain of the Australian S.S. Co. a man of 65 years of age. We are moored on the banks of the cannel & all the troops are going ashore tomorrow for a long march. All hands on board after a long spell of 3 weeks have had their mail from their friends & relatives. So it eases the monotony having news from home, no matter how old. 
 25th Oct Heavy showers & cool. Temp. 78 the 1st rains we have seen for months. The troops route march having been posponed.
