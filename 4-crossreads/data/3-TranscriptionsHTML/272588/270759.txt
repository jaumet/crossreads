<p>Sunday 25 August<br/>Shelling off &amp; on all day &amp; a few cases but of course taken by the ford except a few this morning &amp; one to-night in the pouring rain.  We are now just to the right of &amp; behind Chignes to the South of the Somme River. Prisoners are now estimated at 2,400,000 unwounded &amp; our casualties were not remarkably heavy for the extent of the stunt, &amp; it was most successful.</p>
<p>Monday 26 August<br/>Fine' to-day &amp; very quiet. We, the Division, is to be releived to-night. Rumours of big offensive all along British line &amp; part of French are current. A big blow is supposed to be struck here to-morrow. Just up the Chignes road is a tremendous German gun which I had a look at to-night.  It is about 15" with very long barrel &amp; its mountings etc. are enormous. Guns are being moved up to here, quite close to the line.</p>
