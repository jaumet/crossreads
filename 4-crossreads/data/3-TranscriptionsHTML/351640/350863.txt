<p>As anticipated in some of my previous letters the first list of wounded Australians that we have seen are published in newspapers that have come from Perth by the last mail, date about the beginning of May.   Letters have come to hand bearing dates as recent as the 9th May from Western Australia, there should have been those by the same mail, of date 2nd May from Sydney.</p>
<p>The accounts of the fighting at Galipoli published in the Sunday Times of Perth are substantially corece [correct] as confirmed by the men who have been speaking to me here after their return from the front. Some were battling for four weeks, others for a lesser time.   It is agreed by all that the Australian fought as of the best, in fact too well because they went ahead so rapidly that they were not held in hand by the officers.   In this way many officers and men were lost who would otherwise have been still with us.   We have not yet seen the names of Col Braund or Sgt. Larkin in the lists but we missed the four first issued.</p>
<p>2-6-15   11 a.m.  Another letter just brought to me from you.  It bears address A. G. London, but it has not been to England.   From you Joe dear, is dated 21-1-15, and has taken all the time to come from Sydney.   Not much use writing about it now, but it is no wonder that people complained when they knew that the fault was with the incompetents in Sydney.  It is always thus with the government employees, a few of them are conscientious but the majority have not that which is ordinarily called conscience.  This I know by long experience.  How a man can take money for services which he does not give has always been to me not understandable in view of the fact that the humblest amongst is told the christ-</p>
