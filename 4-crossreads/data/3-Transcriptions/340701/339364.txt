Another interesting place was the  womens hospital here some very fine looking women were congregated in the small balcony perfectly happy &amp; inviting onlookers to come right in &amp; jig jig [?] &amp; there were some onlookers too because quite a number go in to see it.  There are some fine Hotels  at two of them Sheppards &amp; another   there is a picket to keep Soldiers out.  No decent women or Girl in Cairo will look at a Soldier.  I think our fellows must have played the devil there because even the roughest of the people seem terribly frightened of them.  One incident speaks for itself.  A woman was sitting on the footpath right against  the wall with a Jar of some sort of food which she was trying to sell when she noticed us coming along she took up her jar walked right out in the street waited until we had passed &amp; then took up her old position.  We could'nt have gone near her</p>
