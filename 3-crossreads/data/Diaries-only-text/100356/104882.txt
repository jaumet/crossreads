Slept the sleep of the dead got up at six, fixed up the horses messed about all day leaving for Romani at 4 in the afternoon my horse was settled from the jump but luckily for me held out. The pace was painfully slow for so many men horses were blown out reached Oghratina early in the evening sat tight for 2 hours then saddled up came right through the Bile as usual losing themselves landing out Mahamedere way expecting Tommys to open on us at any minute, got into HQ's at 9 at night to find a good stiff meal awaiting us, turned in straight away.
