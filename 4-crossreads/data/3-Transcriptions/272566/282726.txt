<p>Sunday 9 December</p>
<p>Drizzling rain all day.<br/>Today happens to be Prust's turn for the Corps. run.<br/>Fortunately I was not required for any trips today other than the 5 p.m. Casualty wire which I took to 15th Bgde. Sigs. on foot.<br/>It is expected that we are to move on or about the 15th inst. for a month's spell near the sea coast.</p>
