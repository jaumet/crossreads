<p>One puttee was good, but the other had a number of holes burnt in it.  After Dinner (which was merely a scramble, the reward being a minute quantity of lightning stew) Jack Parsons &amp; I "fell in" with about 40 others ( one lucky beggar being drunk, &amp; made it impossible to "dress" the line) &amp; were marched away to the Q.M. Store, where we were issued with 48 hrs rations, Bread, Jam, Cheese, then we were marched to a heap of tents where we quartered for the night.  Issued with 2 Blankets, which without a fire, just kept us cold enough to prevent us sleeping.  The chats helped to keep our blood circulating.  To improve ? matters a rash broke out under my chin, which the orderly smeared over with some tack like dripping &amp; put a bandage round my head.  This also received some attention from the chats &amp; prevented me from shaving or having a desent wash.  But I must cheer up or this pile of scribbles will read more like a Treatise on "the Minor Horrors of War" than an attempt at a Diary.</p>
<p>Sun.   <strike>NOV</strike>  10.  Sunday which at Home is "the Day". Cold &amp; a drizzling rain.  Bacon &amp; plenty of Hot Tea &amp; Bread &amp; Jam for Break.  Cheered a man up.  After Break. the Serg. Informed us that we were to fall in at 2, &amp; go away with the 2nd div. men to Vignecourt, which was jolly good news.  Jack &amp; I took a stroll back to Becordle where I made enquiries about my pack, but am afraid its "napu".  All my bloomin" souvenirs &amp; personal nick-nacks "gone to pot".  Ah well!  a man must not growl if he's been on the Somme nearly 2 mths. &amp; still in one piece.  When we returned to our Tent, discovered that our gallant comrades of the 5th Div. had disappeared &amp; with 'em all the bloomin' bread, so we had to take a walk into Albert &amp; purchase a couple of Loaves.  About 2 p.m. we were issued with B.B. &amp; B &amp; some Bunghole &amp; marched merrily away to Albert Station.  Having no gear I donned Parsons pack (containing our rations) so as to look as much like a soldier as possible.  Arriving at the station we picked up 7 Reinfts. for the "Hungry 8th".  1 Serg. &amp; 6 men.</p>
