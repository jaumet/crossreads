<p>11/4/16.<br/>Cold and wet. We moved off at 2 P.M., and went and pitched a new camp on the Bolougne Road;  beside a small creek. A new O.C. was attached today a cove named Bailey.<br/>12/4/16.<br/>More rain and wet. The second Battalion came down today and we had to give up the tents we had pitched  it was damn annoying. Located new tents, and slept all the afternoon. There was an issue of Rum the first since I joined; it was good for we are all feeling the cold intensely.<br/>13/4/16.<br/>Had a short parade. A schooner went ashore up the coast last night, 3 of the crew were drowned. The rations are not so plentiful here. The Bread ration is 6 ozs a day.</p>
