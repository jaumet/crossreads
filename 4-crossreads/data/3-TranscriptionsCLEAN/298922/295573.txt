 Alex: Went to the BOURSE or Cotton Exchange to see Cotton sold not unlike our WOOL SALES. The row that is made in foreign languages. Cotton prices are booming & Egyptian Cotton is the best grown in the world. 
 Last night a dance was given at the Hotel & I joined in, the foreign girls all dance beautifully, wear nice frocks but a bit overdressed when they undress for a Ball. Usual English dances Waltz, One Step & Fox Trot -  men in boots & no gloves .
