Sunday 10 June 1917
Going out to SHAM fight our Scouts put up a Jackal, I let a Troop go & we ran him down in great style - the same sort of animal we used to get in S. Africa. Coming home I noticed a Bedouin child cutting up young PRICKLY PEAR & feeding 2 Camels on it. The SPINES were soft but quite strong enough to stick in our mouths - yet the Camel was fat.
Took the Squadron to the Beach & paid them there, the swim did them all a world of good - altho' I did not go to Church Parade I thought of you little Mother.
