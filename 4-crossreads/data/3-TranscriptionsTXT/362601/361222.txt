 F. English lesson in morning. I read all day. We have Book-keeping in afternoon. I get the problem right but no one else. I read all day &amp; night &amp; go to bed early. All the plates slide down the table. It is impossible to enjoy a meal. 
 21 June, Saturday 
 F. The boat gets a horrible list to port. I get pushed from pillar to post &amp; do nothing all morning. Jack &amp; I play cards on deck. I write all afternoon &amp; night others read a little. Lights go out &amp; boys sing. We have preserved ginger for Tea. We roll about a lot. Watch lovely sunset.
