People in Australia "thank Heaven" do not understand what it is like to be deprived of fuel thanks to our warmer climate, the public supply of coal is cut down to the lowest possible limit and a good many other things besides, but still the French people never complain they are wonderfully patriotic, and will sacrifice everything so that they may win the war, that is the spirit of France still today.
For some reason or other we had no sugar in our tea today, this is the first time such a thing has happened to my memory since I have been in the Battalion. Went for a route march this afternoon we usually walk about 2 miles out and then pull up, and have a spell and a yarn for  an hour or so then fall in and march home again.
