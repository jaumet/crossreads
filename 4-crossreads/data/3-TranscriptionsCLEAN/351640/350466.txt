24-12-14 As this is Christmas eve I must speak with some of the Romans about reading over the mass prayers during the morning, and saying some prayers after the evening meal.  They are but a few of the people on board.  The anglicans are in the great majority.  The protesting denominations have a combined service which makes their crowd larger than would be the case had each section a meeting of its own.
We crossed the Equator this morning, and father Neptune, with his trident, is to come on board during afternoon to levy toll from those who have not on a previous date passed through his dominions.  Some officers told me that the line was seen at the point where the ship faced and without mishap crossed it.
As there are some cases of measles on board the Kyarra, many wonder if the authorities at Colombo will prevent us landing, if so we shall have to be content with a view of the island of Ceylon from the deck.
So far we have seen but few flying fishes, these lattitudes are their habitat, it may be that this time of the year they do not disport themselves as frequently as at other seasons.
25-12-14, 9.30 a.m. - You should, at this moment, be about finishing your dinner.  In your mind mayhap - credo - there is thought of me, as with our crowd we are being carried through the waters of the Indian Ocean a few degrees North of the Equator, en route for Colombo.  If you, M. M. Joseph, & your community are as merry as I wish you then there is nothing left for you to desire in that regard.  Blessings from God be on the head of each of you in plenty!
Wonder what did the girls at home think & say of you and me, absent as we are in varied directions from them.
11-45 A.M.  At 11 a.m. I used the book M. M. Joseph gave me again, & read the mass prayers as suitable for the day to the Catholics who attended in the lecture room.
