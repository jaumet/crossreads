<p>town. One or two were bayoneted in the act, though not very badly. To prevent any further rushes being made, we pulled out into the stream about midday, leaving a picket behind to collect all strays. All but one were captured, &amp;   courts martial have been remarkably prevalent on board from that day.</p>
<p>One June the 22nd we left Capetown in a convoy of 5 ships. Lakonia (escort), Demosthenes, Medic, Warilda &amp;  Ascanius. We sailed at daybreak while the table cloth was still on the mountain.</p>
<p>The convoy, since leaving Capetown has travelled in darkness. Imagine the tropics with portholes blocked, doors shut &amp;   windows blinded. In addition to this we ran short of fresh water. However in spite of all discomforts we all preferred this part of the trip to the dreary monotony of the run from Albany to Capetown.</p>
<p>On July 7th we put in at Ports Grande Cape Verde Islands for coal &amp;   water. The island seems to be nothing more than a huge rock rising out of<br/>the sea. Not a blade of grass nor a scrap of vegetation can be seen anywhere. How anybody can live there is beyond my understanding.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to see the niggers fishing &amp;  diving for coins; &amp;   I took some very instructive photographs if they only come out</p>
