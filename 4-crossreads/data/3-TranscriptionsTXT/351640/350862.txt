 Kitty dear:/  The 26th Jany to 1st June 1915, How long?   What should be done to the persons responsible for the delay.  The letters have not been to London.   Find him at your end, then all of you tell him in accounts land deep and long what you think of him and his methods.  Some gentleman, probably who draws his pay regularly, yet between drinks has not time to bother about his work or the requirement of the people who pay him for services which he is supposed to render.   Such people are the curse of our country, &amp; of all countries. Yes Kitty dear it was sad about the Hollingdale girls.  I had not heard of it or read about it till your letters came.   An unhappy episode in the week end trip.  Such things are always occurring for some reason or another.   Do you know why? 
 Sorry the breakfast toast that you made was not for me.  However when we meet again, your toast will be appreciated. 
 Remember me to Margaret, if you see her.  The Jakarand trees here are in full bloom just now they look splendid.   The Poinsettia is a beautiful tree here and its scarlet flowers, in large clusters, are splendid.  There are many of them at Heliopolis and elsewhere.  They are Native to Madagascar.  I wonder are there any in Sydney.  Ask Mr. Maiden?  To the Maidens my kind regards. 
 Glad that you are attending to the fern in front of the house.  The fellaheen here are constant workers on the land, their industry and the water from the Nile produce crops which mean food and money for the 12000000 people who, at the present moment, live with their flocks and herds on the12000 square miles of cultivable land in Egypt.   Wonderful.
