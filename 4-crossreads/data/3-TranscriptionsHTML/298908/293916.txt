<p>11th.  The Major gave the whole boat a short lecture on the gambling evil this morning, says he is quite decided to put it down at all costs &amp; he is right as every right thinking person must admit for a lot of chaps on this boat have not the slightest scruples if they lose their money by gambling, well they can always make it up at someone else's expense &amp; this is what invariably occurs for they will have money by hook or crook.<br/>The sea has been like a millpond the last 3 days &amp; the old ship has averaged 274 miles per day.<br/>Had our first concert on board last night but I did not attend was too busy playing "bridge".<br/>A tailors &amp; barbers shop has just been opened "forrard" these should prove very handy for they are both necessary additions.</p>
