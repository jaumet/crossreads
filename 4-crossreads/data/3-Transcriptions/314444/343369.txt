<p>[Copy of letter from Captain Walter Granleese Boys, typewritten under the letterhead of  W.Boys &amp; Sons, Specialty Drapers of Maryborough, QLD.]<br/>Somewhere in France. 2/8/16</p>
<p>Dear All at Home,</p>
<p>That I am alive to have a chance of writing to you all once again is a miracle.  I have had an experience I never again wish to have.</p>
<p>My Company was ordered into the attack on [blank] [Pozieres] It was a big attack and we had to charge 700 yds. I cannot explain the feeling I had for about 12 hours before the charge. I had sole command of my portion of the attack with 250 men. I had to march on a compass bearing for 3 miles before I got to the debouching point through a perfect hell of fire.</p>
<p>I moved to the attack at 7.30 p.m., and as soon as I began to move I lost all nervousness and felt sure of success. I would like to give you full details of the battle, which was the biggest and fiercest battle yet fought in the whole war, even worse that Verdun they say.</p>
<p>I went with the first line myself and my word my men fought well. They fell around me like flies but on we went as if in a dream while the smell of powder and the din of the guns and bombs etc. nearly turned my head. I reached the Germans' barb wire with <u>"some"</u> of my men, but could not get through and the Hun brought his maxim guns on to us. and we were forced</p>
