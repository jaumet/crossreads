JUNE   THURSDAY 1   1916
Fine & fairly sunny but a strong head wind. We saw more sun than we have seen since we left Australia. The sea too looks a lighter green as if the water was a lot shallower. We had a full dress parade in the morning; and I found the rats had been at my tunic and eaten great pieces out of it. We went on duty in evening  I was on bosuns fatigue so did nothing tonight
