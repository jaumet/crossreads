<p>France<br/>3.5.17</p>
<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>Just a short note before turning in we probably shift at an early hour tomorrow &amp; are at present engaged in a favourite military passtime known as "Standing by." Shortly it means that everyone is made as uncomfortable as possible &amp; wonders what particular piece of France he will be called upon to "hop over". After "Standing by" for about 36 hours a message generally comes instructing everyone to "resume normal conditions." It's a great life.</p>
<p>The weather lately has been glorious &amp; we are all enjoying the training. The hours are very short &ndash; an excellent idea to produce good results &ndash; and the men are in splendid condition &amp; spirits. My horse is looking very fine &amp; is in good fettle. I have got a challenge from the C.O. over a scurry of 2 &frac12; furlongs tomorrow. I think he will win.</p>
<p>I am on Bn Hd Qrs understudying the Senior L Major &amp; have plenty of work to do.</p>
<p>I received a bundle of letters from you a few days ago including several postcards from N.Z.</p>
<p>Very sorry to hear of Keith being wounded, you are having a pretty hard time. I hear he is getting on alright.</p>
<p>Best, love<br/>affectionatey yours<br/>C.R.Lucas</p>
