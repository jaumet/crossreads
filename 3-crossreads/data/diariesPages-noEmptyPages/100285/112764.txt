the other they led us to a big stream 60 yards wide, here was a nice kettle of fish for the only way of getting across seemed to be swimming but before we tackled this I suggested that we should go as far as the next bend see if anything was in sight so we trudged along our luck stuck to us for there we saw 3 men cleaning the weeds out in a punt I put it on them to run us across which they did so ended an adventurous afternoon, but all the same I enjoyed myself we had a jolly good laugh over it on our way home I took a photo of the punt but I don't expect it will be much good for the light was so bad.
Was told this evening by the orderly that I would be going on leave in the morn.
