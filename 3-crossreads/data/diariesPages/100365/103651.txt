of 80 miles. later It is impossible to sleep so we all went to a hill to watch effects. The whole sky seems to be quivering with flashes whilst the searchlights are playing everywhere.Captive Balloon observation posts are sending messages everywhere above the din the Artillery fire one can hear the crackle of Rifle Machine Gun.No doubt there are hundreds of poor beggars going out to it it will be a day that will be remembered for a long while viz 1 2 July attack on La Bassee, ultimate object Lille.The bombardment still continues with un-abated fury on a 90 mile front the sky is lit up for miles.We heard that the booming can be heard quite plainly in Paris. It is a new way of attacking that the British have adopted. The enemy observation Balloons are shot down as soon as they appear consequently they are not able to direct an accurate reply with their artillery.The Aeroplanes are still very active observing is going on which means I suppose a further bombardment tonight. Where it will end I cannot say, but it is practically certain that it is demoralizing the Enemy. Received a letter from
