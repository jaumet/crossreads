I might just mention an extract from the daily paper re potatoes."A waggon of potatoes had just come in done up in 1/- lots it was surrounded, and to give some idea of the struggle, after the fray, on the ground were lying several hats, fragments of blouses & skirts, & a pair of corsets."I agree with the writer. It was Som(m)e struggle.
