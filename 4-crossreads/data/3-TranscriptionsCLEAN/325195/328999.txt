With the exception of a few shells flying & occasionally a warboat opening out everything is very quiet; Our spare time is generally put in playing dominoes, cards or writing; the long promised trip to Lemnos is about to come off within a day or two. Wordsworth who has been bomb officer for some months for the Bde was sent away today with appendicitis. [indecipherable] Roffe his batman was sent away last week, & Campbell took Roffes place
