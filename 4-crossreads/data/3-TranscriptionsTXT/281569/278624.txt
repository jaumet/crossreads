Spent half the night enjoying our contents of the parcels from home, some of the cake was spoilt but everything else was OK, Alec sent a parcel to all of the old boys & good oh too they all appreciated it very much, no parcel from the girl came to hand though guess its alright though.Exercising as usual Mel went down to Teiria today & had a good trip. I renovated my scrap & cleaned her up. Mail was sorted today & I got two - one from Nora & the other from Nell. Nora's was to the point asking me what I had done with Vere's diary, Victorian mail is expected in tonight so hope there's a further addition to my list of letters bed at 9.30, Mustard went to town & bought three violins oh! for some music after this.

Revielle as usual.
Went for the usual ride in the morning & had one gallop which came off successfully for Len, stayed in in the afternoon as Hal had a friend coming up to see him, I went up to meet the train but found that there had been a break down on the line & he would probably arrive about 6 or 7 oclock. All sorts of rumors are afloat as to when the Bediouins are coming it is said that they are in touch constantly at Waddi Natrun & that the whole force is returning from Mersa Matruh & are credited with the skill of being able to give us a good go. Wrote letters home & Nell then retired after accounting for more of our gift stuff.
