 16/7/17 Beaulencourt Morning. General company training with some bayonet fighting to create lust for blood. Afternoon route march round the square Reinecourt &ndash; Villers au Flos. It proved rather a failure as rain commenced and everyone got properly wet before reaching camp again which we did at about 3.15 pm. In the evening orders arrived for attack practice. Walked up to Villers au Flos and did a reconnaissance of the village. Our horses met us at the church and we rode out along the road and almost over to Fremicourt. Very pretty open country not unlike a lot round the Heart at Sale. The wet grass smelt very pleasing and nice. Darkness came on about 9.45 and flashes of shrapnel showed up very clearly from the direction of the firing line. Worrying out at orders until very late and received request from Bde.to drum up a scheme for a bombing stunt for Div. a most worrying day &ndash; anyone can have this job. Now 20 to 12 m.n. Reveille 5 am!!
