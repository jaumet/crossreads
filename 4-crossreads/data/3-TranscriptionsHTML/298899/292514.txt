<p>by bombs etc so that daily the strain on men is becoming greater. Motor lorries in this area have suffered fairly heavily on this particular road they go to within 3 or 4 miles of the line &amp; I have known 8 to be destroyed together. Last night was bright moonlight &amp; several bombs were dropped especially round the [indecipherable] camp. Of course the planes were fired at the luminous "tracer" bullets from the machine guns being a pretty sight. Early this morning there was a heavy bombardment &amp; now as I write this our guns have opened up on Fritz &amp; are shelling him heavily. It looks as if the crowd relieving us tomorrow will have a hopover which is a good sign &amp; if it is as successful as ours we will be doing very well. I don't envy the hun these times.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2nd Oct.  We were relieved today. The 6th took over at 10 A.M. and we went by bus to Devonshire Camp about 5 miles back and what a relief it was</p>
