the enemy's trenches through a periscope, we found him - better, for he had some pneumonia & chest trouble - in an eerie with a glorious view & in good spirits. Everyone seemed full of duty & humour - it is needed of course.
After 1/2 hr of chat we slid down a couple of hundred feet of ropes very comfortably, with niches cut as steps & crawled into this comfortable den - the floor is all stone lumps wh. are hard to sleep on - but the jam spills etc of the 8 of us make it a little softer.
We hope to have some letters soon - they are re-read pretty frequently - -
