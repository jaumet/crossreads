it was the "forwards" day out they rose to the occasion played like clockwork especially Andrews Rusty Egan our little "scrum half". Rusty scored one beautiful try, Carstairs also played a splendid game he was as sure as a bag. This game practically makes us the premiers of the 1st Division, we have only 1 more team to beat they are a soft snap for our combination, I doubt whether there is a team in the Australian Force that can beat them at present, in this competition we have scored 102 points have only 6 scored against us thats pretty good going
Had my hand lanced this morning for it was beginning to look bad it is still very sore painful but the swelling throbbing have all gone.
21st. Beautiful sunny this morning quite Spring like things are looking well Had a scratch match in the Company this afternoon B.Coy. were going to play us but they never turned up so we had a cut on our own, the Dr had a game
