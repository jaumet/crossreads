  
 39 up all-standing. On our way home it was difficult to talk in straight-out English after the laborious chat of the afternoon. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the outing. Monday 26th : We were this morning ordered to Alexis Hafen and on this occasion were accompanied by Dr Byrne who was to confer with Dr Klasten on the native murderously attacked at Dampier Isd. Strange to relate we did not commandeer anything much to the Revd Fathers' surprise I think. We returned to Madang at about 6 pm. Tues 27th & Wed 28 : Routine Days. When at the lighthouse today (Wednesday) I was amused to see their arrangement for striking the time. An iron hoe was hung from the nail of the lantern enclosure & this was struck with a mallet. Previous to this arrangement a cord was attached to a "bully" beef tin; a jerk on the cord caused the tin to strike the iron roof; eight bells became an musical item. A sailor once is a sailor for all time; he must have his ship's bell & his flagstaff; you tell him to starboard his helm; "Starboard it is, Sir", "Hard-a-port"; "Hard-a-port, Sir". Thurs 29th : I am leaving at daylight tomorrow morning for Alexis Hafen, where the "Lili" is to fitted out for the punitive expedition.
