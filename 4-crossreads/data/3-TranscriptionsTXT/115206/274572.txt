 At Beutin Last night &ndash; the weather changed bringing a  transformation of scenery to meet our awakening eye. Beautiful white snow was draped on every natural object, erasing here an ugly mark and softening the dull aspect of our billet. The morning sun's radiance however soon melted the work of the Clerk, and dirtied the footpaths and roads. We worked the usual routine today, and I had a game of footer during the afternoon. Smith and James were very "sore" this morning.
