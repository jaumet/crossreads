<p>I had a very severe Cold. I did not go anywhere, I never in all my life had such an experience. I was not the only one as a large number of the boys were down with it, if that is what they call an English Cold I don't want another one, it was not only on my chest &amp; in my head but my throat was that sore I could hardly Cough. Anyhow today Tuesday I am a lot better. Last Friday I was appointed Corporal in Charge of the Baths, my duties are to Keep the Enamel Baths clean &amp; allot a Certain Amount of Hot Water to each man. This job will suit me until we leave for France when that will be nobody knows although there are Railway Drafts</p>
