 Sunday 22 Plenty of aerial work this morning &amp; Fritz very daringly came very low &amp; destroyed one of our balloons. The division is to be relieved tomorrow &amp; the rumour is that we go to Belgium. This evening many aerial combats took place in which one Fritz plane was destroyed &amp; came down in our lines. Very fine sight. 
 Monday 23 Relieved from the line &amp; march back to Bapaume via Lebuquiere. Beautiful day. 
 Tuesday 24 March back to Pozieres where we expect to stay a couple of days before we go back further. Tomorrow Anzac Day is to be celebrated &amp; we are going to have a 'beano'. Rather a coincidence being at Pozieres. A monument is being erected to the fallen of 1st Aust Division &amp; many to separate battalions.  Beautiful day. 
 Wednesday 25 Anzac Day. We had a dinner in the evening and it was followed by an impromptu concert. Beautiful day. Visit Albert. 
 Thursday 26 In Albert again to see the "Anzac Dandies". Again a beautiful day. Expect to move shortly. 
 Friday 27 Beautiful day. Walk across to Thieperal where a scene of desolation more than any I have seen before, is to be seen. 
 Saturday 28 Again beautiful day. Visit Albert.
