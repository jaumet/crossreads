<p>went off to Opera though everyone told us we could never get in. However a knowledge of French is handy &amp; things worked well &amp; we got an excellent seat &ndash; right in centre of house.</p>
<p>The theatre is a fine spacious building though one has to mount a flight of stairs to reach even the ground floor. There is no promenoir &amp; one must go outside to smoke. The entrance seemed dirty &amp; draughty &amp; the passage &amp; rooms outside the theatre itself cramped one to the extent of being uncomfortable. The interior is large &amp; luminously gilded the roof pointed with figures in the sky &amp; looks real while the chandelier of electric lights is gorgeous. The seating accomodation I should estimate at 2500 about. There are 4 tiers or [indecipherable].</p>
<p>The play was Faust &amp; excellent it was the artists being imported from Opera at Paris. Huberty ([indecipherable]) Valentin (Lestelly an excellent voice) Marguerite (Mareille Berthon). The performance was excellent &amp; the 9f 50 was an excellent investment</p>
<p>In middle we went to Brasserie &amp; picked up Young &amp; Morton gave him a reserved seat After performance concluded we visited Hotel de Paris on [indecipherable] &amp; then to Charley Bar in Peace du Vieux Marche &amp; finally picked up the valiant Cameronian &amp; started off for home.</p>
