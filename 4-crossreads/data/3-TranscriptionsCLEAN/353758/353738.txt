  
 Have got poisoned hands - very sore - our Battallion got some re-enforcements. 
 8/5/15 Came back to our old trenches very cold at night without overcoats 
 9/5/15 Sunday - Comparatively quiet but snipers got several men in our part of the Trenches and the Turkd dropped in some shells which killed or wounded a few - in Trenches

It is reported that a Turkish Artillery Officer and 40 men with 4 guns surrendered to-day. They say they were without water for three days (Note.

 12/5/15 In trenches in our old position
