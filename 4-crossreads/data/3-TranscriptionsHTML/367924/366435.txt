<p>In Hospital<br/>6th December 1917</p>
<p>My Dear Aunt<br/>Just a few lines hoping that it finds you all in the best of health. Well you will be rather surprised to learn that I am in the Hospital suffering from Diarrahia &amp; knocked up generally, as we have had a very hard stunt. I left the Regiment on the 3rd of Dec but I am feeling fairly good again &amp; I expect to get back to the Regiment any day again.</p>
<p>Well I expect you have seen in the papers where that town fell on the 31st October, well we done a thirty five mile ride from six oclock in the night to five oclock in the morning &amp; when Jacko woke up, he found us in behind him, that is the morning the attack started. Jim Ladyman &amp; Sol Green was wounded on that day &amp; a chap that whent into camp with me named Jim Bodkin was killed on that day, our troop was very lucky on that day.</p>
<p>Do you know that our horses had their saddles off for only twelve Hours at one streach of seven days and at another time they had their saddles on for four days without being taken off, and all we had to feed them on was split peas nine pound for twenty four hours with out anything else, and at one time they had no water for fifty four hours at one time and on two other occasions they had no water for forty Eight Hours, so you can see that our horses had a fairly rough spin of it, there is no doubt of it that our horses are marvels after what they have gone through on this stunt.</p>
