<p>He may have a bit of a fight for it, as I learn that the road is closed behind us <strike>the other</strike></p>
<p>Dec 15/15 <u>Matrugh</u><br/>reached here 4 p.m yesterday &amp; am sure the horses are not sorry after the rough time they have had this last few days</p>
<p><strike>People</strike> Everyone says <strike>there</strike> we <strike>has</strike> are lucky to have got through without a scrap &amp; wild rumours were about the camp that we had been cut off.</p>
<p>Every few miles along the track we have seen signs of habitation &ndash; mud <strike>huts</strike> &amp; stone huts &ndash; with mud walled yards</p>
