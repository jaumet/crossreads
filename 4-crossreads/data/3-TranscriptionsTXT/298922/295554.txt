Saturday 1 Sept. 1917
Lost a leaf so put in an October one for today.
Such a Treat my mail arrived. JOE, DAY 8/7/17, MOTHER LAURA, WIFE & sprig of "WATTLE" did I ever quote you some lines published in JO'BURG STAR S.A., "The scent of the WATTLE round LICHTENBURG Oh CHRIST my country again".
Sorry for JOE re enlisting but glad in many ways - "Angels can do no more" & must read letters again.
