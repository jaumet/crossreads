Middleweight Championship so I have won my first tournament;Shand 2nd & Whitney 3rd then met for the heavyweight & Shand knocked Whitney out in one round, neither men could box & Whitney looked very small;  as soon as I cooled down after the contest my arm went very stiff & I could not raise it level with my shoulder & came back to the medical tent & had it dressed before going to bed.
18-7-16Tue 18thWoke up the morning with a touch of influenza,A Taube flew over us again this morning but made off as soon as she saw our plane coming on the scene & dropped no bombs;  Saw James this morning & his leg is pretty bad & goes into the Field Hospital today, & will probably be sent away altogether for a time.
