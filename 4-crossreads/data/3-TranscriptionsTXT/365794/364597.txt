 Sunday 14 July 1917 [1918] Church 9.30 a.m.  A fair no. of our boys came too. &frac12; day &amp; went on Nile.  Gyppo refused to go out longer than 1 hr. (charge Pt. 10 per hour).  Sisters Leed &amp; Peile with me.  At 6 p.m. drove to Geiza gardens then over English bridge &amp; tram back to 31st.  Food is much improved &amp; room cleaned up a little.  Nothing but discontent on all sides in the hosp., never have I lived in such an atmosphere of trouble &amp; immoral behaviour imagined on the part of the Sisters.
