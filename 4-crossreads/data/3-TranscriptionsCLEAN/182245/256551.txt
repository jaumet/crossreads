1917 FEBRUARY
5 MONDAY
Fine & Sunny. Cleaning harness
all morning & out exercising
horses in afternoon. Lieut
Rourke took over the
waggon lines from Capt
Campbell. They are not
loking forward to the change
either as Capt Campbell
had altered a lot since he
came to France. He has
lost a lot of his queeny
ways ect & is more like
a man. Things very
quiet on the line. We
were all called out to draw
ammunition after tea. One
team had to take a load to
the Battery & our team was
the unlucky one. Saw
Warren & the boys up there
& they were all well.
