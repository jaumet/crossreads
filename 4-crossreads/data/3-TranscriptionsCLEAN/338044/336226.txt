  
 with all my trappings take a taxi (now 11 am) & go like fire to Charring Cross & reach the station at 11-20 am. Good-bye London, after all    & I'm sorry to leave. The comfort of being amongst our own people is a great thing to lose. I am nearly tired of this roaming around amongst languages of all nations & vow this is to be the last. Of course I am determined to get to the front this time & after that Headqus will do. A beautiful journey in the train to Folkstone, through miles of grand old English Farms & towns & we take the boat from Folkestone with hundreds of Scotties making their first trip & my last view for some time of Old England. Arrive at Boulogne at 4.15 pm & report to the R.T. Officer who arranges for us proceed to-morrow 12.15 pm. Being alone we stay at the best hotel in the town Hotel du Louvre  & leaving our things here take a look around the town
