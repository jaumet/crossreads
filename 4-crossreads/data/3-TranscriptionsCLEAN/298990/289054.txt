Amiens, Querrieu, Ribemont, Buire 27/10/16 journey and a non stop run passing through the familiar country down to Amiens and noticing near Ailly the remains of an old Roman camp the fosse still being visible.  Thence on to Amiens and passed through its outskirts.  Many French soldiers billetted here and I saw some blacks dallying with white women.  A few of our Indians about - heard it said there are some souvenir Indian picannins round about.  We had a short halt just outside Amiens and a pretty fresh faced girl came along selling cakes.  The men were urinating all round her but she took no notice - the French care little for these things.  We now passed on through Querrieu passing through some delightful green forest and meeting a great deal of transport.  Our convoy swung along like a long train.  The country now began to appear war stricken and there were crowds of Hun prisoners under guard at work on the roads.  Our motors dumped us at Ribemont - we had enjoyed our motor ride.  Formed up on a piece of waste land and having met a guide, we pushed off towards Buire.  It was a short march but very muddy and we passed Germans sweeping the mud off the road.  Entering the village of Buire we found that we had to go into close billets and have the maximum of crowding with a minimum of comfort. H.Q. not too bad.  The whole Brigade is billeted in this village.  Rain commenced as soon as we got under cover.  It is very funny to hear the boys talking alleged French.  Had a glass of a liquor called grenardine  - a syrupy thing made from pomegranates and a cup of coffee made by Madame.  French people can make coffee.  Turned into bed, and slept very soundly.
