<p>our military imbecility.&nbsp; In the office we find blacksmiths or laborers, endeavouring to do accountants work.&nbsp; Accountants are probably employed on road-making or some other job for which they are as unsuited.&nbsp; Right through the whole piece you find the same thing, resulting in a hopeless state of systematic muddle.&nbsp; No one knows anything, nothing can be found.&nbsp; All is chaos, the wrong men occupy the wrong jobs, and yet it would seem so very simple to remedy.&nbsp; You go through the whole system of studied stupidity and then you arrive at the doctors and dentists and find that they are the only ones who really understand the job they are doing.&nbsp; There must be some reason for this, I suppose the authorities really could not think of anything that would not suit them.&nbsp; However, the fact remains (to the credit of the authorities? ?) that the doctors did attend the sick and the dentists the teeth or lack of same.</p>
