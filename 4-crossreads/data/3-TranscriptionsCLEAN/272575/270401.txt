that I had a letter from J. Howell.   he was up at Salisbury, and expected to leave for France at any time   They were to be sent over to the Training  Base over there, it is near Bologne.   I may manage to meet him over there.   So far I have not heard from Harry.    I will have to write to Horseferry Road and try to find out whether he has landed here yet.A couple of days before I left Wareham it started to snow, then rained a little on top of it and at night froze hard.   The Place was lovely it was so slippery that we had a job to walk about, several of the men came down and hurt themselves    I had one fall and jarred my back but it is allright nowThe Road from Wareham to Dorchester was very Pretty.   The fields on either side were white with snow, and the hedges were partly covered but it made walking tiresome for in some Parts the Roads were very slippery and in others rough, but I had plenty of time so it did not matter.   I did not see anything worth writing about in Dorchester, as it was dark when I arrived there and I was only there for one hour.   I would have liked to stay there for a couple of days as it is the Principal town in Dorset, and has some queer old buildings in it.
