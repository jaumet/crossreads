  
 rumour over here that it was instigated by German agents and financed by German money.  The government appear to have made a very firm stand and won through splendidly.  The feeling against the I.W.W. people does not however seem to be sufficiently hostile as yet. 
 Over here, the war goes on just the same.  There is a general feeling of optimism.  Of course the Italian reverse is rather serious, and postpones the final issue for a bit but otherwise things seem to be going well. 
 We have been right in the thick of the show up here and have managed to keep the flag flying.  It has been very interesting. 
 I like this work better than G.S.O. 3 [General Staff Officer 3rd Grade].  The human element enters far more into it, and one sees far more results for the energy expended.
