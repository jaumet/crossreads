<p>ridiculous ideas some men have.  Some wont vote at all. Others object to a party from the presence of one man, one man put a cross in each square thus making an informal vote, he did this in order to say he had voted but yet begrudged his vote as likely to influence either candidate or party.  No event I know of shows man in such a ridiculous light as an election the greater the issue the greater the bungle he will make of it.  Tis impossible for women to abuse the privilege of the vote more than the men do now, I would give it them every time.  Judging from what one sees, the Ministerial or Nationalist party will gain a substantial majority.  Let us hope so &amp; thus redeem the honour of the country, giving Hughes the opportunity of making a name unique in the Annals of Australian politics if not in those of the Empire I believe he has it in him.</p>
