Rode over to St Vast and spent the morning there. Then rode on to Flessells and had a café with Georgette and her aunt. The kid cried horribly when I left poor little 17 year old. These French are so demonstrative. As her aunt says it is something to say that at least someone weeps for you! A very prettily situated village this but now all the leaves are off the trees. What a life to live here – always doing nothing. A long ride home in the dark. The entertainment takes place on 22nd at Vignacourt. Had a long argument with Georgette's uncle about Clemenceau. Foch & Co.Every Frenchman finds a reason for our victories in the unity of Command. McColl BM. & Colonel James are back from English leave today. Much milder in temperature today.
