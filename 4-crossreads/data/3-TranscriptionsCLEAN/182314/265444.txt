  
 [Indeciperhable] Platoon  [Non?] commissioned Officers 
 X Lowther. 
 Platoon Sergeant. He is a man well up in his work & well able to detail [indecipherable] to his men. With an old [indecipherable] man over him, He has good control over them but this control disappears when he is left to himself. He is keen on doing well. At times I have found him unreliable, generally this is not so. He is slightly superior to the general run of N.C.Os [in comportment?] at present he is at the officers [block?] 
 X Thompson. Sergeant. 
 Absolutely incompetent. Too young no personality, no control, & unreliable. 
 X Finlay. Corporal. 
 Trustworthy, well educated & reliable has a good knowledge of his work & fair control over men. His youth & his absence of a strong personality are the only blemishes in a first class N.C.O.  can safely recommend him for promotion. 
 X Jones. Corporal. 
 Trustworthy & reliable, has a fair knowledge of his work & fair control over men. With a little more experience he will prove a most useful N.C.O. in every respect. 
 Andrews. Lance Corporal. 
 Trustworthy, conscientious & reliable an excellent N.C.O. with good control  could well fill a position of higher rank. 
 Masterton Acting Lance Coproral. 
 Trustworthy, most conscientious & reliable [indecipherable] a fair knowledge of the work of an N.C.O. but very keen. recommend his rank be continued.
