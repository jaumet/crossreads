Afterwards visited the more modern Blue or Coronation Mosque  This is very beautiful inside, even the walls &  roof being inlaid with 22 ct gold    &  the pillars of pure ivory & ebony. 365 lamps hang from the ceiling (one for each day of the year) as in Sultan Hassan Mosque. Thick carpets adorn the floor, so one walked noiselessly  We put large felt  slippers over our boots on entering. I visited the Citadel now & inspected the walls, old guns & armoury of Napoleon's time. From the top of a minaret I had a fine view of Cairo laid out before me, like a mighty city dumped down in the desert.  One would not think it's interior was overrun by trams etc. Before leaving I had a talk with some of our wounded Sikhs &  Ghurkas, one of whom exchanged handerchiefs as souvenir
