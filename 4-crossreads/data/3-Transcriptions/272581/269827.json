<p>July<br/>wanted. The   <strike>fi</strike> First Battalion took the two first lines &amp; "C" &amp;  "D" Coys of the third took the third line &amp; dug in at the edge of the village of Poziers on the morning of the 23rd. Things were very quiet all day sunday &amp;  half of monday &amp;  so gave us a chance to dig in but during the afternoon of monday Fritz opened up a bombardment which lasted all that night till about nine o'clock next morning when it lifted &amp; it was then that they gave a half hearted <strike>bombardment</strike counter attack &amp; we drove them back &amp; dug in the far side of the village &amp; held it till we were relieved on the Wednesday &amp;  it was what we needed to for we were nearly seven days without a wash shave &amp;  sleep &amp; very little to eat &amp; we were a sorry battalion when we lined up for roll call. It was late in the afternoon on the 26th when we bid good bye to the firing line &amp;  moved back behind Albert's &amp;  bivouacked  till next morning &amp;  the first thing I received when we were settled down was a letter from mother &amp;  Belle &amp;  I think it the best present I ever received to know that all at home were well after coming out of such a stunt. The next morning 27th we moved back past Warloy to a big rest camp at Vadencourt but only stayed there till the following night when we marched to La Vicogne &amp; then next day marched to Bonneville but only rested till next morning &amp;  then moved to Pernois where we remained for over a week training &amp; it was great to be away></p>
