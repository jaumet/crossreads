 Friday 26 October 1917. 
 Taube flew low &amp; bombed us. 
 Casualties&nbsp;2 camels &amp; 1 native by one bomb thrown at the H Qrs &amp; Brigade officers. It landed 30 yds from them but they were uninjured although 80 yds away 1 camel was killed. Fantasis (water) near were riddled with holes. 
 Rifle fire altered his course &amp; thus other bombs fell in open country. 
 Taubes visited us again during day and bombs had no effect on our position (We have all got &quot;Taubitis&quot; now) 
 On picquet all day and night. Got several pieces of bomb in bomb crater. 
 Visited the old ruins &amp; took snaps of graves and some skeletons that were taken from an ancient well.
