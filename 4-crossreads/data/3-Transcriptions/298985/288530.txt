<p>This camp was near Arbinins &amp;   Rosiers.<br/>Did not feel the march so much to day.  Left a flannel shirt &amp; pr of sox behind to lighten the load.</p>
<p>Monday 12th<br/>Were told to make our dug outs splinter proof &amp; be ready to move off at 10 minutes notice. We found ours was much to narrow to be cumfy so have widened it at one end &amp; can now sleep side by side. Did not get much sleep last night Our guns did a lot of firing &amp; the hum of the planes was almost contineous. Jerry dropped plenty of bombs the closest about 500 yds away. Bits of dirt kept falling on us &amp;</p>
