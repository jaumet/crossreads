1916   SATURDAY 13   MAY
Cold and showery all day  Our battery was on duty but they took the left Section for guard ect. I was mess orderly, and was also grabbed for fatigue - carrying flour Spuds, dry rations ect - from fore hold to saloon gally. We called in at Port Phillip about mid-day to pick up two ship's quartermasters who had deserted also to drop our mails. A [?] torpedo destroyer took the mails. We ran into dirty weather in evening off Cape Otway, cold and rain and westerly gales.
