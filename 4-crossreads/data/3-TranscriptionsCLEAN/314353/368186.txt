October 1349.Greyness over the skies, and the three trees by us like faint etchings, faintly and timidly drawn and partly coloured yellow green and brown red.
Now the rains heavy, and the only light blown candles.
50.Poems, Ralph HodgsonTime you old Gypsy Man.
Time you old gypsy manWill you not stay,Put up your caravanJust for one day?
All things I'll give youWill you be my guest,Bells for your jennetOf silver the best,Goldsmiths shall beat youA great golden ring,Peacocks shall bow to you,Little boys sing,Oh, and sweet girls willFestoon you with may,Time you old gypsy man,Why hasten away?
Last week in BabylonLast night in RomeMorning, and in the crushUnder Paul's dome:Under Paul's dialYou tighten your rein -Only a moment,And off once again:Off to some cityNow blind in the womb.Off to another,Ere that's in the tomb.
Oct. 13"The Song of Honour"
I stared into the skyAs wondering men have always doneSince beauty and the stars were one,Though none so hard as I.
It seemed, so still the valleys were,As if the whole world knelt at prayer,Save me and me alone:So pure and wide that silence wasI feared to bend a blade of grass,And there I stood like stone.
I heard the hymn of being soundFrom every well of honour foundIn human sense and soul:The song of poets when they writeThe testament of BeautyspriteUpon a flying scroll.The song of painters when they takeA burning brush for Beauty's sakeAnd limn her features whole.
The song of men all sorts and kinds,And many tempers, moods and mindsAs leaves are on a tree,And many faiths and castes and creeds,As many human bloods and breedsAs in the world may be.
The song of each and all who gazeOn Beauty in her naked blaze,Or see her dimly in a haze,Or get her light in fitful raysAnd tiniest needles even,The song of all not wholly dark,Not wholly sunk in stupor starkToo deep for grasping Heaven.
