<p>there.</p>
<p>Went after tea to a <strike>new</strike> revue "Push &amp; Go" which was wonderfully staged at the Palace Theatre. London playhouses are enormous in comparison to ours &amp; this one was most lavishly decorated inside.</p>
<p>After the show, just <strike>for</strike> to see what the theatre suppers are, we went to Claridges which is perhaps the most noted Cafe in the city and here we had a supper, which was wonderfully served and as extensive in it's courses as a midday dinner would be. The bill was in keeping with the place and just as alarming so we have decided not to venture there for some time yet, to come.</p>
<p>October 9th: -<br/>Fine &amp; very cool all day.</p>
<p>Caught the 10 am train to Epsom, where at the famous Grandstand Hospital I saw the brother of my chum, Leo Drinkwater. He was doing splendidly &amp; recovering from a severe wound which had kept him in bed 13 weeks.</p>
<p>Epsom is a pretty place, very picturesque and it's racecourse wonderful. The Grandstand &amp; the King's own stand have both been converted into hospitals and they are kept in splendid condition.</p>
<p>Back at Waterloo at 6 pm and with Reg, after tea witnessed a performance of "Romance" a pretty piece staged at the "Prince of Wales" theatre. Night wet, dismal &amp; very cold.</p>
