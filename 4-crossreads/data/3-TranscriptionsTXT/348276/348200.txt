 [Transcriber's notes: John Macquarie Antill, the son of a grazier, was born on 26 January 1866 at Jarvisfield, Picton, N.S.W. He was a professional soldier.  He saw action in the Boer War and on the outbreak of the Great War was appointed Brigade Major with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade which comprised the 8th, 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments, with the rank of Lt. Colonel. The brigade fought at Gallipoli as infantry and Antill took temporary command on 20 September. Following evacuation the Brigade returned to Egypt and he was promoted Temp. Brig. General on 1st Jan 1916. 
 This diary is a typescript copy of the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade War Diary written by Lt. Col. Antill in his position as Brigade Major.  It begins on 27th August, although he wrote the Brigade Diary from early May. His entries continue until 20th March 1916 after which they are written by another person.  The diary is written from a more personal perspective than is usually the case with Brigade and Regiment War Diaries. It includes comments critical of the organisation in respect of men sent away sick, p19; lack of replacements following heavy losses suffered by Brigade and no relief for men continuously in trenches for long periods; lack of basic amenities p31; lack of adequate shelter and clothing in winter.  It also includes some criticism of British troops, p8 and p34. 
 John Antill was in command during the action at The Nek on 7 August which resulted in especially heavy losses suffered by the 8th and 10th L.H. Regiments.  Published accounts of the action have generally blamed the Brigade Commander, Brig. Gen. F.G. Hughes and his deputy, Lt. Col. Antill, for persisting in the attacks in the face of superior firepower from the Turks]
