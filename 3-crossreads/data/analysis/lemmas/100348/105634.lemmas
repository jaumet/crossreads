 29/10/16 . Move up to the Reserv Trench in front of Delvill Wood . There has been fierc fight in this wood , even now it is heap with corps . The mud here is sicken ; I found a " Tommi " bog in it , and it took four of us half-an-hour to get him out . He was in a shock state of exhaust ; but game enough . I marvel how this citi bred Englishmen stand it . The flash of our gun illumin the whole sky , we are veri strong in artilleri now . The German line are visibl from here ; at night his rocket rise continu , Red , Green , White , and a beauti yellow one we call " Golden Rain" . I have a veri wet home here , I 'm afraid it will fall in on top of me soon .
