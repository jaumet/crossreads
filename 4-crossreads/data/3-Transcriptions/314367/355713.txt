<p>Nelson &amp; I went to the beach of an island about 3.30 pm &ndash; We carried an ancient shot gun with which I secured a pigeon &ndash; a fruit pigeon &ndash; of a species not known to me &amp; Nelson a shining starling &ndash; I took both of these to the Ship &amp; skinned them &amp; made two fair specimens to show Rawdon &ndash;<br/>Pigeons have their home in this <u>Australian</u> region &ndash; Also the Shiny Starling &ndash; We shot a flying fox which however &ndash; we did not recover &ndash; Even dead they hang by their hook like claws to the top of a tree. We had a jolly tramp &ndash; I saw a screw pine (Pandanus) new to me &ndash; It had leaves like an agave of the very darkest bronze green I also got a few fine Polypodies &ndash; of the climbing sort.  We went to a village &ndash; Saw a native with a stump for an arm &ndash; dynamiting fish he said &ndash; I saw a native church &ndash; the worst in the world &ndash; the rudest &amp; crudest &ndash; A pulpit only in it made of a few rough boards &ndash; nailed together anyhow &ndash; The natives sit on mats -</p>
