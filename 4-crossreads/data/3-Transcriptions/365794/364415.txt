<p>Monday 15 January 1917 [1918]<br/>Once again we begin Monday &amp; now Reid (orderly) has gone thank heaven! - rude &amp; no conscience.<br/>&frac12; day &amp; went Pyramids, saw Sphinx for 1st time at sunset &ndash; there that mystic face is looking out towards the sunrise as it has looked for 6000 B.C. (so guide says).  Palm read &amp; after sitting down all of us in the sand &amp; putting 5 piastres in the line drawn he says, long &amp; happy life &ndash; life gets better from now on.<br/>A gentleman (2) love you, etc. &ndash; marry in about 7 months, go home in six.<br/>All the same old take but while he tells it, I adore the sunset sky.</p>
