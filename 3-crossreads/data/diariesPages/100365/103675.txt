the front one can only wonder how on earth so many million men horses are fed. We are now feasting our eyes on the Late Lord Kitcheners marvellous organizing powers.I am feeling pretty tired so will feed my horse turn in.

Had a most interesting pretty trip today. I left camp after riding through numerous fields got on the main road to Amiens. After riding for close on an hour I came to a pretty but deserted village called Havernas. This place was raided by Germans until recently is on one wing of the Amiens Salient hence its desertion by the people. There are several chateaus there with very large wooded estates no words could describe their beauty.I was quite close to the Battle Line here needless to say my ears are still ringing from the ear splitting crashes of the big shells.The Offensive still continues the gain is on our side although the Germans are making super human efforts to try stem the advance but the break will soon come we are all convinced.The weather still continues fine. My horse is looking a perfect picture now
