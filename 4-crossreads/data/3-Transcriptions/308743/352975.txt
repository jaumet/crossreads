<p>25 May 1915<br/>Tuesday Triumph sunk</p>
<p>Nothing happened during the night but the little gun kept them busy. The Turks have partially sapped Quinns &amp; we have counter sapped &amp; expect it to go up about 5 pm. At 11.45 the Triumph was torpedoed &amp; sunk by a Austrain submarine off Shrapnel Gully. She took 35 minutes to sink &amp; then she went down head first. We watched her from up on Quinns &amp; saw the water close over her, 400 men perished on her, the same sub had a go at the Vengeance but luckily missed. At 2.30 5 destroyers had [indecipherable] the sub up &amp; were firing at the periscope but we don't know with what result. At 5 all arms stood to [indecipherable] when the Saf was fired everything went OK. I then had to go through Death's Alley to meet our chaps from Cape Helles but no trawler is to be allowed in tonight so we after having a swim returned. Our howitzers shells seen passing over us all day</p>
<p>26 May 1915<br/>Wednesday 41 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>All the wireless chaps arrived back today &amp; Hal Letch with them expect remainder of the lads with us in a day or two. Turks very quiet today only a rifle fire exchange along the whole front. Went for a dip this afternoon &amp; had another bath of shrapnel. The snipers up the razor got 2 [indecipherable] opposite HQ this morning, our artillery fire very [indecipherable] especially the 6" howitzers I think it is done more to deceive the enemy. Aeroplanes are all round us at 4 pm &amp; start to drop bombs on the enemy these bombs weigh 112 lbs &amp; explode with some force Meet Div Sig chaps &amp; exchange experiances. Went up on the job of locating a hidden battery of the enemy at 6, but they only fired one shot just enough for us to spot we got the Mountain Batty to put a doz rounds into them &amp; as they havn't spoken since we must have accounted for it. Weather has taken up a good deal &amp; things are much easier. Turkish prisoners building dugouts &amp; making roads at the Base while we were bathing. Bed at 6.30 expect an attack at 4.</p>
