 after about a week or so during which time we were kept at work each night in three reliefs digging more trenches down to where there was a well where a lot of men had got killed while waiting their turn for water so a trench was dug to give the water carriers a better chance as the water supply on the Peninsular was bad all the water had to be carried, half a Pint of water was each mans allowance each day for all purposes some days we got a Pint!
