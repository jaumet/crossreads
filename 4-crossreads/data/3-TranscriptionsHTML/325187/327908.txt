<p>Before snatching a few minutes sleep must write my notes.<br/>We are off again at midnight neither Horses nor men have recovered from our Past Stunt, but we must do it.<br/>Its these damned aeroplanes give us no rest over when we are in Camp  Half the men ride along in their sleep even coming home on Monday but it's the Old story of Soldiering &ndash; a fight is nothing it's the privations that cut a man up.<br/>Next letter enclose a few strands of Khaki Thread the Housewife you made me is now empty of thread I'm no big sewer but it was most useful.</p>
