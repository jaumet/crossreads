<p>scramble that followed. Off went equipment &amp; rifle, and then the people would have seen their Aussie of leave-times.</p>
<p>No time was lost in getting to the tables, though the organisation was lost, and between mouthfuls we saw a little chap, bubbling like a volcanoe, mount a small platform, and of course we stopped eating to cheer, and to give our 'Billy' a hearing. Quite a few must have waited to finish mouthfuls, for the cheering &ndash; though loud &ndash; was long &amp; spasmodic and I heard very little of what he said. But it must have been right, so as he seemed to be finished, we banged tables etc and cheered again.</p>
<p>Then we split up and went off to fill in the rest of the day. It passed uneventfully as far as I was concerned, and tired out, went back to the billet fairly early. We landed back at Upwey after midday on the 26th and resumed camp life there till the long-looked for furlough period came along.<br/>For the first time in my military career I found it hard work to dodge fatigues and guard, but somehow I missed them all. Wonderful indeed are the works of a wheelbarrow, but it is by means &ndash; even so simple &ndash; that such evasions are best carried out.</p>
<p>Then on the Monday off we went again with great rejoicings &ndash; and many empty pockets &ndash; to spend our last leave in England. For my part England only then became interesting. It was certainly the most enjoyable leave I spent there.</p>
<p>Saying good-bye to the large circle of acquaintances I had made around my 'home' place was not the least welcome diversion. They were of the class that I believe will always keep England back, and I was honestly glad to see the last of them and their silly ideas &amp; prejudices. There are people in Australia who would judge the Irish Question &ndash; one of my pet themes &ndash; in the way of one I met there, but not mad enough to look at everything else in</p>
