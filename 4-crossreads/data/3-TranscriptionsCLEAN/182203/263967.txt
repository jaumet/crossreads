Did I ask you for Agnes, Bessie &  Vi's address. I thought I had them. Tell them I have not forgotten them but will write, give them my love. It is very hard to write on board ship, one cannot get a comfortable corner.I did not go to early Communion but must go to church parade. Hope you are all well  & that I shall soon receive letter from you all. What was the Photo like? Has Moth & Eddy had their's taken. Fondest love    &  kissesFromYour loving daughterEdith
