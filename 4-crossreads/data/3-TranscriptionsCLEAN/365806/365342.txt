  
 "Birralee" Wolseley Road Point Piper, 29th Nov. 1916 Dear Judge Ferguson, 
 I have just received from my son (Lieut. Harold Barlow) by last mail, two Photographs taken on board a Troopship on the way to Marseilles, my son & your poor son being in the group; my boy has asked me to send these photographs to you as he thinks you would like them, being the latest Captain Ferguson had taken. 
 Harold tells me that he was sitting next to your poor boy, in the Dug-out, when he was killed (instantly) & he was himself knocked out & wounded by the same shell; he speaks very highly of his late C.C. & says he was one of the best.
