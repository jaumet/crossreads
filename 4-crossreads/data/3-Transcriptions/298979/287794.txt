The thickness of the concrete was such that when the door was shut only a very heavy shell would have had any effect on the Huns inside the "box". From this a stairs led to the dug out below, 20 feet deep, where a large number of men could be held in readiness for action.</p>
<p>Nothing whatever could be seen from the opposite side of the road, to lead any one to suspect that a Battalion of men could have been mown down along that road &amp; not a single Hun likely to be touched except a possible haphazard bullet by chance passing through the very small slit.</p>
