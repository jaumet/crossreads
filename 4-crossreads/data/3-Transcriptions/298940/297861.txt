<p>Ypres &ndash; Comines Canal Sector<br/>We travelled by motor lorries from Lec Bois to Vermozille, where the 3rd now have its headquarters at an A.D.S. This place is due  south of Ypres, and leaving Vermozille (only a name) &amp; beginning to cross the desolate treeless ground going up to the front line, Ypres comes into view on the left, as a wonderful but awful picture of ruined churches &amp; heaps of stone. On the road up we had our path shelled ahead of us by shrapnel &amp; high explosive, but we got through safely.<br/>Eight of us are at a regimental aid post about 400 yds behind the trenches</p>
