off the wharf, through the town of Southampton, to the railway station  Here, again, we are accorded a great reception & for the first time in 9 months I find the people around speaking English. It is really great to be "home"  The town of Southampton is rather pretty but small, but undoubtedly English    & that's what counts. Left at 11-15 am for Waterloo Station, London. Passing good old country towns  pretty villages, fields & farms on the way, all green & we have a great day to wit. Soon see Electric trains bustle everywhere & London have in sight  my first view of it being Westminster & Houses of Parliament. Marched straight to Hdqus, Horseferry Rd, obtained passes, a cup of tea etc, gratis, at the Anzac Buffet (a charming little place) & have forth to see London after receiving 1 in pay on a/c. Take a bus ride to Muswell Hill, Highgate (long ride)    & pass St Pauls; Strand; Lincoln's Inn; Bank of England etc en route. Most interesting. Take tube railway back to Charing Cross.  Put
