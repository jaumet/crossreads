<p>Paris<br/>10/3/17<br/>"make so much stupidite"    French officers salute each other in passing which is much more comradelike than the English way of passing along ignoring one another.  It must be lovely among these avenues and paths in Spring when the trees are all green.  The place is shorn of half its beauty under bare poles.</p>
<p>We returned from our walk and had a long talk and then I went out for lunch meeting Matthews and some of the others.  We decide to lunch together and went to Pruniers which is easily the noisiest cafe I had seen.  Lunch was too heavy (commencing with a dozen oysters) &amp; culminated in wasteful excess of roast chicken.  Evidently a popular place with Russian officers of whom there were quite a number and all had ladies with them.  Extraordinary beauties are most of these and the acme of daintiness.  At 3 o'c returned to the Continental and with my friend went up Boulevard des Italiens and had an amusing living photos taken in 3 poses by an awfully comical old Frenchman whose explicit instructions &amp; gesticulations were as comical as his appearance</p>
