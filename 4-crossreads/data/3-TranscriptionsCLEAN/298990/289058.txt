  
 Buire-sur-Ancre, & Amiens Picardy 1/11/16  being put on the graves of "les braves" who have died pour La France.  The French soldier carries an equipment which seems much lighter than ours and  can be cast off easily.  A spare pair of boots is carried one boot of each side of the pack.  Coming into the Rue des Trois Caillons we commenced shopping and kept hard at it.  It was delightful to see the daintiness of the French shop - girls  - so vivacious and attentive and withal so neat and dainty.  In accordance with the usage of these Continental countries, baths are rarely indulged in by the people but the women keep themselves to all outward appearances and clean as new pins.  The effect of no baths is noticeable now and then is the sweaty smell of armpits and I think it is for this reason that scents are so freely used by them.  Amiens is essentially a French city.  All the troops in the streets are the piolus in their horizon blue uniforms.  The officers look extremely smart in their well fitting tunics and gold braided kepis.  All ranks wear their medals the Croix de Guerre and Legion of Honour are common and look very well.  Trams running along the streets, dainty women passing and all the comfort of civilised life emphasised - and 30 miles away poor devils grope in the mud for one another and die in the rottenness of decaying flesh.  To Goeberts, a cafe near the Banque de France and ordered lunch.  Tried to get some frogs but there were none on.  This fine place much frequented by the French and British officers.  Dined in epicurean style on French dishes
