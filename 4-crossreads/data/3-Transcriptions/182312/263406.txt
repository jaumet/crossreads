<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -2-</p>
<p>fall in at 3.30. &nbsp;As usual with detachments leaving during the</p>
<p>night all officers of the Camp turned out to see us off despite the</p>
<p>cold which in Egypt, even in Summer makes early rising unpopular.</p>
<p>Camp was left at 3.45 and we entrained at a Siding a mile of two</p>
<p>away, shortly after 4.30. &nbsp;The train consisted of 30 open coal</p>
<p>trucks which had to accommodate about 30 men each as, with other</p>
<p>units out detachment consisted of about 900&nbsp;men. &nbsp;The train did not</p>
<p>leave until 7 o&#39;clock so we had to spend a couple of hours in the</p>
<p>cold darkness in the open trucks. &nbsp;No special provision was made on</p>
<p>the train for Officers, so we had to satisfy ourselves with the</p>
<p>coal trucks. &nbsp;The country between Cairo and Alexandria opens ones</p>
<p>eyes to what irrigation can do. &nbsp;The whole country side as far as</p>
<p>you can see is a brillint green - crops of every kind growing in</p>
<p>profusion. &nbsp;This particular district is Nile Delta country and is in</p>
<p>addition watered by numerous canals, cross ditches etc. &nbsp;The method</p>
<p>of Agriculture is very primitive - same as has been in use for</p>
<p>thousands of years. &nbsp;The plow is just a wooden structure with a</p>
<p>single wooden spike for tearing up the ground, the reaping is</p>
<p>done with a hand sickle - generally by the women and children,</p>
<p>mostly the children, the women being used to carry the loads into</p>
<p>the markets. &nbsp;Women are more plentiful and cheaper than donkeys or</p>
<p>camels&nbsp;so their labour&nbsp;is availed of to the utmost, and I must say</p>
<p>that in all the places I have been I have never seen a better car-</p>
<p>riage or a more graceful walk than is possessed by these Egyptian</p>
<p>women. &nbsp;The reason is easy. &nbsp;The load which is carried on their</p>
<p>head is in a basket about the size used a a clothes basket on</p>
<p>washing days in Australia, and this is heaped up with cloves or</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
