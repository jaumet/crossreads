 Alex: Still waiting. 
 Went for a long walk to an old fort built before even the Romans came, I'm not much at Antiquities but these places are of interest. Alexandria is a very old seaport of the Mediteranean. Two boats little one went today but only  duty  men go in them  on duty passengers have to wait.  
 Yesterday was the Italian National Fete day & Bands etc. occupied the Streets. We went to the KURSAAL & saw TROVADORE by Italians. They are a handsome race of people.
