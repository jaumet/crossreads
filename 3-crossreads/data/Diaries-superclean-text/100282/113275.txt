horses that have been killed, there are hundred of them along the corduroy roads I don't know how we would get on if it was not for our horses in spite of the motors trains etc, the latter can only bring things a certain distance it then falls on the horse to plough through the mud water shell holes etc, they have the shells to face for theirs is a dangerous road, but they never seem to flinch not even when they see each other getting blown out, they are much more courageous than a mule.
9th The 2nd Div our 3rd Bde hopped over this morning, about 11 oclock the prisoners started to trickle down, they reckon they got a fair number, the French English also went across on our left, they also gained all their objectives funny thing no one seems to have much trouble now in pushing Fritz out of his strongholds if it wasn't for his artillery the war would be over in a week.
Buried a few more chaps today, I don't care much about this game myself
