F & Hot
Meet Hassells & Les Luker also Len O'Brien. Meet Bill Allinors. I go to Bulford & meet the boys in Mess. It is a lovely hot sultry day & we cut out the fire. We all go to Boozer & celebrate, but I have a row & buzz off. I am very put out but eventually go to bed easy in my mind.
I see H. Hey & M. taking off. C.H.H. has Sheperds Plain & M.C.R.[?]20 April, Sunday
F but windy.
I go to Tidworth all morning with a victim of sand-bagging. E.T. is drunk horrible. Recd letter from Jennie. I go to T'worth Delhi after Tea with a Patient. It is a lovely ride in the cool of the evening.
