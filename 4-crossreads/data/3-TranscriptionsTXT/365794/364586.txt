Wednesday 4 [3] July 1917 [1918]Busy day as 6 pts. go out & we straighten up the ward gradually.  Fights go on always as regards food & it is very poor.  Bread & dripping L.A.S. sour puddings, "high" meat sometimes is making our boys desperate & I fear an attack on the "bull ring" as the D. Hall is called.
