 Thu. 28th Nov. (cont.) Had a splendid little three-course dinner &ndash; port, sherry, beer, but no liquers.  I entertained the Major with lies about my experience in Canada (where I have  not  been), but Huss the S.S. chap, gave us some regular thrills with his experiences in Germany, (mostly lies too, I s'pose.) 
 Fri. 29th. Breakfast with Jackson, order a car for 11.30 am, interview the Merchant Service representative here and get a 1st class railway pass &amp; a few quid, slip back to a cosy club which has plenty of big cretonne-covered chairs, coal fire, and a bar.   Huss, Ted, &amp; I get our car about noon, sail past our civilian ex-fellow prisoners who are now plodding down to the train and leave for London about 1 pm.   Then &ndash; London. 
 Miss Rodell met &amp; carried off the Boy &ndash; I found N.W.M. waiting, resplendent (naturally) in The New Naval Burberry, a badge like a rising sun, and an ebony-and-silver cane.
