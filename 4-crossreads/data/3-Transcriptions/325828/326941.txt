<p>My dear Anna,<br/>Excuse this short scribble but I am just sending it along with a couple of nose-rags that I thought you might like.<br/>I wonder if you got my last letter that I sent you from Serapeum.  I have been kept pretty busy since then but I haven't forgotten you, &amp; I often wonder how you are getting on.  I was very glad to hear from Father that you are getting on so well at School &amp; I hope you will get through your Exams in November alright.<br/>Thank you so much dear for your letters to me.  I have received them all, at least I have had 4 altogether &amp; I was so glad to get them.  You have no idea how welcome letters from Home or Australia, are out in these parts.<br/>Accept the enclosed, dear, with much love,<br/>Your loving brother,<br/>Leo.</p>
