I got a great lecture from our brigadier when he told me about it and felt like a hero. He was very pleased indeed & spoke of it as an exceptionally great record. From what I know of this caper it is too.
So far have managed to keep very fit. The tucker is good & just now we are receiving heaps of clothing for the winter. We could not have been looked after better & are doing better here than we did at Broadmeadows.
Of course the fighting goes on continuously. There is never any spell for any thing & in the end it wears most of the chaps down.
Just at present we are receiving news of big doings in France. If true they ought to bring peace very near. The old Turks can fight some but once his German stiffening goes I think he goes too.
There has been fearful slaughter here and really Jack I've seen heaps & heaps of dead. When one sees two thousand odd in 1/2 mile area it makes one's ideas go round a bit. We have lost a great number of our old boys as you will have seen by the papers.
Lately we have been getting a great number of reinforcements & it makes it seem like a strange regiment. Some of the other Regts have gone for a spell. We are expecting one in five or six weeks.
