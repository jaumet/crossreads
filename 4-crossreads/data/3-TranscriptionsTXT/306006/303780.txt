 18-3-17 brought Cobb back to the Anzac Hostel where she was to meet Sergt Marsh at 6.30 Harris &amp; I met Kingsford there had dinner &amp; the heard the Welsh choir giving a concert till 9 oclock &amp; then came back early. Several coming merry last night had a few words with the Police at Heliopolis who tried to arrest them but found they could not as they made a fight of it; Tonight the Police got square as the whole Troop was waiting for the 10 oclock &amp; 10.30 train they took all the passes from the lads as they got out &amp; then allowed them to come on to camp several of the lads had faked passes, it will end in a riot here before long
