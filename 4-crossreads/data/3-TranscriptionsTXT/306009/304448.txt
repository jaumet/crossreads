 1915 Sep. 23 Thu. Had my last swim at Montazah during the morning. After dinner heard that a body of a man in military uniform round which was a lifebelt had been washed ashore on the beach. Went along with one of the Scouts to have a look at him but it was too far away &ndash; Walked back through the fruit laden date palms. Left Montaza at 3.30 pm by Motor Amb. &amp; caught 4.10 train from Sidi Gaba arriving at Cairo at 7.30 p.m. Had dinner in town - &amp; then back to Gezira once more having spent the best 8 days since I arrived in Egypt.
