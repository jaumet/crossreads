  
 30/5/17 Bouzincourt & Henencourt The sports commenced and there were good events. One was a mademoiselles race and about 6 men were dressed as girls - splendid pretty girls too complete to scent and violet powder. It was impossible to distinguish them from the few genuine mademoiselles who were there. Some nurses came over during the afternoon. The boxing was good in parts. Acted as time keeper. Our man Caffrey knocked out his opponent with a hard hit right on the point. Acted as timekeeper for this. When all the boxing was finished we formed up and marched home getting into billet again about 10.15 p.m. Never have the men been in better heart for a long time. Singing, whistling & great esprit-de-corps. The Australian is very emotional and affected by surroundings. It was a splendid collection of men today all fit and well. At last they seem to be giving all of us a rest and there is talk of yet another couple of weeks of it.
