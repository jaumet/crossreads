<p>other than a fully trained nurse?  These are lots of English people resident there &amp; these, both men &amp; women were always busy helping &amp; cheering our men.  It was summer while I was in Egypt &amp; a great many of the English &amp; French women had gone to cooler climates, but even so there were plenty still there &amp; a good many Australians like myself whose family affairs took them there &amp; now that the cool weather has set in, <strike>there</strike> the residents will all be back &amp; once more visit &amp; look after our men;  &amp; so I do not think we need feel that we are wanted there.  But here there is much to do.  Red Cross work must be done &ndash; we must not slacken our efforts or our dear ones will feel the pinch on the other side.  Then there are the homes of our <strike>men</strike> soldier friends &ndash; perhaps they have left a Mother or a sister, a wife or children &amp; surely we can visit &amp; cheer these &amp; thus do our bit.</p>
