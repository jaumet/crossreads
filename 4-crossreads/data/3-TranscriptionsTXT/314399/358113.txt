Saturday 26 April 1919Raining this  morning. Bill & I wandered everywhere looking for flats or rooms. Went to see The Very Idea. Gee it's rough. Still we enjoyed it. Moved to Bill's hotel for a day or so. Its in Blomsbury Street.
Sunday 27 April 1919Nice & sunny for an hour & then rain. Snowed later on & lasted all day. Very heavy too. Went to Twickenden to see Mrs. Aveling but she was out. Then went to Marie's flat & stayed there until 7 pm when we left to meet some girls. Took them to the Stoll Movie house & then home. Missed the last train & had to walk from Kings Cross to this place (in Blomsbury St).
