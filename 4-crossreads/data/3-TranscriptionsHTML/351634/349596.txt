<p>(Sunday 25th continued)<br/>lots of big shells into the hills. We are getting to the close of the first day.<br/>They called for volunteers for boats to bring back the men who had landed. Went ashore with boats and and stopped for 2 hours but got good news that boys had dug in and were holding the position so we went back to ship it started to rain and we covered up all the wounded on deck. The ship is full up<br/>I gave all my blankets and water proffs to cover them up. We are going ashore to morrow. After amunition is out so will be working all night.<br/>(Monday 26th)<br/>We got into lighters at 7 (AM) and were towed in by a Torpedo boat got on the beach at 8.30. We were fired at by the Turks with shrapnel and bullets were flying all around us but we were lucky they never got one of us in the lighter we were in. We got a fine reception about an hour after we landed in the way of shrapnel The O.C. says they will be keeping us on beach for a few days.<br/>A coy of the 13th landed shortly after we did Well we got our dug outs fixed up and Mac and I are together. We have to go down and unload a barge now. The Turks started shelling as soon as we started so we had to knock off any way we managed to get her unloaded Warships are still bombarding heavily We will try our new home to night living just like rabbits.<br/>(Tuesday 27th)<br/>Still on beach uloaded several lighters. Boys anxious to get into firing line They shelled the beach very heavy to day They have taken a lot of prisoners since landing There is heaving fighting on the left where the New Zealanders are have not heard the result Well dug outs are not too bad to live in one thing we are well sheltered from Shrapnel. It is raining to night and very cold<br/>(Wednesday 28th)<br/>The Turks shelling the beach before day light this morning and knocked over a few cases of jam It is a bit quieter this morning Heard that the 4th Brigade took another hill They got orders to hold the position Turks rushed the trenches but were driven back Reinforcements arrived this afternoon [indecipherable]...ashore tonight Warships destroyed more of Turks guns</p>
