  
 Tuesday 11 February 1919 If you engage a Cook even at 2/-/- a week I will pay all extra expense at Bronte.  I do not wish to be an expense or to make work for Day. Am glad you sent May some clothes for Jack.  I expect I shall be too stout for many to fit.  What a lot I will have to tell you.  I hope to get a decent billet for a home for Dolly & my Babe.  7 weeks & I should be home dear old Mother & Day, I do look forward to it. Cold better, throat bad.  Filled in form for every man re Demobilisation, his previous work, pay, etc.
