My dear FergusonYour letter came 3 days ago - and I thank you for it. What could you say? What can I reply? - Archies death is disaster to us for which there is no remedy. The world will never be the same again - and if I have the misery to grow really old I shall go sadly to the end. I hope that length of days be left out to me. I have had sufficient - I heard Archie was wounded at Colombo - I never doubted but that he was dead - and I heard it was so at Suez - It was a horrid voyage - but there were v kind folk on board. I of course hurried on to England so I had no chance to look for yr boy - I pray all will go well with your brave children - and that the sorrow of "looking on ones children in the light of ancestors", Bruce E Burkes expression when his only son died, may not fall heavier upon you. I let my feelings go to you dear man for I am not unmindful of that tragic night in the Blue Mountains - It is etched in my mind now - and so you know all about my present blackness of despair - I got home and found May a wreck - her support being Stephanie Barton, who was with her when the news came, guite casually too, in an advising letter to Stephanie, not from official sources. Stephanie has turned out a very rock of defence in these distressful days -
