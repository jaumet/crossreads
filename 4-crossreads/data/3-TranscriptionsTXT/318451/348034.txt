Saturday 25th Nov.We billeted in Merris.  I stayed at the old French priests place.  The Town was at one time in the German hands & bears a few marks of the Bombardment.  The Church & Convent were hit by shells.  A levy of 5,000 francs was made on the Town & the priest Honore Beleyat was held as a hostage to be shot if it was not forthcoming.  It was raised.  Had hot bath this evening & turned in & slept soundly.
Sunday 26Orders came early this morning to pack up & move to the trenches.  Quite unexpected.  Motor Transport conveyed us to Armentiers.We were from 1 oclock till after dark before we found Billets & had to sleep without blankets on the floor.  It was very cold.  The Town has normally a populace of about 35,000 including Houplines suburb but there are less than 3,000 in it now.  Houses are wrecked.  Beautiful Buildings in ruins, Churches in a very bad way.  Almost every church is in ruins & many lovely private homes smashed up.  Half of our men went into the subsidiary trenches today.
