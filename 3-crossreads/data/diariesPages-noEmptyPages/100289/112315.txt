Saturday with my good night nurse to "Romance" played at the opera house.
Sunday went out to the nurses home for tea had a fine time, quite a treat to go to such a fine home spend a few hours. More trouble in hospital, two of the boys being sent to Bristol under escort. Tuesday went to Cheltenham to the Winter Gardens to see the picture, "The Birth of a Nation" but was very disappointed with it. All we Australians here marked for transfer to our own hospitals
