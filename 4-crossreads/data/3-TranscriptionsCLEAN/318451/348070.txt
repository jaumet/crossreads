I hope it will be a success, I think it will.  The guns have been fairly quiet but as I write, 10 p.m., there is a rumble of guns, heavy at times.  Capt. McLean called today & Capt. Davidson who has been away with sciatica for 7 or 8 weeks, looked in this afternoon.  I spent the evening working up an address on "Watch Ye" for tomorrow.
Sunday Feb. 18thToday I had 2 services, one at Houplines with C & D Coy who are billeted in an old Brewery.  It was a very good service, the other with A & B in an old Factory near town.  As the men had just come out of the Trenches, the numbers were not quite up to usual.
Monday 19thHave been at Houplines again today.  The weather is considerably milder & it rains occasionally & things are sloppy.  I had lunch with Capt. Blake & B Coy's Officers, drew pay today.
