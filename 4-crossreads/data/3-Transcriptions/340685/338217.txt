<p>30.7.16 Reveille at 6 breakfast at 7.15 and moved off at 9.15 the pioneers having gone at 2.30. They were badly knocked out as they carried their heavy packs and blankets and ground sheet as well. Arrived at Canaples at 1 P.M. and had a dinner. Just before entering there is as steep slope and we went on ahead to find the way and this is our rest home. it is certainly a beautiful spot and quiet. The village is fairly large and the railway runs through connecting to Albert. Had a  refreshing bath in the creek after a shave. Our camp is just outside the village near a fine old Chateau and now used for military headquarters. To enter the little forest glade we cross a swift running beautiful very clear stream and inside is wonderful fresh grass and fine shady trees and on two sides of the square is a stream running and one of which has beautifully very clear drinking water and which we are using higher up for a divisional baths which I helped put up. Along the stream it is covered in by shrubs and creepers and very beautiful and quiet. McNamara and I visited the village in the evening and went to a French wine shop after having a good look round and later met some French brother sappers who gave us a good time and after making purchases of chocolate and fruit we came home. There are a large number of troops here and they are buying beer galore and now the stuff is adulterated with water largely and not very good. There is a vegetable field just next us and onions have been borrowed and we are living very well indeed porridge and bacon for breakfast custard for dinner and fresh meat for tea and in addition we buy fruit (tinned) fish, lettuce, and other tasty dishes. Retired at dark and slept well.<br/>&egrave;31.7.16 Reveille at 6 and check parade at 6.30. Fall in again at 9 and told off for any fatigue and the rest of the day is absolutely ours. I have been going very hard all the time fixing up my gear washing and writing letters galore and now write to 24 and get letters from 18 and also been writing up my diary which was left undone since 20.7.16. Got paid at 12 to-day magazines and papers from Auntie Sarah. Bed at night fall.<br/>1.8.16 This morning we were reviewed by Major General Walker who congratulated us on the way we had done our work under heavy difficulties and advised us to get all rest possible <strike>when</strike> and the way we took Pozi&egrave;res  although the papers haven't mentioned Australians at all and give the Tommies credit for it but I think they want to keep our presence secret.</p>
