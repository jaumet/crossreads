<p>Was down with a fatigue party this morning to get our rations such as they are, the food here is very poor &amp; scarce<br/>Poor old Andy Anderson one of the originals was killed this morning, a piece of shell went right through his steel helmet &amp; killed him instantly.<br/>A lot of our Australian artillery is in action today, they are firing like mad &amp; have got the range to a nicety, the way they shell the wood in front of us is something terrific, all day long there are shells bursting in it from 3 in. to 12, I can tell you the latter send the earth &amp; stuff easily 300 ft high &amp; go off with an earsplitting roar, I have seen them uproot big trees, such is there power, our chaps have never stopped bombarding since we came into the trenches, I don't know whether you believe it or not but it</p>
