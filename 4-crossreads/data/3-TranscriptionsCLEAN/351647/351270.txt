 Dear old Mac, 
 This letter if it ever gets to the size of a letter will be a thing of shreds & patches, I'm reduced to scraps these days (paper rendered useless by my making silly bloomers, mostly & I hear you sarcastically murmur, "You won't need to buy any more").  However I don't suppose it matters much.  I find a chap really doesn't know what he is & what he can do.  If you had told me even 12 months ago that I'd do what I do where I am & live under the same circumstances, I wouldn't have believed you.  When I was in the D.A.C. [Divisional Ammunition Column]  only a  & they asked me if I was open for this job & because I was sick of the damned D.A.C. & wanted to get back to the Brigade here
