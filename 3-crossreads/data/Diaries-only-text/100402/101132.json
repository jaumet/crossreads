Saturday 7 September
Fine day with a swim in the Somme just W. of Peronne. This afternoon a walk to Mont St. Quentin over which the French had to fight in 1916-17 which our chaps had a victory a week ago. It is a dominating position over looking the ruins of Peronne about a kilo away the river. It is well fortified but literally strewn with German dead.
The Balloons moved forward to-day so our line must have advanced. We move to-morrow to Doignt, on river Cologne, S.E. of Peronne.
Sunday 8 September
Move this morning to Doignt about four miles. Our route lays through the outskirts of Peronne, which is badly knocked about. Peronne is a moated town of great historic importance, Quentin Durward etc. Wet to-day. Living in a cellar in a decent one time concrete houses. A walk round the village cemetry shows where the Germans have opened up tombs taken the metal from coffins. In one the body (half decomposed) is lying in full view bones are to be seen all over the place.
Transferred from bearers to clerical duties.
