Saturday 29 July 1916Up fairly early to pack things &c. A real summer's day, bright, hot & dusty. Our march to Bonneville led us thro' one particularly lovely avenue of poplars where the shade was lovely, & past the main aeroplane depot behind the present push. About midday we reached our destination, the men having fair billets, but the officers had to camp outside in a well-grassed paddock. My canvas sleeping-bag was much appreciated at night. During the afternoon had to fix up the pay for the company & H.Q. & was kept going for a while.
