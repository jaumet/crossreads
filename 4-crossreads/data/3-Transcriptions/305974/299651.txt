<p>28 Thursday<br/>I don't think I mentioned that the 4th field Amb has been cut up to fill the different posts about, most of the squads are in dressing stations as there isn't much stretcher bearing to be done up here.  Another one of the 12" guns was firing this evening with the 60 pounders.  All firing together they make some noise.</p>
<p>29 Friday<br/>had rather a large sick parade this morning.  Dug a bag full of potatoes up.  They are rather large &amp; good spuds.  There are a good few fellows digging them so I don't suppose they will last long.  There are very large mosquitoes here, they are absolutely the largest I have seen, but they don't seem to trouble you like the small ones.</p>
<p>30 Saturday<br/>Freddy Ryan's squad (bar me) went up to Spoilbank this morning, &amp; Len Burnett's squad came down here.  There was rather a big bombardment on over Ypres way about 9.30 pm.  All timepieces have to be put back an hour at midnight tonight on account of the daylight saving</p>
<p>1 October  Sunday<br/>This last couple of days Fritz has been putting shells very close to our quarters, otherwise everything has been very quiet.</p>
