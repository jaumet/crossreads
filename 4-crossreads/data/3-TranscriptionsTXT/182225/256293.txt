 JUNE&nbsp;&nbsp; FRIDAY 23&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916 
 Another muggy day. It was our washing day, so we had no parade in the morning and as washing was not dry by dinner time we had none in afternoon either. I practised semaphore signalling in the morning and read all afternoon. The &quot;Kent&quot; was away out on the port side all morning turning &amp; twisting about as if she was looking for something. We were pulled up for half an hour in the evening, but it may have been to let the &quot;Marathon&quot; catch up as she had fallen behind again.
