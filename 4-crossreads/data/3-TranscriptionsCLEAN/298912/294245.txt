S.S.Arabic (P&O)   mail steamer leaves for London during afternoon, the people on board cheering us as they pass. The Colonel stood on the poop too & to jig him, the men yelled out - "So they take your blankets & hammocks from you - Do you sleep on the floor-   etc. He had nothing to say as usual .
