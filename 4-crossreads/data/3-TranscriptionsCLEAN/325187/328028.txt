[Thursday 12 October 1916]
We go Riddlers & meet 4 P.M. Troc. to meet Mrs Bartlet Charlie's father & Mother in law-  I find they have a Drapers Shop at Eltham a London Suburb, only a small one, & also run a house agency business apparently well to do & really not bad sorts but not what Laura would have chosen-Went to dinner (Champagne) at Capt Riddlers old friends of the Isherwoods & very nice people-   I have married a dear little lady Mother, a bit extravagant perhaps but has common sense.
