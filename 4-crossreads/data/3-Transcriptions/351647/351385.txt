<p>life isn't a joy at all.</p>
<p>I saw Dr. Lethbridge the other day, he doesn't look too well &amp; I don't wonder as lately he's been having a particularly tough time.  The conditions of things are so rotten too.</p>
<p>Today it started with snow then rained &amp; now things are so sloppy again.  Last night everything was quite hard &amp; nice but all the same I nearly howled with the cold.</p>
<p>Last week early our Adjutant went to Paris for a little trip.  His place was taken for the time by a Mr. Lynnot, a very nice little thing but such a fuss pot &amp; a ditherer, bleats a bit too &amp; lots of times I could knock his silly 'ed orf.  But still he's rather a decent little sort &amp; means well.</p>
<p>Playfair is back but has not taken on his job yet.</p>
