<p>My dear Girls:/</p>
<p>8.45 a.m.  St Patrick 's Day has come and gone once again, quietly here into the limbo of obscurity, being counted amongst the three things that never return &ndash; time.  You know of course the other two as enumerated in the Khoran by Mahomet for the faithful to remember:  "There are three things that never return: the fleeting moment, the spoken word, and the lost opportunity".  In regard to the latter there is a very terse, very true, frequently applicable her, quotation on the Ruskin calendar of this morning:&ndash;<br/>"Much education sums itself in making men economise their words, and understand them."<br/>If you had only to listen to the continuous silly chatter, irresponsible egoism, want of understanding, of the little, rotund, vain, uneducated, mendacious, arrogant, commedian who sits opposite me a table, you could the more fully appreciate, the truth of Ruskin's sentence, which is taken from his Munera Pulveris.</p>
<p>It is noted in history that the conversion of the Irish by St. Patrick, was in the 5th Century, c 450 A.D.  During the same century the English began to settle in Britain, and the Kingdoms of Kent, Sussex, Wessex, and Northumbria were formed.</p>
<p>In the 6th Century, circa 597 A.D., Ethelbert, King of Kent, was converted by St. Augustine.</p>
<p>In this morning's paper I noted, that the Orama sails, outward from Suez, on the 25th inst.  I shall post what has been put together on this &amp; following pages on the 22nd or 23rd inst., with hope that they may be sent to Suez and thence onward.</p>
