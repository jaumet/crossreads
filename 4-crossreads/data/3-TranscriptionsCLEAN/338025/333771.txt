  
 Monday 20th August 1917 Dickebusch Harnessed up by 8am. Carting bricks from Dickebusch to road backing onto camp. Aircraft got one of Fritz planes at 9am. There were two flying over lines and one of them burst into flames. The aviator managed to plane down but when near the earth he took a dive must have struck the ground with great force. Taube over at 9.30pm very few bombs dropped.
