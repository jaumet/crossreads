Latter says 2 years since he heard a woman's voice!!  Evening duty Matron did rounds with me & told her friend I was the naughty girl who ran a high temp. for some days, etc.Wrote report 1st & sent note to Matron.  Off 8.10 p.m.  Now that I know them I like the sisters here & tone of the hosp. generally.  Raining at intervals & cool.
