 After dinner I read some poems to improve my French & amuse them by my imitation of Goyard - They seem to think it rather good. I copy some pieces out & will learn them. She lends me her Larousse & L'Archeologie Egyptienne, & as I have a cold coming on she doctors me up with aspirin & an infusion. 
 30-6-19 Wrote up diary & intended to go to bank but miss doing so. In afternoon I seek for [M. Chaqius secretariat de la Faculte de droit] but being unable to read Prof Truchi writing find myself in Rue Ponthien instead of Place Pontheon 
 Visit Duke at 5 & ride in staff car to his home. After which I return to mine by metro. 
 Metro here have no seats in some carriages & very few in the others. Each train of 5 carriages contains 1 1st class car & as I am not a Frenchman ie I give my seat to any lady & will not seat myself so long as a lady is standing I generally stand & as often as not stand 2nd class for my boots are as comfortable in 2nd class as in 1st
