  
 on rejoining & in a few months should get my Captaincy. I have given a great friend of mine a Capt J.J. Collingwood a letter of introduction to you -     he is being invalided back & is pretty badly knocked up - here is his record - came away originally as a private was on the Peninsular the whole time, getting a Military cross as a Sergeant & a commission, received his Captaincy in France & was severly wounded at Pozieres, he was recognised to be our best & gamest officer, a reputation to be envied in a Battalion like ours. Well my dear sister, fondest love to your dear self- Ralph & Beres. from Ken
