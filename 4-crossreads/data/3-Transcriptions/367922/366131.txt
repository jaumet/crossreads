<p>31.12.16<br/>23.2.17<br/>Saw Westminster Abbey the day before I left London. The finest &amp; most interesting historical spot in the world. The carved roof shown in this picture, is carved out of solid stone &amp; is the most wonderful &amp; finest roof of its kind. What a glorious time I have had here seeing all the historical spots in London! I've had a great time &amp; must tell you all about it later on.<br/>Reg.</p>
