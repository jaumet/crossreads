<p>Sunday Nov 25<br/>Our way to water lays about 3 miles down a red road with Wattle &amp; Gum Trees plentiful. I never expected to see this out of Australia. The Turks are shelling particularly the water so there is still plenty of excitement.<br/>Monday Nov 26<br/>Town is well occupied with Hebrews &amp; Bedouin &amp; swarms of Hebrews are returning with their Donkeys laden with all manner of goods. Some of the shops are reopening &amp; the Jew is out to do business in Souvenirs &amp; take you down if you stand  it. Jacko shelling. Auckland Reg suffered heavily taking this place</p>
