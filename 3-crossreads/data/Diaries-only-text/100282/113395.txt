The Zoological Gardens here are about the poorest I have seen for the size of the place, everything looks so dilapidated dreary, the reason why is that labour is so scarce things have to be let slide, they have only a handful of animals, among them being the Kangaroo Tasmanian black opossum rosella parrot white cockatoo a few more birds, take them all round they are a very poor collection, but the Paris of today is not a patch of pre war days. There has been great rejoicing over the fall of Jerusalem the whole population are as happy as larks, one can easily see that they are much more swayed by their emotions than the hard cold Britisher it takes quite a lot to stir our blood compared to the French, the place to see it is in a theatre you would be surprised. The roads streets here are a pleasure to walk or ride on they are splendid so wide, level as a billiard table a lot of wooden blocks have been used
