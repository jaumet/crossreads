<p>Tuesday the 26th inst. (26.5.1915) broke calm &amp; peaceful &amp; we who were resting kicked off our clothes &amp; turned in for some slumber.  About 12.30 p.m. our attention was directed seaward &amp; there a most pitiful sight rewarded us for our look.  Our own ship "H.M.S. Triumph" was in difficulties having been torpedoed by a German submarine.  All eyes were directed toward the rare sight &amp; our hearts were full of sorrow for the souls aboard.  For a few minutes she lay over on her starboard then completed a full tilt &amp; remained thus bottom upwards for quite a while.  Then with a swirl &amp; a rush all that we observed of a once mighty ship was a few bubbles where the final plunge had been taken.  Even as I write I cannot believe that I actually witnessed the sinking of a battleship;  it was so unreal &amp; not like one is expected to see &ndash; either pictured or described.  The actual sinking occupied only ten &amp; half minutes so I don't know how the men fared who were aboard.  Rumour said over a hundred lost their lives but as no offical roll call has been listed it is impossible to attest any number.  The scene in &amp; around the spot today is alive with small craft &amp;</p>
