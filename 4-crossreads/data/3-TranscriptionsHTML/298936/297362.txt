<p>July 1915</p>
<p>Friday 2</p>
<p>Worked in office during the day with thoughts ever of Rita.</p>
<p>Not much work but a lot of fooling.</p>
<p>Feel discontented, [a very wicked feeling] chiefly over not being promoted, but secondly over doubt whether I shall see active service.</p>
<p>Hospital work is however [indecipherable] .I must steel myself to disappointment &amp; put a brave face on work, whatever it is.  I am lucky to be able to serve my country even in a Hospital.</p>
<p>Cannot get over fact that Sgt Christie passed me over when I thought he had faith in me. A wound to my cursed pride.</p>
