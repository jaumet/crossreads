The snow still lies about fairly thick. At my billet two lambs have put in an appearance and the children are in high delight. Saw General Martin again this morning and then kept extremely busy right up until noon and most of the afternoon too. Went to the Green Diamonds for the evening. Their ?girl" is good. Picked next draft to go. The people here are very scrupulous about locking all doors at night.

Attended a conference at Group H.Q. where General Martin discoursed in platitudes and nothing very much eventuated except that I may get away by 7 May and that it is officially estimated that all Australians will have gone by 20 May. Afternoon interviewed different people and in the evening had a long walk around Charleroi.
