 Well, It's cold & wet here, and as far as I can see we are settling down for the winter. Don't think this war will end this coming summer, its only beginning. You need to be over here to realise it. Of course we will win, but not next summer, we have not enough men. The war will only be won by the number of men; that becomes more & more obvious every day. 
 I have settled down a bit now and the boys have been very good and sympathetic with me. Alan's death is such a glorious one, that as a soldier I cant help but feel immensely proud. I hope you will all look at it this way too, it will help you very much. The rough boys here are simply splendid concerning the fallen, and it is generally just a silent handshake. I know what it is to wait at home. But cheer up, For how can man die better than facing dreadful odds. For the ashes of his fathers and the Temples of his Gods." Give my very best love to all, & I do hope Grandmas is all night. Your loving son 
 Dene.
