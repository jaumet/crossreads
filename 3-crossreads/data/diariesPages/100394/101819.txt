Sent letter home enclosing 22 photos also wrote Adelaide and Mrs Pryor. Have been swimming mostly all day. There is great talk of us moving off but we can’t get any definite news. Went to a concert in Y.M.C.A. and heard my name being called as soon as I got into Camp. Three of us had to go into Ismailia as escort for a prisoner.

Got back from Ismailia with our prisoner at 1 a.m. Have a bad attack of influenza today. Saw Russ at Canal today when I was having a swim. Both he and Edric are Corporals now, but so far are only acting.

Have been fairly sick all day with the influenza. Bill Hilder was made a Bombardier today. I was expecting it myself as I am more competent than he in every respect but he knows more about the actual gun work as I haven’t had any at all. However I don’t begrudge him his stripe as he is a fine chap in every way. All leave has been stopped even into Ismailia.

We are having a very severe heat wave just now and it is about the hottest weather I have ever experienced.
