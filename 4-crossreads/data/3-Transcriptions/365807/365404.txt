<p>stationary warfare after reading of moves on   <u>every</u>  other army front except our own. Probably when our "show" does come we will have enough work &amp; excitement to last us for a considerable time, but at present, inexperienced, we are eagerly looking forward to it.</p>
<p>In the whole general news is satisfactory and the present position on the European front is greatly in our favour as far as it goes. Our forces have proved their superiority  in every branch of fighting, and in my opinion one of the most satisfactory facts is our undoubted supremacy over the Hun in the air. With the large losses of machines &amp; pilots the factories and training schools are going to be extended to their utmost but I think that we will remain "top dogs".</p>
<p>On the other hand Fritzy can congratulate himself hugely on the success of his submarine campaign. It is our biggest problem at present, and the solution seems still a long way off. Meantime any English papers you may chance to see will show how very serious the food question is becoming there.</p>
<p>The sinking of the transport "Ballarat" showed our fellows up at their best, don't you think?</p>
<p>My very kindest regards &amp; affection to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy &amp; yourself from Yours v. sincerely</p>
