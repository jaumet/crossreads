<p>5.<br/>We are having a very extraordinary winter here. At the beginning of the year an arctic blast seemed to pass over the Northern hemisphere, after tackling America settling down in Europe. The thermometer got down to below zero in the North of England and Scotland, but it did not last long, and during the last week we have been enjoying weather as mild as early Spring, and incredible as it may sound fires at times have become oppressive. However, the climate does not agree with me, or any of us for that matter. It is very treacherous, and when once a cold gets hold of one it is terribly hard to finally shake it off. I almost envy you people mopping your brows in banco in February whilst we will be shivering here.</p>
<p>I saw Street's nephew, Tom Street, at Salisbury Plains the other day. He had separated from Ernest, who I have since heard was landed at Suez suffering from appendicitis. It is very unfortunate, and I trust it will pan out all right. Poor Street's worries and anxieties are almost as big as your own.</p>
<p>With kindest regards from the family to you and yours.</p>
<p>I remain,<br/>Yours sincerely,</p>
