A feather bed and I did not rise until well into the morning of the 26th August. You will understand what a treat a sleep like this is when I say that in the line has no blankets, no roof to his "house" if is rains he gets wet through and he never sleeps at night. Nights are spent "stand too" , keeping his eyes wide open for Germans. In an out post, containing perhaps 15 or 20 men, one or two men are always on sentry during the day. Their duty is to look out over the top note all movement, shelling etc. If the enemy is not shelling too many heavy the rest of the men get what sleep they can at the bottom of the trench which generally contains mud or water. Shaving washing is out of the question and dug out in open warfare are only used by aid posts battalion and company headquarters.Our stay at Morcourt lasted lasted 11 days. We moved our billets from the village buildings and bivouaced in a field a few hundred yards away. In the mornings we did parades with rifles. These parades mostly consisted of practising attacks.A football field had been rigged up near by and the afternoons were spent in football swimming in a canal close handy. Our canteen was well supplied with cigarettes etc. so we did not fare too badly.We were soon feeling in pretty good condition once more.As the noise of the guns gradually became more indistinct we knew that the troops who relieved us had also advanced and were continuing to do so.5th Sept.On the night of the 5th September we were warned of our moving the next morning.
