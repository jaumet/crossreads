<p>Dear Dad,<br/>This is an Inn that Tommy and I had a drink at on our way from Eastleigh &amp;<br/>Romsey. It was supposed to be used by Mr. Pecksniff in Dickens Famous Book. The Beer we had had been placed to near the "strong" stuff &amp; seemed to be inoculated for it has a sickly taste. There is a fine carved mantlepiece in the Saloon off the bar &amp; one could picture old Pecksniff in this corner &amp; that corner &amp; ordering his drinks in the sanded &ndash;floored top room. It is only 3 miles out of Sarum &amp; is a lovely down Hill run from that place. It is a very hot afternoon &amp; I have let all the Boys off. One of my chaps has gone to fetch his wife &amp; kiddies to Durrington. I have some really good chaps &amp; some  d.... Mongrels. Well, I must write a letter as well &amp; I'll address that to Mum. Best Luck &amp; sincere Regards to Otto &amp; Mr Quinn &amp; Mr Cocks  Love Harry  X</p>
