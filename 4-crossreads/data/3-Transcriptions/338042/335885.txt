<p>June 1918<br/>June 1st.<br/>Our last show at 4th Army H.Q's (Flexicourt) &ndash; Oppressive weather &ndash; Completion of new &amp; original recitation &ndash; So far un-named.  The boys having a spare morning, go bathing &ndash; but feeling rather studious, I do a little reading &amp; writing<br/>June 2nd<br/>Sabbath &ndash; Pack up &amp; leave for our camp at Bertangles &ndash; Germans still slowly advancing &ndash; A pleasant surprise, in the form of "18" letters &ndash; twelve from Home &amp; Friends in Australia &ndash; others from Mrs. Scales &amp; English Friends &ndash; Very Happy!!!</p>
