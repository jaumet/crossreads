 Sun Aug 11th  At O.T.B. 
 Finished Letter 34 to M.S. 
 Shall be jolly glad to get over to France and on to our Job. This messing about in Camp would drive a man to drink. Went to Picture Show after Tea. Best 3d of pictures I ever had. Saw Enid Bennett in "[The] Little Brother". 
 Mon 12 Still bumming around the Camp. One good thing a man gets plenty of tucker, so things are not too bad. 
 Tues 13 Was issued with gear at Q.M.S. They wanted to put 13/9 down in my Pay Book for a Waterproof Cape they had not credited me with at Weymouth, but I wasn't having any. 
 They sent us out on a Job, but every man bucked against it, and we got off. Shall ne mighty glad to get settled down on our Job, as it's a bloomin' nuisance this messing around. 
 Wed Aug 14 Poor old B.E. will get a shock when she knows I'm going back to France. Shall be jolly glad to get some mail to know how things are going at Glebe Point. 
 We "fell in" about 7 and marched to Warminster station. At least the others did, but I got a lift in a motor lorry with all the birds out of "clink". They were a bright crowd. There were about 500 men in the draft, and there was a big crowd at the station to see us off. 
 Thur Aug 15 Boarded Train and left Warminster about 10.30 last night, arrived Shorncliffe about 4 am, marched from there to Rest Camp; which is a number of big boarding Houses which have been taken over by the Govt. We had a wash and Breakfast and went aboard the Boar about 10.30 am.
