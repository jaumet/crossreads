<p>Wednesday<br/>Two big parades the general health of the regiment is very low as can be expected after five months here on the same food.  Twenty five men of the old Regiment went away to-day to act as a bodyguard to Sir Ian Hamilton for a fortnight, they picked them out of men that had never been off the Peninsular sick or wounded, 25 of the 2nd Regt came around to take their place.  The Turks put some more big shells over Anzac and at No 2 Outpost but did very little damage.  The Bde received mail to-day but the L.H.Fs have not so far.</p>
<p>Thursday<br/>Rained during the day but as I live in the dressing station I have no fear of getting wet although those in the dug outs suffered.  There is good news from the Sea of Marmora this week, I think that the subs there are weakening Turkey more there than all the land forces.  Our Aust. Reg. Siege Gun Battery are here now with their monster guns, we expect them to do some serious damage.  There are two big motor lorries running up &amp; down the beach road now this saves a lot of mule transport.  During the night the Turks went mad &amp; commenced firing for about an hour they must have had an imaginary scare.</p>
