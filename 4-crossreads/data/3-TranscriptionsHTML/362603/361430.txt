<p>4.  Home reaching My Room at 9.15 pm after a delightful Holiday.  Colin Lawton the second eldest Boy was called into camp on the day I arrived at Gy. so I missed Him.  He is a Pte in the Lincolnshire Regt. of Infantry.  His wife will draw 19/6 per week only, so She will have to go out to work now.  They have one child a bonnie boy of 3 years.  The other Boy the eldest is never mentioned.  Must be a bit of a black sheep.  I think He is married too.<br/>I am glad that you are making the Home as Comfy as you can</p>
