 Dear Miss King 
 Just a few lines to let you see I have not forgotten you. I wrote to you from Colombo so I hope you received it all right: I have been over here now five months and am getting very fat and am having a good time only I wish this business was over. There is not much use wishing is there Miss King, so the only thing for it is to stick it until we are victorious, and I think they are all anxious to see it through. It has been very cold over here. I can assure you your mittens and balaclava kept me very warm and am keeping them in good order for next winter. I felt it cold most at Imbros but now that we are back in Egypt from the Dardanelles it is not so bad. There don't seem to be any prospects of the war being over this year Miss King but let us hope that it wont be much longer. I am sending you a photograph of myself and a little monkey that was given me at Tel-el-Kebir. I see where the Red Cross is doing great work in Australia and am sure the soldiers welcome their gifts I had a Red Cross shirt and a few other little things given me here and they were very acceptable.  As news is scarce will close with kind regards from Would like to hear from you soon Private R. Otto.
