<p>the old Hororata, my word we thought the trip over on the old boat pretty rough &amp; said we we never travel on her again if we could help it but by jove she would do me to be going back on.  All the the 25th rein. are over here now &amp; quite a few, about 5 or 6, have been wounded.  Mr. Binns the officer we came over with is proving himself a good man &amp; as game as any.</p>
