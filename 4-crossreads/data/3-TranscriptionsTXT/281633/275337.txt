 Tuesday Perishing for lack of lucre.  Visited Flixecourt in the morning. 
 Saturday 19/10 Putting Elect. Lighting in the Camp through the Week. 
 Monday, 21.10.18 Engine Driving last night.  Engine room (Lent) infected with Frogs was trying the effects of Electric Shocks on them (the Frogs).  They didn't like it, but it didn't seem to injure them permanently.  The Driving Belt was running just a few inches above the Grass.  The Frogs thought it was a plank I think so because they used to Hop on to it, I never noticed the same Frog do it twice.  As soon as they struck it they used to fly off, spinning so rapidly that they looked like Green Balls.  A couple were foolish enough to hop on to the exhaust pipe of the Petrol Motor.  That was the last thing they ever did (it was nearly red hot).  Several were blown Kite High by the Blast from the exhaust.  I went to Abbeville this morning.  Had a lovely Drive on a Lorry, through beautifull country, the morning was misty &amp; fresh.  I don't think I will ever forget the loveliness of the trees with their autumn colouring.  Spring merging into Autumn  that  is the prettiest sight I have seen. 
 Fri. 25/10 The Boys now have a Pierrot Troupe of their own.  No one is likely to mistake them for professionals for a little while anyway. 
 26/10 We played the 5th F Coy. A.E. yesterday at Soccer &amp; Aussie Football (&amp; got beaten at both), later we gave them tea &amp; our alleged Pierrots entertained them.
