Sunday 27 May
On Thursday night we had a little of alleged messages, & a little hypnotism.
Scotty Haine, who again held most of the conversation, is a gruff Scotsman with swarthy face & iron grey hair (although still young), & rather penetrating eyes.  By appearance he seems of rather a commanding personality until one gets to know him & then - one gets the impression that his personality is not large enough to fill the body made for it.  He seems a little worn out, & apart from that, not of a very brilliant intelligence
