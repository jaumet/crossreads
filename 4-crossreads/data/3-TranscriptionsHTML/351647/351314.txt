<p>this place isn't conducive to decent writing anyhow, it isn't a very large room &amp; when you get our own four officers, the D.T.M.O. (don't ask me what it means but he's an officer from another crowd) in it, the gramophone going hard &amp; the telephone buzzing at not infrequent intervals, well it's rather pandemoniac.  There's a noisy primus started now.  I am very tired &amp; rather crabby, I cycled to --- 8 miles in the teeth of a high wind &amp; then back &amp; have had to wade into things since my arrival back.  You've no idea of</p>
