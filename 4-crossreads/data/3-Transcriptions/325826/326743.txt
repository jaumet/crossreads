<p>4.  Leo &amp; I have a little private code affair by which he will be able to let me know in the first letter he gets through where he is, but I shall be in honour bound to keep it to myself over here, though I may be able to write it to you because it will be so stale by the time it reaches you that it can do no harm, and in any case the Censor could cross it out if he liked.  I know how anxious <strike>he</strike> you will be to know his whereabouts.<br/>Rid &amp; I have a different rather ingenuous little understanding too, but he is going to cable me as soon as he reaches France or wherever it is if there is the chance.  A lady here whose husband went a week before Rid had a cable from him a little less than a week after, from Marseilles, so that if I do not hear from Rid in about a week I shall conclude they have gone somewhere else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is all very dreadful this not knowing where they are isn't it?  We get very very little news here, not nearly as much as you do, &amp; at the moment I am writing you may have a much better idea of where Rid &amp; Le are than I have.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rid's unit is 2nd. Brigade 1st. Divisional Artillery you know, don't you.  The 2nd. Brigade of course includes 4th, 5th &amp; 6th Batteries &amp; one the twenty something.  Rid did not seem sure of himself, it is a new one just added, some new arrangement by which they have added an extra battery to each Brigade which formerly used to contain only three batteries in the artillery.<br/>This is Monday and it was last Wednesday evening only that they went so that there has not been time to hear yet.<br/>For the present now I shall just have to wait and see what happens, where they go &amp; how long they are likely to be there wherever it is, before attempting any new move myself.
