pelting us like anything. The ships are keeping the tip of the ridges under a continual line of fire - am just told that we have landed 20,000 men. We are transferring into the boats - it is raining lead - Turks firing wide.
It was a relief to get ashore; we were packed so tightly in the boats and moreover so heavily laden with out kit that, had a shot hit the boat, we should have had no chance of saving ourselves - it was awful the feeling of utter helplessness.Meanwhile the Turks pelted us hot and fast. In jumping ashore I fell over, my kit was so heavy; I couldn't get up without help - fortunately the water was shallow at this point, otherwise-.It was a magnificent spectacle to see those thousands of men rushing through the hail of Death as though it was some big game - these chaps don't seem to know what fear means - in Cairo l was ashamed of them, now I am proud to be one of them though I feel a pigmy beside them.Wish there wasn't quite such a damned noise with the guns, it is sending me all to pieces - don't think I shall ever make a soldier.
The beach is littered with wounded, some of them frightful spectacles; perchance myself I may at any moment be even as they are. Indians bringing ammunition mules along the beach - this scene of carnage worries them not at all.It is commencing to get dark - we are now climbing the heights.
