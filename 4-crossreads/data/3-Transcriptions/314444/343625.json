<p>My Darling Sweetheart</p>
<p>It is with the greatest of pleasure I take this opportunity of writing to you hoping to find you in the best of health as it leaves me at present. Dearest Violet, after I wrote my last letter to you saying I had received several letters &amp; cards dated Feb &amp; March I received three more letters a few days afterwards dated Jan &amp; early in Feb. The mail was delayed somewhere &amp; of course they arrived late but Dearest letters from you are always welcome no matter if they arrive a year late.<br/>The last letter I wrote to you was not very good I am afraid because I was in the line &amp; it was hard to find a good place to write  so Dearest I hope you will not mind when you receive a letter like that. We came out of the line on the 18th after being in for 15 days. The weather was nice all the time but you cannot always have a wash or a decent sleep owing to being so close to "Fritz". When we come out for a rest we generally have a camp 3 or 4 miles back from the line &amp; a weeks spell does us a world of good.<br/>Today the general came around and complimented all the boys on the good work that was done. Some of the boys won military medals &amp; of course the general made a nice speech &amp; the Band played &amp; everything passed off O.K.<br/>I am always thinking of you Darling &amp; wishing I could see you again even for 5 minutes &amp; that would be better than seeing all the Kings &amp; Generals in the World.</p>
