Rumours concerning an early end of the war, the coming in  of Roumania etc are floating about but I turn a deaf ear to everything not official altho. always something of an unbeliever this game has made me much worse.
Wednesday 30th AugustNews confirmed about Roumania declaring war & there is much joy thereat.  'Tis a sure proof that neutrals think we are winning and will surely influence things.  Heavy rain all day & as I had no duties spent the time writing.
Thursday 31st August.Chief duty of the day was to dig trenches to carry away the water.  By means of 3 sticks I graded them off so that the men could dig them with the desired fall & not up & down as they generally do.  Great lot of drinking going on in the corps & in fact everywhere men being "full" for days on end until their money runs out.  The Estaminet would have been closed long before only they represent a big thing in the income & support of the local people.
