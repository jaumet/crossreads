the cheeky little field guns kept plugging away, I was expecting every minute to see the gun its crew go flying sky high, but no, I'm hanged if he could hit it the battery was still firing when he knocked off. Had a shave this evening, first one for 10 day's I wanted it bad enough as you may guess, but everything has been against a man lately we have been so miserable wet, however I borrowed an article here there scraped my face clean again for a man might just as well be killed clean as dirty.
Sent a fatigue over to Flers village where our Hqrs are, to draw 48 hours iron rations this in preparation for the charge. Had a fairly liberal issue of rations this evening, bread, jam, butter cheese, bully, milk, bacon, raisins, pork beans, tobacco matches, one of the best for some time
