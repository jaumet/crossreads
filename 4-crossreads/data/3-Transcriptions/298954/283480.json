<p>1917<br/>Fri. 15th June<br/>Our little home the Scoffers have christened the "Hotel du Wolfchen"  for obvious reasons (the "Wolfchen" is the name of the seaplane!)  The inaugural dinner at the Hotel du Wolfchen tonight was not uninteresting.</p>
<p>Our Chief Steward (a smart Cockney know as "Slim") &amp; Jimmy the Mess-Room boy were appointed as our stewards by the Mines Officer.</p>
<p>"Slim" showed his present independence by "cheeking" everybody &amp; James calmly sat down in our greatest Pride and Joy, a wicker arm-chair sacred to the Captain which he managed to have sent over here.</p>
<p>During the Banquet (being Friday, our evening meal is supplemented by a little Horse Sausage) he suddenly spotted James in The Chair!</p>
<p>He rose, caught him by the ear, and hurled him from the "Hotel".</p>
