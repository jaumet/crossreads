<p>18 June 1915<br/>Friday (Centenian?) of Waterloo<br/>(annotated 50)</p>
<p>Wrote home &amp; Nell<br/>Our engineers opened up new trenches last night but owing to decomposed nature of bodies laying about they had to abandon them, enemy used many star shells last night &amp; this morning we had another visit from Jack Johnson he landed 4 within 30 feet of HQ one in our sap but beyond blowing up a lot of soil he did no damage, warships have been bombarding Helles &amp; here all day long we hear that we are to move forward in a day or two. A bomb throwing competition was carried out today at Quinns &amp; the Turks were quite annoyed at the reception they got. Visited the snipers today &amp; made preparations for further visit tomorrow &amp; as plenty of work is promised us we wont growl. An issue of rum to hand on account of the centenian of Waterloo the boys wish there was one every week. Enemy have bought 18 pds to bear on us Oh hell!<br/>19 June 1915<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Plenty of bomb throwing all night &amp; artillery as norm as day broke, shrapnel 18 pds mostly one of our planes put in an appearance about 8.30 &amp; was heavily shelled for miles but escaped unhurt. Our field guns were placed in position at Coutneys tonight &amp; are expected to open fire any minute now. All day since 4.30 am [indecipherable] have been bombarding Achi heavily this I believe is the supreme effort &amp; we hear that the Tommies are in pretty well the last trench. The Turks have been withdrawing for days every available man from us &amp; sending them to Achi the Monitor caught a column on the march two shells finish Turks. At 6 another of our planes put in an appearance this time they gave her both shell &amp; m gun fire but she in her turn dropped two beauty bombs right on their trenches another 6" gun landed today we dont know where it is to be placed yet. We fully expected a mail today but it hasnt come to hand as yet. Finished up for the week at 12.</p>
