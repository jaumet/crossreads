on parade and I was the senior N.C.O. present, our work this morning consisted of draining principally.
After dinner I marched the Coy down to the baths for we all wanted one badly they had no towels clean clothes or nothing at all in the baths with the exception of hot water, but we had a bath and dried ourselves with our shirts and all came away feeling much better.
The day turned out to be nice and sunny and so brought swarms of aeroplanes and balloons out and there were a great many air fights, we saw 4 Taubes come down in flames and 3 out of control and diving head first to the ground.
We had our 2 and Blanket issued to night and by Jove we want it badly for it is very cold of a night time and wet clothes are not the warmest things
