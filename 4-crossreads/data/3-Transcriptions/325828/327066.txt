<p>However, Father dear, you know best, &amp; I leave it as you wish.  And that reminds me, a fortnight or so ago I cabled for &pound;12 as I was in need of cash, &amp; I received it without any trouble a week later.  Thank you, Father dear for arranging this for me.  I don't quite know how my account stands, whether you control it still or whether it has been transferred   However if you still control it, will you please withdraw &pound;3;5;0 &amp; pay same into Rid's account (or Ol's will do, for I don't suppose they are divorced yet)  When I was in London on the Staff, Rid visited me for 3 or 4 days.  Whilst there he lent me &pound;2, &amp; he made arrangements with me to sell his camp bed for &pound;1-5-0.  I did this &amp; paid in later on the &pound;1-5-0 to my account in Bank of NSW for Rid.  Meanwhile I wrote to Rid telling him I was holding the money for him until I heard from him.  Since I have been up here I have had that letter returned, <strike>&amp;</strike> even tho' I put Rids correct address on (2nd Bgde Hdqtrs Artillery, 1st Aust Division, A.F.A, France)</p>
