bad feet so paraded next morning and were evactuated. I was thinking of cleanliness so went down to Fricourt baths with the company but had to go on a lorry. I paraded next morning but my luck was out for the doctor said your feet are very bad but we are going up to the line this afternoon so every available man is wanted you'll have to do the best you can
