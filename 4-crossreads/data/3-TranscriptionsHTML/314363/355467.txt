<p>5.3.18 Prince Ruperts.<br/>The raid on Sunday night came off all right. Owing to the dark, things got mixed up, the farm intended to be raided, was not, one prisoner was taken &amp; a small machine gun, our side has one missing &ndash; two slightly wounded.<br/>Last night was a queer one. At night we put up a two minute bombardment, it was sharp &amp; furious, then later a raiding party or something went over &amp; there was another heavy bombardment, this time it lasted for about an hour. Fritz did not reply very much but after everything had settled down again, he suddenly opened up a furious bombardment against the 3rd Div. lasting about a &frac14; hour, to which we hardly replied.<br/>Wytchaete 15.3.18<br/>A couple of nights ago there was a raid on our right at the same time we had a dummy one. This was managed by dummies made out of wood painted up &amp; from the front looked very real. They are so arranged that by pulling a wire they would rise from the ground, &amp; move their arms. These were put out in No Man's Land 200 yds or so. Things went well at first drawing a lot of machine gun fire, it was intended to drop them</p>
