<p>3/9/16<br/>Slept in being very tired and then had a loafing morning not going outside the door until after lunch. Walked then rather out of the town going inland along a pretty little glen heavy with green ferns and carpeted with a thick sole of grass. The trickle of water is heard everywhere. Above the town towers a big crag of rock covered with trees and other green but with many an outcrop, on top is a big circular stone structure like a Coliseum and then another place apparently ruined. Gaelic is spoken in all the homes here and English at school and elsewhere. The sunset behind Mull was gorgeous and the reflections in the still waters of the bay kept changing colour as the hour grew darker.</p>
<p>4/9/16<br/>Took train for Glasgow at 12.20 and came via Stirling passing through fine scenery en route. Passed in the distance Rob Roys grave, the ford where Bruce lost his broach and the house of Rob Roy (or was it Bruce?) burnt down by the soldiers of Montrose. Every glen seems to have its own local legend and an old Scotchman travelling with me explained. Reached Glasgow at 5 pm. Ad Balfour is staying at the Central too &ndash; a weird looking [indecipherable] with a [indecipherable] black soft felt hat &amp; a walrus look.</p>
