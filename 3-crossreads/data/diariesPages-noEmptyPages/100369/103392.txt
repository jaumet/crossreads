Girt with modest robes of sacrifice
Let us not mourn this Gory bed 
A challenge flings to all who see to raise
A song not born of sorrow, but of praise.
3
Of noble clay, and so we do not mourn
But, in our pride of him
(Who giving all, obeyed the voice,
That, whispering down the dim,
Vast arches of the Centuries, speaks to man
And him lay down his life for another)
Believe that far beyond Times finite span
We shall again behold our brother,
A soul uprisen from the Cumbering sod
Renewed, Eternal, face to face with God.

The Monoplane
1
Swiftly and cheerily
Swimming and swinging
Taut wires merrily
Humming a lay
Way in the upper air
Circling, unconquered there
Bright in the morning glare
Winging her way
2
Surely and steadily
Diving and wheeling
Gracefully, readily
Bearing the strain
Down in a giddy reel
Answering hard on wheel
Then on an even keel
Balanced again
