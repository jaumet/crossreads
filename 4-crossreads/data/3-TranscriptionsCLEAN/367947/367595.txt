  
 If we get it, it will mean a good holiday in Egypt which will be very acceptable indeed especially now as all my living goes down as first-class. 
 Lizzie writes bravely & seems very well & gives great accounts of young Will. 
 Give my love to Al Ede Clare Ted Hen & all the kiddies also the Godkins when you write. Tell Bob Anderson about my luck. Well old boss must close now, am giving this to an officer going over to Egypt so it ought to reach you OK. 
 Good bye old chap for the present with fondest love from your loving brother. 
 Will.
