<p>Book.  VI.<br/>Thursday. May 17, 1917.<br/>Continued from Book 5.<br/>This is the opening of the sixth diary since I have left Victoria, and two of them written in England &amp; on the water I have already posted to my wife.<br/>[Shorthand]<br/>The war is dragging very slowly to an end. There has been a lull in the Western front during the past few weeks, but lately we have renewed our attacks &amp; gained small ground, especially on the R. Scarpe, and at Ypres. There is a big muniation strike in England, which is not very encouraging. Firmer measures should be taken with strikers in war time.<br/>I wrote a long letter to my wife to be posted in England. No 78 [Shorthand]<br/>Mr. Narick got word to leave here for Steenwerch to night enroute to England tomorrow. I helped him to pack up his things. He gave me a new shirt and underpants &ndash; that he could not take with him. [Shorthand]<br/>To night is very quiet. The rain has left off, but the ground is very muddy.</p>
