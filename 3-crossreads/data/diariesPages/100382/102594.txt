The 25th being the Anniversary of the landing on the Gallipoli Peninsula all the Azancs Anzacs were given a speech also an issue of rations to celebrate same. Atl At 8 o'clock of the morning of the 26th I had to fall in with a fatigue party for the trenches when we reached them was detailed off with the Engineers we worked all day and arrived back at our billet at 4 mp. After having tea we had to fall in again was taken to the light tramway depot had to push trucks of Engineers gear to the firing line under fire. We arrived back at our billets tired wornout about midnight thus doing fourteen hours fatigue that day. The next morning we were awoke at reveille had breakfast then fell in went for a hot bath altogether had about 5 miles to march all marching in these parts is done is small groups in single file on account of the enemy's artillery fire. At 11 pm the alarm was sounded we had to turn out stand to in our billet for about half an hour then it was found that the Germans were bombarding on the left of our line so we got the order to stand down everyman had to sleep in our clothes but we were not disturbed again that night but it was found that the Aliens had also used gas.
