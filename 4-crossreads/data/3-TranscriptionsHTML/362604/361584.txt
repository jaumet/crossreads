<p>I had some lovely Dances &amp; I played a waltz as an extra.  Nobody wanted my blood afterwards so I guess the time was alright &amp; it is 3 years nearly since I played for a Dance.  I am to play the whole programme through at a Fancy Dress Ball next Wednesday from 7.30 p.m. to 1 a.m.  I have had a little practise &amp; I guess I'll be able to manage well enough.  I met Billy Allison.  He was looking fine &amp; is still at the same occupation as a Sanitary Inspector.  I had a Photo from Hilda Hickson in Salonica.  It is very fine &amp; nice to have.  I have also opened up a correspondence with George Millar, having found His address in an old diary that I have.  Well, Mum, I am going to try a few lines to Dad also so I'll just ask you to remember me to all kind enquiring Friends.  Tell them that I cannot possibly get time to write to them all.</p>
<p>Fondest Love to Dad, George &amp; Yourself<br/>From your own Boy<br/>Harry.</p>
