<p>18/10/17 Paris<br />one who last time was foolishly lavish with tips, the femme de chambre and all her minions were lavish with greetings. Turned straight into bed and slept until midday. Had a dejeuner of caf&eacute; au lait and rolls before going out. Took the Metro. to the Opera and from there executed some purchases in the way of clothes. Paris is just losing her green dress and winter is commencing to walk abroad. The ladies are wearing dresses of dark material and seem just as charming as ever. Much glad eye about. The street crowd is a gay one. Many French officers in their red gold braided kepis with the Croix de Guerre and other decorations on their tunics. Now and then an &quot;as&quot; passes in his airmans dark uniform. Children carrying the day&#39;s supply of bread. Long rolls about a metre</p>
