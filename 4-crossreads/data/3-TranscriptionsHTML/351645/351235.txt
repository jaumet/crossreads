<p>3.<br/>but the Turkish &pound;1 note was only worth 2/- and as it was bulky to carry round, the men did not bother very much about it. However reverting to the Afulen where we had lunch we found the railway station a rather modern red tiled type of building. We crossed the line here and after walking a mile <strike>xx</strike> almost due North East came to the hills surrounding Nazareth the H.O. of Liman von Sanders, the German General in charge. The hills were high and steep and the road was an engineering feat, it zigzagged doubling and redoubling on itself. In some places being cut out of the sided of steep hills leaving steep gorges to the right and walls to the left. On<strike>e</strike> a portion of this road we saw the remnant of a convey of 80 German motor lorries which a day or so previously had left Nazareth laden with provisions for their front line troops which they believed were 30M. South. However the Imperial mounted troops and Indian lancers met them and they nearly all surrendered without trouble. About 6 of the drivers managed to either fire their lorries or run it over the edge of the road where it somersaulted about 50 or 60 yards, resting eventually in the gully. A splendid view of the Plains of Esdraelion was to be seen from the road through the hills. We who were walking arrived at Nazareth about five, the transport being a few hours later, delayed owing to steepness of the hills and the heavy pull for the horses. However on arrival of unit we found we had to take over the French hospital which the day before had been occupied by the 4th L.H.F.A. We worked that night carrying stretchers over very steep rocky paths and I camped with Bill Watt the motor driver in one of the ambulance cars. Also had breakfast with Billy, eggs and bacon being on menu. Close beside us was the remnant of a repair and erecting garage of the Germans. All parts of bikes and cars were found and in some cases were in cases new and unpacked. The canvas covering or tent was rather knocked about. That afternoon we took over the hospital which meant a week of very hard work and long hours.. It was the stopping place for the wounded and sick coming <strike>back</strike> from near the S. of Gallilee and North of it. We were very scarce of provisions at Nazareth and were drawing rations for 1000 men and patients. However it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, we gave every patient as much as they wanted which we managed to do by commandeering any food stuffs in the town. We got eggs by the thousand and champagne by the case, and after 14 or 16 hours of hard graft. A bottle of champagne or fizz considerably assisted to remove the tired feeling and tended to produce good feeling. We also managed to get a few green vegetables. After a day or so Hedley and a few others went with Capt. Campbell and took the German H.Q. as a hospital. It had previously been used as such and some German officers and nurses were still there. Rather a well equipped dispensary</p>
