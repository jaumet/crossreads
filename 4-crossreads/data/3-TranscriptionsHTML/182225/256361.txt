<p>AUGUST&nbsp;&nbsp; WEDNESDAY 30&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>It was a bit better day than yesterday, but it was a cold miserable day all the same. We were out signalling all day again. I got promoted from the 3<sup>rd</sup> class to the 2<sup>nd</sup> class of signallers. Warren &amp; the rest of the N.C.Os came back from the Larkhill school. Bill Nesbitt &amp; self went up to Lark Hill picture show at night. It is a better class than the other two but not up to much. I got a &quot;Mail&quot; from Linda.</p>
