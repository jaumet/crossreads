<p>My dearest Mother   &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>I'm still here but expect to leave shortly. Sister Pilkington left Southwell Gardens last Wednesday for Australia via Panama Canal.</p>
<p>Isn't she lucky? She will call on you   &amp;  hope you like her, I'm very fond of her, I'm very fond of her, she is very jolly. If it is convenient   &amp;  you like her. I should be pleased if you invited her to stay a couple of days. Her mother is in the country   &amp;  living with a married brother, so poor little Pilkie wont have a home to go to like me.</p>
<p>I'm longing to see you all   &amp;  feel tired waiting to sail.</p>
<p>Have not had any Aussie mail since Alice's of Nov 1st 1917. Expect some this week.</p>
