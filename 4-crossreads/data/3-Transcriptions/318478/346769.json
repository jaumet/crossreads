<p>Moascar<br/>July 1st 1919</p>
<p>Dear Colonel Fulton</p>
<p>I have hopped in here &amp; propose working at studies of men &amp; horses for 2 to 3 weeks after which if you are still in Cairo I trust I shall have the enjoyment of winding up my own little war with a few Egyptian sketches and your society.</p>
<p>I hear dreadful rumours as to the handling of my Plastescine child but have complete trust in you and do not anticipate much more than an ear or two or a head or two having to be replaced on my return.</p>
<p>Will you Sir please give orders for the case of materials left in War Records cellar to be put in right order that is a cover nailed well down &amp; the case sent or conveyed to Moascar as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Thanking you for your kind offices,</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours truly<br/>G.W. Lambert</p>
