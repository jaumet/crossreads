<p>In the afternoon I met the girl again at Hill St station &amp; we went out per bus to Sutton Park about 12 miles out of the city, its rather a nice place &amp; right away from the crowds, we took some fruit &amp; etc &amp; had a good time on the hills which overlook the country for a long way round, came back in time to have our tea in the city &amp; then both of us departed for home I arrived at the Hall just as a concert was starting so I ducked out of it quick &amp; lively &amp; had a cigar in the garden with the flowers &amp; my thoughts for company far better than listening to squalling tenor's &amp; soprano's</p>
<p>9th. Sunday &amp; rather chilly a cold breeze is blowing &amp; it looks like rain again hope it</p>
