  
 Well, the day was not over by a long chalk - The Matrunga & the Eastern came in & were vociferously cheered by the men - We had guests to dinner & as per usual a lot of drinking - The month had started & everyone made a new start - Talking made us drink & the drink made us talk - I dont think for years I've laughed so immoderately as I did last evening - A discussion on religion arose - The navigator got talking & told us that Mary Magdalene was conceived by the Holy Ghost - He got quite amazed at the laughter & sent for his Bible -  to prove it  - That display marked out the discussion in toto - It's a fair specimen of naval knowledge outside a man's own job - About 11 pm we got to bed & one man got a light to see that all the girls were in bed & went from room to room with his light - some times he fell down - Right - darling - you're in bed & so on & on - One chap had a photo on his wall - I fancy it was his wife & he wanted it admired & pointed it out - The man with the lamp looked at it & said loudly 'Well that's the blanky limit in women' - I laughed till I nearly dropped - You must never ask a chap to admire anything or anyone or you'll get an awful shock like our chap did -
