<p>when I get through with this job I want to live a very quiet life have seen quite enough excitement to do me a life time. Without having a pack of girls telling me off. Harry Crosses wife says she is going to get me married before I leave England. Says she has the girl picked out. I haven't seen her yet. Don't think there is much danger of my marrying an English girl though I believe there are a number of our fellows returning with their wives. The Australia girls wont like that. I don't think Harry Cross will be returning. His wifes sisters Husband has been killed in France lately &amp;amp: has left a very good busness.Mrs Cross wrote the other day &amp;amp: said she thought Harry would take the busness over.  It will be a very good chance for him. It is in the furniture trade I believe. Harry is still in England there isent any word yet as to when he is to go back to France. I think he will be safe until after the winter now. I am getting four days good conduct leave on Friday next shall go to London. Then if Harry can get the weekend off shall take a run to Birmingham.Well Father there is absolutely nothing to write about so must close. With love best wishes to all<br/>From  your sincere son  Clyde</p>
