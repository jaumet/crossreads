<p>29th.  Got our marching orders last night &amp; this morning we were up at 2 oclock for we had to catch the early train from Etaps, a big draft went away with us &amp; the Camp band played us down to the railway station, it is one of the worst bands as ever I heard, left Etaps in big trucks about 5 o'clock &amp; we soon reached Bologne where big batches of Tommies &amp; a few Australians got out to go over</p>
