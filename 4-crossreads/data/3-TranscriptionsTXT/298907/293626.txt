very restless & fed up, & try as I would I could not get to sleep, just before we left Dover they gave us some bread & butter & tea, how funny this war bread seemed after the white bread which we get in France for you know the army in France get the very best of everything, civilians of course are rationed & I must say I like the French war bread better than the English, it was dusk when we pushed off & the train rattled along at a merry pace & we arrived in Birmingham at about 2 oclock in the morning, here we were met by more motors & driven to the Hospital, I was sent to The Queens Hospital on the outskirts of the city, in peace times it is a Public Hospital & the nurses & Drs are still here, it is much better
