<p>to join up the main stream have all had willows shoved into their banks  and these pollards are the source of large bundles of wands used for basket &ndash;making whilst the smaller growths that we should probably pile up and burn are done up in bundles to be burnt as firewood.<br/>Then a stone railway bridge spans one of the larger tributaries on which is built a fair-sized town. From small brick cottages women and children make their appearance and waving to the boys in return for their greetings call for souvenirs. Close by the wooden village bridge over the stream is a platform at which 2 women are washing clothes; a copper is on a fire behind them, but the main work seems to be done in the running water. About the centre of the township rises the church spire and the town clock is seen close by. Unfortunately the church building is hidden from sight by the houses. A further indication of the thrifty character of the country folk is given by the raised backing of the buffers in which thee local railway siding terminates being neatly planted with irises.<br/>At Chalon the line strikes away from the Saone passing through Chagny and Beaune, continues in a general  N direction to the large city of Dijon, which we reach in drizzling rain about noon. This is one of the very old French cities built on the site of one of Julius Caesars' camps and with its 75,000 inhabitants is a busy centre. The station comprised numerous platforms all roofed over with a high translucent dome. There are numbers of passengers waiting at the station, and amongst them are some French soldiers wearing the steel blue uniform and neat steel casque or tin hat, so different in appearance to the ugly basin-like British tin hat. Others belonging to the Alpine Chasseurs wear the kind of drooping tam-o-shanter, and yet  others the waterproof cowl or hood covering head, neck and shoulders.<br/> All seemed in perfect health and in high spirits in spite of what they had been through, for most wore 3 chevrons indicating 2 years service. These sombre uniforms  were in strong contrast to the gay colours worn by some senior officers seen at different times, consisting of red breeches with a gold stripe, blue tunics with braided cuffs and red peaked caps adorned with gold braid.<br/>Several French red cross ladies were seen moving about the platforms apparently doing similar work to our V.A.D.s. A further demonstration of the way the women were doing their share was given at one of the platforms where a train was drawn up. Instead of porters sweeping out the carriages moving packages etc young women were doing all the work. At a refreshment staff we were able to purchase some beautifully light finger rolls of French bread and Prescott persuaded one of the young ladies to go to a shop close to the station and purchase for us a small Tricolor.
