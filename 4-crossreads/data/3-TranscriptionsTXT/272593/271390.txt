in our huts.Sat up late tonight playing Bridge & after that we made some tea & showed one another tricks & etc with string & so on21st  Jock Mackie went away as billeting N.C.O. this morning.The company had a bit of stiff luck again today   hanged if No 9 platoon did not have an accident with bombs again   one chap had his hand blown off & hit all over, the steel helmets saved the other chaps life for a certainty for the pieces of steel went right through the steel & entered the skull if it had not been for the helmet he would have been killed as dead as a door nail, lucky there were not more casualties
