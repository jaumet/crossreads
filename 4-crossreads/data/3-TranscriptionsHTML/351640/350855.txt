<p>outside it gives one the impression that within must be comfort combined with luxury.  This Baron out of his private purse constructed the Basilica, as also the convent of the Sacred Heart, a very large private expenditure, because each is a magnificent building.  He was in Brussels when the city was taken by the Germans, and was held as a hostage for some time as you may remember.  I do not know if he is in residence near to me at the present moment.  You will note a marked difference between "Avant six ans" &amp; "Apres six ans".   Is't so?</p>
<p>The Egyptians owe something to Australia for the eucalyptus tree, it is the best growing tree here which is not one of indigenous to the soil, no of these, unless it be purely an ornamental shrub can compare with the specimen from the sunny south, it grows in groves all over the inhabitted and irrigated land;  it cannot flourish where there is no water, but nothing of any size has done that adown the ages;  if a census of trees around Cairo were taken about Cairo, I fancy that the gum tree would be next in frequency to the date palm.   The fig trees and the mimosae which are native to the soil are very poor representative of the tree kind, being curly and knotty in both stem and branches.   The white and blue gums, for the length of time that they have had for growing in the country are very good specimens.</p>
<p>30.5-15 &ndash; 10-15 p.m.   This evening about 6 o'clock I was at a convent in Zeitoun for an hour.   The community is a French one, but a nun hailed from Dublin who talked English, with such an interpreter we conversed all right with the Mother Prioress, though I frequently felt inclined to kick myself for not being able to do more than build up a crooked sentence or two.   Some people are dullards in the art of spoken words.  The convent is not large as buildings are classed around Cairo, but every sister had happiness written on her face.   The New Zealanders have been camped alongside for six months, and they never cease talking about the kindness which the sisters have showered upon them, their doors were always open and every man in uniform was free to come and go as he liked.  The Romans had frequent opportunity to hear Mass or be at benediction.  The Prioress is a fat, good looking, not old lady.</p>
