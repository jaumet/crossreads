to have had a good time, and has the knack of describing his adventures in a rather humorous way. I only hope I can manage to rake in a trip to England before I return to Australia again.
As for the war news, we hear nix, practically, though the Russians seem to be having it all their own way as far as the Turks are concerned. I wish they would let some of the thousands & thousands of us, who are here doing nothing, have a cut at someone. I don't mind who it is - as long as we get away from this inactivity. Who knows! perhaps we shall get it sooner that we expect now. There must be something very big going to happen shortly, with all the men that they have here and in England, just standing by. However time will tell. Hoping your are all OK. - Cheero!
