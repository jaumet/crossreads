Then we three went into Cairo &amp; did a little shopping, had tea in there &amp; returned to Heliopolis Hotel where we met 3 officers &amp; had ices &amp; cool drinks, returned to hospital about 10.30 p.m. Today worked all day &amp; now trying to write this letter with about a million interruptions.</p>
