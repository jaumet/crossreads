<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Thursday 7</p>
<p>Artillery Road dressing station. No cases.</p>
<p>Rather surprising that for at 8.30 p.m. a sham stunt started.</p>
<p>First came a few stray rifle shots, then the rattle of bags of cans being shot over the edge of <strike>the</strike> our trenches, whence they rolled towards the Turks trenches.  This occasioned a terrific fire from them &amp; at once a star shell made its appearance.</p>
<p>In the midst of this hurricane of rifle fire came a rapid carronade from a monitor &amp; destroyer directed at some important target.</p>
<p>Stunt lasted an hour.</p>
