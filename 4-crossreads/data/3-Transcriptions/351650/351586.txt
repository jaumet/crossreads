<p>This is a sort of prophesy, but the thing to try to be is to be just the same only better if possible.</p>
<p>Excuse the moralising please Mrs. John, but living outside in solid mud in this winter makes you feel a bit depressed, or perhaps I've got the blues.</p>
<p>So you can think what one would feel like if one was an infantry man, they are the heroes of the war and I for one take off my hat to them, (and pray for the good old days of civilian life).</p>
<p>A pretty dreary letter today, goodbye &amp; happy Xmas etc.</p>
<p>Love to old John &ndash; I really must write to him once more soon, but he can easily read my letters to you.</p>
<p>Good night &amp; cheer up,</p>
<p>John Chute Ellis.</p>
