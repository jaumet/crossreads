I think I told you I received the photo of Peg & Helen & thought they look splendid.  I want one of Bruce, Jean & Colin now to have the family.  Oh! & Violet.  I have a few souvenirs here that I will send you if I get any leave soon, a German bayonet, bottle & cap but unless I get leave soon the chances are I will have to dump them as one cant carry any extras on the move, it is more than enough carrying the bare necessity.
