<p>last Thursday but spent most of my time washing &amp; feeding &amp; did not have time to go out to Zietoun where I believe they are.</p>
<p>I saw Mrs. Lethbridge &amp; had a yarn, she looks so well.  Dr. is going OK I hear.</p>
<p>They don't allow any but officers in Shepherds or the Oriental now, the snobs.</p>
<p>My love to Graham &amp; the Boss &amp; Mac &amp; all at Culzean &amp; specially yourself.</p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>Jim Wilkie</p>
