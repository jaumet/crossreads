Tuesday 6 March 1917.
In camp. Our unit went out into the hills all the day and built improvised kitchens (field); shelters; and other requirements for camp sanitation.
Everybody disgusted still at the alteration of embarkation.
Came in at 5.30 pm and our O.C. announced that all orders regarding embarkation were cancelled.
(Boys nearly mad at this news.)
