 Wednesday 12 July 1916 Up fairly early &amp; got all the gear packed up &amp; ready for the transport &amp; after breakfast had the usual rush round to get the billets cleaned up. The battalion moved off at 9 o'clock the day being a fine one for the march, a cool breeze &amp; an overcast sky being appreciated. The route lay along the bottom of the valley in which Domart is situated, a fine clear streamlet flowing along the bottom &amp; in one place providing the power for a flour mill on the outskirts of a little village further on. Beyond this the road led over the railway line, through a small forest of very tall trees (poplars, beeches &amp; elms) at which point Leo buzzed past on the front seat of a  motor car, &amp; then commenced to wind round the opposite hillside, climbing to the top through fields of crimson clover in full bloom, wheat &amp; oats with the delightful intermingling of field flowers as poppies, cornflowers, mustard &amp;c. Crops much poorer. Charming view looking back along the valley to where Domart nestled amongst the trees. After a final stiff pull of an hour &amp; 40 min. without a spell, arrived at Vignacourt about midday &amp; then had to chase round after billets. A big straggling town. Billetted in a billiard-room. Took things easy during the afternoon.
