<p>How awfully sad it is about poor Laing, his parents will be heart-broken about it. What a dreadful time they have had!! I wrote to them while I was in England, sorry I took such a long time to answer theirs.<br/>Hope the basket arrives safely. I've quite forgotten what I sent in Annie Bell's box, it is such a long time since and she is in England, we are separated.  Her mother will let you know when it arrives. I know I sent a number of Photos &amp; P. cards of Egypt. Think also a parcel with brass-ware, anyhow you will know in time.<br/>Glad to hear both the new babies are progressing well. I bought a little dress for Bessie's baby &amp; shall send it for Xmas. Must get Flo's infant something. Shall not be sending home any</p>
