  
 19 February, 1916 Maadi I had to do day stables to day or rather for half the day, it is not a bad job but I dont know that a chap with a stripe should be shoved on it, by rights. We had to shift into the next row of tents which C squadron occupied. There are more rumours afloat about our leaving shortly but I expect they are up to putty.
