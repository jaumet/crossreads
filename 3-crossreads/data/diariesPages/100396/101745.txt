of invading Egypt, if this is a fact they show their good sense. from what I saw of the canal it would not be a nice place for a hostile army to bump up against.
The New Zealanders hold the suez end of the canal on this side Indian troops stretch from them to port said on both sides. I don't think we will be wanted there it is thought the the first 4 Batt will eventually go to France. I hope so as we will follow them I am thinking we will be here for a good while yet. But one can't tell.
We were told it all dependend on ourselves whether we went to the front or not at present we are only a depot rank We were also told that the first mob have a very bad name in Cairo they seem to have gone mad when they got here about 200 hundred are being sent back and others will follow. these chaps are a wild lot when they start. Some of the terriors found a new Zealander not far from here out in the desert with his throat cut he was not dead but I believe he pegged out later very probably he was to blame these natives wont be fooled about with. This happened on the 5th I have had one trip to cairo don't think much of it, walked about every where we could the native quarter is a horrible place the streets are like dimly lighted tunnels only a few feet wide I should like to have all day in the city but that is impossible under the circumstances we are allowed of leave each which means leave about every week for us we are supposed to get away at 2 oclock but the head men are don't trouble themselves about getting the passes ready till all hours of the evening. I went over to Heliopolis yesterday evening the town is quite close. it is a very flash place has some very fine buildings. One place built for a hotel
