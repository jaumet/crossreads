Poor old McDougall was evacuated with piles just before I left. Stan Wright is working in the Orderly Room & is quite well again. This Rest Camp is quite a big concern, carry well over a thousand patients. I quiet expected to be sent back to the Line again, but Major Bond informed me that he had a Job for me here, for which I am not sorry. We are arranging another Concert & tonight we held the first meeting. The last Concert was not too successful as most of the crowd had bad colds (especially Bobby Roberts) & they took strong doses of Mist. Tussi, which made them feel a bit "off colour". Hock Douch arrived back from Blighty just in time to take part in the Concert.

Fri. FEB. 9. Lill’s Mother’s Birthday.
This morning Serg. Fry put me in charge of the Blanket Store, which is a sweet Job. I’m hoping to get time to write a few Letters now. Last Thursday I got a lovely parcel from Lill, containing just the blooming things I most wanted. Good for you L.A. It’s a treat to get a bit of decent tobacco again. I made a Table & fixed up the Store, making it as snug as possible as I have to sleep there & also take my meals. Jimmy Whip is going to sleep here also to keep me company. After Tea we had a rehearsal & things went off fairly well. Commenced a Letter to M.S. The weather is fine & clear, but very cold. The nights are almost as light as day & a Fritz plane comes over every night & drops a few bombs. They call him "Midnight Charlie".
