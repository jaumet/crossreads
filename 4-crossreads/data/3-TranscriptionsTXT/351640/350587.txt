 1-3-15. Another anniversary today is that of the Prussians entering Paris in 1871.  They expected to be in Paris in 1914, they nearly were, but the hope of realisation was short lived.  A wonderful feat of arms it was to prevent them, one which will ever redound to the credit of British arms and valour, no matter how long the world may last.
