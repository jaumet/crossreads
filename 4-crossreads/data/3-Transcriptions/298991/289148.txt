<p>Wednesday March 7th<br/>A very strong &amp; exceptionally cold wind blowing all day; it would nearly cut you in to as soon as you would go outside. We had a bit of trouble with the tent during the early hours of this morning. It was nearly blown away on us. Went down into Boulonge  again this afternoon, &amp; upon inquiring for my pay book was informed that it had been forwarded onto here a couple of days previous. Shifted into the hut during this evening we have beds to sleep on there.</p>
<p>Thursday March 8th<br/>Snowed fairly heavy last night, but as the sun came out in the morning it soon thawed. We have twenty three patients in today, the most we have had for about a week now. Ours is a surgical ward. Received my pay book from the orderly room this morning. All our beds were taken from us, three boards &amp; two tressels were given to us to sleep on now.</p>
<p>Friday March 9th<br/>Snowing again today, but it isn't so cold as previous. They seem a very decent mob we have in the hut. Took very bad <strike>about</strike> in the afternoon &amp; had to come back &amp; go to bed at 7 pm. Very bilious with a bad headache, brought on by indigestion.</p>
<p>Saturday March 10th<br/>Very cold wind blowing. The weather has been very changeable this last couple of days. We had five patients in today, &amp; evacuated eleven to England so that left us with fourteen. They are all up bar two who are wounded in the legs. Most of them give a hand cleaning up around &amp; in the ward. Still feeling off colour, but much better than last night. Dr. ordered some medicine for me.</p>
