He was mighty pleased to see me as he half expected that I would not return, as Jan &amp; Feb men had been recalled from France to return to England for Australia &amp; I was one of that number.  However he showed me what was wanted by D.A.D.O.S.  They had called for indents to cover all deficiencies of equipment &amp; to state whether they were wanted or not &amp; as we had innumerable deficiencies, covering every branch of the Ambulance, it was some job to list them &amp; a particular one, as after this, all deficiencies would have to be paid for.  However I had lunch first then a wash &amp; shave &amp; although I had a bad headache, I had to start &amp; work through mobilisation tables, wagon lists etc.  Turned in about 10 oclock, having started the ball rolling.</p>
