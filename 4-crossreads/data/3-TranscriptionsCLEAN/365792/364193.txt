Apl 19  burst a few hundred yards to our left just near a gun possie. Oh it was great fun coming through the Comm' trenches in the dark - falling off now & then into a foot or so of mud & water, & slipping & sliding all over the place  Every few seconds a flare would go up & occasionally we'd have to duck as the parapets aren't very high & bullets don't mind where they go. The guns & trench mortars were dead quiet but even so we strafed the Kaiser no end. Harry & I went on post straight away & did a freeze the whole blessed night. Talk about mud & rain, it would break your heart at any other time. 2 hrs on & 1 off is the roster just now at night, & sleep in the daytime - perhaps.
20 The Dinkums are on our left & have had a few casualties already although this part of the line is dead quiet. Have to cook your own grub in this joint. Harry made the tea this[in margin] Armentieres  Lines (Fleur Bay)
