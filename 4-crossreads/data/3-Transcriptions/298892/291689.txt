<p>This morning the Corporal and I went round the wells for the first time for some days. We used to go round each morning and  always found them ice bound and and as all our efforts to thaw the pumps out were unavailing we abandoned our rounds. We received word yesterday that they had thawed so had to recommence our testing &amp;c. Things are very quiet on the lines and we had nothing to scare us. Fritz's snipers were busy and a few bullets whistled over our heads but not very close.</p>
<p>Thursday. One of our hobbies is collecting souvenirs and as we are all anxious to secure them there is a considerable amount of rivalry between us. Every morning we make a search round the brick walls at the back of our dugout for shell nose-caps and machine-gun bullets.</p>
