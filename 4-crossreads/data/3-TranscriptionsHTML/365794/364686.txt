<p>Wednesday 10 October 1917<br/>Rose 6 a.m., bath, tea &amp; motor trip to Mt. Lavinia 7.15 to 8.30 a.m., best of all our doings.  Long tree shaded street with every description of cottages &amp; fine buildings on either side.  Many people hastening to the temple to lay an offering of a bright flower on the altar (?) before Buddah.  Mt. Lavinia large hotel facing ocean.  5000 Boer prisoners kept in enclosure nearby after Boer War.  Inspected lace making &amp; bought hdkfs. 1/8.  Then went into Temple &amp; listened to life of Buddaha <u>before</u> &amp; <u>during</u>, most interesting.  10 a.m. took rickshaw to town, shopped, then photos on way back.  Visited Christ Church &ndash; as usual &ndash; took group of native children just out of school, then lunch 1 p.m., paid 9/3 photos &amp; films, boat again 3 p.m. &amp; our glorious 24 hrs. over but never to be forgotten.  4 Jap war boats in harbour &amp; one of ours which I snapped as she glided by.  We are once more at sea again &amp; Colombo like a gem of the ocean fades away astern.</p>
