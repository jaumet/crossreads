<p>One of our chaps went over to Flers early this morning &amp; got a great bundle of dry wood, with this he made a great fire opposite my dugout, we then got a can of petrol water &amp; put it on the fire, &amp; soon she was boiling merrily &amp; didn't we enjoy the tea, you have no idea how we miss our tea it means a lot to us I can tell you.<br/>Last night nearly the whole of the Batt. were out digging a new communication trench to bring our wounded down on stretchers ("White Flare Alley") so called on account of the white chalky soil it passes through, it will be completed tonight &amp; will be a mile in length 3 ft wide &amp; 5 ft deep that's good going you know.<br/>I have been very busy all the afternoon issuing sand bags, bombs, 303, flares, getting the picks &amp; shovels together, &amp; tins of reserve water, for tonight we are going to attack a very strong German position &amp; everyone has to carry something or other.</p>
