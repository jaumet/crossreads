<p>Dearest Eddy,</p>
<p>This is a picture of the front view of the hospital but not a very good one. I shall explain it when I return. The cross is where I sleep. The tram is son its way to Cairo. Your letters are lovely   &amp;  hope I shall receive some more this week. Give Grandma,  Mummie   &amp;  Aunts a big hug   &amp;  kiss for me   &amp;  take heaps for your dear little self.  From Auntie Ede.</p>
