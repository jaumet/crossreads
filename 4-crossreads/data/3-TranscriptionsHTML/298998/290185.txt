<p>today numbering three i.e. bread issue, doctors visit and dinner. The incident caused we unfortunates much amusement, although the average uninterested person will fail to see the humour. The monotony is cruel. <strike>and</strike>  The incessant craving for food is almost insufferable. During the afternoon several British aeroplanes raided the town; they dropped many bombs near the Railway station. Huns were running in all directions, shouting and yelling as tho panic stricken. Anti air craft guns opened up and the machines returned. This is a very daring exploit, and we all felt cheered. Raids in broad daylight are not customary, however, those men bombed the railway station with impunity. A Frenchman who watched the raid, told me that our machines returned safely. I am unable to ascertain the damage, but the bombs were of an extremely heavy pattern. I felt the subsidiary effects in hospital.</p>
<p>26TH 10. A.M. (Second dressing since 12th inst.)   I was taken into the dressing room; my X-ray photo's were produced, and examined by the Doctor. During the time I waited for attention, the Interpreter informed me that the tibial head was badly splintered. (His words "the bone in your leg is split".)   Immediately afterwards the Doctor commenced an operation. They extracted shattered bone from a Russian's hand, he was only three feet from my side. <strike>and</strike> The anaesthetic coupled with the unpleasant scene caused me to get the "wind up" as I expected something similar on my leg. When the operation was finished the Huns directed their attention to me. I was under this treatment for 30 minutes. The chief doctor extracted between twenty and thirty small fragments of bone, including several pieces an inch in length. The operation was performed without anaesthetic or cocaine. I suffered extreme pain, and bled profusely; how I retained consciousness is quite marvellous. My nerves were in a frightful state after the operation. The only consolation one has, is the knowledge of others who have suffered infinitely worse. <strike>therefore</strike>  It is however, one less ordeal on the future list. Anaesthetic is only used for exceptional cases. Hours after returning to my bed, my nerves twitched and irritated me, however, I <strike>received</strike> regained my equanimity.</p>
