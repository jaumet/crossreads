<p>31-7-16<br/>infantry had 5 men killed &amp; 14 wounded in consequence;  The only casualty from rifle fire today was a 2nd L. Horseman slightly wounded.  We received orders this evening to be ready to move off at 7 oclock &amp; as we only had 3 or 4 miles to go we should have arrived in camp early, but the main body lost sight of the advance guard &amp; got lost, &amp; it was 12.30 after midnight before we got into camp.  there a good stew was waiting us &amp; we were soon asleep;<br/>This morning a Turk was captured &amp; brought in, when the guard got him to the water trough to water his horse a couple of Indians came down &amp; wanted to cut the Turks throat, they scared the Turk but of course the guard would not consider the proposal</p>
