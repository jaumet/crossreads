<p>1918<br/>March<br/>thought that in about three weeks time the village would be levelled to the ground by the advancing Hun. Attached is a sample message as placed in the container on the pigeon's leg. While walking back to the camp I heard some machine guns firing in the air and saw that a captive Hun balloon had got away and floated over our lines. Our machines were diving at it and firing and eventually they set fire to it. it came down near Dranoutre and pieces were immediately cut off it by Aussies nearby for souvenirs. I got a small piece from a chap on the following day. Harold Brackpool dropped in to see me one day. He had been across to see Albert. He surprised me by dragging out a pipe and lighting up. I was still in the cigarette stage. We had a good talk about old times. He was billeted over near Kemmel. My feet were too bad to go back with him very far. On 15th March we moved up into the line again going into reserves near Battalion HQ</p>
