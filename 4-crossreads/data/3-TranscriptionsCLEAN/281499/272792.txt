We had 2 men pretty severely wounded & that was all our casualties, & the other Coy's were about the same, they had far more volunteers than they needed for this daring piece of work, for daring it was & they followed the terrified "Sausages" down their trench bombing them all the while & driving them like a flock of sheep.Received my pay book back from England this morning it was being audited  Some letters arrived for me last night  Some of them make reference to my photo's they reckon I look pretty crook & show traces of the hardships I have undergone hanged if I know they seemed alright to me when I sent them, however they have caused Len & I a good bit of amusement  The 3rd Battalion are taking over from us & we are shifting into reserves
