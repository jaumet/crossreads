<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>Many happy returns of to day! That mail I was expecting has not arrived yet but I had &nbsp;to start this letter today as it is your birthday and I&#39;ll keep it a day or two to see if that mail really does come. I have just had a tooth stopped by the dentist, and I really think we must be winning this war, because he actually made appointments with me when I was to come back - it made me feel quite civilian-like again. The dentist we had before used to tell about fifty men a day to come to him at 9 o&#39;clock in the morning with the result that back on the Rafa beach on would often put in two days sitting in front of the dentists tent before he even had his teeth looked at but of course we always had plenty of time back there, and it was an easy way of earning your five bob a day.</p>
