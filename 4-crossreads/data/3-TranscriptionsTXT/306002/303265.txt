27.8.15Fri. 27th.  Just as we got nicely settled in bed last night the rifles & machine guns opened fire & after the quiet time we have had I began to wonder whether the Turks were charging or not but it only lasted from 15 to 20 minutes so we lay back & slept the sleep of the just, & found this morning that it was only a demonstration, one of the lads on Popes was wounded with shrapnel as the result.  At 3 o'clock this afternoon all the guns & warboats opened fire on the Turks trenches on the left flank at 4 oclock, the charging commenced & the fighting has been very heavy all the afternoon, some regular English troops are taking part & we hope for good work from them, they are the Connaught Rangers from India.
