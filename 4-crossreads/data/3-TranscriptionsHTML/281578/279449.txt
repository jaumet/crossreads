<p>fat sergeant, &amp; said "Plenty bully beef", &amp; she always calls him "Bully beef." Whenever I ask any French girls their name, they always just give the first one, no surname. In the afternoon Merrett &amp; I walked down to the next village, St Leger. Merrett is brigade orderly sergeant &amp; I am brigade orderly corporal, it is a sweet job, nothing to do, &amp; better than falling in for drill. Most of the blokes are stoney broke &amp; yelling out for pay, but I saw a crowd by the roadside playing two up with what they had left. Actually saw a shop in St Leger, the first one, except for cafes &amp; estaminets, I've seen in these villages. The woman at the billet we are in now is a spinster aged 48, &amp; has Angele as a domestique for company. She milks a cow, which occupies a stall near ours (they have no paddocks for animals like we have, but stable them) has some fowls (there are fowls at every house) some rabbits &amp; a pig, and sells milk &amp; eggs. We boil the water for our tea at her fireplace; of course we eat our issued rations. I was sitting in the kitchen at night talking to the kiddie &amp; madame, when 4 girls bounced in for some milk, about 21 each. Got quite a shock, hadn't</p>
