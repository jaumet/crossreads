where we wanted to go & what took us there. From Horseferry Rd we went to the Strand where we got in the Tube Railway at Charring Cross to go to Wimbledon. By the way I forgot to mention Len Lyons ("nugget') was with me all the time as we had decided to stick together right through the piece.
It was not till about 4 pm that we got to Wimbledon Camp & I went to the Sergeants mess & inquired for my Brother Sergt Jim Taylor. They told me he was not in with his men so I stood outside the Hut talking to Nugget & wondering what he would say when he saw me.
Although I had never seen him in my life before I knew him as soon as he came round the corner, & I simply went up to him & said "Hullo Jim Hows things." Poor old Jim he was that pleased to see me, I never thought he would never let go
