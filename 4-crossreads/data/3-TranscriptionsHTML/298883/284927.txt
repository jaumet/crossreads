<p>last night.  The French people are highly elated over the turn of things.  They all declare that terms for an Armistice have already been signed But they are always very optimistic under these conditions and will believe anything.</p>
<p>We had our final lecture followed by the exam. this morning and have the afternoon off.</p>
<p>8th<br/>Spent the afternoon in Amiens with some pals.  There is no amusement there as yet.  I left the town by the 5.30 p.m. passenger train for Abbeville and we arrived about 7.30 p.m. rather a decent trip as trains are at present.</p>
