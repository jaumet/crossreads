<p>I am weaker constitutionally then when I arrived.  <strike>unless</strike> I could not stand nearly as much now as I could before the Peninsula days.  I hope I pull round in England.<br/>Left the wharf last night amid the shouts &amp; cheers of a few yachting parties in the harbour.<br/>Anchored near the breakwater for the night just as the Havanford did when I was leaving for the Peninsula.  Swimming party went on last night but it was too dark for my short sight.<br/>It is still very hot &amp; I am looking forward to a colder climate.</p>
