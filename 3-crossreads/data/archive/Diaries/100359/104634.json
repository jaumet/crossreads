Rations were very scanty and to improve matters the \"Big game\" is giving us a lot of trouble. We made a stew with Bully Beef & Biscuits, which with cocoa made a very good dinner. The fire took a lot of coaseing to make it burn, as the wood was very wet. We knocked a number of Amm. Cases to pieces for firewood. A No. of Infantry called in on their way from the front line and gratly enjoyed the cocoa we had. The 14th relieved us about 4 p.m. which gave us time to get back to <u>Green Dump</u> in daylight.
