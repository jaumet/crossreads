<p>Word was sent to night that three train loads of wounded would arrive in Cario tonight, that five hundred of the wounded will be sent straight on to No. 1 general, and that the others are to go elsewhere.   Just think of it after nearly eight weeks of strenuous fighting on the peninsula, our men are on the small piece of ground that they took during the first twenty four hours, and that notwithstanding strenuous efforts they have been unable to get further.  Wounded continue to pour in here, and this is the perifery of the hospital zone.    The congestion is deep enough here.  What must it be in the hospitals that are closer to the scene of action?   How many have been wounded altogether, The number must be now very large.</p>
<p>Very few prisoners have been brought along.  It is very desirable that as many as possible should be landed in Egypt for exhibition, and the only conceivable reason for there not being presented for view is that they are not on hand.</p>
<p>The demeanour of the soldiery and general population is becoming changed, I refer to the native soldiery, sure indication that they are provided with knowledge that is not in our minds, and information that speaks not favourably to our cause.  It is of little use being anxious yet one cannot help noticing the signs of the times.  The motor car drivers tell me that the natives in the streets are becoming cheeky.  No[ne] has better chance than the drivers to make observations as they are so much about and at all hours of the day and night.   A French man was talking to me last night, and he said:  "What a wonderful number of motor ambulances you Australians have sent from your country?"   The work that they do is of the utmost assistance in helping along the military work around this city, without them it were not possible to cope with the work.</p>
<p>One hero has just come to my hospital.   He happens to be an Englishman from Ireland.  Others will come later, I shall wait till 1 a.m., after that hour I shall leave anything that turns up to the clerks.</p>
<p>11-6-15.   Five men came in after I went to bed, making the inmates 241 this morning.   The conundrum of the moment is.   Will any Australian who has been at the Dardanells come back without the mark of bullet upon him?   He will certainly be a rare bird should he do so.</p>
<p>After being fed well the things in most demand by the soldier as he exists in hospital is tobacco of some sort, his preference is for cigarettes, he will accept them as a gift or purchase them for himself, the australians being the most highly paid men willingly buy, the Englishmen being the lowest paid, get them from me as a gift, and not having orders upon which the men from New Zealand can draw I also give them some.  The men returning from the Darda</p>
