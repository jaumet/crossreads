<p>the movement was a failure.  About midnight we blew two mines under the "German Officers Trench" &amp; the 6th Battln made an attempt to charge it but were met with terrific fire &amp; partly through some bungling here again the movement was not a success, a good many being lost for nothing.  The least that can be said of the 6th Battln who were mostly Re Inforcements is that they were certainly not a success.  At the "Salt Lake" on our left a huge Force of Tommies were land &amp; they are making a good advance on the Turks "Right Flank". On our "Left" the N. Zealanders did well advanced a good deal &amp; this morning took 900 prisoners.  Things are going well all along the line &amp; again today there has been a very heavy bombardment both from the land Batteries &amp; the Navy.  During last night the Engineers assisted the Infantry in every way possible &amp; had 3 casualties.  Some large shells 11.2" lodged along the trench where sap. Higgins &amp; I were working today &amp; did a good deal of damage burning a good many.  The Turks are putting up a very stubborn resistance.</p>
<p>8th<br/>During last night the Tommies made good progress &amp; the Left flank &amp; today continued doing well.  In the early morning there was a terrific bombardment from the boats &amp; Howitzers covering the Tommies advance &amp; on other part of the Field N. Zealanders &amp; others are doing well on the left while things are very favorable everywhere.  About 9 p.m. news came through that the Tommies had taken hill 971 a very important position.  Today Sap. Turnbet was practically blown to pieces by a shell while Sap. Gorham &amp; Stallard suffered heavy shock &amp; injuries Sec. Cpl. Bird</p>
