 Monday 3 December 1917 Lovely days now &amp; Miss Moreton &amp; I fly to town &amp; shop 2-5 then home &amp; duty again. Robson (N.Z.) leg ampn. &frac12; way to knee, condition not good for operation &amp; veins for some distance above amp. full of clotted blood.  Why oh why do not more doctors come out &amp; these pts. get more attention.  Many cases of secondary haem. occur of late &amp; deaths are numerous. No war news save more fighting up in Palestine.  A notice is up calling for volunteers for Palestine, sisters are applying quickly.  We are debarred not having been here 6 months. I find Miss Womald asked Matron to let me stay in Connaught &amp; Matron spoke very highly of me to her etc., so now I must put up with all the "nagging".
