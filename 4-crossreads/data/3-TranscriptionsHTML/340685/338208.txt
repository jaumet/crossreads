<p>a hill and is at a constant temperature of 49 degrees F. parade at 1.30 which lasted about 3 and took the form of a gas helmet inspection and we were each given a new type of respirator with rubber sponges round the eyes. After the parade we went up the hill over the caves through beautiful green shrubbery and when on the top got fine view of the surrounding hills and the spires of the churches. We then came down noticing another entrance to the caves on the way down and saw the rest of the village. It is comparatively small and one can't buy much. The church was interesting and the graveyard very fine with numerous vaults. I brought away a candle. It has a fine organ in a gallery and a chime. Came back to bed and the rest of the evening was spent in a Philosophical discussion with Tonkin who was formerly at Saints.<br/>14.7.16 Rain this morning. Rifle inspection also and then were dismissed. After dinner. Lecture on our future work in advancing in this country and I have since then been writing this up and performing sundry jobs. Letters to-day from Ludlow and Mum. <strike>Parade at 1&amp; we had a lecture on tactics in an advance in</strike>. We were dismissed and then fell in shortly afterwards for pay and I got 20 francs. The price has gone up to 14/4 instead of 14/- probably on account of our advance. A lot of our chaps were very rowdy last night and one chap was particularly bad with "horrors". Some of us were lucky enough to go into Amiens about 10 miles away on bikes. Went into town for a while and when I got back wrote part of a letter to Melv.<br/>15.7.16 First parade at 6.30 and a number of us were given half an hours saluting drill for not saluting when they received their pay. I didn't salute but somehow got out of it. met Price W.J. last night and other chaps. At 8 o'clock we went out for a bit of a march and sat on top of a hill returning at 11. Lovely day skylarks etc making things beautiful. Seems to be an aeroplane school close to here and about 30 were up in the air this morning all new type machines. At 1 parade there was a bit of a fuss as a chap had had 4 new razors stolen from him and the arrangement was that if they were not forthcoming at 6 o'clock there would be a kit inspection of the whole company and our leave would be stopped until they were found. However, the chap came round looking at our kits and was propitiated with several spare razors of ours and was fixed up. Finished Melv's letter and we talked in bed until about 11 but I couldn't sleep well as lice worried me. We knew we were to leave next day.<br/>15.7.16 Left about 12.30 behind the 10th &amp; 11th battalions and landed about 4.30 at Rubempre. we had a rotten billet but by making ourselves agreeable with the old lady we got a room in the house proper and we are very comfortable and don't mind how long we stay here.
