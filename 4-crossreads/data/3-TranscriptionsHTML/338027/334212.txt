<p>Monday, 19 July, 1915<br/>My guard was for twenty four hours, so when the others got leave I had to remain until six oclock at night, all the sisters went off to the 21st General Hospital I was agreeably surprised when one called me up onto the boat deck to say good bye, somehow nurses seem to see my failing.</p>
<p>Went for a feed and stroll when I was dismissed.  We have definite orders to rejoin our brigade for the big advance, but before we do we will need a lot of work as we are all soft, I weighed myself last night &amp; went 12 st. 3 lbs, a record weight.</p>
<p>Tuesday, 20 July, 1915<br/>I got dental leave in the a m &amp; went to the Deaconess Hosp, had one out and another temporary filling.  Then went on to Ramleh to the drivers, they have had new kits uniforms issued, their horses are very poor and if they keep them there much longer there will not be many left, but they all expect a move shortly.  Returned to town and had an enjoyable time, returned to boat found it had gone out in the stream so had to get rowed out to it.</p>
