1917 Sunday 20 May
A fine joyous day. Duties per usual. Afternoon off. Bath then sleep a little, read. Jockey sick   Wait on him. Over to cliff after tea & write up diary. Back to Y.M.C.A. to evening service. Tis when we sing the peerless old hymns of our church & childhood that the longing for home & kindred rushes upon one to be once more back to the old house haunts & faces.   How this heart cries out in longing for it all.  That this awful slaughter &  [indecipherable]  be stopped.  That at the wickedness that stalks abroad open & unashamed. War develops the beast in human beings to a shocking extent.   Is the war to be one of extermination? The Almighty's way of purging the race --- if so there are many to fall yet.
