One of our chaps went over to Flers early this morning got a great bundle of dry wood, with this he made a great fire opposite my dugout, we then got a can of petrol water put it on the fire, soon she was boiling merrily didn't we enjoy the tea, you have no idea how we miss our tea it means a lot to us I can tell you.
Last night nearly the whole of the Batt. were out digging a new communication trench to bring our wounded down on stretchers ("White Flare Alley") so called on account of the white chalky soil it passes through, it will be completed tonight will be a mile in length 3 ft wide 5 ft deep that's good going you know.
I have been very busy all the afternoon issuing sand bags, bombs, 303, flares, getting the picks shovels together, tins of reserve water, for tonight we are going to attack a very strong German position everyone has to carry something or other.
