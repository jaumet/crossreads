<p>Still Northward do we go.  The Southern Cross has left us.  The pole star is in full view.  The great bear takes his place, each night, as a brilliant setting in the Northern sky.  Monday evening, more than eight weeks out from Sydney should find us at Suez.  Thence through the canal will not take long.  At Port Said much the greater part of the voyage will have been negociated.</p>
<p>You should have seen my comedian at dinner tonight.  After soup and minor material he had jugged hare with r.c. jelly, when the plate was emptied of solids in went a finger of the left hand then one of the right to sweep along the remains and transfer it to the mouth to be licked off the digits.  As another course he had chicken with sauce, the fowl being gone his fingers made several attempts to reach the surface of the plate, only one did so, it was interesting to note the tendency displayed by the hands, then the plate was removed by the Steward.  It appears difficult for him to restrain his fingers.  I would be more comfortable were he further removed from me.</p>
<p>A cold breeze from the north today has given us the first suggestion of the Northern winter.  The cold in France must be great where the men have to stand to their guns in view of the enemy's forces.  The game of war is a savage dreadful affair, but it makes men great and races to change places on this planet.</p>
<p>Good night!  One wakes about 6 o'clock here.  I must to bed 11-50 p.m.</p>
<p>Good night!  Good night!!!  Good night!!!!!</p>
