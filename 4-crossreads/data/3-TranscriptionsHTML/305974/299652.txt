<p>2 Monday</p>
<p>Raining all day.  Done gas guard from 12.30 am till 3.30 pm, very monotonous. Great machine gun activity heard during the early morning.  As there seems to be a scarcity of candles we have to manufacture a few fat lamps (made by putting fat &amp; a wick in <strike>the jam</strike> a tin.  I am still looking out for some mail.  I wrote to Lilly Beck so I can expect a letter in a few days.</p>
<p>3 Tuesday<br/>The Germans occasionally bombard the village of Dickebusch, but only add more destruction to the damaged houses etc. I suppose at one time or another every structure has had a shell through it.  Cpt Bently exchanged places with Cpt Phillips, &amp; Pte Le Clerc went with Cpt Bently.  The Big 12" Howitza gun nearest here was removed during the very early hours of this morning.</p>
<p>4 Wednesday<br/>Done gas picket from 3.30 am till 6.30 am nothing startling occurred.  The artillary about here has been very quiet this last few days.  Still very wet, looks as if it has set in.  Very big bombs are used by the enemy on this front, thrown by trench mortars, they are known as rum jars by our fellows on account I suppose of being similar, there is absolutely no hope for any one who happens to be caught by one, they account for more deaths than wounded.</p>
