  
 10 a.m. passing through Villiers arriving at "H.Q's" - Bertangles at midday. The glorious weather the only saving quality - After dinner we erect bell tents and once again dwell under canvas. May 19th Sabbath - Letters to Home. "Elm Bank" & Wimbledon - Again meet Bill Smith - Jack Shaw & Algie Cooper - Original Poems - Clean & Pack costumes etc - Our new camp is in an ideal spot.
