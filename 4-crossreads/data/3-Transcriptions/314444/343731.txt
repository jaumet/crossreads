<p>France<br/>8/9/17</p>
<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>A few lines to let you know I am feeling tip top, in fact never felt better. I hope you are all very well at home.<br/>We are having plenty of rain, which makes the going a little uneven. Still we carry on very well and the supply system is wonderful;. You would not believe the work could be done so well, the boys work with a great heart.<br/>I expect you feel a bit upset about the Russians but dont worry, as the right boys will not move back. If it takes ten years we will "lick "em". I don't know what the Russians are afraid of, they have a good amount of Artillery but when you get up to them they are full of course that is too late with the right boys.<br/>Have not seen any of the boys from the Bay lately. My weight is just over fourteen stone and as hard as a rock, and good as ten square heads, any day.<br/>I hope you recieved the photos Miss Astin posted you. Remember me to all friends, Hoping you are all well, Best wishes &amp; love,<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom</p>
