<p>1915<br/>May. 9 Sun.<br/>Weather continuing very pleasant but flies very bad in the daytime.<br/>Church Service held at 2.15 p.m. out in the open air in front of the house.<br/>Our motor ambulances are in use every day &amp; are proving extremely useful on the splendid roads round Cairo, but the long runs they have to do eats up a tremendous lot of petrol so that expense is pretty solid.</p>
