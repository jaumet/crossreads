<p>Nice day &ndash; On duty to Estaire &ndash; Market day there &amp; it was a great sight &ndash; Most large Towns have a big square in the very heart, here the country folk gather from daylight &amp; take possessions of side walks etc &amp; erect awnings etc to sell their products. Fowls &ndash; Fruit &ndash; vegetables &ndash; meats &ndash; also<br/>Geo Kingsley &amp; I stopped a runaway horse<br/>make sausages &ndash; sweets &ndash; etc. Had a look thro the Town Hall &ndash; part of it is alotted YMCA, this is a very old building &ndash; the records of Mayors shows from 1789 &ndash; A fine big Church here must date back early into 1700.</p>
