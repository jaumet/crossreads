<p>My dear Belle.</p>
<p>I have just received your letter No 32., so my luck has been in lately in the4 way of letters &amp; parcels.</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear you are all well &amp; that you are happy.  Hope you will have a cool summer &amp; that mother will not feel it too much. Poor little Eddy is young to be troubled with toothache, hope he is alright now.  He is a man having a leather band in his hat.  How dreadful about poor old Edmund, he has bad luck &ndash; Hope you like the Photo I've sent you &amp; that you get them safely.  I'm feeling very well &amp; taking things very quietly.  Have no faithful male admirer at hand at present, so keeping very good hours.  Anyhow I shall always go very slowly while here now.  We have been very busy,</p>
