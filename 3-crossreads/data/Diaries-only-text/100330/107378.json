waiting awhile, nobody came so I investigated through the building could find nobody was just leaving when in walked a dilapidated Man asked of whom I wanted, after telling my wants he served me told me that the owner cleared out as the Germans were shelling the Town, the civil population are in a great state when shells are falling although the Town is full of Soldiers vehicles of all sorts they don't seem to mind. I went along afterwards to the Y.M.C.A. Building for a read when all of a sudden a large report of a Gun was plainly heard then a Whizz of a shell approaching then a terrific explosion in the Air, then everybody rushes out to see where the shrapnel has fallen, anyhow if any damage was done it was over to the West near the station, I learnt later that a High Explosive had fallen on the road opposite the Railway Station had struck a Motor Van, killing the Driver threw out his companion on to the Roadway, seriously injuring him also another shell
