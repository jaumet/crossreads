<p>when wounded. I must have been somewhat like the wild man from Borneo judging from the reflection of my appearance in the looking glass. I had it all removed except my moustache. This morning broke with a hot fusilade of shelling. I was up early and went down the ridge below where we had our guard room pit. It was lovely and cool &amp; the cooing of the doves was the only music to greet me until the guns burst out to spoil the strains of nature.</p>
<p>There are many funny names given to the different parts of our field of battle. Between the beach &amp; the firing line is Shrapnel Gully &ndash; a place very appropriately named owing to the amount that the enemy sent to that spot. Casualty Corner is another spot on the beach and [Indecipherable] which you must hurry as a Turkish sniper on a far ridge gives you a taste of his bullets.</p>
<p>Anzac Cove where nearly all our landing takes place now should be a celebrated spot in the future and no doubt looks or other Tourists [Indecipherable] will</p>
<p>[Footnote] Anzac is Australian New Z Army Corp</p>
