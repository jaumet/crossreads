<p>Dear Judge<br/>My last letter from you arrived over a month ago and was very welcome. Of course I knew all about Keith long ago. I got a lettes from him written when he was in London and replied to it. I wanted him in fact to send me a prismatic compass which I lent him in order that he might be able to find Berlin as he was desisting from the search, I thought I might as well use it in finding my way about the network of roads which covers this beloved country.</p>
