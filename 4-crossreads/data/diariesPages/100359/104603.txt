Estaires Baths.
Mail came in. Got letters from Mother, France and actually the "boy scout" spent a quiet evening in our billet and wrote some more to M.S.
Sunday 10th 
Baths going full steam ahead, thanks to Les Townsend who was on night shift and had the boilers nearly at "blowing up" point when the engineer arrived on the scene. More mail came in today, 2 lettersfrom Nell and 1 shortletter from L. "I am going into the garden to eat worms now" and somebody will know why. "Apre le Guerre"
Monday 11th
More mail came in. Got 2 letter glorious ones from M.S. and a very nice card, so the sun is shining once more" Weather getting cold and we appreciate our warm clothing. Things very quiet at the Baths. The bloomin? machinery is always breaking down.
Tuesday 12th
A.D.M.S. came round and inspected the Baths. "Molly" is strutting about like a Turkey cock, in a brand new uniform. Received cheque from M.S. There are about 30 of us working the baths and today we had 25 in for a Bath, so it's a might expensive wash our soldiers get. Stayed Home at night and wrote to M.S. which is always such a pleasant task. (Please don't think I'm leg-pulling" Mrs Moore just because you sent me that cheque which arrived today).
Wednesday 13th 
Saw a crowd of Engineers and "red caps" examining the Bridge over the canal this morning and wondered what was going to happen. My curiosity was shared by a good many as a big crowd soon gather. Presently the earth trembled and a big traction engine came along, hauling an enormous gun. The "heads" had examined the Bridge to see if it would bear the weight. They gave the driver the word and he steamed slowly on to the bridge until it had the full weight on, then he went, "full speed ahead" and one could almost hear the big crowd heave a sigh of relief when she reached the other side safely.
