<p>Main Camp, doing no damage to the Huts.   On Friday 29/3/18 at about 7 am a shell came over &amp; exploded a few feet off several small Huts &amp; the concussion tossing some of the boys out of their bunks.   One Sergeant in particular got a great shock as the shell exploded nearest his Hut, but during the day, he got over it &amp; signed on duty at 4 Pm as Shed Driver, between 6 &amp; 7 oclock this same Sergeant was walking along one of the Lines when a large shell exploded under the Bank &amp; blew backwards &amp; the concussion lifted the Sergeant off his legs &amp; he fell on to the rail &amp; sustained a broken rib &amp; minor injuries to the side of the head, he was soon placed on a stretcher &amp; taken away to the Hospital.   Fritz was evidently after this man having had two tries in one day for him.   The Base of the Shell flew up &amp; landed just over my hut &amp; buried itself down about 18 inches.   My chum next day dug it out &amp; handed it into the Orderly Room to be added to our Coy's Collection.</p>
<p>April 15th 1918.   During the last two weeks things in the Depot were very quiet, practically nothing doing.   As we had been expecting a move off at any moment, Rumors were about from day to day &amp; nothing eventuated.</p>
