<p>Kasr-el-Amy Hosp. Cairo<br/>19.6.15<br/>My dear Lizzie,<br/>I hope you havent thought I have quite forgotten you, but it is such a tiresome occupation writing in bed, another thing I havnt had any mail of any description for ten weeks so havnt much inclination to write, it is here in Cairo right enough for the Australian wounded dont get any at all it makes it harder when our English comrades all get theirs, it shows the vast difference in organisation, these Tommies certainly dont get much pay but it is made up to them in treatment they are looked after a treat, we are commonly called the ragtime army &amp; by gum it is ragtime too, the only thing &amp; redeeming feature is the way the boys can "scrap".<br/>My wounds are doing famously except to be able to walk shortly I can get about on crutches a bit now, it is very monotonous here in bed &amp; it is a lot different to being in Lewisham Hospital.<br/>Well Lizzie dear I will close now with love to self R &amp; B. from your loving brother<br/>Ken</p>
