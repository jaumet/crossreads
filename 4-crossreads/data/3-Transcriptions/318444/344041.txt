<p>At last I am away with a draft.<br/>Left Acoz with our portion of the No 10 Quota &amp; put up for the night at Corp Concentration Camp at Marcinelle, Charleroi.</p>
<p>Thurs Feb 13th:-<br/>Left Charleroi by train after getting a "Tea Leaved" lot of "Johnnie Walker" aboard. Passed through Mons, Valenciennes, St Ghislan &amp; Amiens.</p>
<p>Fri Feb 14th:-<br/>Pulled up at a siding near Havre &amp; marched to the Aust Gen Base depot late tonight.</p>
<p>Sun Feb 16th:-<br/>The tents in this camp are in a filthy condition with the old gear, food &amp; blankets lying about &amp; the wet conditions. A number of us are lying out with the flu &amp; we are chary about reporting sick as the draft is liable to move across to Eng at any time &amp; so we would miss it.</p>
<p>Mon 17th Feb:-<br/>Still got the dog's disease but hanging out in case the quota moves.</p>
