Saturday 8 April 1916A beautiful bright day with a very decided nip in the air. The postponed inspection by the camp commandant was held, the massed parade of the 3000 or so men on the hillside making a fine picture. After passing up & down the lines he addressed the men calling attention to the fine work already done by Australians & to what yet remains to be done. After the inspection 50 of my men who had been taken from us at Aerodrome & sent on by the "Saxonia" to the 2nd Divn. joined up again with the company. The tents for officers were put up & in the afternoon we moved into them from the hut, Mr Prescott & I being together in one : he had just been appointed Q.M. Stayed in camp for each meal & at night - a beautifully clear starlight night with a nip of frost in it - went down town to purchase eatables, getting back about 9 o'c.
