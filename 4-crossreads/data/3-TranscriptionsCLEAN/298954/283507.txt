Tue.  Aug 14th.We had scarcely anchored when the "Matunga" people came along to her stern and commenced throwing us apples, (a little practice which our Hun hosts quickly stopped.)
Conspicuous amongst them was a vision in white with emerald silk stockings and a very purple sunshade.  We stared; - it is a long time since we saw anything like that.
"Regulations" came into force again here with great severity.
We are to be below at sunset every night.   Willie the Beautiful read us the orders and told us that if we tried to escape the guard would "us shoot" but if we should happen to dodge the guard the natives finish us "being uncultivated and cannibal"     The hatch is now covered in with mosquito netting and work has already commenced on the "Matungas" cargo.
