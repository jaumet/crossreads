<p>It looks as if we are going to pinch him out of Albert. Tomorrow we move down to camp on the river but may move again at an hour's notice.</p>
<p>Friday 23rd Aug.<br/>Had the hun over last night bombing &amp; on our left we attacked again, the guns opening up at 5 A.M. Prisoners began to come through early &ndash; 1400 with 33 officers was the first count. We also attacked on the other side of Albert &amp; the French near Soissons. Congrats received from Gen. Rawlinson on the stunt just finished. Came down to the new camp &amp; after fixing up the panniers, loaded my medical wagon returning to old camp for lunch. During afternoon left for new camp near river. Had a swim after tea. Had to dig in as we had no possies, my possy is now 6 ft 6 in long &amp; 2 ft deep so should be O.K. except for a direct hit. He was over bombing during the night &amp; at 1 A.M. we opened up with a heavy barrage so expect the enemy counterattacked. A Hun prisoner told us that there are 15 Austrian Divisions on this front. He had lived for 10 yrs in London &amp; was very interesting saying that Aussie prisoners were working on his farm. He was glad to be a prisoner.</p>
