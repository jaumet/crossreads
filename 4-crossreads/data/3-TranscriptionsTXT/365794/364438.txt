Wednesday 7 February 1917 [6 February 1918]Duty 7.30 a.m. as usual & oh for a little less bustling by Sister Peile.  A type of often meets in nursing, not of any polish or kindly sympathy - never a word as to how any little ailment may be & apparently never has any illness herself.  The boys I love as usual they come to me for all their little wants and I do my best for them as regards gramophones etc. but the grams require much attention to get a tune from them.
