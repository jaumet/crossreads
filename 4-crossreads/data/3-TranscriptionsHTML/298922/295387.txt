<p>Friday 2 March 1917</p>
<p>More lectures on how to win the war. Our instructors are men who have been through the MILL in France. It would cost a man about 100/-/- to go through a Cavalry School like this in Australia as <strike>a volunteer yet some Officers waste their time in a drunken stupor. If I could I should like to keep up soldiering "apres la guerre".</strike>. This School teaches one all the up to date schemes learnt from sad experience in France &amp; elsewhere.</p>
