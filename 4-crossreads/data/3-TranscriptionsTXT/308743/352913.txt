Stables at 6First parade was telephones for the Troop along the canal, the Boss was out on his bike capturing men up trees etc! Motor bikes were passed for repair at last.

The team is to move on Saturday to Luton loading to be done on Friday. Wind has been high all day and indications of rain is now noticeable but will as usual pass off.The CO failed to recommend Toby's application until [indecipherable] got on to his lug & now has changed his mind we have put in another from home through the High Commissioner of Australia. Leave stopped for two days on account of a Mohammad [indecipherable] Bed at 9
