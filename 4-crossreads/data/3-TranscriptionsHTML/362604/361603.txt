<p>Motor Bike as all the fittings were new.  But it is just as well out of the road.  I would not have messed about with any more.</p>
<p>I should not write anything to Uncle Harry.  He has usurped everything &amp; is cunning enough to have it all in His own name.  He must be very wealthy.  He is as mean as a man can possibly be &amp; He got the whole of the &amp;pound;1600 that Granpa left exclusive of the farm &amp; the whole of the Stock.  He knows all about the way to get what is His &amp; all His Brothers &amp; Sisters share to.  Not one of the Family got the smell of an oil rag.  He has just usurped the whole lot of course He worked round Grandma all the time &amp; She is old &amp; God help Her, thinks that He is the whitest.  She even forgave Him for marrying Her servant &amp; a woman that Gran hated.</p>
