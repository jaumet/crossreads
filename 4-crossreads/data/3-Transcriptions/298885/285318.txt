<p>May 4th &ndash; 19<br/>Reveille at 2AM yesterday we proceeded to London arriving at 8.30. Marched to concentration area at Hyde Park and had a couple of hours leave.</p>
<p>After lunch we were lined up and waited for the 5000 Canadians to move off. Then Aussies followed (5000) after us came the New Zealanders South Africans and Newfoundlanders. Fortunately it turned out to be a sunny afternoon although the prospects of the morning were anything but bright</p>
