<p>Wednesday 21 March</p>
<p>Slept in the double bed again last night.  Today has been spent in getting straight and cleaning out the buildings.  Tonight all stretcher-bearers were cleared out of Bapaume and I went with a party along the Rue de Peronne to the village of Beaulencourt.  When working out from Bernafay Wood through Delville Wood this village was opposite us in Fritz's lines.  Now it is nothing but a heap of ruins.  All fruit trees have been cut down.  We sleep in a German Dugout tonight running under a heap of bricks which once was a house.  Trees along the Bapaume-Peronne Road have been cut down.  Mine craters are also along this road.</p>
