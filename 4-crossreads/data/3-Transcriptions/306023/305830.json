<p>10th Sunday.<br/>Went to Mass in the morning.</p>
<p>More kit inspections and fooling around. I am having a job to keep on the draft as I am unmistakeably an 'immature'. I think I can kid Stan Eastment to leave me on though.</p>
<p>Had a yarn with Father Lonergan again.</p>
<p>11th<br/>Very little doing but more inspections. I got a letter from the Bank to say that at last something had arrived for me.</p>
