  
 Monday April 30th There is plenty of recreation here, there are two lovely billiard tables, & plenty of reading, including Australian literature & books. The trees are all beginning to bud, & it is marvellous how quickly they grow too. Put in for a late pass but got a knock back. 
 Tuesday May 1st English people seems to get very excited over the first call of the cuckoo, which they say is the sign of spring. A lovely day. Very quiet. 
 Wednesday May 2nd Went for a very nice walk. Was watching the means of getting barges through the canals & locks, it was very interesting. As we are to go to Weymouth tomorrow we have to draw kit at 6 pm this afternoon. 
 Thursday May 3rd Fell in at 8.30 am & caught a train to Paddington station London, where we caught an express train for Weymouth; & my word it did travel too, at times I reckon we done 60 miles an hour easy. It was a beautiful trip & everywhere along the line was lovely & green. Upon arrival here, we were conveyed to Monte Video Camp by motors. We are in shacks here. It is a very big camp. This is the last camp for those embarking for Australia.
