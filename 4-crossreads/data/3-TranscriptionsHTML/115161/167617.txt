<p>one, decided to vacate the premises, under the impression that at last the enemy had determined to destroy the buildings.&nbsp; No sooner had they got outside than a shell exploded amongst them, killing three outright, and wounding sixteen others.&nbsp; The sight is one that I can never efface from my memory.&nbsp; Two more died on the way to the &quot;dressing station&quot; leaving fourteen wounded, many seriously.</p>
<p>This happening at such a time, (on the eve of our attack) appears as an evil omen.&nbsp; Our spirits fell, and our nerves were much shaken.&nbsp; However, gruesome as it was, we could not allow our minds to dwell on this painful subject.</p>
<p>The one man who remained in the billet unhurt, was a chap who took things as they came, never seemed to worry over anything, always full of fun, and ever ready with a joke, even in the most serious predicaments.&nbsp; On this occasion he refused to leave the billet with the others stating that if he had to be killed he would at least die in as reasonable comfort as possible.&nbsp; He was not going out in the cold, to avoid a shell which after all might not have &quot;his number&quot; on it.&nbsp; Not he!&nbsp; If a shell was intended for him, let it come to him, he was just as safe there and far more comfortable.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never seen that chap &quot;windy&quot; or excited, but I&#39;ve seen him absolutely fagged out, as I will tell later.&nbsp; Tired, yes! even too tired for him to crack a joke.&nbsp; He was rough, very rough, but a better hearted fellow never breathed.</p>
<p>If I had been with them at this time I should most undoubtedly have gone with the majority, outside.&nbsp; I was always a bit &quot;windy&quot;.&nbsp; So my one-stripe on this occasion in all probability saved my life.&nbsp; I was absent from the billet very little more than half an hour.</p>
<p>We had our tea, a very gloomy meal, we none of us felt over lively, it might be the last time that we should meet again in such a way.&nbsp; The conversation was centred on the events of the afternoon, and for a while took our minds off the horrors which tomorrow might have in store for us.</p>
