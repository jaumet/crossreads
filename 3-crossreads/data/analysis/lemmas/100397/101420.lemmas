 he would eventu get to like it , and I guess that it would suit him better than the coast , as for his idea of join the L.H. well I do n't , fanci he would have a possibl hope . he has never done ani ride , and would find , that , be amongst horsemen was not the sweetest , of job if you dont understand look after your mount on some of the Station , in the Nor West . a book keeper job is not too bad on other a book K. has to be a general handi man , abl to ride help muster , count sheet , etc . If he could secur someth of that sort , he would find , befor long that the dri climat out from the coast , was far better for him than st "guess I 'm tri to write and listen to some of the lad talking" . I would have tri to run him onto someth of that sort , when I came down from Q . But H. is a hard chap to advis , and as he had that Busi in hand , I did n't like say anyth or anoth good line is the forward agenc busi , it would also Suit H. now . Wright H Co. are allway on the look out for place to open new branch , in part that are just or are be open up by new Rlys The manag at Headquart if he took a fanci to H. would fix him up for they have to enlarg their staff when they open a new branch , You have a yarn to Dott . when you are over at Mossman 's again and see if She doe not think Mr. B. would do as I say . Say we re have a high old time here , just at present , you ve read in the paper of FATIGUE Work and you have also seen Photo of Australian engag on them
