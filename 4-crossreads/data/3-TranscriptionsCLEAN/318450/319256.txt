  
 about 7 week's in which time I moved into about 3 different wards.  At this place I had an operation which I soon got over. 
 I may say at this hospital we had a lot more leave than we did at Leicester, and besides the sisters being Australian understood our way's. 
 I had a real good time at Southall during my stay, besides making a few friend's and any way I was real sorry to leave it. 
 From Southall I went on my furlough, which I had being praying for. 
 I went to Bonnie Scotland to Glasgow first after spending about a week there I made tracks back to Edinburgh which I may say I like much better than Glasgow, as Glasgow is a commercial city and Edinburgh
