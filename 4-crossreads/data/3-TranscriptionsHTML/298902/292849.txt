<p>our mess went to an evening at the big farmhouse of the village.  We decided to dress up in some new pierrot concert costumes for the occasion, &amp; it was a great success.  About 8 oclock we all marched in, one behind the other with hands on shoulder into the room where all the girls etc were sitting, circled the table then turned &amp; bowed with a Bon Soir.  The effect was great, &amp; the dress, pink &amp; black looked well.  It was an extraordinary night.  First some music &amp; singing by the girls, fairly rough, then some dancing until about 11 oclock we began to look for supper.  12 oclock came &amp; still no sign &amp; we were famishing.  By this time we were saying fearful things  to one another about coming thuds etc &amp; made much fun of it.  At last at 1 A.M. we were conducted to a room &amp; received coffee &amp; tart so all was well again &amp; we went home quite happy about 2 A.M.</p>
