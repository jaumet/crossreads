Tuesday 20 March 1917 [19 March 1918]Fifteen of our pts. go out today & wards at stagnation point.  One's patience & hope are sorely tried with a sister in charge who is both rude & incompetent though with one good trait, very good as to time of returning to ward, never late but the three of them so deadly uninteresting and cold.
