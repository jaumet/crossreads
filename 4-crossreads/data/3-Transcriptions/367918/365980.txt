<p>Dear Judge,<br/>I have just had a letter from Professor Holme, telling me that you had mentioned me to him. That was awfully decent of you. When the educational scheme started to come into force I hesitated about applying for an English University course because I was not sure as to the pecuniary situation &amp; thought that it would be very</p>

<p>difficult to get. But as I was very keen to do something I compromised and put in for a job with a Scottish solicitor Mr Scott Moncrieff of Edinburgh &ndash; who offered me a place in his office and an opportunity to attend University lectures on Roman law outside of office hours.</p>
<p>Professor Holme told me he thought I would get it all right but asked if I didn't think a University course would be better. As I am going on leave in a week I am going to</p>
<p>see him and be advised.</p>
<p>Just at present I'm laid up with a touch of sinivitis. Don't know what I've done to merit this as I haven't played football for the last month. However its going on all right.</p>
<p>Your chocolate is still arriving O.K. You know, Judge, you spoil me in every way.</p>
<p>Haven't heard anything of Caesar for donkey's ages.</p>
<p>Life at present is very dull &ndash; all the old officers have gone and their places taken by those who have just arrived from Australia. The Educational scheme is the only thing that is keeping me alive.</p>
<p>For a while they had me on Bde H.Q. understudying the Staff Captain but when they amalgamated the 1st &amp; 2nd Bdes I was not necessary and was very glad to get back to the Bn.</p>
<p>I had 19 days in Brussels with the Bn band and my experiences there would fill a book &ndash; so I wont attempt to describe them.</p>
<p>My love to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; Dorothy &amp; salaams to Keith</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>[indecipherable]</p>
