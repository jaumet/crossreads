 Dear Madam, In reply to your letter dated 9th August, I beg to inform you that the "Somali" evacuated sick and wounded at Malta on the 31st July, but the actual rolls of the sick and wounded evacuated have not yet reached us by post, but if Sgt. Hickson was not transferred from the ship you might take it for granted that he landed at Malta on the 31st July, 
 Yours faithfully, Hindmarsh [?] Major. D.A.A.G. (D). 3rd Echelon, M.E.F. 
 Hotel Metropole, Alexandria, 12/8/15.
