24 June 1918 MondayHaving Conscription the New Zealanders are able to send big batches of men away for a spell & get reinforcements from Moascar by the hundreds.  We can send no one & get reinforcements at the rate of 2 per Squadron etc: & these are often patched up men or the regular waster who does the rounds of the Hospitals etc:- never doing more than a fortnight with the Reg's- & hoping a new Doctor will be on duty each time he does the round.  But we don't have more than 2 or 3 of these sort per Troop Thank goodness.
