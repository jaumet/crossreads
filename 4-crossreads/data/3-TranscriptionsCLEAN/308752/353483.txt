  
 home, just for bravado & skite & self praise; nothing of the sort,  the reason is - that I thought it a good idea to keep an account of my experiences etc. so that when I return I will be able to explain things more fully & also in years to come it will be interesting to look back & read the account.  It is not only myself who has been through the experiences recorded here but the majority of the Bearers of our Unit. Although the latter have suffered during this time in the straffing, we still remain the "Lucky 8th" when compared with other Australian Ambulances. 
 The previous account of my doings ended on the 22nd August the day that I returned to the Unit from leave to England. 
 August 23rd to 28th. The same old routine as before, a little drill & fatigues each day, but naturally after just coming back from England I cold not settle down to this military life for a couple of days. But of course it does not take long to get in the same old groove again. Very frequently I went for a stroll in the evenings, the twilight was very pleasant, & the country was looking at its best. 
 August 29th 17. Review held by our Division, Sir Douglas Hair taking the salute. It was indeed a grand sight, it brought back memories of that Review held by General Mackay at Ferry Post, Egypt on the 25th May 1916. But alas, how man men I wonder attended the 2nd review who were with the Division in Egypt. 
 August 31st. A nine mile route march before dinner full pack up, just to keep us fit.
