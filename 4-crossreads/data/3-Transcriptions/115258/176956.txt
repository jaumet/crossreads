<p>been in it. There is a good account in the Kaiora Cooee news of this regts scrap with the Germans. I was jolly sorry to miss that as it seems to have been one of the easiest scraps we have had, although the shelling after it was very awful. Nearly all the chaps who were in it now have an automatic revolver or a German watch. I wonder whats doing re Cooyal. I do hope this season is good and you are able to bug James! Pity a taube could not fly over and drop an egg on Kermonds, but I suppose you will get him out of that in time. Did you subscribe to Mrs Ryan&#39;s Red Cross Benefit? I hear there is a mail soon to arrive so will write again then. Love to Mother &amp; Fred. I am Your loving Son Robert C Wilson</p>
