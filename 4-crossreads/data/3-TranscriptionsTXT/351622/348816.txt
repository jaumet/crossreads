24 April 1916 Easter MonThree German aeroplanes brought down & two British. More Africans arrive. Spent most of the day in the estaminet with Marsh, Keith, Sid. All making best of Easter Monday as possible. Enjoyed a good tea of steak & chips. Big concert to-night in the mess-room tendered to us by one of the Tommie Ambulance.
25 April 1916 Easter TuesMy first thoughts on waking this morning were those of Gallipoli & the memorable landing that happened twelve months to-day. Yes they were up against it this time last year. Packed up & left Steenwerck 5 p.m. going to an old farm where we expect to stay for a week or so. We are now about 1 1/2 mile out of Steenwerck. Fairly comfortable but not as much as our last place.
