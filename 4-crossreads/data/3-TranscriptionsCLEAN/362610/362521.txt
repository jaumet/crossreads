  
 Wednesday 1 Nov. 1916 Up at 4 & breakfast by 5, then up the line with the General & Major Dyer. The morning was fine but towards midday the sky became overcast & a little rain fell in the afternoon which was followed by a wet night. Conditions up the line were simply awful, & we arrived home in a fearful state, mud everywhere. Stood by here during the afternoon, there being very little to do.
