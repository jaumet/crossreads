  
 Thur. 23rd 
 A bright fine morning but chilly. We were wakened this morning at 2.30 AM, marched to the pier again and after waiting about 4 hours go aboard a train which had just brought in some other poor chaps to go on leave to dear old Blighty. Last night I went down to the YMCA to see if I could liven up a bit & heard a very interesting lecture on New Guinea by a missionary who spent 8 years in a native town there with his wife the only white companion during all this time. It must be very rough in the channel now as a good breeze is blowing and making large waves in the harbour on which the sea gulls float, glorying in it
