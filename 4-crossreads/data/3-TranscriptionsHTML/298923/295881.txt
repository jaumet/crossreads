<p>3 August 1918 Saturday<br/>You will have "cable" re D.S.O. by this, it means I wear 3 ribbons now, &amp; the D.S.O. is worth having-   I hope to have my leave in a week.<br/>Good news from France.<br/>I wish Joe was here but even if he is allowed to join it will take 6 mos. to train him &amp; ere that it may be all over, let us hope so.  Went Cavalry School Richon for dinner &amp; Polo, part of the School itinery is to give young Officers a decent Start.  Both English &amp; Australian Officers are mixed up together.</p>
