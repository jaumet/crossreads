 22.3.15 Mon. 22nd.  General inspection of the Division by Sir Henry McMahon this morning, &amp; it was a grand sight.  The second time we marched past was at a gallop &amp; we were lucky enough to be in a good line as we went past Sir Henry;  even the nurses from the Heliopolis hospital were there.  We arrived back in camp about one oclock, &amp; had nothing to do but "stables" all the afternoon, after tea Cork &amp; I had a game of billiards &amp; then went to the pictures, but they were nothing to write home about.
