<p>22-2-16<br/>Tue 22nd<br/>Went down to B Troop today as escort to the transport &amp; had a very interesting time; brought a mail down from the station with us on our way back; The Col. Adj. &amp; all the Officers went away for dinner today &amp; had a troop as escort; The Col. &amp; Officers all got rather merry &amp; after dinner 4 or 5 natives were showing our men how the Senoussi's fight galloping on ponies &amp; firing as they went ; The Col. told the Adj to show them one better so he ordered the troop to mount &amp; fix bayonets &amp; charge mounted, They say they had a fine days sport, &amp; there are always plenty of volunteers to go on any of these trips</p>
