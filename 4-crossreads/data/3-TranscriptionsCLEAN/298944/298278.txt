  
 Tuesday night 
 Since last writing my round has been simply work (military & educational) & sleep. 
 During the night I do preparation work or write parodies for the concert, or learn some shorthand when there is nothing to be done in the way of attending to patients. A few influenza cases may be relied upon every night, but beyond that there are not spent many cases - that is wounded. 
 Tonight there has been a raid in which our boys wore certain kinds of hats. The number of wounded was only about half a dozen, & of those only one was serious. We seem to have dealt with 4 worrying machine guns.
