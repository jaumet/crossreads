<p>MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot, but came up a baby</p>
<p>storm at night. Got &nbsp; points.</p>
<p>I lopped in 4D, Middle &amp; Mountain</p>
<p>paddocks, &amp; then started cutting</p>
<p>the cotton bush in Wheelers.</p>
<p>Tickle had the poison cart working</p>
<p>in Mountain &amp; Boundary.</p>
<p>Peter started the 4D sheep at</p>
<p>Abbottslea.</p>
<p>Harold Barnes came out and</p>
<p>took my wool in 35 bales.</p>
