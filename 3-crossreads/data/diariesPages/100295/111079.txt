2nd October:
I sent in my resignation this morning await the result of igniting the fuse. It is disheartening, after striving to secure the impossible running all hazards to meet with little encouragement. I am unwilling will not make a display of war pictures unless the military people see their way clear to give me a free hand. Canada has made a great advertisement out of their pictures I must beat them. If I am unable to do so, then I would be quite willing to accede to the Military wishes. 
I went up with my new assistant - a lad of promise ?
