1915Dec 26th SundayA quiet Sunday. Very tired &  after church rest until afternoon, then taking a trip to the Pyramids
Last night we had tea with Madame Alice &  the girls &  some music    &  entertainment afterwards. It was indeed a pleasant change.
Dec 27th MondayAgain night duty from 12 midnight to 7 am. As the weather is very cold it is not only unpleasant but miserable trying to work all night wrapped up in our greatcoats.
Dec 28th to Dec 30thPlenty of work & no amusement. Nothing but sleep & work so not very interesting.
