played a few good selections up on deck, & after that a lot of us joined in & had a dance it was very good we kept it up till 9 pm when the bugal sounded for lights to go out so we went down for our hammocks & brought them up to sleep on deck as it was very hot.  We had just got nicely settled when a very heavy shower of rain came on, you never saw such a devil of a scatter in all your life as the hatch is not very large & it put me in mind of about 50 rabbits all trying to get into the same hole at once.  Anyhow those who did not get down were shoved or pushed down & by the time all the pushing was over the rain had stopped.  Well this morning we were all pleased to see a bit of land once more, us the first we have seen since we left Australia.  It is the south coast of "Ceylon".  We expect to reach "Colombo" about midday. Well we arrived at 2.30 pm & anchored & were well protected by Gun boats.  There is a large Russian Cruiser not very far from us at present.  "Colombo" from the distance is a very gay looking place.  We can see the principal Hotels in the distance they are surrounded by Lawns & trees which gives the place a very actracting apperance.
