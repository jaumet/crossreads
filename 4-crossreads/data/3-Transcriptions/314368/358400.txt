<p>bit discontented to have to go back to the old life.</p>
<p>I think I have told you what a real good time I had in hospital up at Northampton. I made quite a lot of friends up there, and the letters I get from them together with those from my London friends all help to make me feel much more at home, over this side, than I have for a long time. I think I told you that my doctor at Northampton was a lady, she was very good to me and it was through her that I got to know Mrs Purey Cust, my kind hostess and best of friends in London, Mrs Cust was such a dear woman she made me feel just as much at home as it was possible to do, and it felt almost like leaving home again when I came away. Mrs.Cust was not very strong, so she invited a couple of her nieces down from Lincoln to spend a week or two with her, so that I would have some one to take me around, and show me the sights of London, You can guess what a jolly time I had and there was not much that we did not get to see. Also the girls were able to get permission to show me around many places that I would never have been able</p>
