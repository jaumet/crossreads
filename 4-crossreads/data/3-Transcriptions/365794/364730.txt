<p>Thursday 22 November 1917<br/>Miss Germain's wedding day &amp; such a beautiful one.  Clear &amp; just a touch of winter in the air &ndash; wedding 4 p.m., honeymoon spent at ... 17 miles away.  Married in Garrison Church at No. 14 A.G.H.  Her letter to us was fine.  My dear "Children" &amp; signed Mollie Germain, her last signature on our noticeboard under that name.<br/>Went No. 14 5.30 p.m. all friends out.  Now this place is my home as it were &amp; I feel it so and have settled down into it all.  The bugle calls, weird voices of the natives, long lines of tents &amp; everywhere men, men are becoming part of my daily life &amp; it is hard to imagine myself back at "Wilga".  Such lovely nights if only one had someone to go out with.</p>
