Jack Wills I had to go to Shick Allam to try our lines of communications today, we left early on the bikes everything went well for the first 15 miles. Shick Allam was reached in due course as we got there so early, we decided to push on to Beit Khalef the going now for miles was frightful we got 1 puncture 1 blow out on account of the holes, struck the squadron by chance Jack Wills then got another puncture I pushed on to the hill set up the helio straight away called they answered immediately, carried on for about an hour then left for home but I hadn't gone 200 yards when I got another blow out so I rode her on the rim for a mile, fixed her up then off we set, put another 10 miles behind us I went whof into another hole still another blow out, the heat at this time

was well on 190 in the sun the tyres were too hot to hold fixed that up with the last bit of rubber we had left got under way once more when about 2 miles out of here (Sohag) Jack W pulled up alongside me to tell that his tyre was again flat in doing so got his bars caught in mine didn't we come a beaut, nobody hurt machines undamaged, he had to stop so I sent Watty out with a new tube. I got into camp at 2 oclock burnt to a cinder, the C O couldn't believe that we had been at Khalaf when he was convinced was quite pleased at our doings. Horses went out as usual to the palms Signalling class went on as usual. I was posted to take charge of Sig office at Bde H Qs so now am billeted in a brick house. Bed at nine thirty.
Mail tomorrow.
