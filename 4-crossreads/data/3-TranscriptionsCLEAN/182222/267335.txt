He stopped and, looking down into the pool                Wherein we stood, he said " This  That hole's too wet!"         Then squatting down beside a blazing gun,                        He turned his face  up to  towards the yellow moon             He  chattered with a     said  asked with a grimace of childish fun,                                                                                     "D'ye think this bloddy war'll be over soon?"
