  
 Town Hall & the gendarmerie. I go there & get a billet for night in Hotel de l'Esperance which costs me nothing. I do not relish sleeping in a rough military blanket on the floor when a comfortable bed between sheets is to be had for the asking. 
 However not liking the look of the hotel & hearing that if I went to any large house & asked for accomodation I could receive it so I walked down the Boulevard near the river & when I had selected the biggest house I went in & asked for owner noting on my way that the word "notaire" appeared on the plate. Monsieur was not in but Madame told me I could speak before her as before her husband. I explained what I had heard & she immediately showed me a room or rather the maid did. I told her I would be back about 9 & left. 
 In the town I met an English officer & together we went to Cafe Central which consists of one large room with a balcony running round the top. On ground floor dancing takes place & partners are anyone you like. The orchestra renders good music & in intervals there is two or more paid singers who sing & then make a collection on their own behalf. The scene is lively but the mirth is forced a little it seems to me & has not the spontaneousness one finds in a Parisian cafe perhaps this is due to the English element or to the proximity
