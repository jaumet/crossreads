HOME AGAIN
Leicestershire Troops Landed.

The South Australian troops by the steamer Leicestershire were landed at the Outer Harbour at the expected time – 11 o’clock on Wednesday morning. As the special train from Adelaide to meet the vessel did not leave until 10.32 a.m. relatives travelling by that train were too late to witness the arrival of the vessel, and most of the men had landed. About 10 minutes after the disembarkation had started a tremendous cheer was sent up by the soldiers on board. The crowed opened up a passage way, and Mr. "Sammy" Lunn arrived beathlessly on the scene. He was the "important personage" who had received a greeting which was a record one coming from a visiting troopship. Led by Mr. Lunn the crowd which had then gathered returned the greeting. Lieut. A.B. Mortimer, the disembarkation officer, was assisted by Lieut. A. Mitchell and Staff Sgt. A.N. Gardiner, Sgt. W.J. Stephens boarded the vessel at the anchorage, and addressed the men on repatriation, Returned Soldiers’ Association, and army reserve. The War Duchess and the wharf were decorated with flags in honour of the soldiers’ return, and the Y.M.C.A. department, assisted by the ladies of the V.A.D. provided refreshments and "smokes" in the No. 1 shed. The South Australians were briefly welcomed by Major J.J. Hughes, A.P.M., on behalf of the State Commandant (Brig.-Gen. J.M. Antill, C.B., C.M.G.) owing to illness, the Mayor of Port Adelaide (Mr. R.H. Smith) was not present. Lieut. P. Buller represented the District Naval Officer (Capt. C.J. Clare, C.M.G.). Lieut. L.C. Colley commanded the military guard, and W.O. Guthrie was in charge of the naval men. Wharf leave was granted to the eastern State men, who to the number of 960 were entertained at tea by the Y.M.C.A. between 3.30 p.m. and 4 p.m. in the No. 1 shed, after which they listened to an enjoyable concert in the new Y.M.C.A. Hall at the harbour. Selections played on the wharf in the morning by the District Military Band under W.O. Stanley were greatly appreciated by the soldiers.
