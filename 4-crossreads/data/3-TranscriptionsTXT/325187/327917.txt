[Friday 23 June 1916]Left Ognatina 5.30 pm for Romani, the whole Brigade fatigued.My Horses stood it well-  met 2 Turks Camel Patrol both ran.Men's minds work differently when called after a sleep at a Halt- on the march- One man charged the N.C.O. who woke him- thought TURKS .  Jumped up once & ran in my sleep the opposite way to my horse-We halt for 10 minutes every hour- & all nearly go to sleep, as we are doing the round of the clock.  - aviator & observer WALKED to our outposts, from Machine.I've got a bit of the propeller as a small mementoe of a big perish-Arrived Romani midnight
