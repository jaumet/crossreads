<p>Between 8 &amp; 9 p.m. tonight the sky was in first class order for making observations in regard to the stars.  I was talking to Jerom about them, telling him how the Scorpio, sh[in]ing his best in the Southern sky could be seen by you each night in the same way as we were then looking at it, and that oft in the stilly night reminder of home and Macquarie Street was refreshed in my mind by the viscious looking tail.   The great Dog was clear in his hurried chase across the firmament in this attempt pick up with the scorpions tail, a run he has been having for many thousands of years without getting appreciably nearer to this objective; this is a much more striking constellation in these lattitude than in yours because here the dog stands correctly from the observers point of view while with you he is on his back.   I have been looking out for Orion in the Southern sky recently, but it has not been visible when my eyes were skyward raised.   Good night!! Good night!!! Good night!!!!!<br/>&nbsp;[A line of Xs and Os.]<br/>Carrie. Josie. Kitty.</p>
<p>31.7.15  11.20 p.m..   Hurrah!! Hurrah!!!!! Hurrah!!!!!<br/>Two letters from you one from Tabbie the other from Joe.   From the former, dated 19 &amp; 20.6.15, from the latter 19 &amp; 20.5.15.   Just one month of interval.   To answer the earlier first.</p>
<p>Joseph dear: Thanks for the happy returns for my birth anniversary.  The cable came to hand all right.  For it too many thanks also.  I fear me that there is in store for you in the immediate future to read casualty lists the like of which have not been seen in the papers before.  In the early fight of April the valour of the soldiery coming from Australia surprised and disorganised the Turks, but acquaintanceship will have taught such valliant men as the enemy in Galipoli that even the Australian has to be fought upon his merits, and well lead and trained there is no more stubourn enemy than the soldiers who fight under the banner of Mahomed, on many a well contested field they have proved the mettle that is in them, so be not disappointed if long before this is in your hands my words have come true.</p>
<p>This afternoon I had a visit from General Legge, he and I are old friends, he wanted to be allowed to place some horses in stables that are attached to my hospital, I have arranged for him to do so, in return I asked him to purchase some drugs that I urgently require, he has phoned me tonight that that they can be bought.</p>
