It is a marvel if no rain falls here for 3 days.  <strike>The</strike> It has been bitterly cold with strong winds blowing, &amp; I have been very thankful for my warm clothing &amp; especially the sheepskin vest.  We are expecting to move again to-morrow, perhaps for the last time, &amp; I will be glad when we get to work &amp; get settled.  Owing to reorganisation, I am leaving the Transport as far as I know at</p>
