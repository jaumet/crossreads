  
  Gallipoli  11.10.15 - Captain Herbert has the reputation of being the finest Intelligence Officer on the Peninsula. 
 A distinguishing feature of the night operations lately has been the work of the Australian patrols - 7th Australian Infantry Brigade (Colonel Burston).  They have penetrated the enemy's lines at night and actually sneaked in and out their trenches with wonderful daring and skill.  They successfully reconnoitred the enemy's position at the "Apex" and entered the blockhouse there.  This work has been commended by General Godley.  The cold callousness of the Australians to danger is typified by the following incident - A Turkish deserter - Suleman Achmud - who walked in and laid down his arms a couple of days back, when asked the question as to whether the Turks saw any of our men or patrols at night answered "only when we see them smoking cigarettes."  Though this is an unpardonable crime for a soldier on patrol duty, it only conveys a slight conception of what these fellows do.  They are utterly reckless and never think of the imminent danger surrounding them - they stand up in their trenches, lean over and show half the body to get a better smack at a Turkish sniper or other enemy target - they ignore and brush aside all regulations governing trench fighting.  They take their own initiative and perhaps their continued success has been a great deal due to this.  "They are too eager" said an Artillery Officer of twenty-five years experience the other day, "yet they are brilliant soldiers." 
 With regard to the Turkish prisoner mentioned above, he walked into the trenches at dawn and with a characteristic expression of disgust threw down his rifle and said "me finished".  He was a tall big lump of a fellow, a Roumeliote from Adrianople.  Under examination he said that the Turks had been told that England had asked for peace and that Germany was now arranging the indemnity.  The Turks were all wanting peace - the food was bad, no water, meat or bread - only beans now and again.  He went on "if you break a bone in a finger of every Turk, you will find friendship in it for the English" and he added with reference to the Turkish losses which had been very severe - "In Roumelia there are now twelve women looking for husbands where there only used to be six." 
 15:10:15 -  New Zealand Casualties:   Christchurch, Sept. 15:- The casualties among the New Zealand Forces at the Dardanelles are as follows - 
  Officers  - 78 killed - 201 wounded - 15 missing  Other Ranks  - 1231 killed - 4083 wounded - 530 missing 
 Totals - 1309 killed - 4284 wounded - 545 missing 
 This give the total casualties of all ranks at 6138. 
 16:10:15 - Home letters tell me that Sydney went mad one day in August when the City was informed that the Dardanelles had fallen.  Flags were flown and all were wild with excitement.  Perth, too, seems to have received this huge "canard".  What a huge joke considering our stagnation here. 
 The Turkish festival of Beiram begins between the 18th and the 20th instant, and lasts for four days.  It is quite possible that the Turks may be prevailed upon to make a "fanatical" attack, and all ranks have been warned to be on the alert. 
 Reports from Suvla way say that the Turks in the trenches have been circulated with the news that the Germans will be down to help them in a few weeks.  Ah! me:  any old lie to keep them going.  I think the Turk is about tumbling to the Germans' chicanery as a liar - the deserters we have all proclaim that they don't believe half what the Germans tell them.  And no wonder. 
 We held a "demonstration" this morning along the whole line from Lone Pine to Chocolate Hill.  Its object was to draw the enemy's fire, gain knowledge of his strength and any of his new positions.  It was an utter failure - it was too mild and spasmodic, and the wily Turk kept as quiet as a mouse. 
 17:10:15 - We are now settled down comfortably in winter quarters and
