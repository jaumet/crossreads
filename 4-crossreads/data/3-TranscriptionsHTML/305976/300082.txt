<p>Monday Nov 11<br/>Today about 5pm the news came through that Germany had thrown in the Towel. Needless to say there was wild excitement.The Batterys were firing, Torches &amp; Flares made the skie seem like day. The horses stampeded in our lines and it was some job to catch them. Everybody was happy for after 4 yrs of war Germany has at last been brought to her knees.<br/>Tuesday Nov 12<br/>2ND Brigade sports today. There is very little to do now except enjoy yourself as well as possible under the conditions.</p>
