<p>July 14th<br/>Arrived at Freemantle about 7 o'clock in the evening.  Were only staying about three hours. Troops who were coming on board here had already begun to assemble, and there was fine crowd in the wharf.  No leave was granted at first here, but finally we were give an hour and a half ashore.  Found this place to bear a great deal of resemblance to Sydney, with its narrow, crooked streets, but being night time, and leave being so short did not have time to see anything much.  A crowd of our boys made a rapid acquaintance with "Swan" beer here.</p>
<p>Goodbye Australia<br/>The bold outline is growing dimmer<br/>In the Sunsets Golden glimmer<br/>Jutting headland, rocky slope &amp; winding bay<br/>And the troops all gathered forward, with<br/>Strained eyes gazing shoreward<br/>Just to catch the last glimpse fading with the day<br/>And a passionate devotion, strong and boundless as the ocean<br/>For a Home of Homelands glorious and free.<br/>With a solemn, strange insistance, as we swing out in the distance<br/>Thrills our hearts anew with Sacred love to Thee</p>
<p>All the tender ties that bind us, all the memories that remind us<br/>Of thy shores thy sunkissed lands, thy beauty rare<br/>Every Golden recollection, strong chords of deep affection<br/>Builds anew the hearts high Throne, and sets Thee there.</p>
