Hurman & Ralph, Mr &Mrs Hart - their twinnies & my little sweetheart Graham. Then Newnie & Ruth, May & her Joybell. How I enjoyed that wholesome yet dainty lunch. Twas the first nourishment I had had since the stewed mushrooms at Mrs Robjohns at Mt. Lofty on Wednesday. A friend of my brother-in-law motored us down to the boat (some went by train). He took us through the King's Park where we had lovely views of the beautiful Swan, but again it was all too short. So soon good bye to them all was to come &  that meant goodbye too to dear old  Australia, but the W.A.s gave us a send off to be remembered. There were crowds & crowds on the wharf & the ribbons of all colours flying thick. It looked very pretty indeed. When I left Perth I couldn't decide which city I really preferred out of Sydney, Adelaide & Perth. They have so many distinct charms of their own.When we were out some distance we found we had a little stow-a-wayon board, a little chappie named Reggie - age 12 years from Mt Lawley. He has become quite a pet & our Red Cross boys
