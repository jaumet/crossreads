 line is only about 15 yards from that of the Germans and so you have to speak in a whisper.  I saw one curious thing which was that one of our periscopes had been put exactly opposite to one in Fritz trench, and as I looked in on several occasions I could see the Germans looking at me, so that we had a good look at each other. During the morning he threw over some cigarettes and the boys in return showed him a tin of bully beef by placing it in front of the periscope the image being duly reflected in his, and he nodded, so over went two tins.  He then placed his rifle in front of the periscope and made the action of throwing it away from him, whereupon our boys nodded vigorously knowing that he meant fighting was not in his line.

It consisted of a sheet of galvanised iron forming a part of the wall, with a square cut out near the bottom for the fire place. Against the out side another sheet of iron was bent in a semi-circle and placed against the flat surface of the other sheet, thus forming the fireplace where the square was cut away the rest being the flue. An old grate installed and we had the "dinkum oil"  Had a swim. Tuesday 26th &ndash; Went with Mahan to the trenches to-day and had a
