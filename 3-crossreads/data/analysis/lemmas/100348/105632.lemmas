 They convey the whole divis about 35 mile . My Battalion was taken to a certain point from whenc we march through much mud ; to a camp near Fricourt . Rain heavili . The French motor driver seem to live on bread and choclat ; and are dress in huge hairi goat skin coat . 24/10/16 March on through the rain ; along road conjest with traffic . Dump our pack along the road and don light fight order . Halt on a place we call " Mud Hill " ; though the whole landscap is a sea of mud ; of the consist of cream . Absolut no shelter here , but I have found a possi in an old trench . Am drench to the skin and cover with mud . Do n't enjoy the prospect of fight in this weather .
