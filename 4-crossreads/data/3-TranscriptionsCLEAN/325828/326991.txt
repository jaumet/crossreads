My dearest Father,Another Sunday has come round, a wet, cold, & miserable day.   I am sitting by the fire, writing, for we have been having very wintry weather here.  Yesterday morning when I opened   &   my eyes & looked out I was astonished to find it was snowing.  It continued till about mid-day- not very heavy certainly, but still enough to say it was snow.I haven't been about very much since I've been over it has been so beastly cold.  After breakfast I settle in front of the fire with a book & often don't stir till lunch- timeI went down to Essex last week & looked up Percy Limn's people.  I met his Mother who is a very nice woman, & I stayed to lunch with her.  Perce himself is in one of the hospitals & is very bad with rheumatism, contracted whilst in Flanders.I have in my possession now, a piece of aluminium, which was once part of the framework of the first Zeppelin brought down on English soil.
