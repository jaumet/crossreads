<p>Dear Mother Just a line to let you know that I am still doing well. My toe is a trifle sore yet and will be some weeks before it is well. I was operated on last Friday I had the nail taken right out so it will be some time before I will grow another nail.<br/>It is getting very cold over here now. It is not to bad over in this hospital it is under canvas it is the biggest hospital in the world under canvas.<br/>I might get a trip further out of it to Egypt or possibly to England Well I must close with love to all at home<br/>Your loving Son<br/>W Reece xxxxx</p>
<p>Give love to "Daisy Maud"</p>
