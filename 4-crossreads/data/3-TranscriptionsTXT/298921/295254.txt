October, 1915Sunday 10Church today - Service by a Yankee Evangelist who ranted away in a nasal voice which frightened the doves & gazelles in the garden to the furthest corner.Sunday is not observed by the Egyptians & I walked to a local mill in the village, where the natives bring their corn to be ground, also millet & a little wheat carried in Baskets on a donkey, a portion is given to the Miller for grinding, all so primitive, yet alongside on a Macadamised load Motors were passing to & from the Hospital.Did 2 miles longest walk to date.
