 [Sunday 19 November 1916] 
 Attended Service by a Canadian Padre, lovely warm morning seems a shame to torpedoe a boat like this but we are now in the danger zone  from the Adriatic crowd.   Some rumours that Officers for   Egypt   may tranship at   Malta  , so as not to go all the way around by   Salonika,    but when a soldier "Wait &amp; see" -  Just discovered an officer I was yarning with was a mate of Percy Redforths in British East Africa, &amp; German East Africa recently conquered should be a good place for young men "after the war!!"  Rumours in England were that our Division may go to Mesopotamia.  Dropped anchor in  (St Pauls)  the Bay  outside  (Valette)  just near the monument to memory of former St Paul
