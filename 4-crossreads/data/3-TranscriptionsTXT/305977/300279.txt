October 1915artillery duels.  Wrote a letter to mother to catch the "Omrah" at Port Said.  It rained nearly all night, but our oil sheets turned most of it off.
Friday 22ndTo day was very cold.  It is hard to know what to do to keep warm.  We have had 5 men go away sick this week from our squadron.  Got more rain this afternoon.
Saturday 23rdFairly fine again.  Had the sun out for a few hours.  2 men who have been away sick came back Martin & Charlesworth.  We got an issue of comforts bought from regimental funds.  Arundale was shot in the leg while emptying a bag of earth behind the trenches.
Sunday 24thWe all got a drink of tea at stand-to this morning.  It was very acceptable  From 5 to 6 is a fairly long time to stand to without any refreshment.  We had some rain this morning, it was very cold.  Our machine gun got onto a few Turks this morning & knocked a few.
