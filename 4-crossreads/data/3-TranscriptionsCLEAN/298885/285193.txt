  
 a message was left for me saying Stan is coming tomorrow afternoon 
 Feb 10th - 18 Whilst reclining peacefully on my floorified bed just after my mid-day "tuck-in" I was informed my presence was required without the portals of our shanty and knowing who it was Im up "toute-suite" (very quick) and soon was shaking Stan's paw. 
 Well we yarned for a while and then proceeded down to find Rube and needless to say it did not take us long 
 I can tell Rube wore a gigantic look of surprise
