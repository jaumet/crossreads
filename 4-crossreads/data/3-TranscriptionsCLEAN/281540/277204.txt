Censoring letters  one gentleman describes last nights operations "An entertainment was held last night starting with an Overture in the shape of rockets commencing at 7.55 pm.  The first item was a solo by an Eighteen pounder followed by a Duet from a 6 inch Howitzer and a Four Pounder which was loudly applauded.  The Applause sounding very much like Rifle fire.  The third item was an Irish jig by a 12 inch Naval Gun which drew unstinted applause.  The Next Item was by the whole Company with the throwing of Bouquets in the shape of Bombs and Artillery shells.  The performance was very lengthy and some members of the audience were much cut up about it and called for their stretchers before the Grand Finale.
