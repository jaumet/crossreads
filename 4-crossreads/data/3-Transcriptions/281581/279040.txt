<p>12th Feby /18</p>
<p>The busiest day I have had so far, and by far the most unique performances.       The events opened with a Battalion in attack. A Reenactment of the battle of Rafa,  and on the very grounds. The Battalion, mounted on Camels, came into action at a fast trot. In the cover of some big hills they halted and dismounted. The men rapidly formed up and so the attack opened. Small parties worked round the cover of the hills, taking advantage of every rise and screen, until a point of vantage was reached immediately under the supposed enemy position. Here the men, under the cover of a small declivity formed up, and at the signal rushed the position at the Bayonet point.  The whole affair was most realistically done, and I quite found myself the nucleus  of  fearsome bayonet</p>
