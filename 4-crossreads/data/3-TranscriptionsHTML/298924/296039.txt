<p>Wednesday 26 February 1919<br/>Rafa<br/>Khamsin still blowing &ndash; letter from Mother Jany. 19th, note Melbourne address &amp; all news.  Cannot be home till end of April now.<br/>Busy writing the History of the Regiment, if I had my own Diary it would have been a great help.  Tonight a Variety Show was given by Concert Party in Y.M.C.A., no accommodation alotted for Officers &amp; when a few from Hd. Qrs. tried to see they were "counted out".  Shows again the Bolshie spirit.  One dare not leave a shirt out to dry but it is stolen.</p>
