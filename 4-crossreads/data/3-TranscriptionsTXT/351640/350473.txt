18-12-14 Do not neglect to keep together the various journals that come for me.  Open each and put it in correct sequence.  The accounts will come for the subscriptions and it will be necessary to send cheques or orders in payment.  The account for The Lancet comes from Thin of Edinburgh, the bank will give you a draft, the "first" of which you attach to the account and send to Edinburg.  The payment for the British Medical Journal & the Medical Gazette of Australia are included in the subscription to the British Medical Association at 34 Elizabeth Street;  the Journal of British Surgery, and, Surgery Gynaecology and Obstetrics are sent by Angus & Robertson.  Sanders of Melbourne may send an account, this is not owing because the journal the sets of Murphys clinics have never not come to me.  Let me know in your letters how you are managing financially?
We expect to be a Cocos islands on Sunday morning, the Captain has promised that, if the day be fine, we shall see the Emden as she is piled upon the rocks one one of the group.
Professor Watson, of Adelaide, sits opposite me while I write 9-20 a.m.  Whether he is pensive or sleepy is not clear to me.  He is an odd old man, not fit to undertake this journey, yet as he is here we must help him through to the best of our ability.  Wonder how the war goes?
[Professor Archibald Watson, 65, surgeon and professor of anatomy at the University of Adelaide, South Australia, embarked from Melbourne on HMAT A55 Kyarra on 5 December 1914 as a Major with the 1st Australian Stationary Hospital. He served with the hospital as consulting surgeon and pathologist and returned to Australia in early 1916.]
