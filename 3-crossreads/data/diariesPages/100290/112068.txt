Had a good easy night, Bob self slept in a dugout we discovered appreciated the opportunity. Lieut. Col. of 3rd Batt. Brought down from trenches at breakfast time with bullet wound in cheek base of skull. Unconscious. Scurry to get him away. The officious Lieut Capt Wilcox. "Take your hands out of your pockets spring to attention when you speak to me." "I am a Capt" ? Collapse of Lieut.
Relieved at 10.30 a.m by 3rd Field Bearers. A long heavy tramp back to 2nd F. Stat. find on arrival no accom. in sea of mud. Bob Ridgway self set to work after dinner to build dugout out of sandbags pieces of tin. Make one quite respectable light fire dry our socks enjoy decent sleep. Fritz sends over some nasty close shells. ?Tis a marvel that he misses with such a wide field.
