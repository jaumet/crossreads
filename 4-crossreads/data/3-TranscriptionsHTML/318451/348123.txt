<p>Sunday 27<br/>Today at 9.30 I went to Nieppe &amp; conducted service in the Y.M.C.A. for some of our men.  At 11, I rode out to the Transport for service, then on to Division at Steenwerk.  At 6 I had service with the Engineers &amp; 6.30 assisted with a service in the Y.M.C.A., Nieppe.</p>
<p>Monday<br/>Was out in Plugstreet wood &amp; saw the men, had lunch there.<br/>On Tuesday evening I got word to leave Steenwerk by the 7.30 train tomorrow, Wed.  I had arranged to go to England for 10 days leave so I got busy &amp; fixed up all my gear &amp; left Steenwerk on Wednesday morning for the 1st Brigade.</p>
