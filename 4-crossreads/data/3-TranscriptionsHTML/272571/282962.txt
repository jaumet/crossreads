<p>our direction, by the wind, and I expected every minute to get a knock on the head by one of them, the darkness, between the sudden and short intervals of light caused by the lightning, was so intense.</p>
<p>Oct 10th Sunday.<br/>Church parade early this morning. The ringing of church bells in the little Greek villages was very pleasant. The morning was bright and beautiful and the island semed so very peaceful.</p>
<p>Oct 11th Mon.<br/>Left the camp at 8 o'clock this morning, to embark for Anzac. Embarked on the "Sir Joseph Pearse" on to the El Kahira and ultimately landed at Anzac early on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Oct 12th Tue.<br/>Sleeping for a few hours in Shrapnel Gully. We are attached to the 5th Field Amb. who are stationed in Rest Gully. D, B and myself spent our time making a dug-out. A couple of aeroplanes overhead. Met quite a number of chaps in this Amb. whom I had met in Cairo before coming over here.</p>
<p>Oct 13th Wed.<br/>Completed our dug-out to hold three. Very comfortable. Shells are bursting on the top of the hill opposite us, about a hundred yards away. The experienced men seem to pay little heed to these shells bursting near them.</p>
<p>Oct 14th<br/>Rifle firing is kept up continuously during the night time and during the day it is more or less continuous but not so heavy.</p>
