<p>March 22, 23<br/>236.<br/>Roy just brings mail in &ndash; a book from T.B.C., Padraic Pearse by the format.</p>
<p>I intended to enter it yesterday, Harry J. was responsible, seeing Lofty reading Oxenham's book of verse &ndash;</p>
<p>"John Oxenham! oh it was Harry Oxenham I used to [indecipherable] with!"</p>
<p>237.<br/>A reading finished of "Dauber", read by a split wood fire in a great open grate, and sitting on a deep cane salvaged chair &ndash; like the old one in my old room, comfort even to the cat purring on my lap.</p>
<p>Canto VI<br/>Dauber the most thrilling narrative poem I've read, must pass it to Les F.</p>
<p>A splendid spring day:  but we stayed inside!</p>
<p>March 23<br/>238.<br/>A mail up, Australian to date of Jan. 23, none for self.</p>
<p>Last night's shelling caught Y.M. building and wrecked one side, also blew in windows of old Medical Hut.  Other shells seemed red, but no casualties.</p>
<p>March 23<br/>239.<br/>Early evening of a splendid summer day.  This afternoon we lay in the Ambulance, full in the hot sun, yarning of surfing and days of sun.  Vertical breeze &ndash; so to dugout.  Out again, Les finishing Dauber, self reading Pearse's Rebel songs.</p>
<p>240.<br/>The rumour comes of the Germans being in Veaux, an advance by them on a twenty mile front &ndash; Bullecourt, Lagnicourt and Noreiul falling.  Wireless sets free the rumour of Veaux falling at 11.15 this morning.  Part of Passchendaele reported lost, Bailleul out of bounds to all but Despatch Riders, they using its roads at a big risk.  Rumour earlier whispered of the tower of Bailleul's Hotel de Ville being knocked.  Our reserve Division moving for Somme front.</p>
<p>Y.M. evacuated this morning, only an Artillery encampment, Traffick and ourselves left.</p>
<p>241.<br/>Entering in bed, when the Ambulance left, we salvaged half a dozen R.C. set of pyjamas, bonser soft fine flannel ones:  mine fawn patchy blue striped, their softness on the body a most exquisite sensation,</p>
