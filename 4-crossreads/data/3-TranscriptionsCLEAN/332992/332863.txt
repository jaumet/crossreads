  
 authority that the British obtained a big victory over the Turks, capturing 900 prisoners and the G.O.C. of troops in Mesopotamia.  This is exceedingly good news if true. 
 Saturday March 31.1917 Dull & cloudy with occasional showers.  There is a cold wind from the west.  This is the last day of March.  Three months of the New Year gone.  This time last year we all thought the war would be over before this.  However we are very near the finish, and every day we are gaining more successes.  In another two months, we will in all probability see the end of it, or thereabouts, & possibly before. There must be a great congestion of traffic on the railways, for no papers have come to hand either yesterday or to day.  It is very annoying seeing that the news is so important and interesting. Last night and today I had some very pleasant games of Euchre. Captain Mahon told the orderlie that Pte. Saunderson who was in bed 29 alongside mine & was sent away to a clearing station over a week ago, had been eating some rotten food in Steinwerck and now has typhoid fever.  It is to be hoped an appenedemic of Typhoid will not break out.
