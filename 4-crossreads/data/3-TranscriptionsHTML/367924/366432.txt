<p>Still on the Move<br/>Nov 16th 1917</p>
<p>Dear Aunt<br/>Just a few lines to let you know that I am quite well &amp; hope you are all the same. Well I have only a few minutes in which to write this note.</p>
<p>Well of course you have seen by the papers what is doing here &amp; we are still on the move. I will be able to write a rather interesting letter or two when we do stop for a while some where. I suppose you will have seen Levi before you recieve this note.</p>
<p>The last letters I recieved from you was dated 31st Aug, we have recieved no mail since the 7th of Oct. And that parcel that Rodgers sent has not turned up yet or the one that Nell sent either, but I hope to get them when we do get to some camp again, we are hardly ever camped in the same place two nights together, we have done some long rides lately.</p>
<p>Well I must close with wishing you all A Merry Xmas &amp; A Happy New Year. Remember me to Birt &amp; his Wife</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours ever Loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
