  
 up some more prisoners in wagons, but had to wait a long time for some material & eventually we left for the junction at Conchil where the train was to proceed past Abbeville. After waiting for a French chef, they decided to put a French engine on in place of our R.O.D. engine & sent her back to the depot, & as the guards required to work the chain, I went along with them riding in the leading brake van. 
 We left Conchil at 4 pm & after a good run through Rue Noyelles, we arrived at Abbeville at 5.15 pm. I went along & caught it, riding on the engine & at 7.15 arrived back at Conchil & the two guards & myself walked back to the camp, taking 1/2 an hour to cover the distance of about 2 miles. After a good hot meal & a smoke I turned in for the night.
