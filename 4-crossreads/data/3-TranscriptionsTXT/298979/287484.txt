On the fourth day he again "biked" it to the front & on his return about 9 Oclock in the evening, he eagerly burst in upon the men, those then in the billet & explained he had important news to convey. As the troops at present holding the line were doing almost nothing we were all to turn out at 6 am next day, all ready to march to the firing line. All men absent had to be personally notified & he wanted every one, properly accoutred, to be "on time". Excitement became very intense, messengers were sent to the village to hunt up all the "stragglers" so that every man would have a decent nights rest, as we would have two or three days hard marching to reach the line.
Our work there was to "stir things up a bit" Keeping the Huns under a constant fire & give them as little peace as possible.
Everyone that night was highly elated at the prospect of being so soon brought into touch with the enemy, and also thus avoiding the two months proposed strenuous drilling which would have been considered irksome after the good time we were then enjoying.
Up till that time, this order to parade for the journey to the firing line, at 6 am, was the only order ever issued, that was not altered in any way.
At five minutes past 6 our Company marched out of the grounds, of our billets, and joined the battalion for the move forward. A hard days marching brought us eventually to the town of Estaires here we stayed for a day & a half under conditions similar to that of the previous billet, and another days marching brought us so close that we expected to enter line at any moment.
On every side was evidence that we were in close proximity to "War". "Tommy" soldiers seemed to be everywhere, in billets in Camps, on the road, & in the fields around.
Batteries of very heavy guns, some on the move, others being set up others of the very heaviest calibre already set up
