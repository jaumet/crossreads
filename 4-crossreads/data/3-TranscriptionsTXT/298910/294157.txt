"Australians"
Written by Miss Ethel Campbell (of Durban) after hearing a wealthy Durban Merchant speak disparagingly of Ausies.
We are not cotton spinners all, but some love England & her honor yet
We stand on the shores of DurbanAnd watch the transports goTo England from AustraliaHurrying to & fro,Bearing the men of a NationWho are heroes to the core -To stand or fall by the Motherland,And they are sending thousands more.We've watched the ships returningWith the cripple & the maimWith limbs that trail & falter
