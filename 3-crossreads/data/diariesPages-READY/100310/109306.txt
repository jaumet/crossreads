12/9/17 Campagne ? Steenvoorde 
And there issued each man with a good hot dixie of tea which they had with some army biscuit. At 8 am we passed the Bde. starting point being the leading battalion of the whole of the whole Division. Marching on the 1/100000 map we wound through villages countryside among pleasant green hedgerows and smiling fields. Noticed many hop fields where picking of the blossoming plants was in progress. The marches were of 50 minutes with 10 minute spells and the band did good work on the move. For lunch we pulled up on a field near Steenvoorde had 11/2 hour there. The tower of the Steenvoorde church is a modern open one and can be seen for miles. The people speak Flemish here and it sound s very coarse and guttural after French. Steenvoorde is one of the usual cobble stoned places and has an ordinary big market square. We picked up our billet guides and marched into close billets on fairly open country
