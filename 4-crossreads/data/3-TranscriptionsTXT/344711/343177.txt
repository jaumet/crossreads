 engraved on the walls, which reads, interpreted, "Praise be to God, the Lord of all creatures, the merciful and the compassionate.  Direct us to the right way, the way of those that ask to be gracious, not those to whom Thou art incensed, nor of those who go astray."  At least that is the version given us by a stoney-looking Egyptian of the better class, who constituted himself our guide.  There are 365 chains hanging round the walls, said to hold a lamp for every day in the year.  There is also a Wishing Pulpit, where you go through holding each others hands, and wishing with all your might, and your wish is supposed to come true.  Afterwards we went over to a new mosque, where we saw a lot of tombs of old Egyptian Royalty, each one of marble, mounted with silver, ivory, ebony, etc.  There are also a lot of silver candle sticks, each four feet high, worth &pound;1000.  It is said that the total value of silver in the mosque is &pound;52000. 
 On our way back I went into a large Catholic Church, and was much impressed by the beauty of the architecture inside and the different pictures and altars.
