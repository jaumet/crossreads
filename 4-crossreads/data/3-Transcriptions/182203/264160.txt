<p>[Letterhead of Sister L. Hill.   Glenhope Private Hospital, 8 Brunswick St., Fitzroy.]<br/>I have much pleasure in stating that I have known Nurse E. Thistlethwaite as a nurse for 7 or 8 years. She was on my Staff at Milton House for two years, as Theatre Nurse, Staff Nurse &amp; then acted for me during my annual holiday.<br/>She has also been on my Staff at this Hospital.<br/>She has had considerable experience in Surgical Nursing, as well as Medical Nursing.<br/>She has shown herself to be a reliable &amp; skilful nurse, beloved by her patients &amp; also by her fellow nurses.<br/>She is a steady, sensible woman, who would do credit to any position she is asked to occupy. I regretted very much losing her.<br/>Sister L. Hill, Matron A.A.N.S.</p>
