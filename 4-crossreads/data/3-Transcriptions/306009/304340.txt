<p>1915<br/>June 3 Thu.<br/>A native killed another with an iron bar this morning just outside Hospital gates. Very interesting to watch the weeping &amp; wailing of the 30 or 40 womenfolk who collected near the body &ndash; (cameras got busy.)<br/>In afternoon went from Bab-el-Louk Station, Cairo to Helouan, 15 miles south on edge of desert. Very interesting journey with Mokattam Hills on left &amp; Nile on right. Helouan a pretty little place &amp; great health resort &ndash; dry healthy air, hot sulphur springs etc. &ndash; Went over Al Hayat Convalescent Military home containing about 700. Saw a Bedouin Marriage Ceremony which was very interesting.<br/>Saw in an Australian Casualty List that Capt. G.L.B. Concanon had been killed at Dardanelles.</p>
