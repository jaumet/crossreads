Stayed in doing odd jobs about the place. Message arrived just as "C" parties were ready saying ceremonial parade would not take place at Divnl Headquarters owing to "embarkation tomorrow". We expect to leave for Egypt any time now. List required by 1130 after about 3/4 hour notice as to all clothing equipment requested and may want. Being unable to supply correctly without kit inspection sent in rough estimate. This to enable Division  to have stock in Egypt. Great talk of a mail but owing to prospective move will probably be withheld. 
 The weather today very chilly and dull. The side of the harbour nearest to us is allotted to the hospital ships indeed the harbour is full of shipping. Kit inspection and pay this afternoon. About 1600 with Major Smith Mackay & Drummond went along beach for about a mile and a half. Aquitania nearly 30000 tons 4 funnels now a hospital ship now coming in through harbour entrance. The country very stony, it is an easy job to build a hall or a road. Saw a peasant ploughing using a pointed stick  two oxen drawing this implement. On some donkeys close by noticed the same type of wooden saddle as used in Imbros. After that found a man wandering about with very few clothes on, as he was drunk had him looked after.
