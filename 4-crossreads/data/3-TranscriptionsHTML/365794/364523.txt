<p>Wednesday 2 [1] May 1917 [1918]<br/>11 a.m. comes C. Murphy &amp; takes yet another swab of my luckless throat &amp; if neg. I may go.<br/>Miss Warrel visits me &amp; talks as usual of her age which worries her evidently.<br/>Choubra holds a reception 1st Wed. in every month &amp; Miss Oram graced the building today.<br/>My kites fly down for chicken bones every lunch hour &amp; my pet sparrows come at 5.15 a.m. for crumbs.<br/>Met the O.C. on the entrance &amp; had a friendly talk, am glad as fear my behaviour thus far has been churlish in the extreme but it is two nervous people meeting.<br/>Met C. Spencer also &amp; redeemed my behaviour too I hope.<br/>F.E.H. is not a success as a pt. &ndash; that I now know.</p>
