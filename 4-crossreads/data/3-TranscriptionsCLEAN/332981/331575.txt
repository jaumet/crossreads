After making ourselves right in the truck we received orders to draw 5 days rations & work a train to Montignee in Belgium signing on 3 pm. After drawing our rations & oil, I being first on duty, I oiled up and was all ready at 4 pm. It was close on 5 when were shunted on to our train & left for our destination. I worked the train to St Omer were a Pilot came aboard to Pilot the engine as far as Fives a R.O.D. Depot near Lille. We made a good run through Hazebruick [Hazebrouck] until Merris was reached were we were blocked for a long time. As my time was up at 1 am, I was relieved at this place & after some supper turned in tired.
