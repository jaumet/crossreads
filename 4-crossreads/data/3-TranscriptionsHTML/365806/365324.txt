<p>8<br/>It is extraordinarily difficult to get information about men who may be within a few miles away.</p>
<p>It is now definitely settled that we leave here on the 22nd and I expect we shall be in our quarters in France about a week afterwards, when we can settle down and make ourselves comfortable for a long stay.</p>
<p>This letter has become too long for a busy man like yourself, but its length is directly proportionate to my gratitude for you.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>E M Brissenden</p>
