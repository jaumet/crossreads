<p>P.S. I suppose you wonder why we didn't go on Monday 12th. There was not room on the transport and all the rest of the hospital have gone except Colonel Dick <strike>the</strike> who has been left to look after us. He such a nice sensible man. I am glad he is still here. His wife a comfortable lady &ndash; with kind heart is here too &ndash; she will miss him terribly &ndash; as none of the doctors wives can go with them. Mrs Fraschi &ndash; is separated</p>
