  
 out-door pursuits have had to be considerably curtailed and I am determined to devote mort time to the study of French so that by the beginning of next summer, I may be fairly proficient. At the same time I am studying the customs & habits of the people themselves and their fair country with its fertility &  resources. Wed. 1st Nov 1916 2 pm.: While at Paris I missed seeing  a Taube that flew over Wimereux & Bolougne on Monday week. The various anti-aircraft batteries in the neighbour-hood opened a great salvo of fire on the machine which however escaped. The Taube dropped no bombs and must have only been a scout.
