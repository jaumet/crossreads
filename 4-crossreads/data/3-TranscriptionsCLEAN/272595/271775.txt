30th.  It has been a lovely & glorious day nothing but sunshine from morning till night, just the opposite to yesterday.Heard tonight that the 1st,   5th & 9th Battn's had been broken up to reinforce the remainder of the Div. what a shame if it is true for those Battalions have a record that all are proud of why it seems as if one is parting with something that is part of his life, I can hardly realize its true myself they must be wanting men very bad to take such a drastic step as this with the old 1st Div. & I for one will not like the idea of going back to a strange unit after being so long with the good old black & green.
