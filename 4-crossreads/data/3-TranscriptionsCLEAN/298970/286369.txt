we are left isolated.  No news of relief.
5th August (Saturday)
Lay awake for hours last night troubled by large mosquitoes, guns and machine guns.  A few more patients this morning.  One man was hit by an explosive bullet.  The infantry here are being relieved today.  My friend and I before settling down at Elbow Farm after changing over were required to take some dressings to an officer at Port de Cleus, between Fort Rompu and Fleurbaix.  We had handed the dressings over and were having our tea in an estaminet close by when two shells came over with an awful crash.  They landed in a farm yard not far behind us and the concussion shook the building we were in.
