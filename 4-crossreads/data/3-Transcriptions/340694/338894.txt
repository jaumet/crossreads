<p>9<br/>I had a pass to go across in the Officer's boat &amp; rather enjoyed the trip. A steamer was seen coming down the Canal with her search-light full on. It was a lovely moonlight night but very warm. Coming back I hopped on one of our wagons this side of Canal (They "break" the bridge even night) &amp; rode back to Supply Depot.</p>
<p>It is lovely of a night to lie on the chaff stacks just in front of our door &amp; yarn. It was a terrific day yesterday but a swim at about 4 o'c went well. To-day is going to be as bad I think, the sooner we get out of this Hell on Earth the better.</p>
