<p>Commonwealth of Australia<br/>Department of Defence<br/>Melbourne<br/>21st August, 1916</p>
<p>My dear Mr Justice Ferguson</p>
<p>I have received your letter, &amp; quite agree with your dislike of the course proposed by your friends.</p>
<p>I do not think the Minister will hear of it except through the Adjutant General, so I think it best it should be known to that officer, &amp; I have sent it to him, as he alone deals with questions of personnel.</p>
<p>Yours very kindly</p>
<p>Hubert Foster</p>
