<p>Monday, July 10th:<br/>Fine.  Rise 5.30 a.m.  Physical drill.  We leave our billet at Merris 6.30 p.m.  Arrive at Godersvelde (distance of march, 6&frac12;  miles) 8.45 p.m.  Once again we bivouac there for the night.

<p>Tuesday, July 11th:<br/>Reveille 3.30 a.m.  Fine.  Pack up and get drink tea, march to station and entrain.  While at Merris I visit the local R.C. Church.  Part of the ceiling was destroyed by rifle fire of some sort, some of the windows have been smashed.  The interior was gracefully designed, with statues of the Virgin Mary and Jesus on the Cross &ndash; in fact a fair number of figures were in evidence.  A great deal of carving was in evidence.  The material was a very good class of oak.  I saw the confessional boxes.  The lovely pulpit with its winding stairway, the Christening Font, and another article that had some red liquid in it;  this receptacle was on a sort of ornamental dish.  The woodwork was certainly the work of experts</p>
