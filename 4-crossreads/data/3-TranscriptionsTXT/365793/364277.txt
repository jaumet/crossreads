Was coming out of the YM & fell head over heels into a nice heap of stones.Recd a letter from Uncle, & one from the NSW Bank re  25 cabled to me. Written a long letter home. This eye socket gives me jip at times, & the glare of the sun & much walking or reading makes me feel dizzy. Packs are at Plymouth so have written for them to be sent on here[in margin] M
