Unable to bear the rapid growth of the tropics they seized their razors & SHAVED. Champagne for us tonight at their expense; they have broken their vows.9.30 We had the champagne - thrice round. Several of the officers from the "Aorangi" came on board and helped in the dispatch thereof.There was quite a merry party also from the warships. "Togo" (the barman) was kept busy. "Togo" stands about 4 ft nothing, with a small black moustache, and a swagger fit for a millionaire. Looking upon the gathering Lt. M___ was heard to remark, "Bleeding for their b___ country, eh?"

He was proceeding along the fo'rsle one night & was challenged by the sentry who brought 18" of steel close up to his breastbone with a gruff "Halt! who goes there?"

"Pass chain, all's well", said the sentry with a salute.I hear from the "Aorangi" people that the "Grantala" (hospital ship) and "Star of England" are expected within the next day or two, after which the whole fleet sails for Port Moresby.Tuesday Sept 1st : When we went to breakfast this morning we found another apostate, SubLt.
