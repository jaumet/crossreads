  
 a French Madamoiselle (or Madame).  I won't promise she'll be fair or even young but she will be a good cook. 
 Or shall I just kidnap one & bring her out without marrying her.  I don't mean to be shocking.  But they are as a rule, most divine cooks. 
 I'm glad you heard from Jock Ellis.  I haven't seen him yet.  Haven't seen the Macnamara boys or Duncan or anyone except old Joe Ruby & I hear that since then he's been to Hospital. 
 I am being yelled for so must flee.  My love to Mac & the dear old boss & Graham & your very precious self.  Please don't be too reckless even if things are dull & slow at times. 
 Yours ever Jim Wilkie
