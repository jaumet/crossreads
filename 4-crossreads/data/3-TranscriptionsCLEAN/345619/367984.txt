[Postcard - photo of "Ruins of old Wardour Castle" and the words "Wardour castle was built in 1392. It was besieged by the Parliamentarians in 1643 and surrendered by Lady Blanche Arundell, daughter of the Earl of Worcester. It was ultimately retaken and destroyed by the spinging (cannot find this word in a dictionary. Perhaps it should be "springing") of a mine, by her son"]
