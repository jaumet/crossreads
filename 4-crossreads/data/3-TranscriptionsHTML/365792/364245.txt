<p>June 14 &amp; visited relations to no end. Tonight we were entertained at Kings until nearly midnight. Seems strange seeing all the old spots where Dad played as a boy. Tinkers green is just behind us.  The Sexton (aged 50) related tales of long past.</p>
<p>15  Dull &amp; cool but no rain. Visited the old town Hall which stands in the centre of the Street &amp; its interesting too; the ducking stool, the stocks, the old Russian Cannon &amp; several other relics paintings &amp; silhouettes. There is also a fairly good library &amp; pipes for heating purposes run round the sides of the room<br/>Leaving for Portishead this afternoon. Later &ndash; Quite a crowd at the Station to see me off. Some swank! What? Just caught the train at Avonmouth after a sharp run. After tea we all went for a walk along the coast past the Nautical School &amp; back It's a lovely walk too</p>
