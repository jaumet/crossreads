 No early morning parade. Got up in time to receive a good rousing from Sgt. Stacey for being late. The only point that was telling was the fact that lateness if general may produce an early morning parade, so I must go warily. 
 Church parade. Text: "I know that my Redeemer liveth". After a short reference to the recent battle, & the fact that once again the Australians had given the world something to admire, & the home folks something to be proud of, he gave a practical proof of the text. One of his most telling points was an every day explanation of the meaning of personality, & how monstrous a thing it would be if each individual personality was finished when the carcase was dead.
