Alf got a tin of biscuits from Scotland they went well too: "stood to" all night as the 7th affair was to come off: it started at 11.15 with a terrific bombardment from our guns on both salients all along between: Fritz sent up double red rockets red "showers" soon his guns were bogging in a treat: it was awful the big howitzer high explosives were terrible: the concussion, smell of the powder, etc the heat of the explosions were beyond discription I observed from 11.30 pm to 12 midnight the scene between the trenches was magnificent: flares were up from everywhere Fritz was landing shrap shell between the trenches to repel the attack he thought was on : The larger shells banged into our trenches the escapes were marvellous: How anyone escapes at all beats me as there were bombs all kind of shells bullets dirt a mix up of everything flying about: 
Wednesday June 7th 
trenches: "Hell" still let loose: It finished about 1.15 am: Mr Lowther stayed in our bay most of the time we picked out gun positions: The bay next to us was blown in Lowther and I pulled the bags away as we thought Higgs was underneath but thank goodness he was not: poor old Fid J Clark were blown about badly but it must have been a merciful though horrible death: I offered up a prayer for strength am sure it was answered: we were all badly rattled by the concussion etc: after it ended we set to to repair next door but our artillery opened up again for five minutes Fritz replied but it soon died down again: This is not war: men are not made to face these big shells. The lord is indeed
