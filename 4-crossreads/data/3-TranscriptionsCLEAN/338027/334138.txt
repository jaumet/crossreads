Sunday, 21 February, 1915B.P. as usual in the a.m after dinner some of the L. Horse tried some of the remounts, and there were some lovely exhibitions of real buck jumping, such as only and Aust. outlaw can give, her rider rode him to a stand still, it opened the eyes of some English officers who were present.  One of the boys asked if they would like a ride and one exclaimed Oh, bai Jove the horse jumps too much, jumps were real square bucks.
On guard at night guarding the front of the camp and collecting the leave passes, needless to say there were none reported back.
Monday, 22 February, 1915Exercised horses in the morning.  Sammy as usual gave me a rough ride, rooting every dozen yards then rearing and backing in on top of horses so that I could get kicked.  Put down a new horse line in the afternoon.  Reports are very satisfactory from the Front. The French have regained a lot of lost ground.  Yesterday we had a French soldier out to see us, he was wounded at Mons by a splinter of a shell.  He is orderly to a visiting French officer to Egypt.  He describes the Germans as rotten fighters and cowards in hand to hand fighting.  He forecasts the war to last another three months.
