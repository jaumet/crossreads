never left off yelling the whole trip, we had to change at E. Croydon again at Brighton but this infernal woman stuck to us like glue, I only lost her when I changed for the last time at Ford, trains over here run anyhow nowadays its pretty rotten travelling, I arrived at Littlehampton towards evening made straight round to Mr Dukes, we then had tea he I Mrs Elliott went for a stroll round the promenade it was a glorious evening the place was crowded, there were hundreds of Yanks taking the air, they all come from the great aerodromes which they are putting up down here, by this time I was beginning to feel pretty rotten, when we got home I was jolly glad, we stopped up fairly late yarning when I eventually climbed into bed I was done to the world.
