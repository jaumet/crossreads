29/11/17 Mt. Kemmell
Today has been a lovely day quite one out of the box. The sun had little warmth but made things look bright and there was no wind. The aircraft were active and a long chain of balloons circled the front. Specialist training was in progress during the morning and after taking all of these out there were not many rank and file left. After lunch Colonel Brazenor came up with the Staff Captain and inspected our transport which thanks to Thewlis looked very well and fit. The horses were well groomed and wood oil made the limbers shine. Football matches were in progress. Brazenor stayed to afternoon tea. About dark a heavy bombardment commenced and rattled our huts. Preparations for issue of our battalion paper are under way. Choosing a name is difficult and some good sketches suggestions have been received. C Coy had a good euchre party tonight.
