<p>Wednesday 22 January 1919<br/>Rafa<br/>We have an officer on the Peninsular attending to Anzac graves, some have been violated by Turks.<br/>Rumoured Gallipoli men are to wear the Mons ribbon so it means another one for me.  The word "Digger" applied to Australian soldiers is NOT correct here &amp; was never heard 12 mos. ago, more common in France I believe.  Letter from Mother &amp; Day Nov. 17.  You will have many from me ere this, a long time coming over 2 months!  You need not fear about "Dolly", she is such a sweet disposition, I am sure will be happy at Bronte.  It all depends when she arrives, but may be with you ere these notes reach you.</p>
