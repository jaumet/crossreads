 18/1/17   "B" Camp Thoneswood &amp; Ribemont Heavy snow had been falling during the night and everywhere there was a waste of white inches deep and a wonderful sight. Black figures of men and horses plodding along through it. Moved off from huts at 11.15 and reached Quarry siding and entrained in a train of familiar French wagons labelled. "Hommes 40 Chevaux (en long) 8)". Busy railway yard here and Billjim much to the fore turning his versatile hand to tuning engines &amp;c &amp;c. A slow journey through snow to Mericourt where we detrained, a dirty unshaven band of warriors and marched to the sound of kettledrums into billets in Ribemont. The old village crowded with troops as usual. The men's billets are fair and mine was the same as before, but Madame has given us the use of a salle-a-manger. Entrance is via a cow shed in which the cows rest for the winter being snugly stalled. Madame prepared coffee and also brought some cakes in for us. Pedler here too. Expedition to big canteen resulted in a swell dinner oysters &amp;c which sat heavy on one and made for a troubled sleep.
