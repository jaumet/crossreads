  
 16th June The bombardment & general upheaval which I mentioned was the outward & obvious noise of our infantry making a local attack.  Rumour has it that they gained their objective. Certainly they have advanced for, formerly even from here (Abasan el Kebir) we could hear the rifle fire at night but now we cannot, or at any rate I have not noticed it. Absolutely nothing has happened lately, one would think that being at war there would be always something happening which would be noteworthy but it is not so. I saw the doctor about my back a few days ago.  It has been troubling me for the last six weeks just like a hunting back but a little lower down.  He says it is lumbago and I have to get it rubbed every day but it doesn't seem to be improving at all.
