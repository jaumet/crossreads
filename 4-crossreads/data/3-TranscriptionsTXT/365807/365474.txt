 Dear Judge, 
 On reaching my digs I find the whole text of the cable was not 'phoned to me. It reads as follows 
 "London    22nd    June Tell Judge Ferguson I saw Keith and he has made a wonderfully good recovery    hardly any disability now appreciable  
 I am sorry you did not get the last 5 words earlier because it throws light on the extent of the recovery. 
 I was greatly interested in that Dr's report of Keith's injuries and in coming home looked up some similar damages &amp; find my brother contributed an article on Aphasia to the "Lancet" in 1902 &amp;
