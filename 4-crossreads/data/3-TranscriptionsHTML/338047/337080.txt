<p>1919<br/>Aug 16<br/>recognition of his work amongst us.</p>
<p>Aug 17<br/>Aug 18<br/>On 17th August we passed Kangaroo Island  about dark &amp; on 18 August  about 3.30 am anchored off the Semaphore.  We moved up to the outer harbour at Port Adelaide about 9 am &amp; pulled in to the wharf.  There was great excitement on shore.  The crowds of relatives were kept back from the main wharf by big barricades 7 or 8 feet high, so as to make it easier for the troops to land.  The boys were all very quiet, partly because a certain proportion were getting off,  &amp; partly, I think, because they felt too full for words.  There was one old wit on the wharf "Sammy Lunn, his name was, as I discovered afterwards who ran up &amp; down the wharf yelling, "I collected &pound;500 (or &pound;5,000) for you boys",  "Oh you beauties" "You beauties" etc etc.  We all thought that he was a bit touched.  It appeared that he was a great war worker in South Australia<br/> [Photograph of wharf at Port Adelaide]</p>
