one voice liar, so one of the boy's composed the following piece of poetry & hung it in a place where everyone could see it,
"To our Company (A) I don't thinkThe shells have scattered our homestead      The guns are blazing awayWe'd mortage our chances in Heaven"      To be in Australia to-dayWe knew that our homestead was settled   So away to the trenches we fledA. Company's awfully frightened"Were the words that a General said." "ChorousIf that chap would only waitTill the boys were under fireThen he'll see that he's mistakenAnd know that he's a liar,For the boys are not afraidAnd we are surprised that heShould throw that insult at AustraliaAnd the boys of Gallopoli"
