Apl 10 were picked up by Red Cross or Transports. Passed a fairly big town called Hazelbrook, & no end of traffic on the road. Motors of all sorts, cavalry, cycle corps', pedestrians, carts sulkies & buggies passed us in one long stream. Guess theres a blister on my heel & the perspiration & all is oozing through my boots  The weather is fine & cool; Heavy artillery bombardment towards which we are apparently getting closer & closer. Passed by General Walker & another head.  Arrived Uttersteene at 1 pm which means a 6 hour march, full pack up with only 40 minutes spell. We were expected at 4 pm & I believe there's going to be an inquiry into the matter. Did from 15 to 17 miles, & there were some blistered feet (mine were sore at any rate)  Many of the boys dropped out, & not a few visited the wine shops. Our possie is as usual, a barn & not a patch on the
