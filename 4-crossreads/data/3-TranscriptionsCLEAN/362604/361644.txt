 Dear Dad, 
 I will answer all your questions in letters 11/2/18 & 17/2/18 & 3/2/18.  Ellis & Dick, my other mate, have gone to the Theatre.  I have been cleaning up my Room generally & now I'll sit down to write until the other two come Home.  I had two Teeth filled to-day.  I go up to the Dentist regularly.  It saves a lot of pain & saves the teeth
