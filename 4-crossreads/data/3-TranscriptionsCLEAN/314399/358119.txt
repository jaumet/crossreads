  
 Friday 2 May 1919 Wrote letters & then Bill & I went out to the hospital & helped the staff to entertain the Red Cross people. Had rather a good time. Had quite a lot of dances too. Got home at 1 am. 
 Saturday 3 May 1919 Tried to fix up about the school but found that I'd left some papers home. Will find it on Monday. Saw the march thro by the Dominion troops. Was very good. Went to Hyde Park after. Got home at 2  after wandering all over the place & waiting for tubes. Had decent day all day.
