  
 6.  Lieutenant Arthur Treloar (once of Chatswood S.School), Sergeant Norman Jeehan (lives in Chatswood used to go to school when I did), Corporal Cecil Watt (Chatswood stationmaster's son), Corporal Norman Winn (one of W. I. Winn's boys that we knew in Newcastle), Lance-Corporal Charlie Westbrook (Chatswood S.S.) and Private Powers whose sisters at school used to talk about Anna, he said.     And going home I met a Nurse whom I used to go to school with as a little girl someone called Daisy Wearne.  Now do you believe the millions. I want to tell you a little about Charlie Westbrook for he is such a nice lad & I have seen him quite a lot, and shall have a lot to tell his parents when I get home.     It is almost impossible to get anything but a hurried snatch of conversation at the cafe & Charlie was very anxious for a talk & begged me to go to Groppi's when I had finished my work & have some tea & a talk and I was as pleased as possible for it was, even then, weeks since I had had had a talk with anyone whom I used to know in sunny Australia.  We stayed quite a time & I heard all about the lad's ups & downs and a fearfully hard time he has had too, though he was not grumbling but just telling of things as they had been.  His mother will be very glad & proud of him I am sure for a more manly straightforward Christian boy I don't remember meeting for a long time.  He spoke so nicely of them at home, in such a loving loyal way yet with all the blunt boyishness of the lad of twenty that I could have howled.  I may see him again or not for he has just finished a course at a machine-gun school at Zeitoun & is being moved somewhere else now.     I could tell you lots more about this sunshiny lad but I don't want to bore you though I know you will be glad of the little break it made for me.          I am so much alone & often for days scarcely speak to a soul beyond the morning salute, that it is almost an event to see someone
