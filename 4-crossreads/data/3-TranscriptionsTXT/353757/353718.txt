 Dear Vol 
 Haven't heard from you recently, old man, and suppose you are pretty sick of writing me.  However, I've been much better of late, and have answered all letters you've written me.  Do you know that twice since April, I've made a special effort to get my correspondence up to date, and have stopped in every night for a week on each occasion.  I know that my April effort is well &amp; truly under the sea;  I just hear now that all the letters I wrote in July to catch a boat leaving about a fortnight ago, are also napoo.  I reckon its rotten luck, because I can't really spare time to write about 40 letters per month if the Hun will persist in interfering with the lines of communication.  I hope to have better luck this month, but if not, writing letters will be finished for me.  I think also that Home mails are having a rough passage because I get 'em very irregularly, or not at all.
