groomsman, another officer   &  I went to dinner   &  then to "Topsy Turvy". We enjoyed ourselves but it is not much of a show.
Kelly stayed at the Hostel after we returned from wedding because her cousin was to come to see her, so she had dinner with him   &  had a good yarn.
Next morn (Saturday) he called for Kelly   &  me - took me to the Station in a taxi  &  saw me comfortably seated, then he was to take Kelly to commonwealth Stores to store her boxes.
So I'm here feeling very well  &  happy. Fondest love   &  kisses. Hope Belle's birthday will be a happy one. Trust to see you all before many months. Love to all my friends.
FromYours lovinglyEdith
