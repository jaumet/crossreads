  
 January 4, 5 77. Another fine and sunny day, heavy frost last night again, and bombarding on and off late and early.  Disappointed at non arrival of Flecker's Collected Poems from Beaumonts:  hardly a prompt firm at forwarding but their stock is so facinating:  hope it wasn't Napoo when the order arrived. 
 January 5 78. Innoculation today T.A.B. and tonight one solid ache over the arm, from Toby a double Rhum issue, so at all accounts the first half of the night will pass in sleep. 
 Today Tuppy and Radis down from supports, and read from them a letter of Peter Mac's and of Sol's, both so entirely typical of them both, that I've seen the two of them ever since. 
 [indecipherable] P.C. from Elsie, and promise of a long letter following. 
 January 6 79. A mail in today - and from Mother the news of Jackie Howes and Viv Waters being dead of the war.  Two more to join the men of Brooke's sonnets, and two I've loved.  Requiescat in Pace. 
 January 7 80. Written tonight a letter to Mrs. Howes. 
 No mail in. 
 81. Mail yesterday added to - a Press book library on active service - "The Sunken Garden", W. de la Mare from Beaumonts, Flecker's Poems sold:  damn.  P. Books are, Wild Swans at Coole, Cuala Twelve Poems, Moreland Tides, Beaumonts Sunken Garden, Beaumonts 
 Rain last night and no frost in the air today made the roads wet with mud:  cold tonight, a freezing again hoped for. 
 Reading yarn of Ghorki's. 
 82. A new patient in, the Y.M.C.A. Belgian 'Kiddie':  last night in the dark he ran into a post.  He's a bonzer little chap full of quick smiles and quaintly - yet correctly worded phrases.  This smiling face and quick manner suggest the fair drawings in La Vie Parisienne.
