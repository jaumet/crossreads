<p>August 1915</p>
<p>Wednesday 4</p>
<p>Fairly <u>busy</u> day.</p>
<p>More trouble with Hunter &amp; Flint.</p>
<p>Hunter is a <u>dammed</u> lazy scamp.</p>
<p>Still on good terms with Colonel &amp; hope it keeps up for he can do me some good.</p>
<p>Patients doing very well &amp; if they get no worse I am in for a good time.</p>
<p>Have no time to write letters yet however must shake it up now, for we may call at Fremantle &amp; Rita must have a line from me.</p>
