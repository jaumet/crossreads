<p>[Tuesday 5 September 1916]</p>
<p>Off Channel Islands<br/>Wireless instructions to go to Portland not Southampton<br/>(Cold better) Reason given submarines had missed course- many sweepers &amp; Torpedoe boats are ahead of us-   Left Portland at 3.30 pm with a White Star boat for Southampton so appears we will not now disembark.[indecipherable]<br/>We all expected to land at Portland .</p>
