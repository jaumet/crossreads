Very hot again   104&ordm; on verandah
Round Hill paddock with father in morning & set fire to Ben Ledi scrub as we were coming home I think we got a good fire though it. Chilcott came over in afternoon & stayed to tea Joan & Linda & Self went as far as Weblands with him as he was going home. It was great riding in the moonlight after the heat of the day. We did not get back till midnight Cant make John Chilcott out at all he says he is breaking his neck to go & has no family ties & yet he does not move Linda feeling heat very much but nevertheless I think she is happy & glad she came up with me.
