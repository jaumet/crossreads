<p>15 June, 1916<br/>Hill 70<br/>Every day is red hot lately &amp; a chap feels as limp as a well greased girth, but each night is perfect,  the nights of Egypt are with out equal, cool bright &amp; fresh.  On Tuesday ten of us rode out to report to a patrol of Tommies some 7 or 8 miles out &ndash; we boiled our quart pots &amp; had breakfast underneath  the palms in a hollow.  The trees were loaded with dates, I wished they were ripe.  When we got back about 12 oclock, the rest of the squadron horses were all in the new stable, its a treat to see them in the shade.  Tom has just come back from his leave in port Said he had a good time, was amused at the kids who were prepared to toss whether he should pay 3d or 6d for cleaning his boots   On one side as I write they are saying "Heads are right" "ten wanted in the centre" etc   On the other side its "Three Kings here" "Full hand here" such a place for gambling one never saw</p>
