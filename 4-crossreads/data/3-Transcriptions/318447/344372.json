<p>Feb 9th 17 [should be 1918]<br/>Last night we bought a case of Beer and had what is known as  "a big night" There were five dozen small bottles in the case &amp; seven of us to drink it, despite which it was all finished at about 9 o'clock, but by then noone minded. I had great difficulty in keeping fairly sober but, even then I was considerably more sprung than I intended to be. However I saw everyone into bed &amp; put the fire out &amp; then retired myself.</p>
