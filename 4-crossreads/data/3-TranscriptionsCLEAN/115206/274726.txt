 Battery W.Lines.  near Pont Noyelles Weather stills hold good, with the clear skies and warm days. Had the usual dip with the boys. Rode to Daours with despatches and returning called in to see Jack - he was not  in. Discovered that Sig Coy had packed their kit and partied to Coisy beyond Cardonette. Had a jolly decent concert during the evening, attended by quite a number of fellows. Major gave us the "Geebung Polo Club," The items were very very decent. Keith Meillon visited . Had my wool shorn off.
