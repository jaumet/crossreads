<p>1919<br/>April 8<br/>Froggy that I had seen.  I was sitting immediately behind him &amp; had my heart in my mouth most of the time.  We travelled by a good road through the Bois de Boulogne.  There are two big race tracks there, one I think called Longchamps.  Passed through St Cloud &amp; at last arrived.  We had dinner at the Hotel de France.  One of the party rather enlivened the proceedings by grabbing at the entree dish when it was handed to him by the waiter instead of taking a helping.  After dinner we all fell in properly.  The waiter asked if we would have chocolate. We said "Oui" so it was brought round.  It cost 1f each extra, not being included in the bill of fare.  We then entered the Palace grounds &amp; had our photos taken.  I stood on the wheels of two captured cannon, the wind nearly blowing me over all the time.<br/>(Extract from letter 20. 16/4/19)<br/>Then we went through the rooms which cost a mint of money to decorate.  Most beautiful paintings adorn the ceilings, priceless Gobelin tapestries are hung on the walls &amp;</p>
