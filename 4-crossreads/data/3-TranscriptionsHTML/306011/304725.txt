<p>Mond. 26th March, 1917<br/>On Saturday night a daylight saving Bill came into force &amp; at midnight all clocks &amp; watches throughout France were put forward one hour. Our reveille goes at 5.45 &ndash; pretty rotten getting up so early. The evenings will be much longer now and a considerable saving of coal &amp; lighting should be effected throughout the country as the result of the change.</p>

<p>Wed. 4th April 1917<br/>Sunday was the anniversary of our arrival in France. Twelve months have passed since our Unit arrived at Marseilles and the time has passed wonderfully quickly notwithstanding the severe winter now slowly drawing to a close. To celebrate "the day" a general bust-up was held down in the village &amp; the Sergeants had a bit of a spread and a concert last night.</p>
