I have no time now for the Egyptain & they will always keep their distance from me.The Bedouin & Senussi tribe numbers about 2,500 strong & they are a cruel race of people; they kill all the wounded they come across. So God help a man if he fall into their hands.
We have our saddles packed with coat & blanket ready to move out at a few minutes notice if wanted I was put on horse picquet .We had a little better tea than we have had on the track from the Railhead
