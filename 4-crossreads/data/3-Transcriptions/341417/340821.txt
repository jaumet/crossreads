It was very hard work lying out in the sun, advancing, retiring, with only one water bottle per man a day.<br/>There were usually a few casualties every day. The horses were well managed &amp; only a few got wounded, but it was very hard on them. It was usually about thirty hours without a drink &amp; often a stiff gallop through loose sand sometime in the day. Having to keep them saddled in this heat plays up with their backs.<br/>We looked after them as well as possible but it was not a time to study horse flesh. So long a horse could carry a man &amp; a man could sit in the saddle they stuck to it. By night there were three officers patrols left with three men each to keep in touch &amp; report any movement. It was a case of when they came forward we had to hop just far enough back to watch, &amp; listen, &amp; if they went back to follow &amp; see.<br/>I was the second officer for the Regiment for the job &amp; all passed off well. It was rather thrilling on two occasions when we found their patrols between us &amp; Romani; the moon &amp; thick sandy hillocks with brush on them made the job rather difficult. One officer from the 6th was shot dead one night, &amp; the morning before they were attacked McQuiggan</p>
