  
 August, 1915 Friday 6 We Tranship into row boats from the Destroyer, under shell fire but at night so no damage is done - we then March 1 1/2 miles up a Gully to [indecipherable] & join the Regiment - It is hard work to get the c/s of Groceries along over by  Tips  of good gold can be done but I have it still including the insecticide & Sand soap. All my love to you little mother. Boats here now, I write this from the Knight Templar.
