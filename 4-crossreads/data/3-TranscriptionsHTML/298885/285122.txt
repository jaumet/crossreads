<p>cold is just about the limit. Every thing is frozen hard and stiff</p>
<p>All the same we have derived one good benefit from these heavy frosts which have made all the mud "imshee" (go away) and the ground frozen hard to a depth of 12 inches</p>
<p>It is the coldest winter experienced here for 22 years according to reports. The only amusement we have been able to partake of is a picture show twice a week. This show is run by the Army in the battered and shelled Cinema Hall</p>
