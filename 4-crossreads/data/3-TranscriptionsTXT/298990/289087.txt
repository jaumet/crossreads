 Bayonet Trench Flers 22/11/16  Midnight came and we kept finding men shorter.  Some poor devils were absolutely done and had to be dug out by our chaps.  Others were barefooted having lost their boots and four were gathered up wandering round No Mans Land.  A hell of a mix up. About 1 p.m. we reported "relief complete" and were just moving off when we found a Lewis gun crew not in position &ndash; the men utterly exhausted were lying round in the mud inert and helpless.
