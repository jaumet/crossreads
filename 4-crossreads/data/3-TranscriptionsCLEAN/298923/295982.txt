31 December 1918 TuesdayRumour today that the New Zealand Brigade were on the point of mutiny-   They have decided not to Drill any more & stacked their rifles-All very sad after the great name of ANZAC but the General's Remarks of "Cowards" & "murderers" after the "Surafend" incident with the Bedouins is the main reason-Tonight I am field Officer many drunken men & Officers about- it is the latter set that upsets the men-Have a rotten rash all over my body at times I have suffered with 3 different sorts of SKIN trouble-  Time I got away really-
