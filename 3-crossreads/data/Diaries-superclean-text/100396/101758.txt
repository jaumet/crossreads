Dear Harry 
I have been going to write you for some time but have not done so owing to lack of copy. In my last letter to mother I was mentioned the fact that I was not feeling well. I am thankful to say that I am all right again now have been able to have a bit of a walk about in Cairo. No mistake the are a lot of fine places there, the Citadell a some mosques took me one afternoon from the Citadell which is built upon a hill can be seen the whole of the city a huge city jammed into a comparatively small area. Also looked through some native bazaars they are very interesting, in one street about 4 feet wide are weavers working old machines making , in another place I struck a chap actually working hard

I must stop now. I thing were are on the move for a cert now my word I am glad after what happened yesterday we wont be very popular in Cairo much love from your affectionate brother Alan
