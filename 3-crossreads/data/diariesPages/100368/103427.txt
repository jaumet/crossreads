The Bulac Bridge, a peculiar kind of drawbridge, crosses the River Nile at this part. There is a very great deal of traffic over the bridge, tram cars which go backwards and forwards from Cairo to the Great Pyramids, Motor Cars, cyclists, natives riding their camels & donkeys, and driving their carts, continually crossing all day long.

The continual coming and going of the large feluccas carrying merchandise, fruit, stone, etc give a strange mysteriousness to the scene.
On the other side of the bridge the city of Cairo begins, its flat roofed houses some gaily coloured, others the colour of clay, the numerous domes and minarets of the mosques rising above the houses continue until they gradually reach the Citadel and Mohammed Ali mosque which are built high up on the hill, while behind this mosque rise the Mokattam Hills which have a white lime appearance.
