Tues March 26thNot moved yet though 3rd DIV. has gone & the 4th DIV. are said to be well into the stoush by this.

Sat Apr 6th:-Entrained at 1 a m & passed through Calais, Etaples, Abbeville, Longpre, Hangest (where the 2nd Bde disentrained) & on to the St Roch station at Amiens.Marched on to Rainnville (6 1/2 miles) & billeted.Motor wagons are mostly engaged in carrying wounded through & there are plenty of rumors flying around about the "Aussies" being left in the lurch.
