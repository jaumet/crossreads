<p>35<br/>My Dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>Some time has elapsed since I last sent a line home, but I must plead pressure of work as the excuse, as I have been going hammer &amp; tongs up till a day or so ago.</p>
<p>Since writing I have had your letters in one lot dated from 9th to 28th November, as well as Cable 1 and parcels &ndash; The latter were none the less acceptable reaching me in Egypt instead of Gallipoli as we are quartered at present</p>
