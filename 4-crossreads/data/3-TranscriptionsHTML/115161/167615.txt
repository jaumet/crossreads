<p>round us.&nbsp; Wet through?&nbsp; Oh yes! of course we were, and pretty hungry too I can assure you.</p>
<p>When darkness set in, a fatigue party brought us some tea and eatables, and again at about 3.30a.m. we received our breakfast, but nothing more could be expected until darkness again set in.</p>
<p>The bombardment on the second day was if possible worse than the preceeding twenty-four hours, but as we had in the meantime excavated small nooks in which to crouch, we were able to smile a little.</p>
<p>At night we would stand up and move about to relieve our stiff and cramped bodies.</p>
<p>During the second night in these new trenches, we managed to scoop out a sufficient space to crouch in.&nbsp; We suffer a good deal from cramp, but like ostriches, we feel safer when our heads are under cover.</p>
<p>A couple of the fellows dug a very nice dug-out and enjoyed it&#39;s comfort and comparative safety, until a shell exploded just above them, burying them completely.&nbsp; It took us some time to dig them out.</p>
<p>We were relieved the following night.&nbsp; All the way home it was a case of dodging shells and bullets, which were pretty &quot;solid&quot;.</p>
<p>Taking all things into consideration the two days and nights excitement had resulted in a very few casualties.&nbsp; Many of us were a little bit nervy.</p>
<p>To get back to that big building which had so &quot;put the wind&quot; up us was like going home again.</p>
<p>One day here was much like another, when night came we would be glad to get away from the place, even though it meant greater risk.&nbsp; The uncanny feeling that this untouched building produced, fairly got on my nerves, and I was glad to be away from it at almost any cost.</p>
<p>I had often heard fellows talking of the different &quot;stunts&quot; they had been in, and it made me wish that I had been &quot;over the top&quot; also.&nbsp; I had no idea that in the next few days I should have the experience.</p>
