4 June 1915Friday Bombardment of Achi
Nothing of much import last night but first thing this morning the bombardment of Achi Baba took place 900 guns were in the fun & they cut the place to pieces at 2.30 the news came through that the port had fallen with considerable loss to the enemy, we took 3000 prisoners, drove them on to the Narrows where a force of ours was awaiting them they then retired in the direction of Gaba Tepe where the destroyers gave them a further hurry up & now they are in Dead Man's gulley. I met Jimmy Taylor & Giley when on the road to the beach Giley has been here a couple of days now & he is again QV went on duty at 7.30 & punctually at 7 pm the first Bde opened the ball & a few minutes later the arty let it go, the Turks employed star shells & they had a good effect for our fire bombs are being freely used by both of us, our chaps got in the Turks trench at 11.30 & started to strengthen it right away

Turks give us plenty of work & we got 50 prisoners but had to give up the trench as bombs proved too hot for us our arty got 3 guns of theirs & the canterbury's secured 2 m guns, star shells help to beat us towards the last. Col Brown was shot, when morning broke Hal & I paid a visit to the O Station & had a go at sniping, the trenches were in a hell of a mess & the Turks presented beaut targets for they had practically no cover & we made splendid practice. After lunch we again had a go but they were much more wary & the cover T were in good order again. Hal & I decide to make a fresh home adjacent to the main saf, after tea paid a visit to Giley & gave him all the news & what had happened last night. Gen Godly ordered us to take Razor with fresh troops again but I think its practically [indecipherable] the only way is to attack its rear & then it would take some shifting. Godly passed with his [indecipherable] equipment at 6.30 a typical [indecipherable]
