<p>Intermediate Base<br/>Depot, Egypt.<br/>May 20.16.</p>
<p>Dear Ida,</p>
<p>As often happens in these campaigns our plans were suddenly altered and we were brought on through the Suez canal to Port Said instead of disimbarking at Port Suez. For this I wasn't at all sorry, as I wanted to see the canal, and as we went through the whole of it in daylight I had a good view of the whole surroundings. The canal is somewhere about 90 miles long and as we could only go through it at 4 or 5 miles an hour it took us a good while, you see we couldn't travel in the night, had to anchor about mid way.  The canal is well protected, there will be many many lives given up before an enemy crosses into Egypt that way, I have since seen actual trenches that our lads held against the Turks and ones that they are now holding. At the present time of writing I am at an old historical battle field Tel El Kebir, the heat is a bit troublesome, but otherwise I am feeling tip top. I had no chance to see Port Said, as we entrained at once upon disembarking. Cairo is about a couple of hours runs from here. I will have a look round the first chance I get, will write again soon, Trusting that you are all well,</p>
<p>With Fondest Love,<br/>Your loving Bro.<br/>Gordon.</p>
