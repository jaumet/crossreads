<p>1918<br/>Sun. 24th Feb.<br/>The sea-plane is now on deck &ndash; having emerged from the hold yesterday painted grey, covered with Black Maltese Crosses and carrying the number 841.</p>
<p>A huge ensign flies at "Wolf's" stern and a positively enormous white pennant tipped with a golden ball streams from the main mast.</p>
<p>And the crew appeared for the first time <strike>in hat</strike> wearing "S.M.S. "Wolf"" hatbands.</p>
<p>Kiel, with its pretty surburban villas fronting the Bay and the wind mills capping the hills behind, occupied but little attention &ndash; all our interest was centred on the Fleet.</p>
<p>And it was certainly "some sight".   A huge lane of battle-cruisers, cruisers, and lighter craft stretched down the Bay with the crews all manning the decks and cheering.</p>
