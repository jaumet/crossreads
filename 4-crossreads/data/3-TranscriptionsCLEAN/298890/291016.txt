 29. Monday Fine day. Went to awful Minerva & waited & afterwards poked around looking at places. Crawled home to bed suffering unendurably & the ghastly depression - Oh Lord! 
 30. Tuesday. Fine day Feeling so terrible. Pottered & suffered & tried a little shorthand. Oh to be dead! 
 31.Wednesday. Fine day. Shorthand. Went round to Lady Byles after supper. Nina Boyle came & stayed till 11.30. Ghastly depression. How can I get thru these days.
