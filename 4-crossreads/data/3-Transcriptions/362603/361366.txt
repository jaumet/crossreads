<p>3.  I suppose I will have to use news-paper   &amp;   a pencil in the end.  I do not remember whether I told you that I had a Pyjama Suit, a Towel   &amp;   another flannel shirt given to me by the Red Cross about 3 weeks ago.  I have now 2 khaki shirts, 1 silk   &amp;   4 flannel,   &amp;   one light flannel cricketing shirt.<br/>Well My Dear ones, news is run out   &amp;   am getting tired as it is about 2 a.m.  My Regards to all enquiring Friends   &amp;   Heaps of Love to you, Dad, Mother   &amp;   George.<br/>We are both well   &amp;   getting on quite happily we feel certain that the war is getting on towards the finish.<br/>Now Love to you all<br/>From Harry</p>
