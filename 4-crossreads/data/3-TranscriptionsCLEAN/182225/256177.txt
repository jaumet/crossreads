 1916 Saturday 22 Jan. 
 Got Andy Thibaults Maxwell car out & as we only had one blow out on the way we got home about 8.20 AM and gave everybody a great surprise, as we [had?] not let anyone know we were coming home. Linda rested all morning & I was round Hill paddock. We drove round Camerons & Tickles with Cy in spider in the evening. Rang up Chilcott in evening & he was surprised to here I was home.
