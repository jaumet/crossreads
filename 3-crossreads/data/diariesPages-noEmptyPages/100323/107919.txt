28/6/19 London
of youths half tight dancing. All hotels very busy and pots being passed out along lines of waiting girls and women. Trafalgar Sq. was absolutely packed and fireworks and singing crowds abounded. Reached Leicester Sq. by going along side streets and so to Piccadilly. Here girls were carrying "ticklers" ? long brushes and thrust them into the faces of passersby. Confetti was thrown and and gangs of men and women from all grades of society were dancing freely. The crowd swayed senselessly backwards forwards the air full of the sounds of squeakers and rattles. A raging happy and well ordered rabble. Girls all free and easy and all talking to strangers. This all kept going till after midnight when I turned in.
