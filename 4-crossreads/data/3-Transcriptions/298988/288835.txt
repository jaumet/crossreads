<p>&amp; told to keep the change.  They think that anyone from Australia is practically a millionaire.</p>
<p>However in their endeavours to sell you some thing or other, or to do something for you, they frequently make themselves an awful nuisance &amp; at times you have to take extreme measures to rid yourself of them.  Personally, I frequently gave up all hope of getting rid of them &amp; I used to have about four Egyptian guides &amp; advisers at times.  One day a guide followed me about a mile &amp; all my threats were of no avail, so I rushed up to a native policeman &amp; said "If you don't get rid of this guide here" I'll throw him over that fence," &amp; I waved my arms about a few times.  He just looked at me &amp; guessed I had gone mad, because he didn't understand English, so I went before he arrested me for talking out of my turn or something.  However the guide "salaamed" very humbly &amp; disappeared.  It was also a frequent occurrence to see me in the street with about six Egyptians around me trying to find out where I wanted to go to, eventually I came to the conclusion that it was best to always have a guide that could understand English as the Gurry wallers (Cabdrivers) cannot understand it as a rule.  Sometimes you tell one of them to drive you to a certain place &amp; they say "o yes I know", &amp; when you get there its not where you wanted to go &amp; perhaps miles away.  The trouble is the name you tell them in English</p>
