Thursday 31 July 1919Had a couple of parades & got things straightened. Got our trunks & valises over. Had another parade at 8.45 pm & after a roll call they moved into the station. I went in by car with 5 or 6 officers kits after [indecipherable] wiring my name. The Major came in after me to the station & said I had also to report to another Major. Missed the first train over it anyway. Still the second train will do me. We fall in at 11 pm.
Friday 1 August 1919Left at 1.40 am from Warminster & arrived at Liverpool at 10.30 am.  Stopped at Birmingham & managed to get a cup of tea & some sandwiches. They were goodo too. Slept nearly all the way & am still tired. The train stopped near the boat so didn't have far to go to the boat. Went straight onboard. Have a cabin with Ross Knickey and the Q.M. (Lt Howell's). Had a good lunch. Got our gear into our cabin & then had dinner. Met Gus Edwards & Peter Ross. Got Gus to send a couple of wires for me. Had a letter from Janet & wrote her one. Am officer of the guard tomorrow. We don't pull out till tomorrow sometime.
