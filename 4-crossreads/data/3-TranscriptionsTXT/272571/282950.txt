no light job. We tried our hand at it and after we had laboured away until the sweat fell from our brows, one of the little native youngsters, who were standing around laughing at our exertion asked for "backshish" much to our chagrin. As we walked along this narrow street, in one recess seeing articles made and in another seeing the same kind of articles for sale, this proved an exceedingly enjoyable afternoon. In the shops, with very few exceptions groups of natives were gathered. They looked very picturesque in their native dress of many colours. They seem to be of a very dreamy disposition and I take it they are of a religious nature, many times I have seen them in the attitude of prayer, regardless of the many passers-by. The narrowness of the streets make the place look very busy even although there may only be a few people passing too and fro.
Sept 14th Tues.Looking out of the hospital window I saw a few large Feluccas came sailing up. As they sailed into the banks of the Nile, native sailors climbed the tremendously slim, tall masts to bind up the sails. They looked like monkeys on a wire and were very pretty to see.
