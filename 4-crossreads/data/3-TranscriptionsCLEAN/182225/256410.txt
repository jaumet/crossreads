1916   WEDNESDAY 18   OCTOBER
Fine & fairly warm for this place  Cleaning harness all day for an inspection by the C.O. & he passed it all right. Warren & Self & Roy Alworth & Clive Murray pinched some horses & went for a ride down to Figledean for tea. It was good to get out on your own with a horse again. Got letters (2) from Linda & Mrs Lloyd today. We were paid at night but missed mine by going for the ride. The Battery went on duty at night.
