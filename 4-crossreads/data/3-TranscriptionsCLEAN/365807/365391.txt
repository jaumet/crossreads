On his discharge from here to the base his condition was as follows.
General condition excellent. Normal pulse & temp. Scalp wound healed by first intention. Movements of the R arm & leg normal. All reflexes normal. Slight weakness of R side of face, mouth being more marked than the orbiculisis. Understood what was said to him.    Can  Could read both printed & written matter, but rather slowly.    Can Could speak quite well, but some words not articulated quite correctly. No astereoquosis.   The only peculiar thing was a complete R. sided  [hernianaesthesia?] from the head to the foot. The anaesthesia was only partial ie pinprick was felt but dully. So far as I know this condition is always 'functional.'
As regards prognosis, I think he will continue to improve & should say his aphasia, or what is left of it will almost completely, if not completely disappear in time.
I asked the consulting surgeon of this army Col. Maynard Smith to see him & he agreed with me as regards treatment & prognosis.
