  
 are at from A to Z & are both Scotsman, one who has only been out 3 years.  The white shoes which I brought were too small so Ellis sold them to one of the cooks.  I always go barefooted.  It is easier to wash your feet than clean white shoes.  We are in sight of land again now & will see it all the way to Port.  We passed Mt. Sinai but could not see it.  It was too dark. 
 31st Day Out We have land on both sides now & tomorrow we will be in Port thank goodness.  It was a glorious day again & I had to put my sweater on as well as my tunic to-day to keep warm.  I have just written a short letter to Mrs. Dobson.  I would like you to call on them & tell them any news because there was always an open welcome to any of us there & they have done me many a good turn.  I had some jelly to-night & with the exception of some peaches & pineapples that we have bought from time to time
