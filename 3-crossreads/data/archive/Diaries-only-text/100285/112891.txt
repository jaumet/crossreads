gone splendidly without a hitch, he said he would be very sorry when I would have to throw it up, that wont be very long now for my teeth are nearly finished I am then ready for the O.T.B.
5th. Been a few thunderstorms today I got a drenching in one of them, but got changed before any harm was done. Had another spin at the dentists he put the wind up me properly, got poking with the little fine piece of wire down some of my teeth feeling for the nerves he struck one alright thank heaven he decided to kill it so he put some yellow looking stringy stuff in said that would do for the day, the dentist reckons I will have to have a plate in so that looks as if I will be here for another fortnight.
Some of the lads have just arrived home very excited with the news
