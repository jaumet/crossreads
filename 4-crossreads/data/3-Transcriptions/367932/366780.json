<p>Alex Guthrie is writing &amp; Tony Horden lying down.  Two of the best mates you could ever wish for, &amp;.  We are going away &ndash; call it clearing out, running away, evacuating, it all comes to the same thing, &ndash; but we are not beaten.  We'll meet Abdul again someday, &amp; I hope we have the higher ground then.</p>
<p>Goodnight Mother and Father when you get this, if you ever do, it will be all over, one way or the other</p>
<p>Your loving son Lionel</p>
<p>This short letter came in the same envelope</p>
<p>Cairo 31 Dec.</p>
<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>You might like to see that letter, so Ill post it, reading it now, I can laugh, at it &ndash; but it was no laughing matter then &ndash; but you can see how we felt about clearing out.  I was wild that night.  Well its all over now &ndash; &amp; one way thank goodness not the other</p>
<p>Your loving son<br/>Lionel Bigg</p>
