"gallant advance by Australians." but the people who write it, &amp; delight in reading it, don't know the horror of it all. The thing that was grand to see was the way our chaps bandaged wounded Huns, &amp; carried them back to the dressing station, with just the same care as our own men, &amp; Australians, Yanks &amp; Fritzes lay side by side on stretchers. Some of the Yanks soon went under in their first battle, they only arrived in France a little while ago too. When I got back to our company's trench, I was just about to jump in, when a shell burst right in front of me, I don't know how it missed me. He sent more over all round our not-too-secure trench, &amp; we &amp; the Yanks were huddled up in the bottom like chickens, &amp;  didn't know which way to turn to get away from them. It's an awful feeling, so helpless, under shell fire. It's a fine day, &amp; our 'planes are up in crowds trying to detect the Boche's next move. I was mighty hungry, &amp; had a feed of bread, butter &amp; jam at noon., <strike>which</strike> while Fritz's shells were dropping uncomfortably near. He shelled both front &amp; rear. &amp; there was a slight sniff of gas, which made us sneeze. Old Mitchell</p>
