Sunday 7 April
We are now at Longpre ? not where we were in Oct. 1916 - on Somme River and about five miles or so from Amiens. The country about is looking well and the Cathedral looms out from here, dominating everything about. We marched through the town last night arrived here at 5 a.m. It was a weird march, no lights except an occasional torch flashed on to the tall houses on either side of the road, the waggons rumbling over the cobbles raining occasionally. Fritz is only nine miles from the town I suppose the inhabitants are on pins needles over the issue which centres round the town. This village the towns villages about are full of refugees. Yesterday the Bosche advanced three miles took Bresle heavily attacked the Australian front but was repulsed. He is shelling the towns about here from sounds, presumably Amiens. It is sad to see old couples, with their belongings in handkerchiefs on the road to Abbeville. Beautiful day. No orders yet until 4 p.m.
Monday 8 April
Still at Longpre-les-Amiens. The day is wet miserable, but I managed to go for a dry walk along the bank of the Somme. It is a shame to see the people, old young, coming out from Amiens with their belongings on their backs barrows etc.
Last night fine, the Bosche bombed all round this district yesterday he shelled Amiens. The artillery work last night to-day was heavy the bursts from German shells were distinctly audible. The people about here have very little faith in the English Army from their remarks. The French General Fayolle is now the man as by his strategy he saved the French left, which was jeopardized by the English withdrawal.
Much traffic on all lines of railway.
