<p>Monday 21st</p>
<p>To cap Sundays performance the W.O. put me on guard at night.   He picks the Reinforcements out every time for any noxious duties.   A Sergeant had the strength to say openly that it was a great shame.   We spent the day working round the camp making a stone dividing wall &amp; digging a refuse pit.   While swimming from the wharf Sir Ian came along &amp; remarked he would not mind doing the same.   While writing this I can see a flock of sheep wading from an island to the mainland.   The water reaches above their legs but they cross over night &amp; morning without any urging whatever.   After tea several of us went up to the village &amp; noticed at once the difference owing to the embargo on wine beer etc.   Nothing but a quiet orderly gathering instead of the usual riotous one.</p>
<p>Tuesday 22nd</p>
<p>With several others was drafted over as a fatigue party to No 1 stationary &amp; spent the day raking up stones &amp; cleaning camp.   Half the number cleared off leaving the rest to do all the work.</p>
<p>Wednesday 23rd</p>
<p>Was sent again for fatigue duty but entered a protest as a new party should be sent.   We arranged a different system however</p>
