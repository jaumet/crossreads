 I earnestly hope that should anything happen to me, there will be someone near to do for my mother what I, I am glad to say, was able to do for his mother, who was so uppset over it. However the good news I brought helped to cheer them up wonderfully, and soon his mother had a big batch of lovely home made cakes, which I can only say were like my own mother's make, and which I thoroughly enjoyed. 
 That night
