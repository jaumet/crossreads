 Shifted Camp behind another Squadron for 2 days spell, but we are still in the front line &amp; see scrapping of various sorts each day.  Air duels we do not shine in.   What we would like to know is, RUSSIA'S intentions. The Papers say Starvation Conditions exist here, all I can say re Army rations is they are sufficient. We would like to know the correct &amp; true position of the War, so much is cooked for our own digestion. Thanks for Local Paper &ndash; I get the HAY Grazier at times &amp; am still interested in Saffron, Thistles, Rabbits, Shire Council &amp; even who is Herdsman at CARRATHOOL.
