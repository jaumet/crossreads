<p>think of, Bell says to me, "I'm off   this is getting too warm, he will land the next one on us then it is my turn to throw cold water on his proposal, whats the good of us getting out we are just as safe in here, lets wait a while he might ease down I say, right oh Bell says but I don't like our chance, &amp; so it went on all the night, but we never shifted from our little dugout, which by the by started to leak like "old Harry" from the concussion, &amp; every now &amp; again we would be refreshed by a few drops of dirty water falling in your eye or on your face, &amp; then the chats would get going, &amp; we daren't light a candle &amp; start strafing them for the Huns would see our light &amp; then we would draw the fire properly,  oh yes, we had a nice night.</p>
