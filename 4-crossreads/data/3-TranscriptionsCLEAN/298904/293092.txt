How it makes you sick of workAnd its pity help the Turk.Who bumps you in the next fierce bayonet fight.
The smiling faces meet youAnd hearty laughter greet youWhen all discuss the news of their home townHow it makes a man feel smallIf he's cared for not at allAnd no one cares a rap if he goes down,
So show him you really careAnd when you have time to spareJust drop a line to him who bears the brunt,Its not a great deal to askAnd will ease his heavy task,Theres someone waits your letter at the front
