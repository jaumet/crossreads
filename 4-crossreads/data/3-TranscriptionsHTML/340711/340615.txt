<p>picked for Howitzer Brigade.</p>
<p>Friday, 10.<br/>Am spending &frac12; piastre per day, that on a newspaper. We are on Active Service. No Canteens etc. Only two latrines that can be called such. Simply a desert of heavy sand. Food&mdash;active service. Sergeants' Mess, an old board---a couple of chunks of wood for seats---open air---and at night bitterly cold. Meals any hour Third inoculation---for Typhoid and Para-typhoid---very big dose. Arm very painful. I felt it all over body and had to lay up all day. Received a letter from home dated 28/1/16 and addressed Maribyrnong.</p>
<p>Saturday, 11.<br/>Transferred this morning to B.A.C. 6th. Brigade as Corporal---provisionally (one month) F. Subsection. Rotten W.O. Always growling or whining. Has no direct appeal to men. Watered horses three times per day---also groomed and fed them.</p>
<p>In tent with McCleave, Les White, Len Marshall, Sam Crute. It is fine to be with them.</p>
<p>Sunday, 12.<br/>Church Parade for whole 6th Brigade. Poor sermon the little I could hear of it---so wrote up my diary during service. After review of whole division by General ---.</p>
<p>Monday, 13.<br/>Usual routine---watering and grooming and feeding. M., who retained his three stripes, gave us 70 minutes foot drill before breakfast. The men detest him. He is a school teacher and treats us as kids. He has studied psychology, but his horizon is the text book, and applied psychology is unknown to him.</p>
<p>It is fine to sit round the candle in the tent at night with all the old fellows.</p>
