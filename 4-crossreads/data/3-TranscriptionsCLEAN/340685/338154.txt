  
 This diary begun on the day of my departure for the front from Sydney is being written chiefly for the benefit of my loved ones at home as it will be nearly impossible to tell all in letters and this will be sent home from time to time as opportunity offers and my efforts will be concentrated in keeping it up to date. 21.3.16 Reveille awakened us at 3.15 A.M. and after hastily dressing we had hot coffee and stew and jam for breakfast and at 4 A.M. we fell in in a drizzling rain and prepared to start with our kits for Wooloomooloo dock about 2 miles distant from the camp. All the camp turned out as they were needed at the dock to bring the horses into our boat. To the accompaniment of strains from the band we marched towards the dock many friends and relatives who stayed the night in camp marching with us and being joined on the route by others who were waiting for us to come along outside the gates until soon the marching column spread over the whole street instead of being only 4 abreast such was the crowd. Men and women in various stages of dress lined the route having been awakened by the band and many were the cheers and good wishes given for our future while some threw fruit etc from the windows and one good lady loaded with cigarettes passed down the lines and wasn't satisfied until each man had received a box. The thoughtfulness was much appreciated especially the cheering remarks as there was probably not one man among us who did not feel a little glum at what he was leaving him. The last stage was reached about 400 yds from the wharf where we were halted for a while and beyond which no civilian was allowed to approach. Here the most harrowing scenes took place at the leave takings and I was glad mine had all been done when I was leaving for Sydney and not for the front when things weren't realised so much then. We were taken on to the wharf and each man checked off and given his embarkation ticket to allow no  auth  unauthorised person to go on the boat and after a brief speech by our O.C. Colonel Spain in which he praised us for our good work at the camp and told us the reputation we had to uphold he asked for three cheers for us from the men who weren't going after which we returned cheers for all our favourite officers and the camp and the Engineering Corps and filed on to the boat while the band played patriotic selections and we were shown our future quarters for the voyage after which we were allowed on the deck and watched the poor horses being led on board for about two hours and about 8 o'clock the last on board and the  anch  ropes were quickly cast off simultaneously with the advent of the civilians who were allowed on the wharf just in time to see the boat
