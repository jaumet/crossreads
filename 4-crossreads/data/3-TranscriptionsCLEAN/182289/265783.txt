 Warneton Sector - 30.11.17 Details of the barrage were issued to Section Commanders and guns were laid on their respective lines of fire before retiring for the day. Zero hour for the first raid was placed at 5.5 p.m., therefore the guns were brought to the slits at about 4.30 p.m.  Everything was ready by zero hour.  The guns were to fire on the following scale:- 
 Zero to Zero plus 3 - Rest Plus 3 to plus 10 - fire Plus 10 to plus 13 - Rest Plus 13 to plus 20 - fire Plus 20 to plus 23 - Rest Plus 23 to plus30 - Fire 
 The guns fired at full rate all the time.  The firing went off with most of the stoppages occurring through defective ammunition, two cases being due to the bullet remaining in the barrel.  An average of 17 Belt Boxes per gun were thus fired in the first barrage. Zero for the second raid was fixed for 1 a.m. night of 30th Nov./1st Dec.  All was ready and the same table of fire as in the first raid
