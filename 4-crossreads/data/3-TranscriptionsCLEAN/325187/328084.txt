[Thursday 7 December 1916]
Here I am 8 miles from Al Arish & among the Turks again- Aerial Bombs as of yore & Camel Patrols in touch   Since I left Sinai the railway & Pipeline have pushed on a lot & the main road has been laid down with ordinary 1/2 X 17X 42 Rabbit netting, five lengths wide quite good for marching on foot & for Motor CarsIt is expensive but might be used over Sandhills near Homesteads out West.All ranks seem glad to see me back but the Truck I rode out in was about as rough a train journey as a man could have only sand ballast & always drifting.I wrote J.A.C [indecipherable] on loss of 2 sons
