<p>Dear Mr. Horsfield &ndash;<br/>Could you give a little assistance to Mrs. Balfour to enable her to get a few things she needs. You have assisted her before about November last year. She has since lost her husband &amp; now has one of the government cottages at Daceyville, where she moved last week &ndash;</p>
<p>Yours faithfully<br/>B. Booth &ndash;</p>
