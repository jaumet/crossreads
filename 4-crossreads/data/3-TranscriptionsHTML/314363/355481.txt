<p>17.5.18 Detail Camp.<br/>We are just behind Daurs. To day &amp; yesterday were both hot, this afternoon I enjoyed a swim in the canal, there were a good number there.<br/>Lately I have been helping myself to a Frenchman's library in Fouilloy, which joins to Corbie. This man Buillet by name had some very fine books beautifully bound, have already sent four on different subjects over to England, they are on Botany, Zoology, Geology, &amp; Astronomy. Have now two novels which I intend sending to Sydney.<br/>Have been doing a great deal of French reading lately &amp; am getting on well. It is a great pity to see some of these places, especially the home, where I got these books from, this man must have been a student of natural history, I saw there a fine collection of butterflies, &amp; also a photographer, the attic being fitted out as a dark room. As this village comes under a great deal of shelling, there is a big chance of the house being knocked down &amp; everything ruined.<br/>Have no compunction about taking his books, as he has left them there to be destroyed one way or another.</p>
