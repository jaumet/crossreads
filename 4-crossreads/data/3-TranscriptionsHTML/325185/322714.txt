<p>she was sending me a parcel also the Miss Smithers Well both parcels arrived here alright were delivered to my old comp havint received them yet have heard of them a couple of times. I dare say some of these days they will find the corner I am in I sincerely hope so at all events as Aust Jess had sent some socks &amp; I want them too. Well thing are going as well as one can expect them so far we have had a few killed but we wouldent know we were at war if that didint happen. What has Bert done about the Insurance  I could send you the money across but we are being given leave now eights days in England so want to hold on to the little  I have until my turn comes. If you will fix it up for us send me a withdrawal form from the Saving Bank I will sign &amp; return to you</p>
