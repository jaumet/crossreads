<p>A.I.F. AUSTRALIAN COMFORTS FUNDS<br/>THE SAVOY HOTEL<br/>Cairo. 12th May 1916</p>
<p>Mrs  Vernon<br/>1st Light Horse Comforts Funds Depot.<br/>28 Moore Street. Sydney</p>
<p>Dear Madam<br/>With further reference to our letter dated 27th ult. Addressed the Secretary, 1st L.H.Comforts Depot, we have now to advise that the three cases therein mentioned for the 1st L.H. Reserve were sent to Tel-el-Kebir at the beginning of this current week. In the meantime we had addressed these cases to Major Vernon, and our representative at the camp named informed us that Major Vernon was now attached to the Divisional Artillery. From information obtained through Headquarters, we found that Major Vernon was in Hospital quite close to Cairo. Here we visited him and obtained a written order to distribute all goods addressed to him for general distribution to the 1st Light Horse Reserve.</p>
<p>We therefore telegraphed our depot at Tel-el-Kebir, and hope this time that the men are  enjoying the tobacco so kindly sent by you.</p>
<p>We would like to add that Major Vernon is practically well again , and his only trouble now is to get back as quickly as possible to his unit.</p>
<p>We hope the new arrangements will not interfere</p>
