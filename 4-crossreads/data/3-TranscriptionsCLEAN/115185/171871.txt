  
 10 - on shore here and told Capt Matthews his friend that he went on Archie's ship - I think when he'd just died and many of A's officers were with him. He was shot through the abdomen & died of unstoppable bleeding, probably the aorta. He is buried at Imbros - close here - so he did not go past us. He did not come so far. His Father will be heart broken but I need not make any remarks about his loss to those who knew the boy. I may not write to Mrs Scot Skirving till I see the death in the papers, for it may be some time before she hears. I am stunned. But his life was, full of joy & I don't think any sorrows -
