<p>order rifle &amp; all.  I went under right out of sight &amp; I had some difficulty in rising for I was heavily weighted, &amp; when I came to the surface I found that my rifle was at the bottom so down I had to go after that &amp; scoop it out of the soft mud what a nice weapon it looked the Germans need not have been afraid of me if they had attacked me with a rifle like that, to my surprise the water was not the least bit cold I thought it would have been freezing but I was in a beautiful state green slimy weed's hanging all over me &amp; water running off like a wet rag.  I thought my watch &amp; fountain pen was spoilt but neither of them were hurt though nearly all my papers &amp; letters were spoilt</p>
