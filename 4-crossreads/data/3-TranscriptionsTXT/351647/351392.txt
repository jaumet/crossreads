 Here's another scrap to finish up on. 
 There's a man practising his bugle outside, he needs the practise certainly but I wish he wouldn't.  I wish you could see the aeroplane stunts here, they are perfectly marvellous &amp; thrilling beyond the telling. 
 Are you going to have Jean Morton up staying with you at Tog.  I hope she is there when I am.  Do you think she'll let me kiss her even if I do want to very much.  But she mightn't like the "vacuum cleaner" touch. 
 Au Revoir my dear, love to Grahame &amp; the Boss &amp; your self.  Regards to Mac &amp; the Ellis'. 
 Yours as ever James
