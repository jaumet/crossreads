<p>came off &amp; took Gen. Allanby &amp; staff ashore.</p>
<p>19.3.19<br/>At 6 a.m. the wind having decreased in force we hove up &amp; made for the Inner part of Marseilles &amp; made fast at the transport wharf.  The Troops disembarked at 10 a.m. &amp; the civil passengers remained on board for the night.</p>
<p>20.3.19<br/>At 10 a.m. all the passengers left &amp; we took in 200 civilian 1st &amp; 2nd Saloon passengers mostly French for Egypt.  We could not obtain coal or water at Marseilles so left at 4 p.m. for Port Said &amp; going to call at Malta for water on the way.  We had a good run up town &amp; in the City of Marseilles &amp; met several America officers.  It appears that hundreds of thousands of America troops passed through here during the last few months &amp; from what we could gather from the French the Yankee troops were not very popular with the British &amp; French troops &amp; civilians.</p>
<p>21.3.19<br/>At noon we steamed passed the South of Sardinia Island &amp; shaped a course towards the Channel between the South of Sicily &amp; north of Tunis, Africa, a very dangerous part as this place was surened [?surrounded] with submarines they having laid mines extensively from here towards the Island of Malta.  A passage has been swept but it will take years before the work here alone is finished.  Again in the course of time, gales will cause mines to break adrift &amp; float about causing it very dangerous for shipping.  We have on board several civilians for the British war office civil service office,</p>
