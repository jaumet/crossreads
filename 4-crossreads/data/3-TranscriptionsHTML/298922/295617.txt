<p>Wednesday 14th November 1917</p>
<p>Capt. Brace came round to Berners Hotel &amp; told us Laura was O.K. I went Waterloo &amp; shifted Baggage to P. &amp; O. &amp; then entertained 3 of Dollys friends at the Australian Club, not my pleasure but theirs, am glad to see our men are doing so well in Palestine &amp; feel I should be there. Here the Restaurants &amp; Theatres are always crowded with a pleasure loving well-dressed crowd, even on air-raid nights.</p>
