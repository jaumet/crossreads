  
 Fairly quiet going out and got on job and started filling sandbags.  M.G. very lively from two directions all night.  Saw Roberts going out & M.G. very close just outside battalion.  Had to retire to dugout several times as shelling pretty heavy.  I filled a few bags & spent rest of evening fixing on wire for camouflage & at about 1.30 started to cover up.  Unloaded both pontoons although very hot once & had to volunteer to leave dugout.  Robb had wind up badly while camouflaging & then had to run to trench and Sarre & Linton stayed behind & still warm.  Got down safely to Vieux Berquin Road and more shelling there & had to wait.  Then home more quietly to bed very tired.  10th successful raid of 500 yds. 
 29.6.18 Heavy bombardment early in morning and continued to dinner time.  Also again in even.  Didn't get up till after dinner & cleaned up.  To go out with Sarre at 9.30.  Got party of 15 men from 11th & rest of party went on with Edmonds.  Also Groth out & lost party for awhile  Quiet night & some very close M.G. bullets.  Put in two dugouts and filled in and rest did a little gentle digging.  Left at 12.30 & home quietly.  Fine. 
 30.6.18 Stayed in bed till 12 without dinner & read Pelman & practised it.  Continued in afternoon.  Out at 9 with Appleton and on same job with Sarre on a new one.  Parties late as usual & got 18 men who didn't have any definite orders.  On to job
