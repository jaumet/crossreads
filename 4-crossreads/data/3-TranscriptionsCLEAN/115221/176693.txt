place honoured by our presence was the zoo.  We did not go much on that, all the exhibits were separated by about a half mile walk, the fun was in getting there.  Underground, surface & overhead.  On our return we had tea at the same place where we were presented with theatre tickets for "A Taylor-Made Man".  It was very good with plenty of fun.
The next day we met a Sydney man at lunch - from Artarmon - once Manager of the N.Y. Theatre, George St.  After that we went to the movies where we saw G.P.O. - Martin Place & George St. - that woke it up I can tell you.  After tea we went to a Review but it was not much chop.  The next day we made straight for Coney Is. & put in the rest of the time there.
The next day & night I slept & the following day no leave was granted & the day following that we set sail with our convoy, 14 ships, a cruiser & destroyer.
At present we are going dead slow through a Scotch mist or some such abominable curse with 15 more destroyers, seven mine sweepers & two derrigibles.  We expect to get in to-night - Liverpool - at 10-11 p.m.  Thanking you for your good wishes.
Yrs. sincerelyHarry
