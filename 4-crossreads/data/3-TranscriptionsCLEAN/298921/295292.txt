  
 November, 1915 Monday 29 Last night we had our first Snow storm & everything is white. The trenches as one gropes along in the dark show a white wall on each side & are mud to the knees - The men are bricks & only a few wasters growled - we will have real Holly & snow for Xmas here - Folk at home should knit gloves & Mits now, in lieu of soks I am using a pair of the latter for Mits as I lost my gloves in my old Kit, after the charge. Certainly the hills look pretty!! But it is not the Creel Hotel Kosiosko. Posted you Diary yesterday.
