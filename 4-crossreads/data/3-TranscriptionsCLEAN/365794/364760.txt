  
 Saturday 22 December 1917 1/2 day & went to Cairo & did shopping for Xmas - only tiny gifts as alas very few to give them to here.  Tea at Liptons with S. Lee. Very wet day & cold (which is bad) not improved thereby. C.G. asked if Sister does any dressings & if not what does she do? etc., but "mum" is the word for this child.  Leave things alone say I but his kindness to me is very accectable [acceptable] just now.
