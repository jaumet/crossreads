<p>In the days that are to come</p>
<p>We've left our dear old homeland,<br/>Our parents, sweethearts, all,<br/>We could not stay while every day,<br/>Would see our comrades fall<br/>The glorious ambition,<br/>Which spares not friend or foe<br/>Has dared our might, so now to fight<br/>Australians all, we go</p>
<p>Ch.<br/>So farewell my sunny land<br/>And farewell love to you<br/>On land or sea, it seems to me<br/>I see your eyes of blue.<br/>But though my country claims my heart<br/>And lives maybe of some<br/>There's a happy day not far away<br/>In the days that are to come</p>
<p>There's times when hearts are burdened<br/>And fortune seems unkind<br/>And memorys bring a cruel sting<br/>To every anxious mind<br/>"Tis you who fight the battle<br/>Who watch and wait and pray<br/>And so for you we'll dare &amp; do<br/>Until the happy day.</p>
<p>S Young<br/>4/4/16</p>
