  
 there &  worked all day until 8.30. p.m. My poor feet ache a lot the floors are very hard, all marble    & have to be careful one does not slip. I shall try to get a P.C. of the Palace - it is a magnificent building. Sorry I cannot write any more but will try to write soon & go on from where I have left off. Tell friends I shall try to scribble a few lines to them. Am having a good time when off duty. Mr. C. has gone so suppose I shall have a quieter time. Fondest love & kisses to you all  & hope all are well. Yours lovingly.                                                                                                                                                                                         Edith Tell Eddy I shall write to him next. His letters are delightful.
