<p>him lately, nor do I crave after the meeting, because he is not of the cleanly brigade.   I have always been civil to him but to get in his way has not been my desire at any time.</p>
<p>Abassia is between Cairo and Heliopolis, it is a subburb to the city and is an old place, the chief buildings are the Egyptian military barracks, one section of which is occupied by my hospital.  The buildings are roomy and comfortable, well suited for patients, and any overflow is accommodated in tents.   Yesterday I sent to Australia 369.  To day I have admitted 116.  In a few days I shall send to England a batch and to N. Z. another crowd, but there are many waiting to be sent on to me, the changes are rapid. It may be that I shall not stay here much longer, if so I shall be just as well pleased, three months has been long enough and a look round from Egypt might be advantageous.   However you will know in good time.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>The Earps should find the climate of New Guinea somewhat trying.   I hope to meet Roth and Phipps if they come to Egypt.   It is hardly wise for more doctors to leave Australia, it were better that some should stay at hom[e] to assist the people who remain.</p>
<p>My regards to Mr Travers if you see him.  I received a very chatty letter from Nellie Johnson this afternoon, I shall reply to it as soon as possible.   Yes Mater Phipps is of the best class, like unto your Grandmother Nash.   My regards to her too.   Why should she not take a fancy to a sweet girl like my Tabby?</p>
<p>A letter came to me this afternoon from Muriel Bridge, she mentioned about many girls going to St Vincents to learn the rudiments of nursing, that they may know enough to assist the trained nurses if many soldiers come home to be cared for.  It is not likely that you will have acutely ill men, it will be but the incureable and the chronics that will reach Australia, they will not require special care, tell my Kitty not to bother unless she desires to take to nursing seriously, then she had better to enter an hospital in the ordinary way and go through the full course.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I hope that you kissed my Joseph for me as she slep upon the sofa in front of the fire.  I do not think that any one bothers to censor our letters, it must have been that I was not sufficiently careful when enclosing the sheets to number them correctly.   Glad that you enjoyed the day on Middle Harbour, an outing on the water always makes one sleepy.   Sorry Joseph could not go, better luck next time.   Mrs Parsons was good to take you in the motor.  Poor Schlink, one never knows his luck in this world, fancy thinking that he would do harm except with his tongue.   I saw in a paper about the death of Victor Trumper, he filled a niche in his time and rested upon the pedestal of fame; Sic est vita.  Glad that you have some one reliable at No. 211.</p>
