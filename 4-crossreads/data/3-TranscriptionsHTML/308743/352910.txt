<p>21 January 1915<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Stables at 6.<br/>We heard that the mail had arrived &amp; at early morning parade it was delivered.  I only got one from Mrs [indecipherable] in the shape of a Xmas card.  News came to hand concerning the vacancies for commissions.  Toby found out [definitely?] the news &amp; now we are ok &amp;our applications have gone in &amp; now the Boss is up in arms concerning it two NCO's myself and Bert Larkin are having a go with 4 other men , we don't expect tp hear for a month how we get on but I personally think we are ok the money is poor so so it of course doesn't meet with Teddy's approval, &pound;80 per year isn't much to keep a [indecipherable] on but it doesn't trouble me, I'm out for promotion so I hope for my own sake that I have the luck to get one.  In the evening my squad has lamps Bed at 10pm</p>
<p>22 January 1915<br/>Friday</p>
<p>Stables as usual.<br/>Nothing of much importance took place today but all preparations are being made for the "big" scheme tomorrow Col [indecipherable] came over today and asked us where we were going to &amp;he was told on a scheme &amp; laughed for as he said how is it possible to have a scheme [indecipherable] so again Teddy is up in arms again.  Larkin is on leave &amp; Toby has heard of his accident the motor repairs have been passed for payment but the CO has complained to the Pay Master about the senseless advisibility of it so he is personally [indecipherable] on the subject also the NZ are [indecipherable] for the "Enfields" bikes so another chance lost to the Signal Troop we expect to move off at nine in the morning I'm riding a push bike thanks to the Boss. Bed at 9.30</p>
