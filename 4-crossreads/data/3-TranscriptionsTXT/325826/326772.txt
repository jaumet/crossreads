 6.  Lieutenant Arthur Treloar (once of Chatswood S.School), Sergeant Norman Jeehan (lives in Chatswood used to go to school when I did), Corporal Cecil Watt (Chatswood stationmaster's son), Corporal Norman Winn (one of W. I. Winn's boys that we knew in Newcastle), Lance-Corporal Charlie Westbrook (Chatswood S.S.) and Private Powers whose sisters at school used to talk about Anna, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And going home I met a Nurse whom I used to go to school with as a little girl someone called Daisy Wearne.  Now do you believe the millions.

He spoke so nicely of them at home, in such a loving loyal way yet with all the blunt boyishness of the lad of twenty that I could have howled.  I may see him again or not for he has just finished a course at a machine-gun school at Zeitoun &amp; is being moved somewhere else now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could tell you lots more about this sunshiny lad but I don't want to bore you though I know you will be glad of the little break it made for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so much alone &amp; often for days scarcely speak to a soul beyond the morning salute, that it is almost an event to see someone
