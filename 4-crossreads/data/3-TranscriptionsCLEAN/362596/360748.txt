Bois de Bologne. It is a huge park with lakes and shady nooks we spent a great day on the water. I was very fortunate while I was down there I had a Canadian Sgt. and a friend out of this Brigade to knock around with and they were great sports. The Theatres in Paris are very poor and a wee bit on the rough side and they are carried on much different to ours in Aust. or England but one can enjoy themselves. Well of course my 8 days soon slipped by and I had to come back to the line and for     another hop over and my Officer had gone on to Blighty
