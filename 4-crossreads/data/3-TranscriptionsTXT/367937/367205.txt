 When I was down at Tel-el-Kebir I thought I would have to send that money I brought back home but I'm jolly glad I did not now, as there is tons to spend it on here. I have bought a khaki drill coat to wear here; when we get back to Tel-el-Kebir we will be issued with summer suits but I know I will never get a coat to fit me as I am not a regulation size and I wanted to have something nice in case I ever get any leave up to Cairo.  The coat I have got is a very good one and fits well; it cost 75 Pt which I thought was pretty cheap.  I met Lin Alworth yesterday; he has had slight Enterric and is here convalescent.  Max &amp; Charlie are both in the A.S.C. My word! I will be glad to get my mail back at camp I have not had any letters at all from you yet and I dont know how anything is going on at home.  I hope you are having a decent winter. I am sending you 14 photos; please let me know if any of them are censored. This afternoon we are going out to have a look at the museam, they say it is not much of a one but we want to have a look at everything. I wanted to send mother home something for a present but I cant see anything she would like:  she would not wear a silk scarf and jewellery is not much.  Views of Egypt seem to me to be the only thing.  Good bye Father I am your loving son Rob.
