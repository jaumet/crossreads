however we had a good walk round, and returned to camp just in nice time for tea. Have not seen Jim Elder lately he was away from the Bn. Last time, that I inquired for him and since then I have not been able to look him up, however will give your message when I see him again have not heard from the Wallington folk since I returned from leave, but may hear at any time now. Latest letters that have come along so far are the January lot, except more will come along in a few days, hope so anyway.
There is little news just at present, war is the only subject that is worth writing about here, and you will get quite enough of it in the papers without me trying to tell you about it, and if Harry is not able to tell you all you want to hear about it well its no use me trying, for Ive been, neutral for some time.
