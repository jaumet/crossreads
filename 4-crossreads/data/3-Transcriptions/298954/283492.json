<p>1917<br/>Thur. 28th June.<br/>In Tasman Sea steering due West.   Beautiful weather, a smooth oily sea &ndash; several smoke-clouds on horizon.</p>
<p>Our food is now quite insufficient &ndash; the boilers have been "broken down" (so our hosts say) for the last week and our principal meal consists of the wet dough mis called bread, a little butter, black coffee and a minute dole of "Mrs Crippen".</p>
<p>Tue. 3rd July.<br/>The mines were brought up early &ndash; the whole of the rail under the poop were filled preparatory to laying a very big field.   The horns were all in position.   At about ten pm. the mines began to go over the side.</p>
<p>31 had been laid when an interruption came.   Those under the tube declared that a torpedo was fired &ndash; at any rate the "Wolf" suddenly started off with many mines still on the upper rails.</p>
