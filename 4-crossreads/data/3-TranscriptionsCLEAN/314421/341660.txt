  
 1. Orders came through late last night that we were to move off at mid day today. Hasty preperations were made for a start. Equipment put together. Packed got ready & blankets rolled. Then waggons were loaded, and the stores removed. I packed 8 cases of shoes, although I was on no duties. I did not parade sick although I had the necessary parade stakes. Holmes returned yesterday and helped the other farriers to shoe some horses this morning. 
 At 1. p.m. we left Belguim and passed through Ledinghem, Drouville enroute to Merck St. Sievin, a railway town. We arrived at 5.15 after several stoppages on the road for the day was very hot and there were some very steep and long hills to cross over. After tea I had a look around the Village. It has a magnificent church and a fine stream of water passes through the Village which is spanned by a fine stone bridge. Lower down the stream there are two water wheels working a large Mill. There are a number of Estaminets &  Dehitants.. At one of them I obtained a number of Post card views of the Village, & also some at a little shop.
