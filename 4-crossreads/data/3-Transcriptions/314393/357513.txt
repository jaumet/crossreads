<p>It was very sleepy body of men when they alighted on the platform but the fresh morning air soon had everyone wide awake. After waiting for a short while the party was marched to a big Imperial rest camp where we were told we would remain for a couple of hours. While waiting here rations were issued followed by a very rough &amp; scanty breakfast which served as a good breaking in for the future. Our next move took place at 9AM when the party was marched through Folkestone down onto the wharf &amp; straight about the S.S. princess Henry a channel troopship embarking about 10 AM. The ship was crowded to standing room with trips, who were mostly Imperial men returning to France after their furlough at home. Things were quiet on board for everyone seemed very sorry for themselves. Remembrances of the past few days were still fresh in their minds but were rapidly overcome by thoughts of the future for no one knew what it was to be; would we ever enjoy more good times in the old country which indeed to the "Aussie" had been a home away from home.

When we arrived at the camp the party was allotted to tents then being able to indulge in a well earned rest. There was nothing doing in the camp that day so late in the afternoon several of us obtain leave to go into the city of La Havre. The time spent in the city was very enjoyable for there are many places of interest but the most of these could not be seen owing to the darkness for lights were very much restricted on account of enemy aircraft.
