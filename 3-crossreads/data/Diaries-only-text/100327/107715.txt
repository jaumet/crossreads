The navy ("Europa" principally) opened up very heavy bombardment about noon socking in broadsides into Olive Grove with deafening noise and provoking no reply beyond a few odd seventyfives. Most of the lads however remarked "We'll have to pay for this"! One chap in a letter says "I am so greasy that if you look at me your eyes slip off". Fortunately we now get a full ration of water. 
A company of the 25th Battn. is attached to us, Stockfeld going away sick sent up from the beach a fowl he had there to Roth. It escaped and some 25th caught it, condemned it to death and put it in the pot. We made it rather a joke against the two 25th officers we have in the mess that their men as "visitors" to this Regiment should do such a deed! Colonel Gwynne round and our line is to be further re-arranged. We take on Wire Gully and extend as before along to B8. As recompense for increased line we get all mining taken off us by 21st who go into reserve and we also get our beach party back. 
Colonel Spencer Brown goes to Egypt (he has asthma) to organize a L.H. unit. Persistent rumours that I am to be Staff Captn 6th Brigade ? a job I don't want as my promotion to Major will come sooner by waiting here for my company. The weather dull close a total change to the cold snap. Evenings quite warm Abdul has partly put out another inner row of entanglement behind his others. In places the old ones are very knocked about by our shells
