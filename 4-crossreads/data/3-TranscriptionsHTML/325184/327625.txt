<p>Col Pollock motored through and round the city gaining a general impression of its Geography. After dinner at Hotel went with General  Malcolm to the Palais du Danse, quite a good show, and tho' the ladies were "demi monde" conduct was exemplary. Hotel exceedingly comfortable and up to date, also the Hotel Adlon in "Unter den Linden" street, both built by the same architect</p>
<p>Thursday 3rd July<br/>Breakfast at Hotel with Col Pollock, then with him spent the morning walking round the City.   Well planned municipality but buildings very disappointing . Parks very good. In afternoon continued my walks and by dinner time I had gained an excellent idea of the lay out of the City. Tramway strike on &ndash; Public using lorries and vehicles of all description. Boche troops posted to maintain order.   Hindenburgs' [indecipherable] figure very interesting and a good likeness. General Malcolm's task intensely interesting.  All nationalities to deal with.   Wended my way to train at 10pm and secured my sleeping berth. Train actually moved out at 11pm<br/>Friday 4th July.</p>
<p>Arrived Cologne 11.15 am. Car met me.   Changed into uniform and called at GHQ. Found a ceremonial parade in progress. The Belgian Army Commander was to present a number of decorations to British officers and men. A guard of honour provided. Gen Robertson present and all Corps and Divisional Commanders. A very nice ceremony. Lunched with Gen Montgomery and left Cologne at 2.30pm for Utrecht in Holland, via  [indecipherable], the Netherlands [indecipherable] having provided me with the necessary papers.<br/>From [indecipherable] to Utrecht the country is very pretty roads flanked with fine residences and everywhere an atmosphere of wealth and comfort. Gardens particularly fine. Passed through the village of [indecipherable] the residence of the Kaiser.  Reached Utrecht 8pm arranged accommodation at Hotel den Pay Bas . Very comfortable and good table. After dinner strolled round town. Cathedral nave missing. I understand as the result of fire, while the West end Campanile remains intact. Very pretty walks along the Canals.</p>
