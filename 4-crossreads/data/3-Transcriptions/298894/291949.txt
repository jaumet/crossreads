<p>arriving about 8.30 P.M. Strange to say I was seasick on the voyage, perhaps because my inside was wrong. No definite orders for us on our arrival so we turned in but 10 of us were hauled out about 10.30 P.M., had to pack up &amp; leave for another ship. It had started to rain &amp; we first had to go to the pier to get medical supplies &amp; then to the S.S. Fauvette. Damp &amp; trying to be cheerful we arrived at 1 A.M. &amp; then turned in for the night. We had a large number of Scotties aboard &amp; sailed for the Dardanelles arriving 6 A.M.</p>

The turks shelled the shore a little but nothing serious.</p>
<p>Sunday 4th Nothing exciting during the morning barring a little shelling of the shore but we witnessed a tragedy later. At midday a French Battleship came up with destroyers &amp; commenced bombarding the Asiatic shore the Turks replying &amp; landing a few around our ship &amp; amongst the ordnance stores on shore. A heavy explosion also took place in</p>
