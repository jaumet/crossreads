Watten I passed a Bifur Board which indicates a Junction ahead & which is a Triangle to a Branch line, I received the first all clear signal & crept on to the next, I could not see it for a while as it was very dim & all of a sudden I found it & applied my Brake but could not stop in time & ran past it an Engine length exploding the Detonator which is placed on the line & is removed by the signal coming off, anyhow the French Signal Man was more anxious for some Coal than the Detonator & I soon satisfied him & off again & did not stop until I was received a Red light at a Semaphore Signal outside of Vendreu Marshalling yard where it was decided where my train was to terminate as between Vendru there are several yards & Calais, after a few minutes stop I was shunted into Vendru Yard & left my train & ran Light Engine past [indecipherable] Station & into the Loco Depot, from Vendru [indecipherable] [indecipherable]
