<p>Sunday 16 April 1916<br/>Col. Fuller in charge of Church Parade, very quiet in Camp all Day.<br/>Writing Home.  These camps that we occupy seem to be stepping stones to some big movement that the <u>Anzac Mounted Division</u> is contemplating.  The men are disappointed in having to lie idle so long, &amp;amp; one wonders why so many valuable lives are not put somewhere handy to the Enemy's position.  All interest in Drill &amp;amp; disipline fades away, when there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>Monday 17 April 1916<br/>Regimental parade very Hot.<br/>Scaffording erected on which Sacks of Straw are hung for Baynoit Exercise.  5th Reg. putting in a good deal of time at  this class of work.<br/>Col. Wilson of the 5th Regiment is the Senior Col. of the 2nd L.H. Brigade &amp;amp; Major Newton is adjutant.<br/>The 5th are also fortunate in securing the services of a well tried M.O. whose name is Major McClean.</p>
<p>Tuesday 18 April 1916<br/>Orders out to rise at 5 a.m. owing to Hot Weather.  Baynoti Exercise &amp;amp; Trench digging to be the order of the day.<br/>Much talk about shifting soon to some other spot.  One would think we we paid to tour Egypt, for we certainly see a vast amount of Country.</p>
<p>Wednesday 19 April 1916<br/>Regiment left at 4 p.m. for all night stunt at Outpost Duty about 3 miles from Camp.  I camped with H.Q. staff &amp;amp; enjoyed the outing immensely.  Brig. Ryrie inspected the outpost at 10-30 p.m.<br/>Picket pegs are of no use in Sand so we fill up Sand Bags &amp;amp; sink them in ground tying Head Ropes on Same.</p>
