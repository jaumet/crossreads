 Thursday Aug 2nd Two leaves in London. one &ndash; returned A.W.L. &amp; received a day's F.P. No 2. Second quite unexpected &amp; so enjoyable all the more. Lily's birthday -  small autograph album must better it later.  Small disturbance at home with D.Q. with Molloy for the front apparently. Have written him, but would not call when in London 
 Mental upheaval that caused, the letters to Rita to become more regular have not subsided
