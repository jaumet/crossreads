Pace as long as one liked, so you see, a donkey ride is cheap enough here. I haven't seen anything decent to send home yet, but will have a look round for a souvenir shortly.  I am writing this in the YMCA room at Tel El Kebir, there are several and I can tell you are very welcome to a chap who has a few letters to write. There is no certainty that we will remain here for long, we are prepared to a move at anytime. There is a chance of seeing England before we get to the front but I think it unlikely. Its getting time for bed Mother so I'll have to sign off, 4 a.m. each morning is my rising hour. In case I don't write to the boys let them know how I am getting on. I am thankful to say that I am feeling in the best of health and trust to God that I will continue to do so.
Trusting that all at home are well
With fondest loveYour loving SonGordon.Let Ted Carrigan have a look.
