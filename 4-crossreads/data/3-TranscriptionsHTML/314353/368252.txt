<p>November 15<br/>Mail last night from Victoria: This week is missing the Literary Supplement.</p>
<p>Due now from T.B.C. 'Good Friday', 'Twinkletoes' and "Sacrifice", 'Philip the King' and the two books from Beaumonts &ndash; so looked forward to, still to arrive.  The 15/- from Nick to go to Bakers, after 'Chastelard' arrives, for Collected Poems of James Elroy Flecker&hellip;.</p>
<p>Parade at 10 and foot inspection parade again at 11 and a route march till 12.30, Dinner directly on return&hellip;.</p>
<p>Major Frizelle reported slowly mending &ndash; still too bad to move though and Capt. Black, wounded in a  Artillery Detail, still dangerously hanging on&hellip;.</p>
<p>Wrote this morning to Windsor  &amp; Newton for general catalogues.</p>
<p>127.<br/>Evening, ..Johnny back from leave&hellip;.  I asked him a while back, "Well Johnnie, and how's old Edinburgh looking!"  "Oh, very quiet &ndash; just the same&hellip; a bit quieter than before the war&hellip;  Not many men about &ndash; but plenty of Aussies!"</p>
<p>This afternoon directly after dinner off by self with Keats, for a walk across fields behind us&hellip; a mile away in a valley of three hills, a shepherd and his sheep.. a rustick loveliness, land of softly rising lawns and straight lines of trees&hellip; and straight bounding a dawdling road a wood of green lichened trees, and foliage of "Autumn's gawdy liveries"&hellip; deep over the red pathway soft layers of large fallen leaves.. silence broken only by a sudden startling of some birds, black silhouettes against flecked gold. .. A passionate paganism was the spirit of the place&hellip; a desire to assume the atmosphere and rush madly over the dead-leaved carpet- to spoil with red blood the beauty of a white-gold naide.</p>
<p>At the other side of the wood faintly through the tall trees and high undergrowth foliage, sweeping pasturing land of soft buff colours, and blue hills behind.</p>
<p>Our original intention was on going down to the stream for a bathe.. a quick crystal stream over smooth coloured stones,..Eric G. &amp; Frank S. and self..they working though in Orderley Room.</p>
