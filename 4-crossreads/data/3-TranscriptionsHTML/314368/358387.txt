<p>Hollyside.<br/>West Hill<br/>Highgate<br/>London<br/>July 2</p>
<p>Dear Mother<br/>I came up to London three days ago on furlough and am now doing my turn of sightseeing. Mrs Cust, the lady who I am staying with met me at Euston station and after I had completed my business at Headquarters was good enough to be my guide for my first day in London. She is an exceptionally nice woman , no one could help but like her, and she treats me just as her own son, Her husband Vice Admiral Cust is at present in command of one of the flotillas in the North Sea, and her son Jack is in command of one of the destroyers, She has one daughter too, a dear little kid of 12, Peggie and we have such good times together. This is a lovely house, one of the real old English sort with nice grounds at the back and is right up on the hill at Highgate. Front my window I can see</p>
