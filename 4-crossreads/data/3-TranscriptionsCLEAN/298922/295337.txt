 El Risa 
 "Pow Wow" at B.H.Q. re our action - General  Chauvel  rode alongside coming home & said "The boys did well" a little courteousness & thanks go a long way when all a mans nerves are on edge & he's dog-tired. 
 We brought in a number of Bedouin & their Camels along with Turkish prisoners. Prisoners were fat & fit. What I have told you is only a part of proceedings. The 1, 2, 3 Regts. & N.Z.M.R. were all in it with Tommy Batteries of 8 guns. Will give you more particulars later, busy reorganising. 5th Mtd. Brigade of Yeomanry were on one flank & got badly cut up. Gloucesters Warwicks & Worcestershire brids. did well & many died gallantly.
