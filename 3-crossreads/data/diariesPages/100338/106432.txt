May
I was required to do, that the civilian got that wild and disgusted with me, so that he did all the work himself while I looked on.
On Friday seven more guards were sent to look after us, and prevent us from escaping. The German civilians also have to keep their eyes on us. They have to come to the barrack and take us to work at 6pm, and in the mornings they have to bring us back and hand us over to the Guards at the barrack. They are held responsible if we escape during working hours.

A rumour has come to hand that all British Prisoners of forty-five years of age, married with two or more children are to be repatriated to England. And also all prisoners captured up till the 1st of December 1916 are to be repatriated to Holland. The weather for some weeks has been nice & pleasant with the exception of one or two very wet days.

The food has been as usual. (bad.)
