Hospital system Egypt Malta & England. The men are being fed well to buck them up, getting eggs rice etc also a large bottle of Stout between two men one day & beer the next. Something like reasonable treatment as it prevents men buying illicit grog etc. We had commenced packing to move to Anzac when we received orders to cease & prepare for 500 patients which we duly received last night. For how long our move will be delayed I do not know.
Monday 20 & Tuesday 21st Sept. Had a swim Monday afternoon & found the water cooler than usual winter beginning to creep on. Today we borrowed a boat from Pier master at 4 P.M. & had a sail around the harbour, little things like this help to keep one fit.
Tuesday 28th Sept. and October 2nd. Last 12 days just even going. Having received some printing paper from Egypt managed to get time to print some photoes for which purpose I borrowed films from other fellows & some of the officers & picked out the best. I managed to do over 100 & all being picked formed a very fair collection The weather taking a warm turn I managed to get a couple of swims
