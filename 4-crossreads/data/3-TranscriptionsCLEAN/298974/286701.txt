At Suez Port Said we took on 200 wounded English Tommies. They are a wonderful lot of chaps. There is no more emotion in them than if they were going to the front instead of returning. Some have gammy legs, other arms in slings. Several have eyes shot out & ears off. One cant sit down.
Another poor devil was shot through the neck and the bullet came out the right ear. He is deaf on one side & dumb for life. There is a V.C. man too, who I have had the honour of chatting with. He is a remarkably reserved chap, but tells his tale very interestingly. He only held a trench single handed all one night!
Well Ma, I am pretty well, but just for the last few days have had a touch of gastritis. The food is now the limit, but will be all right in a day or so.
Give best love to all
Lovingly
Dene.
