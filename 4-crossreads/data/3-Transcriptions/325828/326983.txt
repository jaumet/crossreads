<p>Havre, France.<br/>Saturday 10.11.16.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>You will be surprised, no doubt, to find me writing from this address, but when I tell you I am on my way to England on leave you will understand.  Things were running on smoothly much as usual a week ago, last Monday to be correct, when a notice was posted up at H.Q. saying that those requiring Leave had better apply.  I saw the Colonel about it &amp; receiving his permission, <strike>put in</strike> wrote out my application <strike>in writing</strike>to our Camp Commandant, handing it to Colonel Sturdee before putting it in to the C.C. at the Colonel's request.  He endorsed it &amp; adding a note in which he strongly recommended it.  This was on Tuesday morning<br/>On Wednesday at 12 o'clock I was greatly surprised to be told my application was granted &amp; that I was to go on leave the following day.  At 1 o'clock (an hour later) a despatch came through from Army H.Q. canceling all Leave for the Division.  I didn't think any more about it until 7 o'clock that night when the Colonel called me aside &amp; told me he was trying to push my leave through for me, as he was very anxious I should go</p>
