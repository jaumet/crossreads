Sunday Mch 23rd
Hurrah For The Guards!
Enthusiastic Scenes at Firt Official Pageant of Victory.
Prince's Great Welcome.
The streets of London were the setting of one of the most moving sights of the war yesterday when the march past of the Guards took place. 
Over 8000 Officers and Men took part and there were scenes of unbounded enthusiasm as the great procession passed through the streets of the West End and the City. The King took the Salute at Buckingham Palace and the Prince of Wales rode with the Guards as a member of Lord Cavan's Staff.
The Prince was given a tremendous reception at every point of the route and his hand was continually at the salute.
