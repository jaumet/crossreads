Can hear little birds singing around, as a rule they are very scarce. Several bushes covered densely with yellow flowers ? the only blooms seen so far since arrival. Quiet day with shower of rain in afternoon which we could see coming miles away over the ship strewn sea and over from Suvla Bay. Went up to observation post and pulled sandbag out and had a quiet look through my telescope at the trenches of our dear friend. Such an untidy place spotted loop holes c but really at such short distance the naked eye almost takes it all in. 
At dark 3 men crept out and went as far as C - , found it consists of two separate holes both with little holes like trap doors in the bottom Returned unseen and reported, only the usual exchange of shots and bombs going on this evening really nothing special. 
The man Reed who has been missing for some days suffering from loss of memory, wandering along beach near 1 Div. HQ, turned up again in charge of someone who found him quite deranged and a nervous wreck and he will have to be sent away at once. Quite normal until about a week ago when a shell blew him clean off the firing step but did not injure him. 
Quiet night and so to bed

Rain, and cold wind pitch dark. Evidently raining again during the night. Growing dawn ? glimpse of Cape Gaba Tepe through break in the sap. The beach cemetery looking well kempt and neat. Good swim off lighter and clean and fresh after it, well worth the tiring climb back. Passed thick patch of graves on hillside. Officer's, and at his feet scores of little tin wooden crosses in rows. In fire trench 2 .
Lovely sunshine at 0900 noted two birds singing but could not se them
