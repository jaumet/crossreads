than I had originally intended  -
Suva ladies are mostly washed out - the climate is against them  -  They are wan & pallid  -  Some are all right  -  They are the recent arrivals  -  From an eugenic point of view only 2 or 3 of those present were to my mind of at all good physique  -  Mab is a far finer girl than any girl I've seen here  -  The open air life & greater activity of men makes tremendously in their favor  -
When we got to the beach we took the ladies to the Upolu  -  The Upolu had come up to the wharf in the afternoon for water & we are to stay some 4 days  -  We gave them champagne & at last a chaperone said to me - We ought to go home & I said you must act firmly or you wont get home with your charges at all if these officers can detain you by talk & hospitality  -  She took my point & then we all went with them to the pier head - said goodbye & got inboard & I got to my bunk about 1 am  -
