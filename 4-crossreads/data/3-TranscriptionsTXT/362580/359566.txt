 It is rumoured that we will have to wear nothing but our uniform soon &ndash; Wont we look beautiful in our bonnets, especially in this country &ndash; Suppose we shall wear helmets.  I daresay I shall be on duty next time I write. 
 Sister Dickenson (Mrs. Barrie's friend) left for Lemnos with 32 others, yesterday morning.  They were a bit nervous at going so near the firing line but the sickness there is simply fearful &ndash; and require plenty of nurses &amp; doctors &ndash; I only wish I had been well enough to go but we are not allowed &ndash; only the new reinforcements &ndash; hard luck &ndash; Have just heard that I'm to go to Alexandria to-morrow, with Sister Knox &ndash; she has been on night-duty here &amp; is an awfully nice girl also is a great friend of Essie Craig's &amp; knows Mr. Cunningham, so my luck is in.  Shall try &amp; write a few letters from there.  This is a rotten letter I know.  Taken about 3 hrs to write, interrupted so much. 
 Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. 
 From Your loving sister, Edith.
