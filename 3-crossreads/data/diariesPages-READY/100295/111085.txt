heedless of the fact that his turn might be next instant. It's a damnable business. I wake up in the morning as though I had passed through some weird wild dream. Its impossible to realise that men are just murdering each other around you, that you are in the heart of a great battle. The frightful roar of artillery scream of shell though brings one to reality, but even it passes off as soon as you leave the scene of battle, when I am back again in my cosy room at Steenvorde, I quickly forget the horrible doings of the day after a good dinner, develop my plates then turn in with no more thoughts for the day, than if I had been at business all the while, had just returned from a late evening working overtime!
