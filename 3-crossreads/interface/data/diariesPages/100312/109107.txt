The ground floor is a grotto round which runs a stream with little rills of water. Really an extraordinary place. 
Reached bed well after midnight. Up and had a hot bath at 8.30 and then went by Metro. to the Gare du Lyon to book my passage for Modane. The Metro. is one of Paris? wonders, so clean and handy. Stewart and Co. are going out to Versailles today and have nice weather for it. The trees are losing more leaves everyday and by a fortnight's time the aspect of winter should be all over the city. Went down to the Elysee Palace at 11.30 and met .E. Together we made the streets and went round shopping. Paris has an enormous stomach and morning is the time to see tons of foodstuffs ranging from fine wine to chestnuts changing hands. Grocery shops stocked full of all delicacies and discriminating buyers there busy. To Cafe de la Paix for lunch and then to Cooks and paid 1000
