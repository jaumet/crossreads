<p>arrival rejoined us.</p>
<p>At 10 am, wreckage, consisting of casks, cases and a lifeboat were passed, and a little later, two corpses (which were later picked up, so I believe). The wreckage was that of the steamer "Diomed" which had been torpedoed only 18 hours prior to our arrival in that zone, and, mighty glad were we in knowing that we had such reliable protection as we did.</p>
<p>At 3-30 pm the famous Eddy-Stone was sighted and at 4 pm in all the glory of a beautiful English evening we entered Plymouth harbour which I thought absolutely the most glorious place on god's earth. The hills surrounding appeared so picturesque that I immediately conceived a liking for England which I kew would take a lot to supplant, and a great ovation was accorded us as we passed the numerous destroyers and several training ships which lay in the harbour.</p>
<p>At 7 pm an unexpected order was issued for disembarkation to commence at once, and, until 10-30 pm every chap in our unit went his hardest, handling, firstly the convalescent men, secondly their own belongings, &amp; thirdly the hundreds of portmanteaux, trunks, bags etc which were aboard.</p>
