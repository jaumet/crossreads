 Saturday 6 July Absolutely quiet all day & not a shot fired by Fritz.  Glorious day. An American Sergeant was attached to this post & he is good to talk to. The Australian ideas as to the American words of command were very amusing to him. They were Aust - Slope arms American - Guys muskets on your shoulders put. Aust - Eyes right or left American - Guys look at 'em Aust - Attention American - Guys stiffen Aust - Stand at Ease American - Guys Slacken However, the Sergeant exploded all these ideas & was much amused. Their words of command are similar to ours.
