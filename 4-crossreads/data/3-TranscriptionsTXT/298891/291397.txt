 10 Saturday 
 Day off.  Sister Davis &amp; I caught a French touring car at the Cross Roads &amp; went to Berinbza arriving at 11.45.  We spent the time looking at houses &amp; came back with the nice young French officer who dropped us at the hospital at 4.30.  Some sunshine but some grey also. Came on to rain at night.
