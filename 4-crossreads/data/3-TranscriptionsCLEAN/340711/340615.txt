  
 picked for Howitzer Brigade. 
 Friday, 10. Am spending 1/2 piastre per day, that on a newspaper. We are on Active Service. No Canteens etc. Only two latrines that can be called such. Simply a desert of heavy sand. Food-active service. Sergeants' Mess, an old board---a couple of chunks of wood for seats---open air---and at night bitterly cold. Meals any hour Third inoculation---for Typhoid and Para-typhoid---very big dose. Arm very painful. I felt it all over body and had to lay up all day. Received a letter from home dated 28/1/16 and addressed Maribyrnong. 
 Saturday, 11. Transferred this morning to B.A.C. 6th. Brigade as Corporal---provisionally (one month) F. Subsection. Rotten W.O. Always growling or whining. Has no direct appeal to men. Watered horses three times per day---also groomed and fed them. 
 In tent with McCleave, Les White, Len Marshall, Sam Crute. It is fine to be with them. 
 Sunday, 12. Church Parade for whole 6th Brigade. Poor sermon the little I could hear of it---so wrote up my diary during service. After review of whole division by General ---. 
 Monday, 13. Usual routine---watering and grooming and feeding. M., who retained his three stripes, gave us 70 minutes foot drill before breakfast. The men detest him. He is a school teacher and treats us as kids. He has studied psychology, but his horizon is the text book, and applied psychology is unknown to him. 
 It is fine to sit round the candle in the tent at night with all the old fellows.
