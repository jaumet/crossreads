<p>December 1916</p>
<p>draining job near the camp.  Whilst in this camp "A" Coy played "C" Coy football &amp; "A" won by 8 points to 6.  Our Major also return to the battalion &amp; was made Lt. Colonel a few days later. On the 15th Dec we had to pack up &amp; march to Meualte &amp; and went into huts &amp; was on fatigue loading &amp; unloading trains.  Our stay here however was short for on the 20th we again packed up &amp; marched to huts in Melbourne camp Marmetz &amp; stayed for the night.  Next morning we moved off to Bernafay &amp; again stayed overnight in huts.  It was during the afternoon of the 22nd when we left Bernafay &amp; my company went right into the firing line which consisted of outposts &amp; I was put in charge of No 9 night post &amp; had three men with me. It was a rather cold job for we went on post at dusk &amp; stayed till dawn &amp; was exposed to all weather &amp; was a case of marking time the whole time to keep warm but we got a small rest of a day.  All night long on the 23rd Fritz shelled the post &amp; during the early hours of the next morning he made it that hot that I had to move the post.  Our relief came on the night of the 24th when "D" Coy relieved us &amp; we went back to supports.  Supports were situated at Battalion H. Quarters &amp; we were in a big tunnel but there was only sitting room.  Our duties here we too carry rations</p>
