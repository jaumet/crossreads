<p>Desert Life</p>
<p>I spilled some water on desert sand.<br/>(It's far too precious to waste.)<br/>The effect was like a grasping hand,<br/>Imbibing in frenzied haste.<br/>Swiftly it soaked in the desert's thirst,<br/>Like raindrops on furnace fires<br/>Raced with the hot wind to drink it first<br/>Quenching the angry desires.</p>
<p>The desert, our neutral enemy<br/>He's partial to neither side &ndash;<br/>Mocking at mortal's impunity<br/>And the powers that divide.<br/>The sentry rides on the dim skyline<br/>of a barren wilderness,<br/>A woeful camel train, the only sign<br/>of life, in his loneliness.</p>
<p>Picture the Bedouin desert born!<br/>And his wall of imagination,<br/>Picture the Trooper Austral born,<br/>And the hot sands inspiration.<br/>Our lives seem likened to waterdrops<br/>As we ride through pulseless heat<br/>For man's own soul the desert sops,<br/>Achieving his great defeat.</p>
