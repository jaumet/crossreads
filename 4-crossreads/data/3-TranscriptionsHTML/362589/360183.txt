<p>came over here and we had no chance to get together. I saw Walter Macallum in hospital a couple of days ago. He had been there over 2 weeks &amp; was then almost recovered but of course awfully weak. He seemed very pleased to have a visitor and incidentally could not speak highly enough of the excellent treatment he was getting. I saw Gordon Passte about a week ago. He was looking very fit but was rather cut up about the strength of his command.<br/>Richards has been sent back sick. I have not heard anything of Flannery over here. He left Egypt a good while before us.<br/>I myself am fitter than I have ever been before except that I am a bit on the fat side and soft from want of variety in exercise. I have just received temporary promotion to rank of Captain. It sounds quite nice.<br/>There is practically no news. Winter is coming on rapidly &amp; the nights are nippy I think bombs will be much worn this winter, in fact they are all the rage<br/>in Gallipoli this month.<br/>I received two pipe lighters from you. Thanks, they are a great success. I got something similar in Egypt but not nearly so good<br/>I don't think there is anything I particularly want I have plenty of clothes for</p>
