<p>London<br/>Tuesday<br/>16-1-17<br/>Daddy dear,<br/>I am sending you out 3 copies of the "Mirror", one of Londons dailies with a photo of Wally on the front page taken in the 3rd L.G.H. just after he was presented with his Military Cross.<br/>I am off back to Camp now at Salisbury Plains to go before a Medical Board before returning to France.<br/>Very cold here today.  It <strike>is</strike> has been snowing all night &amp; the snow is falling still.  In Kent I hear it is 10 ft thick.  At Essex (Woodford) where I was staying with the Limns it was about 8" thick this morning.<br/>Love to all.  I am keeping well.<br/>Leo.</p>
