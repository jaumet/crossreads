The wall supporting the dome was filled in with lovely windows finished in the Gothic style, and ornamented with figures of Saints etc.  These windows appeared to form the background for a beautiful piece of work in an elegant framework and under this structure was a figure in the lying posture of one of their martyrs.

It is tip top, but I am afraid that the people's lives are not altogether in keeping with their lovely Churches.  Well, I am travelling in the train now and I do not know where I am bound, but we have just passed through Caestre, Croiches, Tuchel, Doullens.  We disentrain at Doullens at 2.30 p.m.  We leave 2.45 p.m. and march on through Bagneux at which village we halt for dinner at 4 p.m.  We leave Bagneuse about 5.15 p.m., then on to Candas, where we see the Flying Corps men, and arrive at Canaples at about 8.30 p.m.  March distance about nine and a half miles.  We are billeted for the night.  Retire about 10 p.m. and bivouac for the night and have a good night's rest.</p>
