after coming out in the fresh air we went along to a Y. M. C. A. & had some rhubarb & custard, cake & coffee & then we walked slowly home along the pretty little wooded lanes, a slight shower had fallen & things looked beautiful & smelt better21st.  Still hot & showery, one minute it is raining like blazes the next the sun comes out blazing hot, I find the heat over here much more trying than the Australian heat, for it is so moist.Went down to see Len after dinner today but he had gone out on a dray picnic.  I met Roy. Cattell one of my old Cpl's down there so we had a yarn The old Froggie's seem to be giving Fritzie something more than he bargained for in this last offensive of his, what wonderful people these French are, the world can never give them enough credit or
