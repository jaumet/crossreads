 24 July 1915 Saturday 
 Our guns kept up a hail of lead &amp; high explosive on the Chessboard all night &amp; this had gone on through out the day. The beggars are going to let us down after all &amp; I think they have taken a tumble as to what awaits them over here. A mail arrived today but I only got one from Bert M who ought to be back any day now. The Turks have now French Mortars in use so that ought to even things up a trifle. Rumors afloat by the mile is troops are to land between here &amp; Tepe also 1700 of Ks army to give us a hand here. CO &amp; 2 operators to stand by for duty at Imbros on GHQ we resumed duty today at 12 &amp; glad of the change. At sunset the Turks opened fire with all their guns on our positions the heavy howitzers did a good deal of damage to our earthworks although no men were hit. They got 16 men at the beach this morning with shrapnel &amp; old silent Peter opened up again on the Howitzers who are OK 25 July 1915 Sunday 
 Howitzers busy all night but little or nothing to report only that a party of Turks (50) were caught out reconnatering and destroyed by machine gun fire. The enemy kept up a rain of shrapnel on the beach from both North and South they have brought guns around to the Southern end of the Salt Lake &amp; now they can pitch a shell anywhere in Anzac The same thing applies from the other end. I went down for my usual at 1400 &amp; then visited the Coy just in time to witness a few salvos of shrapnel One beauty demolished a huge stack of biscuits &amp; blew off one mans arm. Ammunition is arriving by the million rounds &amp; very heavy beach parties are needed for the next few days for unloading work. Turks have started to use the incendiary bombs on us but without success as they are easily extinguished. Howitzers got on to a party of Turks at drill &amp; gave em beans. Mail dispatched today
