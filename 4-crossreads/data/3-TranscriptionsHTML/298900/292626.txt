<p>Tuesday 5th Feb<br/> '18   Caught a cold most probably through my bath &amp; felt rather heavy all day.   Took a stroll in the afternoon up to Kemmel Hill, the highest point of the district &amp; a very valuable observation post of ours before the Messines Advance.   'Tis honeycombed with trenches dugouts &amp; tunnels with machine gun possies all strongly built with steel &amp; cement.  Had a good view of the surrounding country but it being hazy it could have been better.</p>
<p>Wednesday 6th Feb<br/>    Had a quiet day and did a little writing also prepared a requisition for stores to be drawn tomorrow.  Had some music at nigh with piano in mess.   Weather beautiful.   A.D.M.S. inspected the place and was very pleased.</p>
<p>Thursday 7th Feb<br/>   Nothing much doing.   Sent my offsider to collect the stores.  Had an evening in the Mess, good fun, singing, piano yarning etc.   Bed about one, feeling O.K. although I had a cold.  Very cold wind blowing all day.</p>
