A The flanders nights                                                       From the Calvary, eastward winds the white road, barred now & filled strewn with pools of molten silver of the full m a harvest moon just clearing as it were the tips of the poplars.                                                                      These are the same poplars that lined this road to see the conqueror pass in the days ere Waterloo. The same old moonlit road.                                                              To the left nesting against the low ridge stands the village, its slender spire agleam. Lights flow behind the curtains of cozy rooms, the tinkling of a well worn tune, a snatch of song, voices & laughter come at intervals       Then a chime of bells commences and a soft wind stirs the leaves  The lights are going out one by one Because Soon all will sleep & dream
