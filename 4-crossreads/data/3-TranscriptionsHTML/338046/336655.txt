<p>1917 &ndash; 18<br/>Dec &ndash; Jan<br/>have a feed up at the Caf&eacute; de la Gare. We the signallers put our 5 francs with one of the smallest platoons &ndash; No 15 &ndash; and our show came off two or three days after New Years Day. We had soup, Turkey, Pork, Beef Dessert and fruit etc and were all well satisfied by the time we finished. It was quite a change from the ordinary fare. One of the officers gave a recital or two. One was 'Jones' recitation and 'Lascia' [Handel]. One of the corporals gave a song. On 5th January I got leave to go to Boulogne. Motor lorries used to leave Desvres every day at noon to take men in. two men in our lorry were sitting on the tailboards. It must have been improperly secured, for all of a sudden it fell back depositing them on the road. Luckily they were not hurt, though how they escaped breaking something or other is a mystery to me as the road was frozen hard. The lorry pulled up and they climbed back in again.
