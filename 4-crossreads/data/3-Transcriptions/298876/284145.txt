<p>No sign of land all day. Passed a good few boats.</p>
<p>Saturday<br/>4/3/16</p>
<p>A very nice day. Sea a bit choppy. Passed the Rock where some big P. &amp; O. Boat was wrecked. The P. &amp; O. Coy are responsible for the upkeep of a light they have placed there at their own cost. It is only attended to now &amp; again, it carries a certain amount of Sulphur &amp; Keop , drip &ndash; drip &ndash; sufficient to make a flickering light. The Patient Pte Lyman who gave me a lot of trouble last night still bad. Dr Argyle says it is appendicitis and requested the Skipper to put a bit more steam on &ndash; so as to get him ashore to operate on him. The difference in speed is very noticeable.</p>
