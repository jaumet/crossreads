<p>[This story is on a form similar to the previous ones sent to Mr A.G. Stephens, Editor NSW Anzac Memorial]<br/>Name and Rank. Britten. H.A. Pvt<br/>Battalion. 41st Battalion<br/>Date when left Australia on service. 8 February 1915<br/>Date when you came back to Australia. 6 December 1915<br/>Answer this question:<br/>Which was the KINDEST THING (or deed, or incident, or person) you saw with your own eyes from the day you left till the day you came back. [The words "KINDEST THING (or deed, or incident, or person) have been crossed out]<br/>The most comical thing that happened during my period of Active Service occured whilst I was in No 1 General Hospital at Heliopolis. It referred to a man who had undergone an operation &amp; who was suffering from the effects of the aether which had been administered.<br/>I don't know his name but he had evidently been a Bullock driver at some time during his life.<br/>As is usual with aether, when the effects are wearing off, a man generally begins to talk which causes an endless amount of amusement to his fellow patients.<br/>This particular chap became very excited of some tam of Bullocks which he imagined he was driving.<br/>He started off by getting them on the move</p>
