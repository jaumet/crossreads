 To a false Patriot (By Sir Owen Seaman, in London "Punch" 
 He came, obedient to the call; He might have shirked like half his mates, Who, while their comrades fight and fall, Still go to swell the football gates. 
 And you, a patriot in your prime, You waved a flag above his head, And hoped he'd have a high old time, And slapped him on the back and said: 
 "You'll show 'em what we British are! Give us your hand, old pal, to shake:" And took him round from bar to bar- And made him drunk &ndash; for England's sake. 
 That's how you helped him. Yesterday, Clear-eyed and earnest, keen and hard, He held himself the soldier's way &ndash; And now they got him under guard. 
 That doesn't hurt you; you're all right; Your easy conscience takes no blame; But he, poor boy, with morning's light, He eats his heart out, sick with shame. 
 What's that to you? You understand Nothing of all his bitter pain; You have no regiment to brand; You have no uniform to stain. 
 No vow of service to abuse, No pledge to King and country due; But he had something dear to lose, And he has lost it &ndash; thanks to you.
