[Wednesday 24 May 1916]Empire DayOur Patrol were in touch with the Tank Patrols today & exchanged a few shotsThe N.Zealanders lost a Pack Horse.All hands hope for a good scrap soon to balance a/c for the Yeomanry losses.  The more one sees of the latter smash, the less palatable it appears.Boils again on the arms.You might post me a Packet of Mighty Coal Tar soap, it lathers in the Brackish Water.  We sleep in our Boots & Clothes every night but nobody minds as we are on the "job" again now.
