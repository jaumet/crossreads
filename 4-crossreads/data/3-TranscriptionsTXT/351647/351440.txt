soon do that & we should get in some good training & be quite ready for action very quickly.
We had a great review yesterday & the Commander in Chief was very struck with our Battery.  We All our horses are chestnuts (I'm glad, Mac will remember how I always preferred chestnuts) & this General loves them too.
I wasn't in it, I'm water cart driver & water carts weren't wanted in the procession.  It seems a lowly job & I'd rather be in a gun team but there are better drivers than I in the battery & a water cart is very necessary & some one has to drive it.  So I'm not growling.  It has compensations.
I have seen Alison twice, also Martin Gibbins who looks splendid.  I'm sorry I didn't see him again but we have so little spare time.
I haven't seen old Duncan but I hear he'll be out here soon.
