1917 Wednesday 21 Feb.
Not much improvement last night today. Its a crook place to be crook in. This is when one misses home The boys attention is rough but kindly. My bingy rejects all food. 
The Doc. has a look at me on the afternoon orders me back to Edward's Post. Ticketed Gastric Enteritis.
Arrive back at Edward's Post about 4 p m found Ridgway Sergt Clifton had been sent down to Bazentin. Hunt keeps me here doses me up. 
Turn in to bunk in dugout put in most joy.
