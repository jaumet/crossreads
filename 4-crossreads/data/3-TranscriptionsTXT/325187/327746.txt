 [Sunday  January 2 1916] 
 Went Cairo for Remounts &amp; in to dinner at Shepherds. With a good bed &amp; decent Tucker a man soon puts on condition again.   I lost 1&frac12; stone with the cold etc at Gallipoli. YMCA here is a great boon to the soldiers, attended service- wrong again should be Sunday   We had a horse running today in Overseas Handicap- at Gezerah had a lot of fun but lost our Pennies  - there are some good Arab Stallions around Cairo.
