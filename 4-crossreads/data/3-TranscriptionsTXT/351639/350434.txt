Cable six section seven    the guns still thundered away at the trenches on top but the Turkish infantry did not seem to care many of them standing boldly up from cover in order to get a better view of the advancing lines of Khaki figures stop   the rifle fire was deafening and I do not think I have ever heard such a din as that produced by the ships guns field pieces bursting shells and thousands of rifles on any battle field before stop  at three fifty the two regiments made a final rush up Yilghin the hill the Inniskillons/Fusiliers a battalion from the west the Border Regiment and another from the south stop  a great solid mass of khaki with bayonets glistening amidst the smoke and dust seemed to emerge from the burnt shrub and surge towards the trenches on top stopFor a few minutes the artillery lengthened their fuses and shelled the reverse slopes leaving the trench line clear stop   the Turks came out on top and fired furiously into the advancing lines some of them seemed to waver for a moment and abandoned the crest running down behind but the majority stuck to their trenches determined to die where they stood stop   our men got high up the hill but on the north side the [censor's deletion - Inniskillons] battalion was brought to a standstill by machine guns and cross fire on the south some of [censor's deletion - the Borderers] our men reached the top and jumped into the trenches where they died fighting amongst the Turks at the point of the bayonet stop   in fact at this southern angle a desperate hand to hand fight took place and never have the enemy fought with greater courage and determination
