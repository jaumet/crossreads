 My dearest Mother   &amp; Sisters 
 No letters this week from Aust. it seems ages since I last heard from home. Suppose shall have to wait patiently now. Anyhow no news is good-news. 
 The weather is delightful   &amp; everything is much brighter. I'm on Night-duty   &amp;  rather enjoying it, the work is very light   &amp;  the nights go by very quickly.
