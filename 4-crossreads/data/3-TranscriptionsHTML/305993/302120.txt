<p>Psathura Island Lt. N.E. 4&frac12;.  We laid the position on the chart &amp; found the whole of the Convoy had steamed over the spot &amp; vicinity unaware of the danger.  Mudros Bay was the place where the H.M. Monotor Raglan &amp; another had been sunk by the German Cruiser Goeben &amp; where the German Cruiser Bleslar was mined &amp; sunk about six months ago.  One of the Hydroplanes dropped some newspapers &amp; official orders on the Jap destroyer K. Mutea.  He tried similar results on the H.M.A. T.B.T. Swan &amp; missed so the Swan put a boat out &amp; picked up the papers in a boat.  The papers being in a water tight bag.  The Swan was steaming 20 knots at the time the sea plane flew 200 feet above him.  The Sea plane finally landed on the water &amp; flew up again spotting submarines.  We passed lots of [indecipherable] logs of wood &amp; wreckage.  The H.M.T. Indarra, Canberra, Burmuda kept on zig zagging &amp; ordered the two cargo boats to steer straight courses on account of the failing to keep up speed to be able to get into Salonika tonight.  This means an increase of 2 miles an hour for us.</p>
