Here &amp; there were plantations in which graceful date-palms were most conspicuous; patches of green showed that some crop was being grown under irrigation but what it was could not be made out: some looked like a cereal, other like Egyptian clover, &amp; once or twice could distinguish sugar-cane.</p>
