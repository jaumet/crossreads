    We have been working very strenuously at organization since landing, losing very little time in eating and sleeping, accomplishing in four days what has taken the other battalions about two weeks.  Now we are to have four days disembarkation leave, starting tomorrow (Monday) until midnight on Thursday. 
    I'm going first to Plymouth, staying perhaps one night, then up to London to look at the King, or rather to buy a few articles, then back to camp nice and early and ready for a really strenuous time in training. 
    My love to you all, 
       Harold.
