  
 It was the loudest that I have heard since we came here, & some shells fell pretty near. It lasted all through the night & slackened off at about 7 a.m. Our heavies seemed to have affair amount to say in affairs. Luckily I did not have much trouble in getting to sleep. To try to sleep when bombs & shells are falling any where near is awful. We had a service in the evacuation hut
