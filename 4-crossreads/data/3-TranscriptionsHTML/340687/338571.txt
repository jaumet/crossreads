<p>September, 1917. Monday 24<br/>Lovely day misty in morning. Set out on pontoons for job at 10.30 and arrived about 12. Fritz strafed junction of our road and got 3 horses and a limber and things unpleasant before we arrived. I loaded here two wagons of rails and took them to new part of job beyond wood and on right of our road along old road. Work on top of hill and I considered it foolhardy. Heavies falling all round us and at length chased us into an old german trench. On left of Glencorse road on hill a battery was bombarded where prisoners were working corduroying and several wounded.</p>
