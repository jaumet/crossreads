  
 25 April 1918 Thursday (X to X crossed out) Turks fire each night on our patrols & drop a few shells about but nothing serious-   Planes come over but drop no bombs lately. Temperature about 114 Fahrenheit.  We are 1300 feet  below  sea level so no wonder HOT. X 3 letters from Laura & 4 Papers she is very good in writing each week & I hear from the wife every 2nd day but letters come in Bunches sent from Nowell Forth he is well.X
