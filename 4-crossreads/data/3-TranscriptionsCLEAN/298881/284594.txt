I am billeted with two of "A" Company officers in a very nice house.  The French people here are very kind and do all they can to make us comfortable.  The Town of Warloy is a rather big and important place.  We are fortunate in being billeted in such a convenient place.  Plenty of shops for the boys to buy what they require.
Warloy 18/6/17Went to Amiens on 16th with Lieut. Gollan (who was our Adjutant but has now been given a staff position).  We had a good fly round in there.  Had some difficulty getting in as we were off
