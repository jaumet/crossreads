back.  I got a very good pass at the school, 85 %, so I did not do too bad.  When we are in the line we get plenty of good food but there is very little variety.  We also get plenty of cigarettes & matches, but we miss a great deal the home comforts.  We had a bath on Monday.  It was the first I had for about 6 weeks.  When we got out of the line you should have seen us, mud & dirt everywhere, and I can tell you I was very glad of the opportunity to have a good wash and a shave.  We have had a lot of sports this week, Football, cricket, races & games of all kinds.  But I would very much like to be home, and live like a decent human being.  I am writing this at 7.30 and it is quite light.  Tell Mary I have written her by the same mail.  Will close now with best wishes.
Yours sincerelyGeo Fitzpatrick
