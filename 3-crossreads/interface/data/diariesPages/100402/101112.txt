Wednesday 31 July
A chap told us that he had it from Brigade that the Division is to be relieved on Friday. To-night Perkins told us that the Division is to be relieved in a day or so we carry on here until to-morrow. Sudden!! We are going well back but me thinks to join the other Divisions on the Somme. Only four gas patients from all yesterday's hostile shells.
