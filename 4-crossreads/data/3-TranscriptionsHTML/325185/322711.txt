<p>we have had a few causalities since coming here. The snipers are pretty good one cant keep their head up too long. We M.G.s are split up in gun sections draw our rations seperate &amp;amp: cook for ourselves we live very well some days then there are times well we have nothing but we are happy &amp;amp: that is the main thing. Rabbit shooting will be very tame after this if I pull through.<br/>The farmers are still living in his houses right up to within a mile of the firing line. They  are within the artillery range &amp;amp: occasionally a shell catches their houses. Today is the anniversary of Anxac day the landing at Gallipoli. We have all been given a piece of cake tin of cocoa &amp;amp: tin of fruit I can see a very swell supper tonight.Well Father  I could write a few pages to you but am not allowed so shall have to close. Love to all from your sincere son Clyde<br/>N.B.<br/>Tell Miss Smith I will write her as soon as I can get some envelopes Clyde</p>
