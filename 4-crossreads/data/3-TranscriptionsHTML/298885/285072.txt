<p>Tues June 6th &ndash; 16<br/>Alex and myself sent to O.P all day and put in a very miserable day with a strong cold wind and rain and also a little "ironmongery" from "Fritz".</p>
<p>Wed June 8th &ndash; 16<br/>Alex and myself arrived OP 6AM.  All quite till 4 PM when the enemy began shelling O.P. After waiting till the third shell hit the building, we vanished for awhile, but they must have kept a close watch on the place for as soon as we returned he started again and did not stop till the whole building was down.</p>
