<p>Dear Miss King</p>
<p>Just a few lines to let you see I have not forgotten you. I wrote to you from Colombo so I hope you received it all right: I have been over here now five months and am getting very fat and am having a good time only I wish this business was over. There is not much use wishing is there Miss King, so the only thing for it is to stick it until we are victorious, and I think they are all anxious to see it through.<br/>It has been very cold over here. I can assure you your mittens and balaclava kept me very warm and am keeping them in good order for next winter. I felt it cold most at Imbros but now that we are back in Egypt from the Dardanelles it is not so bad.<br/>There don't seem to be any prospects of the war being over this year Miss King but let us hope that it wont be much longer. I am sending you a photograph of myself and a little monkey that was given me at Tel-el-Kebir.<br/>I see where the Red Cross is doing great work in Australia and am sure the soldiers welcome their gifts I had a Red Cross shirt and a few other little things given me here and they were very acceptable.  As news is scarce will close with kind regards from<br/>Would like to hear from you soon<br/>Private R. Otto.</p>
