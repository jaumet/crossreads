<p>23 July 1916<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>All day the battle raged with furious intensity. Artillery on both sides shrieked &amp; roared. High explosives &amp; shrapnel. Not a yard of ground that was not torn &amp; rent. Hairbreadth escapes were our portion every hour! The words of that grand hymn, Jesus lover of my soul. continually was thro' my mind --- "Other refuge have I none hangs my helpless soul on Thee", Cover my defenceless head with the shadow of Thy wing. A  merciful Providence protected me from all harm.<br/>Incident on our journey to 4th Batt. Stretcher bearers &amp; patient, whiz-bang &amp; concussion pitched me headlong into dugout on top of dead German [indecipherable] return &ndash; another explosion, duck, piece just  misses my head &amp; buries itself into the earth instead of my back. Lost watch</p>
