 Block E Ward 1 21.6.1915 St Andrews Hospital Dear Mother, Since we left Egypt we have been helping to remind Turkey that there is a place called Australia.  They do not like us, although we do not eat our prisoners as the Germans led them to believe.  If you could see our position you would feel astounded that the first of our troops to land ever took it &ndash; it is a day's work to get up the hills carrying nothing  &amp; with roads made &ndash; yet they did it in the face of rifle, machine gun   &amp; shell fire not to mention obstacles such as barbed wire etc
