Since we have known definitely that we are really leaving Egypt I have had quite a little ache - Yes.  I'm truly sorry to say good-bye to all the interesting things here.  On the whole it has been a happy free time.  We'll miss the beautiful Nile.  For some weeks now the water has been flowing down from Abbysian hills somewhere away in Africa & it is in full flood and such a sight to see from the Pyramid.  There is quite another river up there with feluccas & boats sailing on it.  It seems strange to think all this water has come here after a long (M record) hot summer & without a sprinkle of rain.  Then we'll miss the Niggers too with their fascinating ways & picturesque dress & colours.  The veiled women - The fine Egyptian Menfolk in their red Tarbouches & their charming courteous manner - The persistent street sellers.  The gay funerals & weddings which one never fails to see if you go into Cairo.  The domes & Minarets & Tombs & to say nothing of the pleasure the donks gave us.  Then there's my little garden coming on so nicely with sweet peas - mignonette and pansies &c and the seeds coming from Aus just made me love it.  But its farewell
