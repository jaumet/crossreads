but rocks & more rocks. The main road to Castro proved to be a very fair one, being now kept in repair by the military.Friday 26th. Mess orderly. Weather cold Saturday 27th, Long march in morning which took me all my time to do as I had a bilious attack  & a sore foot. This is my second attack since coming to this country & I thought I had lost them for good. These attacks make me feel wild & snappy with everybody. Very cold with a little rain. Nothing doing during the afternoon.Sunday 28th. Bitterly cold & bleak day. Strong wind blowing with sleet and soft snow falling. Physical drill before breakfast as usual & Church Parade at 11 o'clock. After dinner I decided to walk to No 2 in order to get my mail away. Six miles through a strong wind & driving sleet. I managed to get a pair of mittens & bed socks whilst there. I arrived back at 5.30 several saying they would not have done the trip for a pound. It was not a pleasure jaunt with me but done to get the mail away.
