4/5/17   L?Homme Mort
12.30 am Fighting continues but no reports reach here. General Steele still at his advanced headquarters at Ecoust. Turned in and slept in a bivvy until morning.
9 am There was not much strafe at dawn and all divisions must be taking time to repair their losses. The 22nd Bde. this morning are back in front of Bullecourt some elements in the Hun front trench some in an old trench in front of that. The battle so far is entirely in favour of Germans and the British have received a towelling up that will leave them very short of men. The 1st Bde appears to have relieved the 6th . General Steele 22nd Bde came back here to L?homme Mort. A very fine warm day and a few such will make the place stink awfully with so many dead about. This Bullecourt stunt seems to be one of the toughest things struck up to date. Hun losses must be light compared with ours. Two m.g.s in Bullecourt with their two small crews seem to have wiped out hundreds hundreds of our men
