<p>frozen hard.<br/>On Tuesday [indecipherable] I took a walk over on to the Wycheats Ridge from which the Bosche was pushed in the Messines battle. There are some enormous craters where the mines exploded one of them is over 100 yds in diameter &amp; quite 80 ft deep.<br/>When I returned I found that my successor Rev Pittendrigh had arrived<br/>I spent next day with Bde. &amp; Pittendrigh &amp; I went for a long walk.<br/>My Movement order came that night from Division</p>
<p>Thursday 21st<br/>I left by a Motor Lorry this morning The nearest railway station It could drop me at was Poperhinge There</p>
