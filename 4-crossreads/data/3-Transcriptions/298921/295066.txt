<p>April, 1915<br/>Saturday 3<br/>Easy day today, but off duty with Tonsilitis.<br/>I am anxious to know if you have received any of this Diary, no acknowledgement so far &amp; I would not post if I thought never to reach you. My French is improving &amp; I can manage the garcons &amp; waiters easily now. Am enclosing Charles letter from Ypres.</p>
