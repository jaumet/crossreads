<p>Friday 5 September 1919<br/>Had a bad night. Very few people had a good one here. Boat rolled &amp; tossed about all night. Very big seas. Two big wash places for the men were absolutely wrecked &amp; washed overboard. One officers cabin got washed out &amp; two or three decks (mens) had 2 &amp; 3 feet of water in them. The men had a bad time. Still a bog sea on today. Very cold all day. Had plenty of rain &amp; hail. Won 10/- in a sweep. Slept nearly all the afternoon.</p>
<p>Saturday 6 September 1919<br/>Saw the sun for a while today. Not so cold &amp; windy. Had a bad cut today &amp; got my tooth fixed up once more. Read all day again. My eyes are aching a bit.</p>
