My dear Mother
Just have a moment to let you know that I have arrived here. Had a tip-top trip down & fine weather all the way in. This was prize luck - as chaps who have been here ten weeks state that this is the first fine week they have had. The country all the way down (that is the part I saw) looked fine, but on crossing the border a big difference showed. Vic. is a land of swamps, scrub, stunted, half drowned wheat, bleak hills & distant snow peaks. The latter, by the way, are a big set off to the otherwise poor scenery but do not tend towards warmth. A balmy breeze is now blowing & the frost is not far away from the ink-well. As for the camp - words fail me to express my own opinion which coincides with that of every other man here.
