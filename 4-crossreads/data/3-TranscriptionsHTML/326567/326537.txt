<p>Meantime Fritz went behind a cloud &amp; our Boys after him &amp; they were out of sight but only for a while, when Fritz came down &amp; set fire to the balloon, with our boys in close persuit, one of our Machines got under Fritz &amp; the other on top &amp; they closed in on him, they were all using their Machine Guns, eventually our boys hit Fritz in a fatal spot &amp; down came his Machine head first &amp; I was told by one of our Guards that the Machine buried itself in a field six feet deep, he helped to pull the Dead German out of the Wreckage &amp; took his skull Cap as a sovenier of the Fight. An Officer who was there remarked to the Guard that he was sorry that the German was killed as he certainly put up a great fight against our two machines &amp; he was a brave man as he had a good chance to clear out in the clouds but he was determined to get the balloon at all cost which lost him his life. As the Front line is further away now we only hear the Guns</p>
