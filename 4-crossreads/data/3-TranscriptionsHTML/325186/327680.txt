<p>I felt glad to get out to sea again &amp; get the heat &amp; the smell of the natives away.  We had canvas awnings over the decks as protection from the heat &amp; about the second day after leaving Colombo we struck some boisterous weather &amp; the awnings had to be taken down   Everything was fixed up for rough weather but we escaped it &amp; for the next few days it was squally &amp; showery<br/>On Wednesday 31st May we noticed shoals of porpoises &amp; a very big shark followed the ship nearly all day. As we neared land again we began to feel the heat again &amp; we entered the Red Sea on Saturday 3rd June   We passed the port <u>Perim</u> &amp; there was a warship at anchor there</p>
