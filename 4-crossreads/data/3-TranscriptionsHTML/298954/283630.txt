<p>1918<br/>Sun. 14th Apl. (cont.)<br/>Noticeable were the large numbers of people equipped for walking tours who travelled out of the city by our train, women predominating.   The women wear no hats;  the men usually affect "velours" with feather tufts.   All invariably carry large rucksacks.   We are now skirting the edge of the Hartz Mountains &ndash; fine country.</p>
<p>Pretty river valleys, farms backed by pine plantations, &amp; fir-capped hills gave place late in the afternoon to ugly, depressing scenery, the fields being broken by large ore mines (iron, apparently.)   At the stations we were of great interest to the villagers promenading the railway station in "Sunday" attire.   Arriving at Gusten at 7 pm we marched through the village to a Militar Depot where we got bowls of macaroni soup.</p>
