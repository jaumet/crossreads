<p>14 June, Saturday</p>
<p>F.<br/>We crossed the line last night or early this morning. I go on Boat deck with Jack for afternoon tea. I see a shark &amp; lots of flying fish. I try to do some book-keeping but all the mob on the arell[?] deck singing the songs shown on the screen put me off altogether. So I read instead.</p>

<p>15 June, Sunday</p>
<p>F.<br/>Lovely day. Church parade &amp; we sit on balcony. Hear story of 2 frogs in a bucket of milk. Comforts issued. Socks, Treacle, Biscuits, Cigs etc. watch rather pretty sunset. I am all dressed up &amp; nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Very cool day, strong head wind &amp; a little swell. Sleep up aloft.</p>
