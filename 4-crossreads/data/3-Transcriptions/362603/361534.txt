<p>2.  lost at Sea.<br/>I received a Birthday Card from Mum.  It was a Picture shewing My Little Grey Home in the West. I do not care how soon I am to set out for it.  Although England &amp; the English are glorious, still it is not our own Home.  Give Our Regards to Sylvia Bowden.  Wish Her a Happy X'mas &amp; a Brighter New Year from Ellis &amp; I.  I am still a Corporal &amp; likely to remain so for ever unless I come down.  Norman Upton who I worked with at the Factory is over at Lark Hill D.V.  He is coming over to see me on Sunday.  We have had almost perfect weather for the last 10 days or so.  But, to-night it is blowing very cold.  I am on Duty till about 11.30 pm so I'll get the full benefit of it.  Ellis is away on Duty   He will not return until to-morrow night.  I went to Salisbury again yesterday.  We went on the River in the afternoon.  At one time we did not set out to go for a row until 7.30 pm.  Now it is pitch dark at 7 pm &amp; only October.  I read bits about the Strike   It must have been awful.  Worse than anything I ever experienced.  What was the outcome of the whole affair?<br/>I read of your accident with concern.  I hope that the injury does not leave You with the Screws in another place.  It is bad enough goodness knows in the Hands &amp; feet.<br/>Well, Dad I have no news to give</p>
