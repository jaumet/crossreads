As we were in the support trenches we had to stand too at daybreak but on account of us working all night we used to sleep during the day time or try to & one morning our officer came round a daybreak & told me to see that all the men were in their places, which I did & as our little shelters were holes driven into the banks & covered over with waterproof sheets, but one chap had left his long rubber boots Hanging out of his dugout & from outside the trench it looked as if someone was lying down & just his boots showing beneath the sheet, so when the officer saw the boots he started to swear & told me to take that mans name for not standing to arms, but when I touched the boots & found them empty of anyone he looked hard at me & walked off, a good joke (one on him)
