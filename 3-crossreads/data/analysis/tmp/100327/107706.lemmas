A stoni rough track , the tinkl of sheep bell sound from the valley ? as these bell have differ note the effect is veri music . Poplar and oak and oliv tree ( like our lightwood ) are the main tree , a short green stunt scrub or heather cover the stoni rise . Some of the peak are veri abrupt and lift their barren top up in a wreath of cloud mist . The onli traffic on the track was a few mule load with store , most of the mulet in nativ dress and gave the local greet " sperra !
