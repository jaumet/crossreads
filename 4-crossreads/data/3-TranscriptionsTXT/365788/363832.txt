My dearest Irene,Thank you for your letter of 3 Oct. Yes the Moonstones for my [indecipherable] & thank you for giving Nell S. the necklace.We embarked yesterday on this ship & I expect our destination will be Egypt & perhaps France in the Spring. Could give you some startling news but we have practically been put on our honour not to disclose it.Please address all letters as above, as they never fail to come when addressed thus.Saw Harry Budden 3 or 4 times at Lemnos &
