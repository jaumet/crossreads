Warminster is a fair sized town, having some very good buildings and business paces.  1.45 on parade again, and were taken for another march, we were taken up a back lane and given a few movements and then allowed to sit down for the rest of the afternoon, until it was time to go back to camp.  while we were sitting down an officer told us the reason why we are not allowed to put various things in our letters.  reached camp again 4.30.  went to bed early, had tummy ache all night.</p>
