suppose that I shall ever set eyes on her again & I have only happy memories to think of her with & especially Plymouth.  We soon cleared the breakwater & light house & by now the old ship is rocking like fun & I am beginning to feel squeamish so I will cut this short & go & put my hammock up & get ready to turn in.
5th.  Was wofully sick last night I am still so.  I am forcing myself to eat but it's the job of the world & I don't scarce care a hang what happens but luckily I have some good mates & they are looking after me.  We are just about into the Bay of Biscay & there is a terrible heavy swell running & our old tub is dipping & diving & rolling like an old tub, early this morning the great "Naterland" passed us on her way to Bordeaux.  The weather is very cold & a heavy sea is running I have been wet through several times for I dare not go below for any length of time & there are hundreds more in the same boat.
