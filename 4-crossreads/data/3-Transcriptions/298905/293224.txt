<p>called to your maker"<br/>At last we have caught up to their supply of shells &amp; for every one they send over they get easily 3 in return &amp; not only that, our fellows shell them just whenever they please &amp; always have the last say we have no fear of their artillery now for they get more than they bargain for, plenty of ammunition just suits our wild Colonial gunners they tear it into them night &amp; day.<br/>I am detailed off as the gas N.C.O. &amp; also have a section to-night.<br/>20th. Had a gas alarm last night one of our chap's thought he smelt it, &amp; gave the alarm it went right along the whole of the Army Corp &amp; the villages took it up we could hear the Claxton horns real plain, but it was a false alarm, didn't the boy's swear this is the second alarm we have had since being in these</p>
