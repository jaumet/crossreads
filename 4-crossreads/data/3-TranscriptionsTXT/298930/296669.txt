hut with a bag of potatoes, one of us would ask him to let us see them, and while in the act of examining them, some of the lads would whip a sack over his head from the rear, twist him round and push him out of the door, and by the time he freed himself, the man with the potatoes had disappeared.
Most of the Russians I came in contact with seemed to have a great liking for the English.   I remember just before I left the camp there was a political representative from Russia sent to speak to the Russians in the camp and they were all on parade to be inspected by this person.   He said, "I see you are all looking well."    An old Siberian who was a cripple on crutches stepped forward and said, "Can you say that I am looking well?"   I have been in the Exchange Barrack for months, waiting to be exchanged, and nearly every month I see batches of English, French and Belgians going away, and still I remain."
"Oh," said the political agent, "you are getting better food here than in Russia, it will be better for you to remain here in Germany and work."
The Russians shouted, "You are Deutsche nicht Rusky".
Again the old Siberian spoke, "You say we are well treated here in Germany.   We are treated worse than any other nationality.   Nay, Russland good for Ruskie, Deutschland nicht good.".
I often talked with this poor old Siberian, and asked him what he did in civil life.  He said he was a Capitalist as he had a farm, twelve cows, a wife and eight children.
The Russians were very fond of jokes.   A young man who was with me in the Exchange Barrack was waiting to be sent to the border.
