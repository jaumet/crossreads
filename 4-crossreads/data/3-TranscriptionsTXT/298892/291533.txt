 to the wharf where an immense crowd congregated. We pulled out from the wharf at about 6 a.m. and lay out in mid-stream. Numbers of launches came out and steamed round and round all day until we left. Of course we are under strict Censorship now and I am not allowed to give any information as to our whereabouts but as soon as we reach some definite address I will let you know if possible. In the meantime I am puzzled what address to give  and  but will make inquiries and  add to the foot of this letter. Anyhow, even if it is sometime before you hear from me again you will know I am in the best of health and thoroughly enjoying the trip. Give my love to Aunt Kate and Uncle Vesey. Excuse the scrawl, it is partly the result of a choppy sea and a jumpy head and partly from an extra soft pencil. When I have completely recovered from Mal-de-mer I will endeavour to write you a longer and more presentable epistle. I have not managed to write to the various donors of socks &amp;c. but will endeavour to do so during the remainder of the voyage. Your loving son Eugene.
