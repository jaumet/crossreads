 Dear Dad, A few words to let you know that I am still going strong and have survived the recent battles.  Winter is on us again full strength and the mud is greatly in evidence.  There are rumours that we are going to a quieter front for the winter, which we all earnestly hope is true. 
 Your affect. Son Geo.
