<p>me a lot of good, I have been feeling alright since I returned. I whent to a private doctor down there and the medicene he gave me done me a lot of good. My word the crops must of been very bad their this year.</p>
<p>Yes of course we could not understand why the soldiers voted No but we know here why, but we cannot tell you here why, or our letters would never reach home, but the war will not last forever, then that will be the day and we all wish that it end to-day. There is one thing to be said and that is that the closer we get to the firing line the better time we have, it is only when we are well back that they torture us. Mind you our officers are thorough Gentlemen, it is not their fault.</p>
<p>Well I think that I have told you all the news for this time. No mail should come in from Egypt with out you getting some letters from me. Take every care of yourself. Kind regard to all my friends. Kind regards to the Boss. I will close by sending you my love and best wishes to the both of you. Good Bye for the present</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>Kisses for you<br/>X X X X<br/>X X X X<br/>X X X X</p>
