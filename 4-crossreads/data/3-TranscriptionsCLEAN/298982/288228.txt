Messed about all day until dark Dismounted & waited & then about 9 we started to dig trenches after a feed of bread & cheese & water. It was hard The soil, also d-d dark candles & rags improvised for light. Much remark about the tucker we were expected to dig trenches on. Dig Dig Dig of Dollys. Back to camp 2 am
