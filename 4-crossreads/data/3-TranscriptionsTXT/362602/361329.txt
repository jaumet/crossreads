There's a terrible lot of silly yarns going about.  If any of the crowd ask questions about any of us, just you say my Boys know or say nothing.  Tommy Adams left our Unit &amp; is now probably in France.  I have not heard from Him since He left the Unit.  Jennie is a lovely little woman.  She is not pretty like Marie &amp; has no grand accomplishments.  She is a loving little soul &amp; has a pretty lonely time looking after Her Father &amp; Uncle.  She has a lovely spirit though &amp; gets the best out of life that she can.  Her second Brother has now been called into Camp.  The third Brother was never mentioned.  Is a bit of a rotter I think, that is the eldest Brother.  John the youngest is a fine fellow &amp; a splendid type of the true thorough Englishman.
