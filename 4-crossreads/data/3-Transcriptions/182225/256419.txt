<p>OCTOBER &nbsp; FRIDAY 27 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Raining &amp; blowing like anything; &amp; altogether a miserable day. Cleaning harness all day. We got some new horses in in the evening. Went to the pictures in the evening &amp; they were&nbsp;as good&nbsp;as I have seen here. I was granted leave (4 days) in morning &amp; orders came out at night that it was cancelled; oh Lord it would drive you mad the way the authorities fool you about here.</p>
