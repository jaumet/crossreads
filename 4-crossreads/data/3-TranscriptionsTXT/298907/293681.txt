Oh how I fain would be today"Australia" with thee
The cattle I see grazingIn the fields of verdant greenAcross the plain my dear old homeThe fairest to be seenMy dear sweet faced old mother,And the dear grey haired old dad,Are waiting in AustraliaTo welcome home their lad.
My countree how I miss theeWhen I'm in strange lands aloneMy heart will ever be with theeMy countree & my homeMy eyes they oft are dim with tearsMy heart is full of painFor Australia & the homefolkI ne'er might see again.
