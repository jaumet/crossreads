  
 I do hope & trust that my letters to you have not conveyed such an impression.  Correspondence of this nature must always be personal & privileged, & I do hope that my letters, though they cannot reduce your loss & grief may have , perhaps, given some little comfort to you. With kindest regards Believe me, Yours very sincerely W.L.H. Burgess Bg. Gen.
