<p>camped in another delightful wood apart from the Collecting Station. Every one soon got to work building shanties, &amp; it was not very long  before I had another comfortable home built. My companions this time are Ptes. Whittaker &amp; Steer. The former only joined the unit up again a few days ago. You will notice in the 9th.  edition where he was sent away last October suffering from gas poisoning.</p>
<p>A new scheme on this time, we will help some tunnelling section to build some dugouts.  When we return, we will all certainly be "jack of all trades".</p>
<p>17th. June, 1918. &ndash; 20th. June.<br/>A. section's turn to give a hand at the digging game. We ill work in 8 hour shifts &amp; the squad I was in were very fortunate in drawing first shift. We go on duty at 4 p.m. &amp; finish at 12 p.m.  The work was a little strenuous while it lasted.  On the 20th. instant, we proceeded to the job again, this time on the second shift 12 p.m. to 8 a.m. Fortunately the job was finished in 48 hours so we were not obliged to go out again.</p>
<p>Our long stay at this place was a delightful one, practically all the time we had good weather. Our camp is in a pretty little wood, which resembles some nook at Katoomba. The country surrounding our camp is looking at its best. As far as the eye can see are magnificent fields, &amp; the different coloring caused by patches of poppies &amp; buttercups dotted here &amp; there, add a pleasant effect to the scene. Another advantage in regards to our present qrtrs, is that we are living out in the open</p>
