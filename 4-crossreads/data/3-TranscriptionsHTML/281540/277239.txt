<p>27/10/15<br/>Moonlight at stand to arms.  Woke Doctor at 0600 and went for swim &ndash; used coal barge swept clean by heavy seas.  Water good but very rough and swimming difficult, hard to get out without being bumped.  Fatigue of Indians working on new terrace for stores &ndash; sleeping soldiers huddled up anywhere tired out.<br/>Came back via new road.  Very close morning and somehow the weather today seems to have made me  dreadfully irritable.  The staff are getting hell roused out them.  Will go &amp; walk it off;</p>
<p>Bursting shells very close big splinters blowing back after burst and thudding into bank  0950.  75's skimming within inches of roof and bursting down gully.  Parties hard at work removing miners spoils &ndash; 1500 bags a day.  A light Horse trooper attained record in sniping  Got his 199th Turk yesterday, every hit carefully recorded and verified by independent observer, often an officer</p>
<p>Severe bombardment this morning on sea &amp; land, everyone lying low  2 men killed 3 wounded by a shell from Asiatic Annie over the Asiaside of the straits.  A fine sunny day but a heavy sea on roaring in with foam flecked waves a beautiful sight.  Body unearthed in parapets by shelling</p>
