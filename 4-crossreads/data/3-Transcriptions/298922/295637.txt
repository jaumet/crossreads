<p>Tuesday 4 December 1917</p>
<p>Last night at dinner we bumped into something &amp; everyone stood up &ndash; it may have been wreckage. This morning at 4 a.m. we got S.O.S. again from a boat in our rear, which had been torpedoed but we seem to be protected too well by our escort. It is moonlight at 4 a.m. Only about 4&percnt; of sinkings occur in the dark. Calmer &amp; warmer. <strike>I've written Laura &amp; a few others</strike> but no use posting to you till we arrive Egypt, <strike>will post others Malta</strike>.</p>
