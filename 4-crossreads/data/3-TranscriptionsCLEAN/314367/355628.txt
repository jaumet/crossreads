  
 The seining & outing has done me a lot of good & Richard is his self once & again & played a fair game of bridge last eveng & smoked cigarettes & drank - Lemon squash & soda - By the way Lemon squash is in bottles 1/8 each (about). We pour a lot & fill up with soda & its good, cheap & quite the sound drink - never exceed in alcohol - if you feel anyway heady - the signal is - Stand by - The censoring of letters is going on - I've written a nice little account of "An outbreak of Ptomaine poisoning on a man of war" but its publication will be delayed because I read it over to Fgd & he said - Better wait - 'There is a little criticism in it & the naval board might have a pang' - Its all right but it must wait - We go out at 6 pm & all is in readiness - I'll wind up with a Bluejacket's wit when the storm opened up yesterday - "Quartermaster - send a couple of hands aloft & have that noise stopped"
