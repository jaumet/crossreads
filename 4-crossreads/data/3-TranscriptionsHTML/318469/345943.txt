<p>27th<br/>Still the attack does not come.  The enemy is firing a good many shells &amp; bombs a scattered area evidently hoping to cause a demoralising effect but not doing much damage.  Work Sap, etc. going as usual.</p>
<p>28th<br/>Work going on well in tunnels toward Enemys lines.  Fairly heavy Artillery fire no great damage done to our trenches.</p>
<p>29th<br/>Nothing fresh doing today.  Usual exchange bombs, shells, bullets &amp; other missiles.</p>
<p>30th<br/>Same as yesterday.</p>
<p>31st<br/>About 9 p.m. heavy fire broke out all along our line &amp; our boys made &amp; attack on the right.  11th Battln attacking.  They succeeded in capturing about 200 yds enemy's trenches &amp; holding them about 50 yds in advance of our lines.  Three mines were exploded by 2nd F. Coy before attack &amp; four failed to explode.  Casualties on our side about 10 killed &amp; 30 wounded.  We shelled enemy position all night a monitor &amp; a Destroyer taking part &amp; doing good work.  Officers in Charge where attack was made say that Enemy's Artillery fire on our position was magnificent.</p>
<p>1st.8.15<br/>Not much shelling today our guns doing most of what was done.  Early in the morning a German "Taube" flew over &amp; dropped 3 bombs but without much effect but one of 1st F Coy was wounded in the arm (Sap Hartridge)</p>
<p>2nd<br/>11th Battln still holding position taken from Enemy.  Not much doing today except that enemy dropped a great many large bombs during the afternoon &amp; a good many large shells from a direction not used</p>
