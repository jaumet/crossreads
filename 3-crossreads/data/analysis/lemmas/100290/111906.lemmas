 1916 May 25 Thursday Light rain this morn break up parad . Do noth much all morn . Fatigu work in aft . Toni fall into creek . Joy unbound . After tea write to Miss Barbara send postcard to Cis . Also wrote to Edie Watt . Take our usual stroll round beach . Weather somewhat cold . Sergt . Barr read us extract from an offic at the Front to his peopl . Veri fine literatur full of human feel . Barr a good reader .
