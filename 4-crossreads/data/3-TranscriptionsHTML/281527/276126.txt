<p>to lunch. After this walked down to the 22nd and saw Matthews &amp; then put in the afternoon with the French family at the billet. Found the elder M'selle &ndash; a girl of 19 &ndash; quite passable to talk to. Very nice dimples. Mere &amp; Pere also came in later on and we drank caf&eacute;, cognac and  Geneve (gin) &ndash; the two latter out of tiny glasses. Talked nonsense in pigeon French. The son 25 MM&amp;  C Guevre speaks English well having learned for 5 years at St Omer. Returned to BdeHqs in time for Mess. Franz Albrechts the Belg. interpreter is a studious youth of 19 and will be a fat old Fritz at forty. Our talk after mess turned on ghastly wounds and was rather gruesome &ndash; the things we discuss would chill one.</p>
