Each member of our Unit, has been given a circular re - the Referendum Question.   The arguments for & against are very good, I was inclining towards voting no, but just before Polling Day, I was convinced that I was wrong & voted in the affirmative.  On the 28th inst. I went for a spin in Esbert's Smith car, to a small village, & enjoyed a fine meal there.   These little trips are very enjoyable & helps to break the monotony.   We travelled down the road, that I walked along 15 months ago.
On the 29th November, Eric & I were surprised to see our worthy cobber, Oscar, walk into the Orderly Room.   I was naturally very pleased to see him, as it was over two years since I saw him last.  He is looking remarkably well, military life agrees with him evidently.  Today I applied for special Leave to Paris, & on the 4th December, to my great surprise & pleasure, the application returned, recommended & with the pass attached.  Eric & Esbert are accompanying me, to the gay city.   Naturally we are in an ecstacy of delight as on the morrow we start on our journey.   (The follow on with the letter).
