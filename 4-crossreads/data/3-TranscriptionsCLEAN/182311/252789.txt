   So much for Longford Castle which provided a very pleasant afternoon's enjoyment for Captains Lansell and Trebilcock, and Lieuts.Hughie McColl and myself.
   Back to Salisbury, dinner at the Old George Inn and on the 8 o'clock bus to Amesbury (8 miles) then a two mile walk back to camp.
   Did I tell you that the third Division expect to move to France early in November, it is now an established fact and we wind up our days on Salisbury Plain with a twelve day programme of specialist training and on Saturday start four days final leave.
   My final leave this time will be busy, I'm thinking of going to Hastings to see Battle Abbey and the site of King Harold's Battle in 1066, and have some business too in London and do not think that I can go to Plymouth to see relatives thistime.
   Love to all,
       Harold.
