<p>head and was trying to reconnoitre but those planes of ours have been sailing around all afternoon and the Taube came right into a hornets nest for no sooner had he appeared in sight than our machines set after him he did not wait but turned tail and flew &ndash; literally flew &ndash; with one of our machines in hot pursuit followed immediately by 2 more flying some distance behind. Our man got <strike>got</strike>  on the flank of the Taube and headed him off and emptied a few shots at him which apparently missed for the Taube flew away in a North Easterly direction making for some great banks of white clouds eventually disappearing.<br/> We have now got the Australian Flying Corps on the job and not as formerly when a Taube could come along of his own sweet will and stay as long as he liked. When a Taube is sighted now the procedure is for one plain to mount straightaway and make for him and the other planes also mount and go on either flank at full flying speed hoping by this means to cut him off or he may turn from the pursuing plane and turn into either one of them. So the Taube now has to look out for himself and literally speaking his job now is not plain sailing. <u>3pm</u> up to now about 5 of our planes have returned and we only saw about 2 go out!</p>
