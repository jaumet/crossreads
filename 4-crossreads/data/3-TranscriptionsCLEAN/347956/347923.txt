oclock (noon)  After dinner we took our horses to the sick lines & had them clipped.  a gang of "niggers are on to clip them (about 20 or 30 of them) & they are "quick & dirty" knocking the hair off them, one nigger clips a horse in about an hour, Idleboy objected to the niggers more than he did to the clippers, & this afternoon it rained for a wonder & we had a very nice fall there must have been 10 points altogether;  Stan dealt his horse away for a mare of Major Granvilles, I believe "Cob" is to be used as a pack horse & he is a good horse
