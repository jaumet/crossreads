<p>over the roads so I waited in an old house &amp; finally pushed on &amp; got through.<br/>It is very quiet so far tonight.  I hope we can get a good nights rest.<br/>Got a budget of letters yesterday, one from Home.</p>
<p>Saturday 3 March 17<br/>This morning I went to Canteen &amp; after lunch left Houplines for Armentiers.  My kit came up &amp; for another spell I am back in old billets.  Our men came out early in the morning.  The weather has turned very cold again, sharp white frosts &amp; keen winds.</p>
<p>Sunday 4th<br/>Went to Billets for a few minutes, lunched at "au Boef" with Capt. Blake.<br/>The weather has been nice &amp; clear for a couple of days &amp; quite cold.  I had a service at the Y.M.C.A. tonight.  Had a good time.  Three men decided for Christ.</p>
