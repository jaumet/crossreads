<p>Tues. May 22.  Had Break in Bed again.  Got up about 9.  Went to Whitehall &amp;  saw them changing Guard.  Life Guards &amp; the Blues.  Great sight.  Then went on to Buckingham &amp; saw them changing Guard there.  It was wonderful.  The men marched like machines.  We also saw the men coming out after being decorated by the King.  There was a big crowd &amp; as each man came away he was greeted with much applause.   We then met Bunny  &amp; Charley Whitaker.  Visited Westminster Abbey.  Saw the Tombs of Wellington, Nelson &amp; many other famous persons, also saw the Gun carriage on which the Iron Duke's body was conveyed.  It is made of captured French Guns.  Went into a restaurant &amp; had a great feed of Steak &amp; chipped potatoes.  At night we went to see Chu Chin Chow.  It was a great Show.  Oscar Asche &amp; Lilly Brayton are as good as ever.</p>
<p>Wed. May 23  Spent a quiet day wandering around the City, Riding in Taxis &amp; Buses.  The Girl Conductors look very sweet in their neat blue uniforms &amp; hats turned up at the side.  Visited Madame Tussaud's.  It was most interesting.  The wax figures look almost life-like.  Snowy &amp; I wandered into what we thought was a nice restaurant &ndash; but it turned out to be vegetarian.  We tried some nut pie &amp; raspberry pudding &ndash; then we gave it up &amp; went to another place for a feed.  In the afternoon we purchased Post Cards &amp; writing material &amp; went back to the Shaftesbury.  Had an hours sleep, then we spent an hour in the Writing Room.  Sent a few Post Cards &amp; wrote to Lill.  What a wonderful difference it would make if only she were here.  Gee! What a time we'd have.</p>
