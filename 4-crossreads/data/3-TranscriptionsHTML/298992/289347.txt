<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>I was very glad to get your letter today, and hear you were all well. It seems months since I have heard from anyone, and really it is about 7 weeks since I have had a letter.</p>
<p>It surprised me to hear of Dene's joining but I'm glad he has done so because I think anyone who can possibly join should do so now, its no time to be hanging back. And Uncle Jim is going too. My word I would like to be in his regiment; I'll bet he is a very popular Officer with the men. I saw in the Bulletin of Cairns getting his commission.</p>
<p>I am still doing Guard here, but hear that something is going to be done about us, at the end of the week, so perhaps<br/> I may be home for Sunday dinner. We are being fed very well here and though it is cold, I am getting very fit, and quite ready to go back to the front and do<br/> my little bit this time &ndash; and I'll take good care I don't get any more influenza.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Helen today also. Was so glad to get it, as I have not had a word</p>
