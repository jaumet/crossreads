1-1-17Mon 1stSmall Pox has broken out in El Arish & the villages are all "out of bounds" to all ranks; The sun came out bright this morning for a change but it did not last long as the clouds banked up after dinner & a very cold wind blowing & rain tonight;  A couple of "Scotty" Officers paid the Regt a visit today to see some of our Officers & they say the 42nd Division is leaving El Arish tonight for Rafa, we hope they have a pleasant trip but are not anxious to accompany them;  A rum issue was given out today the first since we left Gallipoli; Put in today writing letters; A/Sgt Hill who has relieved me of a good deal of work, is being sent to A Sqdn tomorrow as L/Cpl
