<p>March 1917<br/>28th.   This morning I left Beaulencourt about 7.30 according to orders received last night &amp; proceeded to Villers-Au-Flos, a few miles ahead where I met a guide from No.3 Section, who moved over there a couple of days ago, &amp; with him, went around the village to find a suitable place to billet our section (No. 4)   I found a suitable place in the shape of an old cellar (nearly all the cellars in the village have been destroyed by Fritz) &amp; the section moved into the village about 10.30 a.m.   The day was spent in fixing up the billet &amp; cleaning half a house out of a stable for the horses.   I have taken up quarters with Cpl Moore in another, but smaller cellar opposite.</p>
