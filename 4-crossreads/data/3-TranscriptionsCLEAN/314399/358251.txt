 Friday 12 September 1919 Very sleepy today. Still icy cold. Old boat starting to roll again. No fights at all today from pulling out an account of a decision by the referee yesterday. He disqualified a man for ear biting & some of them seem to think he was wrong. He wasn't tho. Quite a lot of wireless messages for the boys from their people. Am not going to send any home. Did some more patching & rethreaded the beads for one of the kids.
