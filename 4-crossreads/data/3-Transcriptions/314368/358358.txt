<p>photo taken before going back this time. I had a few post cards taken a few weeks ago but have heard nothing of them yet although they may be waiting for me at the battalion. I will be glad to get my letters as it is now some time since I have had any home news. The news of late in the papers has been most encouraging and every day brings a fresh advance and a new victory for us. Now that the winter is nearly over, every day sees our worst hardships disappearing for although we have a severe winter here France in spring time is very mild. I hope that all is still going on well at home and that the orchard is doing well with all the wet weather. I sincerely hope that poor old Aub is getting well again, I should like to get a letter from him as soon as he is well enough to write.<br/>Trusting this will reach you safely and find you all in the best of health.<br/>With fondest love to all<br/>Your loving son<br/>Gordon</p>
