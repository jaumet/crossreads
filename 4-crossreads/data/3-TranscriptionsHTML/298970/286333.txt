<p>15th July (Saturday)</p>
<p>More guns arriving.  The wounded who came in today were a grim sight &ndash; two having died in the Ambulance Motor.</p>
<p>16th July (Sunday)</p>
<p>Two of us were given a job of making the Operating Theatre Gas Proof.  Later in the afternoon we were asked to make two operating tables as fast as we could.  Evidently something is expected.  The arrival of troops and guns seem to suggest it.</p>
<p>17th July (Monday)</p>
<p>Orders this morning stated that an offensive movement had been planned for today but it has been postponed till Wednesday.  It is rather strange that such orders should be circulated when they are generally kept secret.<br/>Aeroplanes were very busy today.</p>
