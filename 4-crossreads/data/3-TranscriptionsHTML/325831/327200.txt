<p>4.<br/>specimen they must be. Not having seen an Australian paper for some months, I can't give you my learned opinion upon the causes, nor yet the best plan of action which should have been adopted for an early settlement. I only know that for a short period kerosene &amp; candles burned merrily.</p>
<p>Your letters were addressed c/o Commercial Banking Co of Sydney, &amp; this seems to be rather a good plan as I can keep them posted with any changes in my address.</p>
<p>Miss Miles tells me that she will shortly be sailing for Australia, so we will not be able to avail ourselves of her kindness much longer.</p>
<p>Our cables seem to be going astray, as I have answered all that I have received from you, &amp; sent one per week. Your last arrived yesterday.</p>
<p>Loving greetings all well.</p>
<p>Give my love to them all.</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
<p>Keith.</p>
