 Notes in Lt Col Crowl&#39;s lectures. 
 A few important points. 
 At one point of the foghting round Gaza in the Infantry &amp; Light Horse attack they sufffered a reverse with 15,000 total casualties. The allied troops have not on any account had a straightforward advance here&nbsp; if  these 2&nbsp; advances  stunts all along have only been made by losses of men in gaining experience first to make &nbsp;second attempt. The site where this camp is was the part of the canal that the Turks attempted to cross at.
