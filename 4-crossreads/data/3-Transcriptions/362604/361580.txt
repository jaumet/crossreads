<p>are lengthening out, it is pretty dark now.  I've a lot of tidying to do to-night.  When I have to write, my room is just tidy enough to pass the C.O.'s inspection.  Now to-night I'll be able to make everything spick &amp; span.  We'll have fried steak &amp; sausages for supper, with cocoa, Tea or Coffee &amp; jam, Long-lick, Cake, Short-bread, Biscuits or Ham &amp; chicken paste with bread &amp; butter if we wish besides lots of other things.  Our cupboard is nearly always full of good things.</p>
<p>Now, Mum, Dad &amp; George I must bustle off or I'll miss Tea &amp; I've got to stay on Duty till 6 p.m. to-night.  Regards to all the Neighbours &amp; poor Mrs. Doyle &amp; remember me to Mrs. Stephen Dobson, Keirle &amp; Bunting.</p>
<p>Best Love to you all<br/>From<br/>Dave, Ellis &amp; Harry</p>
