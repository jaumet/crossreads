August, 1915Saturday 14Letters from Nowell Forth & Lorna -Nowell may be up from the Sudan next month - Harry Phillips came in to see me, he is not so well as when I left got a cold - I have many visitors all want me to tell them a story of the fighting - I can shoot a man but have never used a bayonet yet I like a Revolver for Trench work.
