Arrive in Alexandria at 5.20 a.m. after a rather uncomfortable ride. taken straight on to wharf embarked on S. S. Caledonian. 15.000 Australian troops said to have left Tel-el-Kabir last night embarking all morning. Delta of Nile, low flat land, marshes. Pull out into stream stay there all night. Bunk on deck.
3,000 troops on board. All the Nowra Waratah boys on board. Also our shipmates on S. S. Armadale, the Engineers. Rather strange coincidence.
