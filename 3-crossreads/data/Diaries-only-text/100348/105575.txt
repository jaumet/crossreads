Cold and Wet. Worked on the tram-line from "Tin Barn Dump". Was caught in the open by another bombardment and sought the protection of my friend the ditch again. Did not mind it this time for our guns opened up and gave him beans; which was very comforting. The crossfire of his machine guns was very hot. There were no causualities. The peasants in this part of the world wear big wooden shoes, shaped like pontoons, and because of the amount of rain that falls in this region, I reckon they need them, the mud and slush is a caution, a man could drown in it; and splashing through it makes a man so tired, that I can throw myself down on the stone floors of my billet, and sleep in my saturated clothes like someone dead.
