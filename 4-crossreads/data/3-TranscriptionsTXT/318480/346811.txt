 [Transcriber's note:  Private Frank Hassall enlisted in the A.I.F. on 20 January 1915 at the age of 18.  He was in Gallipoli where he was wounded and then on to England where he was admitted to hospital in Bristol which he mentions in the following letters to his brother Hec.  These three letters are written at this time, the first describing the battle in which he fought at Gallipoli, the second and third his time in England, a visit to London and to friends by the name of Holman in Bristol which he enjoyed immensely.  He returned to Egypt in February 1916 and rejoined his Battalion.  From there he went to France in March and was killed in action on 6 June 1916 in France.  He records show that he was buried at Brewery Orchard Cemetery, Bois Grenier south of Armentieres.]

 Dear Old Hec 
 I was glad to get your nice letter although it was written three months ago.  I suppose I shall be back again at the front by the time you receive this.  I was at Anzac 5 weeks before I was hit.  We landed at Anzac on the 20th of August.  The first 2 weeks we went out on to the left, opposite Anafarta and relieved the 13th Batt.  The Turks trenches there were 200 yards away &amp; you could shoot over the parapet in the day light as long as you did not come up twice in the same place.  There was a big advance on the 27 of Sep.  100 men out of 4 Coy were put in the charge &amp; 63 of them were killed and wounded.  I was with the reserves &frac12; a mile away.  The 13 Batt. were put back in the trenches to keep up covering fire to keep the turks heads down.  There were several other Batts. beside the 17th in the charge.
