 [Wednesday 18 October 1916] 
 Leave by 2.7 pm train for Dolly-   Walsall is a manufacturing town &amp; a black one.  Went to "Peg o' my Heart" at the Globe Theatre, with Dolly, she was quite happy at being left alone. It was very cold coming down in the train but fine. "Peg o' my Heart" is a street thing &amp; we both enjoyed it much all about "Ould Oirland"
