making a list of shortages for the new 2.M. Had a bath during afternoon & read some papers a good afternoons rest. Rumours of us going in again. Latest official figures of yanks stunt is 20,000 prisoners & the British since Sept 1st have taken another 20000 odd, good going. Billy Hughes drove past yesterday & meeting some of our chaps shook hands all round, he is very enthusiastically received. During the day we had some balloons brought down, I saw two but rumour hath it that the number was 3. Splendid mail in from Aussie, 11 letters & a parcel from home, a real treat, a bright moonlight night so expect the loches.Monday16th. Sept.  Practically no huns over strange to say. last night Had a quiet day and did some washing and writing. Rumours of a big stunt coming off in a few days and we are getting ready by dumping stuff so as to travel light. The 8th & the 15th. have also dumped one sections gear in our camp. I believe the main roads are closed each night now for tanks coming up & probably cavalry.
