<p>the affluent frequently looks back on his days of poverty as the happiest.</p>
<p>I remember a friend of mine once saying, that if ever he became wealthy, he would travel around the world. Some time later his father died and left him much money. That fellow hardly went beyond his garden gate so fearful was he lest he should spend money. The fellow was happy when he was poor, always laughing and full of fun. The money turned him into a mean, miserable, contemptible, being. If friends called to see him he imagined they would try to borrow from him. Money, the terrible greed for gold took possession of that chap, with the almost inevitable result, it completely altered his nature. We all boast, that if such or such a thing happened to us we would still be the same, I wonder how many would. I have&nbsp;often noticed, fine fellows of diggers, or N.C.O.&#39;s, who have attained commissioned rank, turn out, rotters. They forget their old comrades, and on the slightest familiarity on the part of the digger, he &quot;throws&quot; his superior rank at him.</p>
<p>What a &nbsp;world it would be if we could arrange everything to our individual advantage. I wonder if we should be happy. No! I suppose not. Some other chap would be bound to fall in love with the girl which you had chosen. Oh no! it would never work. So it&#39;s make the best of this poor old planet, and endeavour to laugh our worries and troubles away.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always found that laughing is a wonderful asset. I&#39;ve been in a room where the occupants have worn long serious faces, and I&#39;ve left them in shrieks of laughter. It&#39;s a wonderful tonic.</p>

<p><u>DAKIR</u>.</p>
<p>This is a port on the west coast of Africa, and like most foreign ports, dirty, hot, dusty, and decidedly unhealthy looking. We were not allowed to land here. Have a swim in the discolored water. The natives</p>
