1918Fri. 6th SeptThe Feldwebel, a fat Prussian warrant officer. I have written to the Ambassador for Holland demanding to know why we are still in a lager which is not exclusively an officer's lager, and the Feldwebel has called me down to spread soothing syrup all over the landscape.   We are to move ah! so soon, yes! and meanwhile, where do we live?
I told him we lived by ourselves & with a rebuking gesture he ordered us to move to the top barrack, full of Belgian & French officers with a smattering of English (two or three old captains.)
Sat 7th.We move to our new quarters.   Not so bad, & a bit more lively than our old tomb.    The Italian Theatre gave their premiere performance with much eclat this evening.
Waltz songs, operatic choruses etc, quite a change and a huge success.
Sat 28th Sept.The English Co. present "An Awful Story" a musical cannibal-island absurdity (and well named, too!) with a rotten supporting bill.
Charlie Hampson has weakly allowed two or three "duds" to continue on who can no longer sing & Dennelt, Jones, were awful failures tonight.   Smith & Bonnelt gave a "soubrette & partner" turn which was excellent but the show generally was a failure.
