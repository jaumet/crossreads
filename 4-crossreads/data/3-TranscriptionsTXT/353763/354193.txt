The gold mining on Woodlark island &amp; the main land of N Guinea is all alluvial  -  Not a single quartz reef has been found on N.G.  -  However N.G.  is not yet fully known &ndash; mining is a pure gamble  -  You get niggers  -  Pay them 6&pound; per annum  -  Feed them &amp; they do as you say  -  Your claim under a miners right is 100 x 50  yards  I take it  -  This doesn't seem to me very much  -  A plantation of coco nuts pays well but you want 5-7 years before its in full going order  -  It seems this is valuable property &amp; very very hard to buy  -  100 acres will return anything up to 800&pound; per annum  -
