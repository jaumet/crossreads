Thursday - Left Codford for Lyndhurst to attend Bombing School there (Southern Command Bombing School) for one day (Friday) to pick up anything new. Trained through to Southampton where Jackson & I spent a few hours wandering the streets. We were not allowed into the Docks & had too little time to seek a pass for admittance. Trammed out to suburb of Shirley. Southampton seems a very tidy city for a port. The trams are large double deckers. I bought a few little ornaments for souvenirs.
We reached Lyndhurst Road Station at 5pm & took large motor bus 3 miles to Lyndhurst, passing through some of the New Forest. Reported at the School at 5.30, were received well & asked to afternoon tea by the C.O. Major -.  After this we walked to the town & took rooms at the "Stag", Jackson & I sharing a large old fashioned bedroom (No.4) containing 3 large double beds. Jackson & I then went for a walk but rain turned us back. I hired a bike for 2 hours and rode through the New Forest, visiting Rufus Stone and Sir Walter Tyrell Hotel nearby.
