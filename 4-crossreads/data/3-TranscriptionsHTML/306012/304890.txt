<p>Sund. 5th May<br/>On Friday the weather suddenly changed and we had a hot sunny day.  Yesterday and to-day have both been mild with a few showers of rain.  The trees and shrubs are rapidly bursting forth into leaf and I think summer has come to stay.  The change in the countryside is remarkable &ndash; everything is beginning to look so pretty &amp; green.  Fritz hasn't done much damage about here yet.  He put a few shells into Daours last night.  Sooner or later I think he will shell us out of the place.<br/>We have put through a lot of cases lately &ndash; from noon 23rd April to noon 28th (5 days) no less than 1629 sick, gassed &amp; wounded.</p>
