  
 B Squadron 1st Regiment ALH 
 22nd September 1916 
 My dear Mother I have just got back from forty eight hours leave into Port Said - John Cay and I went in together on Wednesday and have had a pretty good time but of course there is nothing much to see there compared with Cairo or Alexandria. As soon as we got in John and I had our boots and leggings cleaned and made ourselves look spick and span, then got a garry and drove round to the Post Offices and asked for Mr Trelawny. I was shown into the Boss there,  and  who was a Frenchman and he was most "desolate" because Mr Trelawny had gone to England for a holiday and would not be back till 23rd October but would I wait and come back then? - I did not see how I could wait so said I might come back again; but we were really dissapointed because John and I thought we were at least good for a dinner if Mr Trelawny had been there; however we met a young lady from Australia working in the Empire Club whom John knew so we talked to her for a while and did not feel so bad. I sent you yesterday a small packet with some coins for the boys and that piastre broach for you, also a "Moses in the Bullrushes" charm and three small trinket affairs - The two smaller copper coins are half malimes and the other copper one is a malime; they are out of circulation here and are rather hard to get so are worth keeping.
