Monday Feb 1-15 -  No mail so far - Swim at 6.30 with Fitz - I am medical guard & Commander D is under my care - Chief act this morning was my having Johnson up before the Captain & the end of J's career - he is to be recommended for "Dismissal from H.M.Service" - I gave him his character in full on the quarter deck & said I regarded him as distinctly harmful to the quiet & efficiency of the medical service of the ship - I also remarked that if a direct lie was of no avail half a dozen statements - mostly false - wd act in the same way - In a way I felt sorry to do this but he's no use to any doctor on a ship & the sooner he was ended the better - By all accounts he was sent to the Fantome so as to be got rid of - you cant get away from your characterhowever - either on sea or land - in fact - the sea & your mess will write your character quicker than anyone else - "Cap on - Right about - "Dismissal from Service" Quick march - Exit Johnson - SBA - Dismiss.
