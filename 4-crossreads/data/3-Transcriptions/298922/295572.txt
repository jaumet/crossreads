<p>Wednesday 19 September 1917</p>
<p>Alex:<br/>Now Friday is given as the day we may get a boat. No boy ever looked forward to his Xmas Holidays as keenly as I do to this journey home. I will post this the day I sail - <strike>it will be 2 weeks from date my leave was granted &ndash; however it is better than the Front line &amp; I'm not a bit keen to return there at present whatever I may be later on.</strike>  My Bronchitis is chronic &amp; I get bad fits of coughing, a dry climate away from the sea is the one that agrees with me.</p>
