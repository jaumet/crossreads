11/8/18FramervilleThe afternoon was quiet and we only had a few shells over. Slept and dozed. Sent Eugene Gorman ahead to reconnoitre our headquarters for tonight and called in all our overcoats in case the boys have to fly the bags. Orders arrived just before dark for us to relieve some of the 19th and some of the 28th. At dark we moved. Stewart & I rode up on horseback & called on the old French line and had a talk to all my company comdrs. It was dark now and some Boche planes were low flying over and dropping bombs which burst with loud crashes. The airman came so low that we could clearly see his plane. As we rode across to the village of Framerville he followed us with bombs and I think caused some losses
