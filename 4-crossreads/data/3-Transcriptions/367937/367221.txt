<p>Ras-el tin<br/>Alexandria</p>
<p>19th July, 1916</p>
<p>Dear Boys<br/>Finish this place; I am off back to the desert to day.<br/>First of all I had better fix up about some photos I am sending you &ndash; The shop made a mistake and did not print me off any coppies as I had ordered so I think when you get them you had better go to the Harrington's and get one of each so that Mother can have can have all the same sort of gas-light photos.  Rostron &amp; I printed of a douzen so that I could tell you what some of the negatives were.  Of the others - the rabbit is a pet one here &ndash; the goats are a mob that stop live just in front of Ras-el-tin here; you can see what the country is like and I cant find out at all what the goats eat &amp; yet they are all fat.  Fat tailed sheep &ndash; they have hair only it is wool like goats &ndash; Hassan is our waiter here &ndash; All the horses here are arabs &ndash; you see little weedy ones pulling tremendous loads, they are all terribly poor and all stallions.  You will be able to make out the rest your self I think.<br/>I am very well equipped for the desert this time; I bought a compass with a luminous dial cost 10/- a wristlet one, a person needs one out there, especially in these sand storms &ndash; also a French dictionary and Tolstoi's "Le Faux Coupon" in French -  I have been reading the french paper here &amp; talking to french people &amp; getting quite good at it so I am going to keep it up &amp; it will be something to do.</p>
