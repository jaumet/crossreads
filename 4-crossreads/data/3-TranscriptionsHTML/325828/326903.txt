<p>France&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 22.7.16<br/>7/6/16</p>
<p>Daddy dear,<br/>You will see by the date on the attached letter that it is 2 months old.  I must explain how this is.  I was writing this letter to you a few days after I landed in France &amp; just put down on paper my thoughts of the country &amp; surroundings.  I had just completed 7 pages of it &amp; was still going strong, thinking of course the censor would pass it when a lieutenant stuck his head inside the tent &amp; said that all letters had to be confined to 2 pages &amp; no more.  I was very disappointed &amp; didn't like tearing it up so I put it away &amp; made a fresh attempt.  Looking</p>
