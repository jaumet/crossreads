27-3-17Tue 27thThe machine gun & Field Amb. Combined played the Regt football this afternoon; it was a great game & resulted in a scoreless draw. The Mounted Troops East of Gaza withdrew today & allowed 9,000 Turkish reinforcements get into Gaza & then closed up again to stop them getting back or so the rumor goes, we have had no official news through & there appears to be more interest taken in football than in the fighting Went down for a dip this morning with several other Sigs. One of our planes was brought down in flames yesterday at Gaza; Two R.F.C. officers were killed
