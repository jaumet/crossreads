<p>My dear Hal &amp; Freddie<br/>I have not received a letter from either of you for an awful long time but dont know whether it is that your letters have not come or that you have forgotten to write in all that excitement you have been having skating etc but I have been hearing tales about you you young shavers!<br/>Suppose by this Aunt Katie is back and has put you in your right places again.<br/>The man who pinched my camera evidently wanted it as he would not bring it back for the 10/- reward so I only have a few old negatives which I will send you first chance but I will often be able to send you photos home as lots of other chaps have cameras and I can often buy photos from them.<br/>I hope you have sent me those views of home you talked about.<br/>There is no news to tell you here and I am writting this in haste as an Australian mail goes soon and I want to write to two or three people including Mother. I received some more papers from home last night (those addressed by Aunt Katie)<br/>Love to Aunt Katie.<br/>I am<br/>Your loving brother<br/>Robert C. Wilson</p>
