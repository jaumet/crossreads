[July 1915]
(7) Usual sniping goes on all night. 13 Bn inlying picquet today. Parsons myself get permission from O.C. to go for a dip, which is very acceptable after so much heat dust. H.M.S Humber bombards Turk Battery out towards "Lone Pine" this afternoon. Turks getting very active on our lefty no doubt preparing for another wild charge. Well let em all come we are quite ready for them. Sending rockets up to night to illuminate the space between enemys trenches our own to guard against Turkish surprise attack.
(8) On the move at 4 this morning for fatigue work on the beach, We had only been down about 20 minutes when over came a shell burst pretty high in the air, but 4 of our boys were wounded. We returned to bivouac about 10 A.M. About midday Turks train their guns on N.Z. Battery again, smashing a wheel of one of them. Of course our dug-outs being in rear of them we often get fragments of shell showers of earth stones. Got pretty quiet again until after 6 o,clock when they got noise,s in the head and they started a lively artillery duel kept going for over an hour finishing up the Chorus with a merry tune on the machine guns. Afterwards quietness reigned supreme.
