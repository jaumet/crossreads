<p>that Katia Battle.  I was unlucky, my regiment had the bad luck too miss it, I would liked too have been in it.  I supose I will see all I want before its over.  I see in the paper where Mr Jack White that was on Kerarbury has been killed in France.  I am very sorry for him as he was such a nice fellow.  The Leutenant that is over my troop he said that he knew you, his name is Mr Gudge Brown, his Father is a doctor in Parramatta.  I think he is a very nice young fellow, I know him pretty well as he went over</p>
