  
 The boys have often said to me when coming from the line He bargained for a minnie & old Fritz's 5.9. But they never dropped a hint to us when asking us to come That the 3rd would be teetotal and we wouldn't get our rum 
 And we need it Yes we need it after lying in the cold And the other divvies get it at least that's what Ive been told So be a pal and scout around & find out what you can, And all your cobbers in the lines will thank you to a man
