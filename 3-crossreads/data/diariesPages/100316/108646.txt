7/5/18 Querrieu
After lunch two companies moved out to a little piece of open ground towards Allonville. This was the most delightful of places. Here we carried out an attack practice on a trench using men with flags to represent tanks. The operation went off quite well. These companies formed up and moved off and the other two then arrived and did the same. Major Dooley took charge of the operation and criticised it at the pow-wow afterwards. I also said a few things. Rode home and at 5 pm went up to Bde HQs. to see a demonstration of rifle grenading. General Phillips the CRA. was there as he and staff are moving into the Chateau too today. After a yarn with the other colonels returned to Mess and found Jack there. He stayed after dinner. By gas shelling Amiens and doing others things Fritz seems to have given signs of carrying out his anticipated attack on tomorrow so we have taken special precautions re the issue of S.H.H. and bombs. It was a splendid fine warm evening and on the front there was a continuous and sustained bombardment. The lurid light of gun flashes flicks over the sky. I think that it is nearly all our shelling as our guns are out to search every hollow and valley where his troops might assemble. We have an officer on duty all tonight.
