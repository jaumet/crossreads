He had his dressing station in front of our front line about 40 yards distant from the enemy & knew pretty well the detail of everything that happened.  From what he told me I haven't the least doubt that Fred Phillips was killed.  Other officers of the battalion wounded at the same time reiterated his story. 
 He had charge of the Lewis guns of 1st Battn. & was thought highly of by his Colonel & the other officers.  At Pozieres he did wonderful work as a stretcher bearer, his strength enabling him to carry when others were worn out with exhaustion & as an officer he fully [indecipherable] all exhaustion. 
 I can only add to the regret
