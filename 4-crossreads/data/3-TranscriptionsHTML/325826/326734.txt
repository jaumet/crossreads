<p>5.  I have started some work this week in connection with the Y.M.C.A., for the soldiers.  To-day &amp; to-morrow it is just franking (is that the way to spell it) letters &amp; doleing out paper &amp; envelopes &amp; such like things in one of the buildings in the Esbekiah Gardens in the centre of the town here.  These Gardens have been given over &amp; devoted wholly to the soldiers &amp; their welfare &amp; are such a god-send.  After to-morrow I shall be doing different work there, canteen work, but I don't know any particulars yet.<br/>There is a Sister Lucy <strike>Olu</strike> Owen staying in this Pension who is voluntarily doing secretarial work for the Y.M.C.A one floor above us &amp; it is through her I am getting this work.  She is a lady of about 38-40, rather to very nice.  She was a voluntary Sister in the Manchester (Methodist) Mission for 10 years &amp; has been ordered to Egypt for her health.  She has been very nice to me though I do not see her a great deal as she is nearly always up in the Y.M. rooms.  Still you will be glad to know that there is somebody English here to whom I can go if I want anything.<br/>Well my very dear ones my time has gone.  My love to Jobber &amp; congratulations on the likelihood of promotion to 2nd year, the dear Child.  I'll hug her to snips when I get hold of her again.<br/>Many thanks for looking after my ferns: the chooks are yours to keep or kill accordingly as they behave themselves.<br/><u>Very very very</u> much love from<br/>Your loving daughter<br/>Olive.</p>
