<p>our very best and hope for all things good</p>
<p>Just at my elbow, is my little Canary, singing away full of joy, the sea, is very calm, and peaceful looking, the white sea gulls are skimming over the water or sitting, patiently waiting on the sea wall, for pieces of bread, which we carry across to them, the sun is shining over the hills showing up, the the white castles and white washed farm building, and our beautiful promenade, but it is not always</p>
