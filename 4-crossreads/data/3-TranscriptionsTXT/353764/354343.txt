Nothing to break the ordinary run of routines.  The Sea has toned down & we are gliding along at a good rate.We are still out of sight of land & I understand we are just entering The Bight.  We have passed Adelaide without calling in.  Passed 2 Steamers en route.
Thursday 25th Nov 15Still out at Sea with no sight of Land.  We are still punching along in the Bight & the roll is very big.  Sighted Whale this morning on Port Bow.  We expect to reach Albany on Saturday Afternoon. Nothing much of interest save that we passed very big liner on the Starboard Side, but could not make out who she was.
Friday 26/11/15Very heavy swell on, which makes one think that the boat will capsize at times.  Imagine Miles & Miles of nothing but gigantic rolls & you can get some idea of what it is like.We are now 300 miles out of Albany, but unfortunately Still in the Bight.  We hope to make Albany by 12 o'clock Saturday.  This is our fourth day without a sight of land.
