<p>There was another gunboat lying behind a headland and just a little further on what appeared to be a pleasure steam yacht something after the style of pictures of the Royal yacht. We have been steaming full speed for some time now as there is a danger about. There is a Turkish fort somewhere along here which has been smashed up but which might do damage and there always gunboats about here waiting. Perim, Hell's Gates or Straits of Babelmandeb are British and guard the entrance to the Red Sea and is not very wide. While passing through we passed a Spanish steamer the Regaypi of Barcelona quite close and I could see the name plainly with the glasses &amp; the notice    <strike>of the</strike> re the propellers.

Passed another gunboat this evening but too far away to notice her at all well. About 11 o'clock we started to pass the group of islands starting with Hamesh. They are very fine, uninhabited and are of volcanic origin and although they have <u>some</u> verdure they are very barren and rise to a great height. They are on the port side, (Left) and towards the end there is some parts of beaches of sand and a wreck of a fairly large boat is plainly visible.. The stern and the hull are above water and the nose buried pointing out to sea and to the left are two masts sticking out of the water and apparently another wreck. Towards the end of this group <strike>are</strike> we pass between the main islands</p>
