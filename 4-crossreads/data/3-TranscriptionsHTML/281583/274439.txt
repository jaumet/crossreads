After the bombardment ceased &amp; while I was being taken to the field dressing station I could not help but notice that there were dozens of poor wounded chaps all round. The total casualties in our unit alone was four killed &amp; 16 wounded. Of the sights of the dead I will not speak as they presented too horrid a sight, But the way the shell hurled men about in the air was terrifying to look upon.</p>
<p>All the time their Aeroplanes rained bombs down which however did no damage &amp; they  were ultimately driven of &amp; lost 3 machines.</p>
<p>After passing through the dressing station I was put into an ambulance, together with others &amp; brought to Grove Town Clearing Station situated near Bray, It is a British Hospital &amp; I appear to be the only Australian here. There is a Manchester man on one side of me a Seaforth Highlander on the other &amp; between them they keep me amused.</p>
