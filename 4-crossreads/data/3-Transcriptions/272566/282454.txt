<p>Thursday 11 January</p>
<p>A pleasant surprise came this morning when Connell &amp; I were informed that we could go to Amiens on leave.  This follows a special request we made to an officer a few days back.  We travelled in by Motor Ambulance and arrived there when snow was falling pretty heavily.  Had dinner at the Hotel Modern, looked through the wonderful Cathedral and walked all round the city.  For a matter of curiosity we had a ride on the queer trams.  Sent post card views of the city home.  Amiens is a beautiful city and the trip proved rather a fine outting except that it was a bit short.  Returned by Motor 4.30 p.m.</p>
