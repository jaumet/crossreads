I have often watched their effect from a safe distance. There are special parties formed for this bombing work, also for working trench-mortars, and for snipers and what they term "stunt" parties. During a bombardment of the enemies trenches a certain portion is left free for attack. Naturally all the more timid Germans congregate in this section of trench. The bombardment ceases for six minutes and it is the work of the stunting party to sally forth from their own trench and capture or kill as many of the enemy in this section as possible and return to their own trench within the six minutes. This party is specially trained in football &c.I saw a Company with their masks on to-day & they looked most peculiar. I will send you a snap of them as soon as possible. The sight of aeroplanes sailing overhead has now become too common to be worthy of remark. At any hour of the day that one goes outside they are to be seen circling around.The rain is pouring down outside and Salisbury is fast becoming a mud flat.I was very sorry to hear that Douglas had discolated  his shoulder at Football - that most barbarous of games.
