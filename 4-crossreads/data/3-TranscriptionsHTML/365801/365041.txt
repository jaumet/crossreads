<p>[Letter sent in the above envelope. To Judge Ferguson from Major R.F. Fitz Gerald, with account of 5th May action.  See 'of Australia in the War of 1914-1918'; Vol. VII, p. 198]<br/>"Flanders"<br/>9.6.16</p>
<p>Dear Judge Ferguson,<br/>I have your letter of March 5th, which arrived some ten days ago.  Our mails are very irregular indeed &amp; we have had no parcels for some little time.  However they will all arrive in time.<br/>You will be surprised to hear that Col. Lamrock has left us &amp; is now on his way back to Sydney.  He &amp; others were considered too old for the strenuous work this fighting entails, &amp; they have had to make way for younger men.  Even the higher ranks are to be thinned.  He did not like it at first, but after a talk with that incomparable leader of men, General Birdwood, he was quite satisfied.  He is also happy over receiving his C.B. &amp; will probably be decorated by the King before leaving.</p>
