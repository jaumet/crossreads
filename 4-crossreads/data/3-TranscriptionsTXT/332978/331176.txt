 97 December 12th I am glad OByrne passed; I am extremely sorry that old Leckler is not with us &amp; as soon as I am exchanged, I will certainly do all in my power to have him repatriated as soon as possible. It is a crying shame, when one knows that far worse cases than our own are being overlooked, &amp; still our govt will not interest themselves unnecessarily as regards Prisoners of war &ndash; 
 December 13th There is a Cinema show here twice a week. Officers also go out for a walk twice a week. There are about 600 officers here French &amp; English, &amp; the Camp is run very systematically. The German staff here is equally as good as at Freiburg &ndash; very polite, perhaps it is because this is purely a concentration camp for people eligible for repatriation &ndash; 
 Very cold indeed our mess is going along O.K. I play plenty of Bridge nowadays, especially with Tremlott &amp; Stones &amp; Gracie 
 December 14th 130 French officers, who passed the Swiss Comm. June last, left early this morning &ndash; 
 Had long yarn with Matthews &amp; Bernard, Australians of 5 Div captured last August,. They came from Strohen &amp; have related to me some most horrifying incidents &ndash; I was glad to learn thro them that Gardiner &amp; all 4 Bgde officers there are O.K. &amp; well. Several attempts to escape have been made &amp; quite a lot succeeded. Mott was successful in his first attempt &ndash; 
 Played Bridge &ndash; 
 December 15th The cooking arrangements at this camp cannot compare with those at Freiburg, otherwise the camp is quite a good one &ndash; 
 Had a glorious bath today, the bathing arrangements are simply perfect, that is where Freiburg goal failed. 
 Received my first parcel today it was forwarded on from Freiburg &ndash; 
 French concert tonight The orchestra here is really splendid, simply marvellous for a Kriegsgefangener orchestra &ndash; 
 December 16th (Sunday) The Senior officer here is a naval Commander &ndash; He officiates at the English Service which is held every Sunday &ndash; we have a very nice chapel here. 
 The arrangements for Drawing parcels is more complete than at Freiburg, whilst the tin drawing system could not be better &ndash;
