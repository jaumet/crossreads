<p>all over the place right out in the open &amp; not more than <strike>a</strike> 1000 yards away from the German guns, anywhere else I have been you could scarcely show your nose out of a communication trench without getting a dose of shrapnel over on to you.<br/>22nd. Last night every man was issued with 2 bombs &amp; 2 sandbag's, &amp; he has got to take these with him in the charge tonight<br/>Took a fatigue party of 21 men down today &amp; got a load of water for the firing line. Another furious bombardment this afternoon the Germans are making it a welter &amp; knocking scores of our blokes out &amp; wounding hundreds, God knows what it is like in their lines for our fire is much more severe than theirs.<br/>I have just come back from a visit to the firing line, all the Coy N.C.O.'s. were over, or supposed to go over</p>
