<p>Dear Mr. McRae</p>
<p>Just a line to tell you I attended &amp; was with your boy &ndash; Pte. J.D. McRae &ndash; at one of our Main Dressing Stations where he died.  His wounds were severe, though he was in little pain &amp; for a while we were hopeful of his recovery.  But it was not to be &ndash; he gradually sank &amp; passed peacefully away during the night of the 19th.</p>
<p>His thoughts were with his home people all through, &amp; several times he asked me to send you his love.</p>
<p>I buried him the next day in a military cemetery at Dickebusch &ndash; a place near Ypres.  The grave is registered &amp; marked with a cross &amp; you may be sure will be looked after as you would wish.</p>
<p>With all sympathy in your sorrow.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>W.K. Douglas<br/>Chaplain<br/>12th Bn. A.I.F.</p>
