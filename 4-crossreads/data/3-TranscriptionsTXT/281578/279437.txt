as brigade quartermaster sergeant - he draws the rations for the 4th brigade from divisional Q.M. and issues them to the Q.M. of 13th, 14th, 15 & 16 Bns. His good friend, Eldridge, he collared as assistant & they have a billet to themselves in a hayshed at an estaminet, so I shifted my diggings to their crib - nothing like making yourself at home in the army. The people here  are bonza & I had a ripping time. While Booey & Eldridge were using the tucker I put some water on the stove to boil for our tea. There were two girls, 29 & 27 ( I always ask them "quel age") & a very kind old lady & 2 or three other nice women, talk about fun, I got on splendidly rattling out French. About 8 p,m. I came in to the room to write up my diary, they were all just sitting down to tea, as the estaminet is open to the soldiers from 6 to 8, I suppose they leave tea till late. When I entered the room behind the bar, there was the family sitting down to tea, there was Georgette, the pick of the bunch, Bertha, both of whom are engaged to soldiers
