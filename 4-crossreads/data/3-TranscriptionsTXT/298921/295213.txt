August, 1915Monday 30Henry was blocked from going to Australia, & is now back in Hospital here with a sort of Infuenza - He was Boarded & told to do duty at Alexandria - bad luck after building on going home. He is in bed alongside. He has just told Col: Mandesley that he is a breeder of Shorthorns & Sheep in the Riverina. We just stopped him using an empty Hot water bag (which the sister had left alongside bed) as a urine bottle!!I have found out the use of the piano - it drowns the squeals of the men when the poor beggars are getting their dressings done & others coming out of anaesthetic "Long live the piano"!
