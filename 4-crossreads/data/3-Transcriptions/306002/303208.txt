<p>27.6.15<br/>Sun. 27th.  A rally of rifle &amp; machine gun fire woke us soon after daylight this morning.  The Turks we [were] apparently having a joke with us &amp; started the business by dropping a few bombs on us, one dropped on the roof of the Drs. dug-out but fortunately it never exploded.  We had to stand to arms for half an hours.  The Turkish artillery played havoc with the New Zealanders' trenches &amp; a piece of a shell fell in "Dad" Howarths dug-out cutting his blanket &amp; oilsheet &amp; only missed "Dad" by an inch or two.  The Turks undermined the 8th L.H. on the "R.F." &amp; blew up there H.Q. at 2 a.m. this morning, killing &amp; wounding a good many of them, quite a number of casualties on the beach to-day also &amp; a bomb thrown over Courtneys Post accounted for 11 men.  We have been suffering rather heavily during the last few days.  The Turks are using a German mortar to throw bombs &amp; it doing good work for them.</p>
