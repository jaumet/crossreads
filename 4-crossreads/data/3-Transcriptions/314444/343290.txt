<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Seeing an article from you in the "Herald" dated 8.12.15 concerning letters received from soldiers [at] the front, I have very much pleasure in sending you these two along, hoping that they will be of benefit to any of your readers [at] The Library.</p>
<p>I take it that they will be kept in good order, &amp; that, when the writers come home from the war they could read them by attending [at] The Library &ndash; that is, if they so wished.</p>
<p>Walter Anderson is late of Eastwood; &amp; Walter Hillier late of Mortlake.</p>
<p>I am Yrs resp<br/>Chas. Soloman</p>
