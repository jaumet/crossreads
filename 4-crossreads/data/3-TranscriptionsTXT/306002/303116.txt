21.4.15Wed. 21st.  Five o'clock reveille this morning, had an early breakfast, saddled up, & then had to stack our kit bags in the Mess room.  We then pulled down the tents, & stacked them, & left the Aerodrome camp at 8.30.  We went through Heliopolis into Cairo, & then on to Maadi, we arrived there about 3 o'clock & had no chance of getting dinner before 3.30.  We were very hungry otherwise had a fair good-day, saw Alick Samuels & Perritot after tea & then went to the Stadium & witnessed one or two very willing goes, retired to bed at 9.30.  Idleboy is still lame in the shoulder & I rode one of Edmund's horses.
