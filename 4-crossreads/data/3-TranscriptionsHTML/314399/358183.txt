<p>Saturday 5 July 1919<br/>Here we are once again. Am 25 today. Some huge age too. Met Janet at Victoria at 2.30. Poor kid she had had some rushing at Brighton. We got a bus to Ludgate Circus &amp; then walked to Liverpool St. Went into 3 jewellers before buying the ring. Cost &pound;16/10/ &amp; is very decent. Not quite as good as some I would like to have bought. Still finance was the trouble. Went back to Hyde Park for a stroll then to the Trocadero for dinner &amp; then to see Monsieur Beaucaire at the Princes. Gee it was lovely. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Got the 12.5 to Brighton. Had to get a policeman to help me wake up the hotel people. Then took Janet home &amp; came back to bed. Was in by 3 am. A most glorious day. Did me.</p>
<p>Sunday 6 July 1919<br/>Up at 7.30. Brekker in bed. Bonny bath too. Read the papers &amp; then went for a stroll on to the esplanade &amp; West pier. A lot of swimming going on but very poor. Met Whitehead. He said I might get a boat without going into camp by going to Belgrave Sq &amp; will go tomorrow. Met Janet at 6 pm. We went for a stroll. Then had something to eat &amp; then to the beach. Got the 9.35 pm train back. Slept nearly all the way too. Train stopped at the Junction so got out &amp; was in bed at 11 pm. Goodo. Marie sent me a book of poems by Mrs Wilcox as a birthday present.</p>
