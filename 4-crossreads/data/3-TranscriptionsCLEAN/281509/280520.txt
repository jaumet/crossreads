 Rain & thick mist.  Scratch for breakfast. Fall in for moving off at 9.30. Stand about for 1 hr. Move off slip & slide down hill  & up another, falls & guffaws. Main road. Block off traffic. 5 yards & stop. most tiring, slush & creamy mud. Immense convoys the "pomp & circumstance" of war. Mud bespattered horses & men. This is the side that has no charm. Took till 4 p.m to make 2 miles. Pass thro' Fricourt, Montbaum & Mametz. Camp in Mametz wood.. search for dugouts. Such confusion of holes & fallen trees. Manage to get into a warren & make ourselves as comfortable as damp smelly hole would afford. Back to pre-historic times. living in the ground. Beaucoup bombard all night.
