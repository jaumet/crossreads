<p>GALLIPOLI,<br/>3rd September 1915.</p>
<p>My dear Mother.</p>
<p>Just a few lines to say that we have been over here for about a fortnight and am thankful to say that I am still whole, in fact none of the Section have been wounded yet.  We have all of course, had some pretty narrow escapes, but a miss here is as good as a mile.  Where we are now, we are pretty safe, in fact practically the only danger is from Snipers, and you May be sure, we don't give them much of a show.</p>
<p>You of course understand that we are not allowed to say anything that might be interesting.</p>
<p>Arthur Adams is camped very close to us and also several other chaps I know well.  Major Martin is also near here, but have not seen him yet.</p>
<p>The flies here are simply awful, and it is a work of art to get some food to your mouth without half a dozen of them on it.  There are also some other of the insect tribes.</p>
<p>The food here is pretty good, in fact better than I expected;  that is of course under the circumstances.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that is about the extent of the news I am allowed to say anything about, except of course I am well.  Address as usual to Egypt.</p>
<p>Harry wishes to be remembered to you all.</p>
<p>With love from<br/>Your Loving Son<br/>Roy.</p>
<p>Up to the time I left Egypt I had received your first letter and two from Ruby.</p>
<p>R.R.</p>
