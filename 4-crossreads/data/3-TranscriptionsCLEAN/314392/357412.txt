the ship all day we disembarked about 4pm and entrained for Port Suez. It is a beautiful night and it is just as well for us that it is for we are huddled up in open cattle trucks. Guess we do travel in style - The officers of course have first class carriages, for I suppose the war could not go on if they had to rough it like the boys.The train pulled away from the wharf about 7pm and came to a stop at Said station. Nearby was a stack of English beer and of course within a short time that stack (or the greater portion of it)
