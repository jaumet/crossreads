<p>Monday 14 January<br/>Last night was very cold &amp; freezing but early this morning was quite warm and the ground was snow covered to a depth of six inches. Not a breath of wind and the result is the snow is heavy on the trees &amp; the landscape presents the same faireyland appearance as it did about three weeks ago.  Snowballing in force. A walk, very slippery, to Ballieul again. News that "Lea Brook" has been sold.</p>
<p>Tuesday 15 January<br/>A true winters day.<br/>A heavy westerly wind blowing up gusts of heavy rain in intervals, raining all day.  Not cold but the prospects are of more rain.</p>
