<p>7-2-17<br/>Wed 7th<br/>At 9 oclock this morning heavy artillery were firing from the Wadi El Arish when the Anti Air Craft guns opened up rapid fire at a Taube that appeared coming in at a great height between us &amp; the sun the guns gave us a good exhibition of shooting at long range &amp; the Taube made off followed by a couple of our planes who rose at sight of the enemy;</p>
<p>Otherwise had a quiet day &amp; pulled down our "bivy" this afternoon; There are plenty of clouds in the sky tonight &amp; no danger of Taubes; Heard today that my application for a Commission went throught to Division without a hitch &amp; should have had it a couple of days later when it fell void through Sutherland returning;</p>
