<p>June 19<br/>Rested all the morning.  Scotty &amp; I explore the bazaar &amp; town.  The place is absolutely desolate &amp; portion of the bazaar has been burnt by the Russians before their evacuation.  Very little stuff of any description in the bazaar, and dire poverty rampant.</p>
<p>The surrounding country is rather pretty.  Bijah itself is built at the head of a valley, running from the North East.  To the North &amp; NW the land rises to rolling hills, while the other part of the city is surrounded by steep mountains.  A sentry group is posted on the heights above our camp, owing to its suitability as an O.P. which overlooks the road from the North, North west and South to Hamadan.</p>
<p>From information received the people have been dying like flies owing to famine &amp; cholera.  Rained for about 5 minutes was the first we have seen since Kermanshar.</p>
