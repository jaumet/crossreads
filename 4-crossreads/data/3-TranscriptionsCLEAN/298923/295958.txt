19 October 1918 SaturdayKantara EastHad a good night & much stronger-  Quinine making me a bit deaf-  A boat load passed through Canal with 1944 men from France- rosy cheeked & fresh complexioned so different to the yellow looking fever men from here.  Still hoping to cross the Canal tomorrow but all the Base Hospitals are full. Got letters from Mother Sept 1st Kathleen Sept 8 & Jack Forth- glad all's well
