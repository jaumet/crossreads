<p>13:  Raymond of 3rd regt. killed by premature bursting of a bomb.  Had only been over for weeks.  Getting plenty of work &amp; gun classes; regiments drilling daily in the sand.</p>
<p>17:  Left Makeab 6 a.m. &amp; glad to get away from the "rest camp".  Pitched camp at kilo 9", dirty, dusty camp.  Div. reserve Brigade.</p>
<p>19:  Horses of 1st regt. stampeded owing to a taube over bombing; seven horses killed.</p>
<p>20:  Dorset yeomanry bombed by taubes five killed, 17 wounded &amp; 30 horses mutilated.</p>
<p>24:  Another mock action; capturing a redoubt for benefit of a few brass hats.  Had to advance about two miles on foot, with our guns &amp; loaded gun belts.</p>
<p>26:  Alarm sounded; Bde. called out at 10 a.m. only to find that it was another of their demonstrations for the benefit of some foreign heads.  Inspected on the parade ground by Gen Cox, the vet condemning many of our horses owing to their poor state.</p>
<p>28: Still at "Kilo 9" &amp; all are fed up with the place; nobody knows what is going to happen, but many rumours to the effect that we are going to make a big push on this front shortly.</p>
