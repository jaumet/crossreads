<p>Sunday 19 August 1917</p>
<p>HOSPITAL<br/>No Church nearer than Alexandria so did not go.</p>
<p>Still very hot, damp but I am better.</p>
<p>Posted notes yesterday as you might think I have been really ill. I should have loved to get leave to England or AUSTRALIA but no hope at present.</p>
<p>Am not rejoicing at going back on Wednesday still it has to be did. Just received your Cable &ndash; "Hope Convalescent", thank you so much but really there has been nothing much wrong with me. It was dated 18th very quick. I wonder how you knew I was sick, from a Cable I suppose.</p>
