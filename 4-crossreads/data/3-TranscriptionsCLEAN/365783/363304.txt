  
 published after we left Melbourne - I am the senior major of our hospital & will be the first for promotion should any vacancy arise amongst the Lt. Cols. Nearly all our officers are a very decent lot of men & we all get on very well together. The men also are a splendid lot of chaps. I have not yet had occasion to reprimand Priv. Phillips - he is always very well behaved - he was present at a lecture I gave yesterday & was quite exemplary in his attention & desire to absorb the words of wisdom. I saw young Rainsforth for the first time this morning but was not speaking to him. The Budden's friend, I forget his name, is a very decent quiet young fellow.
