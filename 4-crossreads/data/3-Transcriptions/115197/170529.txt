<p>a short route march returning to the ship at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>At mid-day the &quot;Rio Pardo&quot; is towed into &quot;Table Bay&quot;, and then we commence in earnest the last stage of our voyage to Australia.&nbsp; Table Mountain &amp; Lion&#39;s Head seen for the last time as our vessel draws away from land are indelibly printed in my mind.</p>
<p>Farewell &quot;S.A.&quot;!</p>
