 My Darling Eddy, 
 No doubt you have had a Happy Xmas   &amp;  New Year by the time this reaches you. This is a picture of the place when I sleep. It is a very old   &amp;  rather the worse for wear but we have comfy beds   &amp;  that is a good thing these times. 
 We had another fall of snow the other morning but it did not last long. Looked very pretty but fearfully cold. Heaps of love   &amp;  kisses  OOO  XXXXXXX From Auntie Eadle
