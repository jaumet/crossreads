  
 September 1918. Sunday 1 
 Same position 3.30 am Awoke to find Mr Mays flashing a torch in my eyes. Told that the line was down and that I had to  toddle at the Suites. Went out in the rain to the O.P. Phil  Thresher wounded in face at 7pm.  Had a heave of very heavy stuff across, gas galore. All "D" subs gunners gassed. Richards and Williams badly gassed. Orders came through to the effect that we will have to cross the Somme tonight. I expect  twill be a very rough spin, however good luck. Peronne captured today by 14th Inf  Bdge.  A very dirty outlook tonight. Left home all clear at  7.30pm.
