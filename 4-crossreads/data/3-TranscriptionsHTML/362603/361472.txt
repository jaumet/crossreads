<p>Bullford<br/>24.6.17<br/>Dear Mum,<br/>I haven't much news at any time but by answering Your letters I'll be able to fill up a couple of pages &amp; let you know that I am still well &amp; having a lovely time.  I have to work hard nearly always but I always take two afternoons off every week &amp; go to Salisbury.  My Friends there are of the best &amp; I go in &amp; make myself at Home just as I did at Bess' place &amp; You know that English People are very reserved.  My Best plan to follow is to tell You how I spent my last two afternoons.  I went to Amesbury this Thursday instead of Salisbury.  I first set off in the Pouring rain &amp; alone.  It rained all the way in, - it is 3 &frac12; miles- &amp; then I walked round the River Walk till I thought I have afternoon Tea at 4 p.m.  After Tea I went for a walk in another direction &amp; called at a Friend's House but everyone was out.  So I came back &amp; went to the Army Hut near the Bridge for something to eat.  After that I went for another short stroll &amp; met My Friends walking down the village Street.  I went Home with them &amp; had dinner.  I stayed for about an Hour chatting away &amp; then set out for Camp at 8.45 pm.  It is over 3 &frac12; miles from Camp &amp; I was in my room at 9.30 pm.  Ellis was out but I knew where to find Him.  Ern. Thomas</p>
