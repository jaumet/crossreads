<p>1918<br/>Thu. 4th Apl. (cont.)<br/>We followed this with coffee and beer in the 1st class Restaurant;  a huge gaudy place with much marone draping and nothing to eat on sale.  En passant &ndash; half of the Bahnhof is in ruins.   A plane bomb dropped here during a recent air raid.   At 2.30 pm we left for Heidelberg.   Outside Darmstadt I got my first view of camouflage. &ndash; a Zeppelin hangar with fields and red-roofed cottages apparently sprouting from the roof.</p>
<p>Store, troop, gun, &amp; gas trains are all rushing South.</p>
<p>We are now in Baden &ndash; a beautiful province.</p>
<p>Dozens of castles dotting hills here and there with little villages straggling down from the castle walls &ndash; the country is dotted and avenued with blossoming fruit-trees, and the clumsy farm carts are drawn by a magnificent breed of white oxen.</p>
