<p>killing a crowd &amp; more raids are to follow.<br/>We really have them well in hand &amp; are only waiting for the word to move forward.  What a day that will be &amp; what a sight for the Gods to see the boys of the 20th let loose on the Huns.  May I be there to see.  I too have noticed the large number of lost men, but the Honor List might steady them a bit.  France is a beautiful country except where the Hun has spread desolation.  Some day I hope to tell you some of his doings, I could not write details.  But he is "up against it" now &amp; the end does not look too far distant.<br/>I hope you have seen the Anzac Book.  Read the poem "Anzacs".  Fragments from France is also well worth seeing &amp; is true to life.</p>
