The cases there are all men taken ill in camp and constitute a small fraction of the total number of sick in the camp. There are at least 200 of them. Several Russian doctors (themselves prisoners) attend under Hun supervision. Medicine is unobtainable; the food is unfit for human consumption, but the unfortunate men are compelled to eat it.
