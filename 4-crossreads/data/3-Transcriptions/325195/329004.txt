<p>14.11.15<br/>Sun 14th<br/>We got a message through to-day from Bde HQ telling us to send a man down to Anzac to get a model bomb-proof shelter belonging to Col Merrington &amp; that we should take care of it till we heard from him; I believe Col  Merrington has left the Peninsula &amp; is on his way to England apparently he has put in some of his time here inventing bomb-proofs; he always took a great interest in any movements here, &amp; I believe he knew more about both ours &amp; the enemy's position than any other Col on the Peninsula; The Turks &amp; our lads on Walkers Ridge have a bomb fight every night &amp; both sides of Artillery throw a good many shells about, but to the men in the trenches things are generally quiet.</p>
