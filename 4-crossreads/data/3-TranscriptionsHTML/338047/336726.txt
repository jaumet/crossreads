<p>1918<br/>June<br/>collapsed backward into his possie and was seen no more. We found another swimming hole about &frac12; kilo away, and used to go down to it frequently for a dip. One day whilst going to Glisy village to the YMCA, I met Stan Roulston who was a sig. in our Reinfs. He had been sent to the 5th Battn. The fields looked wonderful at this time with the wealth of color they displayed. In among the wheat one could see the red of the poppies, blue cornflowers, yellow buttercups and big white daisies &ndash; all in profusion.

It was not attended by any Hun planes as the other had been. Wonderful speeds were apparently reached because the competitors were swimming down stream with the current which was fairly strong. We were issued with Khaki Blanco and Brasso</p>
