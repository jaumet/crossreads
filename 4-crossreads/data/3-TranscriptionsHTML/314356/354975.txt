<p>January 3<br/>20.<br/>Midday Ken comes form the Chateau, with word from Geoff of an immediate return to Australia stunt for draftsmen, on the condition of six months work drafting for the home Military.  Our three names in, but a wondering remains:  the idea of a further six months working with Tabb'd Authority &ndash; Ken, Hardy and the five disgusting Majors loom ahead &ndash; is worse than another year's warring.</p>
<p>Q and G delivered ultimatums today, asking for trainees to be brought to the office to succeed 1915 men as their turns for drafts come.</p>
<p>January 3, 4<br/>Mail:  Barrie's and Dunsany's new books &ndash; "Echoes of Warr" and "Tales of War".  By the fire &ndash; which went out, read "The Old Lady" and "The New World", two bon little pieces like laughing sunny days of April.</p>
<p>January 4<br/>21.<br/>Arthur and Ken away in the morning to Brussels:  our Bruges and Antwerp application through "Q" now for Corps to 'yea' or 'Nay'.  Mac back to 'G' from Corps, and word out for men to commence understudying G and Q men.  Their manifests of two days ago to figureheads, followed by good results:  already there seems a wondering in their minds:  soon they'll have to work!</p>
