<p>7 from Elsie, &amp; 1 each from Will, Nin &amp; Mone. They were full of interesting news, &amp; it took me nearly till midnight to digest them. The chaps around me are snoring, bar a happy party who are talking &amp; laughing, happy &amp; half shick after partaking of much vin banc. <br/>Friday 24 May I was told to attend at a N.C.O's class today, it lasts 6 days. There are 16 corporals at it. The 4 of us from D Coy reported at B.O.R., &amp; were told to go to the hangars to the battalion parade ground. Over we went to the hangars in the green field, &amp; the 14th Bn were there, no sign of our lot; we looked round, sat down, then returned to the village, &amp; found our battalion were in a field on the other side. It was a glorious site, the clover was thick with flowers, &amp; red poppies grew amongst the green grass, &amp; lovely green trees waved in the breeze. I had to smile when we turned up at the school, they started on left &amp; right turn, &amp; sloping arms by numbers. A Lt is in charge. Some of the chaps have been in the trenches a long time &amp; are pretty rotten on their detail, but I've had so much of this stuff, I know it off by heart. It rained &amp; we didn't go out in the afternoon. After tea</p>
