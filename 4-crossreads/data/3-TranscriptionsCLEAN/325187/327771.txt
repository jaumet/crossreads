 The natives are very shy out here & at sunset string in to water each leading an animal a lamb to a Camel- Women are never seen between the ages of 8 or 80, they appear to be kept in absolute seclusion.  Field Officer today, this is the work of a Major, but Captains do it- practically Orderly Officer to the Brigade. What women we do see are very modest!! & generally wear only one garment, so when they unexpectedly meet a European they throw this over their head feeling sure they have done the correct thing, but the rest of their body does not even boast a fig leaf-
