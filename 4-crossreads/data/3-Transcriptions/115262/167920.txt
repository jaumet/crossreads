<p>Saturday 2 June 1917.</p>
<p><u>&quot;Still at sea&quot;</u>&nbsp;&amp; air very foul in No 3 &amp; No 4 deck. Paraded with bad cold &amp; was given &quot;no duty&quot;. (1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;time since entering camp that I&#39;ve had to parade sick). Japanese Cruiser signalling <s>&quot;short of coal&quot;</s></p>
<p>We are now 1 day behind time &amp; at 6 pm have 155 tons of coal left in bunkers to get to Colombo&nbsp;&ndash; now 250 miles away.</p>
<p>Stayed above deck &amp; read &amp; yarned. Went aft at 6 pm &amp; watched &quot;log&quot;.</p>
<p>Air slightly improved &amp; cold feeling a shade better.</p>
