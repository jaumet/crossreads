Some Egyptian laborers on the Beach, found a Bomb & thinking it was a lamp lit it!!! The result was a big mess, & the rest are more careful - these laborers are Greeks, Gypsies, etc & we are not too keen on them as Spies are found at times & after Greece "selling us a Pup" over this place we are not over in love with them at present. I am very happy Mother at being back again & all is well so worry not - I stand the cold a great deal better than ever I expected to be able to do.
