Still wet prospects of more rain. A walk round to Remi Siding a look over the grave yard at the C.C.S's which grew very much as the result of the Ypres stunts.We move tomorrow entrain for the Somme where things seems to be livening up for a German attack.
Saturday 6 April
What luck. After many days rain to-day is fine for moving. We marched from Hoograf to Godewaersvelde where we entrained. The march lay along the base of the Mont des Cats I was on the wheel stretchers ? pack. Godewaersvelde of course is in France. At 2 a.m. we are now at Amiens on the Somme Fritz is about eight-ten miles out towards Albert St. Quentin. A journey, via St. Omer, Calais, Boulogne Abbeville was made in cattle trucks. Our billets are about 4 kilos out on the Abbeville road.
The City of Amiens is full of inhabitants from villages within the new danger zone they naturally think things are very black. In a big attack last week four uhlans were seen in here repulsed by Armoured Cars!! Marvellous how they got through.
