 Septembre 19 Worked on shelters for a few hours this morning but returned early to camp owing to shortage of matial. Terrific firing by our batteries at times. Enemy replying vigorously. 
 Septembre 20 We attacked the enemy positions early this morning &amp; in the course of about 2 &frac12; hours gained all our objectives. We are now dug in well about 300x ahead of the farthest objective asked to be taken. The 1st and 2nd Divs have done most of the fighting so far. Our Div is being held in Reserve &amp; we expect to have something doing before long. Germans counter attacked on our new positions at dusk. They were driven off everywhere with heavy loss.
