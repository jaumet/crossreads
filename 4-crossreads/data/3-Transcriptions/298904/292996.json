<p>This silence lasted until midnight on the 3rd day, &amp; the instant time was up talk about a rifle fire I think nearly everyone had a go &amp; relieved his feelings, it had been a most trying time for all concerned, &amp; every one was glad when they could fire again, I expect the old Turks chuckled to themselves when we started to fire again, but the silence had served its purpose, &amp; little did they know it.
