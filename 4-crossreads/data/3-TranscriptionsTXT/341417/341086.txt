 Dear Albert 
 Just a few lines to let you know, I am still in this hospital &amp; doing well, although my leg hasn't healed up yet, &amp; I am still lame. I may be getting transferred to one of our own hospitals shortly, as the Doctor says it might take some time, &amp; that I would be better off, in one of our own, but to tell you straight, I would not, as I have a lovely time here. I go to the Doctor's place once a week for tea, &amp; I alway's manage a good feed there, as his wife knows what Australian's like. Then I always manage a drive, to various places with the Nurses, who are simply lovely. Of course, I still get about with the old stick, &amp; I will soon need a new one, as I am always knocking it about, such as playing golf with stones, &amp; also playing hockey, with the other cripples. There has been another big air raid on London, but with fewer casualties this time, &amp; one can hardly imagine, that they do not kill more, as the streets are always packed. The papers here are kicking up a great fuss over the Mesopotamia muddle, &amp; it is on every body's lips, &amp; I reckon it is awful myself, &amp; must have been a lot worse than the Dardanelles affair. Well Albert old boy, there is not much news this time, so I will ask you, to remember me to everybody, &amp; hope they are all in the best of health, the same as it leaves me at present. 
 Your's sincerely, Wilfred. 
 P.S. I don't know whether my last letter to you, went down with the "Mongolia" or not, so bad luck if it did. Hoo-ray.
