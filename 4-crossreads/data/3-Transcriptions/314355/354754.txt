<p>April 28<br/>stiff elaborate hanging cloaks clasping with jewells across the breast.</p>
<p>Upstairs is a gem a caret:  an ivory Christ exquisitively carved and clear.  It is only five inches high, mounted on a tall <strike>brass</strike> black wood cross heavily pedestelled.</p>
<p>Today &ndash; it seems beastly:  but if its left it will only be powdered or burnt:  all yesterday the regular shells fell in Caestre, and from the very assoccian [association ?] of it only does this hesitation come.  On the High Altar of the Church is a small thin silver cup, daintily embroidered all about with a tiny intricate dotting, and a tiny shield, "M45".</p>
<p>But the Ivory Christ:  it would fit so beautifully to a carved bas-relief design of the Crucifiction &ndash; a cross with flanking of the two side pieces of the Crucifile of Perugino.</p>
<p>And an hour after this entry, when I went up to the terrace, the pedestal was on the floor, and in the next room the empty cross.</p>
<p>April 28, 29<br/>90.<br/>Ernie Succo through early this afternoon &ndash; his left arm blown away at the elbow:  amputated here.  The "Laughing Squad" is broken.</p>
<p>The rumour that the Boche have won Kemmel Hill and Dranoutre seems confirmed today.  It seems from this the whole of the salient will have to be evacuated, it will be "a stragetic [strategic ?] victory" for the Tommy Press.  Rumours too of another big attack bracing.</p>
<p>The day dull, and a faint mist low in the sky:  quiet till now &ndash; 3 p.m., a big long bombarding has just broken out.</p>
<p>91.<br/>About five days ago Major Stewart was detached from the Ambulance for duty with the Artillery, 1st Bgde.  He was killed today.  Requiescat In Pace.  [Drawing of cross.]  He was only lately from the Base, a Victorian, and a good man in the Dressing Room.</p>
<p>April 29<br/>92.<br/>From 3 a.m. till 10, almost uninterrupted shelling about the A.D.S., the rail and the old empty encampments:  and behind the sudden burstings</p>
