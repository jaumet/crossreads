Have been suffering lately from a severe attack of tonsilitis and it is still very sore I have been keeping going with my work but it is hard as I am living only on milk biscuits bought at canteen as it has been almost impossible to eat hard rations. Went on sick parade on Sunday and Dr gave me some tabs to suck and some calomel but they gave me little relief It is difficult to keep a diary going as it is a very monotonous routine
