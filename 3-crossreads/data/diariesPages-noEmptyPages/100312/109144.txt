4/11/17 Florence
der Lanzi. Went into the Galleria degli Uffizi and saw many great paintings by Rafael, Rubens, Titian c. In sculptures saw the Venus de Medici c. From the windows here a fine view is obtained of the River Arno and its bridges and of Beatrice and Dante's walk. The Ponte Vecchio is an old bridge built all over with goldsmith and jewellers shops. Saw the Cathedral which is entirely faced with marble. The dome is very large being little smaller than St. Peters at Rome. A service was being sung while we were in. Went across the street to the Battistero and there saw a christening in progress. All the infants have to be brought here. The two bronze ?Gates of Paradise" were walled up but we saw one a little inferior. The ceiling is all gold mosaic work and rather crude. The campanile of the Cathedral is also marble encrusted very tall
