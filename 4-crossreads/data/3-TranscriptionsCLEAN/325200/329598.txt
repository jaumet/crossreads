  
 troops advancing on Katia. At 1.30 we had Katia surrounded at 2.30 a general attack was made  &  kept up until dark but we had, I think bitten off a bit more than we could chew  &  at 7.30 out crowd came home followed by the regiments. I believe today our infantry is out there attacking it, but I don't know how they are getting on. About morning again a mob of 50-60 prisoners were escorted past the camp. On the 4th there was also an attack at Muhammadiyah  by 2000 turks which also failed.
