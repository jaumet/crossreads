<p>sent you a book about it) well! that wood <sub>^</sub><sup>Ploegsteert</sup> is just below me looking in its leafless state and under the continuous drizzle a most mournful object, so different from my last sight of it in the springtime with the green of fresh foliage, the blossom of some ruined gardens and with wood violets, hyacinths and other wildflowers sprinkling the ground.&nbsp; Another mournful change too, is the number of small cemeteries visible from our hillside indicated by clusters of white crosses, <sub>^</sub><sup>each</sup> erected over the grave<s>s</s> of some soldier who has (as we say) &quot;Gone West.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; But why be gloomy? are we not up from the trenches and as far as we know out for a month to reinforce, to train and to recuperate, I can tell you we look forward to these spells particularly after the sticky time we have had of late.&nbsp; Yes, we have just finished eight days in trenches, seven in reserve, eight more das in the trenches, and are now in close support which means that in an emergency we will be first to reinforce those in the line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; We took over a terribly bad sector <sub>^</sub><sup>opp Warneton on R of River Douve</sup> from an English Regular Battalion, they had xxx provided no accomodation for their men who stayed awake on the firesteps all night, then slept all day sitting on the firesteps, rain, wind and cold notwithstanding; Fritz had his own way in No Man&#39;s Land and wiggled off one of their posts whenever he felt like risking it.&nbsp; That could not last, it was not our Brigade Policy by any means, so we had been in only two days when every man had a little &quot;Bivvy&quot; a shelter, rainproof though</p>
