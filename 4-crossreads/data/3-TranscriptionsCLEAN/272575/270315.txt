 My Dear Mother 
 No doubt you allready know that the Brigade is in France, we had a splendid trip over.   Stopped at Toulon en Route, but no Troops were allowed ashore, as we were only there for one night, Toulon is a very pretty place, the hills rising behind the town, on the Southern side of the bay are orchards etc, and some rather fine buildings, we landed at Marseilles and entrained straight away.   The journey through France takes some time and we were only out of the Train for a little while, at some of the Stopping places, but I enjoyed every hour of daylight, France is a beautiful country, with its tiny green fields and hedges, along the line every piece of land that is any good is cultivate even on the hillsides, where you would think it was allmost too steep to cultivate, the line follows a River, or I should say, runs beside a river, for miles, I dont know the name of the stream, but it is a pretty trip along the valley and when the spring is more advanced and the hedges etc, are green it will be pretty indeed,   Along some parts of the line patches of Primroses and Cowslips were growing in abundance, and daisies they grow every where. just the same daisies that we take so much trouble to grow here.   The fields will soon be white with them.
