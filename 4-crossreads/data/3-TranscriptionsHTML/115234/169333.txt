<p><u>27<sup>th</sup> March &quot;18</u></p>
<p>Am writing this sitting on the steps of a wayside shrine of the Virgin &amp; Child Just on the outskirts of the village <sup>-</sup>Thieushouk<sup>-</sup>&nbsp; We are on the march (And a forced one at that)&nbsp; The long expected German Offensive has come at&nbsp; last.&nbsp; Fritz has broken through the British Line on the Somme.&nbsp; All the places we (the Australians) took from him last year; he has taken back from the &quot;Tommys&quot;.&nbsp; As usual</p>
