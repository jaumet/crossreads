<p>7/8/19 Durban<br/>disease. Is this due to having so much work done by nigger servants. Went down to Lords Cricket Ground and saw a team from our Ship play a Durban team. A fine ground. Coming back to the boat passed the scores of people returning from work &ndash; a polyglot lot. In one place a little piece of India &ndash; two women cross legged sitting nursing their babies. Nostrils pierced to hold gold ornaments. Perhaps we shall not get away until Tuesday owing to coal shortage. Remained on the ship all the evening and had a bath turning in early to sleep. Round the wharves there are always scurrying crowds of flitting natives going from nowhere to the same place.</p>
