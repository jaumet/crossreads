5 of our Planes came out of the Heavens There was some circling & machine gun fireing & Fritz was gradually forced down & plunged headlong the last few hundred feet As it happened just at knock off some of us went over to see the machine. It had landed on the side of the Canal & was a compleete wreck. The pilot was not dead but badly broken up. The first freshly wounded man I have seen. This evening one of our Planes caught fire when at a great height & came down like a meteor Hear that the Pilot was only scorched a bit but "ha ma doubts"
