and tonight we had coffee for supper and went to bed thoroughly dried.
Tonight old Fritzie dropped some very heavy shells quite close to us but I don't think he done any damage.
Saw a great quantity of German "aerial torpedoes" they are a huge bomb and are very dangerous. 
15th We (as you can see ink is plentiful) so far we have not fared to well with D Coy our rations being very scanty, this morning a small issue of bread and a box of matches was our share.
To day we have been working making a new road to the camp and not before it is wanted for the road is in a most disgraceful state 2 waggons were pulled in halves this morning and there they stand nearly floating in the stuff.
