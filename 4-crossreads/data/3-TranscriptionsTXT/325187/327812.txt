I had also sent some money to Strange  for Opal but he did not receive it either, I mean at Dungalear.  Some awful fake photos are being published in Australian papers  The Sun 16/1/16 has one sent by Capt Reynolds of A.A. Service Corps shewing 4 wheeled G.S. Wagon & horses & Gippies loading Furniture!!!! & called the evacuation of ANZAC.It is so absurd, one wonders at a Paper printing such a thing.Killed a snake near Tent today, after centipede & Scorpions, but no one seems to get bitten
