[Saturday 1 April 1916]
Sports on at Highland Mounted Brigade & I got some snapshots of the Scotchmen wrestling on Donkeys & a Camel Race. Letter from Nowell Forth today, from Sudan. We sent out Aeroplanes reconnaissance & dropped Bombs on some 200Senussi at Kharga Oasis but the weather has been against Flying. If you look at map of Nile you will see Sohag is a long way South   All sorts of rumours about returning North again soon but nothing definite.
