 37 Sunday 16th Jany 1916 My dear Father, 
 Your letter of 12th December just received, for which many thanks. I must first apologise for not answering before this your last batch of letters, bearing dates Novr 8th  21st  and 28th , also Christmas cards &amp; booklet &amp; cablegram. After writing Mother by last weeks mail I found I had run things too fine to finish my letter to you. 
 We have been kept at it very solidly since settling down here &ndash; Reveille at 6 a.m. stables till 7.30 then breakfast &ndash; and take the Battery out from 9 to 11 at drill. In for midday stables &amp; lunch and out again from 2 till 4.
