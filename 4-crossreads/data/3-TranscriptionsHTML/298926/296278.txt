<p>16th We have been issued with Basil Vests lined with felt  These are warmer and longer <br/>than the sheep skin vests.<br/>We have also been ordered to wear 2 pair of socks. This is to prevent what are called <br/>Trench feet.<br/>The weather is bitterly bleak and playing reveille is terribly cold work. <br/>We have a new major, Major Prince who comes from Brigade H'qrs staff to take the <br/>second in command in place of Major Cooke-Russell who has been sent to train <br/>backward battalions.</p>
