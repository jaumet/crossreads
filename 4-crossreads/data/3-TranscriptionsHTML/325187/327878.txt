<p>C.O. made me Mess Secretary to start a Regimental mess again as we have been separated so long in Squadrons   Very hot &amp; a man has no comforts on the Desert, the Flies are in myriads  <strike>We have an artillery road &amp; a light military railway</strike> Turkish aeroplanes come &amp; have a look at us, but keep their Bombs for shipping &amp; bigger game.  Cuth Fetherstonhough passed in the Trucks today <u>they</u> the 12:L.H. are now camped within a mile of us.<br/>I see my <u>Permanent</u> rank of Captain only went thro' in orders dated April 13th as no vacancy in Brigade occurred before- but I have been a Temporary Captain for 7 months</p>
