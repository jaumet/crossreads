<p>below to my bed I tumbled into it and slept soundly.We arrived in the harbour at Lemnos about eleven oclock. We had only been a few hours on the "Dongola" but we were splendidly looked after. The nurses on board were tumbling over themselves taking our photos.A rather amusing thing happened while the nurses were taking our photo some of the chaps who had cameras snapped the nurses at the same time. There were a large number of ships of all descriptions in the harbour mostly relating to the men of wars and hospital ships. Rumour has it that the Turks poured shrapnel all over the beach after we left this morning, luckily for us that we had flown. After we had dinner we embarked on the ships boats and were towed by a pinnace to the "Dunbar Castle". Col G. who was our O.C. up to two days ago but had left us before the evacuation, was on this ship. Some of our officers went aboard her for a short time. We then went to Mudros, one of the large towns on the Island. On our arrival there we had to march to Sarpi Camp. After a good deal of hanging about we found very uncomfortable quarters awaiting us.</p>
