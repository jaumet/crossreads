<p>26th Nov /17<br/>with a ship painted neutral color I could not differentiate. If the sun's light comes from behind the vessels, they both present identical targets.<br/>27th Novr /17<br/>Good weather and bright moonlight last night. This latter, one regrets, as while we would make an excellent target, a submarine would be almost invisible. Give me dark nights and storm. These conditions hamper submarine operations. Life aboard monotonous as we seem to have a cargo of unsociables.</p>
<p>28th 29th<br/>Calm weather (and 29th) bright glorious sunshine. Ships keep remarkably well together. Noon 29th course due E. and vessels opened out to full speed. Rumor hath it that</p>
