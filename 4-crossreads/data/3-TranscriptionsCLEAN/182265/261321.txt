  
  Monday 21st.  - Left Camp at 6am with 200 men for 4 days leave - disembarkation Leave - Waited at Codford Station from 7 to 8 & then entrained -  A beautiful trip to London - We marched from Paddington through Hyde Park, in front of Buckingham Palace & down Victoria Street to Horseferry Road Headquarters. There the men received a short lecture on their leave in London. 
 I made enquiries about several of my men in the Casualty Room. After a light lunch I visited St Pauls for an hour. It is much more beautiful in the bright sunlight. I then tubed to Mark Lane & visited the Tower of London. Here I met a party of Australians and Canadians, among them were Dr. Cos Fowler, Lt Les Fowler, & "Abdul" a Canadian.  &  We visited White Tower together. We then "taxied" to York Hotel, where Cos Fowler has his room. 
 Cos & myself then walked along Chancery Lane had a drink at "Ye Olde Mitre" & while drinking entered into conversation with some singer
