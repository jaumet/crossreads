<p>19 April 1915<br/>Monday 26 wks from home<br/>Revielle at 5.30<br/>Signalling as usual under Bill then stables after break I fitted a new handle on the axe &amp; then got onto Freans &amp; Cox bikes for tomorrow. After lunch the horses were exercised under Bert, I printed photos which didnt turn out too good on account of under exposure, news came hand that a mail was due today so hope its true. The LH went out for the day in the vicinity of Suez Road &amp; about 12 pm the machine guns came into action with the result that horses were seen galloping to camp from all directions. This inspection is to be good as the Col is out to do things properly, motor cyc's to be on parade also. Billy Wilson is gazette as Sgt to HQ sigs 1st Reg at last Bed at 9.30.</p>

<p>Revielle at 5.30<br/>Stables as per usual then signalling practice I had the usual run into Cairo got home about 12.30 for lunch cleaned up the seraf for tomorrow also every other article. In the afternoon we had an inspection by the Brigadier &amp; the motors had a three mile run to get to the parade ground over the desert. The inspection turned out OK, the Col was very [indecipherable] as to the turnout, we got back at 5.10 pm for tea. After tea the mail arrived &amp; I got one from Nell Ern &amp; Mother, news is very scarce in all of them, astounded to hear that Dorothy was married. After tea I played Larkin chess &amp; won all three games. About nine [indecipherable] from HQ came over with two despatches for Cairo &amp; as no motor cyc's were in I had to go in one to [indecipherable] HQ &amp; the other Base Depot. Bed at 11.30</p>
