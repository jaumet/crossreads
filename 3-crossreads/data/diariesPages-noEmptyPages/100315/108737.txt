1/4/18 ? La Basse Ville
like this one realises what a wretched existence it is in a dugout or pillbox dimly candle lit and filled with the breaths and odours of crowded humanity. At 6.30 p.m. the sun was shining and showing up the country about vividly. The villages for miles behind the German lines stood out most clearly and any movement could be seen. High up in the cloudless sky an enemy ?plane was being shot at by our archies. The Tommies were to have come up at this time but balloons bright conditions made it not at all advisable so to do.
