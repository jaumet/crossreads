<p>MAY 1917</p>
<p>1 TUESDAY</p>
<p>A perfect day. We packed</p>
<p>up &amp; left Brunembert</p>
<p>early &amp; camped at</p>
<p>Lonquenesse alongside</p>
<p>an aerodrome at night</p>
<p>I could find out no</p>
<p>news of Alan Although</p>
<p>I rang up the 60 squadron</p>
<p>they knew no further news.</p>
<p>I was on horse picket at</p>
<p>night. We slept under the</p>
<p>stars for the first time for nearly</p>
<p>a year.</p>
