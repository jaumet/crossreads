16/11/18 Yzeux
Fine sunny but desperately cold morning that chills one to the bone. Rode over to Vignacourt to another lecture by Sir Francis Younghusband and then over to lunch at St Vast and to attend the 22nd sports. It was desperately chilly here although the sun was brightly shining overhead. After a while here returned to Yzeux and had early mess going then to DHQ and having a yarn with General Robertson and Sir Francis Younghusband. The latter is interesting to talk to – an Empire builder and one of the better type of Englishmen. He had some interesting tales of Kitchener, Lloyd George and others. Like most influential Englishmen of the conservative class he does not like Ll. George. Walked home to Yzeux – bright frosty night and deadly cold that chills to the bone.
