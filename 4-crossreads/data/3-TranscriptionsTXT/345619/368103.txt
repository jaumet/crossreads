 Dear Mum This is "Tidworth House" and is a very nice house &amp; grounds, sort of "Lord of the Manor" business, this shows the front. It is just over four months (21/4/18) since we left our homes, it seems years &amp; years to me, and is only the start, I suppose, never mind, there will come a time when all this trouble will only be a memory. love from your husband.
