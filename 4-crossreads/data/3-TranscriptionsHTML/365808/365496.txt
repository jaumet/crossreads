<p><u>Flanders</u><br/><u>5-7-17</u><br/>Dear Judge<br/>I was awfully glad to get your letter of 23rd May &ndash; more especially as my letters from Australia have been few and far between of late. You are one of the most regular of my correspondents and I enjoy getting your letters more than anything.<br/>I am afraid I must have made a mistake, when I wrote you that I had seen Keith with General Holmes, when the latter came down to make some presentations. I was some distance away and seeing a tall figure with Holmes, asked <strike>if</strike> an officer near me if same was Ferguson. I know he wasn't certain about it, but thought it was &ndash; I am awfully glad to hear that Keith is better, and hopes soon all will be</p>
