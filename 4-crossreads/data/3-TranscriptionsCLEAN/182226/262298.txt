Sunday 3 October, 1915
Have been given clearance certificate which will take me off the Peninsula. I am sorry in a way because I don't like leaving my pals but I am too jolly weak to do anything.
Mac & Bernie helped me down to the beach hospital.
Mail came in today. Had a letter from Beryl & Hilda. I am very disappointed at not getting one from the Mater.
As soon as I got to the beach hospital Beachy sent a shrapnel along which splatted all over the cases that we were behind & hit one man in the arm, just a few yards away & later killed a man in swimming.
Went aboard S.S. Hospital Ship Assaye.
Had a bit of stiff luck, lost my watch, may be lucky enough to get it back.
Met Bunny Abbot & Arthur Taylor.
