<p>Sunday May 20th<br/>Raining this morning, but a fine afternoon my feet were very sore, therefore I did not go out very far. It was ten am when I got up &amp; by the time I had breakfast it was dinner time, so I put the two together. Went to a sing song &amp; lecture at the Y.M.C.A. this afternoon. They have a fine theatre here, it was quite a pleasure to sit in such comfortable chairs, &amp; the lecture was rather interesting, but the singing was very poor. Caught 10 pm train from Central Railway station for London. I forgot to say I came up by the Eastern Railway &amp; am going back by the Great Western, so I am doing the round journey.</p>
<p>Monday May 21st<br/>Arrived at Euston about 9 am being about 1 hr 40 min late. I slept fairly well coming down in the train, there were only four of us in the carriage. Went by tube to Charing Cross &amp; thence to Bow Rd per District Railway. Everybody is talking, about having a great thunder storm here last night, I believe the lightning, thunder &amp; rain was dreadful. Never went anywhere all day, but went for a walk through Victoria Park this evening.</p>
