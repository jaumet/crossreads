Left Fremantle with 10.19.1, & 3d. out of X"mas Pudding & 3 lucky 1/2d.'s surface. We drove for a couple of miles by the River Swan. We passed a banana plantation & then a grand swimming baths. These baths are about 150 yds out from the shore & over a 1/4 mile long. The W.A. swimmers hold the long distance races in the open river. A shark has never been known to tackle anybody.
We then passed on through King's Park. We saw many flowering gum trees. It is the first time I have noticed them. They are all colours of Red. Motored right down to the wharf & were aboard at 12.15 pm. We sailed again at 4.15 pm
