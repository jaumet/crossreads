<p>Is your leg quite better, I hope so.  I saw Bert Macnamara the other day &amp; he asked after you.</p>
<p>Now my dear I must flee.  I'm very homesick for you all.  I do hope the blessed war doesn't spread over another winter, it would be a terrible blow but as the opera hath it "Oh I fear it".</p>
<p>I must flee, its too cold to stay up, so I'll to bed.</p>
<p>Love to Mac, Graham &amp; the Boss &amp; yourself muchly</p>
<p>Yours as ever<br/>Jim Wilkie</p>
