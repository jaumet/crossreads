<p>had been ill. I had a letter from her from Lawson in which she said that Hal had won his exhibition. Good on him! before I forget Mother - if you see a book called &quot;With the Turks in Palestine&quot; by Alexnder Aaronson you should try and get it, as it is rather a good account of this country. I have just read it. That Kai-ora Cooee is a bit knocked about as it has been in my pocket all through the last stunt. When i first read the paper I did not care for it, but the more I read it the more I liked it and I read it a good many times. I think it shows you the state of opposites we live in. it seems always to be either a feast or a famine in one thing or another in the army. I am glad you enjoyed my 10 page letter - if I get time when we get back from this I might write you another &quot;book&quot; about Jerusalem &amp; Jericho etc. If possible please Mother, let me know if you think my photos are all getting home, and whether all the negatives coresponding to them have arrived also. There are other ways I could try of getting them home which might be safer. So you met Mrs White in Sydney - I know her husband &quot;Old Ack Ack&quot; as he is called on account of his initials being AA.. He was in charge of A Sqdn and wounded at Khew<s>h</s>elphy. I would like to meet mrs White - if we get down to Cairo.&nbsp;Am so glad Father was thinking of putting me in for one of those Warrobil blocks. I wonder if the Govt. took Cooyal.</p>
