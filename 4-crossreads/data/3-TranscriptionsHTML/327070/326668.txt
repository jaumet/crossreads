<p>that the house-boats are largely occupied by Europeans, - French &amp; British, - but I do not envy them being cooped up quarters.</p>
<p>I have noticed that 2 of the officers of the Devons (who are at present quartered here) row over each morning from one of the house-boats where their wives live.</p>
<p>We were interested in a rather small Nile boat out fishing. It has the usual flattened &amp; upward curving bow, short mast &amp; long cross spar &amp; was manned by 2 rowers sitting abreast while a third stood in the stern casting the net &amp; drawing it in. from 3 casts he did not get anything.</p>
<p>Oll read her mail (up to Feb 20th) in between times &amp; I think enjoyed the outing. We were back by 12 o'clock &amp; after an ice-cream at Groppi's I left Oll &amp; came back to barracks.</p>
<p>During the afternoon had a little excitement, one man who had been "wanted" for 9 months resisting arrest but finally being captured &amp; landed in the guard room</p>
<p>Stayed quietly in after tea.</p>
