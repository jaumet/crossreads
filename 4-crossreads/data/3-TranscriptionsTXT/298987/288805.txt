 Aug 13 of more use than appeared. Some of the other Cos had a few casualities. Did not start untill 4 PM as the day was hot it was well. Got the same Billet in Villers Brettineau but came on a much shorter road &amp; less dust. A few men got rides on empty Lorries upseting some of the Heads muchly much questioning was done but of course no one had seen anything. Much interest was also taken in our feet &amp; "Condies" issued to bath them in. The usual nightly bombs were dropped mostly at a distance Should have mentioned that marching up on Sunday saw a Hun plane bring down one of our Observation Ballons The Observers hopped out &amp; looked very quaint coming down slowly with there white parachoots. The burning baloon seemed almost to tutch them as it fell leaveing a great coloum of smoke straight behind it as there was no wind
