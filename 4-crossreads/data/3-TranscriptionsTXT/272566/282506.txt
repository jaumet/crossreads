Very cold again today.  Caught for a job - cleaning out a gutter.  News to hand that Lt. Col. Williams died last night at 9 p.m.  Party to go from this unit tomorrow to be present at his funeral.  This afternoon I was burning off rubbish.Church service in the grounds of the camp at 3 p.m.  The 5th Div. Band attended.
