<p>August 1915<br/>14th &ndash; Am going to make enquiries at H. Qrs re same. Went in for swim with him. Big shell had landed alongside of wireless stn &amp; burst two tins benzine spraying it about &amp; setting fire to same. Narrowly missed sight of Sig Troop. Clothing burnt etc. Wrote Dad &amp; Jeannie in afternoon. Brennan said W.O. had told him that Major &amp; Col wouldn't hear of any of our corps transferring except Wright. Rumoured further success on our extreme left. N.Z's advancing.<br/>15th &ndash; Heard that half hill 971 taken at very heavy cost. Turks M.G's &amp; bombs playing havoc with our troops. Indians description of shrapnel &amp; Austns rather funny. Said. One shrapnel, 'Englishmen go into dug-out, two shrapnel. Indian go into dugout Three shrapnel Austn turn round at Turks &amp; say "You &ndash;" Tommies greatly amused at description. During recent attack Maoris got Turkish H.Qrs Brownie said he visited them. Some got<br/>15th &ndash; few relics. Maoris got Eider down quilts etc. Evidently harems had been kept there as signs of womens clothing there. That night he had also been in touch with Aeroplane &amp; directing our fire. Night of 11th. our aeroplanes chased Taube over Turkish lines &amp; firing at her. Second Taube appeared &amp; so as not to be caught between two fires &amp; shrapnel, ours retired. Hair cut again. Not quite so short. Flies a nuisance. Wake everybody at daylight. Made enquiries re notice at 3rd Fld. Amb. Went up White's Gully to Administative H.Qrs. Sergt Major McCutch said only five req'd &amp; already 16 in for same. Also said they could get as many as the wanted from <indecipherable> &amp; would make no special appln for anybody. My case evidently dough. Got "Bohemian" Q.T. &amp; "Sunday Times" from Mater. Went out with stretcher squads 8pm to 8AM. Not much doing. Turks mad attack</p>
