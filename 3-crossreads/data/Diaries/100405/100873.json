The Government sent the Diggers over there and it was at the Government's behest that the boys captured the prisoners.  It is not suggested for one minute that the Government instructed the boys to \"rat\" the prisoners;  but, if it did not want the prisoners \"ratted\", it was up to the Government to prevent it.<br>\r\nHere is a letter received by \"Smith's\" which shows how seriously some of the Diggers are now taking their citizenship:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maxwelton Farm,<br>\r\nCoolgarra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Editor,<br>\r\n\"Smith's Weekly\",<br>\r\nSydney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Sir,<br>\r\nSome time back I read an interesting article in your paper of a Digger who sent some photographs back to a German soldier.<br>\r\nDuring our advance on the St. Quentin Canal I took a prisoner, and nothing would suit me better than take his photos and pay book as souvenirs.<br>\r\nBut as years roll on a person stops to think that the owner of those photos would appreciate them all the more now, so I am enclosing them so as you can send them along to their owner.<br>\r\nI do not understand German or else I would send them on myself.<br>\r\nThere was writing on most of the cards but it has disappeared for the past two years.<br>\r\nI am sure that the German soldier would quite understand that all [indecipherable ? end of the column of the press cutting torn] person would never think about doing under any other circumstances.<br>\r\nIf you are successful in getting the photos to the owner and he acknowledges same, you can use the story as I will read it in your paper.<br>\r\nHoping and trusting that this will meet with your support.<br>\r\nI am,<br>\r\nYours Faithfully<br>\r\nL.
