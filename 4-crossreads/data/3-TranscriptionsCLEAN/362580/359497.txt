  
 Went along a channel with beautiful Palm (date) plantations along its banks.  Returned to Alexandria at 6.30 p.m. just 30 minutes late to meet my little Manch. friend & there he was waiting patiently - anyhow they are friends & Cap. Combes explained how we lost our way - so made things alright - Then we went our own sweet way - had a delightful drive and to Savoy for dinner then Motor drive & reached Rest home at 10.30 p.m. 
 Have taken things easy this morning but busy writing & packing to leave here at 3.30 p.m.  Have had a glorious week altogether, lunches & dinner with different ones - Mr Cuming took me out several times, he had to go to Cairo on Friday on business.  Had dinner at Ras-el-tin convalescent home one night & a motor drive home - Dorothy & I invited there - Did I tell you that Dorothy came down last Sunday for a week, so we are all returning to-day.  She is very well & enjoying herself - not so much in love with her man - I did not think it would last, not sorry.
