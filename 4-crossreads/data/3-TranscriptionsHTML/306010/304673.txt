<p>enthusiastic encores. Although the gala did not finish until 1 a.m. , I arrived back at camp at &frac14; to <u>1</u>, not-withstanding the fact that Wimereux is some distance from the town of Boulogne. How did I do it? Very easily because 1 a.m. on 1st Oct marked the end of the summer time period and on the stroke of <u>one</u> all clocks &amp; watches <strike>here</strike> throughout France had to be put back one hour (winter time). And that is how I got back so early.<br/>The evenings get darker much quicker now of course. When we first arrived in the North it was dark about 10.30 pm. (summer time of course) but now (with the recent addition of one hour winter time) it is nearly dark at 7 p.m. and the evenings are still getting shorter of course.</p>
