<p>Flessells 7/12/16  Not a gleam of sun.  All day a raw fog hung over everything.  Drilled in the morning down near the station and in the afternoon had them all on artillery formations and attack practice.  Lewis bombers and gunners also busy.</p>
<p>8/12/16  Another raw cold day.  As it commenced to rain, sent all the men back to the billets for instruction there and let the afternoon parade also take place there.   Colonel Bridges GSO1. inspected during the afternoon.  Very nice people at the billet here they allow our men to come into their dining room and yarn etc.  Colonel Smith, N. Proudfoot and Hepburn were round during the afternoon late.</p>
<p>9/12/16  Wet again, President of a Court-Martial with Capt. McNeil and Tovode as members.  Tried one man and awarded 12 months hard labour.  Ordered afternoon parade in the billets to consist of musketry tests.  Went round the billets about 2.15 preceded by one of the runners and found them all hard at work &ndash; in some cases by candlelight, owing to the daylight failing so fast.  The streets were all slushy underfoot.  In judging distance it was found that the tendency was to overestimate a good deal.  In some of the companies there are a good many new N.C.Os  just arrived in reinforcements and most of the old men have been evacuated sick.</p>
<p>This means that a fair number of new N.C.O.'s who have never been in trenches are put in command of veterans and  of course there is a somewhat nasty feeling engendered.  It is only a phase of course.  King returned from leave.  Great preparations for our dinner tonight when all military society are dining with us in an upper room somewhere in an estaminet.</p>
