 Foot getting on well but have a queer swelling of the glands of the neck which is both painful   &  annoying as it is very difficult for me to move in bed. Dad comes in after tea  &  cheers me up a good bit. It is very queer how I look forward to seeing him. 
 1915 September 9 Thursday 
 Neck slightly easier this morning   &  I feel brighter generally. My writing can be taken as a fair guide to the state of my nerves   &  muscles. I am as weak as a kitten
