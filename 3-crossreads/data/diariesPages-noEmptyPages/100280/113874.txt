got a crack down here
7th Left here for Albert we were lucky for we struck cars got a ride right into Albert so saved us a long weary walk.
Jock I went over to Meaulte to see Len, we soon found him he was checking loads of trucks as they went through he was surprised to see Jock I, we had tea here I got some souvenirs from Len to take over, after tea we all walked back to our camp.
