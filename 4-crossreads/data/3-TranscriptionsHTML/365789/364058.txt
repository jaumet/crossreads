<p>There they were &ndash; Sydney boys, country fellows from New South Wales, our old friends just as we knew them, heavy-eyed, tired to death as after a long fight with a bush-fire, or heavy work in drought time &ndash; but just doing their ordinary Australian work in their ordinary Australian way.  And that is all they had been doing.</p>
<p>But what are we going to do for them.  The mere noise is enough to break any man's nerves.  Every one of those shrieking shells which fell night and day may mean any man's instant death.  As he hears each shell crossing he knows it.  He saw the sights around him.  He was buried by earth, and dug out by his mates, and he dug them out in turn.  What can we do for him.  I know only one thing.  It is the only allieviation that science knows of.  We can force some mitigation of all this by one means, and on alone.  If we can give the Germans worse.  The one anxiety in the mind of the soldier is &ndash; have we got the guns and the shells; can we keep ahead of them with guns and our ammunition.  That means everything.  These men have the nerve to go through these infernos provided their friends at home do not desert them.  If the munition worker could see what I have seen he would toil as though he were racing against time to save the lives of men.</p>
<p>I saw yesterday a letter picked up on the battlefield.  It was from one of our men: "Dear Mother, Sisters, Brothers, and Auntie Lill," it said, "As we are about to go into work that must be done, I want to ask you, if anything should happen to me not to worry.  You must think of all the mothers that have lost ones as dear to them.  One thing you can say, that you lost one doing his little bit for a good cause.</p>
<p>"I know you shall feel it if anything does happen to me, but I am willing and prepared to give my life for the cause."</p>
<p>Such lives hang from hour to hour on the work that is done in the British factories.</p>
<p>France,<br/>28th August.</p>
<p>It had been a wild night.  Not a first-rate full-dress attack on a big front, but one of those fierce struggles on a small front which have been so frequent on the Pozieres ridge.  Along a good part of the line the troops were back in the trenches they had left, or had dug themselves a new trench only slightly in advance of it.  At other points they were in the trenches they had gone for.  In other places still &ndash; well, nobody was quite sure.</p>
<p>The bombardment, which had been turned on as though somebody held the key to the thunderstorm, and which had crashed and flashed into the hillside nearly all the night, had gradually died down.  The artillery staff officers on both sides had long since read the last signal form, and had given instructions to cover any possible trouble, and had turned into bed.  The normal early-morning gun was sending its normal shell at intervals ranging up the long valley &ndash; rattle, rattle, rattle, until the echo died away up the slopes like that of a vanishing railway train.  As it died another gun would bark, and another, until, for a few seconds, the noise dwindled and died altogether, and there was a silence as if somebody, just for a second or two, had stopped the battle.  The German Artillery Staff had left its gun barking, too.  Every now and again the shell came and spat over the hillside.</p>
<p>The morning broke very pale and white through the mist, as though the earth were tired to death after that wild nightmare.  The soft white hand of the mist covered the red land so that you could see no more than 200 or 300 yards at most, and often not 100 yards.  We were stumbling over ground smashed in by the last night's fire &ndash; red earth new turned.  Only a few hundred yards away another fold of the land loomed out of the mist &ndash; you could see the crest rising dull grey out of the white vapour in the dip between.  That hill crest was in German territory, not ours, for which good reason we hurried to the shelter of a trench.</p>
