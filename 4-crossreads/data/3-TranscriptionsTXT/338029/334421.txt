The desert mocked at Time's Remorse,While months waxed into years.Who knows the strain that breaks the heart?With grief and loss and fears.The past has aged boys into men-And red war ages most &ndash; While conscripts cavil at sacrificeTo duty's unlaid ghost.
There's a heavy hearted laddie,Weary and worn to-day,Now in his third year battleBiding the grim fate's sway.
