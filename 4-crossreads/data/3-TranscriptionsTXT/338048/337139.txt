 a fair days work for my first day of duty for over 3 weeks. Went to bed with the news of a full day march past Bedford tomorrow 
 Friday 22nd Got ready for a big march but arrangements for taking lunch failed so all we did was a bit of a walk about 4 or 5 miles &amp; returned for dinner. 
 Afternoon was spent in having a bath &amp; getting ready to proceed on leave which had been approved. Got paid &amp; caught car to Bedford about 5.30 p.m. and found that the train for Birmingham started at 7.28 but would not arrive at Bham until about midnight when obtaining a bed would be a difficult matter. I therefore broke my journey at Leicester where I arrived at 8.30 &amp; obtained a bed at the Y.M.C.A. 
 One of our chaps has people at Leicester so he showed me around the town which was pitch dark. The measures taken against Zepps are marvellous in this respect &amp; one can almost feel the darkness. Naturally I soon returned from darkness to light at the Y.M.C.A. not before going a tram ride which was slightly amusing. I gave the conductor 1d &amp; asked her to tell me when the section was up and she then told me it was &frac12; to the terminus about 1 &frac12; miles out There soldiers travel half fare as shown on the tram ticket which I am sending home Getting a childs ticket seemed rather peculiar. 
 The beds at the Y.M.C.A. where canvas ones in the concert hall &amp; after the concert was over I got to bed arranging to be woke at 5.30.
