<p>Anyway, while over enemy lines they were all attacked by Hun machines. Brooks was brought down (shot) &amp; killed. Vautin, was going good, but got his propeller shot off, &amp; a control shot away, (this was happening at about 8,000 ft.) &amp; he crashed, but was not hurt himself. In the meantime the "recco" machine (Potts) had got away, after a running fight. Poor old Brooks plane had collapsed at a height of about 7,000 owing to being "shot up" by the enemy, &amp; he went down like a stone.</p>
