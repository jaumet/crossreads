<p>January, 1917. 2nd after Epiphany. Sunday 14<br/>Set out as usual at 8. Not so cold but very foggy. Unloaded the usual pontoons and at 3 got a note from Bolton per drivers telling me to meet Mr Price's party at 5.30 to show them the forward dump. Turned up at 6 and found dump as expected at 7 On way home fell in mud at Road Crossing in the Delville. Returned wet miserable tired and hungry at 8 and soon after a good meal turned in dirty. Phenomenally quiet artillery all day. Infantry party of 10 from 52nd Batt growling as usual.</p>
