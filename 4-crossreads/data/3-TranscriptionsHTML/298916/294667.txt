The females carry baskets of coal to the railway trucks whilst the men sit down &amp; smoke. Quaint old barges move slowly about the transports &amp; "bum-boats" as usual are plentiful. Cingalees row out in their boats &amp; for a trifling sum they do washing that is a credit to some done in our cities. Two Cingalees rowed out amongst the transports but were turned away.</p>
