Very nice day - very cold- Our floating home is rolling & knocking things about. Plenty to eat at the tables. Canteen Day - unfortunately doing a roaring trade - took 50 first day of opening - sell somewhere about 300 lbs of Biscuits & 200 pkts of sweets etc per day. All men were called together & were lectured by Officers on the necessity of avoiding smoking between Decks on account of Fire, as we are a couple of hundred miles from shore. My Badge &Stripes obtains for me many concessions in regards to coming & going to any part of the Ship, which is only an Officers privilege - some times see a little too much.
