 27 April 1918 Saturday Our 60 lbs Howitzers V Krupp all the morning. Madeba Troop got in with 3 Horses killed 3 men wounded. Rumours that we are really to be relieved soon but no leave yet for me- " Many pity women who knew it all before you" &amp; is rough on the wife.  We got a 28 bore Shotgun but cartridges are loaded with shrapnel bullets so not much use on Partridge-   The men use shrapnel to play marbles with after a scrap has scattered some about, splendid ammunition for Shanghais
