<p>The Ptes Lament</p>
<p>Now Im going to tell a little tale<br/>About this army Grand<br/>Where the bread and Bully always<br/>Stale<br/>And the cheese it beats the band<br/>Its fixed by cooks who know<br/>The Game<br/>From ABC to Z<br/>The Privates always get the<br/>Same<br/>The good dope for the heads<br/>For the Capt he gets Poultry<br/>The Major he gets duck<br/>The Colonel gets a little wine<br/>With a little bit of luck<br/>The Batman gets the leavings<br/>The Cooks a little ham<br/>While all the poor old Private gets is bread<br/>And [dash] jam</p>
