<p>from the Turk onto the flying birds.  Only two managed to fall in our lines &amp; were immediately picked up &amp; laid by for use.  My comrade over the way was a lucky number &amp; he &amp; his staff have been busy during the afternoon plucking &amp; otherwise preparing the bird for the pot.  I am in hopes of being a guest for dinner at his dugout tonight, provided the Turkey is produced.  Another &amp; more animated scene prevails near the canteen.  The home mail has arrived &amp; during the sorting period a crowd always assembles in hopes of news.  The soldier is always busy with his news bag on this event full day &amp; must on no occasion be disturbed in his lair.  After a day it might be wise to approach &amp; request the loan of various reading material &amp; thus the various contributions go the rounds.  It is a generous feeling &amp; provides good comradeship as many a poor chap gets neither letter or paper &amp; to them mail day is neither a pleasure or otherwise.  Our good luck appears phenomenal today as we also have an issue of cigarettes, matches, and tobacco.  As these are absolute essential &amp; luxury, you can imagine our feeling at receiving such a collection of godsends all in the one day.</p>
