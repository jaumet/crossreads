<p>oclock we left Debabis for Oghratina with our mouths parched &amp; dry;  The Turks have made small wooden troughs for watering horses &amp; all the wells have been cleaned out &amp; a good supply of salty water, but it is too salty for men to drink</p>
<p>10-8-16<br/>Thurs 10th<br/>Arrived at Oghratina late last night &amp; dropped to sleep till daylight &amp; some fantasies of water were brought on the scene &amp; we soon made a hole in them, &amp; filled our bottles, then mounted &amp; went about half a mile south of Oghratina to a Hod with several good wells, here we watered our horses &amp; then went to Hod-El-Negliat between Qatia &amp; Oghratina, were issued with rations &amp; slept all day</p>
