<p>Owing to the crowd on board proper sleep was out of the question.   We landed at Cape Helles about 2.30 A.M. &amp; after half an hours walk dropped our kits &amp; turned in on mother earth.   On our way we saw the remains of the "Majestic" the Hull sticking up about 6 ft like a huge well.   Our landing place was a pier made of barges alongside the "River Clyde" the ship run ashore during the landing &amp; we viewed with interest the signs of the bombardment, trenches etc.  There were vast quantities of stores everywhere.   I managed to get 4 hours sleep during that night, of a kind.</p>
<p>Monday 28th</p>
<p>Hauled out from our slumbers about 6 A.M. &amp; marched a few hundred yards to the No 11 Clearing Hospital Station.   We were given till 11 A.M. to prepare our dugouts during which I worked like a nigger preparing my abode.   Then we were told off to stretcher work, unloading motors, wagons etc &amp; conveying wounded to the pier for embarkation on the Hospital ship, particularly hard work.   About 9 P.M. orders came for 20 men to go &amp; help the Ghurkas as they were deadbeat &amp; volunteers were called for I chipped in although I don't quite know why as I was dead beat &amp; was preparing</p>
