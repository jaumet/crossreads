A few days ago I had a letter from Mrs Bacon, of The Astor Macquarie St., telling me that she is coming to Cairo, and asking me for information. She thinks that she has two boys - sons - somewhere in these parts. She comes by the Maloja. I asked, by letter, Mrs Newmarch to meet her & look after her. I am sure that she will do so.
How long shall I be here?8. p.m.: On looking through your envelope I see that the sheets for you taken together form a respectable letter, which I hope may be pleasing to you.
When my movements are decided upon I shall jot some more words down and send them after this.
Meanwhile I shall conclude by asking you to give to all my friends my best wishes & regards, & to accept for yourselves heaps of love & loads of kisses. From my Kitty no letter has come for a long time, perhaps midst the gaities of Cesnock she forgot all about a P. O. M. far away across the world. Naughty Kitty dear.
Your affectionate & loving fatherJohn B. Nash
