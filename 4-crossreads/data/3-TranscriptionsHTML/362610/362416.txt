<p>Wednesday 19 July 1916<br/>A clear day, inclined to be muggy after the rain, &amp; hot in the afternoon. Expecting orders all day &amp; so more or less on the qui vive. Just before lunch was delighted to see Rid coming along : he had come into Warloy from his camp in the Vadencourt wood in order to buy some things for their mess, &amp; had been directed to my billet by DeWinton. From Rid learned that Leo was close by &amp; well. Much enjoyed the yarn with Rid. About 4.15 in the afternoon we got word to move out at 4 &amp; after a big scramble got under way, having a tremendous rush to catch up with the rest of the Bn.  Halted outside Albert, close to a battery of 9.2 guns, for a spell for tea &amp; then marched through the town with its famous leaning image on the church again halting on the far side on Tara Hill. Much interested in Tommy battalions coming back with German trophies. At dusk moved up to the front line in front of Pozieres &amp; took over from the Northumberland Fusiliers, finishing the taking over about 1 o'clock.</p>
