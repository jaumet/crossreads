Finished book Lost Prince.  All sisters more or less paired off in groups. None appeal to me as a friend in the future but no matter, must "carry on" by oneself as per usual.  Must be getting nearer the western side of Australia now.  Sun rises directly behind boat, sets straight in front as though we were going right into the heart of the sunset. Wireless rec'd states that Russia contemplates separate peace with Germany.  If so our outlook for end of war is dim.  So the days go by.  Our cabin reported tidiest of the crowd!
