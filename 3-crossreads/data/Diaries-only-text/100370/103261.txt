was made to put Groppi's Tea Rooms out of bounds to troops but the proprietor took a firm stand on the question, declaring that he would close it to the Military altogether if soldiers were excluded. Why should these attempts be made to close every decent place to Soldiers and keep them exclusively for men who happen to wear a star or two on their shoulders.
