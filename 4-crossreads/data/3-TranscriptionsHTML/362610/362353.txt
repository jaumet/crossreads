<p>Wednesday 17 May 1916<br/>A dull morning but a gloriously fine day, - absolutely perfect. A second draft of men, this time accompanied by 10 or 12 officers went up to the front.<br/>Company parade in the morning broke into my letter writing for the outward Australian mail. In the afternoon went over to the trenches on the training ground for practice in the relief of trenches, getting back to camp about 7.30. A beautiful sunset. An aeroplane showing the Allies' colours flew over the camps in the afternoon &amp; caused some excitement by dropping 2 smoke bombs, possibly for practice purposes.<br/>Outward mail for Aust.</p>
