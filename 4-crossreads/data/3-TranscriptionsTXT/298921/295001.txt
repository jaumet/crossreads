 January, 1915 Thursday 28 At "Suez", [indecipherable] barracading the Bridge &amp; wheel house with Bags of Oats as "snipers" line the Canal to have a pot shot at Steamers as they pass if conveying Troops. Will endeavour to post at Alexandria on arrival. Saturday. Among my Pictures at [indecipherable] was a colored photo of a steamer 'in' the Canal I think both banks look like the backcountry after a drought!! As the boats go along, from the harbour, they have the appearance of steaming across a sandy plain the entrance not being visible from where we lie at anchor.
