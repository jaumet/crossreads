Mar. 5th: - Left tunnel & went by Eaucourt Abbey & Clarke's Dump to "A" Camp Bazentin-le-Grand & slept at huts for night: It looks as if  y  we are finished with Le Barque & its "Yellow-Cut" & "Blue-Cut" Roads its' "Misty corner", "Cough-Drop" & "Factory Corner" for a time. Bn. Hqrs were at Wheat Trench - I wonder who chooses the names for the christenings of all these points of reference.
