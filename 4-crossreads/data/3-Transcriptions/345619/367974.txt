<p>My Dearest Woof<br/>I was very glad to get another bundle of letters from you the other day, and some sums and I think you have come on to be able to do those sums like you sent me, and I can see you will be able to keep all my accounts when I get home and start farming again, and Frank will have to learn to do some thing too to help</p>
