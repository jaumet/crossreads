1916   SATURDAY 24   JUNE
A beautiful warm calm day & the sea as smooth as a mill pond. We had a buzzer lecture in the morning and we had a concert in the afternoon. The concert was very good. It was great to look at the great Crowd of men huddled up together all as happy as "sandboys" and the sun shining on the sea in the background & never knowing what minute we may be sunk by a torpedo. I often wonder when I see the men gathered together like that how many will come back whole.
