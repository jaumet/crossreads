<p>round there I went but one patient was a suspect for meningitis which caused a general disturbance both in the camp I brought him from &amp; my crowd.  They examined him but would not take him in so had to run him to "Estairs".  After much argument they took him in &amp; I got back for tea about 8.30 P.M.  Altogether a very busy day &amp; an interesting one.</p>
<p>Tuesday 22nd August<br/>Orderly Sergeant for the day.  Had to attend the court martial of one of our chaps &amp; spent most of the day at the court &amp; was not called at all.  Did nothing but wait &amp; wait for hours.  Had a little fun going down.  Two of us got a lift in the Generals car &amp; passed the officers down the road who were walking to the Court, they thought it a great joke for us to ride in the car &amp; asked me when I ordered it.  Had a few bright hours at night.  We started for a long walk &amp; cracked enough champagne to make us feel happy.  After the tattoo &amp; reading of orders we had a "gas alert" come along &amp; I had to warn all the chaps in the billet</p>
