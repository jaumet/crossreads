DIARYCommencing Jan 1st 1918From Old Diary.Jan 1st/18. Tues.
Marked day in Stone. Very quiet to what it was in the old days. Went into Sale Yard with Ern Harvey, but all the stock was gone, although it was only about 2 pm. At night Mrs Sam & Jenny & I went to a Whist Drive at St Michael's Institute. Met crowds that I knew. None of us won a Prize, but it was a most enjoyable night.
Wed. 2Went to Pantomime at Theatre Royal, Hanley. "Tommy Tucker". It was rotten. Had Tea and Supper at Pat Astbury's.
Thur. 3Went to Burslem with Mrs Sam, Harry and Fanny. Had dinner at Harry Ibb's place then bade them "Hooray" and returned to Stowe. Met Mr Sockett on Stowe Station, also met Mrs Bailey from Tillensor.
