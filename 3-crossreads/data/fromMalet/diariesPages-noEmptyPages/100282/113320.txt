it all round, we get so used to the steady "plonk" of them that we take little or no notice, gas shells are easily told from others for there is scarcely any noise, they have just a small charge of explosive about enough to crack the shell, this is all that is wanted for the gas inside which is in liquid form immediately starts to vaporize so liberates the gas, but it takes a tremendous lot of shells to do much damage anyone who knew nothing about these shells would say "what a lot of duds old Fritz is putting over tonight", for that is what they sound like, he is at the same game tonight is slinging them over in dozens, a lot of them are landing quite close too, there has been a couple of alarms but the "all clear" signal was given after a few minutes in each case, our guns are still hammering away at Fritz waves of drumfire burst out every now again like as if you lifted the lid off Hell."
