 12 Thursday 
 Dropped anchor in Navarino about 9 o'clock a.m. I stayed in my bunk to escape parade &amp; was tired as Russell &amp; Lindsay kept me up late as they played cards &amp; sister smoked incessantly. Left at usual hour in evening. Tired of Capt. Sutherland &amp; Dr Waldron at our table. Ground swell made me sick for a while. Miss Scott Russell also sick. Had a wild headache but it passed.
