Am acting Orderly Sergt for Johnny Nicholson this morning4 of us went for a good long walk this afternoon as far as Winterbourne Stoke a small little village but very pretty, I love rambling about these old roads & villages, we take our time & spell whenever we feel inclined in the shade of the old trees along the roads or lanes, & the flowers are splendid just now which makes the strolls all the more pleasant. Had our tea in a little cottage before leaving, & we walked quietly back in the cool of the evening, you could see my cubicle now, I have got her fixed up nicely, every day I have fresh flowers on my table for they are very plentiful at present
