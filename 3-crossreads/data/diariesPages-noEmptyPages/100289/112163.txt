on that part of the line.
Sunday 20.8.16
Nothing to relate; spent a very quiet day:
Monday 21.8.16
Received another parcel from home containing photographic material. Heavy thunderstorm during night; days getting much shorter mornings cold.
Tuesday 22.8.16 to Saturday 26.8.16.
Nothing unusual to relate. Rained practically the whole of the time on off. Large number of admissions, mostly Tommies from the Somme who certainly require a spell.
Sunday 27.8.16
Played cricket against a team of Tommies. Wicket very much against batting, scored only 2 out of 30 made by the side,
