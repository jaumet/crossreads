  
 Wed. Mar 5 (cont) The Carnival last night was a "wash out" as the Diggers refused to take any interest in it. Thur. Mar 6. The Diggers are getting tired of the trip & today they are holding meetings all over the place & airing their grievances most of which are imaginary. Since leaving Colombo we have travelled very slowly. The new crew that signed on are not yet settled down to their Job, so I suppose we won't be hurrying up for a while. Things are fairly busy in Hospital. Plenty of malaria cases, but, happily, none very serious. The Diggers are holding a Concert on their own tonight without any assistance from the Heads. Played Poker for a couple of hours & lost 2 bob. Fri. Mar 7. It rained heavily last night & early this morning, & when I woke up I discovered water flapping round my feet. I hopped out quick and lively & had a Bath and put my Blankets out to dry. Had Salt Ling for Breakfast which was anything but nice. 9 of our patients were discharged this morning. We got 3 new ones in, so now we only have 8 patients, but I guess our Hospital will soon fill up again. One chap, named Jones, came in very bad. It appears he has been eating Cocoanut since leaving Colombo, & it has upset the working order of his [indecipherable]. Postle & I had quite a busy time with him for about a couple of Hours. After Tea the Head Sister gave us a severe lecture, so I wouldn't be at all surprised to receive the Order of the Boot at an early date.
