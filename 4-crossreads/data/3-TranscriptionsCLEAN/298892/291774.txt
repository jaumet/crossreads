  
 hands and chatted with any of the men who cared to approach him. He had a crowd of them around him just outside our tent and had I the least idea that you would be likely to see him I would have made myself known to him. He seems a very affable man and soon made himself at home with the men and had them raking up their numerous souvenirs for his inspection. I am glad to hear of Emma's success in musical circles but I am afraid her figure will prove a severe handicap to her. Sylvia Bremer has flashed to the fore and I daresay I will be admiring her on the films before long. I don't like writing about the war or my own experiences at the front as I know you are quite anxious enough about my welfare as it is, and constant reference to the risks and dangers which anyone at the front must encounter will only serve to heighten your anxiety. Still I must say that, from what I can see around me here at the front, there is now no doubt whatever that we are on the high road to victory, and I will be surprised if the Hun is not driven out of the whole of Belgium by the time this reaches you. The morale of the enemy troops is entirely broken and now that the number of our guns and stock of shells are almost unlimited, they cannot be brought to face our destructive barrages. I doubt if there are any troops in the world who could stand up to the perfect deluge of shells which preceed all our attacks. When our infantry follow on after the barage they find the remaining huns shattered in nerves, as white as death, and trembling in every limb. All thought of resistance has been scared out of them, and many rush to meet our men with their arms extended above their heads and crying for mercy. Well, I believe the end will be in sight by Xmas and I fervently pray that it may. I must close now as we have received orders to move back to the trenches first thing in the morning. With best of love to all at home and next door Your loving son Eugene.
