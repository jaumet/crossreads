<p>this going for hours, and at a merry speed all the time.</p>
<p>May. 17.   At 9 this morning we left Fricourt in order to retire further behind the line for a rest.   Of course we did not expect this so soon but the Battn. has had a lot of hard work lately &amp; deserve all they can get in the way of "holidays".   Being on guard, we acted as escort to the nine prisoners whom we had and as such followed in the rear of the Battn. as far as the Rest Camp at Senlis.   We passed La Boisselle and Buizencourt on the way and put up in huts &amp; billets at Senlis for the night.   We were given leave there during the afternoon and evening.   Alan &amp; I visited several coffee houses here &amp; imbibed of this favourite French drink.   We then walked along to the villages of Hedauville &amp; Forceville and did likewise at both places.</p>
