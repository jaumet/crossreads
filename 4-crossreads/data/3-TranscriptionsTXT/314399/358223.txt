 Thursday 14 August 1919 Nice breeze today. Read most of the day, but gee I'm some unsettled. Can't be bothered reading for long. Must go for a walk somewhere. Was in for two sweeps  today &amp; won both. Brought in &pound;3.16.0. Not at all bad. Do me. Had a fancy dress ball tonight. Gee its some fun. Some of the costumes were good. 
 Friday 15 August 1919 Quite cold today. The fancy dress people had their photos taken. Some of the costumes were rough. Particularly the colonels &amp; one or two diggers. Had pillow fighting today. Some of the fancy costumes had a try too. An officer had a good civvy suit pinched last night. This is the third lot. It appears a digger went into the cabin locked the door &amp; passed out the suit thro the port &amp; then got thro himself. All officers were inoculated against flu this afternoon
