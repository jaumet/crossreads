it was decided to take the Railway Living Vans back from St Jean to M13 at Reigersberg Nth camp there, so I put my kit out also a stretcher I brought with me went over to the vans with my Mates soon was fixed up, after notifying the Lieut of my arrival who was at St Jean I was told to await further instructions, there were only 3 stretchers occupied by our men I soon put mine in also my mate. I brought with me rations for 3 days ending Saturday. After I had Tea orders came down that I was to start at 16 oclock on Friday at St Jean on the Shtr. As we are about 1 mile from St Jean we have to walk to fro unless our Engines are unable to come down for us to change over or a Train is going up or down, anyhow my Mate myself walked up at 16 oclock took over at 16.30, there is not much work for two Engines but they must be there under steam for several reasons one
