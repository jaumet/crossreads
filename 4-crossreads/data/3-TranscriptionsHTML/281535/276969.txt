<p>22/5/19<br/>London<br/>Went into Victoria again about 5 and had a look at Westminster Cathedral which is vast but like an enormous barn. When it is marble lined it will be wonderful. Went to some gardens facing Buckingham Palace &ndash; they were very pretty. This is a fine stretch here &ndash; good streets and open spaces with statuary. Returned to Paddington changed into uniform and then went to Covent Garden Royal Opera. The Opera House is a vast ugly theatre miles behind Cologne even and not within imagination of Paris. Saw "Therese" and "A Pagliacci" played and the performances were superb. The audience claps when the conductor of the orchestra comes into his little desk. Neither of the performances was in English. After tubed right out to Paddington at once and got to bed after midnight. Meeting my trunk from Cooks is like seeing an old friend.</p>
