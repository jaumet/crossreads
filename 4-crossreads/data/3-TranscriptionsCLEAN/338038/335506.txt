 Dear Mr Garling Many thanks for yours of the 5th   I am as pleased as I know you are to have this information from Head Quarters.  I know Terence deserved fully all the good things said of him.  It should be a happy relief to your mind, that news you had, had not been lost sight of by those in Command in France. The weather is keeping very dry all over the state.  We are going to the station to night to see Charlie passing through he has been out West. With kindest regards I am yours truly P.C. Trebeck
