A fine sunny day. First event after getting up was a visit from the General who had little new to say. Took a turn in the garden. The trees are much barer but there are still enough autumn leaves left to make the view down to the Somme a very pleasant one indeed. The war news today is good and tells of the Huns being allowed 72 hours to conclude an armistice. Later a telephone message arrived from GHQ to say the Kaiser had abdicated and the Kronprinz did not want his job. Jack rode over from Vause and we had a long yarn before dinner about après la guerre and plans for the future. The education scheme promises to take up a great deal of our time in the days yet to come. In the air tonight is frost.
