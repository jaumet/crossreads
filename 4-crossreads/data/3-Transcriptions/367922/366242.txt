<p>B.R. see over<br/>I<br/>"Denegully," Northcote Road,<br/>Lindfield, 18th. September, 1917.</p>
<p>L/Cpl. E. K. Burke,<br/>Moore Park, Sydney,</p>
<p>Dear Sir,<br/>Thanks very much for your note of yesterday. Yes, I am the father of Alan Fry, whose grave in France is mentioned by Bruce Rainsford. We know exactly where Alan lies, because his elder brother, Dene Fry, visited the place and sent us a plan of the village cemetery at Warloy where he died and was interred. But all the same it was very kind of your friend to mention the matter, as all little references of this kind are valuable to relatives.</p>
<p>Though I have not the pleasure of your personal acquaintance, my family tell me that you are probably the Burke who lived in Killara and knew both Dene and Alan Fry. I think they both went to school with Bruce Rainsford (whose father I have known for many years), at any rate it is evident that Bruce remembers Alan, and if you are writing him perhaps you will be kind enough to convey to him my thanks for mentioning my son's resting place.</p>
<p>Yours, with best wishes,<br/>A.F.</p>
