<p>Friday 28 July 1916<br/>Brigade left at 2 a.m. for Katia where outposts came in touch with Enemy.  At times it looked as though we would have to fall back, but the Day passed as usual.  3 New Z. were killed &amp;amp; 3 of our men namely Collins, Mulholland, Smith were wounded.<br/>8 Prisoners were taken.<br/>The Aryshire Artillary poured about 200 Shells into the Enemy's position with good results.<br/>A premature Shell burst close to Col. Fuller, but did no damage.  We returned to Camp about 9 p.m.  Lieu. Pearce &amp;amp; Tooth were left out as listening posts.</p>

Body of Lieu. Pearce was found &amp;amp; a sledge was sent to convey the remains into Camp.  (Shot through Heart.)  The 3 men who accompanied Him on the Officers night Patrol are still missing their names being Dunbar, Thorne, Waygood.<br/>Poor old Norman Pearce was an unassuming Officer with very little Personality, but His Heart was stout &amp;amp; true.  He accepted His Duties willingly &amp;amp; in the hour of Danger never flinching to do His part.  Being one of the Senior Officers of this Regiment, work was given into His charge which needed nerve &amp;amp; endurance, &amp;amp; He rose to the occasion each time, &amp;amp; did it well.<br/>Later.
