 Tuesday 27 
 Left camp in afternoon & went to Victoria Barracks. 
 Still no pay & 30/- running very short. 
 Managed somehow & slept in Guard Room. 
 A gentleman arrived & tried to pass the sentry.  Said he wanted to enlist but the time of night (11 p.m.) was suspicious. Scant courtesy from guards and rightly. Took things high handedly at first & and spoke of having seen officer, who told him to call 
 Put in cell for the night
