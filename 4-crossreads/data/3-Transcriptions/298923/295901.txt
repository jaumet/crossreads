<p>23 August 1918 Friday (X to X crossed out)<br/>X Letters from the wife say alls well, she is moving to the same pension as Mrs Cuth Fetherstonhough is in so will be among friends. X<br/>Here we are camped in a very old Roman village &ndash; OASIS   Banana trees &amp; Lemons grown by irrigation from a stone aqueduct years old.  No living soul about, only lizards.  Jacko can shell us but so far has been very decent.  The Times report of our recent scrap says Jacko thought we were all sick.  X Very glad to hear from Laura Joe has arrived safely-   No skin trouble at present. X</p>
