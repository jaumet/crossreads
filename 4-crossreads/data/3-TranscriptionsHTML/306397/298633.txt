<p>12/9/14<br/>No unusual occurrence . Our little kittens are growing up nicely. They are charming little creatures. The first, a black one, has been named "Byasan",<br/>the second "King Lud", the third "Lovat" and the fourth "Indus" They are all petted in the mess. The 1st officer especially is very fond of them. "Now give me King Lud"</p>
