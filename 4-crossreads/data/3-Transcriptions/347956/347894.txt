<p>Sun 21st<br/>Fell in for Church Parade at 9.30 this morning &amp; enjoyed a very good sermon;  Writing all the afternoon &amp; decided to take a stroll to Heliopolis after tea with Fletcher &amp; made our way to Luna Park &amp; experimented with skates.  I did not shape too bad considering it was the first time I've had them on for 4 years  We arrived back in camp at 8.30;  Fletcher had to be back to feed up at 9 oclock</p>
