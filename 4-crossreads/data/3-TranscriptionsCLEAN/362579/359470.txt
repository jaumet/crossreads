  
 all I can   &  have my clothing etc fixed up - shall  give dear old mother plenty of mending etc. Hope the 'Phone is on. We will all have a really jolly time   &  hope the weather is good that dear mother   &  the family can have some picnics. Oh, I'm quite excited when I think of it. 
 sometimes the boat takes 12 weeks to get to Aussie. Hope we go through the Panama Canal. 
 Give my love to all my friends   &  hope they are all well. 
 Fondest love   &  kisses to you all   &  hope you are all well. 
 Heaps of joy, luck   &  good health for the New Year. 
 From Yours lovingly Edith
