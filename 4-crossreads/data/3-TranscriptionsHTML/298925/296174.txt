<p>First few days we, as stretcher bearers, had medical lectures while the men in the ranks did trench work.  On wednesday and thursday We attacked and took trenches as in real war conditions.</p>
<p>On Friday General Birdwood came to see our work to see if he thought we were fit to relieve the 2nd Division</p>
<p>An attack was made on a line of trenches with aeroplanes and under artillery fire, Light bombs etc.  I was put in charge of "C" Co SB's and at each charge we had about 20 casualties to deal with.  We were complimented and assured a speedy departure for France.</p>
<p>14th  Back in camp  "Thank Goodness"</p>
<p>End of No (2)</p>
