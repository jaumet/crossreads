Voices From Home.
Though I hear but tongues of a foreign people& I list to sounds that are strange & newClear as a silver bell in a steepleCome voices from home so fond & trueI sit at times when the leaves are fallingAlone with my thoughts as I sit today& listen to voices from homeland callingCalling so sweetly Ah! Could I but obey
& so there is no sting to death& grave has lost its victoryTis but a crossing - with bated breath& white set face - a little strip of seaTo find our loved ones waiting on the shoreMore beautiful more precious than before
