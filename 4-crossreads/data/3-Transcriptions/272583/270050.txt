<p>that I lost my way for a while. It was impossible to see 2 yds in front.<br/>Rode over to the pyramids during the afternoon and round the sphinx. Had my fortune told by arab for 2 piastres (5d). He is right in one thing only all the rest was wrong.<br/>18th<br/>Still misty. Up at 4 am, very heavy day. Horses broken into harness and waggons. <br/>Called out of bed at 8 pm to saddle up &amp; patrol main guard, back at eleven. Very tired.<br/>19th<br/>As usual misty. Natives very unruly and lazy. It took some time to get them to work. <br/>Met Reg Passo from Lane Cove, Sydney. He came with the 4th Battalion Infantry. Great surprise on both sides.<br/>Mail in. None for me worse luck. Went into Cairo to register and post some views.<br/>All the city was ablaze with lights and decorated with flags  the Union Jack &amp; French Flag being most prominent. The Imperial Force's military band was playing on the verandah of the Continental Hotel. There will be a grand celebration to-morrow (Sunday)  The New Sultans birthday.<br/>Returned to camp at 11 pm after a fairly good night.<br/> </p>
