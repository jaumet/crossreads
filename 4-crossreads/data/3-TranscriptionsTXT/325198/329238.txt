9 February, 1916We left early & I had a lively ride home as the mare knew that she was homeward bound & was anxious to get on, we had several little quarrels on the way & I think we were about even on it. We got paid during the afternoon & as there was a pass to spare I took advantage of it & went into Cairo.  I received some letters before going in & some more when I got back - nearly all the boys were full on it & when I got back there was trouble brewing. One of the pickquet got drunk & was put in the gaurd tent & the Corporal of the pickquet was also put under arrest - They are treating old Beuzeville rotten, they had one Corporal to many in the Squadron & told him that his promotion was not confirmed so he had to revert to the ranks & Corp Cameron came into the troop.
