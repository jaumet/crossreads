 Dear Dad, This is a group of the Donkeys that we hire on a short trip. They are lovely to ride &amp; are not the Jibs that our Australian Donkeys are. This Cairo is a city of colours &amp; this picture is very natural as to  Colours. Some of the Donkeys are beautiful animals ad they will jog all day without turning a hair. They are of every colour under the sun but the pure white ones are the best.  Have not been across one since our long 5 hours ride. We are both well &amp; Hope to hear that you are all well too.
