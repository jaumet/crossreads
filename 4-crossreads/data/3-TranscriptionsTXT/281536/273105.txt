 24/7/19 Chemnitz 
 A dull blowy but warm day. About the latitude of St Helena and we get a good daily budget of wireless from Ascension. Eve on promenade deck the Diggers Parliament met and discussed White Australia some good speeches. Today a whale was seen spouting by some. 
 25/7/19 Received a wireless from [?] Cape Town that we can grant leave there. A windy dull day. After lunch there was a kit inspection but it received by 2 Coys who went on strike &amp;  gave them to understand I did not care a -------- if they paraded or not so the thing fell flat and I secured my ends by putting them on their honor to hand in their surplus gear which they did. The less men have to do the less they want to.
