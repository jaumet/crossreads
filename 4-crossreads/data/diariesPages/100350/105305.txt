12th The lads working hard all night strengthening our position against attack, The usual snipeing indulged in at daybreak, time to catch the Turks carrying water to their trenches. Turkish artillery fire a few shrapnell shells over our position this morning, I was in the act of putting a clip of cartridges into the magazine of rifle, when a bullet went clean through Of course had to get another magazine form damaged rifle. The S.W.B.s Regt did some good work on our left this evening. Turk artillery from "Anafarta" fired on one of our warships that came rather close inshore and drove her off. They also shelled a mule train bringing our supplies from the beach, there was a great slaughter among men and animals, also stretcher-bearers and wounded who were making their way towards the dressing station were blown to atoms. I passed by on my way after water late in the afternoon, the sights were indescribable. Several parties out to night burying the dead.
13th Heavy artillery duel on this morning. Tommies dropping out of ranks for want of water. Turkish snipers picking our men off when going for water. Fighting still goes on all along the line, great carnage on 971 large numbers of dead Turks and some of our own lads lying in front of our own lines, stench very sickening. Went into fireing line at 7.30P.M. (received letter from home very cheering.) everything pretty quiet until about midnight when they got real joyfull.
