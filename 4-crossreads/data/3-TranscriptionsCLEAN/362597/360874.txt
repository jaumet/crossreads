  
 I had put my boots & leggings on for a fortnight. I was slipping all over the wet deck & down the stairs. If you slip on the stairs you go right to the bottom because the boat is generally rolling that way. 
 I had a very lazy afternoon & at night we all went to the sacred concert in F Ward. There were only a few of the Nurses & Doctors & Capt Moreau sang a very good song. 
 We have had a very strong N.E. breeze for the last few days & I can tell you that you have to tuck your blankets round you at night. 
 Monday 17.1.16 (26) Took the job of cleaning knives & forks to-day. I miss a parade
