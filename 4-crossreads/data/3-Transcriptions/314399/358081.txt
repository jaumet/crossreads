<p>Tuesday 25 March 1919<br/>Got up today. Too cold in bed.  Leg improving. Got 5 letters &amp; answered them. Went for a stroll (about 150). Very cold today. Voice is still gone. Am going back to my unit in a day or so. Was told today Three new officers have come down here for duty so it relieves us. Do me.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26 March 1919<br/>Went to Mountivilliers. Wrote letters &amp; played Gutzers &amp; Rummy. Had an offer today of going to Blighty tomorrow &amp; Aussie on the p.t. Turned it down Cos I want 6 months in Blighty first. Can get Aussie then.  Quite easily.</p>
