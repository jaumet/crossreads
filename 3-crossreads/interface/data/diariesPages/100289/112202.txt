Friday 1.12.16
Very cold night, icicles hanging from everything. Never had a wink of sleep. General Mackay passed here on a visit towards the line early this morning. Fritz straffed front line very heavily at about 7 pm, all very anxious to get away from this sector. Had very narrow squeak during morning; large piece of H.E. whizzed within an inch of my head, which happened to be minus a steel helmet landed at my feet.
Saturday 2.12.16
Going all night. Fritz caught 29th Btn changing over inflicted a great number of casualties. Another sleepless night. Relieved early owing to the heavy time we have had during the past two days, again very cold.
