This afternoon two of us went to Le Portel a fishing village on the other coast the other side of Boulonge where the quaint dress of the villagers is quite interesting. A local patois (different from the one that of Southern France of course) is spoken among these people. I believe they do not intermarry with strangers & rigidly preserve their customs. A fine panoramic view of the town, river Liane, harbour etc. is obtained on the way out. We passed through Le Portel & continued along the cliffs looking in at the Signal Station & Fort on Cape d'Alprecht when the obliging French navel men explained everything to us. A return was made along a broad stretch of beach at the foot of the cliffs, past a big British ammunition depot and the busy docks.The day before yesterday there
