  
 Suvla first and it was a crisp nice trip. I was tired & slept most of the time. Were off to Anzac & arrived about 12.30 & waited patiently for a Horse barge top come out to tranship our stores to. Unfortunately they were all engaged & only small Pinnaces came & a few cases were taken ashore. I made a bid to get a few on only got 7 on & those I took ashore & left Eltham with the others - the Trawler having to back again to Imbros at her usual starting time. The fatigue party was waiting & I had a little tea with McLaren (Lowland Bty) & left cases with Ammunition Party. I went along to Olly Gunderson to arrange to get some coal put on wagon we passed along
