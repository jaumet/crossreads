The one that had my platoon today wore a "window in his eye " ; but he seem a decent sort of chap . It pour rain all day . 13/5/16 . We are all sick and tire of this ceaseless train , and there is no indic of a move to the trench as yet , though all the fellow are in the pink of condit . There is a detent camp near here ; where I saw men undergo the punish known as " Crucifict " . They are strap to a beam with their arm stretch
