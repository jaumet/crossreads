<p>Tuesday 9th October 1917</p>
<p>Changed <strike>trains</strike> Engines at <strike>MODERN</strike> on the border after passing through MONT CENIS Tunnel. This tunnel takes half an hour to go through, &amp; the scenery is very good.</p>
<p>Had breakfast at <strike>MONT MELIAN</strike> with the Alps all around us &ndash; cold but interesting. Changed LIRES into Francs &ndash; fortunately the Railway is the same guage &amp; we have not to change our carriages.</p>
