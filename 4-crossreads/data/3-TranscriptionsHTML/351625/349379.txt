<p>this.  After I finish leave I expect I will do a month or so in camp before going back to France.  I am hoping there wont be much fighting left to do by the time I do get back but one cant tell.  I wouldent be the least supprised to see Germany coming to terms any day, yet still it may linger on well into next year.  I am afraid there is very little to say here but hope to have something of interest to tell next time if I go on leave.</p>
<p>Love &amp; kisses to all.</p>
<p>From<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Douglas.</p>
