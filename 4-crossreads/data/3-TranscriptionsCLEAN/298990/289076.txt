  
 Delville Wood 16/11/16 A cold and frosty morning with about an inch of ice on all water.  Bright sunshine which favoured airwork and the Taubes soon came over bomb dropping.  Beaucoup bombardment by "archies".  The Taubes are coloured white and are very hard to pick up.  They favour high flying and sudden dives of about 1000 feet when the shells burst too close.  A few black woolly bears in among the many white ones.  Doley and his men are all tired, worn out and fed up but we hope to get them cheery again with warm food and some sleep.  Eating bully beef and biscuit with dead men lying all round is not very nice.  The enemy put a few shells round the road but up until dark things were quiet.  Furphey.  That this is to be Anzac front for the winter once we have taken the ridge overlooking Bapaume.  That leave for men is being revised on an enlarged scale.  About 11 am a Taube turned turtle and fell behind our line in rear of Flers.  Many sausage balloons up but the guns remained quiet.  Darkness sets in at 4.30 pm.  Very cold night. 
 17/11/16  Intensely cold sunny day the ground frozen hard and ice an inch thick.  Icy wind.  We feel the cold very much and sick rate is big.  Never since leaving Melbourne has our esprit de corps been so bad and our morale so rotten. Constant hard work and heavy losses without any leave to the men or any other alleviation of their monotonous work has made them all quite fed up.  So many new men who are not known to their officers affects our fighting efficiency.  Our old chaps could do wonders - until we get these new men by themselves and train them hard they will never do any good. They don't try to stick it out and and readily get lost & fail to reach their destination if sent off anywhere.  The ground is frozen today and thick ice remained all over the pools and shell holes all day.  It was quite impossible to keep warm by wrapping up so I gave it up and retired into blankets before lunch.  At about 3 pm Brigade Major rang up with orders
