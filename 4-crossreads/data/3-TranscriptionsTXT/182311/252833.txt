 heard the Major General, Sir John Monash of the Division saying to the Army Corps Commander, Lieut-General Plummer (perhaps for my ears) &quot;Good chap is Peters, heart&#39;s all right, he&#39;s been raiding five times.&quot;&nbsp; Not absolutely correct of course, but very nice.&nbsp; Then the March Past while the recipients stood on the right of the General, first came our Colonel at the head of the men who had carried out our successful raid a few days before, proud of their exploits and one portion at least, proud of their officer to whom they gave an eye&#39;s-right in passing.&nbsp; &#39;Twas sorry I felt that  all  the fine lads were not there, but those things must be. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; After dismissal the recipients received the personal congratulations of the officers present, expressed in quite a friendly manner. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Then back to our motor-waggon and so back to the billets in the old laundry.  ^  at  Erquinghem
