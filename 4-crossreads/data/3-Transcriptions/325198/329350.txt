<p>23 Aug, 1916<br/>Montazeh<br/>Rather a change this from the 3rd A.G.H.  Smithy [indecipherable] &amp; I explored until we were well nigh knocked up at night.  Its an interesting place, Plenty of room, the grounds are particularly extensive &amp; well laid out but have been allowed to go wild a bit though that makes no difference to us.  The trees are planted thickly &amp; there are acres of them so that the shade they cat is dense &amp; looks cool.  The sea breeze is fresh after the hot air of Cairo &amp; its a treat to walk along the sea front.</p>
