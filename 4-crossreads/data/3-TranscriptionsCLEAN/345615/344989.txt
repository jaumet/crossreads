  
 is a much easier trip than when we went to Matruh, where it was after sundown pretty well every evening before we 'parked' the waggons 
 We have just 'dined' bully beef, jam, cheese biscuits tea & also  some  a billy can full of biscuit porridge which we have made over a little fire. Just Biscuits broken up small & boiled up in water till soft then eaten hot with plenty of sugar. It eats very good at the end of a day or early morning but sounds rather primitive no doubt. 
 We passed several native huts & I had a look inside for a "souvenirs" but they had been stripped
