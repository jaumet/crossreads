<p>After dinner we went to the concert at the Royal, the only bright redeeming feature was an Australian Sgt., he was really good &amp; the audience gave him a great reception.</p>
<p>3rd.  The boat roll was called again <strike>today</strike> yesterday and after it was over we all went through a medical inspection, they cut no less than 70 Sgts. off.  Lord you should have heard the cursing &amp; swearing.  I have packed up my belongings two evenings &amp; am going down town for the last time to say good bye to my friends &amp; I am not looking forward with any great amount of pleasure to the ordeal.<br/>Got 2 fine big parcels from Miss Duke yesterday the cake was in perfect condition, how good she has been to me these last 4 years something like a friend, &amp; the very thoughts of her has kept me from being tied up over here &amp; I have had some terrific temptations, &amp; now when we are on the verge of going off</p>
