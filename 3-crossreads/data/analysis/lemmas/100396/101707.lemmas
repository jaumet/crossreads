 We had a nice shower of rain here last Sunday about daybreak accompani with heavi thunder a tree was struck not more than a mile away . found a coupl of Emu chick one even not long ago they were onli about 8 inch tall such pretti chap stripe with grey dark stripe , they were easi to catch . I was go to bring one home but thought it might die ani way when they grow big they becom a pest . a chap at Wallengra had one he also had the pub store and all the chap around use to bank their money with him the emu was sometim call Jacko , but most the chicken . now this chap had no need to work for his live for reason abov mention so to while away the time he took to sport in the form of Kangaroo hunt . this would lead him mani mile from home jacko alway accompani him run with the dog in great style . it was in front of the pub that the chicken realli shone . An emu love fun of a sort in fact they are veri play . Jacko use to pick the hors on their noses a blow someth like be hit with a nulla then throw himself on the ground wave his great leg in the air , make a hideous row . these manoeuvr general end with a few smash bridl , and so the chicken brought much gain to his master . the peopl rose remonstr and the chick had to go he was taken by his owner mani mile away to Gragean and after a love farewel that person return to Wallengra at top speed a few minut later the chicken appear not even out of breath and for his faith had to be shot in the back yard .
