became very monotonous living under the ground, as it was not safe to walk about in the open much as Fritz always had a couple of Baloons up which were facing straight down the road where our battery was situated.  Very often the enemy tried to find the battery & put shells all down the road, the whole ground shook at times,  fortunately not one man was injured, & we did not have one carry all the time - we were there.  I saw a very brave action once, the gunners rushed out of their dugouts to put a fire out round one of the guns whilst a terrific fuscilade of shells were bursting in all directions. The Artillery fellows looked after us very well, gave us comforts & good tucker.  Only one thing wrong & that was the chats.
