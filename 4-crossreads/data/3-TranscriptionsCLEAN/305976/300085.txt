  
 Sunday Nov 17 Today a few of us rode to Jaffa for a swim & general look round. The Town has been cleaned up and there is a remarkable difference to when we first entered it. It is now quite a business place & the inhabitants as is usual in this country try to palm off practically worthless souvenir's on our boys at top prices. We returned about 6pm after a very pleasant day. Monday Nov 18 Today we visited the villages of Wadis, Heatean[?] & Dieran. They are still the same sleepy villages we saw last time we were down. These are Jewish villages. There is a Bedouin village
