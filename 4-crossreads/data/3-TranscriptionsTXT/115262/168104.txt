 Monday 3 December 1917. 
 Jacko&#39;s long range guns quiet today [18 Coy 4th Batt are to make a raid tonight] 
 6 pm saddled up for QM&#39;s fatigue to draw rations at new dump 1 1/2 miles along main Jaffa road from position that was shelled the other few days. Stood to awaiting orders to move to dump. Moved off at 8 pm just as bombardment for raid commenced. Flashes of our artillery lit up the whole country side. No sooner had we arrived at dump than Jacko put the shrapnel &amp; one H.E&nbsp;shell over us. Had his distance to a yard. He must have a decent spy system. 
 Threw 30 odd shrapnel shells over &amp; then knocked off. Had an hrs. rest. Drew rations when motor wagons arrived &amp; started back across the open to our position &amp; travelled till midnight. 
 Raining with a cold wind.
