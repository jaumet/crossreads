<p>1st  SQUADRON, AUSTRALIAN FLYING CORPS.<br/>REVIEW OF OPERATIONS.<br/>From 1st JANUARY  1918 TILL RETURN TO AUSTRALIA MARCH 1919.<br/>(By MAJOR  S. W. Addison &ndash; COMMANDER)</p>
<p>The year 1918 was an epoch making period for the Squadron. Its advent saw the passing of the old machines &ndash; the early products of 'R.A.F." ingenuity and enterprise &ndash; with which the unit had been so long equipped and which had so seriously handicapped its Flying Officers in the performance of their allotted duties. As disclosed in the review of 1917 operations, the enemy machines were at this time greatly superior to our own in both speed and climb, and what this means can only be accurately conceived by those whose lot it has been to operate in the air in any theatre where the enemy holds this advantage. Right up to the close of 1917 the machines possessed by 1st Squadron were an extremely mixed lot comprised for the most part of types that had been long since pronounced obsolete for the work that the squadron was engaged upon. The most modern type of the 'collection' was the venerable R.E.8. which predominated in numbers also. About half the machines were of this type the remainder being B.E.12. A's and Martinaydes, while even the B.E.2E's had not been relegated to its merited resting place, having been used in work over the line as late as a few weeks before the close of the year 1917. However, the New Year dawned under infinitely better auspices.</p>
<p>With the GAZA operations at an end, certain re-organisation of the Air Forces operating in this theatre had been decided upon. This included the re-equipment of 111 Squadron, Royal Air Force with scouts (S.E.5.A.)  while the Bristol fighters that they were to replace were to be handed over to 1st Squadron Australian Flying Corps. It was considered that these modern two seaters might be more profitably utilised in the work of strategical reconnaissance and photography than if used exclusively for patrols and escorts as had been the case hitherto. Subsequent experience proved this to be a wise decision. Needless to say a good deal of elation was felt by the members of the 1st Squadron when this intention was made known, for it meant that for the first time in the history of the unit, they were to meet the hostile aircraft operating in this zone on something like an even footing as far as machines were concerned. The facts that will be revealed later on in this review, convey a good idea of 'what might have been' had this equality been established a little earlier in the units career.</p>
<p>The first of the Bristol Fighters came to us during the last days of December and our old types, giving place to the new, gradually passed unlamented into a more fitting<br/>sphere of activity. The R.E.S's went to the Corps Squadron to be employed on tactical work, the B.E.12's and Martinsydes went to the 'base' the latter being used in training work. One by one those war-worn relics were written off by they "young idea! Within a few months it was heard that the last of them had passed into this category through having met a tree in landing. The B.E.2.E remained 'attached' to the Squadron as a communication machine, being used as a means of rapid transport from one point to another behind our lines. The re-equipment was carried out under a gradual process. As one of the new scout machines was delivered to 111 Squadron, they would hand over a Bristol Fighter to this unit, and we in turn  would pass on one of our machines to its new location.</p>
<p>At the end of January 1918 the equipment of the Squadron was as follows:-</p>
<p>9 Bristol Fighters<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    2 R.E.8's<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    4 B.E.12.A's<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Martinsydes<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 B.E.2.E.</p>
