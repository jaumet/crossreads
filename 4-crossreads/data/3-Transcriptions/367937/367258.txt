<p>left for a rear guard.  However we found they had left a good many men &amp; guns and they gave us a bad time for a bit.<br/>Our chaps were awfully brave and douzens of them deserve the V.C.  I think only there was so much of it that nobody noticed it.<br/>I saw Colin on Thursday morning and have arranged to meet him in at camp. He told me that Leycester was slightly wounded the Friday before.<br/>The latest news we have had is that the Turk is clearing out fast and so we are all hoping to get back to camp soon.<br/>Must go and boil the billy now.<br/>Monday 14th<br/>Here we are back in camp again and it is grand to have a change &amp; a wash again. It was beginning to get necessary as a lot of the chaps had had to start lice hunts but I am glad to say that I never got them.<br/>We got back here to Romani yesterday afternoon after being out for five days and the whole camp fairly rushed the YMCA canteen to get get tinned fruit after only having bully beef &amp; biscuit rations</p>
