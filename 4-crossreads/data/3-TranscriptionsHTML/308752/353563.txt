I will not tackle any more subjects at present, as I am sure that this Monotonous military life has made me rather dull. We must be prepared for a period when we might have to be kept in Europe for a considerable time after the war has ceased. In what better manner could this period be spent than by study &ndash; preparing ourselves for our future welfare. The idea is only in its infancy at present, but if the subject is given careful attention, good results will follow.</p>

At 6.30 a.m.</p>
