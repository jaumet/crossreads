<p>Kay returned at 5pm with his dead body.  After tea we dug a grave &amp; buried the poor chap by the light of a lantern after reading the burial service &amp; firing 3 volleys.  This is terrible &amp; I am afraid we will all go next.  All of us are ill.  Smith, Todman and Tollan very ill indeed.  I wonder how long we will last.  Any how we will all play the game until the end of that I am sure.  These boys are heroes &amp; I love them all.  May God be good to us.  Getting on well at collecting grain &amp;   camels to take the worse cases among the refugees to Bijah.  If all goes well tonight we start tomorrow thank God.</p>
