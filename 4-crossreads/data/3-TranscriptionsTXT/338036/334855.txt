 [21st  Dec. contd] &amp; bro Ernie.  Raining all day. 
 Friday 22nd  Saturday 23rd 
 Some peculiar sayings drop out sometimes and one today was typical.  Word had come through that the Commander in Chief of 2nd Army Corps would be in District today &amp; the men were told to keep an eye &amp; be careful to salute.  Consequently one of the boys came into the billet at a great pace &amp; announced that the Commander in Chief would be 'prowling' around today.  Prowling has it. Very clear day &amp; great aerial activity.  Saw some rare fighting in the air. 
 Sunday 24th  Christmas Eve Went into Armentieres in the afternoon with Corps Chas Hamblin &amp; Joe Nankevil &amp; had a good look around notwithstanding that aircraft guns were crackling all around us.  After tea we adjourned to YMCA &amp; spent the evening singing Christmas Carols &amp; Hymns &amp; subsequently listened to a natty little sermon by a South Australian. 
 On return we were surprised to see Col Maguire waiting with a load of 'Comforts' &amp; each of us received a pudding &amp; packet of things from the Comforts Fund (Each packet contained packet cigarettes (Peter Pan) small tin tobacco, Tin boiled lollies, writing pad, playing cards &amp; some nuts).  I also recd letter from bro &amp; parcel from Mrs Hodge of Crookwell.  The Colonel shook our hands all round &amp; wished us merry Xmas.
