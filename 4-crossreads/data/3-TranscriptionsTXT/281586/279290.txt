Galle Face Hotel.  A beautiful drive this.  Little children running after the rickshaw with flowers from Buddha's temple, and begging pennies  Had our photos taken in rickshaw, then rode back.  An hour away 8d each.  Beautiful Cocoanut Palms towering above all other foliage especially visible these from the ship on the left of the harbour.  Went through the native quarter, both in the rickshaw, and walking.  Very hot and the heat seemed to bring to perfect maturity all the vile smells abounding in this quarter.  Dirt and filth about everywhere.  Natives, dozens of them in very confined quarters.  Old fellows in fruit stalls with their feet up among their wares getting down and solemnly salaaming saying "very good fruit master vera clean and nice"   We did not buy
Saw old women bent and grey, only shadows of womanhood, out in the boiling sun, breaking stones, for the roads, carrying them, and making the roads.  Looks cruel and has a smack of slavery about it that doesn't leave a nice taste in a British mouth.  Women in these parts seem to have a very hard life in spite of the benefits of British rule.  Will it ever be different?  One wonders and thinks of Kipling's lines
