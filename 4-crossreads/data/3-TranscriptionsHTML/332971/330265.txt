<p>parchment looks already &amp; thoroughly enjoying the wholesome food.  So different from Madame Mealy dishes.</p>
<p>The morning we voted &ndash; for conscription or against it.  And do you know we are the first women in England who have voted on a National question.</p>
<p>25th  Two months to Xmas.  The girls are saying that the Xmas Mail closes next week.  I must stop.  This gossipy chatter though I don't like leaving you and wish you all the best that Xmas can give you.  If I should miss a mail sometimes &ndash; through pressure of work &ndash; please don't forget me.</p>
<p>Ever lovingly yours</p>

<p>PS.  There is a Sisters Mess Meeting to be held to-night &amp; the funniest thing I have struck on A Service is a Sisters Mess Meeting &ndash; but serious business is to be discussed to-night &ndash; or protested against.  We find we can't manage &ndash; especially the S Nurses.  The upkeep of this Home (St Lukes School) however nice &amp; comfy it is because apart from the 17/6 a week allowed us by the Gov that barely buys our food we have to keep a Staff of Servants &ndash; pay their salary &ndash; laundry &amp; insurance &amp; everything is so expensive/  It means that each one of us has to pay 10/- at the least out of our own salary &amp; we don't feel it [indecipherable] too that we should be <strike>asked</strike> expected to do it.</p>
<p>Bye Bye</p>
