 JANUARY 1917 
 17 WEDNESDAY 
 Had a heavy fall of snow last night 
 &amp; this morning it was four or five 
 inches deep. Snowed lightly all 
 day. Bill Constable &amp; self went 
 up to Armentieres with a G.S 
 waggon load of stuff for H.Q. 
 We left Strazeele at 1 AM &amp; got 
 to Armenti&egrave;res at 6pm. We got 
 good stables for horses &amp; billets 
 for ourselves. It would be a very 
 pretty drive in summer with 
 all the trees in leaf. Things 
 were very quiet last night with 
 the artillary but the machine 
 guns were at it all night. We 
 were within a mile of the front line 
 trenches. It was a very interesting 
 ride, seeing all the country &amp; the 
 old customs.
