home at Eastbourne and I to Brighton.
March 3rd  Really it is wonderful what can happen in a fortnight.  As soon as I enter my room I am greeted with volumes of news - Some good - some disappointing - those of us who are going to France are delighted of course - but 4 of the original unit are being left behind - Sisters Bell Rush & McMillan are three of them.  Then two weddings to-morrow Sister Walsh & my friend S Davis.  I am pleased to be back for her.  Matron & I went to the wedding & She looked perfectly sweet & pretty in a nut brown Costume.  Capt Hogan had on his Top Service Coat - stained with mud & looking as if it had done good Service on The Somme.  I fancy Stills must have asked him to keep it on for when I whispered how unique it was she smiled proudly & said "Yes, isn't it nice Anne?
7th  I'm feeling off colour with a cold & a persistent cough that makes me feel like an old woman.  And these terrible northerly March winds pierce through one at every corner & the ward I am in is like a vault.  We have 108 boys in J - mostly Australian such dear things, & how they do appreciate Blighty after the trenches.
March 14th  Twas inevitable I could cry at getting Sick at this Stage - for the fear of being left behind - but I have been in the Sick Sisters 4 days and it's a perfect haven of rest & with the Sweetest of Sisters looking after us.  I have a companion in distress Sister Mary McIlroy & its laughable the efforts we make to get well.  I take anything even Cod liver oil & [indecipherable] & pray for the blue sky & the blurred sunshine & Mary pathetically says "Oh Anne for a bottle of Condensed Australia".
