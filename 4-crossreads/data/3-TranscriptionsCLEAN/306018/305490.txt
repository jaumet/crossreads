February 1918Got on to a couple of winners but they didn't pay much.  Had dinner at Rossmore House with Wal Sharpe & 2 or 3 more of the boys from the Regiment.  After dinner we were going to the Kursaal.  It is the Scamps last performance before going to Alexandria.  We found the place crowded so we went to see "Quo Vadis" at the Salle Kleber pictures.  It is the best picture I have seen here.
Sunday 24thWas in the office till 12 oclock.  At 3 oclock went out to Mena House Hotel.  It is Mrs Cornish's last Sunday there as she is going back to Alex next Wednesday.  She asked quite a lot of the boys in the office to go out.  About 12 of us were there & we had a nice afternoon.  Mr Cornish has managed to get up for a few days.  Mr & Mrs Pengelly were there & Mrs Clark from Maadi also a Mrs Adamson & Mrs Scott.  The afternoon tea was set out in the lounge & we all sat round a big table.  Mrs Cornish
