<p>Tuesday  6/3/17</p>
<p>A fine day &ndash; heavy frost &ndash; started to thaw &amp; makes everything sloppy again. Got a letter from Mrs O'Kelly asking particulars of Hubert. Two Taubs brought down. Worth recording had a bath &amp; got a change of clothes. Fairly busy. A Bottle of Whisky appeared from somewhere in the Dug out, never asked any questions, but held a post mortem on the contents. Fritz very busy with his artillery &amp; giving in particular attention. Very few casualtys considering the stuff coming that is coming over.</p>
