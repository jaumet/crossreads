evening to Headquarters, Cairo, to meet Mac.  He is looking well.  We three went to the Methodist Soldiers Hall and spent an enjoyable evening.
January 27th:General inspection of troops by General Birdwood.
January 28th:Issued with our rifles.
January 29th:Quiet day.  Visited Cairo with Bert Argall by night.  Listened to Concert at the Y.M.C.A.  Splendid items &ndash; enjoyable evening.
January 30th:Alarm raised.  Native rising, but soon quelled.  Two hundred rounds served to us all and provisioned for twenty-four hours, but not required.  Visit Methodist Hall, Cairo, by night, and hear God's word.  Of course Bert was with me and again we met Mac.
January 31st:Rise 6 a.m.  Proceed to Kasr-el-Nil at 8 a.m. with full pack (march about nine miles) and then go on picket duty at 6.30 p.m. same night till 1 a.m. next morning.  Worst job I ever had, to think that our own lads sink so low.  Their best friend is the Picket.
