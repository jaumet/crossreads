<p>It is very interresting at an aerodrome to go round looking at the car-makers names in the different planes and then compare them with what you know of their different cars.</p>
<p><u>Later</u>&nbsp;I have just got a new hat, a beauty, the best one I have been issued with yet - it seems to be a good idea loosing an old one in action like that, only I got a sunburnt nose doing it. I wonder how Father got on at th show with the Corriedales. I ought to nearly hear next mail. No more news Mother so I&#39;ll stop. Love to Father &amp; Hal &amp; Fred and yourself. I am Your loving son Robert C Wilson</p>
