<p>Some trouble with her turbines. 15,000 tons register &amp; formally built for 18 knots.</p>
<p>June 6<br/>Still at anchor in outer roads awaiting orders. Crew &amp; troops exercised at boat drill. All sore leaving Marseilles after spending a rare old time there. One of the pleasure resorts of Europe. Very dangerous at night on account of the lamps being shaded the lights dim &amp; robberies under arms the result. Yet the French &amp; Brittish have soldiers &amp; police parading night &amp; day. The population consists of such a cosmopolitian races.<br/>Spoke to one of the naval officers at my table who was until a few months ago 3 &frac12; years a prisnor of war in Germany. Berlin. He said some of the prisnors were very badly treated. (He being interned from one of the British ships &amp; in a seperate camp to the war-prisnors were fairly well treated.)</p>
<p>June 7<br/>Our firemen causing trouble therefore the Indarra &amp; Canberra could not keep up the regulation speed of 14 &frac12; speed so that the speed had to be reduced to 14. Later during the day speed increased to 15 knots.<br/>At 7 am the transport Kaisar I Hind 400 yards abreast of us hoisted signals a man over-board. The Jap distroyer astern 1 mile stopped &amp; signalled that they picked him up &amp; was doing well. A splendid bit of work.</p>
