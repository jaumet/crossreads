<p>produce some evidence to Minister of Education I will be able to sit for degree of LLB &ndash; a two years course &amp; I have 8 mos to take it &amp; the exam is oral &amp; in french</p>
<p>So first visit I make is to Kit Store get the certificate &ndash; my coco palm walking stick &amp; several things of use to me &amp; then back to town &ndash; to Bank &amp; draw all I have &pound;16 leaving 30/- in Bank. This is all my reserve.</p>
<p>I then visit Alcock but they are closed. I then make arrangement to repair my stick &amp; have job finished to day as I intend to leave London Saturday night if I can get all done.</p>
<p>I see [indecipherable] &amp; French contingent arrive &amp; then at Moss find that a ready to wear uniform costs 7 &frac12; gns. I visit [Dean] &amp; buy some puttees, collars shoes (17/6) &amp; then Myers Tunic &amp; slacks &pound;2-10-0 Buttons must be changed etc but still a great saving. Then to Dean &amp; annex a civilian suit for &pound;5 &amp; hat 4/6. In Strand I got silk faced white shirt for 8/6 &amp; repairs to walking stick cost 2/6.</p>
<p>As I can move quicker without parcels I adopt plan of buying &amp; leaving parcels &amp; of course fail to collect one worth &pound;2-9-0 a havresack with puttees etc. This means that I must wait till Monday, &amp; pay for two days extra here &amp; in France. However it is better to do this than lose &pound;2-9-0</p>
<p>I dine to night as usual in Soho</p>
