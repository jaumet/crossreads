fall in at 3.30. &nbsp;As usual with detachments leaving during the
night all officers of the Camp turned out to see us off despite the
cold which in Egypt, even in Summer makes early rising unpopular.
Camp was left at 3.45 and we entrained at a Siding a mile of two
away, shortly after 4.30. &nbsp;The train consisted of 30 open coal
trucks which had to accommodate about 30 men each as, with other
units out detachment consisted of about 900&nbsp;men. &nbsp;The train did not
leave until 7 o&#39;clock so we had to spend a couple of hours in the
cold darkness in the open trucks. &nbsp;No special provision was made on
the train for Officers, so we had to satisfy ourselves with the
coal trucks. &nbsp;The country between Cairo and Alexandria opens ones
eyes to what irrigation can do. &nbsp;The whole country side as far as
you can see is a brillint green - crops of every kind growing in
profusion. &nbsp;This particular district is Nile Delta country and is in
addition watered by numerous canals, cross ditches etc. &nbsp;The method
of Agriculture is very primitive - same as has been in use for
thousands of years. &nbsp;The plow is just a wooden structure with a
single wooden spike for tearing up the ground, the reaping is
done with a hand sickle - generally by the women and children,
mostly the children, the women being used to carry the loads into
the markets. &nbsp;Women are more plentiful and cheaper than donkeys or
camels&nbsp;so their labour&nbsp;is availed of to the utmost, and I must say
that in all the places I have been I have never seen a better car-
riage or a more graceful walk than is possessed by these Egyptian
women. &nbsp;The reason is easy. &nbsp;The load which is carried on their
head is in a basket about the size used a a clothes basket on
washing days in Australia, and this is heaped up with cloves or
