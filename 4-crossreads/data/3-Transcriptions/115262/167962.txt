<p>Saturday 14 July 1917.</p>
<p>Early morning parade as usual &amp; as on every other Saturday morning we struck our tents at 5 a.m. to give to tent space an airing. Mess orderly today with &quot;Nat&quot; and then at 9 a.m. fell in for swimming parade to Bitter Lakes. Saw several native women. They are rather good looking and that&#39;s all.</p>
<p>Hospital boat &quot;Niagra&quot; &amp; a Br Cruiser in the Canal (Suez)</p>
<p>On return pitched tents. (This was <u>good</u> in the midday sun too.).</p>
<p>Wrote a letter later.</p>
<p>Sun 15th&nbsp;We visited the Spanish, Greek, French &amp; European quarters and were pleased to see some people who reminded us of home.</p>
