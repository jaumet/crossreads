November, 1915
Tuesday 30
Still cold & snowing but the wind is dropping & so [indecipherable] for us for we could get the circulation going.
Walked over to Bridges Rd. - about a mile - for water & got quarter rations last night the Turks bombarded Lone Pine trenches & killed or wounded 250.
60 were caught in a tunnel & buried alive.
Our camp was shelled by heavy howitzers but no damage was done for most of them
