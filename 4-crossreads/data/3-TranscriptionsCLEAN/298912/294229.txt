  
 At last our turn came  & on 24/12/15 we were sent back to Moore Park. Here Jock met us & gave us every thought possible & gave us final leave until 29/12/15. We all rushed home & had a great time & at midday on 29/12/15 we all met at Moore Park Depot ready for the front: 
 Jock here gave us leave until 5pm & we visited town & fixed up a few items & went to the Theatre "So Long Letty". At 5 we reported again & Jock gave us a short lecture & asked each one individually if he was ready. He then paid us up to date & gave us further leave until 6.15pm. At 6.15pm we left for the Rwy Stn singing songs & on a Kitchener's Car  - no fares. At the Rwy Jock met us & saw to our comfort, shook hands & said "Good bye Lad". He was the best officer we ever had & anyone I have ever met in the forces has always a good word for him, simply because he was a man to the soldiers & not a swaggering officer in the usual  way
