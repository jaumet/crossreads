<p>here &amp; are taking away the wounded in a Hospital ship.  A cruiser is anchored in the bay &amp; six mine sweepers are continually at work going up &amp; down like a six furrow plough for mines.<br/>By the way according to a contemporary of mine there was nothing left of those chaps blown up the other day but "'Arf a bloody 'ead &amp; a 'andful o' guts".<br/>The last two nights have been spent entirely in the saddle so I shall sleep very well tonight.</p>
<p>Xmas night<br/>Ye gods what a Xmas!  Last year this time I was dancing at Shepheards.  This year I am at El Arish of all god-forgotten places!!<br/>Went along &amp; saw Naylor at 52nd Div. H.Q. &amp; he filled me with whiskey so the day has not been quite wasted after all.</p>
