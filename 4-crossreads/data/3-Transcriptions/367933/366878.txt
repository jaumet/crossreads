<p>No soon the men were settled in Egypt again the commanding officer sent us word to send supplementary foods rather than clothing, which is not required in any quantity over and above the ordnance supplies whereas changes of diet are absolutely essential and in January last we discontinued the practise of including private parcels in our depot cases.

We now have a fairly complete grocery store and by purchasing your parcel supplies from us or by allowing us to make up and post your parcels you are helping the fund to be self supporting.</p>
