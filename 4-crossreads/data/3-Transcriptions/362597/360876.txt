<p>Tuesday 18.1.16 (27th)<br/>We come in sight of land again this morning at 2 am. Some fellows sat up &amp; gazed on it till daylight. It is a high mountainous coast &amp; we are steaming along about 10 miles out. We saw a tramp to starboard homeward bound to Australia. We also saw a fellucca sneaking along the coast south.</p>
<p>A small dhow passed astern about &frac12; an hour ago &amp; when we went up on deck at 6.30 we saw all the Nurses in Pyjamas &amp; wrappers hanging over the side looking at it.</p>
<p>I am cleaning knives again this morning</p>
