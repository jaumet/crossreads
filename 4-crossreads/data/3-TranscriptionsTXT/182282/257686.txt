My dearest Janet
I have just had your
kind note I am very sorry that
Annie has not entered
School yet She must take
Arithmetic along with Writing
and English if you ask
if you could not take
in hand her music I
certainly think you are
quite competant to do so
if she would only set
herself in right erneast
