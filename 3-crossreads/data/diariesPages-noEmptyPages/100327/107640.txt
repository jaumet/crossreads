for the job so trust AW to detail himself ! Hear stories of a little village there where a decent meal is to be had and donkey rides to it from camp. Whisky 8/- a bottle and lager beer also procurable. Will suit some but not a "wowser" like myself !! C.O. is a staunch Rechabite but returned from a tour round the trenches when the miners were getting their daily "dose", and remarked that he found the smell very enticing and felt he was cultivating a liking for the smell of it.
Monitor lying alongside cruiser today ? two big guns one for?d and one aft and an anti-aircraft gun pointing skywards. A blustery, bleak, wintry day the sea rough and foam-flecked, and looking grey forebidding, the swim at daylight was a chilly business and as they are breaking up the barge I had a devil's own job to get out of the water, struggling for a long time to haul myself out much to Drummonds amusement.
More miners reported from 18th Battn. Taking out over 400 bags of spoils daily now ? air pump working. We are driving right underneath Abdul's trenches. Went to bed at 1050 and read for a while

Cold dark bleak at stand to. Cutting wind. Had to keep the lads standing a long time as day was slow in breaking. Reneged on swim and went back to bad. Slept in until 0800, 
Went to Bde HQ and got orders for Imbros trip. Worked my batman in as one of the men to accompany me as the party.
Leave on Monday at 1400. Dead Engineer lying in sap shot through lungs by sniper. Sea rough foaming. Expect a seasick trip on Monday
