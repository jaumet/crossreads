 FEB.   FRIDAY 18   1916 
 Fine & very hot. On the guns in morning, and had a lecture from the OC on the use of Artillary in modern warfare in afternoon. I came in to Lisheen in evening & we all went down to the Foxe's after tea. I did not have late leave so had to leave early. I was jolly glad to get out of the house too, as it was a fair cow sitting in the drawing room with a lot of old women I did not know, listening to them gas about nothing
