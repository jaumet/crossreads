 Tuesday, 1st November, 1914 Cup Day in Melb, [actually 4 November 1914] terrific gale where we are, all boats faring badly.  Majority of men are sea-sick.  I went down below &amp; worked mine off. 
 On Picquet again discovered horse with colic &ndash; became worse but improved with attention. 
 Whilst asleep this afternoon our W.A. contingent joined us two troopers &amp; an escort at present I do not know the names of the cruisers. 
 P.T.O. for Sunday 
 Wednesday, November 1914 In the Indian Ocean at last, we have yet to pick up the W.A. contingent. 
 Sea became rough &amp; in consequence we did not have to exercise horses first aid &amp; physical culture was the order of the day. 
 Many became sea-sick I was squeamish but not sick. 
 Our boat does not seem to pitch &amp; roll like the others especially the Pera &amp; the Armadale but she is bad enough.
