<p>3rd June 1917. Left Bailleul this morning at 11 oclock and got to Steenwerck by motor. Stayed there for dinner and left for the wagon lines late afternoon.<br/><u> Later</u>  on arrival got instructions to proceed to Battery. Waited till nightfall to move up to the position  succeeded in reaching position safely although Fritz sent a few shells amongst us. But we had to take the wagon with rations via another route &amp; this led us into trouble. We ran into shells galore, blowing up of ammunition dumps &amp; not forgetting gas shells. It was a lively half hour &amp; was much relieved when we made our way back</p>
