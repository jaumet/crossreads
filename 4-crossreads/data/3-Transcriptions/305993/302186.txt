<p>after receiving the particulars re the health of the troops &amp; passengers.  We made fast at the British transport wharf at 7 a.m.  At 9 a.m. commenced disembarking troops.  At noon all troops ashore.  The saloon passengers had to remain on board as there were no trains available.  The Canberra arrived the day before us &amp; her passengers were also delayed.</p>
<p>4.4.19<br/>Passengers still on board having no train to take them away.  We had a outing around the City of Marseilles.  Everything as gay as ever.  But very few soldiers about in uniform as some months ago.  No doubt on account of the demobilision.  The British troops despatched as soon as possible by train.  The rest kept in camp 6 miles out side the City.  A few British soldiers of the permanent staff &amp; Yankee soldiers also British &amp; Yankee Military police stationed at different streets armed.  Everything is fretfully dear at Marseilles in fact the necessaries of life practically beyond the reach of the working man, so consequently a strike is on for the past 3 weeks amongst the ironworkers, Engineers, boilermakers etc. &amp; likely to become serious in the future.  German prisnors are used for wharf &amp; ship cargo work &amp; coaling &amp; those we had aboard of us seemed quite happy &amp; worked fairly well under a single British armed Tommy.</p>
<p>5.4.19<br/>At 10 a.m. all the passengers left the transport for the trains.  All the Shop hands came out on strike in Marseilles this morning so the strike is spreading, the Ironworkers demand 16/4 a day, 20 francs,</p>
