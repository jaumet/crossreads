Parade in camp 8 pm &amp; at 9 pm march off through the town singing all the way, to a rousing send off by the population. They cheered    &amp; waved to us from every window &amp; along the streets. Such a scene one could not forget. Arrival at the station 9-45 &amp; after a great deal of marching about &amp; entraining, steam out at midnight on our long journey.
