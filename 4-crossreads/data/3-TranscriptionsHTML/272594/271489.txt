<p>It has been a glorious day again &amp; the artillery has been very active, we halted quite close some of our 9.2 it was very interesting to watch to watch them lift up their black snouts &amp; spit for the fire &amp; flame &amp; steel &amp; see them jump back on their recoil springs, &amp; then the gunners jump to the gun &amp; attend to her wants.</p>
