<p>A further walk of about 50 yards close alongside a battered broken down building and the communication sap or trench was entered. By this time the rattle of Machine gun fire seemed an unbroken sound, while the artillery from both sides kept up a lively roar. The walk along this sap proved a very long one with constant halts &amp; starts. After getting used to the light we could make out that we were walking on what appeared to be a trellis bridge just clearing about two feet of water in the bottom of the trench.

It seemed hard to believe that hundreds of bullets were passing so close without doing us the least harm, at the same time it made very clear the stern reality of war &amp; our nerves were in a state of great</p>
