<p>I have only just got back to the regiment we was bringing horses up, it took us five days, riding one and leading two, Mr. Finlay was with us, we had a very good time, that is of course for the army, it was very interesting riding up we got a good look at the country, well it is a wonderfull country, the best land I have ever seen, it is all orange Groves and you can smell the orange blossum for miles, it is lovely, where we are camped now is the biggest orange growing district in the world, you will see by the name on the Card where we are camped, only two miles from the city.</p>

We are very close to the firing line now and we are expecting to get into it any time now, you can hear the guns going off all day long, I was woke up three times last night by a terrible bombardment going on and we could here our machine guns and rifles going like anything.</p>
