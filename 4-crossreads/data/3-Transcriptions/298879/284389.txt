<p>June 1915<br/>Friday 11<br/>Fine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same old routine. Feeling a bit off. Was allowed off duty today. Another artillery duel. Flies here are in millions and they are awfully familiar. They crawl over our food in hundreds.  Much sickness is reported among the various Regiments probably owing to these pests.</p>
<p>Saturday 12<br/>Fine.   Saw the doctor this morning &amp; he sent me to the clearing station &amp; from there I was placed aboard the Fleet Sweeper "Newmarket" to be sent to Lemnos Island with other sick &amp; wounded to recover.</p>
