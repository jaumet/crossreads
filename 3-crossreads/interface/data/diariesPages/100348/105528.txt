Far out at sea on a glorious day. We passed an Orient Liner today, she was a splendid spectacle, as she swept past not 300 yards away. The boxing tournament was continued this evening we are being treated to some fine sport.

Leiut Lenaham tipped that we would go to France; and tried to teach us some french phrases. He deserves decorating. The final of the boxing contest was fought and we had a concert in the evening.

Guard work again. Passed clusters of islands this morning; came abreast of Cape Guardalfure (Africa) in the afternoon. Somalie Land is a dreary looking hole. All sand dunes and thorn bushes.
