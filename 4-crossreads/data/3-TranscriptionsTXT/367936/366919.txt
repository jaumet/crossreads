 Monday 17 January 1916 Fearfully hot day.  N.C.Os class before breakfast.  Put in application to attend exam for N.C.Os.  Rifle exercises and lecture then swim.  Moved to next line of tents to B Squadron.  Nearly all men in tent sick from the dust.  I have a cold. 
 Tuesday 18 January 1916 N.C.Os class then struck tents to air the lines.  Spent morning fixing tents, then on horse picquet.  Cutting wood all afternoon.  Saw Lieut. Edwards re N.C.O. exam.  Asked Lieut. Cox for an order for a Cardigan as I had a cold, he gave me order for whole uniform.  Wonder will I get it;  other chaps will buck if I do.
