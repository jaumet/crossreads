  
 including the roads & I set gaily out on my rounds this morning to the various wagon lines (wagon lines biweekly & gun lines bi weekly also is the programme of little James) per bicycle, quite heedless of the thaw that was beginning.  By the time I started homeward the roads were simply channels of some dirty sticky material that made walking difficult & biking or pushing a bike pretty well impossible. 
 I got home here how or when I dunno but pretty rocky.  Fritz enlivened proceedings by dropping a shell or two on my road just ahead, just a parting gift I surmise as he is retiring & doesn't bother us much nowadays, not here.  On the days I go gun pitting I generally see something & wish I were a butterfly or a blowfly or something like that.  I pass round the pits smiling a mechanical smile & pass silly facetious remarks, dying to flee as fast as my old spindle legs will carry me but I don't somehow.  Gawd knows why, I don't. 
 Pure cussedness I suppose.  Anyhow this  is
