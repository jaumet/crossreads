like you to keep for me.
There are a few cards of Business people that hold some particular memories, & a small map of Paris.  The prize I drew at the leave Club was a fine pocket-knife, worth about 10 francs.
Since my last letter, I have had another trip to France & back.  I took a draft over, 60 artillery reinforcements.  Had a day in Havre and a day in Southampton coming back.  Tomorrow I am going to Codford as Court Warden, on a court martial so you see my experiences promise to be varied, on this side.
Best wishes,Your affect. Son,George.
