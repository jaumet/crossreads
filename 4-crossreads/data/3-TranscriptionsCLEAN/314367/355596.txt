quite close in all the way up - you could watch the white beach & the small houses & even the cattle - We only draw 12 feet - It's a good point to get to Rabaul quickly for then we get to our  job of work - We had to take stations to-day for 'attack'. My crowd is 4 & myself - I have the SBA - the ship's steward - the writer - (In pg office) & the ship's corporal - We stand amidships & have our stretchers ready - The 4 act as pickers up of the wounded - 2 to each stretcher - All the stewards have to become fighters & it was funny this morng to see the chief steward hard at it with his arms full of shells taking them up to the port gun - They have canvas baskets with compartments & in each compartment is a shell - Each basket has 4 & all the stewards are detailed off to carry shells & ammunition to the guns - They have to do it at the double - We haven't got Lyddite - They say the drop of a Lyddite (?raids) shell was the cause of the Bulwark disaster -
