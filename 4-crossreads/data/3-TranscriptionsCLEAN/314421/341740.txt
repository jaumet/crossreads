Last night we cleaned up our equipment for an inspection this morning at 9.30. by the Colonel. He was not satisfied and there is to be another inspection tomorrow when it is to be hoped everything will be cleaner.
I finished making some serviette rings this evening.
We were paid to night. I drew 40 Francs =  1.9.4. 5 Francs is now worth 3/8.
After pay Bill Wilson & I walked to the next village Nielle-Lez-Blequin [Nielles Les Blequin]. I purchased a Table centre costing 18 Francs for my wife and at the New Zealand canteen we purchased fresh cake and biscuits. We had a few rums & then came home.

Occasional showers to day.We are into another month and the war is raging as fierce and as strong as ever. There is no prospect of it ending this year unless the unexpected happens. This is the 1186 day of the war and all the opposing forces in the various fighting zones are infinitely stronger than during the first few week of the war. The British have made a new push on the Western front, and have attained successes that bring us over the west of Passchendaele. Our line has been pushed forward East of Trelcapelle.
