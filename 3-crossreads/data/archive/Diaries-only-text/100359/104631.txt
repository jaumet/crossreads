Thurs. was a quiet day, thank the Lord and we had it fairly easy. We made a fire and cooked some stew and made cocoa for dinner, which was a great treat. There are plenty of souvenirs about. Germans coats gas bags, bayonets and all sorts but is as much as we can do to drag ourselves through the mud without loading upwith these. I got a good water bottles, aluminimum which is much better than our issued ones, so I left my old bottle in the dug out and brought away Fritz's It is very interesting to see our aeroplanes signalling to the different Batteries. They fly over Fritz lines and hover about, then all of a sudden they will come back "Hell for leather" and signal to the Battery, which immediately fills its guns and bangs away. Perhaps at a working party or any old thing which the airmen have seen. Fritz doesn't leave his observation balloons for long, as "planes soon get among ?em and drop a bomb or put a few shots into ?em.
Friday 27th
Last night we got home about 10 p.m. 2 hours later the 14th relieved us. They are doing 48 hours on we found a good feed of stew awaiting us and good hot tea, and how we tore into it. Besides this the men on duty in camp and made is a dug out so after a good tot of rum we turned into bunk. Joy Koller made a fire and the place was quite snug. We slept in till about 9 this morning. It was glorious to be able to take off our wet boots and pants, as we have had ?em on since Sunday last. Joy brought us some Break. to Bed. Bacon and tea so here it is 12 midday and we are still in bed. We go on duty again at 6, for 48 hours, so we had better make the most of our spell. Our Putties and great coats are all caked with mud, so most of us have either discarded them, or cut the cots off at the waist. We wear sandbags, tied on with bandages, instead of putties, and when we line up on Parade present a very comical appearance.
