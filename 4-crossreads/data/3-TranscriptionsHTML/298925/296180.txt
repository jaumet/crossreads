<p>"Quaker Girl"</p>
<p>Come with me  Come to the ball<br/>Music &amp; Merriment call<br/>Golden &amp; Gay are the lamps above<br/>Every tune is a song of love<br/>Ladies that come to the ball<br/>I am in love with you all<br/>Each has a part in my heart<br/>At the ball  At the ball<br/>Come to the dances while you may<br/>Flowers &amp; Romance fade with the day<br/>Come in your beauty fair as a rose<br/>Dancing's a duty everyone knows</p>
<p>A Long Long Trail</p>
<p>There's a long long trail a winding<br/>Into the land of my dreams<br/>Where the Nightingale is singing<br/>And the White moon beams<br/>Theres a long long night of waiting<br/>Till my dreams all come true<br/>Till the day when I'll be going<br/>Down the long long trail with you</p>
