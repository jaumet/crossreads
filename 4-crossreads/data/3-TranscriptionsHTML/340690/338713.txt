<p>was to be scrapped so all went out to Bn. H.Q. right round Merris Street through supports and on through Merris Street till we reached a house on east of Mont de Merris.  Thus about 80 yds overland to job.  Shelling now stopped and we got to work on excavations and assisted at intervals by Robb &amp; Major.  Heavy work and couldn't do all we wanted to.  All of timber up and some other gear &amp; pontoons drew machine gun fire.  Robb sent me down Merris Street near Battn. to collect some camouflage by myself.  Got back safely after long walk &amp; got some from covered in trenches containing T.M.C. gas cylinders.  Just before last wagon left a heavy bombardment started all round us and some shells fell very close but no damage.  Major told us to stop soon afterwards so camouflaged up and started home.  Strain walking on top had a M.G. &amp; 4 snipers on him till told to get down.  Home quietly &amp; to bed tired.</p>
<p>26.6.18<br/>Stayed in bed till nearly tea time.  Fine then up and washed and in evening wrote letters &amp; diary.  Only Linton, Edmonds &amp; Reid going out, 10th raid at 11 o'clock.  Edmonds fairly nervous.  Linton stayed in and Strain, Reid, Edmonds &amp; another out.  Wrote a good few letters and bed at 12.  Barrage at 12.30 and fairly heavy.</p>
<p>27.6.18<br/>Up after dinner and after cleaning up wrote letters rest of day.</p>
