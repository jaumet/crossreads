<p>9/1/18 Bath<br/>The old Roman bath seemed to be very modern judging from the exterior. All this quarter has an old world air about it and a church near by has the flying dragon wind vane familiar from those of Wren's London churches. Walked out of the town a little way and got among what were evidently billets &ndash; plenty of sentries outside the different houses and what seemed to be a great waste of men. The saluting damned annoying, the Tommies going to great pains to salute right across the road and almost round corners. This with the bad walking and unpleasant weather, drove me indoors so I returned to the hotel. A fog hanging over the town. Had the day been fine the view from the surrounding cliffs and high ground would have been splendid.</p>
