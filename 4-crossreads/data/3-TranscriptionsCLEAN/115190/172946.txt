It is about 4 pm and the firing continues until night fall.  (The result of the m gunning our fire is that only about 300 ^of the enemy got away that night & these were are caught early next morning.  ^The remainder weare killed or taken prisonercaptured.  (The next day, the road shows a veritable shambles.  About  400 hundred dead are counted.  Motor drivers are found sitting there dead clutching their steering gear & ^we see a dead ^Syrian girl was found in a  in a Gharrie.  Scores of the wounded have crawled away & died each side of the road.)  The uninjured at the rear were taken prisoners.)  We off saddle & settle down for the night.  My horse has been without water all day & we discover an old well near by & take our horses to water
