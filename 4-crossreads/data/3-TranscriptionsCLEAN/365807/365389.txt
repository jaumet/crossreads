Dear Sir,
I was very glad to receive your letter today, as I promised Lt Fergusson that I would write to you & give technical details of his wound. Unfortunately, your telegram containing your address was lost, & I have therefore not been able to write till now.
The military authorities will not allow any medical details to be sent by telegram to relatives at home. This will explain why my wire to you was so short.
Fergusson was wounded by a bullet passing through his R. arm; I think on Mar 31st; while waiting to be brought down he was struck by a small piece of shell on the left side of the head. He was brought to this C.C.S. on the morning of Ap. 1st;  he was a little drowsy, & I allowed him to remain quiet in bed for
