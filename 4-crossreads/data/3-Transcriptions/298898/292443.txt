<p>Tuesday 23rd Jan.<br/>Extremely cold altho' not unduly affected by it. All my mixtures are frozen hard &amp; have to be warmed before I can use them. Anything left damp such as a towel is frozen stiff &amp; an overcoat if wet will stand up on its own. Temp. 15 &deg; below freezing I believe. Went through &amp; checked dispensary during the day &amp; sent in a recq. for more stuff. Took over a small canvas possie from one of the chaps leaving, very nice, contains stretcher, fire place locker etc. etc. a perfect little home &amp; standing out amongst the snow by itself looks very quaint. At night lit the fire, boiled some water &amp; had a good wash before turning in, a luxury this weather.</p>
<p>Wednesday 24th Jan.<br/>Had to shift the dispensary so had a very heavy day as there was a great lot to move &amp; rearrange. Twas a job I liked however. Still extremely cold the wind especially blowing over the snow almost cutting</p>
