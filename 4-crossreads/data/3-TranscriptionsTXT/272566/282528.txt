Still fine.Great contest in the air resulting in a severe loss to our air service.  9 German planes & 6 of ours had a battle in which 5 of ours came to earth & only one Fritz.  Two of the planes came down in flames.  More explosions have occurred in Bapaume.  3 of us are now sleeping on the ground floor instead of the cellar using stretchers to keep us off the cold tiles.One of our posts along this Bapaume-Peronne Road has been cut out & the men are now in at the Main Dressing Station, Bapaume, erecting tents etc.  15th F. Amb. have moved up from Bernafay.  Probably our post will soon be cut out as there is no work to do here.
