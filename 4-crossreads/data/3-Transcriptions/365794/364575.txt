<p>Saturday 22nd June, 1917 [1918]<br/>Last day at 27th and with what regrets do I leave and so many kind expressions of regret from the staff make me know they are really sorry too.  Breakfast in bed then packing.  Matron comes in 11 a.m., will you soon be out?  "Yes am trying Matron".  "Could you try a little harder" tone causes much mirth on my part, she is very sweet to me &amp; says to come &amp; see them often but experience tells me the visits <u>back</u> are very few in one's life.  2.30 p.m. we depart in an ambulance and arrive 31st G.H., report ourselves and not being wanted go to town, buy 2 pictures (Jacope's) &amp; dinner at 7.15 p.m., such a crowd of women at long tables &amp; food badly served &amp; very indifferent mess.  Joys to mention.  Have a bed beside large window overlooking the old garden, 4 beds in room.</p>
