Well we are fast being iniatated into the art of doing Fatigues of different Kinds, Lately we have been on two different jobs No 1 ? we Rise from our feather beds at 4.30 A.M. Breakfast, 4.45 AM. start work about 6 A.M. after walking about a mile, we only do 4 hours on this job then home for dinner, during the afternoon some of us sleep read or write. Those who cant sleep do the reading writing. Im one of them ? No. 2 job we fall in a 7-15 P.M. same day march about 6 miles and commence work finish between 2 a.m. 4 a.m. we usually arrive back about 4 a.m. and turn in, last day we were on this job we arrived back at camp a little earlier, waked up again at 5 A.M. for Breakfast, and then allowed to retire and sleep till dinner time, at 2 P.M. fell in for Parade, but we are lucky, our company does the job and, says things, regarding Fatigues in general, another company I will not name, went out on this same job. 3 or 4 parties, went to where the work was to be done, but they did not like the job, so under cover of the darkness they decided to leave it for anyone who was willing to do it and off they went, consequences were, the allotted amount of work was left to a few, but that Company has been sent on the same Fatigue, about twice to our once as Punishment.
