 Everyone as &quot;mud&quot;  as  compared with this officer.&nbsp; I mention this incident as the visit of this &quot;staff officer&quot; played a very big part in my future life in the A.I.F.&nbsp; This day was destined to in many ways improve my army existence, but did not by so doing necessarily reduce the risks of losing my personal existence altogether.
