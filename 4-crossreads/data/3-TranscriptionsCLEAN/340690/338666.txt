  
 I caught a lorry to Watts lines and got kit ready and had dinner and limber came soon after.  Snowing heavily and walked and caught lorries.  Arrived at Kemmel at 3 and after a cup of tea went out to Spoilbank.  Fair bunks in deep tunnels and fair amount of room.  Went to bed very tired.  Heavy fire on sector. 
 3.3.18 Stayed in bed till 11 and got up and cleaned things.  In front of Major at 2 but nothing happened.  Put in application as chemistry & physics for gas school.  Had to go out to-night at 10.30.  Extremely dark and couldn't see till half way out.  Went out along light Railway to Oak Tree Dump and not a good track.  Met infantry party with my seven sappers and on good duckboards (double) to supports.  Out a bit further to a wood where there is a camouflaged trench and we started work throwing up a revetment.  Raid started on right at 11.45 with a heavy bombardment and soon spread to our sector.  We got some lively shells and one dud fell right in our parapet.  We moved down supports but he followed us and things were very lively.  M.G. [machine gun] bullets were very bad all night and we stood to.  Started again at 1 and worked till 3 and home a good deal lighter.  Boot slight wound in chin & evacuated.  Dull & cloudy. 
 4.3.18 Home and had breakfast at 4.30 and slept more or less till 3 & cleaned up rest of day.  Rosewarne & I only going out to-night.
