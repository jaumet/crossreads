 3rd Sept. Took over Area "B" section 5 - Capt. Skelsi N.Z.R.E.  cabled and received instructions re defences of Post.  All the men of any experience whatever retained in No. 6 area.

Altogether unsafe and inadequate as represented to Division.  There are no supports.  No Reserves, and all the men who are not raw are dead beat - The Territorials are poor physiqued and undersized and when put to work with tools at digging make the poorest show - There are only 4 officers with them.  Should any misadventure occur in this command the above is recorded but responsibility cannot rest with the Brigade from which all its men have been detached  and sent to another section.
