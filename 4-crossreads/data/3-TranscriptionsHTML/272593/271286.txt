<p>Last night coming home from the trenches I took my boots off &amp; walked the boards in my socks.<br/>Had a good long sleep during the day &amp; just at tea time Mr. Page came round with an order that we were to proceed to the firing line at once &amp; had to be at Rexham Rd at 6.15 that left us &frac12; an hour to have tea, pack, &amp; push off in,  after reaching the firing line put my "reliefs" on. I then took "the watch" till 9. &amp; nothing happened during the night. The majority of the men come off at day-light for they are too exposed.<br/>31st  What do you think of this  our sentries &amp; the Germans exchange greetings any time of the day, we are both in full view of one another &amp; it seems to be a mutual agreement for neither sides to shoot, we are only 60 or 70 yds away, &amp; you can go out any</p>
