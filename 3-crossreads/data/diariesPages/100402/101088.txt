Friday 14 June
Put into our own little hospital to-day with a temp. of 103 deg; and feeling much off colour.
Saturday 15 June
Much better to-day temp. is again normal, but very stiff and sore.
A big attack by the Bosche is expected to-night & amp; troops are being moved up to meet it. Our bearers are going up again as well some from the 2nd Field. In fact I think our people have rather reliable information as to the German's movements on this front. Even on  mile of front where we were, three divisions were identified in eight days.
