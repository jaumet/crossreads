<p>7 May 1915<br/>Friday</p>
<p>We are woke up by the sound of a big gun close to where we are about 5 a.m.<br/>Later on some of the old Battn come down from the fire trench   &amp;  tell us about the terrible time they have had. In two splendid charges they took several of the positions held by the Turks but lost nearly six hundred killed   &amp;  wounded including nearly all the officers</p>
<p>1915 May 8<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>When not in the firing line the men live   &amp;  cook in the holes in the hillside known as dugouts. During the day Dad   &amp;  I dig out a hole for ourselves   &amp;  start batching. We have plenty of preserved tucker in the shape of Biscuits, Bully Beef, Bacon, cheese, Jam, Ham,   &amp;  any amount of tea   &amp;  sugar.<br/>At seven in the evening we take our first turn in the firing line</p>
