<p>at parts till we came to the hilly region near Rouen.  Stayed at Rouen a short time, then were through a succession of tunnels &amp; on to Le Havre.<br/>Disembarked at Le Havre at the wharf but no boat was ready for us, so we marched 6 miles through the town up to a camp on a hill at the back of the town.<br/>It was a well managed camp &amp; a drink of tea was very welcome after the long march with full pack up.<br/>Next morning helped in sick parage &amp; at 2 p.m.</p>
