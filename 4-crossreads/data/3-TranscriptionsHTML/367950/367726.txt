<p>About 10.30 am this morning I was out visiting one of the Signal stations when a Taube was sighted away back among the various camps. Presently the artillery commenced shooting at him but he was literally miles above their highest shots. It was wonderful, the <strike>undecipherable</strike>  altitude he reached. Our planes started off ahead of him flying towards El Arish to endeavour to cut him off and rising gradually. But The Taube came flying over the heads of them and sailed away like a Huge bird for home. Barring accidents Fritz has the situation well in hand every time and enemy and all as <strike>his</strike>  he is one cannot help but have the greatest admiration for him; for his wonderful pluck and his dash and his cleverness. As Napoleon said to the British "I hate them, I hate them, yet I cannot help but admire them".<br/>RSM Crane SQMS DRN Walker Sgt Pat Jones &amp; a few more back from Details yesterday</p>
