 1.3.38 In Flander Field In Flander field the poppi grow Between the cross , row on row That mark our place : and in the sky The lark still brave sing , fli Scarc heard amid the gun below . We are the Dead . Short day ago We live , felt Dawn , saw Sunset glow , Love , and were love , and now we lie In Flander field . Take up our quarrel with the foe : To you from fail hand we throw The torch : be your to hold it high : If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep , though poppi grow In Flander field . John McCrae .
