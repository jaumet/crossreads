 our woke up suffici to rais a whistl , but as the other engin then immedi slid silent back again down the hill , our relaps into slumber again . It turn out it was not the quiet of the place affect it at all , but a breakdown on the line below us . Howev , after a coupl of hour , all was clear and away we went again , this time at an increas pace to tri and catch the old enemi , Time . Rock , sway and rattl round breakneck bend , we roar still down and down . And the great hill close in even closer . On our right lay the Wadi bed , mani feet below , and rise from it precipit rocki mountain . On our left , in place the great hill tower abov us , sometim rise sheer from the line in rug rock format . And now , also , we had done with the cultiv area , but the mountain were green with the bright grass and the glossi green of evergreen oak , while wild hollyhock in glorious profus spangl the green with colour . And still the enclos hill grew wilder and more rug , the bend sharper , and the descent steeper . Look ahead , the line alway appear to end in a " cul de sac " and one wonder which way we turn next . And then , with a sudden that was astound , the hill on either side open out , and with a rush and a roar we were out onto the great plain of Esdraelon , cover as far as the eye could see with field of wave barley , grow golden toward harvest . And so for mani mile we rode thus , the crimson of the set sun die to a richer hue the great ripen barley field , and tint too , the great fruit orchard and garden with it ruddi fire . A rich land this , a land in this part inde fulfil the Old Testament descript , "flow with milk and honey " . A land , too , across which , so peac and seren it look , it seem imposs that war should have so late stept . And yet it had , and under the green of the tree , and grow grass and wild flower , Death himself held sway , and his Kingship was acknowledg in the mani quiet grave with white cross which we pass . And the set sun gild these too , touch them with a tender glori , as though in bless . And so dark fell , and one by one , the star lit their lamp , and then the moon rose , and by and bye we rattl into Ludd . Here we had to chang train , and wait about three hour for our train . We went and had tea , and return to the platform [ Fals Page 74 - Duplic of Page 73]
