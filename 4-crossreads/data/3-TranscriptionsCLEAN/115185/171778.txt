My dearest Mother & Father. Time is going very quickly, I hope it means the end of the war. I was disappointed not hearing news at Freemantle of Constance and hope that all goes well with her. I feel of course that no news is good news and try not to work about her and Gibson - we are into hot weather now - and all the ports are closed down and three very hot and stuffy in a cabin. But I have such nice women with me that it makes all the difference. They shared a room at Sydney Hospital and are good friends. I have not felt seasick at all and am feeling much stronger and more energetic again. I eat all I can - and take the little meals in between times as you suggested. Mother
