<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; We were issued with sand bags which are to take the place of our putties, and funny characters we look.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Fatigue duty is the order of the day and night in this camp. One party would start each morning, and another party about eight at night, the first lot returning late in the afternoons the latter returning in the early hours of the morning. This work was both interesting and most exciting. The parties were changed occasionally, so that we all had a bit of each, thereby causing no ill-feeling on account of apparent favoritism.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The night duty was the most risky and exciting. We had to walk along &quot;duckboards&quot; (these are two pieces of wood on each side with small pieces nailed across at intervals, each &quot;duckboard&quot; being about six feet long) which had been placed on the shell-ploughed land.

On occasions we would meet others returning, they would have to step off to allow us to pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I remember on one occasion I stepped off to allow a loaded chap to pass, and found myself suddenly in a deep shell-hole, full of snow. On recovering my equilibrium, I started to get out, and seeing something dark on the side, I came to the conclusion that another chap must also have fallen in, so caught hold of him to assist me in my endeavours to get out. What was my surprise to find that instead of the fellow going from me he came towards me, and to my horror I discovered it to be the dead body of a Fritz, frozen hard and stiff. It gave me a nasty turn, but I very soon got quite used to that kind of thing. I was dead tired when I fell in that hole, but my energy and agility</p>
