Wednesday May 16thLooks very much like rain. Went for a walk round Bow this morning with Mr R. He also visited some people he knew. As there is no bath here I had to go to the Council Baths to have a bath, they are very good. Met Tal at Homerton station & we went to Madam Tussards at South Baker St. It is a fine display of wax-work figures etc. There are some very interesting personalities there, also some ghastly scenes. Some of the figures are very amusing, & life like. Developed some photos we took yesterday, also a real I took in France, they all came out fairly good, Tal has a plate camera.
Thursday May 17thRaining all day, I printed two of the photos we developed last night, but the light was not strong enough. As I am going to Edinburgh this evening, I left home at 11.30 am & went to Queen Victoria's statue, where I was to meet another chap, who was going up with me, but he did not turn up, so I decided to go without him, & went on to Kings Cross station. Caught 7.15 pm train for Edinburgh. Slept every now & again. There were seven in the carriage. The train seemed more like a troop train than an express, as there were a terrible lot of soldiers travelling by it.
