<p>2<br/>I hope you  &amp; Papa   &amp; Family are all quite well  &amp; that the war is not being felt too much in Sydney.  The Turks are, I think getting near the end of their tether as their communications are practically cut   &amp; their supplies must be uncertain   &amp; insufficient.  Malta is rather a pretty place although I have not seen much of it.  I went for a drive round in a sort of cab the other day which was very interesting.</p>
<p>Goodbye for the present love to all</p>
<p>Your affectionate son Charlie</p>
