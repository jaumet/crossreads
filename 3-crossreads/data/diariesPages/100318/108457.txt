Stayed in bed until about 10 and then did a lot of writing before lunch. Walked down to the Regtl. Office and found Cox and his minions very hard at work. Dealt with a large accumulated mass of paper re all kinds of military business. After lunch Rodda pushed off for the commencement of his trip to London and we shall miss him a great deal. Of late his nerve has not been as good as heretofore. During the afternoon conducted private correspondence. A hot and oppresive day. At 5 received orders to go up the line and take over the battalion again. After some dinner rode up to where Bde. H.Q. was ? about 2 miles from Villers Brettoneux and there saw General Robertson C.M.G. D.S.O.
