before we came all the little puddles would crack under your feet. Hands red almost numbed but have to tumble out to parade. Had a bit of a march about inspected by Major told we might be in the business in 6 or 7 weeks. Medical examination. Another novelty aeroplane flying about. I saw 4 up at once. You can hear the hum of their engines as they go over. Got innoculated again. Had a stiff arm to go to bed with that night.
Wed Thurs.
Not as cold as yesterday. Dental parade. Snowed a bit during the night.
Fri.
Snowed fairly heavily today about an inch deep.
Sat.
Had about a 12 or 15 mile route-march. By jove I was knocked up at the finish, feet aching a treat. Went to picture show that night.
