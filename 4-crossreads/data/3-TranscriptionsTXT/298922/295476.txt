Saturday 9 June 1917
Well we've had our Field day & took the positions. Two of our Officers were decorated with Croix de GUERRE etc. & when the French General presented them, he kissed our hard faced officers who stonily stared in front of them.
After, we marched past in clouds of dust & returned to Camp very thirsty.
[The following paragraph crossed through.]  No cable from Dolly think there must be some mistake - or I would have heard re Father's death. I have written her, that some of the Officers have been Kissed by more than a French General in Egypt!!
