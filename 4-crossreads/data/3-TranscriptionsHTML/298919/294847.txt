<p><u>Thursday 12th August 1915.</u>  Oil tanker "Bloomfield" brought alongside early this morning &amp; commenced taking oil in from pipes on the quay straight away.  Progress in loading us is very slow owing to the shortage of rails.  The morning was very pleasant, quite warm in fact, went down town to make some purchases.  The propr of a newsagency I visited told me that he had heard separately from two friends that a Zeppelin had been destroyed at the mouth of the Tyne about 5 weeks ago.  A very thick, though shallow fog enveloped the North Sea at the time &amp; the Zeps people lost their bearings so they descended.  Unfortunately for them they descended quite close to one of our warships</p>
