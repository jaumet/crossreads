<p>FEBRUARY 1917</p>
<p>14 WEDNESDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; sunny &amp; warm. Was</p>
<p>called out at 4 AM to go</p>
<p>up &amp; shift our gun out to</p>
<p>the trenches sniping. We</p>
<p>took it right down the</p>
<p>Houplines to within about</p>
<p>800 yds of German trenches.</p>
<p>Came back to waggon</p>
<p>Lines &amp; went up again in</p>
<p>evening &amp; brought it</p>
<p>back to the pit. Got</p>
<p>letter from mother.</p>
