Edinburgh
Went with Audrey to 0St Johns Church in Princes St ? the fashionable church full of well fed unctuous and eminently respectable folk. After we had lunched we had a turn in the gardens and there met an officer of the Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders and his wife. Their little youngster afforded us much amusement all the rest of the morning afternoon. We dined quietly in the evening and then we talked all till bed time. This morning the view of the Castle from Princes Street was superb ? the embodiment of Scotch character standing up on its stern crags. There used to be a loch at its feet but now there exists a fine garden which today was ablaze with tulips and rhodedendrons. To bed after 11.
