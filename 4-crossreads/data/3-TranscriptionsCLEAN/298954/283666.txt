1918Sun 23rd JuneBernard, mon ami francias, in a cooking lesson revealed the virtues of common burdock as a vegetable.   Even the Russians don't eat that so I was able to find plenty growing around the camp.   I cut some over by the Russian barracks & boiled it.It was splendid;  just like spinach.
Mon 24thWe are now living by ourselves in a deserted barrack.    We added McCarthy to our mess, but it was then overweighted with Temperament.   McCarthy & McGrath were inseparable for a week & then had a fight, with McCarthy grabbing a table-knife to end matters.   Whittaker shrieked;   dear old George just looked up from his book & calmly watched.   McC has gone back to his barrack;   while McG fights (verbally, almost physically) with me in his stead.   We also were inseparable till McG. told me that the McGraths were the Royal Clan of Ancient Ireland & I remarked that every Irishman I had ever met, no matter how haggishly ignorant, always laid claim to be descended from kings.
Anyhow, today we were called out on Appel and asked to keep a watch on the lavatories to prevent Russians stealing the timber of which the hygienic abortions are built!
