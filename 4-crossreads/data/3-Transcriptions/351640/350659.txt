<p>This is Passion Sunday.  I heard Mass, said by Padre McAuliffe at 7 a.m., the early hour suits me better than 9 a.m. because I go round the hospital at 9-15 to see what patients are in my beds.  On a Sunday in this land 'tis meet to think about "Christ, who, by the Holy Ghost, offered Himself without spot unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead words to serve the living God"; because not many miles from where I sit are places where He &amp; his relations lived during many years.  "He is the mediator of the New Testament; that by means of His death, for the redemption of those transgressions which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance; in Christ Jesus our Lord" &ndash; v. today's Epistle from Hb. C. 9, 11-15.  But few in this country believe in Christ.</p>

<p>To my good friends Mother M. Joseph, M. M. Bertrand, M. M. Pius, and their colleagues wish lives prosperous long and ever happy; that comfort, joy, &amp; good fortune hourly fall upon them; and when in due time God's dispensation comes may each with Goodness fill up one monument.</p>
<p>To Yourself my dear like good wishes too, they being accompanied by much love and heaps of kisses, from<br/>Your lvg &amp; affectionate father<br/>John B. Nash</p>
