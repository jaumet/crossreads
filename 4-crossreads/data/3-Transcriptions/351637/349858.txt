<p>Thursday June 30th<br/> I remained at Imnros all day. Maxwell came to see me in the morning. He was very disgruntled because all our correspondence has to go direct to the Chief of the Staff and not to him. I suppose he has let things through of which they do not approve.

He said it was General Braithwaite plan to never let anyone have access</p>
