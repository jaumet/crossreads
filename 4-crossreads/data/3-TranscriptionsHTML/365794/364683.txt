<p>Sunday 7 October 1917<br/>Our 4th Sunday on Ayrshire.<br/>Slept on deck &amp; how good the fresh air was, then H.C. 7.45 a.m., 5 communicants, 10-30 matins.  Solomons request for wisdom commented upon for our guidance, refrain from gossip etc.<br/>Can we ever hope to apply this to our daily lives?  We are shut up here, 27 women all different religions, training, etc.<br/>At 1 p.m. said (by the Padre) to be about 450 miles from Columbo.</p>
<p>"Absent", 16-10-'17<br/>Indian Ocean &ndash;<br/>And sometimes too upon the midnight air,<br/>The veil is lifted in answer to my prayer<br/>Then shall I rest content to do His will,<br/>Knowing you love me, knowing you love me still.</p>
