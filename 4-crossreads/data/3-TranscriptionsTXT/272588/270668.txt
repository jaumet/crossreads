Friday 1 March"March comes in like a lion", snowing, raining etc.  We moved to-day to Kemmell, Main Dressing Station.  The village is certainly knocked about, but nothing in comparison to villages on the Somme.  We move up to the line to-morrow but I think things will be quiet.
Saturday 2 MarchMove up to a cross roads, locally known as the Brasserie, on the Ypres road & camp in dugouts in the brewery.  We are a little north of Wycheate.  The A.D.S. is about 11/2 miles further on & I believe very comfy.  The weather is cold, wet & miserable, snowing off & on.  We go to the A.D.S. tomorrow on fatigue work. Heavy bombardment last night in consequence of a raid by Fritz in which we lost many men killed, etc. & "he" was successful.
