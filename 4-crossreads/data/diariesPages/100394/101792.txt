April 8th. I will show an instance of military inconsistency. In my Brigade a man was given 2 days C.B. for being absent without leave. In the Howitzer Brigade a man was given 28 days ([indecipherable] for the same offence. The Colonel of the Howitzer is an old tartar (Cox. Taylor) He likes to see men crimed and says it denotes negligence on the part of the NCO’s and officers who lay the charge He also gave a man 7 days for wearing his cap on the back of his head.
