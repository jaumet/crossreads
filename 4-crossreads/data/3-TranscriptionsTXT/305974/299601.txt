6 ThursdaySea very much calmer.  Rather a cloudy morning. Great criticism shown by the men of the different states between the capitals of the different states in C ward, owing to the fact that every state is represented bar W. Aust.  Felt very much better in the morning, but not in afternoon, getting well looked after. Still no land in sight.  The nurses are very kind & also the orderlies.
