 3 8. Working Q.M's. attached to Capt. Neeves rationing party, up &amp; down to posts with rations. 
 Three more wounded yesterday besides Billy &ndash; Pullen &amp; Rowe and Owen Burton. 
 9.  To continue yesterday's Diary. Mail, Literary Supplement &amp; a barren number and a T.B.C. letter re "Certain Noh Plays of Japan" - Cuala Press.  This they can supply for half a guinea:  while Baker's ask the fancy price amongst their super. books at 25/-.  For Cuala Press book I'll try further the T.B.C.  While on London leave there in the morning I bought Cuala Press book of 'Synge &ndash; by Masefield', at half a guinea:  in the afternoon &ndash; it raining so I did the Charing Cross Road bookshops &ndash; at Beaumonts then priced them to be sold copy at one guinea. 
 Trip up now to Menin Road and the Ypres stations with rations.  Evening:  Trips to both stations quiet. 
 10. Today &ndash; to have been the morning of the stunt &ndash; the roads to Ypres and Menin Road heavy with traffic &ndash; Artillery &ndash; guns and limbers, G.S. wagon of the Engineers with their limbers, &amp; Infantry marching &ndash; in long single file, parties of about 50 men stretched with the same intervals between parties.  Mostly 3rd Division &ndash; brilliant with colour patches.  Then ordinary 'Eggs a'cook' unit patches on either sleeve:  below, and on both sleeves red, black or gold square of sides 2":  and on their backs great 5" square patches of red:  and their runners, signallers, M. Gunners, etc., wearing their colour band above the cuff &ndash; and on it their unit patches overplaced. 
 They're not as fit as the 1st Division lads &ndash; but they're not just in after almost a four months spell. 
 Shells, and munitions, bombs, etc., long trains of full loads, one following the other along the light rails:  then returning with the salvaged 18 pounder boxes, and bomb boxes. 
 Word of more wounded today, Pullen, Rowe &ndash; Pullen was reported wounded a week ago, exaggeratedly and Owen Burton.  just before we'd arrived at Menin Road post, Kinsett of the Transport knocked, one of his horses killed and other slightly wounded.  The Transports 3rd casualty in France!
