May 1915Tuesday 4Fine with cool wind.Misfortune seems to be following our Reg. Our Col. (Braund]) was shot dead last night about 1.30 PM. With a bullet through the head, it is beleived by a stray bullet. Both the enemies guns & ours are very quiet. More reinforcements are coming for us today. Our Hydroplane is doing his tour of inspection over the battle field. Letters from home again. Received a beautiful mouth organ from Clare.
Wednesday 5Cloudy.  Moved into the firing line again on the right of our position. Splendid sheltered trenches. The Turks gave us no trouble except to give us a shot at the trench occasionally. It was cold towards dusk. Our artillery had a turn at them about 7 P.M. and shook them up a bit. We watch the enemy through periscopes.
