<p>Broadmeadow Camp<br/>Newcastle<br/>1st November 1915.<br/>Dearest old Mrs,<br/>How do?  I arrived at Camp about 9 on Saturday night &amp; found Captain Vickery the other Medical Officer down &amp; apparently with measles.  I packed him off to Sydney yesterday and wired for another medical officer &ndash; I understand one is coming up to-morrow.  I sent you a wire this afternoon but suppose you'll not get it till to-morrow &ndash; I find that to-morrow (Tuesday) is the last day for getting one's name on the federal roll &amp; that you are liable to be fined if it is not on so you had better bustle off to the local post office &amp; have a look at the rolls and if our names are not on get them put on.<br/>I journeyed out to [indecipherable] this morning &amp; had lunch with them &ndash; they had had a recent wire from Uncle Joe saying he was alright.<br/>Pretty comfortable here &ndash; cake a great success   Best love all at home, in haste.<br/>Yr Loving husband  Will</p>
