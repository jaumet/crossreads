 Sunday 18 November 1917. 
 Moved out at 11 a.m. &amp; travelled through several villages and orchards. The scent of the blossoming hedges is beautiful. The orchards have been well kept &amp; watered. 
 Bivouacked 2 miles from sea. 
 (A crook camping ground practically a bed of thistles). 
 No picquet for me tonight.
