I have got a very stiff shoulder and neck this afternoon, & if it is no better in the morning I will parade sick.  [Some shorthand here] I sent the parcel to my wife today, & registered it.  It cost 1 franc and a half to register it. A big battle is raging in Flanders and Langemarck has been taken. 
 Tuesday August 21. 1917. (1114) A fine & beautiful day.  I was on sick parade today & got my shoulder rubbed with some embrocation & took it easy the rest of the day & had a good sleep. Today I finished reading an Australian Book.  "Ginger Mick" a tale in rhyme by C.J. Dennis of a larrikin who enlisted and done his bit at Gallipoli 
 Wednesday August 22. 1917. (1115) A beautiful day   We were on the usual routine work this morning cleaning harness.  There is to be a route march to morrow & the Transport is to take part in it.  We were paid this morning.  I received 20 francs. 14/8. There is a half holiday this evening, but there is no place within easy walking to go to.

 Thursday August 23. 1917. (1116) We are 9 months in France today.  It is showery.  We are at the usual routine work. Only the coopers & water carts with their drivers had to go on the start today. Bill Grey went on the blighty leave this morning.  The leave train near Bologne colided with an ammunition train & it is reported here that 40 were killed & injured.
