  
 rather an awkward fault too in this sort of country as often there is a shere drop off the road of 10 - 50 feet. It is beautifully cool up here now, in fact it is absolutely cold after Jericho. I have to put everything I have on top of me at nights to keep warm. Tonight, for example, there is a bitterly cold wind & one feels it in a tent, as I am, by myself. But it is much better than Jericho God forbid that I should ever see the place again as a soldier at any
