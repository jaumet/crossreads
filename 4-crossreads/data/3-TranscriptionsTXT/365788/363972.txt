 28 July 16 France. 
 My very dear Irene, Enclosed you will find a little letter which I wrote you We bearers went into action at 6.30 P.M. or earlier on Sunday  &amp; most of us carried from then till about 2.30 P.M. on the following  Wednesday  Tuesday afternoon, some of them having started a few hours before our section. I remained at the scene of Battle with eleven others who were there from the start also, till the following  Thursday  Wednesday morning at about 8.30 A.M. &ndash; Had only three hours sleep since Friday night 22 July. &ndash; Did not feel as tired as one would have expected, till afterwards probably because of the excitement. It sounds a funny thing to say, but really I enjoyed it except for the hard work. It was for all the world like a real hard exciting football match &amp; I would not have missed it for hundreds of pounds.
