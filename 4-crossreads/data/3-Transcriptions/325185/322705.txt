<p>France<br/>11.4.16<br/>Dear Father<br/>Well here goes to give you as good a description of thing as I can. Well we weren't sorry to get away from Egypt I can tell you  The dust was a fair terror.The last place we were at there was any amount of dust &amp;amp: very little water we used to get a quart of water a day that was for drinking washing etc. Needless to say we didn't wash too often. We had a nights travelling by train from our camp in Egypt to the boat &amp;amp: came in open trucks &amp;amp:  it wasint too warm either I can tell you. Then we had six days on the boat. After that three days &amp; nights in the train here. We came practically right across France I thoroughly enjoyed the trip I can tell you. It was pretty cold at night but the days were nice &amp;amp: warm.We dident see much</p>
