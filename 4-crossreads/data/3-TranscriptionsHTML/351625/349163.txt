<p>There are a number of us going in for a bayonet fighting competition next week &amp; if we have the necessary practice every day we have a chance of pulling it off.  Bayonet fighting is very interesting &amp; exciting especially in the advanced stages where we go over the bayonet course in a charge imagining every bag we stick is a real German.  I can quite understand men loosing their head in a real charge, as when we go over the course we go so hard &amp; with such force a grunt or a hiss everytime we bury the bayonet in a bag that our hands are always covered in blood from the skin we nock off with using the rifle so we never notice any hurt until we finish &amp; see the blood.  The Lewis gun is the chief machine gun used at the front now &amp; every infantry man is taught to use it as there is one of these to every platoon at the front &amp; anyone may be put on to it.</p>
