4.  my being able to decide anything that you would understand that it is not an easy thing to settle and takes time.  I have been so grateful to you for it and have longed to cable you so but have wished to have something else to tell you too at the same time.          I have made up my mind to come home but it is qualified by several "ifs."  One is if no word comes from Rid saying that he wants me to stay on or go on to England.  Another is if there anything unexpected should happen that would make it evident that that was not the wisest or best thing to do after all.  I think those are the main qualifications dear people.  But now about any dates.  I have been to Cook's and found out dates of sailing so as to be ready, but my chief difficulty & the one that wi may cause a great deal of delay is getting letters in return to a cable of mine from Rid.  You see he asked me to give him a fortnight's notice, at least, by cable so that he could write me any instructions about leaving money or any other things of the sort.  Now though I might cable him now, if, as it seems, his letters here are blocked I should be stupid & perhaps he might be worried about it.  So you see I must just wait until I know that letters are coming through all right.  The Khyber leaves on 27th. April but that will be too soon now that I am not hearing from Rid.  The next is the "Medina" leaving on May 11th. and that is supposed to leave sail about that date from Port Said though They are not always to date.  I shall aim for that one, though can hardly cable you until I have cabled to Rid & had his answer.     Now my own dear People, though I have said all this much about it & am beginning to feel that really I shall be doing right & what I am meant to do by coming home,
