June 1916 continuedspent, visiting some of the places of interest & although we did not go beyond a mile & a half from the Strand we spent an enjoyable time & visited the Criterion Theatre ("A Little Bit of Fluff") in the evening.We got "bushed" when we came out & it took us the best part of an hour to find our way back to the Hotel although it was only a very short distance.  London at night is not very interesting as all the light are heavily shaded & the streets are crowded with people.  Taxi cabs are flying about everywhere & the buzz & hum of the city never seems to stop.  After listening to the orchestra at the Hotel for a while we went to bed about 11 12.30.   (P.S. "Andy" Fisher visited the Australian troops before we left camp & gave us a hearty welcome.)
