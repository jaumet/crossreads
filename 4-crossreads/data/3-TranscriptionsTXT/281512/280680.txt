I saw a horrible sight take place within about 20 yards of me. 5 Boche prisoners were carrying one of our wounded in to the dressing station, when one of the enemy's own shells struck the group. All were almost instantly killed, three being blown to atoms.   Another shell killed four & I saw them die, frightfully mutilated in the deep slime of a shell crater. How ever anyone escapes being hit by the showers of flying metal is incomprehensible. The battlefield on which we won an advance of 1500 yards, was littered with bits of men, our own & Boche & literally drenched with blood. It almost makes one doubt the very existence of a deity - that such things can go on beneath the omnipotent eye.  I greatly admire the magnificent work of the stretcher bearers who go out in the thick of the strife to succour the wounded.  Germany is done & it is heinous cruel & pitiful
