different departments: AMC (General Hospital) No 1 Cottage  No 2. Cottage, No 1 Contact (which is the Measles Compound) & No 2 Contact (Venereal) & letters simply addressed A.M.C. go from one to the other lying in the orderly tent of each for sometimes a day until they eventually reach their destination.  So I think that while I am in this Dept letters should be addressed Priv. J.L.W. No 1 Contact Measles Contact A.M.C. Liverpool Camp, & then they will be sent over direct.  I saw Walter last night for about 1 1/2 hours.  Expect to be down on Wednesday if I can work it in.  If I am not home by 9 AM. at the latest I won't be coming.I remain,Leo.
