  
 28 September 1918 Saturday (X to X crossed out) Outpost again. Moved back to water & a beautiful Trout stream, with Bamboo etc:- Oleanders & Black berries , found odd wounded Turks, but opposition finished except from Circassian Bedouins - over 40 000 prisoners now & 300 guns.  Thunder storm last night, rainy season commences in a month-   We have little Transport & only carry a Blanket & Oilsheet X Cannot send any letters or receive any from the wife these days but I trust all is well.  I doubt if this reaches you it runs many risks but with love I send it hoping the War may end soon-   Your son FW X
