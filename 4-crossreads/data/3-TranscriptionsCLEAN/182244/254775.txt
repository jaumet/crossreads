Anzac (2)
to do such deeds, as the 25th of April 1915, St Mark's day, saw accomplished by men from Australia & New Zealand, city boys country boys who never before had weilded a bayonet or fired a shot in anger. Officers, many several colleagues of my own, through many many years, non-comissioned officers who served under me through years & years, I salute them all and pay tribute to them as being of the worthiest of the soldiers of all ages.
I thank God, as there is war, that he allowed me to live long enough to land on Galipoli peninsula
