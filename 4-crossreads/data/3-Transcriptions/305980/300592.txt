<p>least twenty to one.  We were holding the flank for the 4th Bde. &amp; were only 37 strong in the line &amp; 4 m. guns.  The 4th absolutely showed the white feather, losing 9 guns &amp; making no attempt to go to their batteries relief, the result being 32 of 4th Bde. &amp; gun crew captured.  This retirement caused an awful mess as the Turks held the main wadi to Es Salt, thus causing much anxiety to our men operating in the hills.  We had to fight a rearguard for a squadron of the 11th, then returned 2 miles to another post, holding this till we were relieved by 6th mtd. Bde. then going into the hills with the N.Z. troops, as we had to hold a line so that our men from Es Salt would not be cut off.  Held our post all night, the enemy being only a mile from our only road of escape from Es Salt.  Gen. Allenby &amp; staff came out this afternoon directing operations for the retirement.  Enemy attacked 4th post &amp; again they retired, having to rely on the guns to knock the Turks off during the night.  Rations are scarce &amp; have not had any rest for two days &amp; nights of constant fighting.</p>
<p>2:  Still on post with N.Z. who have gone in as infantry digging a new track to allow our men to get through from Amman &amp; Es Salt.  Duty all night.</p>
