Wed. Jan. 2. After Break. I went all over Stone in search of a horse & trap, so that we could go for a Drive, but there was not one in the Town. We went into Hanley to see the Pantomime "Tommy Tucker." It was rotten. We sat in the Orchestra Stalls, & it was awfully cold. To make matters worse I sat near the Trombone Player, & every time he played a loud note he nearly blew me out of my seat. We returned to Stone about 5.30. Called in at Pat Astbury’s & had Tea. Then we got the Phonograph going & stayed on & yarned till about 9. Then we had Supper & returned to St Michael’s Lodge. I was jolly tired & glad to get to Bed. Bywe I mean Mrs Ibbs, Harry & I. This for B.E’s information. No doubt I’ll hear about it later.

Thur. JAN. 3. Went to the Potteries to Harry Ibbs’ place. Meat was unprocurable in the Town so we had a "makeshift" dinner, a thing I enjoy more than a set meal. Said "Goodbye" to Mrs Ibbs, Harry & Fanny & returned to Stone. Met Ern Harvey & went Home with him. Mrs Harvey was very nice & made me feel quite at Home. Slept in a big double Bed with only a Hot water bag for company.

FRI. 4. Paid a visit to "Crown & Anchor" Saw Fred Collier & his wife; & of course many other identities. Harry Jones & his wife among them. While Ibby was in Stone, we had our photos taken together but they turned out failures. There’s no doubt about it, I take a rotten photo. At night had a Game Cribbage & a Sing-Song up at Ern’s place.
