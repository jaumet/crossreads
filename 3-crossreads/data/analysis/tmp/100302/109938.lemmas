French soldier in their ungain baggi uniform were on duti on the wharv and all the way along we were welcom by wave hand and hat . The French bayonet is a long fearsom swordlik affair . Gang of English tommi were at work on the pier and poor look specimen they were . The M.R.O 's and Medic Govt peopl were soon aboard . The thing that strike one most about this delight citi is the steep and rag background of the Mighti Alps , - it certain is a place of which a resid could say that he was a citizen of no mean citi .
