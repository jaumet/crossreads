<p>Wednesday May 9th<br/>Review of troops embarking tomorrow practically whole camp will be emptied<br/>Thursday May 10th<br/>Rose at 4AM struck. Marched to station to catch train to board Troopship. At last we are off. On arriving at wharf relatives &amp; friends not permitted on pier. A darn disgrace &amp; insult to the Victorians. Many of who thought relatives would be permitted on wharf. For myself made no difference as I had said good bye. Felt very sorry for others &amp; think it was very harsh of Defence authorities. Moved out from Pier at 12 noon amidst silence. (what a send off. Anchored opposite Sorrento.<br/>Friday May 11th<br/>Very funny last night, swinging Hammocks</p>
