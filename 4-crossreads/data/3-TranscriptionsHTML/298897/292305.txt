<p>our first stop was at Orange where we had tea made for us &amp; so had a quick meal guards being put out to keep the men from slipping off.  After leaving Orange we came to lovely country being in the Valley of the Rhone.  Right up to Paris it was a veritable garden all the way.  Harvesting was in full swing &amp; appeared to be well in hand.  Women girls &amp; children were employed to a great extent, the men being mostly old, altho' a good proportion of soldiers were employed.  The welcome given us by the residents was of the quiet kind until we neared Paris, when the people were more demonstrative.  Everywhere was a general air of peacefulness only the soldiers uniforms &amp; trucks marked "War material urgent" to be seen as a reminder.  We passed several troop trains, most of the men wearing the shrapnel helmets &amp; they as a rule gave us a good cheer.  The roads we saw were good being made of limestone judging by their white colour but were very narrow.  Practically all had trees planted alongside, the roads being a series of long avenues, meeting over head the effect being splendid.  The country carts were peculiar being exceptionally long, like a lorry on two wheels,</p>
