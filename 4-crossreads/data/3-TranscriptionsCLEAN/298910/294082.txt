taken our clothes off for a longer period. Took over Runner Post from 14th, running two Posts with only 4 sets of Bearers - going like fury all the night - sent up for relief about midnight & only got one extra squad of 4. We were all completely done in from ploughing knee deep thro the stiff mud - Absolutely the hardest & most disheartening night we ever put in - our Doctors & N.C.O.'s seemed to be ignorant of the fact that we had to carry from Runners to Dressing Station. We all refused duty at 2-30 am unless we got more men, were told in answer to our deputation that we could have 48 hrs off, so we struggled on. 3 Bearers of B Section got knocked today, 2 seriously & 1 lightly.

Raining & Cold. Went up & Relieved at North Road - Fritz shelling in our vicinity all day - quite monotonous to be always saying we had more narrow escapes. Busy all day & night. Beastly accommodation, feet & clothes wet since I came out, half our bearers getting trench feet, can feel my own feet tingling & swelling. One of the bearers - poor Hopkins who got hit yesterday died before we got in, the other fellow we all think there is no hope for him. Had a busy night.
