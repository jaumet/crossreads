<p>Re losing Horses one gets funny descriptions in Orders sometimes, such as "Bay Geld, an old steeple-chasers <u>so should be easily recognized</u>", another, "Brown Geld etc. <u>a little wild</u>" - this from the Tommies lines &amp; Orders. Expect to move to Beach tomorrow at last. Did not go to Church as a howling Dust Storm blew all the afternoon &amp; we have lost our good old Padre who is now a Major &amp; at DivisionAL Hd.
