mudros island.
today we were inspected By the C.O. of the Convalescent Camp and he marked me C. This makes it the 2nd time that I have been marked  This camp is called the Base Convalescent Camp and it is Situated at mudros west about 60 miles from Gallipoli Peninsula. This island is one mass of tents  When the french get wounded they go home to france and get cured there of their wounds. There is no french hospitals on this island at any rate
