  
 28 big day & am sleepy so go along to Hotel St Jean & find a big room with two double beds & turn in. 
 6 January 1919 Train has left as 6-20 this morning & as I arrive at 8 am I do not catch it. There is some trouble with the ticket & it costs me 12 fr. to go as far as Tille for I will not pay fare right through. As Antwerp is near a trip fills in the morning but there is nothing to say about it except that it is a big commercial city intersected by canals & block with punts & shipping. 
 On return visit museum of old arms & cannons at Port de Hal one of the old gates of the ancient city of Bruxelles. From here you catch a blue tram to the field of (V) Waterloo which does not repay the time (1 hr) spent in reaching it. The pc gives all that is to be seen. 
 On return I take tram to Grimberghen as far as the other side of the city as Tervueren is on south? passing on the way the Royal Park with a grand tower monument & old time plain looking building once a palace, then past Japanese Tower erected as a monument & also a chinese palace. 
 Returning to city I must look around for dinner & find a friend in need who takes me to several places & finally I dine very well in a little restaurant
