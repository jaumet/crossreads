 Chapter 9 
 Suvla Bay 
 From the mountains our lads scanned the tracks from shore, For reinforcements that were to arrive. Though our limbs were weary and our feet were sore,  They  We were as active as bees in a hive, On our sunburnt faces you saw traces of joy, As we glanced at the calm Suvla &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bay, Those troopships we saw, where the sea meets the sky, Had brought thousands to join in the fray, Hope encouraged our boys to continue the fight, Hope was fighting with  the fight  us against fate. Fate won, for help was delayed through the night. The relief, came too late, yes too late. 
 Sgt. Fraser.
