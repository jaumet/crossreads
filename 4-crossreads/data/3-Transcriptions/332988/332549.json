Our duties were to prevent all looting of deserted  and shattered house &amp; shops, and to halt everyone civilians or otherwise who could not produce a pass. The portion of the City which we piqueted was not under heavy shell fire. Occasional shells fired by the Hun to "destroy the morale" of the civilian population were the only things that troubled us. We hardly paid any attention to them but proceeded to make ourselves comfortable. France is a g reat garden country and strawberries, radishes, onions &amp; potatoes were plentiful here. Every man slept between sheets and when not on post might have been seen frying chips potatoes. After a week the Battalion rejoined the Brigade in the farm billets in rear near Baure where after a hot bath and change of underclothes they proceeded to "get fit". Instruction on the Lewis gun, rifle practise and target practise was the chief work during the sixteen days rest in that spot. The weather was splendid and warm and crops and cattle were looking well. From there we proceeded to the line in support of the French. As the sector was not familiar I have forgotten the name. We were favourite wit' the French soldiers. They were splendid soldiers &amp; were quite cheerful for the Hun was not only held but being steadily pressed back on all of the Fronts. The war was lost to him any way. After a week here</p>
