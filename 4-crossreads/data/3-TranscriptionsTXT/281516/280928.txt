 After lunch went to the Baths and had a luxurious soak then proceeded to Armentieres calling upon Mademoiselle at the bookshop. She was looking very nice. Also the library where the charming lady in black presides. The town full of soldiers, transport coming and going. At Burberry paid 29 &frac12; francs for shirt collar and tie. Old French civil guards pottering about on little posts &ndash; clad in their baggy trousers and postman looking uniforms. 
 Coming through La Chapelle some artillery strafing was going on and had to wait till the shells burst less thick around the road. Our gun positions very cleverly concealed in places by dropping a painted curtain over the opening. Left bike heavy shelling of our Bois Grenier line using about 6 inch stuff H.E. admixed [indecipherable] with shrapnel. 
 Bird was wounded in the leg but there were no other casualties. Proposed  trench raid tonight was put off until tomorrow. Stand to arms 9.15 inspected everyone and after that supervised the rum issue. In the company there is hardly a man now who does not draw his issue. When we first went to the Dardanelles there were a good many teetotallers but gradually their scruples have been overcome. 
 I consider the rum issues quite unnecessary and creates an appetite. Something else should substituted for it &ndash; say something extra for breakfast or tea. The rattle of transport resound over the country side at night. Today I heard a train whistling just behind the Germans &amp; also spotted a soldier doing pick &amp; shovel work under a hedge.
