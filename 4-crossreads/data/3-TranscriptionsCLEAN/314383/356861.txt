The mountains & cliffs rise to a tremendous height on either side of the narrow valleys & ones impressions of the day were swift rivers, deep valleys & steep cliffs & razor back ridges.
May 2ndAn awful day, we faced the terrible Pia-Tak pass.  A fairly good road has been constructed over this portion of the track & it   windszig-zags to the heights above.  On the left cliffs tower to the very heavens.  To the right deep valley yawn.
After tea Scott Olsen & I sat on a rock & drank in the wonderful beauties of the place.
Down below, thousands of feet, lay the valley of yesterdays march.  To the right & left tumbled crags rear their shrivelled heads upwards, wind rain snow has carved them into most fantastic shapes.
