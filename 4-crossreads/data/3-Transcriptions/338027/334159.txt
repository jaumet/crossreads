<p>Sunday, 4 April, 1915<br/>C. P. as usual Easter service had some visitors in the p.m.  all is leave is stopped in consequence of riot.</p>
<p>Wrote home in the p. m. frightfully dusty day.</p>
<p>All the infantry from here are going this week but we are the last to go, even the 4th field amb that arrived seven weeks after we did are going before us.  On picquet at night frightful dust storm I took bad, and could hardly finish my second shift, as a matter of fact I did fall asleep but awoke in time to call my next relief.</p>
<p>Monday, 5 April, 1915<br/>Being a brutal day with dust flying everywhere, I reported sick at the hospital, and when Dr [indecipherable] took my temp, he at once ordered me into the Palace Hospital, in Heliopolis.  I have a kind of influenza caused by the sand, and it is very prevalent lately.</p>
<p>The first thing I did when I arrived at the hospital was to have a good hot bath, and I felt cured as soon as I came out.  I am in the best ward of all and have four fine sisters.  My pulse is very low but I can eat all the splendid delicacies provided.  The bed seems unnaturally soft and the food too good, as it is a great comparison with camp diet.</p>
