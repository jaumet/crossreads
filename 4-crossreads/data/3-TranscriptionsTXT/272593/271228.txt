 a good night's work &amp; told me to turn in for the rest of the night,  it was not much use turning in for my dugout was sopping wet &amp; I was even in a worse state for I was covered from head to foot with mud &amp; wet to the skin, but the boys had some nice hot cocoa waiting for me &amp; this helped to thaw me, there is one thing we get now in the trenches &amp; that is the little "Tommy cookers", they are made of paffarin &amp; wax &amp; are put up in little tins, they light instantly &amp; produce no smoke, the "Australian Comforts Funds" send them to us. This morning when I went round for the boys rum I drew a blank for the Q.M. sent a bottle of whale oil instead how they roared when I told them   didn't they perform, reckoned the heads had drunk it &amp; etc
