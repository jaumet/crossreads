<p>1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 1 &nbsp; DEC.</p>
<p>Fine but very foggy all day It was a great day for the 7<s>​​</s><sup>th</sup>&nbsp;FAB. We got out to the artillery range by the &quot;Bustard Inn&quot; about 4 miles away by 10 AM &amp; started our firing about 12.30. We did fairly well considering the rotten conditions. Carrol &amp; Raymond were 7.0.0 &amp; made a mess of things by sending rotten orders. We got back about 2.30 were in stables in afternoon. I was lead driver on the Firing Battery waggon</p>
