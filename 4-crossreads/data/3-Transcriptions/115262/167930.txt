<p>Tuesday 12 June 1917.</p>
<p>Sea rougher than ever and the roughest we have had yet during the voyage. Seas coming&nbsp;<s>in</s>&nbsp;over port&nbsp;<s>the</s> side as much as 5 feet over the&nbsp;<s>outside</s>&nbsp;above railing. Rafts torn away from their lashings &amp; hurled into center of deck. One man washed on to a raft &amp; had clavicle, &amp; 2 ribs broken &amp; a cut head also.</p>
<p>Sighted a liner this morning on port side on horizon. Sea calming down a little in afternoon. We have now passed Cape Gardafui [Cape Guardafui] &amp; things should be a little calmer. Finished correspondence for this mail this afternoon. 2 boxing contests coming off. Extra large flying fish seen today.</p>
