  
 on the deck that night and watched the light and I think some of us felt what is termed on board a little bit sloppy, one gets like that occasionally. 
 We have been told what is to be our first port of call but beyond that we know nothing and it appears pretty certain that no one on board knows any more than we do. 
 It is getting pretty hot now and everything feels clammy and rather unpleasant.  Drill hours have been curtailed;  we now parade 6.30-7.15, 9.30-11, 2.30-4, and do not do any strenuous exercises.  I am inclined to think myself that the hours are a little too short.  The men would be just as happy on parade and it keeps them away from mischief.  It is impossible to stop gambling on board and of course  it is  the stakes will probably be too high for some of the men. 
 It is rather difficult writing an about-to-be-censored letter.  I think I have said about all there is to say. 
 Will you remember me kindly to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy, Keith and also Whitfeld. 
 Yours very sincerely C.R. Lucas
