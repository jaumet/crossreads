<p>April 1917<br/>hardly a pleasure trip.  The dust was blinding &amp; choking &amp; the halts &amp; interruptions frequent.  In addition the night was cold &amp; we were all tired.  We watered in the Wadi &amp; it was just then 2 enemy aeroplanes spotted us &amp; down came the bombs.  One killed &amp; wounded 20 men &amp; 18 horses, most of them belonging to Brigade Headquarters.  The day <strike>Monday</strike> Tuesday 17th was very hot with hardly a breath of air.  We got no time to boil any tea &amp; nearly everyone was suffering a good deal.</p>
<p>After frequent halts of varying lengths we got into touch with the Turks near Abu Hareira there was a bit of a skirmish &amp; some artillery fire.  We got a good well with splendid water.  After dark we came back &amp; camped near the Wadi.  It was 11.30 when we got to sleep.</p>
<p>Wednesday 18th<br/>We were out again at daylight, watered our horses &amp; managed to get a shave &amp; a wash.  A plane came over &amp; dropped more bombs but did no damage.  We went out again towards Abu Hareira, got in touch with the Turks &amp; stayed there till dark.</p>
