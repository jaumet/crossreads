<p>Lang Syne could be heard from one end to the other.</p>
<p>New Years day saw a half holiday to all hands, which event was celebrated by a cricket match 13th V 14th battalion. Deck cricket of course is a very well known pastime but this particular game may perhaps be distinguished by the keen interest<br/><strike>mustered</strike> displayed by the partisans of both sides. Excitement was keen as wicket after wicket of the 14th who batted first fell, and when the last wicket fell for 7, the 13th were jubilant, but alas wickets fell equally rapidly and 1 was still required to equalise when the last man Sgt Momson hero of many fights went in. And great excitement he got 1, and then the innings ended 7 all. At the next knock, runs came more freely and the 14th made 23 and the hopes of NSW went down to zero. But yet once again the runs came freely and with a total of 41, the 13th won by a handsome total of 18.</p>
