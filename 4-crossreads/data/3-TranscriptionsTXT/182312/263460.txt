 once a week are another good idea and in addition to reducing our meat 
 requirements by a seventh will probably do our constitution no little

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there is the question of the cultivation of the British 
 Isles.&nbsp; Thousands of acres are lying idle which should long ago have 
 been put to use.&nbsp; The Farmers say that they cannot secure sufficient 
 labour.&nbsp; Then it must be found for them.&nbsp; France is densely cultivated 
 not an acre being wasted and this with EVERY MAN of military age at war 
 or war work.&nbsp; Who then does the farming?&nbsp; The women, the children and the old men and they will have to do it in the British Isles.&nbsp; In

 wants doing and they will do it.&nbsp; So far no attempt seems to have 
 been made to organise this voluntary labour and it is a matter which 
 wants attending to at once.&nbsp; The British woman is no sluggard, give 
 her a job and she will master it in no time;&nbsp; this much she has proved
