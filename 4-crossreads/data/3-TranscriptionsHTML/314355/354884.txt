<p>Deep shadows about the black beamed roof, and along the floor and the walls: a yellow light gilding and shadowing brown burned faces and richly colouring splendid knees.  One lad had thick black hair, and its lustre over his forehead reminded me of one of Sautars [?] masks in the Amiens gallery.</p>

<p>July 8<br/>255.<br/>In the night:  a day of home's January ended &ndash; and in rain, all day long a still haze over the world and a sun of hot fire slowly travelling the skies.  No movement in the trees or across the fields still unscaped, then a thunder clap, lightning and heavy reluctant rain.</p>
<p>To Hondeghem and met there some of the Seaforths just from the line, about the country till we found a farmhouse where pale yellow wine was selling.</p>
