 boy. You & Mrs Ferguson should not regret his loss, you should be proud of him in Death as I am sure you were in Life. I can hope for nothing better for my Son than that he may live & die as nobly as yours did. 
 I am going to Australia next month & I will call & see you if I may. 
 I wrote to Mr King the Head Master at Clifton & I enclose his letter. I think it will give you all the information available. 
 Believe me Sincerely Yours C F Warren Lieut Colonel.
