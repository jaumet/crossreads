  
 your own discretion about it. 
 It is a pity I am just a bit too late for the Silver Wedding - Helen said you looked quite young - "as young as Hazel or I" were her words, but better luck next time. I may be there for the Golden wedding. 
 Well, Mother, there is not much news to tell you now - I'll talk plenty when I get home - which I hope will be this week sometime. 
 With Love to all the family - and Helen if she is still at Dene Gully 
 Your loving son. Alan. 
 PS I do not want to upset any arrangements Dene may have made re that little matter, but thought I would mention it in case Dene did not know what to do with all his money. Does he know when he is going away? I'm afraid this is rather a scrawl, but it is cold here and my hand is nearly numb. My word it gives us some 'hurry up" in the mornings when we roll out for our wash & breakfast not to mention doing sentry all hours of the night.
