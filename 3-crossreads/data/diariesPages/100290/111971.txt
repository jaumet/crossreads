Saturday
Off duty at 8 a.m. Tony's unit camped alongside us last night. Had a good old yarn to him. They move back this morning. also our tent division clearing hospital handed over to 4th field. Stretcher bearers remain behind. Say farewell to Tony. I wonder how long it will be before we see each other again.
