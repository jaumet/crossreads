<p>Friday 27 September<br/>Early this morning we arrived at Pont Remy where we are now living.  We have been house hunting all day, funniest experience imaginable &amp; finally got a nice room with nice people. This village on the river is pretty, 8 kilos from Abbeville but is full of all kinds of people, including W.A.A.Cs. Thank Heaven for a sight of civilization again.</p>
