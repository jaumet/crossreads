 My dearest Father, Just a short note before the mail closes.  Yesterday I was appointed to the Orderly Room as combined clerk & orderly.  I help at times with the mails (despatching of them) & at any other odd jobs that present themselves.  Needless to say I am having a good time, but won't be sorry when we get word to join our Unit.  I have heard that our Unit (viz 1st. Field Ambulance) is at Ismalia where our men are massing.  We are almost daily expecting to hear of a clash between our men & the Arabs & Turks combined.  We are enjoying lovely weather here & I am in splendid health.  I had a good Christmas in spite of position of affairs.  We had a very decent dinner of fowl & ham & pudding. After dinner I spent the afternoon reading & dozing in my tent.  After tea a few of us walked into Heliopolis for a stroll & to see the sights.  The following day Sunday was spent much the same way only that I turned into bed with a book soon after tea instead of going out. I notice the weather is gradually getting colder especially of a night.  Must close, with love to all at home, Your loving son, Leo.
