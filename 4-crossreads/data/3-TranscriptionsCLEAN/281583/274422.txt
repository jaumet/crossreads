  
 There was evidently a big stunt on, the news of which has not yet come through. It is still proceeding & the fire is growing in intensity. There was a serious raid by Aeroplanes & we were kept on the hop. They dropped bombs all over the place & a few fell on a Field Hospital about 700 yards from us & killed 8 AMC men & wounded 45 others including a lot of patients. Guns were screeching all round us, while the rattle of machines guns on the Aeroplanes could be distinctly heard as they engaged one another. 
 One Taube was seen to fall in flames & explode when it hit the ground. On the whole it has been a terrible night, & I would be glad to see the clouds over the moon & put an end to midnight raids. One can stand them in daylight, but they are uncanny at night.  Meanwhile the fighting still proceeds & before the next 14 days are over, Baupaume should be ours,. 
 My cold is still very troublesome & does not seems to mend, but it is the constant trudging about in the wet which does. It.
