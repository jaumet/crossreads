<p>Friday 5 January</p>
<p>Water fatigue drawing water from the well and filling the carts.  Last time we were on this job we had two oil drums and two kerosene tins on the rope, but all were missing when we were ready to start work.  I was therefore asked to cut the tops off more drums and clean them out.  Went into Vignacourt for tea and afterwards visited the local small Picture Show in company with three others from our unit.<br/>The weather today was glorious.</p>
