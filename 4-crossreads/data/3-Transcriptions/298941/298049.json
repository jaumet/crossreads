<p>Sunday 28 April<br/>Route march in morning. Watched socker match in <strike>morning</strike> afternoon between our team &amp; that of the the erection balloon staff. Our chaps were all over them! Speculation in billet afterwards, on the composition of our team --- <strike>mos</strike> all English-Australian.<br/>In the evening a terrific bombardment started which seemed to be in the direction of Kemmel first but spread to the front opposite here &ndash; Meteren.</p>
