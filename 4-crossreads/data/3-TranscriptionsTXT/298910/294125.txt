Thursday  29/3/17
Dull day, cold & drizzling rain. Rest of the ambulance - excepting a small party left behind to run the Station at Bernafay terminus under Major Pigdon, left for Bapaume to make 15th H.Q. there. Myself & a lot of others left for Buigny to make up a team of mobile Bearers. Only a few casualtys. Altho the roads are good in places & much superior to what we have been used to, but the amount of traffic & the drizzling rain makes it very slushy & our feet never dry. Fritz shelling around us very freely with big stuff.
Friday  30/3/17
Dull - cold & drizzling rain. Very few casualtys. Drinking water hard to get hold of - so many traps of filth etc. Harry Ramsden found some womens clothes in Labarcoque & dressed up in them, he did look a break up even made the Adjutant laugh. Heavy firing at night.
