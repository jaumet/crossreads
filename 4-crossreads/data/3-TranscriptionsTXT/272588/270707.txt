 Thursday 26 May Most glorious Sydney day to-day &amp; the temp. was up very high.  Practically no shells fired all day, but things livened up near the Gare de Strazeele to-night. Still no wounded. Identification of troops opposing is wanted &amp; perhaps a raid will be necessary to-morrow night.  No raid is necessary now as identification was established by a Fritz being killed &amp; his papers taken. 
 Friday 17 May Glorious weather &amp; still no cases. To-day Fritz has been shelling round about the station &amp; has set fire to big stores, sheds &amp; houses.  In fact the fire about one hundred yards from here was a beauty.
