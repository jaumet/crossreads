 Sunday 13 February, 1916 
 Got fed up with camp so decided to walk to Ismalia to get a good feed. I covered 26 miles, 2/3 of which was desert, in 11 hours (some going). 
 Left camp 12 midday arrived at Ismalia about 3.30, left for home about 7 p.m. arrived&nbsp;at 11 p.m. 
 In town I met Harry Glover who&nbsp;is a 1 st  Lieut in the 2 nd  division artillery. I also met Bombadier Baselly &amp; his friend Ives from the Egmont for our last meeting see Monday Jan 3 rd  &#39;16) we had a good yarn &amp; something to eat in lieu of a drink, we were very pleased to see each other again &amp; he invited me on board Egmont. 
 The walk I did today is the stiffest I have ever tackled &amp; I feel quite proud of myself. I also met -----Robinson, a friend of Ken Hamiltons. It is a small world.
