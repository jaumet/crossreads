The town of Alexandria like Port Said. Some streets clean but narrow, but on the whole narrow, dirty & filty & great poverty. Native cafes similar. Least said the better.
Feb. 3Left Ismalia (on Sunday) & per usual for (very peculear each shift happens on Sunday) Port Said through the Suez Cannel. Passed some Australians camped on the bank. As soon as they saw we were an Australian ship they sang out Wish you were going the other way. How is Sydney.5pm moored at Port Said.
Feb 4Left Port Said 10am for Alexandria & steamed out to end of swept channel so as to form the convey. We were the 1st ship out & proceeded 12 miles from Port out of the swept channel. Signals by Hellograph to return to port as soon as possible. Full speed turned around & back for all we were worth with 2 destroyers following. Everyone asking one another what is the reason etc. No one seemed to know. A party asked me. I said "Fritz". In we went for all we were worth after being away 4 hours & remoored for the night. Found out afterwards a nest of submarines were awaiting for us within a few miles.
Sun Feb 5Left Port Said again under coney we being the guide & leading ship. Indarra, Canberra, Omrah & Hamm. Conveyed by 2 Greek destroyers & one British sloop.
