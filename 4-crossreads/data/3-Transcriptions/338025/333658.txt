<p>Wednesday 11th April 1917<br/>Bapeaume<br/>Fixing the "Donk" lines and racks for the harness. After dinner, took a load of ammunition (18lb.shrapnell) to the forward dump. Arr. back in camp about 6pm. Camped just beside sugar refining works, (which is like the rest of the town in ruins. Town in awful state so far I have not seen a house that has escaped the terrible shell force)</p>
