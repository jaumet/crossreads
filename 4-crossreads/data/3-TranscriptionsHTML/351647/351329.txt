<p>Field<br/>4 October</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>Yours of 21st July to hand much thanks merci beaucoup, Madame, vous etes une belle briquette vraiment.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear of the jolly time time you had in Sydney, I read in the paper about the hat being sold, also about Mrs. Somebody's dance at which Mrs. Robertson of <u>"Loggenmuir"</u>! was present.  I shrieked.</p>
<p>Also thanks for the snaps of you, Graham &amp; Capt. Clifford.  I couldn't see very much of you not near enough of your face I mean, Graham looks very cute.  The gallant Captain looks a very charming fellow so far as I can judge.  Charlie Byrne is a bit like John Ellis in figure, his face hasn't quite the same roundness but I suppose he has ways like our one &amp; only Jock.</p>
<p>I'm glad you've had more rain, a good season should ensue &amp; I'm sure I hope so.  Hope the Boss makes lots &amp; lots of hay.  If only old Telleraga would buck up.</p>
