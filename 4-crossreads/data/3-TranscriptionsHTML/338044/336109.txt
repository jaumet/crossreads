<p>4th Nov:-<br/>Again sick Parade &amp; I get out of work until 9 pm. A route march follows 9.30 am across the desert &amp;  over good roads &amp; country village, through cornfields  &amp;  sugar cane to Cleopatra's Needle or the Obelisk, arriving back at camp we passed through a cloud of locusts, thousands of them  A remarkable thing about these parts is that the cornfields and farms are not fenced in, but border the roads on either side. Here must be honor amongst-thieves, if you like. Kitchener's Nile irrigation scheme is responsible for this fertility. In the afternoon we had another lecture and at 6-30 pm I arrived in  Cairo to meet P de Mestre, who took me out to Kasir-l-Ani Hospital (a British Hospital) &amp; I have met a very nice sister (S. Stonehill-Brown)    &amp; also amused the sick Tommies</p>
