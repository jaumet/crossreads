<p>JANUARY 1917</p>
<p>5 FRIDAY</p>
<p>Fine,&nbsp;<s>but dull &amp; cold</s>&nbsp;and sunny</p>
<p>but rained at night. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness all the morning. The</p>
<p>order came at dinner time</p>
<p>that we were to go to the 26<sup>th</sup></p>
<p>in the afternoon, so we got all</p>
<p>our gear packed &amp; the left</p>
<p>section went over. Their billet</p>
<p>is not nearly as good as ours</p>
<p>was, &amp; we were crowed up like</p>
<p>sardines. Lieut. Rourke is our</p>
<p>section commander. There were</p>
<p>some German &#39;planes came</p>
<p>over us, some in morning &amp;</p>
<p>some in afternoon &amp; the anti-</p>
<p>aircraft guns were shelling them.</p>
