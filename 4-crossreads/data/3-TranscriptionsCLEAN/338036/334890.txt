[4th April contd]2 hrs to fix him up.  Unfortunately he had lost too much blood & he died soon after.  Later in the day had the painful task of going thro his correspondence prior to sending it on.  Went to Bailleul on one of our Ambulances this afternoon with patients & there saw a Fritzs plane that had been brought down by one of ours.
Friday 6thWhen we awoke it was to hear anti aircraft guns going their hardest & we could hear nose caps & shrapnel falling all round us.  By the way I might mention that the roof of out billet was of ruberoid stuff & wouldn't stand too much.  Someone informed that it was Good Friday but what difference to others we have had.
SHELLING PONT NIEPPE HEAVILY
During the day General Porter [?] D.M.S. inspected the hospital.
Sat 7th  Easter Saturdaybut nothing to identify it as such.  Fritz sent over 100 shells into Pont de Nieppe this morning & only damaged the wheel of a gun & in addition did not cause an injury to a single man.  Towards night five Fritzs fought two of ours & after a good scrap ours were sent to ground (one on fire)  A squadron of our planes settled 3 Fritzs balloons.
Sunday 8thVery busy about midday.
