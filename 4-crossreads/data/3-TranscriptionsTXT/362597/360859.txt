except when on fatigue. We are having a lovely time & it is just like a picnic.
The sea is a bit choppy just now but we do not get sick as we are quite used to it. We walk about the deck just as if we were on dry land. Sometimes when she is rolling about & the linoleum is wet we slide about but that is only fun.
We are more than half-way on our journey at this time & only hope that the second half is as good as the first half. We have not seen a vessel since we left W.A. We often see a star very low down & think it is a light.
