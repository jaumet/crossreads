<p>Bulford<br/>26.1.19</p>
<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>I have to resort to this method of answering my mail.  I will give you most of the experiences &amp; peregrinations since leaving Havre &amp; you will compris how busy I have been.</p>
<p>On the last day at Sanvic, I reached the height of my glory in the army by being dubbed a Buglar by the Quarter-Bloke as we named Him.  He fought at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir 40 years ago &amp; wears enough ribbons of decoration to make a fair sized Union Jack, so He ought to know.  I wanted some equipment &amp; in the army very often there is only one of getting it &amp; I was caught in the act being only a probationer to the "Profession" as yet.  On returning from the Y.M.C.A. late that evening, 14.1.19 I was warned to be ready to march out at 8.30 next morning.  At 9.30 we got away &amp; on board a Hospital the "St Patrick" one of the G. Western Railway Steamers.  There we lay until 1 p.m. but I was able to get dinner over before we embarked, dinner for the Patients, 300 odd, that I was responsible to the Doctor for proper attention as to Treatment, meals &amp; accomodation.  We were entertained by 2000 Chinese who were embarking on the "Empress of Russia", a mammoth Liner of 30,000 for China.  Every Kind of dress of every nation was to be seen &amp; every hat from a diggers, "Aussie Soldiers" to Fritz's Cap &amp; even to enamel washing basins &amp; Tin Hats.  I had dinner with the officers there being no Sergeants mess.  I did not feel too happy about it but with everything so nice I was tempted to eat.  After dinner, my staff in company with the Ship's Staff set about getting the Patients to bed &amp; quarters as we were expecting a rough trip.  We got 'em nearly all down by 4 o'clock.  Tea for officers only but as I was a partaker of the meal being attached for Duty as is the usual custom on Hospital ship.  It was kicking up a bit at that time &amp; the mess was [indecipherable]</p>
