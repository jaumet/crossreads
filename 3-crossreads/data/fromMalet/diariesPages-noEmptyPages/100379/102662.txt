1st April 1917. April Fool's day. We are darn fools to be here instead of Australia. Went down to trenches at 8.45. At our OP all the morning doing sweet F.A. came back at 2.30 had dinner. We received a gramophone today from the Comforts Fund. Had an impromptu concert with all in the mess at night. Its great to hear some good music on this game. After supper went to bed at 9.30.
2nd April 1917. Got up at 8.15 cleaned up. Left for trenches at 12.45. Did not do much down there. Bitterly cold with heavy wind. Later on it snowed heavily. Old Fritz shelled our position (OP) late this afternoon. Lobbed a couple of 4.2's over without doing any harm. Walked back to Battery loaded up with telescope etc in a blinding snow storm. Looked like a regular father Xmas when I got back. Had tea at estaminet. After some supper of porridge went to bed
3rd April 1917. Got up at 8.15. Very easy day on F.A. Snowed rained blew like fury nearly all day. Somewhat brighter late this afternoon. Received letter from Katherine.
4th April 1917. Got up at 8 had breakfast. Went down to trenches at 9 stayed on duty till relief at 1.30. Fritz busy all morning with Minnies shrapnel. We retaliated muchly. Had a rest afternoon till supper time..
