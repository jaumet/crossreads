 It is just eight weeks since we set out from Devonport.  What promised to be a slow & monotonous voyage, has certainly been slow but (thanks to the Padre) far from monotonous. 
 It is now over, save for the all-important arrival, and we are all grateful for the protection, guidance & salvation which He has given us.
