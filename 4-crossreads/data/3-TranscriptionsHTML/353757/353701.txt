<p>This pellet hit my cap badge, cut the chinstrap (which was over the peak) right through &amp; bent the badge double resulting only in a temporary "knocked out" feeling &amp; headache for me.  This might interest you.  At "Lone Pine", about which you'll no doubt have read, I got a bullet at close range through my hat &amp; had my rifle smashed to old iron &amp; matchwood with a shell.  Everyone who lived through those five days (6-11 Augt.) had narrow escapes and many went out for all time.  We won the position though at what cost you'll see by the lists for 1st Brigade casualties.  Have some good curios, Turkish ring, coins &amp; a medal among them but they're too weighty to send home.</p>
<p>What about the Labour Govt. now?  My old man always told me.  "There won't be any money in the country in a year".  Looks good, doesn't it, when 400,000 quid can be collected in N.S.W. alone.</p>

<p>Very interested in your paragraph on Royal Commisn. on concentration camp at Holdsworthy.  Just like the treatment a long suffering public would get from a country who acts like they did at the stadium.</p>
<p>A quiet word re Roy Smith.  He was wounded alongside me on the night of land (25 April) &amp; went away to hospital.  He was better in a month &amp; has been enjoying himself in Alexandria ever since.  He hasn't done any scrapping &amp; is not likely to.  Anyway, its like his gory hide to write to the paper &amp; make public an accident to myself which I didn't</p>
