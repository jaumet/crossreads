<p>9/4/18 &ndash; Amiens-Albert Road<br/>Gooley and his flock got down here about 1 a.m. and we saw the men more or less stowed round the trenches.  Some of them just slept out in the open anywhere.  Put old Dooley to bed in a blanket and gave him and the others a drink.  Sparrow has a neat hole drilled right through his steel helmet when he was "en occasion" up at the front.  A marvellous escape.  Rodda got in alright and settled down.  Just before dawn the Hun commenced a furious bombardment &amp; rained small calibre shells admixed with gas on to us.  We had to suck our gas tubes.  A dense fog came on and the barrage made much smoke.  All</p>
