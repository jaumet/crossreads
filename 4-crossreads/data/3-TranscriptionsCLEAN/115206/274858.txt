 Ahead of Busigny Bty Position Weather wet and showery all day. Bty did a few small duty shoots. Tom and myself went forward to dig a position for our advanced pit. Had a fairly easy day considering the circumstances. Had a nice long shift 12 to 4 this morning . expect to be moving up very shortly to a position 800 yds behind the line. One section is to, I believe go forward.
