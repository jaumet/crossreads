 Many happy returns today to my Sweet Kathleen Monica. God bless her. The wind howls in gusts. The air grows cold. It is necessary for me to be astir at 6 A.M. tomorrow. Good night. Good night. Good Night. [Three groups of Xs and Os] Caroline. Josephine. Kathleen. 
 20-10-15 &ndash; 5-10 p.m. On this 20th of October what have I been doing? Wednesday. A priest, Maltese by birth and residence, told me yesterday, that he was to say Mass this morning, in a cutting in the side of the hill behind his hut at 7 o'clock. I was up to time. A Maltese officer with several of his countrymen who are working here were present. The priest asked me to serve and I did so. 
 Breakfast over I walked up Rest Gully to the abode of Dr. Millard. Called to see &amp; speak with General Legge. Sorry to note that he is not keeping free from the prevailing sicknesses. He told me that he has rheumatic pains, skin irritation, and enteritis. Hope that he will soon be improved because he should know his work well. 
 On my road up the valley a man was shot close to me. A bullet passed through his thigh. He was taken to the casualty hospital near by. Millard and I soon set out for a round of the trench area to which I had not been before. I found the crosses which marked the resting places for the bodies of Colonel MacLaurin, Col. Onslow Thompson, having previously seen that of Col. Braund. Millard took photographs of each of these &amp; when I have the negatives developed I shall said the pictures to you
