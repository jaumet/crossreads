 Reveille at 6 
 Stables as usual then riding under Bert M we went on a touring expedition round the hills we got several miles to the rear [indecipherable] visible from camp - about 5 miles to the south men explored the catacombs round about, then the quarries these quarries have been in existence for centuries & in some places they run in to the hills for yards & in many cases the hill that once was is leveled to the level of the dessert.  The criminals from the [indecipherable] prison attend to all the quarrying & the worst type are clothed in red to make them conspicuous their boots are also studded in such a manner as to make them a cert for recapture providing they get away.  In the afternoon Harry L & I have the afternoon off so fill in the time at cooking , try two suet puddings & they turn out tip-top only we have to wait until evening parade is over.   Bed 10.5
