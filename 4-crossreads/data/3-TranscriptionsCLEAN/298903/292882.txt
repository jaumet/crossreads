Have just finished a book "Paul Stranger" by Louise Brown very good scenes around Melbourne.
Tuesday 18th Feb.. Snow falling again.  Set off about 9.30 to catch the 10.10 train to Fovant but was nearly stopped altogether by the Adjutant who said he had no authority to let me go.  Reached Salisbury then changed for a Fovant train arriving at the camp about 2 p.m. First had dinner at the mess and then reported, pleased to see dozens of our chaps who had left a couple of months ago and who were still waiting for boats, the strike etc. holding them up.  At night went to the Y.M. & listened to a lecture by an Indian doctor on India.
Wednesday 19th Feb
After parade in the morning went for a walk  & later received my mail from London and also 5 from S.M. & Co.  Went to pictures at night a real good show.  Put in an application for leave for 14 days to commence from Friday next.  Weather wet and depressing.
