1915Aug. 24 Tue.Every day I whack away at Le Fran&ccedil;ais and if I can't speak it fluently before leaving Egypt I shall eat my hat.Went in to Imp. Scouts Assn. meeting to-night at the Y.M.C.A. but only one other chap turned up. The troops are continually on the move & it seems impossible to get the chaps together at present.Had one of my close crop hair cuts at the Sphinx Hairdressing Saloon (an Italian joint.)
