  
 Bulford 18-2-17 Sunday. Dear Dad, We are having pretty fair weather just now.  We had rain on Friday night for the first time since Jany 12th.  But we had 2 days snowing.  It has been quite warm I think.  I am still wearing calico drawers.  I have not used my woollen underpants yet.  I made some more sateen underpants .  I ripped most of the others to pieces.  They were 18 months old.   Ellis has gone to Amesbury for a walk with Ern. Thomas.  I am trying to answer all my letters to-night but I have only written to Auntie Annie   &   Mum so far.  I have just had supper on Cocoa   &   Soda Biscuits, butter   &   cheese with some of your cake to finish.  We live pretty well.  We always keep something dainty in the Cupboard. I can just imagine Mac's Cart.  He is the greatest slap-dab artist I ever knew.  I have sent an Enquiry card through to H. Q. about Pte Wall, but have had no reply as yet. The money has come through all right.  It will be very handy if ever we get the luck to go to Grimsby or the Island again.  Only two days leave is granted to anyone at present, so there is no chance of getting to either place just yet.  I am glad you watched Sandy as I told
