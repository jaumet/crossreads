1916 December 11Monday
Had a carry before breakfast. 14 of fatigue party lost their way in early morning & wandered into German lines. 6 returned 5 missing & 2 or 3 wounded one succeeding in getting back. shot thro hip. Very wet & slushy underfoot. Stuffed roast & potatoes for dinner. We are living like fighting cocks this past week doing our own cooking. Reynold's squad had narrow escapes coming up with rations after dark, Fritz shells lob in front & behind. Rattled them all.
