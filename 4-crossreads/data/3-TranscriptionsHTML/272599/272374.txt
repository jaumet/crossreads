<p>April Friday 13 1917</p>
<p>Duties per usual.<br/>Roam up the village street in evening.   Such a desolate scene, not a house left standing either burnt down or blown up, &amp; all trees etc. cut down or hacked about.   Fritz even levelled every telegraph pole, cutting them off about 5 ft from the ground with some explosive &amp; systematically smashing every insulator with a hammer.   The local church of Beugny (this village) he left in absolute ruins, blowing it sky hight.<br/>'Tis reported that the last ground of the 4th Div. has been retaken.   Great victories reported round Arras thousands of prisoners &amp; many guns.</p>
