 Dear George, This is not a very nice Picture to send but arabic funerals are so funny &amp; we have seen so many that I wanted something to remember the sights by. How is Andrews Bros getting along? Do you have to do a.m.c. Work now. I suppose the beach is just the same. I have bonza hours now 5.30 to 7.30, 9 to 10 &amp; 3.30 to 4.30. We have shifted our tent again. This is the 4th new position we have taken up. The people both men &amp; women are singing &amp; crying out &amp; going on with all sorts of tricks. The corpse is not buried in a coffin. They take it out &amp; stand it up in the grave &amp; use the coffin till it is worn out. Well George, the best of Luck &amp; you are to stay at Home to look after Dad &amp; Mum. We are doing enough here for our family. Regards to Lily &amp; yourself from your loving Brother Harry.
