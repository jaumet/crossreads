 My Dear Ones, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Now just a few impressions of Capetown, and its surroundings, such of course, as I was able to see in the very little time that was absolutely at my disposal. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &#39;Twas 9-30 on a fine night when I saw my first little piece of Africa; it was the Port Elizabeth Light House and from then on we coasted along always in view of the Great Hills of Africa which rose to our view with the dawn. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; During the 13th of July we had much company, sighting other steamers so often that it ceased to be a novelty and our field glasses were turned in other directions.&nbsp; Some diversion was caused by a shoal of porpoises racing up to us from somewhere astern, playing and racing round us for ten minutes, then leaving to feed upon the rubbish we had thrown overboard.&nbsp; The day was given up to sightseeing, field glasses were turned toward and cameras snapped at the Great Hills of Africa; as we coasted we would see roads running along the cliffs parrallel to but a hundred feet above the sea, tracing a resemblance in the outline of the cliffs to a Lion, the Twelve Apostles, and others. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; At last rounding Sea Point we came in view of Capetown, prettily and cosily snug under Table Mountain
