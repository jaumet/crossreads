road, where we discover many of the enemy dead.  I see the leg of one man move so with the assistance of another chap, haul him out from under a couple of bodies, and find that he is practically unhurt.  He is lying face down in the mud, so after he turns over up go his hands, my bayonet unpleasantly (for him) close to his stomach.  Poor chap, the look of abject terror in his eyes, his whole body shaking and teeth chattering with fear, made me burst out laughing.  It seemed so absurd that I (5 ft. 33/4 ins.) should have this big man at my feet crying for mercy.  He fairly howled.  I had no intention of harming him, unless he showed signs of treachery.  I could'nt do it in cold blood like that, no fear!
After taking from him all his bombs, revolver and anything else that we thought necessary for our personal safety, we compelled him to accompany us to our objective.  He was a fine big chap, very fat, therefore most useful to hide behind for the balance of the journey.
On arrival at our objective I set him to work digging a dug-out for me.  It is daylight now.
We did not stop at our objective, our blood was up and nothing could hold us back.  The excitement was paralizing.  We continued on after the fast retreating enemy.  We could see him removing some of his big guns, we wanted to get those, but unfortunately our wall of flame, which was now stationary, barred our way so we had perforce to return to the trench we had taken.
My prisoner (Horatio, we christened him) had worked well, and had quietened down considerably.  He was a jolly old chap.  Wish I could have kept him as a souvenir.
Prisoners which had been collected were being escorted back over the ground which we had just "taken", but I refused to let Horatio go until he had completed the job.
The signallers got to work at once connecting our new trench with the artillery and headquarters by field telephone.
