The fine weather has evidently passed for today is wet and windy. Rode down to the "B" Co and found all there all early on at work Had my groom Murphy back again today from leave. Most of the farmers are ploughing but there is no trouble in getting parade grounds so far. Visited A. D. Coys at their work also inspected the Regimental Canteen. At 10.45 inspected the Schools of Instruction ? Scout, N.C.Os and Signallers ? who were drawn up under their officers. The Band played during the inspection and then the Adjutant closed the parade to close column and I addressed them. Headed by the band looking very smart they marched back to the village and dismissed Colonel
