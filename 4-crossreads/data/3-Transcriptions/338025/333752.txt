<p>Saturday 28th July 1917<br/>Dickebusch<br/>Grooming and harness cleaning. Shortly after midnight the camp was roused as Fritz was sending Gas shells over to Dickebusch and we got a wiff of it. As it got very strong I put on my mask for an &frac12; hour. Boys coughing and sneezing.</p>
<p>Sunday 29th<br/>Left camp about 6am and marched to Reninghelst where we had a good hot bath. Left baths at 9.30 am very heavy storm was drenched coming home.</p>
