Tuesday 9 May 1916A wintry day with a good deal of rain at intervals. As soon as breakfast was over had to go up to Etaples Old Camp to the Court Martial Hut to attend a court martial on one of my men.  Was kept standing outside in the rain for over 3 hrs., & when the case was over went into Etaples with Lt. Moors for lunch at the "Ioos", a picturesque old inn with quite grotesque paintings on the wall, an abbe drinking liqueur & taking snuff, 2 Parisian ladies discussing latest fashions, a French officer thoughtfully taking his wine, & a heterogeneous assemblage of officers & N.C.O.s. On arrival at home found trouble from the sgts awaiting me.Outward mail for Australia.
