<p><strike>Return to town</strike><br/>Went to Hyde Park Church Parade as I did 15 years ago, then lunched (with Dolly of course) at Hyde Park Hotel.<br/>Afterwards went to Miss Kate Pattersons Flat for Tea meeting Laura, Connie, &amp; Rupert Mathews there-<br/>Was much interested in the lap dog crowd of well dressed men &amp; women in the ROW.<br/>Last nights party with Laura was very enjoyable, it is wonderful how she keeps going.<br/>Poor Aunt A gets assistance from the <strike>Ladies</strike> Gentle womans Aid fund -   They always want to borrow I have none to lend especially now.</p>
