<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our first call was on the Colonel, who after giving us the New Year Greetings joined us like the fine old sport he is, then the &quot;Doc&quot; who seemed to be waiting for us.&nbsp; Then here and there at many billets we called, some officers joining up, others refusing, these last we subjected to some trifling torture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; At midnight the bells from the church pealed, the Battalion band turned out and soon the muddy streets of this dull old village were alive.&nbsp; Candles, flares, pocket torches provided light and everyone in a happy frame giving each other &quot;Happy New Year&quot; and supplementing it with the very popular phrase, &quot;We will get Home this year.&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after we were in bed and on New Year&#39;s Day started the year well with the unaccustomed luxury of a &quot;lie-in&quot; until nine o&#39;clock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next New Year&#39;s Day at Home - it is good to think on isn&#39;t it&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With best wishes,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold.</p>
