  
 Easter Sunday Khan Yunis The enemy 'planes are very active now, one came & saw us off when we left Sheikh Zowaiid & again saw us into camp here, so they know all about us. The railway goes on from here - I understand for about 5-6 miles & ends about 400 yds. from our first line trenches!  The turks are a few miles further on from there. As far as I can make out, we seem to be up against the stone wall of the enemy by guns which - they say - outrange anything we have produced up to now.  However I believe we attack again on Tuesday.  There is a rumour current just now that we & the 4th Bgde. are going to Shellal which the turks have reoccupied, to hold them from attacking our flank or communications.  However time will show.  I think we are in for a damned hot time wherever we go, so qu'importe?
