15 ThursdayA very fine day.  Went on route march in morning for about 3 miles, passing through very fine country. Got paid  2 in afternoon.  Went down to the village in evening.  I notice that only one furrow plough is in use here drawn by 2 horses.  There are plenty of Tommies here, especially the Army Service Corps.
16 FridayA beautiful day, weather seems to be getting on the warmer side since our arrival here.  Owing to having a very sore heal I was unable to go on parade.  Walked into Tidworth in evening & came back in a motor car.  Got some camera requisites.  Nearly everyone has a cold.
17 SaturdayInspected by Mr Andrew Fisher & party Gen. Moore this morning.  Getting very good food here (its as good as at home)We are allowed 51/2 d a day by Australian Gov. for food.  Done some printing (Photos) in afternoon.  Played cards until bed time.
18 SundayWent over to Cholderton in the morning & took a few snaps.  Went on a route march to Ludgershall (a distance of 7 miles) in afternoon & had quite an enjoyable time.
