 Up at 8 a.m. breakfast, stand to all your meals.  Wonderful what one can put up with. & what he will eat when hungry. Still rain & more mud.  Do a little fatigue & dinner & consolidate our dugout. Line up at canteen in valley for hour for bottle sauce & chocolates. [indecipherable] & mud. Transport difficulties. Tea & scrap. Camp fire & humping of logs. Song & Hymns round fire before turning in.
