  
 June 1916 5th - the Defence, Warrior & Black Prince &copy; & eight destroyers. Ten German ships known to have been sunk, & more very probably also sunk. Total of 15 believed sunk. B.C. squad. Engaged German High Seas fleet, when they attempted to break the blockade & fought it. When our Battle fleet appeared Germans imshied & evidently chased on to their own minefields as some (2) of their best boats blown up. Aust main in. Usual letters papers etc. [Note in margin:] Tuesday 6th - Busy squaring up. Wild rumours of another big naval battle. Germans supposed to have been enticed out of Elbe & rushed on to their own minefields losing 50 ships more or less. Nothing authentic. Letter from Jeannie & Bert yesty. A letter of mine recently sent thro P.O. blocked & returned. Consequences amusing. 7th - Heard that man with  fractured  shattered jaw from Bomb wound died. Inoculated again. Paratyphoid this time. Wrote Dad Mater, Molly & also a baksheesh tart in Tasmania, a Miss Henry of Ulverstone. 8th - Rumours re Kitchener being drowned, heard very early in morning & reports later in day confirmed it. Supposed he & his staff aboard cruiser "Hampshire" & she sank off Orkney Islands. Kitchener enroute to Russia. Feared all lost. Our luck seems dead out. News appeared to be incredible & men absolutely refused to believe it. Rotten end for one who had such abilities & had done so much. At present, nothing known as to what caused cruiser to sink. Nothing official yet received. Hear that B'de thought my letter amusing
