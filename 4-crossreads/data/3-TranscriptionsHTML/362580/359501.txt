<p>Heliopolis.</p>
<p>Tuesday 27th 1915. &ndash; The mail closes in the morning so am scribbling a few more lines.  Arrived here Sunday-night safely and had a pleasant journey, Dorothy, Sister Hart, &amp; I were returning to duty.  When we got into the train at Sidi Gaiber, we saw Captain McLaren, so we had company to Cairo, he was just taking a flying visit to see his beloved.  A Transport Car was waiting for us, so you see we are properly cared for &ndash; no trouble about our luggage etc.</p>
<p>We had such a hearty welcome back from a number of our friends &ndash; so pleased to see me looking well &amp; back into the Mess room once more &ndash; Also pleased to see Dorothy &ndash; We reached here just in time for 8 o'clock dinner.  Then were very glad to get to bed.  We did not have to report until 9 a.m.  Monday-morn - &amp; then I was sent to the lightest ward in the building.  Had very little to do all the morning &amp; dear Major McLean came up to see</p>
<p>[Sidi Gabier &ndash; possibly means Sidi Gaber]</p>
