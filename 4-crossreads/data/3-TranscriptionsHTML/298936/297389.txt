<p>August 1915</p>
<p>Tuesday 3</p>
<p>Two more admitted to hospital &amp; discharge of bayonet wounded men.</p>
<p>Trouble with Flint after I have reported him [indecipherable]. Apparently some of the men [indecipherable] for nice holiday &amp; get annoyed when expected to do a little work</p>
<p>What a terrible surprise is in store for them in the field and for me too I expect.</p>
<p>Often wonder whether I shall ever do this voyage on the return</p>
