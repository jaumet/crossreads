<p>Dear Mr Hughes,</p>
<p>I have your letter of 89th July. Unfortunately, Captain Arthur Gardere Ferguson, reported killed, appears to be the friend about whom you are enquiring. The records are &ndash; Arthur Gardere Ferguson, Captain in the 20th IF Batt Australian Imperial Force, killed in action 114th June 1016; buried in the Bois Grenier, the Brewery Orchard, 2 &frac14; miles South of Armentieres, by the Rev. K. Single.</p>
<p>The Bois Grenier is &ndash; or rather was &ndash; a wood just behind our front lines, and the Brewery Orchard is rather a noticeable place, where a good many gallant fellows have found a rest. I know the place well. The tops are off almost all the trees, but unless of course we lose out line there &ndash; which is a fairly remote possibility &ndash; I should imagine that the orchard will remain very much as it is at</p>
