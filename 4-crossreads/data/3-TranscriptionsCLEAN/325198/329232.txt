Harold hurt his ankle yesterday when he fell from the horse & to day it is bunged up, he is also off duty.  Every body has to parade this after noon for some reason, Cook Batmen & all.  We have our own mess orderly on now & we get on a great deal better - "Cookey" from this tent has taken it on for us.  a dry old stick he is too - The other day his old horse fell with him while cantering up into line from troop [indecipherable] formation.  I thought he was hurt but he got up all smiles & carried on.  To day ie the anniversary of the landing in Egypt of the 6 L.H.R. I wonder where we will be next 2 Feb
