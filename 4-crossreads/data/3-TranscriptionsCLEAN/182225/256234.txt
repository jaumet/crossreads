MARCH   SUNDAY 19   1916
Wrote & posted a lot of letters after tea and then we went for a walk round the beach & town for a few hours. Then we got rickshaws down to the ferry; got to boat about 10.30 pm and found she was to sail at 8 Am next day. We had a good time in Durban and had a fair reception  The men behaved them selves very well. There were no rows at all that I know of and only about half a dozen got drunk. All very sorry to leave Durban
