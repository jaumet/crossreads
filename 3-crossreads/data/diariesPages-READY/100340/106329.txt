France15/2/18
My Dear Sis Vol,I received your letter dated Oct 9th also your Xmas card. Altogether I received 28 so you can bet I have been pretty busy writing; it was the first mail I had received for over ten weeks. Laurel was an easy first with six letters a card with Auntie second with four. Am very sorry I have disappointed you about not going back to France but I have already written told you how it was I came back again. I have not been passed
