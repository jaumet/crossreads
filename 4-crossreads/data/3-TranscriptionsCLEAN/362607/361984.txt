  
 Bulford 14.10.17 Dear Mum, Just a few lines before I go the Rounds. Last Post has sounded so I've only a 1/4 of an hour to go. I went over to Lark Hill last Monday & met an old school mate, an officer. I went to Salisbury on Tuesday & walked round two of the old Villages. Pinched an apple out of one of the Orchards. My friend was very indignant. She was afraid of being run in. We have had some lovely weather again this week. To-day is glorious. I have to go away tomorrow all day on Duty. We get lots of trips to other camps to give Evidence on Court Martial. We received your Parcel last Wednesday. We were surprised to see the old canvas back again, that Ellis had sent Home with a Parcel. We have not opened the Butter yet but all the other things are Tres Bon especially the chocolates. I met Harry Hr'gre's Brother Vic the other day. I met him in Egypt also. Well, Mum I've given you all the news. We are both well. Dave & Ellis send their best Love. Best Lovey from Harry
