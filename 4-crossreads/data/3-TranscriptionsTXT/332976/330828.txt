 March 1917 29th.   Only fifteen of the section arrived yesterday, (the remainder are at  Vaylule Velu about 4  miles  Kilometres further on, and at MillerSon) &amp; seven of us went on with Cpl Moore to clean &amp; make ready for use old wells the advance party have found in Velu.   I stopped behind &amp; fixed up the cellar, &amp; also with a couple of sappers, hunted around the village, salvaging material for use by the section in our work.   The village is in a dilapidated state &amp; every house is in a mass of ruins.   Every well has been destroyed &amp; the fruit trees &amp; many ornamental trees have been cut down by the Germans. During the afternoon the Flying Corps brought up an observation baloon which is to be stationed in a paddock opposite us.
