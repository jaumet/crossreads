<p>&amp; she like a good girl took the blame on herself &amp; reckoned she was the cause of it.  It was all over my Paris experiences.  I imagined by some foolish means that she was sarcastic over it &amp; I wrote a pretty sharp letter to her in return.  The day after I posted it I was sorry but the deed was done &amp; I could only pray to Heaven that she would never get it, but no good it arrived alright &amp; today I got her letter saying how sorry she was.  I'll bet she was no more miserable over it than I, so I sat down &amp; wrote her a letter telling how sorry I was &amp; that I never ceased regretting such a rotten action &amp; I won't feel satisfied till a couple of months are up &amp; she will have it.<br/>It was announced on parade this morning that 2 of our mates have unfortunately died with the "flu" in Devonport Hospital &amp; No. 4 Coy. were detailed to attend their funeral.  I think this is a very sad thing its hard luck for the chaps but in one way worse for their people.</p>
