<p>I am lying comfortably in a deep soft bed in a charming little hospital recovering from a rather heavy attack of influenza.</p>
<p>Ever since we last came out of the quagmire trenches I have had a cold which, except at night, did not worry me at all.  On the morning of the 17th I felt too bad to go on parade so stayed in bed.  Doctor came in and I was whisked off in a motor to my present position.  I had a very wooly time for the</p>
<p>2<br/>first two days but am now well on the way to getting up.  This is the first time I have been in hospital and am feeling just a little bit guilty about it, but I am certainly going to make the most of the opportunity for a short rest.</p>
<p>A few days before coming in here I was detailed to attend a two day course of instruction in "liaison with aircraft".  In order to understand the liaison from the airman's point of view, each officer attending the course was taken up</p>
