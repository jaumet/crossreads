<p>I have not run across Jack Massie at all. He has the luck of the devil, but seems unable to make the most of it. You may remember D.M. King. Since coming to France I am told he has got a D.S.O. &amp; a M.C.  How, Heaven only knows.  But the whole question of honours is disgusting &ndash;</p>

<p>Love to all,</p>
