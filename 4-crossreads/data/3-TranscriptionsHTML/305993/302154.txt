<p>&amp; when off Imbros we passed a battleship with her main fighting top above water sunk probably the Majestic Ocean, Triumph or the Goliath.  The destroyer left &amp; shaped a course for Salonika.</p>
<p>4.1.19<br/>At 8 a.m. we passed the mine field entrance &amp; 8.30 dropped anchor at Salonika &amp; disembarked all our troops 2000 &amp; obtained news of us probably having to proceed to Batuam, Russia in the Black sea in the course of a few days.</p>
<p>5.1.18[19]<br/>H.M.T. Ormond, Malwa, Norman arrived this day from the Black sea via Constantinople.  News this day that our departure is posponed.  Had visitors aboard sisters &amp; doctors from one of the local hospitals.</p>
<p>6.1.18[19]<br/>Still at anchor awaiting orders with steam on three boilers.  Mismanagement on the Shore Government Staff.  They give us orders to be ready for a certain place, coal consumed &amp; then the next day the orders are cancelled.  It appears similar results re the other Troop transports &amp; Cargo boats, ran by the government of the dozens of transports laying here.  Thousands of pounds are wasted for the want of good organization.  The Troopships have still sand ballast in each hold which was meant to ease the damage caused by a torpedoe.  We have 1000 tons of sand ballast still aboard.  If this amount were discharged then we could carry so much cargo more &amp; similar with the other ships so therefore less cargo boats would be required.</p>
