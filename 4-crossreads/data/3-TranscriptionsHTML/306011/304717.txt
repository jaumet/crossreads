<p>Visited friends in the Strand and then went out to Kew Gardens via Hammersmith. Caught train to Euston Station which I left at 8.45 pm for Dublin via Holyhead &amp; Kingston. Arrived in Ireland's capital the following morning at 7.30. Had a good look at Sackville St. &amp; St Stephen's Green &ndash; both well known in connection with last year's riots. Visited local Scout Sec. who showed me round Trinity College, Phoenix Park &amp; the Zoo. Went for a tram ride down to Kingston. Had a walk through the streets of Dublin in the evening &ndash; plenty of light, there being no fear of zepps.
