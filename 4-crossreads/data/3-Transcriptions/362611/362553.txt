<p>thought that must <strike>inevitably</strike> necessarily precede funk. The memories of that day are very confused, more like a series of isolated pictures &ndash; first the boat with all the other boats blotted out by the Spray as the fire threw the water up all around, men jumping up and dying, myself standing in the front of the boat cursing as I never have before because the men were lying on the oars and couldn't row &ndash; then lying under  cover all except our feet &amp; legs along which a machine gun was playing &ndash; then confused pictures of bringing wounded out on the hills none knew where because we'd lost our bearings &ndash; then waiting on the beach for "the end" which 8 battleships fired continuous broadsides over our heads, - then  the cheers as the news came down of the rally and our triumphant stand.</p>
<p>There have been many scraps since, but none of them nor indeed   all of them equal those 6 hours from dawn to midday. Our old boys in the ranks have fought well, and paid their toll, and they will fight again.</p>
<p>I wish the old school success, Such as it must have if it lives up to its traditions, and I wish the boys themselves every success in facing boldly the responsibilities that will come to them early because of loss, and in filling the places of those that are gone and to go. Personally, Sir, I wish you good health and prosperity, and tender you thanks again for the care and attention whose value I did not appreciate for years after leaving the Alma Mater.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p>A.L. Buchanan</p>
