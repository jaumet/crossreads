<p>way back to the Battalion.<br/>Did I ever mention a chap called Host to you, he &amp; I were in the same company in Kensington in fact we have been together right through, he being a Sergt &amp; I Corp then we got our Commissions together, next our second stars, he was the best friend I ever had, he is the big chap in that photo of three I had sent you when I was on leave "by the way let me know if you got them alright", well the poor beggar died of wounds received at Pozieres, all my old pals are going dear, by god its cruel.<br/>My wounds are doing fine now, the Doc informs me I will be back in 6 weeks, now that isnt bad is it.
