<p>must try &amp; do some shopping.  All my boots and shoes seem to be wearing out.  This is a very hard place on shoeleather.  The weather is beautiful but warming up, hope we shall be in a cooler place for the summer.</p>
<p>The last letter was Numbered 45, so no doubt 44 will turn up next week.</p>
<p>I also got a lovely long letter from Mrs &amp; Mr Osburne.</p>
<p>One from Mollie &amp; Jess, I was quite excited at getting them.  Have only had two mails in seven weeks &amp; not one paper.  Dont be disappointed if my letters are not regular, I shall write every week, but all are censored now, so may be longer in travelling.  Have met quite a number of my old friends of last year &amp; it has been ripping to meet again, especially after the anxious time it has been for us all.</p>
<p>Fred is quite well now &amp; is working hard, there is a very busy time for all the men</p>
