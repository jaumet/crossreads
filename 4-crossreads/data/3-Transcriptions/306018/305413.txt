<p>March 1917<br/>The Turks sent up large reinforcements &amp; the 3rd LH Brigade gave them a warm time &amp; stopped them from reaching Gaza till next morning.  During the night we withdrew across the Wadi el Ghuzze as we were liable to get cut off &amp; at daylight returned to camp.  The fighting had been severe &amp; losses on both sides were considerable.  Boats landed ammunition &amp; rations on the beach &amp; it was kept up to us well.  We watered our horses &amp; had a spell all day.</p>
<p>Wednesday 28th<br/>Shifted camp near to the water &amp; it was great to get a swim &amp; a good wash again.  At night I was detailed to take charge of the Brigade camels.  It was a  bit sudden &amp; I had to take over straight away.</p>
<p>Thursday 29th<br/>Had a very busy day getting hold of the swing of things &amp; work started in earnest at once.  Each Regt got 2 leads of water  I also got some feed up from the dump on the beach.  At 12.30 the Brigade moved out  I followed with the water which I got up all right losing one</p>
