 30/10/17 reached 100,000, 700 guns.  news of German retirement to Riga district to land.  They (Germans) must have moved their forces from there for the Italian stunt.  Fleas are troublesome again.  The cook who escaped has been recaptured at Bremen. he travelled as a wounded soldier. 
 31/10/17 Beautiful night last.  Glorious day.  The German reports on the Italian stunt are rather tall I think compared with the Italian report.  Germans still retiring on Riga front. 
 1/11/17 Beautiful night last but mist has hung about all day today  We were asked to volunteer for work again which would be a benefit to us &amp; the United Kingdom after the war we would taught same.  Nothing startling to report other wise.  Germans flag flying again today.
