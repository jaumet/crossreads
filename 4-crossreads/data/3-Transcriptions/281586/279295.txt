<p>put on all night horse picket.  Up at five o'clock reveille in the morning and more fatigue all day.  So the days go by with very little variation.  Have some very happy times down at the Salt Lakes in the evening when the day's work is done. This is a beautiful spot but will not attempt a description of  it here.  That will come later.</p>
<p>Sept 2nd  Have had nearly a fortnight now at the Anzac clearing hospital in the New Zealand lines.  Very light duties.  New Zealanders much quieter than Australians.</p>
<p>Sept 16  Quite a change in the program.  After leaving Hospital spent one day in 1st ALH lines, then sent up to 3rd to work in the Dispensary Charlie and I.  We thought we were going out to Regiment.  Marched out with 24 hours rations and full kit.  The truth was a great disappointment.  Have been  here (in Dispensary) nearly a fortnight now.  Wonder what next move will be.  Have been into Ismalia several times, very quiet, but pretty down in the French quarter, and provides a welcome break to the monotony of camp life.  Went one night to the Mahommaden Mosque.  Were asked at the door to remove our boots.  First one boot off, then put that foot inside, then the other boot and ditto  Hats off next</p>
