Mon July 1st
Got a pleasant surprise this morning when I went down to the Y.M. to see my name on the Motor School List. The new school is not finished yet, so we are still carrying on at the Cinema. During the morning we had a Lecture, on the motor engine, and from 11 to 12, and about 1.45 to 4 pm we dis-sembled and assembled different parts of a motor. 
Went into Town after Tea but did not stay long. Met Perce Taylor and we went and had a feed of chips.
Finished Letter No 28 to B.E.
Tues July 2
Went into Eye Specialist again ay Weymouth, and got issued with a pair of Glasses. Attended Lecture before I went, on "Timing the Valves". I'm very glad I didn't miss it, as it is a very particular item. Stayed in Camp at night. Had Supper at Canteen ? Fish and Chips.
Wed July 3
The Lecture this morning was "Cooling and Lubrication". After that we had a good go at timing the valves, and I do believe that my dense brain has almost grasped the idea.
Stayed in Camp and did some washing. A lovely job, I don't think.
