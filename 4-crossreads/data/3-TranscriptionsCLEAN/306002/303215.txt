1.7.15safe as it could be.  3 men in a quarter of an hour is no joke.  Early this morning we were warned to go on sapping at 12 o'clock, but as we are to have signalling practise, I went to Adams & told him to take us off the sapping party, we had rather a strong argument on the subject, but I had the best of it.  After tea Stan, Les & I went to the beach for a swim & the sea was rougher than I have yet seen it & it was glorious to swim in, just as we came out 3 Turkish prisoners were marched down for a dip & to wash some of their clothing, they seemed happy enough for anything.  Murgha Mack went to the field Hospital (on the beach) this afternoon with inflamation of the bowels.  Dr. Wells has also left us with ear trouble & I hope he never returns as he treats none of the lads properly.  It is said that Standford's thigh is broken.
