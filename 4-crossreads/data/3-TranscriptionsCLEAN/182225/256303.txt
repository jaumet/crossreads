JULY   MONDAY 3   1916
A cold wind blowing all day & a shower or two of rain at night. They had a couple of practise shots with the 4.7 in the [sheen/stern?]. We had some Semaphore signalling in morning & none of us got on too well. Had some buzzer work in the afternoon.
 
Look up and not down,
Look forward & not back,
Look out & not in - and
   Lend a hand.
