  
 28.10.16 confidently asserted that we shall be in El-Arish for Xmas  The 3rd L.H Regt held sports today down on the flat, & 2 teams from the Sqdn played a drawn game of football; Col Granville came back from the School of Instruction this afternoon but is leaving again tonight on the 10 oclock train on a days trip; Major Irwin & Capt White return from School of Instruction tonight   Mergha Mack came back to the Camp again this afternoon looking well but do not expect him to last long as the drink appears to have him beat; I fancy he is only returning so he will hold his seniority he should be due for this third star shortly
