<p>Sunday 28th Nov 1915</p>
<p>Visited with snowstorm early hours of morning.  Still falling when I awoke.  Whole of the country under a mantle of white.  Fall judged to be about 4 inches.  Am frightfully sick myself, with overpowering nausea &amp; no appetite.  Absolutely unfit for duty.  My back also is worrying me.  Have been [indecipherable] to complain for last two days.  With the traffic, there was soon mud everywhere.  I have never seen such slosh &ndash; its absolutely impossible to get through it &ndash; slide, slip, &amp; slither all over the place, if you are luck enough not to get stuck in it ankle deep.</p>
<p>Monday 29th Nov 1915</p>
<p>Compelled to report sick, sent to No. 2 M R Field Amb. with jaundice.  Insufficient room there: sent from there to Casualty Clearing Station, but I refused the accommodation there &amp; went back to my bivouac.</p>
<p>Tuesday 30th Nov 1915</p>
<p>APMS has now sent me to N.Z. Field Amb.  Attention good, but food poor &amp; ill-cooked.</p>
<p>Wednesday 1st Dec 1915</p>
<p>Have been sent again to Clearing Station with lumbago &amp; jaundice.  Expect to be evacuated shortly.  Every man for himself here &ndash; with plenty of fleas, lice.  Food bad.  Biscuits again with black tea.</p>
<p>Thursday 2nd Dec 1915</p>
<p>Left the Clearing Station, thank God, this morning &amp; taken aboard S/S Oxfordshire, a three master hospital ship &ndash; excellently fitted.</p>
<p>Friday 3rd Decr 1915</p>
<p>Spent a comfortable night - first sleep for a week &ndash; left about 4 a.m. for Mudros where we arrived in due course.  Have no idea of my ultimate destination.  <strike>Had</strike> Enjoyed the luxury of a hot sea bath &amp; had my clothes thoroughly disinfected.</p>
<p>Am feeling none too bright.</p>
<p>Left Mudros about 2 o'clock for Alexandria.</p>
<p>Saturday 4th Decr 1915</p>
<p>Life on hospital ship pleasant &amp; comfortable.  Member of 17th BN died &amp; was buried at sea.  An R.C service performed by C E Chaplain.</p>
<p>Sunday 5th Decr 1915</p>
<p>Arrived Alexandria shortly after breakfast.  Disembarked about 3 o'clock &amp; boarded trains for Helipolis.  Red Cross served us with tea, bread &amp; butter, &amp; other comforts on the way across.  Arrived outside Palace Hospital Heliopolis at about 7 o'clock at night.  We were then sorted out &amp; I was taken with a number of others to Luna Park Hospital by Red Cross Motor Wagon.</p>
<p>Served with hot cocoa &amp; biscuits, &amp;</p>
