<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persuasion we got Wal to take on.  Well all went well &amp; we were going along when Wal turned round &amp; gave me his cigarette saying "Here Le, finish this one for me:  I've only had about 2 or 3 draws at it, &amp; now I'm going to "puke."<br/>Talk about laugh. Rid &amp; I nearly choked laughing at poor old Wal.<br/>Must close now, Daddy dear<br/>Trusting you are all keeping well at "Cairnleath"<br/>With much love to you &amp; Mother dear, not forgetting Ol &amp; Anna,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
