<p>3 p.m. leave Adelaide, more beastly mal-de-mer.</p>
<p>Nov;<br/>Reach Melbourne &ndash; raining &ndash; reminds me of London. 2 p.m. no lunch, entrain for Broadmeadows Camp &ndash; arrive, Broadmeadows ankle deep in mud &ndash; no lunch, no tents &ndash; everything rotten</p>
<p>Nov;<br/>Visit Melbourne Picture Gallery &ndash; rather good painting by St.George Hare, flesh very nicely handled. A powerful piece of work by Harold Power, and &ndash; a Brangwyn! No need to say what I thought of his work. Visit Dick H., a most frightful scamp but great fun, understands Art and Literature but not how to treat his wife. I meet a charming damsel, rather like one of the dream maidens that Waterhouse delights to depict; want to have a chat with her but Dick drags me off to a theatre, suppose a man with more sense would not have allowed himself to be dragged off.  Return to camp by a detour to avoid pickets.</p>
<p>Dec; - 3 a.m.<br/>March off to entrain for Williamstown &ndash; ranges firing all day &ndash; return to camp</p>
<p>Dec;<br/>Manoeuvres. These are of frequent occurrence, hence no mention hitherto.</p>
<p>Dec; Saturday<br/>Have leave  for Saturday only &ndash; visit Delafield Coote, stay the night.</p>
<p>Sunday. 11 a.m.<br/>Visit Trevor Knaggs, find he has married and has a child &ndash; like most infants of tender weeks, very ugly,</p>
