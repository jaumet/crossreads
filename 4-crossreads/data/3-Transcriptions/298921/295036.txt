<p>March 1915<br/>Thursday 4<br/>"Pow Wow" re yesterday's manouvres &amp; going Cairo for new Riding Trousers. Went Museum &amp; saw many mummies &amp; strange things impressed on my mind was a good old leg of mutton embalmed &amp; mummied 3000 years B.C.!!!!<br/>Would that I had longer to see these things, but the egotistical bombastic Australian may realize he is <u>very young</u> when seeing &amp; living in the past as we are here. Truly in the midst of life we are in death.</p>
