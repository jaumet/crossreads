<p>writers.<br/>Had a nice letter from Del a few days ago. She writes very cheerfully and says Hubby is getting on fairly well. She evidently had not heard of Peter enlisting as she did not mention it. I hope I run across the young Blighter on this side, that's all.</p>
<p>Exeter letters have been coming to hand regularly. They were having it pretty cold when last   <strike>we</strike>  I heard  (Jan 12th) &ndash; It does not seem altogether beyond the bounds of possibility that we will have a chance of getting to England yet. I suppose it all depends on how the cat jumps as regards Mackenson's march on Egypt. I am very much inclined to think the latter will fizzle out . I have yet to write Pat &amp; several other letters by this mail so please excuse</p>
