<p>(No. 9)<br/>Troopship Kyarra<br/>Fremantle<br/>14th December 1914</p>
<p>Dear old Mrs,<br/>I was very disappointed to find no letter or telegram from you &ndash; the Orontes is due here from Sydney to-morrow   I suppose your letters will be on board her -  I will probably not get them, as we expect to leave this afternoon   I am hoping that we will be delayed long enough to get the mail, if we are not it is possible that the Orontes might carry them on to Colombo &amp; we may get them there.   I have just sent some Xmas cards &amp; hope they will reach you all right.<br/>I invested in a bathgown today</p>
