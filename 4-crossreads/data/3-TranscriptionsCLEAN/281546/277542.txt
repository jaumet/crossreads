  
 Camp, but when we were passing No 3 Camp word came down the Road to return as our Quarter's were altered to No 6 Camp. After a brief spell we all returned and arrived at the Camp at about 11 Pm, where we Alphabetically were allotted our Hut's and Companie's and after handing in our Passe's we made for our respective Hut's. We are now drafted into Companies for Each State we come from. Friday 23rd  After Breakfast we paraded for a Roll Call and to go and draw our Kit Bag's which had been brought down to the Camp, also to go and be inoculated and then off duty for the day. There are 32 men in each Hut and we are not overcrowded and when we receive out Mattresses and having the Electric Light in each Hut, we will be comfortable until we leave for the Boat which we all hope will not be long. After Dinner I received strike>a  7 letters from Home and spent the Afternoon reading the news and my Papers.
