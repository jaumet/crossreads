  
 1/8/17 Campagne had a bottle of wine - quite a farm life.  Talked to Madame and she was full of trouble about the War and the inroads on her family.  A splendid field at the back she would not let us have for drill as she keeps horses calfs cows etc.  Went on to another billet now of a similar kind - old low black ceilings and men rolling in casks of beer and wine for the soldiers get paid tonight and their money will be largely used for buying these things.  The people here were not so nice  - two old things were working near spinning wheels.  The daughter was florid and flirtatious looking.  Home via the bridge - we have men in all the billets hereabouts.  Entered the grounds by a side gate and took a path which wandered round through the trees and undergrowth all dripping with the continuous rain.  The rain has continued steadily all day and must be most unfortunate for our offensive as Leon Barbier says the Germans
