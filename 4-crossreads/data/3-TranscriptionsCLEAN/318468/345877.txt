A City of great contrasts most ancent & Historical buildings such as the "sultan Hassan" Mosque the ruins of the Tower of Babel etc.    In all it has I think been a great education to most of us to have seen this part of the world & although in some respect our stay on the sandy desert has not always been too pleasant still I think there are few who regret having been here & in after years those who are spared amongst us will look back perhaps with wonder to the time when they were caught up in this great Empire affair & dumped down so suddenly in this ancient land of Egypt [indecipherable] the await the further pleasure of that great war Lord K.K. to be sent wherever he sees fit - when the time is ripe for us to take our part in the struggle & I do not think there is a man in the Force who has not complete confidence in him
