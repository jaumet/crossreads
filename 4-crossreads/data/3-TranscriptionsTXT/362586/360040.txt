 Letter contained in above envelope] H.M. Transport At Sea 19.xi. 15 Lieut Ferguson Adjutant, Camp  R.A.S. Grounds 
 Dear Mr Ferguson I desire to acknowledge your kindness in giving this Presbytry a ring to remind me of the date of embarkation etc.  I had the good fortune to remember what Capt.  [indecipherable] told me &amp; I kept in close touch with the ship's authority so everything was in order about date etc.  For your kindness to me during my stay in camp I offer grateful appreciation. Farewell! Yours faithfully [indecipherable] King
