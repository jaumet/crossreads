<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother</p>
<p>Am very fit &amp; living well. Am at present in the "Intermediate line" in a very comfortable safe dugout about 30 feet deep built for us by the nice Bosche. Rochford is left well in rear &amp; keeps up the supply of chocolate &amp; things from his end. After a few days we go into the front line. The Hd Qrs dugout there is also nice &amp; comfortable &amp; safe &amp; has an old French bed in it for the use of the C.O. &amp; I am still the C.O. I like this job very much indeed. There is a great deal of responsibility but everything goes along swimmingly. The men's rations are wonderful. They get hot stew &amp; hot tea or soup delivered to them in good quantities every night in containers worked on the "Thermos" principle &amp; in addition to these they have "Tommy Cookers" (small spirit stoves worked with solidified alcohol) issued to them when they go into the front line. Every man is also given a pair of rubber boots up to his thighs when he goes into the line. Altogether the rations equipment &amp; other arrangements are splendidly done.</p>
<p>News is good here lately &amp; I feel very optimistic about things.</p>
<p>A mail has just arrived but mine has not been sorted yet.</p>
<p>Bertie (Lucas) came to see me a couple of days ago. He looks very well &amp; seems to be getting on quite alright. I shall see more of him later because he can sometimes get a car to go into a large town &amp; I shall certainly look him up.</p>
<p>Best Love to the Judge &amp; all others.</p>
<p>Your Affectionate Son</p>
