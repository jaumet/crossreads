 Cannot write very much to-day. Have been out to Crecy, had a lovely motor trip.    Miss   The Matron   &  three sisters including myself. We managed to hire a car   &  it was a most interesting   &  enjoyable time. 
 24.9.17. Unable to finish this last night. Each evening about 8.30 p.m. A little party gather in my room   &  we have a jolly cup of tea but it means no writing done because lights out at 10 p.m., so only have time to bath   &  get to bed. It is great having a bath
