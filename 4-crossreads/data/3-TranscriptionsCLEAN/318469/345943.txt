27thStill the attack does not come.  The enemy is firing a good many shells & bombs a scattered area evidently hoping to cause a demoralising effect but not doing much damage.  Work Sap, etc. going as usual.
28thWork going on well in tunnels toward Enemys lines.  Fairly heavy Artillery fire no great damage done to our trenches.
29thNothing fresh doing today.  Usual exchange bombs, shells, bullets & other missiles.
30thSame as yesterday.
31stAbout 9 p.m. heavy fire broke out all along our line & our boys made & attack on the right.  11th Battln attacking.  They succeeded in capturing about 200 yds enemy's trenches & holding them about 50 yds in advance of our lines.  Three mines were exploded by 2nd F. Coy before attack & four failed to explode.  Casualties on our side about 10 killed & 30 wounded.  We shelled enemy position all night a monitor & a Destroyer taking part & doing good work.  Officers in Charge where attack was made say that Enemy's Artillery fire on our position was magnificent.
