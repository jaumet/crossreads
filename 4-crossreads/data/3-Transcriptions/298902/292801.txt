<p>Tuesday 10th Dec.  Had rather a rough passage down, having a sick turn in the train, with very little sleep.  Went straight to the Bonnington Hotel on arrival at 7.30 A.M. &amp; had a wash, shave etc before breakfast.  Then having a number of small commissions to perform spent the morning rushing around London.  Had lunch at a National Kitchen, a restaurant run by the Government &amp; found it splendid.  On entering one buys tickets for food required &amp; then collects same at the Counter, repairing next to a table to consume the said food.  For 1/9 I had, fish, beef potatoes &amp; cabbage, pudding, bread &amp; tea &amp; the helpings were liberal &amp; well cooked.</p>
<p>Altogether a splendid institution &amp; well patronised.  Next booked a room near Victoria Station for Wednesday night in order to be close to the train</p>
