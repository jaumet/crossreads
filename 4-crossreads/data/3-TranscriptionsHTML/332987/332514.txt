<p>[Transcriber's notes: Tennent was a New Zealander and summarises his military service on page 2. He was 35 and unmarried when he enlisted in the A.I.F. in 1916, spending virtually all of his time on the Eastern Front in France, around Ypres.  This document was typed by Tennent after the war, and is interesting, descriptive and easy to read]</p>
