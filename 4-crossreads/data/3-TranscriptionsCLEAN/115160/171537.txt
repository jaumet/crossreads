 I suppose as you receive this, you will be pretty near Christmas.  Well, this Christmas will have a happier outlook for the peoples of the Allies, if the war is not over indeed by then. 
 Being away from the rest of the crowd, I have not had any mail whatever since I've been on this stunt. Nor at the postal arrangements on this job of the best.  So I will close up for the present & will drop a few lines as soon as I can.  I hope you are in the best of nick and the warm weather much more pleasant for you.  I am well and the fiddle is in good going order.  The weather is not too cold but some more rain has made it awfully sloppy again. 
 Gee there are plenty of souvenirs about here that would be handy to some, but regulations forbid and they are left to the tender mercies of whoever comes along.  It's heartrending to see so much waste of goods, but it's all in this horrible game of war. 
 Fondest love, Mither, and to Dad Bess & Lock. 
 Your loving son 
 James
