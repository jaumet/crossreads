4 August 1918 SundayWent Church in YMCA very close & stuffy-Many rumours on this front that Germans are leaving the Turks, & that an Armistice may come out of it, this is to be seen ere you get this.  Also hear Soissons retaken by us & many prisoners-  Just learnt that the facetious telegram from Cairo was a pukkha one & a little daughter was born last Thursday Aug 1st so of course I am off tonight to the little wife poor KIDDY all by herself I think she deserves the DSO
