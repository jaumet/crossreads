<p>C/o.  D. M. S.<br/>Cairo<br/>Egypt<br/>16.7.15.</p>
<p>My dear Girls:</p>
<p>10.20 p.m.    A great surprise.   When I was going my rounds one of the men came after me and handed to me a telegram.  On opening it it was with much pleasure that I read: "Sydney: 16 6 p.m. well love: Nash"   Many thanks my dears.   It is pleasant to receive so sudden a reminder of home and of those one loves.   Again much thanks.  [A line of Xs and Os.]<br/>For Caggie, Jordie, and for Kitty. Caggie, Georgie, Kitty.</p>
<p>My crowd has been more than 500 these few days, and I have set myself the task to empty them out as fast as I can, fifty went today, about 200 will be off in various directions within few days.   General Ford rang me up some days back and asked if I could turn this into an hospital for wounded men; I replied:  You but say the word and in a few days I shall be ready to receive 200 patients, and in one week, 700 if you so desire.    Making good here will be of assistance to me in any future work that may come my way.</p>
<p>During the week letters came from Buddie and from Kitty, both had been posted in Maitland, yet none arrived from you, this has often happened before, presumably because our letters are blocked by some ass in Sydney while the men in the country towns send everything straight on.   You just find out who the galoot is then ring his neck with out giving him my compliments, I should willingly help if he were within my reach.</p>
<p>Kitty and Buddie were both good to write to me, especially the later while she was on holiday.   I have typed reply to Buddie's but not yet to Kitty's, but if not to sleepy later on some words may be filled in on sheets to express my sentiments to her.</p>
<p>Train loads of wounded are still pouring into Egypt, within day or two you will have fresh large lists of killed and injured men.   What will you all think of them.  I must look out for Victor Meeks and the Bowen man from Melbourne.   I do hope that our fellows will be able to take the hill on the Galipoli peninsula, Gaba Tepe, at the foot of which they have been blocked for so long, it would produce a favourable impression through out all the Ottoman and other Eastern powers.  I am not hopeful, and pray I that it may not come to pass as I expect.</p>
