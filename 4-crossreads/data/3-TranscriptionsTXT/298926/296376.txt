Being lent no meat is eaten at the monastery so as I did not care for macaroni stuff I was not sorry to get away.                        They gave me a letter to the Lord Bishop of London and after the service at St Pauls we went up into St Pauls vestry and were blessed. (I hope it does me some good)
9th  Being Easter Monday or what it is better known here as Bank Holiday I thought I would take a trip out to "Appy" Ampstead Eath
