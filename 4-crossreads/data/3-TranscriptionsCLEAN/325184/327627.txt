Had to climb up side by means of rope ladder. Found Nell and Chris exceedingly well and in good spirits. Tho' I had arranged rooms for them at the Hotel, regulation did not permit them coming off, so I remained on the ship all night. Met T.H. Kelly on Board for Sydney. Nell says she had a most enjoyable trip, tho' she did not avail herself of my offer to see something of South Africa.
