<p>124<br/>as at Fenquieres though as for myself I am more at home here than there for I have condescended to speak French.</p>
<p>To night I borrow a horse &amp; ride over to the Chinese Camp near Fenquieres to say good bye to friends but find most of them gone Little &amp; [blank space] are the only ones left. They invite me on to dinner &amp; after dinner I return to say good bye to Mde. Boulinger &amp; then return to join Prentice at old Battalion HQ.</p>
<p>Then we commence our ride home through the inky blackness lighted only by glow worms when road cuts deep into the earth. The sky is clouded &amp; a thick driving mist damps us through &amp; through. You cannot see 3 ft away except when the horses hoofs on the flinty stones strikes fire.</p>
<p>The road between the trees beautiful by day is as mysterious in its silence by night. Not a sound even of a cricket &amp; the tramp of the horses which seemed alien to the surroundings. Peace Perfect peace indeed it seemed but who knows what awful carnage &amp; tragedy was being carried on in natures realm.</p>
<p>Arrived back in camp about 11 pm &amp; put the horses up &amp; retired wet but pensive</p>
