<p>of the particular camel that we struck last night &ndash; he hummed very considerably.   He also jigged about so much that my pipe was knocked out of my mouth &ndash; it was the last pipe that you sent me from the Civil Service so I had to pull up &amp; make a search for it in the sand.   I am smoking it now but it is a wee bit gritty.  I have not yet broached the tin of tobacco that I sealed up on leaving Sydney &ndash; I managed to get a few pounds of decent ply tobacco on the Kyarra &amp; have been using it.  I fear I would incur your dire displeasure if you would see the number of cigarettes I smoke in the day &ndash; about six I should say &ndash; but when you are in Egypt you must do as the Egyptians do.  I hope you received the small parcel of knick knacks that I sent you.<br/>I must now end up as it is getting near lights out &amp; it is "Death" if the O.I/c. Camp has lights at the lights out.<br/>With very best love to all<br/>Yr own old man<br/>Will</p>
