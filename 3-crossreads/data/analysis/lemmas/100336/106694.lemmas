 it was a lion , but we knew that it was not like for a lion to be in that part of the countri so we did not know what to think about it . ( Two year afterward while I was work at Gelebek not mani mile from that place one of the German engin shot a larg wolf so we came to the conclus that it must have been a wolf which we came across on that night . About 3 a.m. we got off the mountain into some fair clear countri we could see a fair high hill in the distanc so we decid to make for this and spend the follow in the top of this hill about 4 a.m. we start to climb reach the top about 4.30 . We were surpris to find remain of a build here so we approach veri care . On examin it was found to be the ruin of an old Arab castl bush have grown up amongst the stone ruin . We found it quit a good hide place . When day broke we were surpris to see sever small villag round this hill , so we lay down and slept on till well on in the afternoon . Then we began to think about get water . In the distanc we could make out cattl and hors go to a certain spot remain a while , and then go away . We came to the conclus that there must be water there so we mark the posit . At dusk we made our way off the hill in the direct we expect to find the water . After half an hour walk we came to well . There was a hous about three hundr yard away , a dog bark we decid to run the risk and get water from the well . It turn out to be good water and nobodi had seen us . Short after this we were cross a field and came on a patch of water melon . They were not quit ripe but that did not matter . We sat down and ate one a piec and carri a coupl with us . We soon got into rough countri again . About midnight we came to a sheer precipic . We could not see ani mean of climb down as it was a sheer cliff about 300 feet . We sat down and listen , away down below we could hear the faint sound of run water . We soon came on the conclus that this must be the Tarsus river which we had to cross so we decid to follow the cours of the river down until we came to a place where we could climb down to cross . So we set off it was not long befor we came to a clear piec of ground so we made our way toward this . We intend ask for water as we had run out . When we got close to the build we call out " su" in Turkish for water but got no repli , so we call out again . This time an old man stood up on the roof . He had been sleep there as it was veri warm weather , so we call out again but he would not answer us , so we thought he may take us for robber and give us a bullet , so we decid to get away while we were safe . We got up in amongst the bush and rock and after travel a littl way we decid to lay down and sleep till daylight . At daylight we got under way again . We had not gone far befor we sight a small villag right ahead of us so we made our way toward the river . Again our luck was in for there was a water-way lead down to the river . On examin we found that by care manouv we would be abl to get down .
