  
 Wed 30th Jan 18 Allotted to NH Platoon 14 Section & had to march about 4 miles on to where they are camped at St Eloi or rather where St Eloy has been as it is hard to find a compliete brick let alone a piece of wall standing Thompson & Bill  in this platoon. We have been together right through &they are both good mates An  other  old hand - Proso - is with us have spent the afternoon making a "dugout" with buiscuit tins full of dirt & bow iron pinched from a R E dump close by. It will be quite the "Home" when finished room for 2 bunks on each side & about 2 ft of space down the centre & just high enough to stand upright The country is all shell holes full of water old trenches wire & all kinds of rubbish. About 100 yds away on the crest of a ridge are some imense mine craters fully 30 to 40 ft deep. There are a great many guns about that do a lot of fireing but so far no shell have come near us They say we are 3,000 yds from the front line
