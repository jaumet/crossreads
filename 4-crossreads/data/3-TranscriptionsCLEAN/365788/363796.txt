  
 senior to me as Lance Corporal & there was no hope of another stripe I decided not to accept it. Two others were also given one stripe & only one accepted the stripe. Perhaps it is just as well that I did not accept as it would have very likely stopped me going. Very much love dear old girl please tell [indecipherable] I have gone & give her my love Ever your loving brother Fred
