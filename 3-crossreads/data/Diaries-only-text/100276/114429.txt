the cooks use it to thicken the stews it makes a bonzer meal.
We are going into the trenches tonight "supports" I think, Len took 3 men up last night to act as guides There are some water hens on a small lake quite close to us now again the boys pot one with the rifle. 
Last night they caught a German sniper out between the trenches a couple of Germans gave themselves up, full to the neck of it.
The Huns have been searching all day long for one of our batteries which is quite close to us, but they have done no damage.
To-day has been a bonzer nice sunny I hope it holds fine for our stay in the trenches
