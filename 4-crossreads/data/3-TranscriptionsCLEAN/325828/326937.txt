One can't help noticing the extra long days or at least extra long time of daylight here One  day  morning last week I was awakened from my slumbers by a mobile A.A (ant-aircraft) gun outside doing some barking & on looking at the time was surprised to see it hardly 1/2 past 3 although it was perfectly light & I am not sure that the sun was coming up to see what the row was about
