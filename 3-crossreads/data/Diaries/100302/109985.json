Across fields of shooting corn peas &amp;c and sat down for a while watching our antiaircft gun potting at a Taube. A big gun was firing very heavy long range shells well over.

The number of details of our Coy. are extraordinary. With sigs, scouts, m.guns, bombers, cooks, sick orderlies, guard &amp;c out of 221 men only 136 are available for parade. All wear steel helmets at work all day and the weight on the head is considerable. Wearing one continuously for 8 hours today has given me a pain in the neck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quality of the draughthorses and the cows we see here is excellent. The cattle are hand fed in stalls and well groomed. In a field today saw men threshing wheat with heavy wooden flails worked dexterously by a turn of the wrist. Also saw two large hares running along lush green grass and trees here. One throws oneself down on a sward of grass 4 to 5 inches high scattered thick with buttercups and other wild flowers some of which we cultivate in our gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>English, Australian mail to hand today. The only biscuits obtainable here are Petit Beure and cake is a rare commodity in La France. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>New scheme for work tomorrow doing it by half companies 7-1, 8pm-2am.
