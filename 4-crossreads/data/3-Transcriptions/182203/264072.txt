<p>hospital ship came, to take patients from there to England &ndash; They had to Staff the boat. Glad I was not one chosen to stay there. Want to get to England as soon as possible.<br/>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all, shall write again before we land. Am very well &amp; feel much better for the rest. We are not working on board. Hope you are all well.<br/>From,                                                                                                                                                            Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                Edith</p>
