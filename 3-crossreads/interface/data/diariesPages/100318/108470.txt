Villers-Bretonneux
dumps of 18 pounder shells and there are dumps right up to the present front line almost. Got back and commenced to make preliminary arrangements for the relief. We go into the line on X-Y night and the 21st hop over on a defensive flank job. Remained down in the stuffy dugout until very late and then went around the line of the supports and saw my chaps. Keith Sutherland had come up and came around with me. Saw Col. Brazenor and then visited D C Coys. The Hun was firing green flares and putting a few shells over. Guns are being put in close behind us now. Received word that wireless points to the Hun using gas tonight. Much transport in Villers Bretonneux.
