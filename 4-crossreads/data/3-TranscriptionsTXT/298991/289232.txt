Friday Oct 26th Cont.
It was rather poor. After we had supper at the Alexander Cafe & then motored back to our ship. It is absolutely the best days outing I have spent for a very long while, thanks to Mrs Morton, Miss Stevenson & another girl friend. We were very sleepy & tired upon arrival back at the boat. The Gardens in Capetown are lovely. Wages are very good here. Things are rather dear. No food restrictions through the war.
Saturday Oct 27thSailed at 7 am this morning, I am very sorry our stay in Capetown was so short. A week could have easily been spent there without seeing the same thing twice. It is still windy & rather cold. As planned yesterday, if we were to sail today, the girls waved a goodbye on the heliograph. There was rather a heavy swell on this afternoon. I was sea-sick after tea.
Sunday Oct 28thFeeling sick today. Very quite.
