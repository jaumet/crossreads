Prussian Guards, so a Colonel told me
They were being marched down the road in line with an armed Australian at front and another in the rear.  Most of these men had given themselves up as soon as their position had become dangerous and they were all rather willing to be prisoners
They had had enough, their uniform is grey with red pipings, and, to my mind, quite a botch in style and cut, lacking the manly soldierly appearance of ours.  The German face seems to be blank of that indescribable something which is priceless beyond intellect. Which requires that bread be eaten in two Kingdoms.  It is curious to note how materialistic mental qualities have flattened his face as though he has for generations been looking through the close pressed pane of worldly fact, rather than through the open windows of heaven.  There is a distinct loss and flattening at the back of the head towards the crown.  In no single case have I seen in the German that depth and beauty of eye which tells of fancy and dream qualities - of the higher imagination
