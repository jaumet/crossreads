<p>14 December Tuesday 1915<br/>Fortunately the weather is remaining fairly fine. We are in the hands of the Almighty for the next [indecipherable] of it. Keeps calm all will be well. Abdul has given us his worst number of [indecipherable] and Bombs. But a surprise is in store for him. Our next Dugout is not so roomy as the last. I have Lieut Harris in with me. A little more vermin I think also but the cold settles these friends &ndash; Fancy a warm bath clean sheets again!!!   Got a rotten cold. Turks let go 7 pigeons today &ndash; news for Constantinople no doubt.</p>
