  
 Peace Day March 
 Saturday 19 July 1919 Went to London Bridge to meet the train from Brighton at 8.19 but that train wasn't running so went to Victoria & met the 9.15. Poor Janet had to wait an hour at the Brighton end. We went into the Street & got a fair position for the procession. Gee it was some crowd & they went absolutely mad when Foch, Beatty and Haig went by. We saw the whole lot & had a very decent view. Saw all the big heads. After the procession we walked to Sloan Sq. & had something to eat. A huge queue waited for tickets for the railway at the station. We wandered around & finally got the 3.40 pm to Brighton. Got my room OK & then had tea & a walk. Brighton was mad too. They had a procession etc. dancing on the esplanade & a bonny display of fireworks. They were the best I've ever seen. Gee it was magnificent. It rained just before the display too. It finished at 11.15 pm. Took Janet home after being in a rush for a train & then came back to bed. Gee I'm some tired. 
 Sunday 20 July 1919 [5th after Trinity] Bed goodo.  Had brekker there. Went outside at 11.45 am & and then got a bus to Rottingdean. Not much of a place. It had rained some during the night. Quite fresh outside. Met Janet a 4.15 & we went & had tea & then got a train to Dyke Road & from there got a bus to the Dyke. Came straight back & went for a walk. Took Janet home at 10.30 pm & then went back to the hotel. Parlied avec a french madamoiselle who couldn't speak english & then went up to bed.
