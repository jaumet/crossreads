<p>for King or country<br/>As night fell the sea got worse also the sickness I faced going below about 7 PM &amp; managed to swing a hammock &amp; hop into it. It proved more comfortable than it looked &amp; I slepped without a break untill 6 in the morning.</p>
<p>We sleep &amp; eat in the same place &amp; it is very stuffy in rough weather when the port holes are closed. Otherwise things are good</p>
<p>Sunday 17/6/17<br/>Had an excellent nights sleep in spite of unusual conditions The ship was not steady</p>
