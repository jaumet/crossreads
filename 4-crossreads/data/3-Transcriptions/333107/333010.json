<p>Friday Mar 1st</p>
<p>This morning I changed Jobs with Bill Beard.</p>
<p>A new chap was put on today and he took my old job. I assisted Bob, as his mate had gone away on Leave.</p>
<p>Flanagan cut his thumb rather Badly, and I fixed it up for him.</p>
<p>Got a letter from Cis, with a Photo of Kath enclosed. Kath is a fine big Girl, and it makes me begin to feel old to think I have a "full grown" niece. Got a Letter from Eric Herford today which he wrote on Dec 21st. It has been a jolly long time in coming but "better late than never".</p>
<p>Sat. 2<br/>Cold day. Drizzling with rain, during the day it made several attempts to snow.</p>
<p>After Lunch had a good hot Bath, donned a clean change and washed my dirty cloths.</p>
<p>Sun. 3<br/>Miserable weather. Made a good Fire in the Mess dining room and wrote to Cis and Eric Herford.</p>
<p>There is very little to do in this Camp and one hardly knows how to pass away the time.</p>
