<p>There was plenty of fatigue work making dugouts, bringing stores, etc., and the water was obtained from tanks a little distance down the hill.  It was brought from the neighbouring islands in lighters, and discharged into tanks at Anzac, then pumped to the tanks at the foot of Walkers Ridge.  Mules carried it up the hill to our tanks, then we carried it in kerosene tins to the cookhouse.  A quart a day was issued to every man for a few weeks, also a pint and a half of tea.
