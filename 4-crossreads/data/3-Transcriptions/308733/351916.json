<p>Very stiff luck you catching that cyclone, when it was so narrow too. Hope you have no difficulty getting someone to fix things up for you again. It would be nice for you to get a man to make a complete overhauling of the fences gates etc., and would mean a big saving in time and worry to you.</p>
<p>That Upperby shed roof was fated to go off. Have had letters from Aunt Mary in which she said she had heard we might go to France, must write this mail and give her a slight shock. Up to now there has been no mention of Australians in France in English papers which we get only two days old.</p>
<p>Heard a few bullets whistle last night, quite like old times, the remarks and comments of the new hands on the few shells they have seen burst are rather funny. We have a chap named Symons from Riverstone with us, he knows old Pa Davis quite well, a good man too.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope Nell is wrong about Bert, it would be rotten for his people.</p>
<p>Am enclosing a cheque on the account of Sgt Major Cameron of my Company made in your favour, hope you get it safely, do what you think fit with it.</p>
<p>With best love from<br/>R Mackenzie</p>
