<p>line noticed a Hun aeroplane at a tremendous height coming to attack this daring Allied Airman, to whom they instinctively yelled to "Look out" for the "devil" above! but although apparently only a few hundred yards away he could not, or was too intent on his delightful "sport" of Machine gunning the Huns in their lines, to hear the excited notes of warning called to him from his own trench.</p>
<p>Before the Allied man had the least idea of danger from above the Hun Machine, having by this time arrived very nearly dead over head, he shut off his engine &amp; thus silently made a nose dive straight at the Allied man, to all intents &amp; purposes just like a huge hawk would with almost lightning speed pounce down upon a sparrow. Not being aware till the enemy was almost on top of him he swerved but seemed to be just deluged with Machine Gun fire</p>
<p>After turning once or twice as if to "spar for position" the Allied man started a long volplane [Transcriber's note: glide] for his own line. He had evidently "got a severe doing" &amp; opinions were expressed that both his engine &amp; Gun were out of action The Hun eagerly pursued him following closely every movement at the same time keeping up a continuous "patter" of Machine Gun bullets to try and "Crash him"</p>
<p>However even in this terrible dilemma, the Allied man although hopelessly crippled appeared to make every movement in an exasperatingly cool manner &amp; at last succeeded in getting close enough to the line to enable the gunners there to "open up" on his pursuer who at once turned tail &amp; fled hastily as if for bare life.</p>
<p>Anxious inquiries were kept going till at last in a day or two word came back that the Airman had succeeded in making a successful landing</p>
