 Tue 2nd Mounted parade & were out all day on the desert & had a few glorious gallops, we arrived back in camp at 3.30 & wanted to go to Heliopolis, but had to stay in for lamp practice;  we paraded at 6.30 PM & were told that they were going to have lamp practice to-morrow night instead; so I guess I will not have a chance of getting in this week.  I intend to kick against going out tomorrow night
