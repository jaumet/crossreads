Tuesday 14-11-16Big stunt on last night our Boys (A. Co, Pioneers) went out at 6.0 A.M. in Battle order but returned  in about 11/2 hours to go out at about 2 or 3 AM.  We have Brigade of Gaurds camped alongside us Coldstreams Scots & Irish.  They are reported  to have captured 2300 Germans early this morning.  They only arrived here two days ago (the Scots).  A heavy Bombardment opened this morning at 6.50 & is still going on.  About 11.0 A.M. some of the Boys who have been wounded early are drifting in.  There seems to have been heavy casualties.  The casualties in A Company amounted to 56. 15 Killed 5 missing 17 Sev. Wounded & 18 Wounded. Louden was very much exalted as were some of the N.C.Os.  A. Co. was the only one of the Engineers
