Monday 28 May 1917.
The hottest day so far.
Physical jerks in morning.
Saw hundreds of flying fish this morning. 9 to 15 ins. long & wings varying according to size of fish. Wings are really large fins & are transparent. Frightened by boat they (fish) rise 3 or 4 feet above water and fly away from boat for a distance of from 20 to 75 or 100 yds. when they are no sooner in one wave & out into the crest of the next.
"Mock trial" (for bigamy) on the upper deck from 3 pm to 5 pm. 
Wrote letter this afternoon & missed the trial.
Sleeping on deck tonight in deck space allotted to A.C.B.F.A.
