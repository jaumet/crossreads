<p>This evening I saw a letter with Captain Storey, son to David Storey, member of the Legislative Assembly for Randwick, he told me that it had been delivered to him during the evening.  I therefore look forward to tomorrow with the thought that an Australian mail having arrived there may be letters for me.  Oremus! [Let us pray]</p>
<p>I have been nearly quite well today.</p>
<p>For Friday evening next I am bidden to dine with a doctor Adam Scheuber, a Russian, who practices in Cairo.  He has a chalet close by Mena House, there I visit and talk with him.  He is an interesting personality, midst his books and collection it may be that my evening will be enjoyable, he is a stamp collector, directing his energies in this regard mainly to those issued by the Countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, he has filled nine volumes, which I am to see on Friday.  More anon about him &amp; his place.  It has been told to me that his appetite is large.  If so then he will have a poor competition in me.  Mine is sufficient for my necessities, but it is small when compared with the men who are seated at our table at each meal.</p>
<p>His automobile is to be here at 7 p.m., which is to my mind very decent &amp; considerate.</p>
<p>5.30 p.m.  No letters have yet come to me, they have been dribbling into the house all the afternoon, my expectations have run high at times.</p>
<p>There is so much talk of our moving at an early date, that I have used up all day, endeavouring to complete some articles that have been in the making for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I posted to you some post cards and views of these parts that you may like.</p>
<p>A short letter was run off &amp; posted to Sir J. Carruthers.</p>
<p>There is Mother M. Joseph on the sand beyond walking with stately stride, clothed in a cream coloured gown &amp; black robe.  An Egyptian dressed a-la-mode oft reminds one of a member of the Dominican Sisterhood.</p>
<p>1-30 a.m., 25-2-15. No letter reached me.  A copy of "Table Talk", a Melbourne publication came, from whom,</p>
<p>[Sir Joseph Hector McNeil Carruthers (1856-1932), landowner, federationist and free-trade politician, solicitor and businessman.]</p>
