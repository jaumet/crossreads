lady friend waiting to see me off.The train arrived at Pisa during the night and I missed seeing the leaning tower.  At 9 a.m. we steamed into Genoa (Genova) - two hours late.  Here I had to change & found that there would be no train until 6 p.m. leaving me the best part of a day to look round this French Italian port.  The morning I devoted to a trip out to the famous cemetery - Campo Santo - with its beautiful statuary in marble and bronze, long galleries and imposing monuments;  the most celebrated burial ground in the world.  At dinner in a smart restaurant in via Venti Septembre I chummed up with a French Naval officer on his way to Toulon from the Adriatic.  We went for a stroll down to the docks and around the town which is busy, prosperous and clean.
