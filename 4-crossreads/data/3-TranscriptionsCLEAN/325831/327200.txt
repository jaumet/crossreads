 4. specimen they must be. Not having seen an Australian paper for some months, I can't give you my learned opinion upon the causes, nor yet the best plan of action which should have been adopted for an early settlement. I only know that for a short period kerosene & candles burned merrily. 
 Your letters were addressed c/o Commercial Banking Co of Sydney, & this seems to be rather a good plan as I can keep them posted with any changes in my address. 
 Miss Miles tells me that she will shortly be sailing for Australia, so we will not be able to avail ourselves of her kindness much longer. 
 Our cables seem to be going astray, as I have answered all that I have received from you, & sent one per week. Your last arrived yesterday. 
 Loving greetings all well. 
 Give my love to them all. 
 Your loving son 
 Keith.
