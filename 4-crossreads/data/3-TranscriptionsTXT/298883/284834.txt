12thWe had our Sports Meeting this morning at 10 A.M. Major Trickey presiding.  I was appointed executive for the Committee.
13thWe commenced training though not for the Sports at which many of the men were very much disappointed.  I spent all the afternoon making a football ground, clearing it of rubbish and filling in shell holes.
Lieut. Albert Smith our Transport Officer has just received word that his pass has come through for Australia.  He is highly delighted.  He came away in the 2nd Bn. the same time as myself on 18th October 1914 and has a wife and family in Aust.
