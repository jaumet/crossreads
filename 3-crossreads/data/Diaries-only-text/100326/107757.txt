15/9/15 while fixing a sandbag. One bullet probably a ricochet took half his face off. Buried about an hour afterwards. Abdul very jumpy last night and pouring lead into us and generally jerking ironmongery into the landscape. Tried funny business during morning waving flag and so on to which we replied in kind. Lower down one "Jim Bourke" put his head right up and made some funny remarks to which one of our lads responded. Some tried a shot at him to which he responded by signall ing a "washout" by waving his shovel from side to side. Taube aeroplane over head this afternoon which dropped a lovely bomb on Walkers ridge and left quite a big gap in the hillside. Artillery firing at it but she escaped unhurt. The bursting shells with beautiful filmy white cloud in bright sun to be seen alround her. Remarkable how the result of her observations are communicated so soon to enemy artillery. Mail arrived this evening. Daring bomb thrower in 23rd doing great work but to get in good shots raised head shoulders above pit. Abdul laid in wait for him with machine gun and the stream of bullets cut the top off his head like the top of an eggshell. The more one sees of this place the greater seems the deeds the Australians have done in these parts. Beachy Bill Rickety Kate busy today. Censoring letters by slush lamp until 1930 and so to bed.
