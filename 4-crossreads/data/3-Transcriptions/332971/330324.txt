<p>My conscience ought to be pricking me for not doing War Work or picking moss, and selfishly coming out here to enjoy this and write to you.  Yet I do want to throw off this wretched cold that still lingers on so feel somewhat justified to bathe in the Sun.  Yesterday I did too only at Kew Gardens.  The display of orchids there are too beautiful for words.  Before me now as I write, The ground is pegged out in small squares &amp; There are women old men &amp; children digging the soil where ever you go out of London you see the ground, being tilled &amp; planted by them I suppose chiefly with potatoes.  The food Controller is doing his best to prevent a bread famine ere the next harvest is ready &amp; I think almost everyone is conscientiously doing their bit to help.  It hasn't involved any great sacrifice from us.  Though Sometimes I could eat more than my portion of bread and Sugar &amp; I do enjoy the little potato allowed us twice a week.  It seems strange to have all you eat weighted out before its given to you.  We are allowed six Os of bread a day, 2 ozs of Sugar, 5 ozs of Meat for 5 days in the week.  Beans rice, fish and eggs are being used a great deal and are very good substitutes.  Fruit I miss most of all, it is so frightfully dear, though I do indulge sometimes.  I don't enjoy it as much as I might for thinking of the money it costs.  To give you an idea &ndash; Strawberries at 8/6 a lb.</p>
