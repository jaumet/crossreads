  
 War Diary 1915  30th Nov. and a Court of Inquiry (Lt. Col. Nicholas of 10th LH) President to try and get at the bottom of it - This is the first breach of discipline since the Brigade came to Anzac - The Provost Sergt. (Lutze) who was set to work [look] into the case is also in arrest awaiting trial for drunkenness on Active Service - Diarrhoea and dysentry have disappeared with the cold snap and death of flies - Frost bite must be guarded against and special precautions and instructions are being issued - greasing of the feet is the best remedy - 
 All quiet at Helles and altogether it looks as if we had to wait here until other forces in other Zones settled matters. Col. Antill is now the only officer of the Brigade who has remained throughout, without going sick, or going away, and there are not more than some 130 men of 1900 landed who have seen it out - Our 3rd L.H.F.A. ordered to Mudros to-day - by Army Corps -
