<p>Gunderson &amp; gave him a few stores. It was late &amp; a cool trip to the Beach</p>
<p>Thursday Dec 2nd<br/>I was busy fixing up matters in connection with the stores &amp; word came through that we could send over a representative to Imbros again. This we decided to do &amp; I was chosen to go over &amp; represent Divisional Artillery. Things were very hurriedly arranged &amp; I had to pack up &amp; get a little dinner &amp; hurry to get the Steamer. I saw several sad sights on my way. There were a number of poor Gurkas &amp; others who had been frost bitten on their feet &amp; could not walk. They had to be carried on to the Pier for transference</p>
