Private [Carnegie?]
The same remarks apply to this man and also to
Privates Tingle &amp; Brown &amp; Kirkpatrick &amp; Cruikshank.
In my opinion, it would be hard to find steadier &amp; more reliable men in the whole battalion.
Private Martin
This is another good man. Has had Imperial service, &amp; passed some military examinations. His control is good.
