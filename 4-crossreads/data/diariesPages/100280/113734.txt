surprised than myself when they told us we were there; our trench they called it? why it was no more than 20 yds long about up to your waist; it seemed so funny after scrapping fighting so long in good trenches. My platoon took over three of these little outposts with a gap of 60 yds between 200 between platoons settled down for the night, we relieved the 59th Bn. when I came to look at our position I did not like the look of things at all for it would not be a very hard job
