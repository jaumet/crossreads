  
 Tuesday 15 February, 1916 
 Wet day, the first for about a week. It was not enough to keep us off parade so we stripped the gun in the tent. 
 Dinner was painful today, no tea & no water. Dry bread & jam isn't a sumptuous repast whichever way you look at it, but its all in the game & you're got to keep smiling.
