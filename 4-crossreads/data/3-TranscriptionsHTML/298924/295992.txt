<p>Friday 10 January 1919<br/>Field Gen. Court Martial continued today.  I hate being President of these things but it has to be 'did'.<br/>Strong rumours we sail in a month, I hope so, also hear a mail is in from Australia but no letters yet.<br/>Mrs. Chisholm's Soldiers home has arrived from Kantara so it does not look as tho' we were going there.  I still think we may be on board a Boat in a month's time.<br/>Dolly &amp; the Babe are both well &amp; happy but no leave is granted to any Anzac Officer owing to the Bedouin affair.</p>
