  
 When we were at first out in the open ground, the Germans had their suspicions that we were there, and they kept constantly sniping and using their machine guns at random, in the hope that they would clear us away. When we had dug enough earth to shield our heads from Bullets we felt a sense of comfort and worked steadily, but if our heads peeped over the mound of earth we had already made and the German flarelights were up in the sky, they would have a few rounds at us. We had to work silently and talk in very low whispers as we were close enough to hear the Germans talking at their posts at times. We got the trench dug and had to wait until the engineers' Officer crept along and inspected it. 
 In the meantime the Germans must have felt that there was a number of us in this newly dug trench, and consequently they directed their artillery on us and made things too warm to bear; so we received orders to get out as best we could and as quickly as possible. In this confusion I was with a party of four who were cut off from the main crowd. We made a dash back into our own front line and were fired at and challenged by our own sentries, who immediately ceased firing when we cried out that we were "D" Coy. 21st. 
 We got into the trench safely, and enquired from our men which direction we should take to get back to our camp.

We were best part of two hours battling through this mud, when we were relieved to find a party of Scotchmen excavating a dugout at the bottom of which they had a roaring coal fire. With the Scotties' permission we went down the stairs of the dug out to the fire, and stood in our wet clothes until we were dry; and after this I lay down on the foot of the stairway and went to sleep. Just as it was breaking day I was roused up from my sleep by one of the Scotchmen, and he directed me to the nearest and best duckboard road to take out. On reaching the duckboard track, I could see in the distance, in front and behind me, chaps that were with us the night before; before we were split up in the confusion. I
