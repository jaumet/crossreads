Speaking of the different attacks &amp; how they fared, how far they reached etc he stated that some men did actually go far enough to see the Narrows on the first day.  The fighting on August 8th cost us dear.  In one place no less than 1000 bodies were lying where they fell, a part of Kitcheners army which went astray through some reason &amp; reached their objective after unheard of difficulty only to find the enemy ready &amp; able to outflank them.  The Turks tho. Suffered more heavily than we.  In one of many Turkish Cemeteries he counted no less than 3000 graves &amp; in one gully, in which our guns caught them assembling for an attack, lay even a larger array of bodies than the 1000 mentioned above.  The trenches were practically as they were left except where we had blown them up &amp; the Turks had removed the timber for other purposes &amp; an interesting part of the lecture was his description of the trench system of the enemy etc, ours &amp;</p>
