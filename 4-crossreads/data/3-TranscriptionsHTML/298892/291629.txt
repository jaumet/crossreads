It is a wonderful piece of work and the interior is beautifully ornamented.<br/>Last Monday we had to turn out to a Divisional Inspection. The Division had to be complete in every particular including transport, Field Artillery, and Field Ambulance, and each man fully equiped carrying his kit packed for the front.
