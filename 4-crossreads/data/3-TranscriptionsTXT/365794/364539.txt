 Friday 18 [17] May 19017 [1918] S. Cambridge discharged.  A beautiful exhibition of flying 9 a.m. seen from roof.  Plane revolves slowly down as though coming on top of us then flies just over our heads &amp; skims away seawards. Later anti-aircraft guns are heard practising only. Today the "Omrah" late P &amp; O to Aust. is torpedoed only a few miles out.  All hands saved but everything lost.  Took 4 hrs. to go down. 7.50 p.m. asked M.O.'s permission to go out [indecipherable].  Absolutely refused, "Colonel will not allow it sister, must wait". Anger on part of Aust. but of course only smiled &ndash; (outwardly).
