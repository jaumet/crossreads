<p>3.4.16<br/>Mon 3rd<br/>5 oclock reveille this morning &amp; is to be from now on;  The troops do one hours musketry every morning before breakfast, &amp; a route march this morning after breakfast;  It seems unnecessary to give them so much work when they have been so long in the Army &amp; the days are too hot for comfort when doing no work.<br/>Baxter took sick a couple of days ago &amp; has pulled out of the Sigs, I give them work daily</p>
