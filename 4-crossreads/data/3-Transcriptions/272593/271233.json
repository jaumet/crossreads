<p>After coming back we had to set to &amp; clean all the mud off our dirty clothes and equipment &amp; we also got our packs which enabled us to shave &amp; kid "we did not want it   then in the afternoon we had a short parade more for inspection than for anything else.<br/>I am still feeling far from well &amp; passed a most restless night. Brigade has just issued an order that we are to have 2 days rest  but I'll bet we get very little peace what with one thing &amp; another<br/>While here  we are running a "Sergts Mess" so we will fare very well for food &amp; it will be very convenient   Heavy bombardment all along the front we can hear quite plain from here the rumble of the "heavies"<br/>I wonder what it means</p>
