<p>My dear Arthur,<br/>I has just learned of the loss of both your dear boys &amp; am grieved for you and your dear wife. Sympathy in such a loss is at best very barren but I would like to be permitted to say that the cause in which their lives were sacrificed was a noble &amp; worthy one &ndash; In youth you were <u>never</u> daunted &amp; opposition or apparent failure only spurred you on &ndash; May the old determination still remain with you and enable you to bear with fortitude your dreadful loss and comfort &amp; cheer your wife whose excellent brother also paid the penalty.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>[indecipherable] Edward</p>
