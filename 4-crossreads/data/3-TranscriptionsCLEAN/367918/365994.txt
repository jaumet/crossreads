 I have just read an interesting article on the Light Horse in the Sydney Sun of Mar 16th - probably you have seen it. It purports to be by Keith Murdoch but is to my mind very obviously Gulletts production. I should say he either wrote the major part of it or supplied the data for Murdoch. It certainly reads very much like Gulletts work. A lot of truth in it even though it does sound such a grouse 
 I am still struggling with War Records - getting near the finish of it now I think. Fortunately I am only collecting the material. The person who does the classification and writing up of it all is not due for demobilisation for years yet. I am in some hopes now of getting away to England fairly soon. 
 I hear that all who are intending to do post graduate work are to be in England before the end of June so I must get away soon or I'll be missing it altogether. That the latter should happen is not impossible. A pessimist would say it would only add emphasis to the "Forlorn, forgotten" note of Murdoch's article. At any rate I am not worrying - I dont seem to care very much
