 April, 1915 Saturday 3 Easy day today, but off duty with Tonsilitis. I am anxious to know if you have received any of this Diary, no acknowledgement so far &amp; I would not post if I thought never to reach you. My French is improving &amp; I can manage the garcons &amp; waiters easily now. Am enclosing Charles letter from Ypres.
