<p>Monday 23 April</p>
<p>Fine Day.<br/>Incinerator.<br/>"Anzac Coves" concert in Albert after tea.  I was particularly impressed by one item &ndash; a song sung by a chap in evening dress.  He was singing and pretending to be writing the subject of the song in letter form.<br/>"The Mountains of Mourn".</p>
