Saturday 13 April
Now just out of Hazebrouck where we detrain after coming up via Doullens, St. Pol Lillers. Things up here are very confused rumours are current as to the extent of the advance. Some say the fighting is now round Merris Strazeele. We are forming an A.D.S. immediately. All along the railway line are signs of recent bombing by the Germans. The A.D.S. is at Borre on Hazebrouck-Ballieul Road the Australians dug in on the Strazeele heights immediately after marching off the train. The Guards 29th Division are here, the men of the latter being very drunk disorderly.
Sunday 14 April
A rotten North wind to-day. No news from the line. Still near St. Sylvestre Cappel, 4 or 5 kilos from Hazebrouck. Everywhere you see troops who have been lost at the 1st A.C.C.S., things were left in an awful hurry. Line seems to be Nieppe Forest Estaires-Merris-Steenwerke, Ballieul being still in our hands. French troops are in the vicinity.
The vicinity still throngs with refugees, poor beggars, young old, living in tents under tarpaulins anywhere along the road.
