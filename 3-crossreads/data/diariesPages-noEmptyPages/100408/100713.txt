St saw Mr Dick Holsom. He told me Claire Holsom only went back from leave on Monday that Billy Holsom was passed. He would have taken me out to his place only he has just had an addition to the family. After leaving PB Cos went back to Tottenham Ct Rd. by Bus, had tea at a restaurant went per tube via the bank to Clapham Common to see Uncle Charlie. He was out when I arrived at his place so after waiting about  hr I left again, after leaving some souvenirs for him to mind. I arrived back about  past 9 feeling very tired. On way from Dover by train had a fine view
