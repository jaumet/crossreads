  
 14th April A German airoplane which was doing stunts around the camp, came a cropper just alongside the fence of the camp amidst loud cheers from the prisoners. This afternoon gave a lecture on the cruise of the "Wolf", in the Caserne Dining Hall. 16th April Weather cold & wet again, this is sure a godforsaken climate to live in. 20th April All Merchant Service officers were notified to be ready to leave the camp at 4 p.m. for Fuchsberg. So we hustled to pack & I had time to notify Sydney office by P.C. before leaving. Beyond knowing that Fuchberg is somewhere in the State of Hanover, nobody knows anything about it. 4.20 We marched out of camp for the station & left Heidelberg Station at 510 pm 930pm Arrived at Frankfurt & were marched out of the station to a Red Cross Hut, opposite the Carlton Hotel & then we had a jolly good supper, macaroni, Hamburg steak & potatoes, a waiter in  evening dress  in attendance so it evidently came over from the Carlton.
