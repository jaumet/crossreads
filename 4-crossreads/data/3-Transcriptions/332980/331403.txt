Officer, each man received some Bread, Butter &amp;amp Cold Meat, also Tea &amp; away to the Tables &amp; soon were busy having Tea. Afterwards we were allowed to wander about the Camp which had a High Barbed Wire Fence around so as we could not wander out &amp; into the Town.   At 6 Pm a Concert was held in a large room by the Camp Concert Party, which was soon crowded, there were three Ladies &amp; three Gentlemen in the Party &amp; a very pleasant hour &amp; a half was spent as each item was received with applause, at 7.30 the National Anthem was sung &amp; away we came, As I had been on the go from 5 am I was fairly tired &amp; after having a Blanket handed to each of us I soon made myself comfortable on the floor &amp; asleep, The Bugle rang out at 4 am Tuesday 25th &amp; soon all hands were up &amp; handed in our Blanket &amp; after a Wash away for Breakfast repeating the same precudure as we did</p>
