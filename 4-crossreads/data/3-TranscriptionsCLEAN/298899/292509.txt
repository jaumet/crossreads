  
 half an hour. Saw several damaged guns go back also some lorries & caterpillars which had been knocked & burnt. Altogether a wonderful day, one to demonstrate our ferver & the wonder of our organisation. What the result of our hopover was we do not know yet for certain. The noise of the artillery was fearful. 
 Thursday 27th Sept 1917 A much quieter day although we had a fair number of wounded through during the morning the night being much the same. Guns very quiet during the day but opened up on a counter attack of Fritz about 6 at night. Only had about 10 gas cases through & spent my time controlling the loading & unloading & forwarding dressings & supplies to the other posts. 
 Friday 28th Sept  A very quiet day, perhaps because Fritz was readjusting his gun positions our advance being close on a mile. Very few wounded coming in
