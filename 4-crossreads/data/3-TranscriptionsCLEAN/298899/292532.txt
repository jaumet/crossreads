  
 Sunday 28th October '17  Went up to see the ambulance which had shifted back a bit. Collected some mail & returned in time to turn in a 3 o'clock feeling very tired. Spoke about Paris leave again. Learnt that our crowd were given 12 M.M's & 1 D.C.M. The lucky ones all being good fellows. Weather fine still but cold. Night quiet. 
 Monday 29th October '17 Fine day so walked to Mont de Cats a small mount surmounted by a Monastery about 4 miles away. 'Tis the highest spot I have been on in France & the view obtained was splendid but spoilt for the day by being hazy. The Monastery & Abbey now used as a C.C.S.  Felt dead tired coming back as have had very little sleep lately turning in at 2 P.M. Bought some views of the place also of Godeswelveldt. Taubes over & plenty of bombing at night.
