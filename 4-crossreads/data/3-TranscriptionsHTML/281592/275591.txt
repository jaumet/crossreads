<p>lay a good way out and we just arrived at the gangway in time to escape a heavy shower of rain.</p>
<p>Others, who had left the pier a few minutes later had unpleasant experiences to themselves, but the onlookers had the time of their lives seeing the unfortunates coming aboard.</p>
<p>Their are some reckless men in our unit.  One party upset their boat as they were about to step on the gangway.  Luckily they all escaped with only a drenching in the water.  How the native got on with his water-logged boat I do not know.</p>
<p>S.H.G. to-night.</p>
<p>Mon. Dec 28th</p>
<p>Correspondence home etc.  Natives are busy round about the ship selling fruit, coconuts etc. and they are doing a roaring trade.  They are very keen business men these natives fruitsellers.  It takes a smart man to beat them.</p>
<p>It is glorious to stand and lean over the ship's rail at night time.  This night is very clear, the moon is shining brightly and appears to be straight above our heads.</p>
<p>Natives are busily engaged loading the ship with coal and filling its tanks with water.  These natives here do not work as hard or make so much noise as those who fill the coal bunkers at Port Said.</p>
