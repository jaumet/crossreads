<p>the Aid Post. We were not called up during the night. A great difference to the last place we were in, why we were here three days &amp; we were not over worked by any means.  My squad only had half a dozen carries.</p>
<p>16th May 1917<br/>Two years ago today, since I enlisted. At 9 a.m. we were relived by another ambulance &amp; told to report at the warm spot again. After walking about 5 miles we found that we were not required until tomorrow so had to walk right back to the main dressing station. Fritz observers spotted us &amp; things were fairly warm for a time, but luckily no one was hurt. You should have seen us run for our lives when Fritz started sending his coal boxes over.  The distance back must have been fully 6 miles so all were a little tired I can assure you. Arrived at the dressing station at 5 p.m. our small party were walking about since 9 a.m.   All</p>
