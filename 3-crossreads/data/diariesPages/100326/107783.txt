They seem to have a sort of platform going up probably for gas attack but our bombers hunted them out. This morning the dawn disclosed entanglements they had place in position probably ready made and then carried out in front afterwards and set up.
0925. Enemy's bombardment recommenced they have already put in 109 shells (1020 o'c), ours are replying with interest tearing the side out of the hill. Rifles quiet. Beach parties buildings piers and landing places. "Beachy Bill" picks off a few every day. Sunk an Egyptian ketch of iron timber close in ? shallow water. A few masts sticking up hereabouts marking different craft which have foundered. The "Majestic" was submarined just a few hundred yards out. The men in the trenches could see the periscope. She just turned over and is only just submerged. 1030. A "football" bounced on roof on this dugout and burst about 20 feet away air full of splinters and fumes. Large iron shell about size of football
