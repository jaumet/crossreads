sheets ready to move up. Had some breakfast very late, got in with the last batch without any rush. A nice drink of tea (with plenty of sugar) went well! Had a wash, cleaned my teeth & had a shave & felt much livened up. Watched an aeroplane rise up from the aviation ground nearby, & fly around - my word, he was a beauty, turned head over heels, corkscrewed round, fired his machine gun, & flew low over our tents home. Had a good dinner at the sergeants mess, just pinned up the stripe I took down in England, & went in with the other 4 chaps, it was nicer having your tucker brought to you on a plate, than being pushed & squeezed to get in early in the crush. Wrote short letters to mother & Elsie today, but they will be censored & I can't say where I am. The others went in to Calais after tea, but I didn't fancy the 5 mile walk back to the Overflow Camp so didn't go in, saw the town last evening. I went up to the Y.M.C.A. in camp, talk about a crowd!
