 There's nothing & never has been anything as fine as our lads - their cheeriness against all odds & discomforts & in the wards the difference when they are our own lads! Happily I'm in charge of an Enteric Ward of 42 beds & nearly all our boys. They do wonderfully well too T.G. but the variations in diet as comp with a civil & what we considered the typical Enteric order of things gives one positive fits of anxiety until one sees it work out O.K. 
 My dear I am wondering & hoping that you have seen the advt that all Xmas things for No 3. A.G.H. can be sent c/- of the Secs: to a room (Receiving depot) at Winchcombe Carson's who will also send on all goods: Mrs Syd. Jamieson & Louie other lady are the Secs. I'm not begging for myself dear but we should be so grateful for gifts for our men in Comforts foods delicacies wines &c. &c. ad lib: Just at present we expect to be put on 1/2 Rations next week as the Ordnance Dep "through whom all supplies come state that 2 or 3 of our large supply ships have been sunk so that Xmas looks like a time for fasting & prayer rather than a festival Season for us! - if you & your friends address parcel c/- of me - I shall see to a judicious distribution of same & shall be intensely grateful - We are still in tents & feeling the cold a great deal at times. I've had a sharp attack of dysentery but easing off a bit now - of course am still on duty that goes without saying
