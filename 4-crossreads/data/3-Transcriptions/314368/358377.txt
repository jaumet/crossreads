<p>Duston War Hospital<br/>June 24th 1917<br/>Dear Mother and Father<br/>I received another three letters from home a couple of days ago, and also one from Florrie Dorman.  I was very glad to know that all at home were still quite ok and Aub's little message on the back of one of Ida's notes pleased me very much and I will be looking forward to getting a few more letters from him. Also I was glad to get a note from Mrs Dorman when she was staying at home, and I would like you to let her know mother when you write or see her next.</p>
<p>I am very glad to be able to tell you mother that my ankle is healing up well, I can now walk with a stick and I can get a boot on, provided it is not laced too tight. I daresay it will not be a great while before I am marked for convalescent now, there is very little to do at the hospital, but I manage to pass the time away by helping the doctor and sister a little. If I make myself useful you see they may not like to part with</p>
