<p>it was some hours before I (after asking many policemen) was put on the right track.</p>
<p>The following day I took train from Paddington and duly arrived at Witney. I had not given my relations any notice of my intended arrival. I just wanted to go alone through the old place and live over again my boyhood.</p>
<p>It was all like a dream after my long absence. The same streets, the same names in the shop windows, everything seemed just as it was when&nbsp;I&nbsp;left.
