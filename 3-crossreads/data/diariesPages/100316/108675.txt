23/5/18 Franvillers 
Another warm day. Some of the airbombs last evening landed close enough. Sat on a Court all day with Colonel Cohen Clowes re artillery shots. Heard a great many different witnesses. Formal mess in the evening and we had the Band out and playing well. Most of the men were out tonight on engineering tasks. Very busy all the evening on the question of honours and awards there is a tremendous lot of work in these things. Just about dark the enemy put over a fair number of shells some of which landed close to here. Tried a few cases of a.w.l. and desertion at Orderly Room tonight. The War is a pleasant business these days lying as it does in pleasant places and in good weathers. All the higher Commanders are awaiting the push and in the meantime he appears to be holding his line thinly and no doubt is resting his men well in rear. Last night here a number of artillerymen and a few civilians were killed and wounded and horses were also hurt by bombs from the planes. Down at Lassoussage they have also had a good deal of trouble from the same thing. Our painters are busy painting Crosses and also marking our machine guns and m.w's captured.
