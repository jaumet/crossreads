28/7/17 Amiensglass.  On the intersecting canals are many sampan like punts.  The train discipline of the men was excellent and we had absolutely no trouble at all.  At Amiens the train pulled up at the public platforms and some girls came along collecting for the wounded.  It does the men good to see a little of the softer side of life.  We ran out to Vignacourt and the country was very open and beautiful fertile rolling plains covered with waving corn.  The terrain runs in gentle folds with occasional big hollows which would be marvellous from the point of view of attack or defence.  As the line wound about we kept getting glimpses of the high standing Cathedral of Amiens with its tapering slender spire looking out over these plains as it has done now for more than 700 years.  After leaving Vignacourt we ran into very pretty country hills and dense woods with the most delicious shades of green and song birds of all kinds singing in the trees.  Night came on and we continued to run through idyllic country.  The whole Division is on wheels today! Arrived at
