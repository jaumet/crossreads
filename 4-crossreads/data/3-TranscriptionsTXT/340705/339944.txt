need to repeat it in this.
I am enclosing in this several [indecipherable] prints.  They are not good, owing (i) to the fact that I don't know the camera to well yet, and (ii) a slight defect in same (not me, the camera I mean).  If you get the one of myself intensified, it may make a good print.  (Note the bonza Farmer & Co. cardigan.)
I was very sorry to hear that [indecipherable] had failed.  Remember him to me (and to all our pals) & wish him better luck next time, for me.
Nothing else this week, will send some more films on, at an early date.
Ever your affectionateEric.
Enclosed (if it passes the Censor) you will find a post card, giving you some idea of where we are.
Also a few negatives of interest.  The one of myself can be improved by getting it intensified.
