Clean underclothing is issued to everyone & while they are having a warm bath their clothes are disinfected. Every man who shows signs of chat marks is kept back for special treatment. The whole 1,000 men are put through in the one morning. The details of the scheme I did not master as all arrangements are in the hands of the Base Staff & the officers themselves go in for a warm bath
At 2 pm we shift camp to AIBD I previously went over in the morning & reserved a bed. Was told none is available but there are many here who recognise me & a bed is forthcoming. Here the company is again taken over & we have nothing to do save go on leave. I & Allen (39th Bn) decide to go in but first we must listen to a lecture by adjutant re leave etc.
There are no trams running now as there is a tram strike on. So having missed the 1.20 pm train we must walk. It is hot & sultry & we proceed very slowly but manage the trip in 65 minutes Arrived in Havre we take a cool draught of English beer in Hotel de la Gare & most refreshing I find it & now quite. Then we wander around town.
Allan sends telegrams & I encounter old friends from Rouen & then I take Allen down to club where I met Ferguson. Together we visit a photographer & I get 6 pc. & then
