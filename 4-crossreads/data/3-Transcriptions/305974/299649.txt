<p>21 Thursday<br/>We play cards, dice &amp; read to pass our time away.  Everything is still very quiet.  Saw a couple of thrilling air raids by our airman this evening, my word there are some very brave men in the flying corps.  Nearly all of us went rat hunting in the evening but only accounted for two.  We used ascenteline gas to blow them out of their holes, but they were too quick for us.</p>
<p>22 Friday<br/>Nothing doing all day, bar a bit of a sick parade &amp; a couple of sick fellows who were to go to hospital, we have a couple of these fellows everyday, most of them suffering from influenza, I suppose the change of the climate is responsible for this.  A German Airoplane flew over Dickebusch &amp; dropped a few bombs but only added more destruction to the houses.</p>
<p>23 Saturday<br/>We have visits nearly every day by German airoplanes, but they are soon beaten back by our own guns &amp; airoplanes, there was supposed to have been one brought down by our antiair craft guns yesterday.  It is a beautiful day today.  I wasn't feeling to well though.</p>
<p>24 Sunday<br/>It takes me all my time to keep the chats under, there are plenty here &amp; whats more they breed very quickly.</p>
