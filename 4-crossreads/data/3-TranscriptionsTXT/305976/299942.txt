Saturday Nov 24Jaffa fine town & the largest I have seen in Palestine. It has one main street. Large Town Hall, Gardens, Band Stand & the outlying portions of Jaffa is very pretty. The Convent here is a very fine large airy building built of stone. The French civilian hospital is also a massive place. Germans principally occupied the best houses & one on going into the Town can easily realise what a hold Turkish capital had here. We pitched our camp on some beautiful white sand situated handy to the Surf & Town. Hope we have a decent spell here
