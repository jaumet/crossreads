Egypt 19.2.16.
My Dear Mother
Your letter dated 9th Jan. reached me safely yesterday. Thank Betty for hers I will write her one soon. I have not received your letter yet telling me that Stafford was abroad the Troopship, the other had that Bett. mentioned in her note is in the same company that I am in. I think I told you in my last letter that I had been out to the Pyramids, we Intended making a second trip someday, but I do not think that we will be able to do so now. I saw one of the Egyptian Cammel drivers having some fun with three of his long legged Brutes, one of them, was a bit obstinate and would not lead freely so the Gyppo commenced jerking the rope. This annoyed the Dromedary some and he rushed the Gyppo and tried to bite but only managed to secure part of the mans head-dress The Gyppo was scared some and ran like a scorched rabbit, long legs was tied to the other Camels and could not follow so had to wait for his "master" to return, as soon as that individual did, long legs went for him again, this went on for some time untill the Camel, and the man were just about thoroughly roused, The Camel frothing at the mouth, and he man standing off talking and although we could not understand him I'll wager that what he was saying was far from complimentary to that Camel, eventually some of our boys who were near went to his assistance, and after a little persuasion with a good heavy cane, Legs decided that he would be safer lying down. Some of the Camels are far from safe and so far I have not felt inclined to go for a ride on one from the look of them, as they shuffle along. I think that I would prefer a good lively horse, ? I saw Alf Phillips a few
