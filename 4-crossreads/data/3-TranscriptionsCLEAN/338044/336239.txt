  
 the front, have a strong certificate from the doctor recommending me for field work. This I lodged (with an application for transfer to the firing line) to Capt Parker, who as much as refused, but this time I am determined to see the thing through & I'll get to the front this time or go back home. Have had enough half & half business   The usual [droll?] monotony of casualties until 12.30 pm & we have the afternoon off duty. Take a long walk out of the other side of the city to that which we have traversed lately. Many hospitals &  general depot camps here from which the troops proceed to the front. No 1 Aust General Hospital. No 6  & 10 General (English) Hospitals. All in large marquee tents. Several convalescent hospitals also Indian hospital & camp.
