<p>Mametz, Bazentin&ndash;le-Petit, Delville Wood, Front line, Longueval 4/11/16 At 11am we moved from Mametz and owing to an order not having been issued early enough there was some mix up in the issue of rations and some chaps had to carry sandbags full which proved a heavy burden for them.  The sun was shining as we plugged through the mud and water and we found the main road crowded with transport and troops. At rear of our columns we had a guard with prisoners and as they had bayonets fixed it caused some comments from the Tommies we passed.  Long strings of mules with little baskets for carrying shells kept passing us.  The march was an exhausting one and there were very few spells given by the CO.  Rode along with the doctor shepherding lame ducks.  All the time we were passing through little camps and bivouacs where troops were moving &amp; as far as the eye could reach the trenches crossed our track everywhere.  At one point we passed a cemetery which was completely torn to bits and on a fragment of one tombstone ironically enough there was inscribed  "Concessiar des [indecipherable].  After leaving Balentin-le-Petit guides met us and "B" was switched off to Longueval.  Went on with the remainder. Delville Wood has been a large wood but has been tremendously strafed and all the trees are ruined.  Tram lines run through and there are plenty of big guns.  We had to be careful in passing not to mask the fire of batteries.  Shells were landing round and we had one man hit.  Coming out of the wood we encountered open ground over which the going was heavy and we had to dodge a good many [indecipherable] which were dropping round closely.  From one high point we were rewarded by a splendid view of the whole front.  Stretching straight in front was undulating country and we could see Bapaume quite distinctly.  Away on the right an attack was in progress and we could see barrages on which turned a line of trench into a line of white smoke.  Something similar was doing on the left and the smoke hung round in the wreaths like a fog.</p>
