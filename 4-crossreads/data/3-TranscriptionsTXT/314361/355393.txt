From Albert I &amp; a few others went to the details camp which is just outside. We stayed there the night, slept in a tent &amp; got breakfast there also, there I picked up another 55th man &amp; we were sent on, was told that the [indecipherable] was near Montanban. Well I had about a seven or eight mile walk that morning, ate our dinner at a YMCA tent on the way. At about 2.30 pm we met some of the battalion going to this camp, so we just followed them. This is a terrible mud hole of a place, there are duckboards to walk on, to keep one up. I saw on a road here horses &amp; transports, the horses pulling through slushy mud, up to the axle of the waggons, it was a terrible strain on the horses. The battalion has just came out of the trenches &amp; I think is moving back to billet in a couple of days. DernancourtDec 19th 16 Left Montanban about 10 Am arrived in this village about 1.45.
