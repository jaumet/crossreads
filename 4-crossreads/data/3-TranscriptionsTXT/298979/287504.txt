 Up till this time our Company had existed on the biscuits &amp; bully beef each man had brought along in his haversack, water being obtained from shell holes just at the back of the duck board walk but as the Medical Officers had examined &amp; condemned this water as unfit for drinking purposes, fatigue parties were organized to go back to the dump a matter of about 2 miles for rations &amp; on our left about half a mile thence back along a duck board walk, for water.
