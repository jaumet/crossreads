<p>27 Saturday</p>
<p>Great day preparing for party to Bolnicars in evening.  It went with vim &amp; we all seemed to enjoy it.  Plenty to eat and drink.  Played games heartily.  Wound up with Kola &amp; 2 National anthems.  Perfect weather.  Slight frost for I had just a suggestion of chilblains.</p>
