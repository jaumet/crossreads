<p>My Dearest Mother</p>
<p>I'm just scribbling this to catch the pilot boat before she returns to port. By the time you get it we will be well out on old ocean &amp; I am led to believe that it will be some time before we touch a port from which we can write. All day yesterday we spent in embarkation &ndash; there was a dickens of a crowd, including many Sydney lads &amp; the ships looked fine.  Our boat is first rate though small. Fitted up A1 &amp; tucker of the best. Heaven only knows how we will employ ourselves &ndash; I expect that we'll be bribing the stokers to give us something to do before we reach the cold country. Am very fit &amp; well, like the rest, &amp; enjoy the change in tucker especially. We expected to be hung up in port for a few days, but it did not come off thank goodness. Must close now with love to all &amp; heaps for yourself &ndash; don't worry, we're going to have a fine time on this old tub or I'm much mistaken.</p>
