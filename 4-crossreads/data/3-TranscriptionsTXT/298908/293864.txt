just as the first Sgt. started to clear the door old Woods steps out & there he stood thunderstruck while we hopped out like rabbits from a warren & away in all directions.In the afternoon we were supposed to have a kit inspection so we took all our gear out but it was a blind for all they wanted were the men with military pieces of equipment all we were allowed to keep are the gas masks only everything else has to be handed in.  You should have seen the pile of stuff that was collected.Another draft for the boat was also called out, they took from K to Z so I missed this lot again.  I am just about sick of the whole damn business putting it off from week to week like they have been doing its enough to make anyone sick & I like the rest of the lads am just about fed up with England as it is possible to be.  We are all longing to be on our way home & until we get a move on towards that end nothing
