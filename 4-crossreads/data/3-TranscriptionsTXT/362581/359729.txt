I have just received your lovely letter with Mummie's   &  you are a very clever boy writing such a nice one to  you auntie Eadle. Hope you will have a very happy Xmas and that Santa will bring  you lots of presents.You must give Grandma, Aunties   &  Mummie a big hug and kiss for me. Especially on Xmas morning. I shall be thinking to you and hope you will all have as happy a time as you possibly can. Heaps of hugs   &  kisses for your dear little self. This picture shows the road that leads to the Pyramids.
