<p>7.45 pm, last service on board, very fine.</p>
<p>Monday 6/12/15<br/>Much cooler today.  Passed large Orient Steamer on Port bow about 8.15 AM, bound probably for Sydney.  From bow saw large shoal of Dolphins. Fine to see them playing about practically against the nose of the boat; gradually they drop away one or two at a time until they have all gone.  Held fine concert at night, each of the 18 of us had to contribute to the programme.  My item, "Always take a girl named Daisy" went very large," I don't think".  As each item was announced a few lines were read out about each</p>
