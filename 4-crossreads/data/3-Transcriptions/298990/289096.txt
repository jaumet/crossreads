<p>Dernacourt, Vignacourt &amp; Flessells 1/12/16  A cold clear morning which later became very foggy. All our valises and surplus gear had gone ahead yesterday but we had a motor lorry to carry one blanket per man and a little mess gear.  Passed the starting point past the old church at 9.45 am and marched to Edgehill some Grenadier Guards being in front of us.  Big railway yards here and much traffic on road and rail.  Formed up on some open ground and sent the fellows over in batches of 8.  Entrainment was done in good order and time and we set off at 12.15. About 3000 men aboard - a large train.  Crawled along to Amiens.  Noticed many Germans at work and also once more observed how the French always put old men on their guards and also by having a good military system they just put uniforms on their workers and the army runs the railways etc themselves and only pay the low army wage.  Tedious stoppages occurred en route and then we actually passed Flessels &ndash; went past it.  They detrained us some miles ahead and marched us back.  That's the Army all over &ndash; once before they took us 14 miles past a station we were to billet at and then sent us back trudging on foot.  Fritz does not do these things.  It was as cold as one could imagine in the train and we did not reach Vignacourt until 7 pm.  Detrained and marched to Flessels.  Grooms had our horses waiting.  A bright moonlight night with frosty cutting air and ice on the roads.  Swung along good roads and reached Flessels and good billets of which more tomorrow.  Fine bedroom with sheets &amp;other comforts.</p>
