  
 Fri. Jan.3 (cont.) After Tea we passed a pleasant Hour in a Picture Show near the Alhambra. Quite the best I was ever in. There was a fine Pipe Organ & somebody could play it real good. The "Bing Boys" was good, but not so good as I expected. I have seen shows equally as good in Sydney & Melbourne (to my mind, anyhow). George Robey is very funny & Violet [indecipherable] is real good too. What struck me was that there was not a decent singer in the whole Show. V. [indecipherable] sang a very fine song "The old Love" but she had not a very good voice. As usual it was raining, but we were lucky enough to get a train. Had supper before returning. Sat. Jan. 4. Had Break at War Chest. It is easily the best place (for a man of limited means) in London to get a feed. After Break strolled around City. Saw changing of Guard at Whitehall. Imposing, but useless ceremony. Raining , of course. It is muchh lighter in the City at night than in the day time, now that the Lights are permitted. 
 Jan.4.(cont.) In London on 4 days Leave. London is full of soldiers, & it's difficult to get a seat at a Threatre or obtain a Bed, & the Restaurants always seem to be crowded. Went to Coliseum at night. Good show. Very fine orchestra. Max Rarewski conductor. Several first class items. One Performing Seal was really marvellous. It was almost human. The Russian Ballet is [indecipherable] a lot, but I didn't care for it much. Jan 5. Sunday. Attended morning Service at Westminster Abbey. The singing was beautiful but the service was dry as dust. No wonder people don't attend Church; the Services are so monotonous & dreary. On my way to Dinner met Bill [indecipherable] so I hopped on to a Train & went & had dinner with him at a place in "the Strand". They charged us 4/6 each, & I was still hungry. Being Sunday there was not much doing, so we went for a stroll down "Petticoat Lane" & saw some really remarkable Bargains. Bill bought a pair of kid Gloves for 8/-.
