Something here made me think hard & at last I remembered it. In an old magazine under heading "Curiosities – you will find a photo of a monkey food tree (kind of fig) that has rooted on top of an old wall. The roots bound up a section of wall & still hold it – the rest of the structure having long since disappeared. On either side at foot stand an old [indecipherable] gun. The structure was an old slaver’s look out tower. Theres a big rockery garden in front in which, by the way, lives a dreaded Green snake about 8 feet long. We killed one of his descendants, a youth 18 inches long with fangs like rat’s teeth. On the ridge back of this live boas up to forty feet long. One killed only yesterday, measured 34 feet. They are looked on as common. The Koli snake a green & gold beauty with a whip tail of bright orange, is another terror. He’s very deadly & hard to see. Also grows big. Two at the observation station, alive, measure 6 feet & 8 feet respectively. Four of our chaps so far have had narrow squeaks.
