<p>Bulford<br/>26.3.17<br/>Dear Mum,<br/>As I have not written since the 16th I have a little news.  This is strange but I've been to Salisbury &amp; London since then &amp; I'll tell You most of my Travels.  On St Patrick's Day I kidded Dave to walk over to see the Village Blacksmiths &amp; Home.  We just arrived at the Spreading Chestnut &amp; bumped into Billy Ali, who had walked round from Lark Hill with some of His mates.  We supped with them &amp; walked Home round the Road with them for Company instead of across the Fields which was our nearest route.  I was very tired when I got Home as it is a 7 mile walk.  On Sunday I played the Hymns for Kirk as usual &amp; also for the Y.M.C.A. Chap from W. Aust. &amp; I walked to Amesbury, 3 miles distant, &amp; took Motor to Salisbury.  We straightway made for the Famous Cathedral &amp; as service was in full swing we took our places about halfway along the Cathedral.  Sermon came on but I could not hear.  Unless one is near the Pulpit it is very hard to hear.  The Parsons voice rolls all round the Top of the Cathedral &amp; all one hears is echoes.  After Service one of the Clergy took us round &amp; shewed us the Tombs of the various bygone celebrities whose remains were interned in the Cathedral.  It would take a long time to tell You all that I was told &amp; indeed I have already forgotten many things.</p>
