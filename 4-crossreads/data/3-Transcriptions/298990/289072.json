<p>Delville Wood 12/11/16  Colonel Forbes was here early and arranged to have a yarn at 3 pm today.  Dull misty moon with considerable artillery activity.  Most unpleasant smell pervading the tent we have regretfully come to the conclusion that it is pitched over some corpses and that we are sitting on top of some dead bodies. We lazily decline to inquire too far into this as we might have to shift the tent if we found such to be the case.  The Brigade Major rang me up before lunch and wanted me and the company here to move up "toutes de vite" to the front line.  Issued orders and commenced a hurried packing up and was just about to start when he rang up again for me to remain here but for all the men to go ahead.  At 3pm all the officers save Fraser and Anderson, and all the men except some sick, pushed off and left the tents empty.  As yesterday a fog came up before dusk.  It was pitch dark at 4.45 and a very heavy and sustained bombardment then commenced.  Rumoured that the Scotch did a successful advance and that our 5th &amp; 7th Bdes have a stunt on the 14th inst.  About 6.15 pm the Germans commenced violent cannonade evidently a counter attack and our guns replied.  We are nearly stunk out tonight by the smell of dead men buried in this tent.  It permeates everything and the stink seems to hang in the air in gusts.  We shall shift the tent tomorrow.</p>
<p>13/11/16  6.15 am Intense and sustained furious bombardment for &frac12; hour along all our front here.  Furpheys. (1) That on 23rd Germans have requested armistice and are retiring into their own territory!!  (2) 7th Bde going direct to Marseilles (3) Guards marching up to take Bapaume (4) 3rd Div. retained in England under orders from Australia.  Colonel Watson leaves for England and Fitzgerald takes over.  Foggy day.</p>
