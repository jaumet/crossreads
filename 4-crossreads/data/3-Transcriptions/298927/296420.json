<p>17th  Left Perham Downs 12 noon for Wareham played off by No 1 Com. Depot band<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Wareham Camp is a home. Uptodate cook houses Huts, mess tables etc.  It is a fine town very picturesque, the second oldest town in England.  There is a bridge with the inscription that "anybody damaging it etc is liable to be transported for life"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish this by law was in vogue now as it undoubtedly meant Australia or Van Dieman's Land now</p>
