Lillian. I would like you to have a little Roll of Honour for the Swastikas and any information that you want I will be glad to give you in regards to service, dates or names in full. After being two months in England in hospital and on sick leave am now at Perham Downs it is rather cold and not at all pleasant.I have a position on the staff here so expect to be here for a little while yet. Why I put the above address is that if I have gone to France, my letters will reach me direct instead of going to France and then back here, it makes it much easier if you have an address in England to send your things.
Am enclosing a card with a verse on it which will give you some idea of "Perham Downs."
To-morrow we are having a day of gifts from the Red Cross, and Church Service which I hope will be a success, weather permitting. All the men here are fast recovering from wounds or illnesses, so we want to give them as good a time as possible. Well dear Sister am rather late but I sincerely hope that you all have a most Bright and Successful New Year.
Love to all your Swastika Brother Wallace
