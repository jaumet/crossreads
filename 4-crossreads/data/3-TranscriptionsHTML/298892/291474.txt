<p>C Company&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3rd letter)<br/>18th Battalion,<br/>Casula.<br/>Friday, 12th November 1915.</p>
<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother/.<br/>I received your letters during the week and I will do as father says regarding the notice to<br/> Saddington.</p>
<p>Twelve thousand men left our camp at Holdsworthy for Liverpool last Friday. They made a very fine show marching out with bands playing and colours flying. It left the camp fairly empty but crowds of new men have been coming in daily since.<br/>We are now among the more experienced men at the camp the others being, for the most part "Marmalades." (The name given to all new recruits).<br/>We struck camp this morning and marched to Casula from Holdsworthy.</p>
