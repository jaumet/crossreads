<p>pleasant &amp; exciting.  We left here with a convoy 1 mile long for a 40 mile trip across the Desert.  On the way the route passed through the 2 dead Cities of Egypt &amp; although I was only able to view same from my horse it was decidedly interesting.<br/>The Arabs were in their thousands as being good Friday they all go to the Cities to pray for their ancient ancestors.<br/> The track was very narrow in places &amp; needed great care to safeguard the Convoy.<br/>After passing the Cities we emerged onto the Desert &amp; then began a weary trip.  We had to halt every hour or so to spell the horses &amp; water them.  The fine sand was very troublesome as it fills your eyes &amp; nose &amp; nearly suffocates you.  My eyes are all blood shot to-day on account of same.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful sight to see the Convoy stretched out over the sandy ridges just for all the world like a giant snake.<br/>We passed through Maadi which is where the Turkish Prisoners are camped &amp; proceeded to the outskirts of the town to pick up our loads.</p>
