<p>Maud De Vere behind the bar</p>
<p>Thought she like to be a star</p>
<p>She did a turn somewhere in France</p>
<p>But the first time that she tried to dance</p>
<p>La&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; um</p>

<p>Private Smith of the A.I.F</p>
<p>Alas, he was so very deaf</p>
<p>The doctors he had beaten off</p>
<p>Til at last he bumped old</p>
<p>Major toff</p>
<p>He fell &amp; came a gutser</p>
<p><s>And so he came a gutser</s></p>
