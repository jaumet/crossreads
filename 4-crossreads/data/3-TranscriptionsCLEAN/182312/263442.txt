                                     8th INSTALMENT.  
  1st. November, 1916.        I have lately had an opportunity of 
 visiting the Grand Fleet as a guest of the Admiralty and seeing 
 what is lying in wait for the German Navy should they ever come

 were entirely ignorant of, and to the latter because they like 
 visitors and can learn something first hand of the doings of the

 the North Sea whilst strained eyes constantly search the waters 
 round about for the dreaded German periscopes not knowing when a 
 torpedo might get home and send a ship and her highly trained crew

 does not lose any sleep over the matter:  the pianola still prospers 
 in the Ward Room, the men's Cinema goes on uninterrupted every night, 
 the ship's band plays for the Officers' mess as usual, the Officers 
 and men show no signs of weariness or strain and over all there is 
 that air of confidence - confidence because they know themselves. 
      I spoke to many men on that visit including the 
 gallant Sturdee and in every case I was struck by their gentleness, 
 their modesty, their complete freedom from anything small or 
 trifling in the way of swagger or vanity.  I think their gentleness 
 struck me more than anything else.  They were splendid to look at, 
 so strong, so healthy, so well groomed, so cheerful, and so confident;
