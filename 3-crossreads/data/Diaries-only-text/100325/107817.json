Battalion drill. General Legge out and had good talk with him. Remarked carrying rifles ? trail no good in file slung across right arm best. In South Africa always used that method himself easy to slip it down across saddle. General Legge faithful to Australian hat. Smart march in, sent band right out to meet the column.
Morning ? rumours more circumstantial. Sorted out kit and repacked trunk. Quite ready for action now.
12 noon. Had long talk with Brigadier Elmiger Batson to return. ? Bazeley, Stockfield King recommended for comms.
Evening. Advanced rear Guard
Definite word arrived from Bde. H.Q. that we move on Monday next. Great celebration in mess.
