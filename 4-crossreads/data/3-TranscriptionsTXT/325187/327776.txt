[Following paragraph is crossed out]Letter from Mother & Joe written on Xmas day so that is not bad  I should have called but guessed the Papers would let you know we had left ANZAC.We are expecting Gen Birdwood here this afternoon he is a popular Officer with the Australians & N. Zealanders & we all recognise he got us away from ANZAC very cleverly.Will post these notes with love to all it is great luck to think all my notes have reached you & of late, your letters have also been delivered most regularly.
