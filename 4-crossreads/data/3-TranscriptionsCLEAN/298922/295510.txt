Our last stunt was spoilt by Bedouin spies. We are too easy on these pests who are all against us. Rob our dead & have a lot of equipment picked up from the Baltic fields.  Our equipment is excellent & every thing Australia has supplied has been excellent. Tommy Officers are loud in praise of our Boots. Good old Australian Rabbit Skin HATS are better than any others issued & the same applies to TUNICS PANTS etc. Last night an order appeared saying Rabbit Skins must be left in the sun & returned to the Quarter Master daily. We still get frozen Rabbit issued.
