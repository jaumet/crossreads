<p>France<br/>12th Aug. 1916</p>
<p>My dear Father,<br/>Your letter of 11th June to hand yesterday, for which I thank you very much.  Walter dropped in to see me for about 10 minutes this afternoon, &amp; I thought he was looking very well.  We are all on the move again tomorrow so that I suppose it will be some time before I see him again.<br/>Very hot here this week even for summer, but the nights are always cool, &amp; often cold.<br/>Harvesting operations are in full swing here now, &amp; it is an eye-opener to see the way the women work.  They have the Massey-Harris</p>
