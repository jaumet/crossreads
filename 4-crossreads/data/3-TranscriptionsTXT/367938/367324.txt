a bullet torn flag wh. has done duty for us marking the end of our position for some weeks. Originally a red & yellow signalling flag - the shaft shows many bullet holes. I hope you will get it.
An extra gust of wind has just torn my blanket roof & taken it down the Sharia. We are road making & our avenue running up is from 20' to 12 ft wide & very good - (No trains [yet?] as they bring the dust so). I have a notice here on it "Jo Stamboul" to encourage the fatigue parties.
There are a few dead Turks within a couple of hundred yds from us & Holman & I are considering how we can together get their arms. - Am afraid their curios are past getting as they must have been here quite a time! My bivouac area I am trying to keep as clean as a peace camp, tho' an awful task as men throw food everywhere. However we have an incinerator & all sorts of sanitary conveniences.
The gully is very pretty - hung with fir trees - lupins, oak bushes - purple pea like flowers & the broom. - - -
