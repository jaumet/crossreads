 1918 Sun 24th Feb. Our best meal for many months was at 6 p.m. 
 Beef (yes, Beef!), beetroot, potatoes, and coffee ersatz (that word Ersatz (substitute) was to become well-know to us). 
 We gorged till we could gorge no more, and then the hungry German sentries came in and devoured the scraps. 
 Tue. 26th. Yesterday a procession of doctors dug around all over me, consulted my Doc's report, &amp; mumbled "operation".    Today I moved to the hospital proper. 
 The hospital is the Festungs-lazarelt, Kiel-Wik, &amp; consists of about 10 separate buildings, each complete and detached, yet all connected up by underground tunnels. 
 I am in Haus B, ward 25. 
 The wards are small, comfortable, &amp; beautifully lighted &ndash; a row of big windows stretching right across one wall.
