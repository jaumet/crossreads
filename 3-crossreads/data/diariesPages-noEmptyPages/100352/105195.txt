We accordingly went on guard at the 2 M.S. Store. No excitement during the day as usual Jackson went to the hospital with fever. At night time passed very enjoyably watch the Germans signalling to each other by way of a little sweet pastime at midnight
Friday 16th Oct.
Marched out again early in the morning I two others pushed a cart ahead of us. The object of the trip was we ultimately found out, to cut down a tree for a wireless pole, as the one we have is useless. We located a beauty after putting ropes all over it and cutting it down it fell across a log broke in two. Another was found cut down. We spent all the afternoon dragging it into position then marched home.

On guard again. Poor old Wakley was carried to the hospital with an unknown complaint. Personally I think he has pneumonia as he is subject to it as Watson has also had it
