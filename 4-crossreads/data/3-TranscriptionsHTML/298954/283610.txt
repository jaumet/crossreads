<p>1918<br/>Thu 4th Apl.<br/>We left Cassel for Frankfurt-am-Main at about 5.30 pm.</p>
<p>The country here is beginning to look more like the Germany of which one reads.</p>
<p>North Germany is just dreary monotony seen from a train window, but here it is different.</p>
<p>Of course Spring has arrived already here in the south, perhaps that makes the difference.</p>
<p>Colne is a funny little town with the exterior walls of most of the houses faced with large tiles (apparently glazed) on which are painted crude figures of birds, etc.  The female peasant costume so much in evidence here consists of a short "crinolined" effect terminating just below the knees;  a tiny bunched headdress, and heel-less velvet shoes.</p>
