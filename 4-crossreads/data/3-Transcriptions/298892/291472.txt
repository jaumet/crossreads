<p>Number 4 is a boy of 17. He is nothing in particular. Seems a decent sort but endeavours to convince the others that he is a man by swearing as much as possible.<br/>Number 5 is "Sinker" a real character. His father keeps a laundry. He is only a boy and is very anxious to get on at the drill. His chief amusement is playing poker for pennies.  He cleaned the tent out, barring Stirling and myself, last week, but this week "Jim Flynn" is champion and holds all the spare cash.<br/>Number 6 is "Allslops" an ingenious diversion of his name Hislops. It suits him too. He is lazy and dirty. A mild enough individual without much spirit but when anything is mislaid in the tent it turns up among his belongings. I only refer to military kit tin plates, knives forks &amp; such like, I  don't think he would take any private belongings.<br/>Number 7 is "Lizzie". He is a real hard doer. Comes from off a station. He is very good natured and we are always having jokes at his expense. He is an inveterate smoker and is always looking for matches. He smokes them in much the same way as Kevin used. He thinks nothing of waking one at one or two O'clock in the morning with his drawled " Hey! Hey! Gius a match".<br/>Number 8 is the "Boston Burglar". The day we arrived he came into camp drunk with a whiskey flask in his pocket and a bottle of beer</p>
