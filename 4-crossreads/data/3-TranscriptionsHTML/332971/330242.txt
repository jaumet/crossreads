<p>I hoped never to mention inoculation again but Cholera has broken out &amp; there is a notice up for us all to be done again.  Experience has taught me that its easier to take it &amp; beat it than it is to try and get out of it but how I do hate it.  It seems a funny thing it breaking out with out boys.  The Turks diddent get it &amp; Theresa  strong suspicion that cholera germs were put in the drinking water.  Isnt that a wicked thing to do?  Then sad news has just arrived to say that at the "Taj" Mahar in Bombay one OC &ndash; his orderley &amp; 3 Mos &amp; 2 of our Sisters all died suddenly of it.  It gave us quite a shock.  The 2 Sisters O'Grady &amp; Power were with us here &amp; such bonnie girls.  Now the question arises was it Cholera they died of or were they poisoned.  What a History Australia will have to tell when the war is over.</p>
<p>Sept 1st  Our wattle day but I diddent realise it until this evening.  Our Hospital was all astir early this morning in getting away over 300 of our boys &amp; sending them back to you.  I can imagine the reception you'll be giving these for what they have done.  To see them off &amp; the good byes just made me wish for awhile that I could go back with them.</p>
<p>In all the letters every one tells of the rain rain rain you are having.  Its beautiful isn't it to have the promise of such a good season?</p>
