Friday 28thDrew my clotheing & was turned out on the hard World Walked to Sand Hills camp & went through the formalities of Reporting Back. They would not own me in the Company I had left untill  I found a Groupe Orderly Room stuck away in the furthest corner & reported there. Then was once more taken into the fold & got blankets & settled down in the Hut I left a week before - Wonder how many different lots of blankets I have had in the army There allwalys an element of uncertainty about them some all very small some thread bare some dirty but taken all round have been fairly fortunate
