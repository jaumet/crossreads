Monday 8 February 19159 a.m. - The Pyramids as usual bathed in Sun. clouds often are overhead here, to an Australian portending rain, but the precious drops, never fall. The sands of the desert are filled with water worn stones from the size of a fist to the minutest particles. Large stones are white in colour & not water worn. Must ask someone about them. Climbed the pyramid this afternoon for the 2nd time. No difficulty. The sunset  gorgeous from the top.
