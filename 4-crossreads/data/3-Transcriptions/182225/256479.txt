<p>DEC.&nbsp;&nbsp; TUESDAY 26&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine &amp; frosty. Exercising horses in morning &amp; we had a full dress parade in afternoon. Had every-thing on &amp; we looked like a second hand shop. Lord knows how we will gett on when we have to carry them all &amp; every day. Went round &amp; saw old Pat Rutledge in evening. He is a Lieut. in 23<sup>rd</sup> Howitzer Brigade now.</p>
