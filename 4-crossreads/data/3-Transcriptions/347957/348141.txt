<p>CHAPTER 1.</p>
<p>"To Meet the Huns"</p>
<p>Our training in Egypt was thorough and severe, yet in the face of all that some impertinent writer had the audacity to send home reports that the Australian Boys were "resting in Egypt". Yes, and some of the boys are still resting there in consequence, but their history has been transmitted to paper by a far more practised pen than mine.</p>
<p>The allotted span for our stay in Egypt, this sandy, lice and fly infested country, being at last finished, we were then advised we had to meet the German Hun in Europe, and all were eager to get there to see for themselves how "Fritz" proved himself in battle. Having all our accoutrements packed, we were given the usual Egyptian Troop train journey to our port of embarkation.  The journey was done at night in open wagons, but when twenty or more men and their equipment are dumped in a truck, there is no more "open" space about it, but we fully realised that this train ride was more comfortable to us than a march would have been, as anybody who has marched in Egypt will testify.</p>
<p>At Alexandria we found our ship all ready and waiting. We embarked on the transport full of hope and expectations, and an awful feeling of contempt for the land we had just left.  The most exciting occurrence on board was in connection with our rations, which by no means allowed of any waste at all, and seldom proved sufficient to satisfy demands.  Our journey was accomplished without any serious mishap.  We were marched straight off the boat at the French Port, Marseilles, and into a train, which started us on our way to the great adventure about an hour later.  At Marseilles we saw our first German soldiers, who were working as prisoners on the wharf.  They appeared all big able bodied and strong men.</p>
<p>The change of scenery in La Belle France was like healing ointment to our sunbaked faces and dust filled eyes.  It seemed a veritable paradise, and it was hard to realise that in this land of seeming peace and picturesque beauty, one of the most fearful wars of all time was raging in the ruthless and devastating manner of "Hun" frightfulness. Life in France was infinitely better than in the land of sun and flies.  This was due to the fact that everything is better organised, and means of transport were not so difficult.  Our first pleasant surprise was when the Quartermaster issued to us "butter" (real "butter") to eat with our bread and biscuit, and we could get leave to visit the neighbouring villages and purchase fruit.  I was even able to get several pounds of strawberries, and best of all those beautiful, most delicious, currant loaves, which we had not seen for so long, much less tasted.</p>
<p>It was here we first witnessed Aerial Duels, which to us were most fascinating, more so if one could distinguish and follow their curves, dives and plunges, especially if our boys were holding the winning hand.  I have often see groups of boys either sitting or standing watching a duel from start to finish, and when one could see our victorious machines returning as gracefully as  the prettiest butterfly, it naturally gave us one and all a greater sense of security, to know that our boys could go up and watch any enemy movements and disperse his massing preparations.  The thrilling and soul inspiring sights of</p>
