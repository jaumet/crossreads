 10 April 1916 Mon It is 2 am as I write these few words &amp; as I look up &amp; out towards the firing line I see the signals &amp; reflections of the big guns &amp; the noise of them is terrific.

 11 April 1916 Tues Went around to the estaminet at 6.30 am for coffee with Marshall Rice. After breakfast Ken &amp; I spent the best part of the morning with Germaine &amp; Lawrence. Slept in the afternoon. Ken takes our photoes in the back yard of the estaminet. Beautiful singing by a tommie of Sheffield Choir [tone]
