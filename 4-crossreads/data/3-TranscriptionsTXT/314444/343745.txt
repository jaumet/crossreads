 In the Field, 1/10/17. 
 Dear Mrs. Hill. 
 Will you please accept my deepest sympathy? Words fail to express to you my sorrow at your loss. Tom was one of the finest examples of Australian soldiers. His fine manly qualities and his pluck, and determination were admired by everyone who had any dealings with him. I loved him &ndash; loved him for the example which he set and the courage which he daily instilled into everyone around him. 
 I would like to tell you that when he was wounded many of his men ran to him and he told them to carry on with their important work. He was brave up to the last and told the men he was still "playing" and still had a "Jersey". How like poor old Tom. In all your grief, Mrs. Hill, you have consolation of being the proud mother of a gallant hero &ndash; one who has sacrificed his all for the good of humanity and for our future safety. 
 When I heard of the disaster I rode several miles to the Dressing or Casualty Station only to be too late. His remains lie near by and the boys of his battalion are carefully looking after the grave and the erection of a suitable cross as a last tribute. His end has come as a very severe blow to them, and his name was passed from one to another all over this great fighting area. 
 Will you please remember me to Miss Hill? Have written Tom's Aunt in Oxford also. 
 With kind regards, Your sincere friend Phillip E. Potts. 
 Capt. &amp; Q.M. 2nd Pioneer Batt. A.I.F.
