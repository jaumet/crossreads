<p>for those who came down in the night, but I managed to get some porridge &amp; tea from the band who are here too. It is a scandal, the band never go in the line, nor do they fight, or even do fatigue work. After breakfast we had the luxury of a shave, as I hadn't had a shave or even washed my face for a week, it was some operation. There was a bath parade which I gladly went on. We marched up to Corbie to the military baths, &amp; had a hot shower &amp; change of clothes. We all stood under the hot showers, and soaped &amp; soaped, &amp; the trench dirt just rolled off us, especially our heads. It was a perfect treat to feel clean again; walked back to our camp, the eternal military traffic was passing through the streets, the smell of petrol from the motor lorries which pass by unceasingly day &amp; night, was vile, &amp; everywhere was dust. Went down a narrow lane full of motor lorries, into which Tommies were shovelling metal from railway trucks. There was hardly room to squeeze past, &amp; I don't know how the drivers got them there. It was bonza to see a train steaming along the line, another sign of the pushing back of the Hun. A fortnight ago, a train here would have been blown to</p>
