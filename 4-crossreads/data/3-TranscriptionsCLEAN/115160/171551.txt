 Dear Lock, 
 Thanks very much for the [indecipherable] papers you sent along.  It is a very queer case, and should leave a nasty taste in the mouths of the police even if they prove nothing.  If they do, it will reopen the [indecipherable] business altho' I think it has had a few set-backs of late. 
 I see things pursue their even tenor of their way in the shop and that weekly returns are satisfactory.  The Govt seems to be making all sorts of arrangements to protect the public
