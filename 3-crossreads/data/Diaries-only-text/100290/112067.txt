Very poor accom. For us or pati[indecipherable] Had to sit up all night, one carry. Poor unfortunate infantry trench feet. Bog up to thighs. Meet Bert Rauch Stewart Cowper. Harry also inquires. Still the bombardment goes on without a second's

Expect to be relieved tomorrow for 2 days. Received another budget of letters from Mary. M. Brodie Ess, Miss Bullin, Eva May, Bert Edwards. Good oh! all Aug. letters.
