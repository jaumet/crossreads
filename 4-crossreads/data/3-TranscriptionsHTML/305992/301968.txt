<p>at daylight. It being highly dangerous to pass nightime as the moon being near full &amp; very clear nights.<br/>At 3 pm April 22 passed Pantellaria Is. where the Italians have some of the latest motor submarine chasers on patrol.<br/>South of Sicily 8 pm passed the islands of Linosa &amp; Lampedusa having a lighthouse on each of these small islands which are lit at night &amp; unmolested probably on account of them being of as much use to the enemy submarines as position marks as to the Allied transports.<br/>1 am off Malta &amp; zigzagging all night for there is no arrangements for transports to go into Valletta Harbor at night. Well steam off the island until 8 am then 3 miles off the harbor. Kept outside steaming slow in shallow water until 1 pm surrounded by destroyers &amp; hydroplanes. This harbor being small &amp; conjested with shipping one transport only could go in at one time &amp; therefore had to wait our turn until each ship was moored so as to have the use of tugs. The Indarra being the last ship to go in was kept outside from 8 am to 1 pm. A splendid target for any Fritz's submarines.</p>
