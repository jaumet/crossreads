  
 all outside & took a few snaps.  I hope they turn out alright. Mr. Duke is going to send some flower seeds home he has some lovely ones & they will be pleased with them. I gave my things another bit of a overhaul.  Mr. Duke is going to hang on to them till I send for them after the war. Charlie & I left for London by the 10.17 train & picked up the express at Arundel.  She was crowded out so we hopped into a 1st Class compartment & stopped there till we reached London.  In the same compartment was an elderly gentleman who had spent many years in New South Wales & was a great sportsman.  We yarned the whole way up.  The old chap still thinks there is no place like "Aussie" & he is going back after the war.  He has the greatest admiration for the A.I.F. troops & their record. I left Charlie at London, he went out to Brixton & I to Paddington to put my things in the parcel office till the train left that night, its no use carrying them around with you in London.
