[Handwritten page of notes relevant to AE1's disappearance]
She disappeared in St George's Channel between Islands of New Britain and New Ireland between 2 4 pm Some theories as to her fate:-
1. Motor trouble. One of her main electric motors being out of repair she dived slightly overtrimmed- that is had not buoyancy enough with her one remaining motor to give complete control finally she became unmanageable sank.
11. An old enemy Tug boat was found beached, having been set on fire by her crew who had decamped. This tugboat had on board a Nordenfell gun 5 barrel which may have been used unexpectedly by some one in hiding as the AE1 lay on the surface nearby.
111. Enemy Mines This theory is hardly probable because there were no harbours which had not been thoroughly swept searched.
The cause of her disappearance is still a mystery. She was out in company with the "Destroyer Parramatta" this boat left her to go down the chanel for another 25 miles. When the "Parramatta" had returned no trace of AE1 . They thought she had returned to harbour. However as no trace of her cld. be found a full search was made by all the available boats but without success.
Diligent stringent cross examination of the natives nearby by the Commander of H.M.S. "Encounter" reached no satisfaction.
