<p>fall out &amp; were dismissed. Have no idea why it was done but as it has turned out a very wet night &amp; I have rather a bad cold am rather glad allthough it means going through the whole performance again next week</p>
<p>Wednesday 10th<br/>Was transferred to A Co as they send the next draft. Put in all day <strike>doing it</strike> going there It took us quite half an hour</p>
<p>Thursday 11<br/>Usual Parades but as there was a good deal of rain put in most of our time in the shelter sheds. This is the first decent rain for some time &amp; it was badly needed The wheat crops about here are very good not very high but big well filled heads<br/>Applications were called for a Machine Gun school so put in am not very keen on it but it seems about the only way to get another 4 days leave &amp; I am keen on that</p>
