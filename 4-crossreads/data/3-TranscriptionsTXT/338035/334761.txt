 It was surprising the distances the native fishing boats &amp; smacks went out to sea.  Then we were in for  the  what might easily be the surprise of the voyage and it took some time to convince us that same was true. Sam first brought the news that the O.C. Troops (Col. Holborrow) had awaken Capt. Vicars and informed that as there was trouble in Red Sea "we were going round the b&mdash;Cape".  The ship was still travelling  east  west (towards Suez) but this was explained by the fact that the Captain did not wish the Colombo people to see what direction we  were  would go in and he would alter his course later.  This proved correct and at 5 p.m. we altered our course due south and we are surely due for South Africa.  If that is so we are  surely  in for a very big sea trip and even now some of those on board are looking cross-eyed at water. 
 Tuesday 23rd Still continue journey due south which confirmed our fears for a trip to Sth. Africa. For the period ended noon we did 238 miles. Issued with lime juice today. 
 Wednesday 24th (Empire Day) Did not recognise that it was Empire Day except at night when a patriotic concert was held. Still continue to travel South &amp; covered 259 miles for 24 hours.
