<p>I have tea &amp; dinner each night with Dolly have seen nothing of Laura or Charlie's wife- but I may see them later on.<br/>I've got a dose of Bronchitis but nothing bad.<br/>Hear all officers in England L H or any other are sent to the Infantry in France.<br/>I am wondering how I would stand the Winter there, its rather a shame to lose Seniority in your own crowd besides having no Kit in England.<br/>However one will see &amp; its no use meeting the Devil half way- Cols Ryan &amp; Mandesley are I am glad to say the Doctors I shall come before.</p>
