Being without news from you and our children is my great trouble.
Hardships dont matter much.Have chapters to write to you and dear Mother soon as spare time comesNow none of you must be anxious about me for my eleventh hour luck is still a mercy which a good providence extends.Many soldiers have strong faith in simple charms they carry and by them they come through.
