<p>got the 'wind up', even traffic police must carry rifles &amp; ammunition.  Up the line at Passchendaele I was on a wiring party in No Man's Land &amp; the only protection we had was one pair of wire cutters between 20 men!  Now we fall in with rifle &amp; bayonet, 120 rounds, a tin of bully &amp; two biscuits.  We then move to a dump for picks &amp; shovels, thence to the allotted task.  If digging a trench you will inevitably be up to your knees in water before you are deep enough.  The ground is frozen hard for 8 or 9 inches, &amp; of course shell holes several feet deep are full of water &amp; drain into the trenches.  One wonders how so few go down with pneumonia etc.  We have to work from 1600 to 2200 so that Fritz cannot observe our movements &amp; when we finish for the night we throw snow over the freshly turned earth.</p>
