 Gran will send to you a letter I wrote to her describing our last trek to Helouan from which we have just come back a few days ago. Will you send her the last long letter I wrote you.

 I will close this now darlings & "iggory" to bed. That word is Arabic for hurry, or run, & "imshi" means go, or clear out. These were the two words used (with a few choice adjectives) by our troops, when they charged the Turks.
