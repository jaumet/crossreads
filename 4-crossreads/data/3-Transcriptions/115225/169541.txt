<p>Esq &amp; Ban were examined for the Flying corps (preliminary medical exam only).</p>
<p>Mar 19th We went out on roads working from Bailleul. We parked in Place Plicton for dinner from 11 A.M. till 1.30 P.M.. Fritz was shelling just down the hill from us from 11.30 till 1.30pm but did little damage. Raining all day.</p>
<p>Mar 20th Still raining &amp; foggy all morning but it cleared up in the afternoon. We didn&#39;t go out to-day. I went up to Suzannes on my pat in the afternoon to wile away an hour. We expect to hand in our Daimler lorries &amp; have peerless lorries instead.</p>
<p>Mar 21st We had to take all our kits out of the lorries &amp; take the lorries up to 1st A.C.P.-S.C &amp; hand them over, fortunately the weather was fine for the job. We slept in an old hut for the night.&nbsp; Fritz is still shelling Bailleul. Wherever we are we can hear the report of the gun. Then for a few seconds silence then almost over head a crack or report which sounds the same as one of our guns not far away, then the shell travelling makes a frightful noise all the ay to Bailleul. We then hear the explosion we have had arguments about the queer way the shells go but we can&#39;t get any light</p>
