<p>January 1918<br/>Wednesday 16</p>
<p>At Beutin<br/>Went out for lamp practice this morning i/c of Bdr Palmer.<br/>A very pleasant day, not too much snow, or frost. Had a letter from old Len Clements, who is in Blighty. He is on furlough and is having the usual &ndash; furlough time. <br/>Received further news of Roys wounds. He is progressing favourably, and walks with the aid of a crutch. <br/>Old Bill Brom, wrote some very nice letters which I answered.</p>
