<p>Friday, 9 July, 1915<br/>Made poor speed all day as the Capt wanted to arrive at Alex in the morning, I am very anxious to get back again as I expect my two brothers here any day, &amp; moreover there is a big mail awaiting me otherwise I would never want to go near Egypt.  Finished all our wound dressings by 2-30 to-day, we have got a quick system now, this has been an interesting trip for me &amp; I have gained some good practical knowledge.  Every day we hear rumours that Achi Baba has fallen &amp; that the road to Kilid Bahr opened but they are only soldier's dreams.</p>
<p>Arrived outside Alexandria late at night.</p>
<p>Saturday, 10 July, 1915<br/>We did not go inside until after breakfast we had packed up most of the operating gear when the Col rushed down telling us not to pack as we had to go to Malta, only the typhoid &amp; enteric fever patients and the officers went off here.  The Lascar crew went on strike to be paid off as their time was up, after a long argument they finally got paid but agreed to come back &amp; take us to Malta, by the time we sailed at six they were all on but 13 however we sailed without them.  We received mail &amp; pay to-day the mail is the latest from Aust, so there are two ahead of us missing.  My brothers left Melb on the Ajana, so they ought to be here now.</p>
