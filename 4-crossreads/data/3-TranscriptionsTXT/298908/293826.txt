"flu" & again that one of the boats had been torpedoed with great loss of life.Great news this morning, both Turkey & Austria seem to be finished for good, theres no doubt the war is nearly over.  We are beginning to wonder if they will send us off now or not, or send us back to our units & send the lot home together.I heard yesterday that Len & all his mob are held up in Cairo.  I wonder if its true if so I rather envy him for Cairo is a lovely place to visit.One of our lads has got one of the origional pipes of the 4th Battalion & the boys amuse themselves by strutting up & down trying to blow the pipes.  You should hear the crazy noises they produce it's the fun of the world, pipes are all very well when played by an expert at a distance but when a mug gets hold of them at close quarters well the result is better imagined than described, puts me in mind of 20 cats fighting & screaming together with the howls of a dog thrown in for balance.
