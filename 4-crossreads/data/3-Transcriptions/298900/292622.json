<p>&amp; had a cup of hot tea before getting on to the train, the usual mixture of 3rd class carriages &amp; trucks minus doors windows etc there not being sufficient time to repair them.    Set off out 6 A.M. &amp; after a tedious trip reached the Dekemabeek siding in Belguim near Kemmel at 12 P.M. MIDDAY.   There the Y.M.C.A. had a cup of hot Cocoa awaiting us &amp; we marched a short distance to Rossignol Camp where we spent the night.   Had a wash &amp; brush up &amp; walked to the M.D.S. at night to see the place we were taking over.  Had a good yarn to old members of the 2nd Field Amb.   Returned to camp &amp; turned in about 9 P.M. feeling tired but could not sleep much owing to the cold, the weather having changed a lot.</p>
<p>Wednesday 30th Jan<br/>   Up at 8 A.M. after a rough night, it being very cold.   Had breakfast &amp; then walked out to the A.D.S. at Wijtschaete.   This is supposed to be one of the best in France, being constructed by a company of Engineers</p>
