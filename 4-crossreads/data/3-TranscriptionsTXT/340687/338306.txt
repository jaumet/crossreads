January, 1917. Tuesday 2Usual routine until after dinner when I repaired to Bernafoy for a load of wood and chopped it before going out at 4.30. Received 8 letters all very interesting. There has been heavy shelling on both sides since yesterday and our duck walk was torn up in numerous places and Fritz also blew up many portions of the Decauville track especially near Longueval and also the R.E. dump at Flers. Night cloudy and windy but mild and no rain. Worked very strenuously and got down to 10'. &amp; felt tired on arrival home. Waited up for Ingram who came in an hour later and after tea &amp; some bread &amp; jam soon went to sleep.
