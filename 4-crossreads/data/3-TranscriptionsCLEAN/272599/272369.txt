1917 Sunday 8 April
Easter Sunday!!  Last Easter Day we landed at Suez.   What a life-time has been crowded into the last 12 months?   New experiences- fresh outlooks.   Will we see the expiration of another 12 months before this unfortunate business is ended.Fatique duty during day.McBurney & self go for walk after tea to ruins of Martinpuich.   Such a scene of desolation?   Everything splintered to matchwood.   Souvenirs - The old Tank & knockout blow on the forehead.   Secure face of its brass clock.   Long dead Fritzs & Tommies lying about.   'Twas in Sept. last this area was taken.   A beautiful sunny bright day   Symbolical of the day.
