<p>April 1915<br/>Sunday 18<br/>Our section had to mount guard at 9.30 AM. Church Parade <u>C. of E.</u>. Weather dull but very calm. Projected boat trip to Queen Elizabeth with our Platoon Commander (Lieut Dawson) abandoned</p>
<p>Monday 19<br/>Beautiful fine weather. Scarcely a ripple on the water. Had a good swim overboard. Water lovely. Another Aust Mail in. Had a grand little tour around the Queen Elizabeth &amp; other warships. We went on board the Prince of Wales &amp; were shown the works of the 12" guns. The charge is fired by a small cap or cartridge. A sailor put one in &amp; I fired it.   The sailors on the ships are real sports and very obliging</p>
