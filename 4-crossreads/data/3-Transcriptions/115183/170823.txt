The wounded were mostly collected to Ploegsteert &ndash; Messines Road and brought back along it by the Field Ambulance SB's some on wheels,a nd some by carrying. The road was shelled a little but not much. The enemy had evidently relied upon gas shells to smother the attack. During the nights of 7th and th June he sent them over in tremendous numbers.</p>
<p>The next three days the 9th, 10th, and 11th  I spent on the same work but not at the same pressure. The next day 12th June 1917 we were relieved at the ADS by the New Zealanders and returned to Charing Cross. From here the cars took us a tired irritable lot back to the CMDS at Pont D'Achelles. Here we had dinner and a rest before moving on. There was a YMCA stall here dispensing free drinks and biscuits. I sent a note home thro the YMCA. I must not pass on without mentioning the fine work of the YMCA</p>
