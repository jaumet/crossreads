 My very dear Father, 
 It was a very pleasant & welcome surprise to-day to receive your long and interesting letter of 21st ult. I was glad to hear that Mother & yourself were able to enjoy the visit to Bundanoon. It is very good of you both to send me the extra fountain-pen, but really Father you should not have worried about it and  the glasses. I have my other pair (which I always kept in reserve) so was not really stuck - I should have been more thoughtful in writing and mentioned that . 
 However I appreciate very much your love in sending the glasses. If I return them you will not misunderstand my doing so, I'm sure. While I think of it - I forgot in my last to say how acceptable your present of those sovereigns proved. 
 The voyage was much longer than I expected and there were several   unlooked  unforeseen expenses to meet so your gift was more than acceptable. 
 I should be glad if you will let Uncle Gus have my *diary p.p. to look through and ask him to please pass them on to C.O.L. for his perusal - the latter can let you have them at his leisure. I shall not have nearly the time for correspondence that was available at DL. so must concentrate 
 *except perhaps p.8 after all comparisons are odious.
