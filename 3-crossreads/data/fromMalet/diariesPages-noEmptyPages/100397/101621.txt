That is nearly the sum total of my news this time. I will soon have to catch a London bound train, as I have to draw my equipment out of store 'tween five 6 a.m. tomorrow, so I will have to switch off. it's 11 P.M. now and I catch a train before 12 p.
so heaps of Love to all especially yourself and Bet. from your Loving Son Chas.
I hope that the flowerseeds grow. The Poppies should.
