<p>Rumor has it that a message has been intercepted &amp; that they &ndash; the German boats &ndash; have a rendezvous at a Known point with some colliers &amp; our ships are going to rendezvous at the same part  -  Wont the sparks fly if that rendezvous comes off?</p>
<p><u>Our</u> job of work is to wait in Rabaul harbor &ndash; AE2 &amp; the Destroyers are to guard the harbor  -  A period of waiting is at hand  -  I don't mind  -  I am also told they want a P.M.O. for these parts  -  I must look up that job &amp; find out <u>what the perks</u> are  -  Would it be worth while<u>?</u></p>
<p>Thursday Sept 22  - 14<br/>Yes &ndash; Things are as I said  -  The Berrima troop ship went out early  -  The Frenchman Montcalm has gone  -  The admirals are <u>reported</u> to have met &amp; arranged things mutually  -  The harbor looks quite empty  -  The Aorangi &amp; Grantala come up to the Pier on W-day morning  -  Personally I am astonished at the Grantala coming up because I understood that the less she came into contact with the shore the better  -  They've been here 10 days &amp; not a landing party has gone off from her  -</p>
