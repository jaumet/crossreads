<p>This one gave me a bit of a shock.  I just heard the signal SOS.YVO.  Lands End the other stn which at present is doing nothing but distress &amp; shipping work heard the same signal.  As the stn in distress sent no further ptclrs for a few minutes Lands End asked, "Who called SOS pls.  Give postn."  The stn answered immediately repeating his call signal YVO &amp; giving his position, which was about 30 miles behind the other two.  Lands End signalled "OK.  Will attend to it.  Are you being chased by sub?  What is the name of your ship?"  At 6.44pm 9 minutes after the first signal for help was made he signalled "Bollington Grange.  Sub sighted mile away now lost sight of it.  Destroyers here".  An admiralty warning was sent out half an hour after the first call giving full particulars of position where sub sighted.</p>
