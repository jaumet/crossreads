Our First Anniversary. A French officer met us all at the station and conducted us to our billet. We have about a dozen huts for our Amb. They are built in a nice little paddock next to the kiddies school, and quite near a Church. There is a pond close by, which supplies us with water for washing, but it is not good drinking water. We are only a few miles from the firing line, and can hear the big guns quite distinctly. It did not take us long to unroll our blankets and get to sleep, as we had been nearly 3 days on the train, and had very little sleep. We woke up again about 11, and after a drink of tea and a snack we were told off in a fatigue parties to square up the camp, and build latrines, etc., Mac Dougall and I were told off as S.P. again, so the game is still good. We got leave when the work was done, and wandered around the village. It is only a small place, but every little thing about it is historical. The French people are most obliging, nothing is too much trouble to them. It is very nice to talk to those who can speak English, as the French accent makes one dry old lingo which sounds quite pleasant. The town is full of soldiers, Aust. N.Zealanders, Tommies, Scotchmen, in their kilts, in fact, all sorts, but they are all very well behaved. Everything is very cheap,, we only have to pay about a penny here, for what those sobbing Egyptians would charge 6d. A party of us went around the place and spent a most enjoyable evening. There were 6 of us in the party and it seemed strange to be able to "shout" for the lot with only 6 pence. There are a big number of wine and beer shops about, which did good business, but I've only seen 1 man drunk. They don't have to pay for licences and anyone can open a shop, the only restriction being a matter of hours. They are allowed to open from 11 till 1 and from 6 till 8 in the evening.
