<p>Saturday 17th Aug. '18</p>
<p>Made up for loss of sleep by staying in till nearly dinner time, when Freddy Cocks came round to see what had become of me. There had been a parade at 9 oclock, but no roll had been called, so nothing <strike>would</strike> was said. In any case they could hardly have taken exception to such a thing on the first morning after a very strenuous fortnight.</p>
<p>I am in a new bivouac (which is more of a dug-out &amp; a good one at that) tonight, having got it from a vacating horse-transport man, who had to be nearer his horses. Freddy Cocks will probably be in with me tomorrow. There is plenty of room for two. It is dug about 3 feet into the earth, is walled &amp; roofed with planks &amp; earth, &amp; has a nice entrance &amp; two steps. I can almost stand upright in it. If I only had a table</p>
