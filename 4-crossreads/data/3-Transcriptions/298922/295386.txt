<p>Thursday 1 March 1917</p>
<p>Am posting you a "VIVE PARISIENNE" paper you will perhaps smile at some of the Broad Jokes but this is the paper the SOLDIERS all buy in France &amp; here &amp; is the best French lesson possible.</p>
<p>Did Patrols today &amp; 2 Lectures on Dismounted Attacks such as through the scrub on Gallipoli &ndash; war news better &ndash; my notes will be useful for future reference.</p>
<p>Went to Remount Depot to see Col. McLeish but he was out. Heliopolis is very deserted now. Glorious weather and neck alright.</p>
