    For entrance we paid 6d to a Red Cross fund, then purchased a catalogue and were le a d by the housekeeper quite a responsible lady, through certain rooms, galleries and passages where priceless Old Masters and valuable furniture were shown us. 
    These pictures comprise one of the most valuable collections (private) in Great Britain, one picture alone - Holbein's Erasmus having been refused sale lately at 30,000.  There are several by Rubens, Tenier, Van Dyck and others of the Flemish School, including some by Ruysdall, whose forests so dark and gloomy have always been favourites of mine. 
    Another one that pleased me was a Velasquez, a portrait of his servant, another Spanish picture was Murillo's, Italian Pictures only a few, though there were many family portraits by Reynolds, Gainsborough and lesser known of the English portrait painters.  There was a beauty believed to be a Rembrandt, and it looked line one too.  One hour in these corridors, galleries and rooms, why I could have spent a day. 
    Then we looked through noble windows at the formal garden, terraced sunken and in the Italian style, it was very beautiful and I took a snapshot. 
    An object of much interest was Imperial Steel Chair, the metal work is marvellously intricate and elaborate and in 130 different sections, represents events of Roman history; the chair has a lengthy history commencing with its seizure at the sacking of Prague, by a Swedish gentleman.
