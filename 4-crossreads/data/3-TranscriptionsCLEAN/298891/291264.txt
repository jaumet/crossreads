 Arose & took my luggage to Wilton hotel. Then reported at 66 Victoria St. & Lindsay, Russell & I went to B. Red.C. to find that we cd. not get passport until Monday. Back to hotel. Had dinner & rested & at night Jean Lindsay & I went to "A Little Bit of Fluff" at Criterion & oh my, the crush coming home on the Underground took us an hour from Piccadilly to Victoria. Cold & grey.
