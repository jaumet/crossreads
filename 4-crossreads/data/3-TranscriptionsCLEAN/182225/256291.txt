JUNE   WEDNESDAY 21   1916
A cloudy day, but very warm & muggy. The 27th Bat was on duty and I was detailed off in the "ship's stores" fatigue. Bill Hunter & Self were down the hold getting things out, & sending them up in the sling. Had to go into the cold storage room & get meat out.
The A8 had a couple of shots with her gun at a cask at 1100 yards range & got 2 hits  HMS Kent had about 50 or more shots at targets astern of her & did some fair shooting  Was watching her through the glasses. We were all paid 15/- in the afternoon. The "Marathon" caught us up again in the afternoon after being some miles behind for a couple of days.
Days run to 12 pm
280 miles
