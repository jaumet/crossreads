Wednesday 20th February 1917 [1918]1/2 day & went zoological gardens for 1st time and very pretty it was with the pond covered with duck, pelicans fishing, shadows & reflections everywhere.Dull day (3rd of its kind) with showers at intervals.  S. Steele with me 'till 6 p.m. then tea at Y.W.C.A. at Pt. 31/2, then Aust. soldiers club, Boulac Street where I superintended tea & coffee & biscuits, such nice boys all - one Wright from Hamilton, Vic., having his boots cleaned in the street "because the poor beggar had both legs off".  Mr. Gerard Nutting brought me home 11.30 p.m. (T'mba boy).  Major Hammond & Capt. very friendly - Canon Garland most grateful for help etc.  Brave Anzac boys there & all so simple & quiet about it all.
