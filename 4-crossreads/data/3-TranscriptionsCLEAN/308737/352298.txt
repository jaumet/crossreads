 Darling Mum Nance & Joan At last I'm writing you a short note from the firing line, or at least I'm now seated in my dug-out, & just had tea. So far I hav'nt been roughly handled by our esteemed foe, except for a [indecipherable] spent bullet which smacked me on the hip, weeks ago & hardly left a bruise. I often see Charlie Bean & have a chat & afternoon tea with him. He is awfully good to me & never lets me go without anything. I never go down to see him without coming away with tin-milk, cigarettes, socks or something. I have not seen Jack yet although he is back again in the firing line. I saw Keith Eltham a few weeks ago he is in good nick. He's in the artillery.
