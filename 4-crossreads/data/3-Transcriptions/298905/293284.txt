<p>I nearly had my light put out last night, it happened this way just as we were coming round the corner on the way to our billet, 3 great German shells fell fair in the town &amp; one of them lobbed right into a big stone house, talk about a frightful din &amp; a blinding flash of flame as this great shell exploded the concussion from it knocked myself &amp; a few more who were with me off our feet, &amp; as I was falling a piece of tile or something hit my steel helmet with a tremendous bang &amp; nearly stunned me, I should certainly have had my brains knocked out if I had not been wearing my helmet, it saved my life alright.<br/>Had a church parade this morning held under the shade of some</p>
