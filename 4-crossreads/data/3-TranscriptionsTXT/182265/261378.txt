8th Oct Very wet miserable day. The ground is frightfully sloppy. I visited Ypres today & saw Lts Nugent & D'Arcy-Irvine near Lille Gate. Had pleasant afternoon tea with them and invited them to tea with me tomorrow evening. I arranged with 1st Bn. Pioneers to allow their men (Nugent & Irvine) as well as my own to have a hot shower bath tomorrow afternoon. Got wet through coming home. Have just issued rum ration & am going to bed to read "Bulletin" of 12 July before going to sleep. Tremendous cannonading on up north all last night & this morning. Met Sid Lloyd (57th Bn) in Ypres going into the line.
Requisitioned extra socks & some new boots for my men on account of wet weather & heavy wear.
