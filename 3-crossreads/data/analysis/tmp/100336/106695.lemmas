 The first part of the climb was the most danger so we lower our gear down on a rope and then we got down ourselv . After the first hundr feet it was not so bad There were two wild goat which scamper away at our approach . They must have wonder what we were for I am sure no man had ever approach the Tarsus River that difficult and danger way befor . Howev we got down to the water edg without serious mishap . We found it to be a veri fast flow stream about 30 yard wide and look to be about 4[to ? ] 6 deep . We were doubt whether we could cross it as it was flow so swift . Direct opposit where we were the rock inclin slight from the bed of the creek to the top we reckon on be abl to climb up . Direct abov and below this cross place the stream ran between sheer wall of rock 2 to 300 feet high . If we miss our foot cross , we would be wash down with littl chanc of ever get out . Howev we decid to spend the day here and cross in the even . We were well conceal so we lit a small fire , boil a littl water and made oxo. This was inde grand after have noth but biscuit for the last 3 day and littl of that . After we finish our meal we went in for a bath to freshen ourselv up , for we had not had a wash sinc we left . Afterward we lay down in the shade and had a good sleep. About 4 p.m. we prepar to cross one of us just manag to pick our way across .

Just befor dusk we start on our peril climbin up the opposit side which we manag without accid . We start off on our cours after travel about two mile over rough countri we came to anoth precipic with the river flow far below . This was veri dishearten . We came to the conclus that this must be the same stream that we had cross but turn back in a bend through the mountain , so we turn off to the right to avoid it . Here the travel becam veri difficult , thick prick bush , and huge rock . To make thing wors we came on to a villag and all the dog in the place start bark so we had to pick our way care round this villag . After we had gone anoth mile still terribl rough we were just about decid to lay down and sleep till daylight when we came on to a narrow track run in the direct we want to go so we decid to follow this . We had gone about 5 mile when we came on to a small stream . There was an old broken down stone bridg so we cross over and befor leav refil our water bottl . Just as we start off we could hear a Turk come in the distanc , sing , as they alway do at night , so we had to hide till he pass . After we had gone anoth two mile we came out to fair clear countri and
