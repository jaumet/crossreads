 Sunday 6 February 1916 Church parade. Committee Meeting to arrange about Sports, etc. Col. Fuller &amp;amp; Brig. to Helouan to inspect site which is situated just behind The Twific Hotel.  The Town is a very quiet place &amp;amp; one wonders why such Palaces are erected.  The Gardens surrounding the Building are Beautifully laid out &amp;amp; every comfort is forthcoming to those who have the Cash. 
 Monday 7 February 1916 Clearing up for Brigade inspection. I went into Cairo with 'Hegarty' by Train.  Brunker took the two Horses by road. Arranged for accomadation for Horses &amp;amp; men. Brought back 1 Case Whisky &amp;amp; Beer for Mess. The Racing Stables are small but clean &amp;amp; the Horses will indulge in a cosy Home for a few Days.  The men in Charge of them are untrustworthy being too fond of Liquor. 
 Tuesday 8 February 1916 Brigade marched to Heloun leaving camp at 2 p.m. I went into Cairo to see Horses &amp;amp; returned by train to Heloun with Col. Fuller's Suit Case.  He had dinner at Tewfic Hotel (Palace).  Concert at night at Hotel in Grounds. A number of Ladies assisted.  The men sat around on the Grass whilst the verandah made a good platform.  The Brigadier was in good form &amp;amp; appeared to enjoy Himself immensely though I do not think He would ever make a successfull artist. 
 Wednesday 9 February 1916 Packed Valise &amp;amp; left by train for Maadi.  Col. Fuller had Breakfast at Tewfic Hotel &amp;amp; then brought regiment into Camp.  The Brigade left at 8 a.m. from Helouan arriving in Camp at 12-30 p.m. (noon). I went into Cairo by afternoon Train to see Horses &amp;amp; returned at 10 p.m. with 2 Cases Beer for Mess. The Horses appeared to be neglected &amp;amp; I found the men in Charge drunk.
