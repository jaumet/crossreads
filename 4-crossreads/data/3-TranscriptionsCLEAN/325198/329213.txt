2 January, 1916"Caledonia" got into Alex on Sunday & disembarked on Monday morning & entrained right away for Heliopolis. I put in two days at this camp then came back to Maadi & joined up with my Regt I got back into my old A troop again.  Received a bundle of 29 letters & a parcel from Bill [Fender?] & found my kit bag & it was fairly intact containing my two pairs of boots & a pair of leggings. The boys have been drinking up well & are making up for the time spent on the peninsular -  It is not bad to have a free [leg?] for a while.
