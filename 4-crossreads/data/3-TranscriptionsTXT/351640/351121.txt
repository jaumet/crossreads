After a time I descended, paid a visit on donkey-back to the Sphynx, & soon afterwards found the other officers seated at the eating house opposite the entrance to Mena Hospital. Just imagine my disgust when told that not one of them had reached more than one third way up the pyramid; but they heard me speak & from the point which they had gained the camera was sited upon me; the plates are being developed. Owing to the dim light and its distance there is but faint hope of securing a picture.
In a former letter I told you details of my first ascent of Kephren. You may remember that one can reach the casing wearing ordinary boots; there one has to leave his hard foot covering and to go bear bare or with socks, this I did again wearing the thick by coloured pair of knitted sox that you Joseph dear made. They were just the thing protecting my feet from the hard and sharp pieces of stone which might have bruised or cut my unprotected skin. IfA picture of a white man on the summit of the pyramid Kephren would be unique, & it could only be taken successfully from the top of Cheops. If I can get another man to do his part I shall make the climb again. I hardly think a photograph of the kind is in existance.
Dr Henry ([f]rom Grafton) is something of a litterary man. He has sent an account of my climbing to the Grafton paper, & and I have written to Mr Varley of Norwich Chambers, Hunter St., Sydney, who owns the paper, to send to you a copy of the issue wherein the notes may be published. Henry writes well. He did not show me the matter before sending it on. Keep it for me or
