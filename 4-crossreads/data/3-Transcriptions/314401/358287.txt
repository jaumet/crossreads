<p>being  touched a bit. To lie between blankets in the tropics when Sun hit best is not an experience that one is likely to want again. However I am quite alright again in every way, appetite good, limbs sound, heart beating true. Revenons nos moutons! We left Suva, after coaling at 8 a.m. on Aug. 27th, with our bows turned towards Samoa. We look quite impressive. The Psyche is leading three miles ahead. Abreast of us is the Montcalm. Then in double row come Melbourne, two transports with the Pyramus and Philomel. It is very rough for the South East trade wind blowing steadily has roughened the sea pretty considerably; the transports seem to pitch &amp; roll a lot &amp; I expect the soldiers are feeling very sorry for themselves. Nothing happens to spoil or mar the monotony of the trip until the mountains of Samoa loom up above the horizon. One has often read of the lovely South Sea islands, &amp; here they are under our lee in all their glory. We are at Apia now, sacred to the memory of Robert Louis Stevenson, &amp; also by the escape of the Calliope in the terrible typhoon of 1889. It is a lovely Sunday morning Aug 30 eight o'clock &amp; all is perfectly sweet &amp; still and the town looks so pretty. The place may be fortified &amp; the harbour mined for all we know, so two piquet boats are sent ahead to sweep the channel for mines. When they find it is quite safe, the Pyramus is sent close in , flying a flag of truce, the White flag, from the yardarm. She bears an ultimatum from the Admiral to the governor demanding unconditional Surrender within half an hour, any request for conditions to be treated as an answer in the negative. The governor is away in the interior, a mere device to gain time, and his subordinate replies to the effect that he is not authorised to surrender, but will offer no resistance to the landing of our troops. They are quickly landed, the German flag is hauled down in the presence of Admiral Huguet, &amp; the   <strike>Pyramus</strike> Psyche fires a salute of 21 guns as the good old Union Jack is unfurled to the breeze. There is nothing left for us to do; we can gain no information about the German fleet, which has not been in this neighbourhood for many months. Accordingly, at noon on Monday Aug. 31, we start for Fiji, Montcalm goes on her own, &amp; Pyramus, Psyche &amp; Philomel return to New Zealand. </p>
