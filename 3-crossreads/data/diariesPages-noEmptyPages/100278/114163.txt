whole 3 hours.
The following is the way we cut the morning out, the first 15 minutes is spent in Company drill then we are formed up and the platoons march off indepentenly for physical exercise,  an hour is spent at this and the Sergts have to instruct, then fall in again and march off for bayonet fighting, rifle drill, squad drill, platoon drill, musketry instruction and sometimes "open order work" all of which the Sergeants have to instruct so you can see we have to know our work.
Sometimes they send a young NCO out and he has to drill the men under your supervision, and all while officers are looking on and watching for mistakes, about  of an hour before our time is up we are formed up again and finish off with Coy drill and then march home.
