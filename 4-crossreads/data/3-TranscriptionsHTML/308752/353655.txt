<p>at mid-night. Arras was passed about 3 a.m. Three hot meals were provided the following day &amp; at 8.30 p.m. we arrived at our detraining point. The march to Harfleure Camp was a severe one, &amp; the road was inches thick with mud. Luckily we did not carry our blankets, as they were all collected before leaving the train. By the time the camp was reached every one was in a bad humour, and the long wait for a cup of tea (without milk or sugar) did not help to improve matters. All turned in at 1 a.m. and the following morning another wild rush took place for breakfast.  After this "sumptuous meal" all web equipment was handed in, &amp; I was not sorry to see the last of my pack.

On leaving the lorries we embarked immediately &amp; at 7 p.m. we started on the journey across the Channel. The weather was calm, but never-the-less there were a great number sea-sick on board.  As before I was a good sailor.  At 5 a.m. the following day, we were anchored in the harbour at Weymouth. A couple of hours later the 14th Quota were sitted in a buffet, enjoying a cup of "Dinkum" tea.  English ladies waited on the men. The railway station was only about a mile away, and very soon all were in the train, not cattle trucks this time, but, comfortable clean carriages.
