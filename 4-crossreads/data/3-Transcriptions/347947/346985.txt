<p>we were playing cards for cigarettes what we get for presents during the day.  I broke the school winning them all about 500 cigarettes altogether.  It was a very wet Christmas and cold raining for days  I stayed here till Wed 19th Jan 1916 during which time I visited London once and Croydon occasionally, and back again in the evening and on the 19th was discharged from hospital, after being five months in different Hospitals, after our discharge, for there were several of us, we were driven from Addington Hospital in red cross ambulances to Croyden station, where we caught a train to London.  Got out at a large station named Victoria a very busy part of London and proceeded to our head offices in Horseferry Rd. reached</p>
