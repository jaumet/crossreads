<p>26th Captain Asher and myself left St LEGER for the headquarters 4th Division to attend a meeting of Trench Mortar Officers. The expert Trench Mortar Officer of the 4th Army was there and tried to give us information which would be useful.</p>
<p>27th The 12th and 13th Infantry Brigades move out to the line. Had a row with Captain Asher, he tries to treat me as a clerk, he is really annoyed that I know more about the job than he does.</p>
