<p>are going to be withdrawn shortly &amp; sent to England with the object of refitting &amp; going to France. I hope so but would like to see this affair concluded first. Perhaps it means that the end is in sight. I would like to think so but it seems to me that there is a lot to do yet. While swimming near the wharf I had my name taken by the Military Police. My offence was approching too close to the Pier. I expect that I will hear more later.</p>
<p>Saturday 10th  Windy &amp; dusty once more. Orders out making the village &amp; ships in harbour out of bounds. Some of the hoodlums go out &amp; buy spirits etc &amp; come home drunk considering themselves dead smart. There was also a mild kind of riot in the village. 'Tis the same old tale of a few spoiling things for all. The "Aquitania" came in this morning loaded with troops. She makes all others, Battleships included, appear toys.</p>
<p>Sunday 11th Warm &amp; dusty. Went to church service at night &amp; listened to a first class address. Singing was poor, there was no-one to give a lead. Heard a rumour that 'Metz' was taken by French.</p>
<p>Monday 12th Still hot &amp; dusty. A mail arrived addressed to C/o Capt Stacey &amp; was taken in charge by our Sergeant who refused point blank to open it until our officers returned. The crowd acquiesced but I went &amp; interviewed the Capt with the result he ordered the bag to be opened &amp; sorted immediately. Joy everywhere, it proved</p>
