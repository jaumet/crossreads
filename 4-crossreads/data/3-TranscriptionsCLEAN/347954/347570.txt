  
 friend shrapnel worries us occasionally & oft times wings or kills a number of our unit but still in comparison it is very mild.  We have another worry which tends towards irritation these hot days - our regular C.O. is superseded by a bright young member of the medical fraternity whose one fault is spontaneous out bursts of energy.  A shrapnel swept patch of countryside almost square & flat, has suggested to his energetic mind an ideal parade ground & here daily some of we poor unfortunates are dragged to master the intricacies of form fours etc.  No doubt we should welcome this diversion but generally we don't & possibly when some unfortunate man is sacrificed the administeration will give orders for the closing of this particular playground. 
 30/6/15 Today is Wednesday, nothing much doing excepting a rather heavy ocean swell from the west & a very wild accompanying wind which appears to be doing great damage on the beach.  Barges, punts, & small craft are being flung on the pebbles & among the stores of the Army Service.  At intervals men are observed mooching along with pieces of boat & punt which comes in handy for fuel.  I am taking the opportunity of having a real surf - no sham -
