<p>France<br/>27.6.1916<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>This is my first letter from France so I have a fair amount to talk about of course but am afraid I must condense as one does not get a great deal of leisure in these parts.</p>
<p>We landed at Marseilles early in June &amp; entrained there straight away for Northern France. That 3 days train journey I shall never forget! The first day's run through Southern France was absolutely like Heaven after coming out of the sand. Everything of course is beautiful just now, green everywhere, &amp; the most beautiful shades imaginable. Every inch of the country</p>
