(26) Started raining early this morning making everything miserable again.
(27) Went into village of "Meulte" this afternoon with Sgt Alabaster to get some timber for proposed monument for our boys that fell at "Poziers".
(28) On the move again. Marched out from Shelter wood Camp at 7.30 this morning and passed through "Martinpuich", "Pozieres, Le-Sars and camped between "Warlencourt" and "Le-Barque". The roads are in very bad state owing to such heavy traffic, and are blown up in 3 places. Paid a visit to the Butte-de-Warlencourt this afternoon, it has been almost levelled off with the large number of shells that have been hurled at it from time to time. A large cross has been erected on top to the memory of Officers N.C.O,s men who fell in the attack on the "Butte" on Nov 6th 1916. The enemy had some powerful positions in Le Barque but he had to go.
29 30 Stormy weather again. Field Marshall Sir Douglas Haig and several other Army Corps Commanders including our old friend Gen Birdwood passed through our Camp this afternoon on their way to Bapuame.
