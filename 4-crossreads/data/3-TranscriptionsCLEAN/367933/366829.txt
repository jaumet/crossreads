A. Rickard EsqDear Mr. RickardI understand that the Millions Club has been looking after the interests of our returning soldiers in the way of sending various comforts to them during their period of quarantine. We are expecting a large number of the men of 1st. L.H. Regt to arrive within the next fortnight, and we are anxious to send, if possible, daily supplies of smokes and fruit to them at North Head.
May I ask if we may look to your organisation for help in the matter of transport and if so what is the method of procedure.
I scarcely like troubling you as i know you are very busy but i know too how interested you are in the welfare of Australian soldiers. I shall be most grateful for any information you may be able to give meYours faithfullyHon.Sec. 1st L.H.C.F.
