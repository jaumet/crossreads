Tasmania and parts of Australia- the future generations will reap the advantage of our forced labour.
The distance by this narrow gauge railway between (vis from-to) these two broad gauges is about twelve miles. In the twelve miles there are twelve tunnels the longest being nearly three miles, (about twice the length of the Hawkesbury tunnel). The time usually taken for the journey is about two hours. (Most of the journey would naturally be underground through these tunnels.) At small For short intervals between them tunnels a traveller can see the line clinging precariously to the sides of the towering Taurus mountains. Through These intervals one gets disclose glimpses of majestic, inaccessible peaks, and frowning gauges gorges. Very little timber is seen and the peaks are almost as bare as Mount Owen on the west coast of Tasmania, whilst the scenery being is just as wild. The trees have been cut down and used for timbering up the tunnels and for fuel for the engines.
