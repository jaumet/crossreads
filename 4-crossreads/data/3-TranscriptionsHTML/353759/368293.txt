<p>6.<br/>Last night read St Ives, R.L. Stevenson.  Read last paragraph of Chapter XII and &ndash; "God save Ireland.!"</p>
<p>7.<br/>Before the "wash-out" tent was put up, one night Nicholson for the purpose got from the dispensary a per-chloride of Mercury tablet &ndash; and somehow or other, whoever gave it to him forgot to tell him how to use it. -  and he forgot to ask. He took it to his tent and asked the chap "Snow" what to do with it: Snow didn"t know and Nick wasn"t certain if it was to be used dissolved on a wash or taken internally: he decided on the last &ndash; and swallowed it. This was about 11.30 pm.</p>
<p>"You ---- fool!" says Snow, "do you know what you"ve done &ndash; you"ve swallowed poison!" Nick made one long dive to the nearest doctor"s tent. Since then he"s supposed to have sworn off women &ndash; he"ll have his work cut out &ndash; if he goes many times to Marseille.</p>

<p>Picket in the Wassah. &ndash; "Abide with Me" with "Lead thou me on" to follow.</p>
<p>Col. catches you in your tent during inspection, "Stand up stand up for Jesus".</p>
<p>Lecture by "Man who Knows." &ndash; about once a month on either "Venereal Disease" or Camp Hygiene or Flies and Latrines &ndash; "Tell me the Old Old story". Inspection by Gen. Howse - "When he cometh" &ndash; trouble is he never does.</p>
<p>9.<br/>In this morning"s orders &ndash;<br/>"All NCOs and men leaving the camp on duty or leave must do so properly dressed: in future waist belts must be worn.<br/>Said the W.O. in explanation and comment, so robbing the guards" fair name of its maidenhood "any man going through the gate will be sent back without his belt!"    !!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>10.<br/>Roachie has been disillusioned; one evening he "hooked" a girl in the village who proved herself square:  the next evening again she proved herself as Marguerite and Roachie began to laud her virtue over the camp: the third evening was exciting but after it he was more full than ever over having been the only man in the unit to meet a square girl.  Last night she of herself offered to lie with him for 5 Francs:  poor Jake:   "Lord what fools these mortals be."</p>

<p>13.<br/>Smithy drunk &ndash; I beg his pardon "giddy", tackles Home Rule".  The last time I was with him in Cairo the last memory of the night after the Egyptian Caf&eacute; was pulling the gharry driver up several times to tell him: "The moving finger writ etc., or some other appropriate words from man.  I woke up the next morning in Q.M. store on pile of mattresses.</p>
