Dear Sir,
I beg to submit a full account of my experiences covering 17 month imprisonment in eight different prison camps & working parties in Germany.
This account was written up whilst I was convalescing on my return to Australia & it contains full details of two escapes.
You will readily understand that it was impossible for me to keep any diary or memorand  because prisoners were frequently searched; but I have given a truthful record of my own experience as a prisoner of war.
I enlisted on July 12th 1915 at Adelaide (two of my brothers also enlisted there, the same week they were both killed in action the same day that I was taken prisoner)
I was a private in the 32nd Batt. - sailed from Pt. Adelaide Nov. 19th  1915, trained six months in Egypt (Canal Zone) then sent on to France.
In action at Frommelles took our objective but were eventually cut off & made a prisoner with about 300 others English & Australian soldiers.
