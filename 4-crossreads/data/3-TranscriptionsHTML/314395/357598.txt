<p>you have been very kind to her and the boy.  I am somewhat loth to speak on this subject, but still you have continually shown such marked sympathy &amp; kindness to them both that, although I am afraid thanks would offend you, I want you to know that I am very grateful and appreciate what you are doing.</p>
<p>I am still classed temporarily unfit but that might finish any day now.  I think I am getting all your letters although they take time, coming back from France.</p>
<p>Best wishes to yourself and Daphne.</p>
<p>Your affect. Son,<br/>George</p>
