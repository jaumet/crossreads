<p>July 1917<br/>friends.  We put in a couple of hours together &amp; talked Dorrigo for some time.  Also visited Mrs Warner &amp; had morning tea with her &amp; quite a long talk.  Promised to return another day. Went to see a friend of Arthur Gurney's at the Nazrich Hospital.  She is a VAD Nurse there &amp; is a nice girl.  We did not stay long as she was busy, but promised to return.  In the afternoon we had a bit of a sleep &amp; later got our passes altered to allow us to visit Alexandria.</p>
<p>We caught the 11.30 train Friday night &amp; got to Alex shortly after daylight Saturday morning &amp; went to the Windsor Hotel overlooking the sea.  Got in another couple of hours rest before breakfast &amp; after we went out to Chatby les Bains for a swim.  The water was very heavy &amp; the surf dangerous, so we didn't stay long in the water.  After our swim we called on Mrs Avgerinos &amp; promised to call again after dinner &amp; take the girls to the races.  We got a car &amp; had a nice drive out to the Sporting Clubs grounds &amp; had a great afternoon.  We picked  several winners</p>
