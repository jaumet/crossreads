 a nice change after the monotony of the desert.  I was most pleased to hear of Hilda &amp; Peter's engagement.  Did you hear of Brother Stuart's Military Cross.  He won it at Pozieres.  Since then he had the bad luck to be hit by a sniper just above the knee breaking the big bone.  I don't think he will walk again for some months.  My parson brother Arthur is now in France.  Bill Rose is now a Lance Corporal in my Troop.  He is in my tent now, talking a lot of rot &amp; reading a magazine.  I was sorry to hear of your chillblains, hope they are better.  How is the son &amp; heir progressing?  Give him my love. 
 My love to you, John, Mr. Mack &amp; Mrs. Ellis &amp; remember me to all the men.
