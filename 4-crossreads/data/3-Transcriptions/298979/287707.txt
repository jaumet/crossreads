<p>to crawl on hands &amp; knees through mud &amp; water to enter a "dugout" the height of the roof being barely sufficient to enable one to sit up, &amp; mud, mud, the muddiest mud everywhere.</p>
<p>Although the living in such a place was horrible the men were in the best of order &amp; spirits for the Division had been ordered to march back to a billet. In the meantime an acquaintance with the new O/C made one more than regret the late one. Fancy men in a muddy state &amp; living under such conditions being given just 20 minutes to clean Rifle &amp; equipment &amp; be ready for inspection, &amp; one of the men whose rifle was a picture, was fined a days pay for having a dirtied bayonet, having evidently knocked against the muddy sides of the "Dug out" in getting out.</p>
<p>This was the first time this man was fined although he had been 7 years in the Imperial Army. A more disgusted man on that day there could not have been found, &amp; he never forgot nor forgave. He talked about that incident for days.</p>
<p>Attached to a small party, having to take a short cut when the Company started to move back, the Sentry had one experience with mud that he would not forget. After climbing a rise, a flat that did not look bad had to be crossed but the mud was quite up to the knees.</p>
<p>Instead of keeping to short steps, in trying to hurry he made a normal stride &amp; found it was then impossible to move either foot, and before the nearest man could "lend him a hand", both feet kept slipping till at last he fell full length into the mire. His Clothes &amp; Rifles were something awful to look at &amp; some of that mud seem to stick ever afterwards. Even the floors of the huts in which they camped had mud 3 &amp; 4 Inches deep within 10 feet of the door &amp; a spade had to be kept handy to remove the mud</p>
