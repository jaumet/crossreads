<p>Wrote to Miss Lusby yesterday &amp; Mac. today.<br/>14-8-16<br/>There was a blow up in the Bomb store today.  It was about 60 yds from us.  I thought a new Battery had opened up &amp; on coming out to have a look I found one of our Seargents dying &amp; a private badly wounded there were also some minor wounds.  I believe there has been 23 Casualties in the store [word deleted] in the last 3 days.  The Seargent was unlucky when the first Bomb exploded he tried to get away but got caught in the barbed wire fence surrounding the bomb enclosure.  I notice that we don't use the Cauldwell [Caldwell] Machine gun on this front only the Lewis.</p>
