the thing clean over. I nearly went under the load. Some of these English A.S.C. couldn't drive a tack.
5/6/16.
Oh! Day of Days! The company was warned to be in readiness to proceed to the forward area. Went under a medical examination. Several fellows were rejected. Drew shortages of kit from the Quarter Master Sergeant. Had to pay for a towel I had lost. What sort of a turn out is this where a man has to pay for his worn out kit after 10 months service and no new issues? Paraded in all our kit; did not mind it this time, now that we are pronounced fit for war. No one could look at this company of splendid fellows and think otherwise. Went down with Palmer, to the Caf Les Voyageurs and cracked a bottle of champagne.
