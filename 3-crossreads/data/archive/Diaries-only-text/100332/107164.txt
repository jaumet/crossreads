Fritz was putting shrapnel over everywhere trying to hit the balloons. After a Shrapnel shell would burst down would come the Nose Cap with a Whiz I could hear pieces of shell striking Huts all about. As a balloon was nearly overhead, we received a lively time in Camp. Our luck was in nobody was hit. After I signed on at 4 Pm the sun had set, the balloons all came down things were quiet for a while. At about 5-30 Fritz came over on a Bombing expedition. I was on my Engine up at St Jeau we all had an anxious time as there were several machines over bombs were dropping round about, but none came down in the yard. I could hear the Explosions along the Canal towards Regersberg. Fritz was about for over an hour then they all cleared out we had peace for the rest of the shift. When I arrived back to Camp my hut Mates told me that a Bomb exploded close handy the Mud pieces of Bomb had struck the hut but did not penetrate, as we have the Huts well sandbagged around the sides up to about 4 ft we are fairly well protected from Bombs only a direct hit would do us any harm.
