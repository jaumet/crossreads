<p>I spent such a pleasant week-end last week in London with your friend  Mrs. Robinson.  They have a Flat at the Cosmo Hotel &ndash; 3 bedrooms, sitting Room &amp; bath-room, and go down to the Dining Room for meals, it was so awfully kind of her to ask me.  She is so very nice &amp; is so good to me in my lonliness.  You have no idea what a pleasure it is to be with friends;  you see I've been living alone for seven months, have a bedroom &amp; sitting room with some folk here who give me breakfast &amp; Tea and I have my dinner mid-day at the Hospital.  I don't mind now the days are longer, but it got me quite down at last during the long dark winter nights, dark soon after four.  I used to work here till about six with gas light and then paddle home &ndash; I mean back to diggings &ndash; in the dark.<br/>Now my Dear I think I'll follow your lead &amp; reg. this as I want you to get it and must close &amp; post for the Aus. mail.<br/>Glad the Major keeps well, I can understand how weary he is of it all, but most of us feel the same</p>
