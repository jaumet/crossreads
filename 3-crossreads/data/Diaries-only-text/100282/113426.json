were Australians they should show more respect to an officer not pelt him, what do you think of that how we all laughed over it, they don't understand our lads, you should see our officers they bog in with any of the boys have a bit of fun.
This afternoon 4 officers 4 NCOs had to go to the firing line to have a look at what we will be taking over mostly it was a long walk up everything is frozen hard white as snow, a few shells fell unpleasantly close on the way up but we reached "Rose Wood" safely about sundown, we then had a drink of tea afterwards inspected our dugouts strong points, just before we left the Germans started to sling gas shells over in dozens we had to put our helmets on walk in them for a full mile during which time I managed to get a nasty whiff of gas fell in a new shell hole which they had dropped on the train line.
