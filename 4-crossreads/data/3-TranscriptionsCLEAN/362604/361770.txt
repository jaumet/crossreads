  
 Opera House" now a Picture Show.  It is a glorious place.  Lovely Halls, Lounge, Marble stair cases etc., all Pink carpeted with good-looking Lady attendants dressed in Pink Jackets & Knee Breaches to match.  I caught the 8.13 p.m. to Bulford & after 11/4 sit in the train in the cold at Salisbury we eventually reached this  nice  Place at 1.30 a.m.  I am just recovering from it.  Well my Dears, we are both well & as I am expecting a visitor & have some work to do, I'll wish you & all Neighbours & Friends, the Best of all Good Things. 
 Love From Harry.
