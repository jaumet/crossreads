<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but 4th Reinforcements 4th Field Ambulance.  There was nothing at all on wrapping to show where it came from &amp; I didn't recognise the writing, but on opening it a card fell out "With love from Aunt Mabel &amp; Dorothy," &amp; gave the address, so I acknowledged it the same day.  I was very lucky to get it at all as it had quite a wrong address on it.<br/>When I last wrote, I was expecting to go to England for 8 day's leave with my "boss" the Colonel   It came out in orders that the Officers were to take their batmen with them, so I thought I'd been going with my officer.  Counting on this I sent you a cable asking you to cable me &pound;10 to Commonwealth Bank, London; at the same time I wrote to the Bank asking them to send me over the Identification Papers, &amp; also advise me when the money had arrived.  I received a reply from them on the 18th. inst saying that the money had arrived &amp; they enclosed the necessary papers, that I at once filled in &amp; got the Colonel to sign.  I must thank you very much, Father dear, for replying to that cable so quickly.  I do hope it wasn't any bother or worry to you, Dad.  The Colonel</p>
