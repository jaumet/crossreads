<p>November 2<br/>Wrote to Erskine Macdonald again after From an Outpost, and reminding him of the not turning up of "The Poetry Review":  the 4th issue of M.F. books, the October lot still 'missing',.. but judging from the quality of the first three batches the loss is not too terrible.</p>
<p>This afternoon with Frank D. to the Kookaburras again:  a good show and enjoyed.  Mail:  a letter from Nick, doing well, and he wondering if he'll take an offered 3 months at Boulogne:  wondering!!!</p>
<p>102.<br/>A casual remark of Hunter's and a rum toddy &ndash; oh the loveliness inspired by the following reveries of a rum toddy &ndash; sets me thinking "while the bore talketh" of a camp we held once years ago at Stanwell Park. .. Years ago or 1911, or perhaps 1912&hellip;Gerald, and Geoff and myself,&hellip; and the first night they, Fort St., and I the S.G.S. had a great row of the respective merits and standings of the two schools.  Oh God for that week again&hellip;we lived on tinn'd stuff, corn and beans and rabbit, and each of us promised three respective Mothers we'd eat of fresh meat once a day!  Once a day, and only once did we ever see fresh meat.  To keep our promise we walked to Clifton &ndash; came back through the railway tunnel &ndash; back at camp put beef steak on to boil &ndash; made for the surf, and compleately forgot our meat tea&hellip;.  when we got back a dead fire was under a dried up billy, full of burnt cindered meat&hellip;..</p>
<p>Three Pagans loose from all customary routine of school and home, free in the bush, by a rich sensuous surf&hellip; and now Gerald's here in damned France, in the Flying Corp, Geoff about a qualified M.O., and I'm on night duty in an old operating tent &ndash; an R.I.P. for bombing raids!</p>
<p>November 3<br/>7 a.m.  Not to be outdone by the mists and clouds, shells from midnight till now, a quiet night, and not a single dressing:  the only visitor a 26nd Batt. boy after a drink&hellip;we stood him rhum.  The day promises another full of mists and drizzle.</p>
<p>At 3.30 this morning our guns on the left opened out rather heavily, even to the guns about here:  they slackened after an hour's full going.</p>
