arrived with a few others, looking for the water cart.. This meant more conviviality and about 1 o'clock everyone was so happy that the water cart was entirely forgotten. All that was required was "a fair" crack of the whip" Frank Woods lay down in the road and went to sleep. I was not too well and went back to camp. The last thing I saw was "Miles" proposing the health of "Maudie" standing on the roof of a transport waggon. The Water cart eventually arrived about 4 a.m. and very remarkable, it was actually filled. 
 
Saturday 15th
On Gas Picket and Aeroplane lookout from 6 till 9 at 9 woke up Lanc (my relief) had Breakfast, Bacon Toast and Butter then "turned in" and had another sleep. Things quiet all day, although plenty of aeroplanes about. Only one case came in during the night, the N.Z. relieved our Batt. in the trenches last night and about 9 o'clock Fritz started the ball rolling. A shell dropped in the trenches, killing 2 and injuring 2. These were the last cases we received as the N.Z. Amb. relieved us at about 11. Then we had another exciting trip along the roads to Headquarters. The guns were playing up everywhere. 2 signallers were blown to pieces, but we arrived quite safely about 2.30 a.m. 
Sunday 16th
The rest of the crowd greeted us very heartily. Payney and a host of others came round and shook hands and made us feel like bloomin? ?eroes. We got to bunk in the orderly room about 3, slept till 9 then got up and had breakfast. Just as I was getting up, Ted brought me 6 letters which was just great. 4 from Lill 1 from Nell and 1 from Mother. This is a big brewery where we are staying. Using it as a Cas. Clearing Hosp. No of gassed cases came in during the night. The brewery is in working order and there is plenty of Beer to be had for the asking.
