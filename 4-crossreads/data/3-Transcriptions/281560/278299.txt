<p>18/9/16.<br/>Drilling about the place is the order of the day. I drew a new Box respirator today, they are a vast improvement on the old one. I am taking an interest in the Lewis Machine Gun; it is interesting and will releive the monotony. We have been issued with Anti Frost Bite grease to rub on our feet to prepare them for the winter. Received much mail, it is the only thing that makes this life bearable.<br/>21/9/16.<br/>We were paid 14/-. As the weather cleared, we practised a little with the new Box helmets. The 3rd Battalion had sports this afternoon. General Plumer commanding the 2nd Army was present. It was decent of him not to make us parade to him. He wore a monocle, this old geezer, and looked so quaint.</p>
