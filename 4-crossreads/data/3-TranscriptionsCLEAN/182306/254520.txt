 We had nothing much to do here so tried to amuse ourselves shooting water fowl & bombing fish in the Swamps. We had some good Sport. & plenty of wsimming int he locks. We left here on the 29th Sept. and passed up through the hindenburg line. which he had been pushed out of a couple of days before. We took over the front line on the 1st Oct. The big stunt came off on the 3rd at 5-30 am
