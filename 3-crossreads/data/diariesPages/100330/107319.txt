Thursday 31/5/17
After resting all day I went for a walk out past the Munition Works while I was passing the works the girls were coming out. It being 6.30 Pm the time they finish work for the day.There are a fairly large number of Women employed there, they dress strange. They all wear baggy overalls look like a lot of old Men from a distance. I noticed a few men here there. After continuing my walk along the Canal I came back through the Village to Camp took up my duties at 9 Pm. Everything was quiet until when the Siren again blew one blast, in a few minutes shells were exploding away to the North and Search lights were seen in several directions. The Shells were exploding up very high gradually worked around in a Westerly direction likewise the Search lights were playing up amongst the clouds looking for Fritz who evidently was somewhere about. The Siren sounded at 11.35 Pm the Shellls were bursting in the Air until after 1 am. No doubt it was a great sight, reminded me of a Fire Works display.
