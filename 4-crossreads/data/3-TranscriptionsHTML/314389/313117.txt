<p>(16th).  List of Australian killed.  Bert Argall 2330.  Goodbye, Bert.  You were one of the real good sort.  Your character and moral temperament were an example to us all.  Your life was given for a righteous cause.  May God comfort your own dear ones in the hour of darkness and distress.  May they realise that you died fighting in freedom's cause.  You lived for the right and you died upholding justice and purity, the lovely graces which the Hun would besmirch.  I was with you and G. McInnes at the Ezbekiah Gardens and the Methodist Room for soldiers, Egypt.  Retire 10 p.m.</p>
<p>Wednesday, July 19th:<br/>Rise 6 a.m.  We leave Harponville at 3 p.m. and catch motor omnibuses to Albert, then march close to La Bosselle, where we bivouac and then out to trenches at dusk.  We get lost and don't arrive to bivouac quarters till next morning about 5 a.m.</p>
<p>Thursday, July 20th:<br/>Arrive to bivouac as stated above, turn in, try to sleep, but the guns are too constant to allow slumber.  We go out again at night and dig trenches in No Man's Land.  We are treated to shells, trench mortars, and have a hot time.  You bet we dug in for our lives, but I arrive home safe again, but feeling weary and fatigued.  Return home about 4 a.m. on the 21st.</p>
