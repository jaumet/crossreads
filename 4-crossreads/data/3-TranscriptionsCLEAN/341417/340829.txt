Mrs Kate F Stribley99 Sheppard St[reet]Sydneyas soon as possible on receipt of my letter.We were in a very hot corner - first things all our own way, but their machine guns got a cross fire & the artillery came up & things weren't anything too rosy. Stribley was one of my best men that morning that is saying a lot. Rob Wilson landed here the night before.We had not enough sound horses to mount them when we moved off at 12.30 am. However every man had to come up later riding anything. They got under heavy fire but did not join the Sqd till we retired. Rob had got a fair horse from somewhere & seemed quite cool though I doubt whether he knew the points of the compass. He came on that night & next day. The squadron formed the screen on a six mile drive so I did not actually see much of him. However he is back here safe & sound, having gone through a stiff test at top speed all the time. I am very pleased at the way the latest reinforcements shaped.
