JULY   MONDAY 17   1916
A warm day but very dull. Capt Campbell took some of us down to watch the heavy artillary firing  There were three batteries of 60 pounders practising  Was on fatigue in the stables in afternoon, carting dirt to them. I got two parcels in afternoon from Linda, a tobacco pouch & my ring. They are both beauties and I just wanted that pouch. I heard from Mother. She is taking a room in London for a bit.
