<p>Saturday 20 October 1917<br/>Very hot weather but we manage to play quoits, knit and generally get through the day very successfully.  Of the travelling companions I have none has appealed to me as a future friend save S. Henry, Longreach, Q.  She stands along as a fine character.<br/>Principal trials on board mentally &ndash;<br/>Loss of a well informed man such as have been used to &ndash; to impart necessary information on everything.  Loss of just one real friend to whom one could confide the hundred and one little things of daily life.  A great feel of future loneliness in a strange land but it may be less fearsome than it looks.</p>
