Down Hawaii way, where I chanced to stayOn an ev'ning I heard a Hula maiden playJacka hula hickey dula duDown Hawaii way by the moon-light BayWhen I lingered a while, she then stole my heart away.
Yack hula hickey dula duOh! I don't care if you loved the ladies far & nearYou'd forget about them all if you could hearJack hula hickey dula du.
ChorusI'm coming back to you my hula Loubesides the sea at Waikiki you'l play for me& once again you'll sway my heart your wayWith your jack hula hickey dula tune.
2Down Hawaii you would love to stayif you'd ever see how those Hula's bend & swayJack hula hickey dula duDown Hawaii while the breakers playwith a movement just like the wave those Hula's Say
