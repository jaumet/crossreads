<td style="text-align: left; vertical-align: top;">the Somme front.&nbsp; Some crater.&nbsp; Managed to get it nearly filled.&nbsp; Returned to billet at 4.&nbsp; Found I had left my gas helmets where I was working.&nbsp; Had to rush back for them as we had received orders to fall in in full pack ready for another march.&nbsp; Got back to billet only to find that the company had started on their way and nobody knew whence there were making.&nbsp; Set out on the road at a quick pace in the hope of catching the company up.&nbsp; Marching in full pack at the pace I was making soon wore me out and I found the company spelling on the side of the road.&nbsp; Got to them just as they began to march again and had to fall in and march along with them.&nbsp; Did the next spell of marching and when the halt came, I felt faint and spent.&nbsp; Luckily, we spelled opposite a canteen where Larsen went and got me a bottle of sodawater which revived me somewhat.&nbsp; Got to a place which proved to be Favrieul, to the left and in front of Bapaume.&nbsp; A most delightful and pretty place, though somewhat battered and knocked about, but a veritable paradise after Valux.&nbsp; Went into a commodious and fairly comfortable billet belonging to the old Chateau where we were away from the continued roar of howitzers and other engines of war.</td>
