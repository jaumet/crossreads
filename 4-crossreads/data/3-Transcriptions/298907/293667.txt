<p>Ward.   Mac brought it round to me &amp; asked me to write her a reply, so I set myself out to write her a letter that would make her lift her eyebrows, you never saw such a letter the terms of endearment I used &amp; etc, I practically exhausted my stock of adjectives, &amp; when I finished it I called some of the nurses over &amp; read it out to them they nearly died laughing &amp; it was passed round for all to read, they reckoned it was a masterpiece &amp; would cause a sensation if printed in the papers, when Macs breach of promise" comes off, the whole Ward was in an uproar, &amp; the Sister had a job to stop the laughing &amp; chuckling long after lights out. Some of the lads nearly burst their sides so tickled were they.</p>
