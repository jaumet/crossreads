Fry Esq,Lindfield,
Dear Sir,I was deeply grieved to learn of the death of your son Dene and should like to offer my very sincere sympathy to you & your family in your great loss. Almost no death in the war has upset me more than your son's. He was such an attractive lad personally, and we looked upon him here as one of our most promising students and were looking forward to his remaining connected with this Department for a long time.
Yours sincerely,S. J. Johnston.
