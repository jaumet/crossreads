<p>It was market day to day and thousands of natives thronged the road leading to town and a large yard which is the Market Square on the outskirts of the village was packed. All sorts of things were there for barter fowls geese Turkeys Cattle sugar cane Etc Etc. and such a merry crowd of happy go lucky natives in all sorts of costumes made a picture never seen nor conceived in the Occidental world.</p>
