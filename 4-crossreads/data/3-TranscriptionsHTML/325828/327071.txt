<p>No 5 Matham Grove,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 15.12.17.<br/>East Dulwich<br/>London S.E. 22.<br/>20.10.17.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I am down at my London "home" on 6 days leave from Shawbury.  As before, both Mr. &amp; Mrs Hammond have been exceedingly kind.  I was getting really fagged out &amp; nervy, &amp; was granted 6 days leave.  Almost at the same time I had a pressing invitation from the Hammonds to spend my time in London at their home if I cared to do so.  I accepted their kind invitation, &amp; arrived down here late on Tuesday night (about 11 p.m.)  I found a huge supper waiting for me, after which Mr. H. &amp; I had a <u>cigar</u> <strike>over</strike> in front of an asbestos gas fire, (for it is very cold over here now) &amp; then oh! glory! a lovely soft feather bed, <u>with sheets.</u>  After camp life it was simply A1.  I slept without a break till 11.30 the following morning when Mrs. Hammond woke me with tea &amp; toast, &amp; after a bath &amp; shave I shoved my feet into carpet slippers &amp; strolled downstairs to breakfast.  Breakfast at 12 p.m. mind you.  Talk about luxury.</p>
