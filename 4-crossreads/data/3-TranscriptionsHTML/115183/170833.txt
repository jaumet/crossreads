<p>(67)<br/>a couple of very pleasant hours looking around Hazebrouck, and then after a nice tea, walked back to the main road and caught a lorry going to Bailleul, from whence we had to walk home to Westhof. We had had a very pleasant if unauthorised, excursion. I bought some views to send home. The next day 26th June I was occupied as cooks fatigue, but in the evening some of us walked about a mile and a half over to a wood where some tanks were parked. Here we found about 40 tanks which had taken part, so we were told in the battle for Wytschaete Ridge, they were lined up under the trees out of sight of enemy eyes. We were permitted to have a look inside them at the big petrol engines, the two small howitzers, the Lewis guns and racks of ammunition and the pilots seats and controls. We were also able to see a few on the move  and the visit proved a very interesting one as we had never seen them before. The previous day they had been inspected by the King and Queen of Belgium.</p>
