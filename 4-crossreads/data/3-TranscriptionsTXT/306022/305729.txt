dolphins and swordfish
There was fighting going on every where and swordfish jumping all over the place. Our officers had two of the service rifles out with ball ammunition and were taking snapshots at the swordfish, several of which they hit. They blew one sharks fin to atoms.
As there was smoke on the horizon from some unknown steamer, probably a neutral all portholes were closed and all lights out, at dusk.
