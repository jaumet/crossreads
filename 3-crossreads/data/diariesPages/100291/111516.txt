March Friday 2 1917
Something doing again early this morning. Fritz counter attacked to capture some of our men. Our chaps met him fair square. Gave him a great line up capturing about 40. half of those who came over.
We were kept very busy all day 7 stretcher cases of Fritz tho" about 9 walking cases, also some of our own boys. One with right-foot blown off. Had to hold it while M.O. dressed stumpy.
Interesting talk with prisoners ? a corporal who spoke English very well. Receive 15 letters some of the late ones arriving telling about Xmas. My mouth watered that much over description of dinner that I had to get up chew some dry biscuits.
