<p>There was a Hun in a pozzy just about 70 yards in front of our trench, &amp; he had a bang at me as I was walking along the top of the top of the trench, it is safer walking along the bottom of the trench but a bally nuisance round corners &amp; bumping the narrow sides, so generally we take a risk &amp; walk in comfort, &amp; much more quickly along the top. He threw over some shells for a while tonight, but they fell about 30 yards behind us. Our trench mortar shook one of his machine gun pozzies up in No Man's land. Things were very lively away over to our left, artillery fire galore, &amp; Fritz was sending up all sorts of flares, white lights, red, green &amp; all sorts, evidently he was being raided by one of our battalions. Wedn. 26 June Came back to our platoon at daybreak. We are being relieved tonight by the 50th Bn. &amp; I had to go back as guide for our platoon. They'd break your heart the great method they show; instead of, as I expected, meeting the new company just down the road by supports, &amp; guiding them up to their position in the line, the guide for each platoon had to go away back to where the 50th were resting near Daours. They gave us scarcely any directions for getting there, but luckily I had been down on the false alarm trip some</p>
