  
 Some trouble with her turbines. 15,000 tons register & formally built for 18 knots. 
 June 6 Still at anchor in outer roads awaiting orders. Crew & troops exercised at boat drill. All sore leaving Marseilles after spending a rare old time there. One of the pleasure resorts of Europe. Very dangerous at night on account of the lamps being shaded the lights dim & robberies under arms the result. Yet the French & Brittish have soldiers & police parading night & day. The population consists of such a cosmopolitian races. Spoke to one of the naval officers at my table who was until a few months ago 3 1/2 years a prisnor of war in Germany. Berlin. He said some of the prisnors were very badly treated. (He being interned from one of the British ships & in a seperate camp to the war-prisnors were fairly well treated.) 
 June 7 Our firemen causing trouble therefore the Indarra & Canberra could not keep up the regulation speed of 14 1/2 speed so that the speed had to be reduced to 14. Later during the day speed increased to 15 knots. At 7 am the transport Kaisar I Hind 400 yards abreast of us hoisted signals a man over-board. The Jap distroyer astern 1 mile stopped & signalled that they picked him up & was doing well. A splendid bit of work.
