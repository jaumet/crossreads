<p>Saturday 19 May 1917.</p>
<p>No sight of land yet this morning. &nbsp;Everyone looking out for it all the same all day. NO RESULT</p>
<p>On no duty today and feel benefit of being above deck in fresher air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good day at sea all the day, today. &nbsp;Feeling, good oh! now.</p>
<p>At 12.15 p.m. we followed the Cruiser &quot;Encounter&quot; in a decided Nth Wstly direction.</p>
<p>Believe we are fairly close to land compared to before.</p>
<p>Close to &quot;Encounter&quot; all day.</p>
<p>Sing-song up on deck in evening</p>
<p>G.S.S. Crmn<sup>&nbsp;</sup>&amp; I thinking where we wold be at this time if on week-end leave in Vic.</p>
<p>10 days. now since leaving Pt. Melb. pier.</p>
