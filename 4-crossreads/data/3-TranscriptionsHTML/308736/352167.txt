<p>a dead french woman.</p>
<p>Thursday Oct. 10th<br/>Took the guard to fill water cart from a well 100 ft. deep (Hard work).  Packed up after dinner.  I had to wait behind and pack cooks cart with spare gear, left Montbrehian and went across country outside some towns, saw more dead than I could count.  After travelling a couple of hours, the driver found out he was lost, I with two others went to try and find the lines, when we got back found he had cleared out, we then wandered round until dark, we  we got a dose of gas, then camped in a farm house in some straw without blankets, got tea from some Yanks.</p>
<p>Friday Oct. 11th<br/>On the road again 6 a.m. found H.Q. lines and had a cup of tea, then wandered on until we found some mates, had breakfast with them, then on again until we found the battery lines at Busigny, I was then put on cooking again, one of the cooks went on leave to "blighty".  Plenty vetegables growing near us, living high on them.<br/>10-30 p.m.  Fritz started shelling all round us, wounded two men, killed five horses and wounded eleven, smashed two wheels on a wagon, kept up the shelling for over an hour, one landed not twenty yds. from my dug out.</p>
<p>Saturday Oct. 12th<br/>Cleared out to new wagon lines after dinner, put in a quiet night for a change.  Rained all night.</p>
<p>Sunday Oct. 13th<br/>Just before dinner Fritz put over a barrage in front of us.  The 42nd had 16 horses killed by shells so shifted their lines.  W. Lewis came back from leave.</p>
<p>Monday Oct. 14th<br/>A glorious morning, our planes very busy, so is Fritz with his antis.  During afternoon saw a good "box on" between some planes, one of ours came down.</p>
<p>Tuesday Oct. 15th<br/>Put in a quiet day.</p>
<p>Wednesday Oct. 16th<br/>Rained all night and morning.  After dinner went over to a german coal dump in search of a stove, but missed.</p>
<p>Thursday Oct. 17th<br/>A fresh attack was made on Fritz.  A very foggy morning.  Got eleven letters from Aussie.</p>
<p>Friday Oct. 18th<br/>Another attack opened.  Tommies got knocked back.  Moved off to a new position.  Passed a batch of prisoners.</p>
<p>Saturday Oct. 19th<br/>Another thick fog.  Started raining during afternoon.  A Yankee band is camped alongside us, played some good music.</p>
