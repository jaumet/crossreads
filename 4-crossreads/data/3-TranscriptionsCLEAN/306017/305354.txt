  
 Turkish dates we found  & we were all fairly weak.  The only water we had was some dirty looking stuff we got out of an oasis but it tasted well to us.  We dismounted near Katia nearly 16 or 17 regiments of LH took part & we advanced in short rushes across the marshy ground before Katia   We came under heavy rifle & machine gun fire also howitzers & field guns.  We got what cover we could & lay there for 4 hrs.  We were not properly supported on the right & about 6.30 we withdrew.  The fire was dreadful, but we got all our wounded back. 
 I never felt so done in all my life.  I could no more run than I could fly & I don't think I cared whether I got hit or not.  My tongue & mouth was so swollen I could not chew a biscuit.  Pieces got between my teeth & gums.  When I got some water it did not relieve me a bit.  We left Katia about 7.30 & rode back to El Maleh camp getting there after 10 oclock
