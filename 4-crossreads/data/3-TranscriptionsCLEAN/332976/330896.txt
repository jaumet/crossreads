July 191713th   indiscretion on my part is was deemed best that I should not go, although I had been "booked" for it for some time & the Div. Regimental S.M. went in my place.   This would, in all probabilities have meant a spell of 5 to 6 months in Blighty for me.15th   This morning Nos 2 & 4 sections went for a route march along the canal as far as ------------ a village about 5 Km from here & returned by a circuitous route doing in all about 10 miles.   We had the afternoon off & most of us went for a swim in the canal.
