  
 March 1915 Friday 19 Caps issued to troops. They look real smart in them. Tomorrow military sports are to be held at Mena House grounds. A competition is to be held in the 2nd Batt. in drilling to see which is the smartest platoon. Appetites still good. 
 Saturday 20 Orderly told us to get all our clothes ready to be fumigated for tomorrow at 10 oclock. We have to make a list of all of our things. Great scrambling. Arthur came to see me this afternoon & brought an Egyptian friend who is studying for a lawyer. He gave us much information about Egyptian History most of which I had already read. Sister scooted them out of the ward as it is infectious.
