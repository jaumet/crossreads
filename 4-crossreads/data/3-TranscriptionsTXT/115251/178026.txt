Supplement to par: 3  Since capture of "Komet" Mr Whiteman has acted as Paymaster of "Komet" & also as Native Intelligence Officer.  Important information re Enemy's merchant cruisers is in "Komets" log & Colonel Paton with assistance of Mr Whitemen has collected such information.Mr Whiteman has also made a complete list of stores onboard "Komet" & his business knowledge has saved me an immense amount of trouble, my time being fully occupied in navigating the two vessels under my command.
