<p>At about 5 oclock a bayonet charge livened things up considerably and many prisoners were captured. We captured about 800 prisoners, one whole battalion giving in. hundreds of prisoners were captured by other units. The 2nd LH Regt captured about 8 oclock the whole army medical outfit dozens of camels thousands of rifles and much equipment and ammunition dozens of wounded Turks were collected There are also scores of dead. Lieut Righetti and Sergeant Jepson are lying close together both shot through the head and both stripped for their superior clothing and boots which are of course better material than the Turks. All our dead are stripped like that.</p>
