<p>Saturday 29 April 1916<br/>Still glorious weather, sunny &amp; warm but with a rather strong wind from inland which raised a good deal of sand &amp; dust. Went to the dentist &amp; thence into Etaples on mess business in the morning &amp; in the afternoon was kept going censoring letters &amp; attending to matters.<br/>At night had a joke on Prescott who had gone to Boulogne for the afternoon, fixing his bed up &amp; turning the tent about as it stood.</p>
