 though they would capsize, and then off they go in another direction 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must have had nearly 1000 men on guard duties on the ship. 
 It was estimated that with every porthole closed, the quantity of 
 air thus imprisoned in the vessel would have the effect of keeping h 
 her afloat half an hour longer than would be the case were she tor- 
 pedoed and all portholes left open.&nbsp; In consequence of this a 
 &quot;Porthole Guard&quot; was put on one man to each two portholes.&nbsp; This 
 guard was on day and night and their duty was , in the event of an 
 alarm to screw down the ports and then get on deck.&nbsp; This acted very 
 well, the whole ship was inspected at each alarm and we never found 
 a porthole left open.&nbsp; I dont know how many portholes a big passenger 
 ship like this carries on either side, but I should imagine that it 
 necessitated a guard of about 400 men.&nbsp; At each lifeboat and raft, 
 day and night were stationed three men with loaded rifles and fixed 
 bayonets.&nbsp; They were there in case of a rush on the boats and their 
 instructions were very short and to the point.&nbsp; Each Officer was com- 
 pelled to carry a loaded revolver to be freely used in the event of 
 panic.&nbsp; Guards provided with glasses were placed at numerous points 
 on the deck to watch a given sector of the ocean for periscopes. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By night, not a light was allowed anywhere where it could be 
 seen from outside.&nbsp; The first night out the men were allowed to sleep 
 on the decks, but despite warnings, they would strike matches to light 
 their cigarettes, consequently they were all bundled down below and 
 never again allowed on deck after sunset. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We touched in at Malta for a few hours but did not go ashore. 
 The town of Valetta is situated on the steep rocky slopes of the 
 South East corner of the Island and consists of buildings of a severe 
 square type without verandahs or balconies.&nbsp; The harbour is partly
