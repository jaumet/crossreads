<p>did everything that was asked of them, and more, but are they</p>
<p>entitled to all this fuss being made of them?&nbsp; Men who have been</p>
<p>to both campaigns will tell you that they get more strafe here in</p>
<p>one day than they got in Gallipoli in a month, but that the</p>
<p>conditions of living in France are a picnic compared to what they</p>
<p>had to put up with on the Peninsular.&nbsp; Undoubtedly they had to</p>
<p>put up with hardships and they bore them well, but are these</p>
<p>hardships to be compared with what Townsends men had to contend</p>
<p>with at Kut, or the forces at Salonica, or the men who endeavoured</p>
<p>to relieve Townsend?&nbsp; I believe in kudos being handed out to men</p>
<p>when they deserve it, provided a correct standard of comparison</p>
<p>has been maintained, but I contend that in our case this has not</p>
<p>been done otherwise we should not be receiving the major portion</p>
<p>of the lime light which we certainly appear to be getting, now.</p>
