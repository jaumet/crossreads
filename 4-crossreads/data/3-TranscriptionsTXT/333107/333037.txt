Sat. May 11thGlory: Alleluia. Got a Big Mail this morning. 22 Letters, from Lill, Mother, France, Kath, Nell, and Aunt Nell. My head is still buzzing from reading them.
There were 6 Letters from Lill, but one of 'em made me feel like a worm. I know I deserve it, so I can't growl. Got a note from Bank to say money was there, so now if I am lucky enough to pass the Board at Weymouth, it will come in handy.
Sun. May 12Comm. squaring up my mail. Wrote to Lill, France, Kath and sent specimen signatures to the Bank. It has been a glorious day.
We are not "annoyed" by many visitors at this place.
I hear today that all C1 are going down to Weymouth. I wish they would make out my Board Papers and send me down there. I'd soon know the worst then.
Mon. May 13Wrote Letter 21 to M.S. and inserted a few Home Truths.
