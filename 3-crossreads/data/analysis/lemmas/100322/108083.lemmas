 21/5/19 London expens and they charg for the old way . Sat in Dr Johnson 's seat . Afterward did the Strand , Leicest Sq Piccadilli where much bargain was go on . I have seen no citi where prostitut is so brazen evid as in London . The hotel are now open till 10.30 and there were mani peopl a bit merri . In the bar women mingl with the men drain their pot and smoke . In Pari women take their drink in a more refin way ? sit at a tabl . The tube are handi but antiqu and vile ventil . Went to Trafalgar Squar and paid a guinea for a balconi stall at Theres Pagliacci at Covent Garden tonight . Return to the hotel at Paddington ? the Norfolk ? and was fast asleep by midnight . The move stairway in London tube are a great idea and could be extend and made to move faster .
