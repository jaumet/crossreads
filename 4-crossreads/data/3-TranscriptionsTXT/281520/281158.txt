 Bapaume 18/3/17 Fierce arguments among QM staff as to whether Fritz is lousier then we are.  Such gems of conversation as float over here from the staff positively corruscate with oaths.  "Jonah" considers that war is good as these places are so old that they want knocking down.  One house dated 1723 was smouldering today &ndash; "by the f...." is a stock phrase of Jones.  MM.

Slept like a top throughout until morning.
