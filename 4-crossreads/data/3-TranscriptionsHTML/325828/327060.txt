<p>I think you had better address my letters to:-<br/>C/o H. Hammond Esq.<br/>No 5, Matham Grove,<br/>East Dulwich,<br/>London  S.E. 22<br/>as I have made arrangements with Mr. Hammond to forward me letters on to me.<br/>I must close now hoping you all at "Cairnleith" are in good health.<br/>I expect to leave Hospital tomorrow to rejoin my Squadron at Shawbury, as the swelling on the jaw has gone down &amp; I am keen to get back.<br/>With love to you all,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
