good grilled steak, etc.
   The evening pleasantly and profitably spent at a picture show, the Somme Battlefield, and then home to Lark Hill, falling asleep in the car and waking with a jolt to find that the car had killed a bunny for the driver's breakfast.

   With best love,
 
      Yours
 
       Harold.
