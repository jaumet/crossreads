All the officers of a certain battalion whose back hair we were parting with 18 prs for a few weeks when they came out were great stickers for this battery & as they are in the next billet in reserve for a bit are keen on coming & watching when we are beefing it in.  I am pleased to say that much of the infantry don't regard us as a fancy corps - no mans land is very narrow where they were and its anxious work knocking Fritz's parapet but their Col. who is a fine cove & loves his men used to sool me on & chance it.

Jolly hard luck wasnt [it].  I feel most awfully sorry for the Judge. Oh, Weston is the Doc for a battalion just come in on front.  Masters was sleeping in his dugout & told me about a Yankee Doc.
