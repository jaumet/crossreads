<p>May 1917<br/>13th.   Sunday.-  The good weather still continues &amp; is well appreciated.   We have done very little work owing no-doubt to the fact that the remainder of the <strike>section</strike> Company have started to move down here.<br/>15th.   One blanket was handed in to day, leaving us with one each.<br/>17th   We have been doing very little since the 13th. except small jobs scattered about the village and at Vaux.<br/>The weather has not been very good of late, &amp; we have had plenty of rain.<br/>18th.   The weather has been fairly warm to-day &amp; the aeroplanes very active on both sides.   I have been drawing out plans for a bridge to be built on a canal 5 or 6 miles from here, to carry artillery.</p>
