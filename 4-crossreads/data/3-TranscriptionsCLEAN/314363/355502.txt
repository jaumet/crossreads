  
 he was in a bad way when I saw him at the G.G.S. After I had the field dressing put on I hurried around the aid post, which was near our first position over the Somme. As they they were attacking again, by this time the prisoners were comming  back in groups, in making my way round to the aid post I kept close to the hill, I heard a large shell pass over my head which made me drop down, this shell landed in the middle of a group of german prisoners about forty in all, it could not have been a better shot, they were only about thirty yards away, it got about fifteen of them I was told later. When I reached the aid post I thought of waiting for a car, but when another shell landed close bye I decided to make my way out on foot, as quick as possible. There was a string of prisoners going out some carrying wounded. I arrived safely at the Field Ambulance, 10th if I remember correctly, then was taken by motor lorry to another field ambulance. At the first place I had an injection of serum against tetanus, it was in the arm, did not hurt much.
