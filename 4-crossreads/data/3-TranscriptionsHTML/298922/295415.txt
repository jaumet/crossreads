<p>Friday 30 March 1917</p>
<p>Very Hot.</p>
<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]  Letters from wife, Cousins &amp; May Harrison up to Feb. 8th also Australasian from you - &amp; other Papers. Please tell MAY I can <u>not</u> write so often as I would wish, you tell her my news but with the Wife &amp; you &amp; my work more is impossible. In case we move out quickly I'll post this now.</p>
<p>The letters by Miss Hanbury Davies are hung up. No women allowed to leave Egypt at present. I do not know the Lady but Mrs. Cuth Fetherston Hough was good enough to hand them on. <strike>Love to all, Son</strike></p>
