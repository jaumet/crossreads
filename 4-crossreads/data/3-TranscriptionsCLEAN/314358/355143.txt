4boldly thrust a pen and drawn the simple details as a rustic place.There before me as though of indian ink on the whitest of paper, is a black and white gem.I shall only describe some of the black of it.There is no other way.\A few leafless trees.A streatch of broken fenceThe underwood of a furze tangleThe eaves, one wall, and a smoking chimney of an old farm cottage.Less than half a haystackThe leafless stems of a hawthorne hedge.The sombre butts and the under plumes of a pine-wood thicket.The white and all which is lost in white, I cannot describe.The picture is as crude as any description, but it has the beauty of being real.
