Same date.<br/>Just had another Taube scare we could hear him coming but could not locate him on account of great clouds when he was visible there was a holly Scatter to get clear of the camp. We spread out to the four winds of heaven like a drop of oil on water. He came directly overhead and when he had passed our camp he let go 3 bombs They came down through the air like express trains they make terrifying sound &ndash; and they burst the other side of our watering place among the sand dunes &ndash; no damage done He came back to see the result of his work &ndash; circled around a while &ndash; and then flew home.
