NOV.   THURSDAY 2   1916
Fine. Got into London about 7.45 AM & went to the Regents Palace & had breakfast & then on to Auntie Florence  I went down to [?} House, the Flying Corps Headquarters & got a form for a commission. Auntie, Mrs Angus & self went over the Tower of London in afternoon & it was very interesting to see all the old things there & compare them with the modern articles used for the same purpose. I got the 8.15 train back to camp & had to walk from Amesbury & that 3 mile walk just spoils a jolly welcome spell.
