but there did not seem any prospect of a fight for we could see none of ours but all of a sudden from out of the clouds there darted one of our small squat fighting machines he poured a few rapid bursts into him, in a few minutes we saw the Hun burst into flames down he started he kept fairly good control of her till he got within a thousand feet or so of the ground, then she took a mad dive headed straight for the ground she must have hit the land with terrific force for when she struck we distinctly saw sparks smoke fly from her in a cloud, how they all cheered when she was coming down you could hear them for miles miles One of our ballons broke loose this afternoon rose to a tremendous height, our gunners fired a few shots after her but did not get her so they let her go, both of the observers hopped out came down in a parachute they would just about fall in our lines.
