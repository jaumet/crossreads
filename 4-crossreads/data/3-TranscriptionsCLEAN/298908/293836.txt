our overcoats on the wire.We were all paid last night consequently the huts were fairly empty last night.  You can easily tell when the boys are cashed up for they seldom come home of a night.
6th.  Have had a rotten day first of all the whole crowd were sorted out in alphabetical order on parade & then an officer went round & checked each mans name on the nominal roll.  This took till nearly 12 oclock & then hanged if we did not march down to the Medical hut & went through an inspection for scabies & that other curse, by this time it was nearly 1 oclock & our dinner was at 1.15 & our Coy. had also been detailed to attend the funeral of 2 of our chaps who had just died so straight away after dinner we fell in & marched off as we thought for a mile or two march but Lord bless my soul I never was so sick of anything in my life, we walked mile after mile up hill
