<p>To return to the life of the Camp.  I have seen 2/6 being offered for one well known Capstan Cigarette, used to be procurable at the rate of 8 for 3 pence previous to the Protest or Strike &amp; still the offerer had to goe without, as non wher forthcoming.  During the Evening of the day 12 Internees, in all instances, old &amp; feeble Internees colapsed on account of Weakness, the result of hunger.  They wher taken to the gate &amp; handet to the Military, the Provost Marshall Drumond promissing, that he would do all in his power to see that they would receive food.  I heard that they hawe been taken charge of by the ambulance &amp; taken to the hospital for treatement.  During this afternoon a young Internee to escape the pangs of hunger &amp; so preffered life inside jail, feinted a escape, by going through the Barbwire fence in broad daylight while guards, wher stationed all around.  One guard fired a shot into the air, &amp; the <strike>soldier</strike> Internee remained on the spot outside the fence untill the Police arived &amp; the Darlinghurst jail  28/  The following Notice wher issued to the Camp.  A Muster Parade will be held at 8.30am on March 1st (Saturday) &amp; if the dicipline is satisfactory &amp; no absentees to Company Comanders are elected for every Company the Authorities will confer with the Company Comanders with a View to remowe some of the present restrictiones  Signed R Holman.</p>
