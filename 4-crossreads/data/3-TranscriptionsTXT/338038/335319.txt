France.18.3.1917My dear Father & Mother,
We are back in our billets again after a hard three days in the line. Not hard in the fighting sense but in the way of inconvenience - we were ordered in to support another Division in the attack on Bapaume. After toiling all one night to get our guns in, we commenced our reconnaissance only to find the wiley Hun had retired behind Bapaume, so we had to turn round and come out again. The other Division went forward, but there wont be much fighting till the Bosche stops on his Cambrai line - He is very shrewd as his retirement hinders our offensive and he is saving his men
