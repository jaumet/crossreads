Got out at 6 as usual
Off to Fashn this morning so had to hurry about a bit, had a fair trip & got back early.
In the morning 1 battery of 18 pds & one Mountain Battery had battle practice assisted by the aeroplanes indirect firing was good I believe but they shelled the hills opposite with battery fire & didn't it remind us of the Penni, the niggers were thunder-struck with the row & think that after all we are going to do for them.
Went up the town at night & met some of the boys then came home - went to bed at 9.35.
Weather frightfully hot again, horses feeling it very much.
February 27, 1916 Sunday
Revielle as usual
Went to church this morning & afterwards groomed & cleaned my horse, she is nearly OK again from the kick she received. In the afternoon Capt Chisholm & I went out to Nazlet-el-ebeit on the motors, had a fair trip out, he came off a couple of times but nothing to speak, had plenty to eat on arrival there for I had afternoon tea in the officers mess left at 10 to 5 & got home at 6 to find a mail awaiting me, one from Nell, Mother & Pater, filled in a pleasant half hours  reading. Wrote answers to them & turned in at 9, wrote also to Alec who I got one from.
