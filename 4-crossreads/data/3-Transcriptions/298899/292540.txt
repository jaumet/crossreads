<p>du Champs de Mars, thence to the Eiffel Tower erected in 1887, nearly 1000 ft high &amp; the highest building in the world, constructed of iron work on four points, a wonderful edifice now used as a wireless station. Then across the Seine by the Pont A'lena to the Palais du Trocadero&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . The Palais built for the exhibition of 1878 is now a museum &amp; has accommodation for 5000 people, a splendid series of Cascades &amp; water fountains with statuary is in front of the building but not working at present. Had tea in the Place du Trocadero &amp; then drove by cab to the Hotel where I enquired where my friends resided. Took a taxi but found the girls out &amp; a Doctor and his wife being with Madam. I was received very well &amp; had an interesting yarn with the Doctor who was a Russian. He &amp; his wife knew very little English but we managed to hold a conversation OK &amp; they ended up by inviting me to dinner the following day. Russian is a beautiful language to listen to, being sweet &amp; soft. Later Madam Dobbevitch went &amp; rang up to tell her daughters</p>
