<p>Dear [A]linda</p>
<p>I have been in hospital here since Nov. 25th and I am much better now although not quite right yet. I don't know when they will let me go back to the Battery it may be some time yet our boys had a hard time the last stunt but we won what we set out for but when we were relieved we were all sick with that nasty <br/>smelling stuff.  I have almost recovered but am still weak but on the mend</p>
