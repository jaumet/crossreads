  
 has caused somewhat of a reign of terror in a mild way. A reward of 500 is offered for information leading to one being destroyed and the Transports & majority of Battleships have to lie in the Harbours. Fresh troops are landed at night by fast channel boats used as minesweepers. The ordinary trawlers are not fast enough to work against the strong tide of the narrows. 
 Saturday 29th. Did a short march about 8 miles to a village for exercise & saw some interesting scenes. We went into the village school & had a look at everything, all the youngsters gathering in one room for a photo. Then they sang their national anthem for our benefit while we gave a return with a concertina. We then endeavoured to photograph some girls & women washing at a well but as usual the young ones bolted at sight. We rarely see the young unmarried females. One of the funniest incidents I have witnessed was our march through the French camp. We were about 20 strong & were accompanied by a concertina. As we reached the camp our musician struck up the "Marseillaise" & the Frenchies ran out of their tents & lined the road clapping and cheering like mad. It was evidently the novelty as much as anything. We repeated the performance coming back. During the afternoon we received an issue of tobacco. One of the men of the "Vengeance" whom I met some days ago brought me a parcel of meat & bread. Nothing is too much trouble for them if they can help us in anyway.
