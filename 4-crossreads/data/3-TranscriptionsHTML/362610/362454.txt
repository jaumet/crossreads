<p>Saturday 26 August 1916<br/>A very broken rest only obtained owing to there being 4 of us in the compartment. About 4a.m. the train pulled up at a new siding close to Poperinghe in Belgium. It was raining, &amp; this showery weather continued right through the morning but gave place to a perfect sunny afternoon. It took some time to get the transport off the trucks &amp; everything ready to move off, &amp; then we had considerable difficulty in finding our camp.<br/>Hop fields with hops in bloom very noticeable after having been down south. People apparently low bred &amp; talking an unknown language. Had breakfast by the roadside as best we could &amp; eventually reached our quarters in ruberoid huts about 11 o'clock. In the afternoon went with the Brigade Major on horseback to meet the 4th Bn. at the station, &amp; greatly enjoyed the couple of hours ride, reaching home about 5 o'clock. A perfect evening.</p>
