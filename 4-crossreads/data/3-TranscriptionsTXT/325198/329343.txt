"Pinched from Rowdy book"my Creed
I would be true for there are those who trust me,I would be pure for there are those who care.I would be strong for there is much to suffer.I would be brave for there is much to dare.I would be friend to all the [pore?] the friendlessI would be giving & forget the giftI would be humble for I know my weaknessI would look up & laugh, and love & lift.
The Road to El Arish
On the road to El Arish, Oh it aint the place youd wishFor a picnic with your [indecipherable] or a spellFor the sand flies over all & your horse can hardly crawlAnd your twenty miles from  what they call a wellAnd the water when you get it well you try hard to forget itFor it taste as if it 'ad been drunk beforeAnd the sun is over head pourin down like molten leadWhy the 'ell did El Arish come in the war Why the 'ell did El Arish come in the war
Tommo reccomends this sung to the tune of the "Honeysuckle & the Bee". he comes at it after the "sixth"
