On the 28th we were in reserves. 30th in the front line. We only had about a mile to go, & when we were about 300 yds off our position they run us into a sap, it was full of mud, well, about a foot in the bottom. We got through that alright till we came to the water & we had to go through it. They would not let us get out & walk over the top. We were wet through up to the arm pits & when we got to our posies, outposts, we found them worse than the sap, but we cleaned them out pretty well next day. We were in there for the three days, wet through, but we had plenty of tucker: From there we came back to reserves for a day & then back to Bernafay Wood. We stayed there on a cable laying fatigue every night up to reserves for eight days. Then back to billets Jan 31st to Contalmaison. Sat Feb 3rd Front line at the Butte-de-Warlencourt. It had been snowing for a the few weeks previous & the snow had frozen, I don't know whether you know what that is like, but I can assure you that it is "non bonne". It is about as cold as it is possible to be. Well he saw us coming in and gave us a lively reception with shells & gas. We had to crawl for 400 yds
