 Dear Peters, 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I send you my heartiest congratulations on the award to you of a  Bar to the Military Cross  in recognition of your very good and gallant service in our operations near Bony on 29th September last.&nbsp;  X  With great dash and determination, you led your company across ground swept by intense artillery and machine gun fire, and &quot;mopped-up&quot; two enemy trenches. 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Later, another company was added to your command, and you succeeded in establlishing yourself on the final objective.&nbsp; Through ^  out  you displayed very high qualities of leadership, and by your marked courage and devotion to duty set a splendid example to your men.  X  
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; With kind regards and good wishes, 
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours sincerely, 
 &nbsp; 
 (SIGNED)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W.R.BIRDWOOD. 
 &nbsp; 
 P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; I much regret that it is only now I have received official notification of the Award, otherwise I should have written much earlier. 
 &nbsp;
