<p>Broadmeadows for three days while the Orsova takes a cargo of wheat &amp; more soldiers on board. The Orsova is a beautiful ship &amp; a speedy one too.  It is supposed to steam 18 knots &amp; hour so I am going to back this ship against the submarine if we see one.  All the soldiers are in good knick &amp; seem high spirited if they sight a school of porpoises or a ship they all rush to the sides &amp; sing out &amp; joke about them, in fact they did so when we were in the middle of Church parade this morning much to the disgust of officers &amp; the Parson.  You see the boys are not very religious &amp; most of them never saw a porpoise before.  Well Auntie I will close this now as the Bugle has sounded for tucker &amp; that's a <u>very</u> important event on this ship.  Will write again from Fremantle. With love from your affect nephew<br/>Walter</p>
