<p>seen only one steams since leaving that was to-day at 9am<br/> We were to have gone to Fremantle but received a wireless to proceed to Albany so we are now 24 hours steam from seeing the 1st Aussie Port. We will probably remain there 1 day and we should arrive in Sydney about 2/6/19. Of course we are all excited, but will not say too much because I can quite understand your feelings.<br/>Now old boy I am in the pink of health and all on board  the same. I shall write later so give my kindest regards to all. So with fondest love and hurry up and come home<br/>Bye Bye<br/> Believe me<br/> Your fond loving Brother<br/>Ellis</p>
