Tuesday 15 May 1917.
A little more recovered from the sea sickness & feeling hungry. Went up on deck at 6.30 am 
Rather a rough day today.
Boat drill during morning. 
Our boat right close to the "Encounter" & near the lead.
In the bight now. Back at Mess Orderly duties again with G.S.S.C. (who has acted a dinkum cobber to me while crook with seasickness.)[George Stuart Strathdee Cameron, No 16923, Camel Field Ambulance sailed on the Boorara with Culbert Cecil Fisher.]
Towards afternoon sea rougher
Ran into a storm later & at night it is bitterly cold up on deck.  Band playing down on No 4 deck cheering things up.
Everybody brighter today. Feeling better. Wrote 6 cards afternoon.
(Lost one of E M (?) mittens)
Are now well down in Sthn  Ocean
