 holds fine for this coming week for its the last week that Miss Allen &amp; I will have together for she, her sister &amp; mother are going to Blackpool for a month or so. 
 9th. It has been raining lightly all the morning but not heavy enough to stop us from going to Church which is only a stones throw from the Hospital. 
 After dinner I went into town &amp; had a look at the performance in the Theatre Royal, it was given to the Soldiers, sailors, nurses &amp; etc by the Birmingham Professions &amp; Trades Fund, it was not bad I liked the music best for the orchestra was very large &amp; good they gave a descriptive piece, "A hunting scene" &amp; you could follow it with the music easily.
