<p>Today  Major Webb gave us a lecture but really it is very hard to hear &amp;  doctors are not good lecturers.<br/>Sister Murray, the one Agnes introduced me to, is an awfully nice girl. She is a great favourite among us. She has spent a number of years in W.A. on the Gold-fields nursing. There will be a few engagements, as the result of this trip, so I've been told. Our food has been very good but is getting a bit short, especially the fruit. Hope to get a fresh supply at Colombo. The water is horrible too, only allowed very little for drinking (fresh water). The boat has a terrible roll on, the water &amp; coal getting so low but do not feel at all sick, quite enjoying it. Had boat drill this afternoon, put on life belts &amp; had to get to our stations &ndash; 10.5.15. Oh. dear, I have been awfully sea-sick &ndash; we have had a very rough time but thank goodness at Colombo at last. We expect to go ashore any minute now. Will send P. Cards. Don't show this to anyone, just mention to friends that our letters are censored.</p>
