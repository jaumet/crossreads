<p>equipment &amp; kits eventually find the 4th Div. Base Camp, our objective, allotted tents &amp; afterwards blankets, then look around at 11 a.m. for some tea &amp; breakfast.  No drills or parades to-day &amp; wait for instructions.  A fine Sergeants' mess here, which costs me 2 francs admittance &amp; 4 francs per week.  Have a good lunch &amp; dinner &amp; at 8 p.m. tired out, through walking round in the sand, turn in to a sandy bed.  A cold miserable day, blowing hard, a biting wind, which blows the sand, on which the camp is built, into everything.  First night under canvas for some time but sleep well.</p>
