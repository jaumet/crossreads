<p>Sunday 25 February</p>
<p>Arrived Albert 4 a.m. walked to the Bellevue Farm Rest Camp and found our unit still there.  Rumours current relative to the Germans having fallen back before Bapaume.<br/>While I was away arrangements were made between the Field Cashier &amp; our unit to put me into the 56th Batt. as Pay Sergeant, so I have to go out there tomorrow.</p>
