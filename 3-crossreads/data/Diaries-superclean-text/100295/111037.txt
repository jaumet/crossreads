dugout far away somewhere on the german line. Our batteries of course are hidden by "camouflage" (mimicry coloring and mimicry generally) as much as possible never see the object on which they are firing. This being is all directed from group headquarters (generally a strong dugout), by telephone to the various battery Commanders. Group headquarters which controls a number of batteries, obtains its range direction information from aeroplane photographs maps. The accuracy of their fire is reported by baloon, or plane. Each battery has a small sector for its activity only operates on that sector. The value of aeroplane photography is indispensable. Our machines pay dally visits over the bosh lines, takes these photographs, which are forwarded in very short space of time to the batteries. These photographs, show exactly the results of the fire, battery positions, without these magnificent records, accurate work would be both tedious inefficient. I was much interested
