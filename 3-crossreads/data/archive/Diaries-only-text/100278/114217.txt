it started to snow lightly at first but it soon fell heavily, but it made no difference to us we worked all through it, the ground soon was quite white and the men looked so comical walking about in their snowy dress, but cold as snow is it is much better than rain. 
Tonight I got another parcel this time from Jean Crawford of "Yoorooga". I have been very lucky with parcels lately. I heard today that the 1st and 2nd Div. are in for another hop over in 3 weeks they are making the pace a cracker with our Div. alright. 
The Germans sent a lot of heavy shells over today but none landed near us fortunately. 
20th Very hard frost this morning and the ground was quite white with the snow which had fallen yesterday.
