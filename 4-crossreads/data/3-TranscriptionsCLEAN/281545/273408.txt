From Tuesday until Friday 18/1/18 things were very quiet, very little fireing going on.    We were issued a new Tunic, before lunch & as the sleeves were rather long I took the opperunity being off duty & went into Poperinghe to my friends where the young lady, altered the sleeves & put new Chevons Chevrons (stripes) on my sleeve also made me two new colours & sewed them on.   We expect our Riding Breeches & New Hats any time now.   After spending the Evening with these people I left by a special troop Train at 10 Pm for Camp.
Tuesday 22nd/1/18.   As I was not on duty until 4 Pm I caught a Train at 10 am for Peselhoek to go & have a hot bath & after a good run arrived at Peselhoek at 10.45 am & straight away had by Hot Bath, then I had Dinner & spent a couple of hours with my Pall in his Hut, then I left at 3-15 Pm & arrived in Camp at 4 Pm & straight away signed on & went up to St Jean Yard.  Today Wednesday 23rd turned out to be a fine day & up went our Observation Balloons, which Fritz soon started shelling with Schrapnel also Fritz Machines were continually over for Observations purposes & our Anti Air Craft Guns were kept fairly busy blazing away at them.   This was kept up all day until eventide
