There was a maize of trenches about us, the principal being "Diggers' Supports", "Kent St", "York St", and "Anzalia Switch". Our materials had to be deposited at on the corner of Kent and York Sts. We got lost, found ourselves, got lost again, and some of us had to sit with the stuff whilst others went out exploring. After hours of this misery, a place at last was found somewhere, and so we dumped the lot, and returned to the trenches where we met the ration fatigue coming in with their rifles on one shoulder, and two handy bags, tied together, and slung over the other shoulder. We squeezed into a slit to let them pass. Got back to shelter at dawn. "Stood to" as usual. Was Warned to be ready to go into front line again at 3 P.M. today. Hardly any tucker available. This activity portends a stunt in a day or so. Resumed work this afternoon with four comrades, we being detailed to construct a Regimental Aid Post in the front trench, some of the material for which we had carried down last night. In addition to gear and rifle, I had to carry two 12 feet logs along the "Diggers' Supports" to the corner of "Kent and "York Sts", and suffered extraordinary fatigue
