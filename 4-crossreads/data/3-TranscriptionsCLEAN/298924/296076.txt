  
 Friday 4 April 1919 Cold better & Diary finished. Only doing small rate as coal is bad but hope to arrive at Albany on Tuesday. Later.  We are not going Albany but to Freemantle.  I shall wire for a room to Lavender & Scotts Hotel as being Easter they may all be crowded.  I think I have a good chance of getting off at Melbourne now & the Derbyshire will only be a day & a half ahead of me.
