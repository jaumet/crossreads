exaggeration to say that during the war they Camels were as numerous in Egypt & Palestine as fleas on the bedding of the Bedouin.
In the same place with the camelAt this stage also I must mention the Egyptian labour corps though differing slightly in his mental outlook the Egyptian labourer under proper British supervision kept pace in value with the camel as an all important auxilliary.
The Gypo as we call him is was properly managed clothed fed & very well paid and in a somewhat perfunctory manner he came in for an occasional clout of the gangers whip.  We of the white North already too energetic mentally whip & spur ourselves into greater efforts;  the gypo with his natural indolence prefers his whipping to be done by properly appointed officials.  With the stimulous of songs weird singing perfect unity of action a phisique equalling that of our finest athletes, and the aid of the whip he performed almost miracles of labour.  To see a gang of Gypos shifting a length of broad gauge rails, sleepers and all is to have dispelled the mystery of their early building.  Multiply the effort the railway gangs by a of a railway of a gypo railway gang
