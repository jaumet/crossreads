<p>Sunday 13 May 1917.</p>
<p>My 20th birthday. Woke up seasick at 6 am. A cold wind blowing.</p>
<p>Hail &amp; rain storms at intervals.</p>
<p>Everything bleak &amp; desolate. Nothing in sight but water everywhere.</p>
<p>Boat shipping seas. Very rough weather but boat is riding well. Hope I never spend another birthday like this one. Could not stand down below so had to stay above deck.</p>
<p>Everybody crook with one or two exceptions. Waves bigger than I&#39;ve ever seen before.</p>
<p>Turned in early as I felt very crook.</p>
<p>We have after leaving &quot;the heads&quot; come well down south off Tas. west coast.</p>
<p>Geo. C. looked after me. He was not sea-sick.</p>
