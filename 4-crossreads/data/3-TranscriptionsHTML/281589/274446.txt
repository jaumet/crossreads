<p>Receiving any attention are slowly falling to pieces. There is a Tank about &frac12; a mile away, abandoned. Saturday fine a few big shells came over, Taubes also, Sunday misty, heavy frost , heaviest yet, it looks pretty on the battered trees. There is a tree observation post outside the dug-out (old one) on night duty tonight, pushing trucks, wounded men on board, which run on light railway lines, from A.D.S. to "Villa" Station about 2 miles, we were lucky in getting pulled nearly the whole distance by the motor which uses the line.</p>
<p>Duty from 7PM to 7AM  Monday 12th fine. Tuesday we left Martinpuich at 5.30 AM for A.D.Post, exposed position about 2 miles away, we have to carry during the night, nothing doing to night. Wednesday 14th Feb. still fine, snow is disappearing slowly. The dug out we are in is a good one fair size. Thursday 15 fine still quiet, no call for my squad last night, this last week we have been on shorter rations 1 loaf </p>
