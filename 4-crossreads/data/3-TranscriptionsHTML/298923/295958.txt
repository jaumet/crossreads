<p>19 October 1918 Saturday<br/>Kantara East<br/>Had a good night &amp; much stronger-  Quinine making me a bit deaf-  A boat load passed through Canal with 1944 men from France- rosy cheeked &amp; fresh complexioned so different to the yellow looking fever men from here.  Still hoping to cross the Canal tomorrow but all the Base Hospitals are full.<br/><strike> Got letters from Mother Sept 1st Kathleen Sept 8 &amp; Jack Forth- glad all's well</strike></p>
