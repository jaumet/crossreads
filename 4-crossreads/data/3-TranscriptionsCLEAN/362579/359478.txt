  
 A card from Mrs Newton also the Osbournes. 
 My friends are awfully good thinking of me. Mrs Baynes said she had sent a cake but it has not turned up. Perhaps the fish are enjoying it. 
 I do wish I had been awarded the R.R.C. only to please my friends - they will think I did not do my work as well as the others but really every on of the nurses at our C.C.S. worked as hard as they could   &  only four out of the crowd got it. Dorothy is very lucky   &  she deserved it much more than some who have been decorated
