<p>7 April, 1916<br/>Selhai [Salhia]<br/>There is a horrible rumour afloat to the effect the we are on the camp site of the 1st LH Bde, this after we have got nice &amp; comfortable, our tent right up against the mess room &amp; fixed up with rifle stand,  wash stand &amp; a place for our bandoliers &amp; belts, its too much to say nothing of the work we did  to get our horse lines in order &ndash; if the rumour is true, wont there just be a roar from the 2nd LHB ? it will surely cause a heat wave.  They are deucedly long winded with their pay days recently.  I wish they would pay, its rotten to be broke.  Im on picquet to night &amp; have drawn 3rd shift, will have to turn out at three in the morning</p>
