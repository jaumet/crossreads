I haven't succeeded yet in finding out where Wally is but I have several enquiries going & expect to hear anyday now.  As soon as I am able to get out I will go round & see for myself how he is getting onIt is a great relief to me to realise that I have the appendix out at last   The operating doctor (Major Stout) from New Zealand made an excellent job of it, & in 12 months time, even though it is a 6 inch horizontal cut, there will scarcely be any sign of a scar.I am hoping to be back in the line in about a month or 6 weeks time from now, but being Military, have to do what I am toldI sincerely trust you are all keeping well at home, & not finding the summer too tryingWith love to you all at home,Your loving sonLeo.
