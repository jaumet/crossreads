  
 Now to try & give you what little news there is to give. The winter is getting nearer the end across here now only a couple of months & we are through with it. It has been very mild up to the present & now the days are drawing out & the sun is getting a bit of warmth in it. This is rather a cold windy month but has started fairly well. We had a fall of snow last night but it has nearly all melted away now  It hasent been at all bad nice & warm in the sun but the wind would go through you received a withdrawal form from the Savings Bank yesterday to be filled in for  25 they had paid into my credit with the commonwealth Bank London  Have signed it & returned. But am wondering now if they have sent a second  25 as you said they wouldent transfer money on account of my not making arrangements before leaving. Havent been notified of a second lot to conclude they have stretched a point & sent the  25. It has been very handy too with this spell I have had in England. I bought myself a decent uniform while on leave the last time & left it with Harry Cross's wife so I shall have it if I happened to get across here wounded again. Thought it a good investment while I had the money one likes to look decent while on leave. Our uniform certainly looks very well if it fits but a fit me quick well they make you feel  (4)
