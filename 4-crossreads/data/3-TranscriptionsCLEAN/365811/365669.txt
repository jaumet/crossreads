Hdqrs.[Des-Nrd] Corps17.1.18
My dear Judge,I have received two letters from you in the last 10 days - one dated Sept & one late in Octr. Very many thanks for both & for cable forms you send. The Alexandria office have advised me that they will despatch them when received & I have already sent one.
With the letters I also received a parcel from you of cigars & butter scotch. I am more than grateful for them. It was awfully good of you & in both instances of the contents you got me on the strongest of my likes. Incidental to being attached to a Corp's Hdqrs, one enjoys at present the luxury of living in a house, sleeping on a bed & eating at a table. To be able to smoke a good cigar after dinner is the acme of luxury & makes the war fade into nothing.
We are having a particularly easy time just at present & life is good - we're living like kings. The country is looking beautiful - green everywhere with poppies, narcissi, lilies & other colours of various hue, just coming into flow. I have never seen any such opportunities for artistic talent as this country & these villages present.
We have the official photographer up here just now (Hurley) - he should do great things
