<p>3/3/17<br/>Being exceedingly tired turned in and rested in a fashion until 3 pm.  Then went out and did some shopping and found prices reasonable.  Bought two guide books. English is spoken in a great many of the shops.  Fine streets full of bustling crowds, not many British but many other soldiers including Russians.  A feature of the streets is the newspaper kiosk which is everywhere, extremely convenient and does away with noisy newsvendors.  Had a look at the Opera House &ndash; a fine place rather over decorated with statuary.  It has a good square in front of it where numbers of streets converge.  Also saw the Place de Vendome, a quiet square with quiet shops round it.  The monument in the centre has a laurel wreathed figure (Napoleon?) on it.</p>
<p>Shews statements about latrine publicity were quite true, men complete arranging their wardrobe as they walk along.  There seemed to be some very fine glove shops about. Returning to Hotel met Mrs Eckelstein who asked me to dine with her.  Big char-a-bancs (much resembling) tanks charge about the streets.  Traffic is less well managed to what it is in London and there is a full [indecipherable] of excitement in negotiating street crossings.  Again &ndash; the Paris cabby is the dirty limit</p>
