4/1/17 Toiled hard in the small hours with maps and plans doing Disposition 
Reports for Brigade and Division. Finished with a tired mind about 3 pm and devoured bread and cheese and "Three Weeks". At 4 Groves came in and collated Intelligence reports ? one has constantly to guard against the enthusiastic specialist and exaggeration. The machine gunner who fires on a working party always "mows them down". One of our Vickers claimed 25! A burst of 50 cartridges did this. Turned in about 6 and slept till 9 when General M Smythe G.O.C. 2ND Division came in from tour "round the line". A practised eye at once saw not much mud on his puttees so some of his leading questions fell on stony ground. At 11 set out for the trenches but was stopped at the door by an order to accommodate 60 more men up here. Devil a shelter and plenty of rain. Went round with Ped. And managed to fit in a good many of them and with some iron and a few duckboards hoped to get them sheltered later on
