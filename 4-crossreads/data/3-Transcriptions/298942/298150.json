<p>Saturday 18 May</p>
<p>The principal events of the past three days have been in the shape of extra work &amp; increased heat, &amp; these are bound up in each other.</p>
<p>The weather has suddenly become warmer then hot.  One wakes up after a heavy dead<br/> sleep, (which the northern warmth always brings &amp; not the Australian heat) to promise of a hot day in the warm haze.  Unusual heat in the morning &amp; midday keeps ones mind occupied with the thought of the discomfort</p>
