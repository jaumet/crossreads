9/5/18 Querrieu
A lovely sunny day. No work doing as all preparations had to be made for going up the line. Packs and blankets had to be dumped and soon every hat had been exchanged for the steel helmet. The place is full of changing troops ? a mixture of units of all kinds. Motor transport ? tractors, lorries, guns passing and re-passing along the road. I went down to the Chateau and saw the General. They had arranged for an aeroplane to come over and pick up their ground signals done with a signalling sheet. After lunch had a conference of a few officers on the writing of Operations Orders. Went round the billets and inspected them. It was a hot afternoon and the men felt the heat as they moved off laden with 220 rounds SAA 2 bombs in addition the to their other gear. The platoons were at 100 yards interval and Matthews took charge at the head of the column. I passed up the column after we passed through Pont Noyelles and did a canter across country. Just as the column was about to enter La Houssoye the enemy put over about 10 shells and killed and wounded a few people there. Our column made a detour struck off overland towards Heilly. The black burst of crumps of shrapnel was plainly to be seen from there. Rode up to Franvillers and had a look round our billets. Some Americans here
