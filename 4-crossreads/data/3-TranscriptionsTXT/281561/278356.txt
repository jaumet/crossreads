6/1/17.Very cold day. Were releived and went out via Delville Wood and Langueval to "Brisbane Camp" near Bazentin; or what is left of it. Will camp here for the night in Bow Huts. The slush was freezing underfoot today.7/1/17.Saw Roy Lennon today, where he was working on the stone dump I must have been unutterably filthy for even he remarked that I had some mud on myself. Left "Brisbane Camp" and got a ride on a train as far as Meaulte; then we marched beside the Ancre as far as Ribemont. Went into good billets. Not a bad village this. Went to the bathhouse, and had a good bath and a change. Wonderfully refreshing makes one feel like a little rainwashed daisy.
