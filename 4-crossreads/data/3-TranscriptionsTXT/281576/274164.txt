 Thur. 7.  Last night we had a fire in the Tent which made things much warmer.  Break. was very light.  The M.O. came round about 11.30.  Told him I was well enough to rejoin my unit, if only I could get a pair of Boots &amp; a few other articles of attire, so he told the Orderly to attend to it.  After Dinner went to Q.M.
