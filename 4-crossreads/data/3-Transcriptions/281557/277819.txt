<p>attended physical drill class after tea</p>
<p>Thursday Jan 6th<br/>A very calm day : hot : Revellie 6 am : mess orderly all day : had my wrist painted &amp; it is a lot better : our Coy on guard so we had no after tea physical drill class. This made our second time on guard since coming on board. Boxing tournament continued &amp; more willing bouts : slept on deck but rained toward midnight &amp; got damp a bit : but that is better than being packed</p>
