<p>6 October 1915<br/>Wednesday</p>
<p>First thing this morning I was warned for Al Hayat Helouan Convalescent Hosp.<br/>Pay a flying visit to dad to let him know  &amp;  to get some more gear.</p>
<p>1915 October 7<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>The journey out was very interesting first 1 hour tram from Mena to Bab-el-louk station   &amp;  then 1 hour in a very slow train from Bab-el-louk to Helouan, 10 mins march to El Hayat.<br/>It is a very big concern several Hundred Australians are housed here but too much like a prison.</p>
