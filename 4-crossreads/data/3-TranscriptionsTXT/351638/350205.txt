 The positions occupied by the Australian and New Zealand Amy Corps on the cliffs north of Gaba Tepe remain practically the same to-day as when I last visited them some six weeks ago. The area of ground occupied   has not been materially extended  except along the sea shore towards the north were an advanced post has been thrown out some two thousand yards connected with the main position by a deep trench dug  out of the sand along the foreshore. But the interior of the position would hardly be recognised now by those who knew it after the first landing three monhs ago.  Everything has in fact changed. I suppose it is necessary to use once again the word 'consolidated' for this is what the Colonials have been working at ever since and if ever everything possible has been to render a position both comfortable and secure it is surely at Anzac.
