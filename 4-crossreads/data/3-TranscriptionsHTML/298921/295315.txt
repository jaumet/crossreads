<p>4<br/>[indecipherable] Hospital<br/>22 December Wednesday  6<br/>Hear we are off to Egypt in a day or two to join our Horses &ndash; as you see below over 10 bags Mail here &ndash; came so 2 Australians came from Mother - Letters from Percy Smith May &ndash; Walter Campbell &ndash; Embarked at 2 p.m. on the Ioman for Egypt &ndash; wet muddy &amp; tired but with a feeling of thankfulness at being alive &ndash; now if we can dodge the submarines we are right, for a while. The Boat is crammed with troops <strike>X &amp; unfortunately there is a good deal of feeling between the English &amp; Colonial officers &ndash; certainly we have many Scrubbers, but among the Tommy officers are many snobs and nincompopes &ndash; the real man is easily picked out. Sounds small etc.</strike></p>
