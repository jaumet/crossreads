Shelter Wood, Beaucamps-le-Vieux, Amiens
5/2/17 An interesting day. At 9.45 am proceeded to D.H.Q. and there met G.S.O.1. Col. Bridges and message came through giving Details of 4th Dvn. attack which succeeded. Walked down to Fricourt Circus and picked up Col. Leane D.S.O. M.C. and got into a fine motor car and picked up Col. Mullins in Albert. Albert was quiet and well strafed cemetery knocked about and one house flattened with one yesterday. Got on to the main Amiens road and the cold soon got almost unbearable and powdery snow falling forced us to put the hood up. We seemed to run into an area where more snow had been falling as it was much deeper there than elsewhere. Coming to Amiens and passing the usual barriers we spun round the town and struck out through bare snow covered country with roads flanked with guant trees, - stray partridges and other birds in the fields and the usual frequent villages with their tortuous streets and blank walls. Swung into one rather larger place and there ordered sardines (frozen) hot coffee and omelette and did well. Cheerful folk with warm stoves. They were much taken with "Jolie casquette" ? evidently a novelty to them as this place is off the beaten track for troops
