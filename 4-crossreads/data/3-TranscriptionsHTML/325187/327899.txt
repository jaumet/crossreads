<p>[Monday 5 June 1916]<br/> [Following paragraphs are crossed out]<br/>I notice a lot of hot air Talk about settling return soldiers etc and anticipation of teaching them How to Cook on a "good" stove.<br/>I think the average soldier only wants peace &amp; quiet in his own congenial surroundings.<br/>We are getting some extra Tucker for the men from the Canal, but the looting is as bad as Gallipoli.</p>
<p>We are gathering in all the Bedouins &amp; their flocks   One little homeless 12 year old, was brought in with 10 goats.  She would not leave them &amp; the boys gathered round &amp; gave her biscuits Tea &amp; Bully &amp; would not allow a goat to be Killed.  Later she went on to the concentration camp with 50 Piastre for each goat.</p>
