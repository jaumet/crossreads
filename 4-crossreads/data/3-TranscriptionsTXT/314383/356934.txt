under a Cavalry officer at dawn with Scotty as guide to see if Nicol's body could be brought in but on coming into action with a party of the enemy the cavalry officer retired much to Scotty's disgust.  We got the people clear of the gorge & camped near San Jud, which was now in ruins, destroyed by the Christians, with many of the inhabitants murdered.    I will never forget the horrors of that day.  The bulk of the Armenian & Syrian men had ridden ahead deserting their wives & families.  The wounded women, the aged & weak children dropped by the wayside, not able to go another inch, calling on us to save their lives. We dismounted & got them up on our horses & mules yet hundreds had to be abandoned
