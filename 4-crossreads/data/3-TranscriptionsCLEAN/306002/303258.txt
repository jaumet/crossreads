Les Smithers was grazed on the back of the hand by a piece of shell the morning of the charge & it put a nasty cut in one finger which does not appear to be healing too well & today he is very bad with dysentery & had to go off duty to-day, so Penny & I have to take the 'phone on our own to-night.  Sergeant-Major Kirby was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant about a week ago, & he is panning out a very good officer & was in charge of Hintons Post here last night.  9 men & 1 officer is all that is holding this outpost during the night & 6 men & 1 N.C.O. during the day, we would get some "hurry up" if the Turks charged us, as it would be impossible to retreat.
