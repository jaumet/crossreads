May 1917.2nd   Although the temperature is not much above 40, we feel it very hot, due to the excissive cold we have had during the winter.   Our work was resumed again with the Bosches to-day & we are making fine progress.This afternoon the whole section with the exception of two, went down to the photographer in the town & had a group taken, after which Mr. Oliver left us & returned to Mametz.3rd.   We have made good progress with our work & have started various new ones.  We are enjoying ourselves immensely here & are welcome at all the French houses in the town.   To-night we "found" a billiard table & were invited to have a game whenever we felt inclined.
