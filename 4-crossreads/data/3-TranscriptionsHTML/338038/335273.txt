<p>day, and send me papers etc  This morning they forwarded me your letters of 18th Sept to them, which are a fortnight later than any I had from you in France.</p>
<p>This mornings paper reports the loss of the Arabia in the Mediterranean with Australian mails aboard, so I expect we are doomed to disappointment again next week.</p>
<p>This will go by Xmas mail so I will give you my very best Xmas wishes. My third Xmas away from home and I sincerely hope the last.</p>
<p>With all my love to your dear selves and the Brother</p>
<p>Your affectionate Son<br/>Terence W. Garling</p>
