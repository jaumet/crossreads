 Saturday 23 Sept. 1916 Another perfect day. Busy with the new respirator in the morning, &amp; then went over to Reninghelst for a bath. In the afternoon the 2nd Bn. sports were held in the Gas School grounds &amp; attended by most of the brigade. The grounds were very well set out, abundance of refreshments were supplied, &amp; altogether the function was very successful. Unfortunately I arrived just too late for the officers' race in which I was to have run. Col. Heane presented the money prizes at the conclusion. After the sports a grand dinner was given, attended by General Walker &amp; other notables. Also a highly successful function.
