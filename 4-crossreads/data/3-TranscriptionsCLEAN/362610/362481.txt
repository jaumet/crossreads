  
 Friday 22 Sept. 1916 A glorious day, all aircraft taking advantage of the good visibility. A Hun came along way back over our lines amid a storm of shrapnel, & some of our planes visited the German lines. The remainder of the bde. staff were up the line & elsewhere & I had to remain in after going round to Division to draw pay. Lectured to the Gas N.C.O.s in the afternoon & was also able to put in a fair amount of time letter-writing.
