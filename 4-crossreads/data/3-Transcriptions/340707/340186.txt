<p>1) am not getting enough</p>
<p>9-7-19<br/>I have been invited to Volney Club 7 Rue Volney to night as the guest of M. Dolleans &amp; meet quite a nice number of peoples. Dinner as usual is good 2 wines, Soup, Fish, Meat, Jalousie, liqueur &amp; coffee &amp; all for 11 fr. Ordinary meal is 7 fr</p>
<p>After there is a pleasant concert &amp; the girl who has gained the highest prize at Conservatoire this week plays on piano &ndash; a wonderful exhibition.</p>
<p>The Frenchmen here are very interesting being the first Australian to be entertained by Club I am treated as a little hero &amp; treated to champagne etc. &amp; introduced to lady singers. Upstair I visited the gaming rooms. All French clubs are kept going by the gambling clique &amp; play is always very high.</p>
<p>I go home with [indecipherable] &amp; Dolleans promises to put me up as a non resident member but I do not accept for the present as I must consider expenses.</p>
<p>10-7-19<br/>From this date till 27-7-19 I have not written up anything and as in this period there was the French celebration of peace &amp; national fete trip to Eng &amp; peace celebrations there followed by a return &amp; change of residence.</p>
