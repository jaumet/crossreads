 During our stay the Fiji Banana Company thoughtfully presented some hundreds of branches of bananas to the ship's company, which was a greatly appreciated gift. It now appears that after we left Samoa the German Governor & his Staff, with the manager of the Apia Wireless Station, were taken prisoners & brought to  Suva  on board the "Pyramus". They were to remain in the Grand Pacific Hotel for the present.  
 Sept. 4. 
 The following Friday morning we left Suva for Rossel Island, a small island situated off the South East corner of New Guinea. Our course led us through the New Hebrides group. 
 Sept.6.             
 In these islands were several active volcanoes which lazily smoked & cast a dismal pall over the surrounding land. The atmosphere here was hot, heavy, & damp. It is scarcely two months ago since the sloop "Torch" was up in Malekula (New Hebrides) on a punitive expedition. A tribe had eaten a few missionaries, which seems to be a favourite pastime in these islands. Three days later we arrived at Rossel Island where we found the "Sydney", 3 destroyers, 2 submarines, 2 transports, & 2 colliers, waiting for us. One transport brought mails for us, which were the first letters we had had since leaving Sydney 6 weeks previously & was, therefore, welcomed with huge delight. Without delay we pushed on to Simpsonhafen, New Britain, which was reached at 7 a.m. on Friday in glorious weather. 
 Sept. 11.  There is a very fine harbour here, with deep water everywhere.
