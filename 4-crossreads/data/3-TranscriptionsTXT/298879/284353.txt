March - April 1915Wednesday 31Last night was very hot. Hope to go down to the lines & draw a few of the quidlets that are due to me by now. There are a large number of sick men in the camp & hospital from the various Regiments. The men are sick of this hanging around & have no enthusiasm what-ever. They want "fight", what they volunteered for & I am with them.
Thursday April 1Left hospital today. Feel very week. Batt out on Divisional manoeuvres. They left at about 8 AM. & are to return about 4 PM
