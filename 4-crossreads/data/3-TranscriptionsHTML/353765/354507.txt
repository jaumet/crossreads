Amb Started Dugouts<br/>[Note in margin:] Italy declared War<br/>24th &ndash; Digging our dug-outs in new position. Armistice to bury dead arranged between Austns &amp; Turks. from 9am to 4pm. Visited trenches about noon Gruesome sight. Hundreds of bodies Turks 12 to 1 lying about unburied. Cartridges &amp; equipment galore. Some found with trench tools in hand having started dugouts when bowled over. Capt Robinson told me they had found Lieut Roberts' (Alf's cousin <strike>brother</strike>) body. All or most of Austns buried, estimated about 2500 or 3000 Turks dead. Hills took wind out of us, climbing them seemed impossible to charge up. Top like plateau &amp; Austns scattered over it killed whilst charging, some riddled with bullets, skulls perforated. Sleeping in dugout with Miles &amp; Wiggins. Sniping after armistice over. Austns in splendid &amp; almost impregnable positions. Seems as if big movements of troops pending. Rumoured big fort (supposed Kilid Bahr)</p>
