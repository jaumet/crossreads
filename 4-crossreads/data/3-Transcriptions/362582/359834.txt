<p>3rd A.C.C.S. A.G.H. France 26.4.17<br/>My dear Jane, I do hope you will get this before your birthday. Many Happy Returns of the Day &amp; I hope you get plenty of presents &amp; I hope you get plenty of presents &amp; heaps of Good-Luck &amp; joy, also that I shall be home for your next. We are still fairly quiet &amp; the weather is much improved, so our staff is feeling much happier. We are still in the same position &amp; think shall remain so for some time. Things are to be very, very busy here in a few days. Hope it will be the last for our Boys. Somehow I don't think I shall be allowed to stay here much longer, so many others want to get here &amp; I've done 6 months. I shall be awfully sorry to leave here. We are getting very comfortable</p>
