<p>"Waterhouse, Chatswood, Transfer account bank New South Wales London, Jabez Waterhouse."  This will save me spending 15/- or 17/6 on a cable every time I want money sent out.<br/>I am working till about 6.30 every evening now &amp; even then I am not left in peace.  One night last week, as soon as I finished tea I turned into bed (about 8.30 pm) as I was dog-tired.  About 11.30 I was awakened by a civilian who was looking for the M.O.  It turned out that one of our fellows staying at a 6th rate boarding house at the Elephant &amp; Castle had been asphixiated &amp; was in great danger.  I at once rang up for an Ambulance, &amp; the Medical Officer &amp; I went out to him.  He was indeed in a bad way &amp; it was with difficulty we got him down<strike>star</strike> about 4 flights of stairs to the Ambulance.  Then we took him to King George's Hospital at Waterloo.  We reached home again at &frac14; to 2.<br/>On Sunday night we had two calls one at 10, &amp; again at &frac14; past 12, both bad cases.  As I write there is a man dangerously ill at Lambeth wherever that is; I have rung up the Garage for an Ambulance &amp; am now waiting for the M.O. to come in.<br/>That <strike>is</strike> work falls exclusively to me- taking men to Hospital once I had to take a man to Harefield about 18 miles out, but they are nearly all to local Military Hospitals.  It is astonishing the C.S.M. (cerebo-spinal meningitis) &amp; C.S.F (c.-s- fever) there are about.<br/>Since last Sunday I have had 7 cases (thats in 4 days, 6 of the former &amp; one of the latter).  I am always a bit scared at handling these fellows: one case we had to strap to the stretcher &amp; ambulance as he was so violent.</p>
