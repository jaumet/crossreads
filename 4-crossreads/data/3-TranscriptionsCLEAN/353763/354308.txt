  
 Encounter which as I mentioned is Guard Ship & we take all our orders from her  -  There has been some hitch over AE2 on the slip  -  She wont go up it which means trouble & delay  -  AE2's displacement is 800 tons when her tanks are full  -  There is a talk in Naval papers of a Super Submarine - a real submarine cruiser with disappearing guns & other new features  -  Jellicoe however bases his strategy & tactics on gun fire, using Submarines only from a base - with Submarines at sea to sink the parent ship is the game for then the submarine must come up & be captured or sunk  - 
 I've been studying the AMJ & reading the address on physiology  -  The medical side of the Navy does not attract me  -  There's absolutely no scope  -  On my ship the Upolu with Naval ratings I've nothing much to do - all my men are picked men - while on the Aorangi with any ordinary sailor man there is a bit to do  -  Pick your men at your base & bar a naval engagement & with a thousand men all told, your billet is a sinecure -
