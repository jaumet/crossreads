<p>Horse had sapped out about 60 yards &amp; had opened up a new firing line during the night, the next night they made a pretty determined bomb attack on them but they were beaten off easily we took a hand in this for we put a cross fire on to them, things were pretty hot for a while, the rifle &amp; machine gun fire being especially severe the disturbance lasted about 30 mins. &amp; they then threw it up, we got 19 of their dead in &amp; about 17 wounded next morning one of our stretcher bearers done a risky thing there was a wounded Turk out in the open, &amp; he hopped over the parapet &amp; fetched him in, a plucky act</p>
