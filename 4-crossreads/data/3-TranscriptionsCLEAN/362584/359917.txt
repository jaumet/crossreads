  
 was his relief to see him sit up - one poor fellow was killed outright, all the others on the gun were wounded - a shell burst about 6 yds away from them, was'nt  it a miraculous escape for them - Willie said they got Jack on a stretcher & carried him back. They did not know whether the leg was broken or not - after getting rid of Jack, Willie went back & lowered the gun & fired it, when some one took him away - he was wounded in the upper right arm & side - he said he was sorry to go because they were "having the time of their lives" never before had they seen their shells hit their mark - he said the Germans came on in four waves, & then they began to ease off before our gunners & gradually they retreated. 
 The news is not very good just now - I do wish that the tide would turn in our favour, we must have patience I suppose. 
 With kindest regards to yourself & Miss Ferguson & many thanks for wire 
 I am 
 Yours very sincerely Jn E Hunter
