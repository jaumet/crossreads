  
 4.  will be a sudden end to times together & will be hard to get used to & one does not know when it is all to end: there is a lot of talk here about our troops being moved to France soon & if that is so of course he will go with them.  Still it is no use trying to look into the future. 22.2.16  Must close this darling People.  No more news yet about Rid moving off to Tel-el-Keber, we are still hanging on from day to day, it seems too good to be true this lovely little time together, and this afternoon we have had Wal with us & have had a great time.  He is still here with us for another hour or so; this afternoon we have been tramping round amongst the native streets, in the bazaars & such like places & it is all most intensely interesting though the squalor & muddle of their life disgusts me fearfully; then we had an immense afternoon tea together at a stylish cafe- six cakes each only I got stuck at the fifth & had to palm it off on to Wal the remaining one I mean.  I should have told you we had ices together first before starting out on our hour, we get reckless when we all get together & start doing things in style. So very much love to you, you dear patient-waiting-at-home People     Your loving daughter Olive.
