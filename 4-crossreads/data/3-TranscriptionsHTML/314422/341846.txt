<p>Monday Jan 21. 1918. 1267.</p>
<p>9th day of my leave. There is a fair at Pettigo and I went to it by train. It was a cattle and pig fare. There was a lot of stuff there and the buyers went around and did the best business they could with the owners. I saw the Martins at the Fare and went home with them in the afternoon. Some young fellowers called in at night on the way home from the fare and they held an impromptue dance. I was too tired to enjoy it.<br/>Tuesday Jan 23. 1918.<br/>1268. <u10 day of leave,</p>
