  
 France 30/1/18 My dear May  Just a P.C. to let you know I am still going strong over this side of the Globe. I am sending you this card so as to give you an idea of what the Amiens cathedral is like. I was in the city about a fortnight ago and the Hun has put three shells through it but is badly damaged as he shelled it very heavy and bombed it a treat, but the civil population is coming back in thousands now. Trusting you all are well as this scrawl leaves me OK I remain your loving Uncle Clarence
