 1st Feb. 
 Dear Mother 
 I&nbsp;did not finish this off the other day and now I have lobbed back in the old hospital again. Got a bit of a cold and they are so frightened of that Spanish fleu, they sent me straight out here yesterday morning - i.e. 14th A.G.H. now at Abbassieh again. Tis afternoon my cold is just about gone so I dont suppose I&#39;ll stop here long. Hope not any way. There is great talk of the 1st bde starting home in the next few weeks, but they also seem to be sending every man in hospital home - even if he has only got a scratched finger - so things look hopeful. I have arranged to meet Alan at that Weather Bureau on the Show Ground about Easter time &amp; I think I&#39;ll be able to keep my appointment, but he&#39;ll Alan have to go to keep his. A mail came in yesterday and I got a letter from Aunt Katie about 8th Dec but I did not receive any home ones before I left HQ. However if there are any I think Jim Ayre will bring them out to me this evening so I&#39;ll wait a bit and see

 No more mail yet Mother so I&#39;ll let this scrap go. All our letters are fumigated before leaving here, so this wont carry any germs! Love to Father &amp; Fred &amp; yourself. I am 
 Your loving son Robert C. Wilson
