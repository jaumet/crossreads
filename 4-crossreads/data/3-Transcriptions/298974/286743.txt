<p>10<br/>There wasn't much work to be done on the trip across the Indian Ocean. They gave us a good many parades, but otherwise <strike>they gave us</strike> there was little excep occasional picket &amp; fatigue party work. However I was snared for 3 weeks work in the isolation ward below decks. It was disagreeable work, and during the day time I had little or no time on deck.</p>
<p>We turned into the Gulf of Aden on the 5th August. Here we met the only Monsoonal weather of the whole trip, and it nearly blew the boat out of the water.
