<p>c/o Australian Offices London 17/11/15<br/>Dear Mother,<br/>I got 29 letters in a bunch at the office about 5 from everyone.  Have got an extension of Furlough for a week.  I had plenty of money   &amp; went to stay a few days with Aunt Bell   &amp; Marny who were very good to me   &amp; Aunt Bell would give me 5 pounds when I was leaving.  As you know by last letter I am on Home Service   &amp; may go back to Australia for a while.  Am quite alright but a bit weak in the leg after a days walking.  Had a splendid week at Killarney Lakes   &amp; also at Giants Causeway near Port Rush.  Heard Miss Hamilton Mays friend had come over to Guy's Hospital  but when I called the other day she had not yet arrived there.  I have written fairly often   &amp; was sorry to see you were apparently rather worried about me</p>
