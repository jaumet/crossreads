Monday 3 January, 1916
Went out to Pieta in the afternoon & had a good time. Left early & went to the Olympia Club & met a Marine Corporal named Baseby. We had a good few drinks & a game of billiards. After that they asked me to stay out of camp overnight so we went across the grand harbour in a dicer but I could not get a bed so I had to make my way back to camp, about 6 miles & across two harbours. I eventually arrived home safely at about 12.30.
