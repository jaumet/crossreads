<p>working of the "dough dividing" and moulding machines, the 4th   &amp; 5th A.I.F. Bakeries were amalgamated as far as bakehouse duties were concerned, and was allotted 1/3rd of the number of ovens of the bakery i.e. 8 ovens or 16 plates, each plates capacity being 160 2lb loaves. Previous to this date, as will have been noticed, 19 N.C.O's and men comprised 1 shift, and with the addition of the Master Baker of the company, made a total of 58 for 3 shifts. This Section worked 4 ovens or eight plates, and used the Raine machinery for "dividing" and "moulding". The capacity of 4 ovens is 1280 loaves, and the dividing machine put this amount of dough through in about 25 minutes, So at the Raine speed the capacity of 8 ovens or 16 plates, i.e. 2560 loaves, would take about 50 minutes to divide and mould. Under the new arrangements, it is necessary to have a total of 30 N.C.O's and men in each shift, and these men work 8 ovens or 16 plates, or 1/3rd of the bakery plant.</p>
