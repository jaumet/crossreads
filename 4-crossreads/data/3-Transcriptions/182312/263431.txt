<p><u>10th August, 1916.</u></p>
<p>From Albert the road to the firing line leads over the hill at the</p>
<p>back of the town and thence through Becourt Wood on the outskirts</p>
<p>of which are the old British front line trenches - the trenches</p>
<p>held by us prior to the commencement of the attack on 1st. July.</p>
<p>Becourt Wood has not seen any fighting to speak of, with the</p>
<p>exception of the few shells which come over every day searching for</p>
<p>gun positions, horse lines etc., and is therefore recognisable as a</p>
<p>wood, which cannot be said of some of the more famous Woods.&nbsp; From</p>
<p>now on we are on terrain captured from the Germans during the</p>
<p>present offensive.&nbsp; The first thing of interest is perhaps the</p>
<p>German front line system.&nbsp; Despite the seven days bombardment of</p>
<p>this system which preceeded our attack, the trenches, and more</p>
<p>particularly the dugouts, are in a very fair state of preservation.</p>
<p>The ample dugouts are quite capable of holding all the men the</p>
<p>Germans would be likely to have maning the front line system and</p>
<p>how difficult it is to root them out has been told again and again.</p>
<p>I climbed down into one of the dugouts and despite all I had heard</p>
<p>of their strength and roominess, they were a surprise and revelaton</p>
<p>to me.&nbsp; The entrance was from the bottom of the trench (which would</p>
<p>be 9 or 10 feet below the top of the parapet) down a flight of</p>
<p>about 15 steep steps.&nbsp; You were then in a chamber in which you could</p>
<p>stand up and as you were probably them from 25 to 30 feet below the</p>
<p>top of the parapet, it was easy to realise how safe it would be there</p>
<p>against the most furious bombardment.&nbsp; The roof and sides were</p>
<p>stayed up with heavy timber such as is used in a coal mine and one</p>
<p>chamber leads into another forming a series which could shelter</p>
<p>probably 200 men.&nbsp; Other exits are provided so as to facilitate the</p>
