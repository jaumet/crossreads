  
 German helmets, watches or anything we might wish to collect as a souvenir, as the articles would in all probability be connected with a "mine". 
 I took up my position right against the wall, under a manger, I seemed to feel safer there, rather than in the centre of the stable.  There was a homely and cheerful smell about the place, of cows.  I failed to get any sleep the first night, I kept wondering why these buildings had been left untouched.  Was very glad when morning arrived, and I found myself still alive.  Did not go out much during the day as "he" could see anyone passing through the gates. 
 A very fine new, guards helmet was hanging on the wall of this stable, very tempting as a souvenir, but we simply looked at but never touched it.  A piece of new deal wood was lying in the yard, just the thing for lighting the brazier, but we just gazed on it and passed on.  Fritz was not going to "get" us that way. 
 The wells of water which had not already "caved" in, were not fit to drink, apparently having been poisoned.  One well however remained, which was pronounced as "safe", and we would obtain our supplies from there, until one day, a few fellows were there and one of them seeing a loose end of wire, and thinking that it would trip someone up, gave a pull at it, result, none of the fellows were seen again, and the well "fell in".  That bit of wire had been attached to a mine.  It's very often so in this world is'nt it, you try to save trouble to others and come to grief yourself. 
 One night - the 29th. March '17, I remember the date very well at about eight o'clock, we left Vauxl, went down the hill from the buildings we occupied, past the very fine German cemetery, towards the enemy front line.  It was very dark, our march was "in silence", no smoking allowed, spoke only in whispers, picked the softest ground possible, till we arrived at a certain place where it had been decided to dig a new set of trenches. 
 The officers "marked out" the portions of ground for each man to dig, and then "set to" and dug fast as we could.  Only a very few spades
