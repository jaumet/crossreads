Stayed in bed until after 10 a.m. and then went round for a walk. The village full of DHQ troops and of French soldiers. After lunch went round to C. D. Coys. As usual we are well messed up about trench shelters. Went and saw the General and put the acid on him about several matters. All the officers came to mess dinner and we managed to fit into two rooms out of which we shall have to shift tomorrow. Quite a lot of new ones among them of late. A nice quiet evening. Now and then an enormous French gun (13 inch) fires at a German railhead 19 miles away and its shell hurtles a terrific distance up into the air during its passage. Went to Bde H.Q. 9 pm and had a talk to the Brigade Major. Colonels James Duggan Ralston (MG) soon came along and we started a conference at
