<p>A rather curious sight is the things he sends up at our planes of a night when they are crossing the line. They look like strings of Fireballs. I have often  noticed them but never found out what they are. Called "Flaming Onions"</p>
<p>19.6   Have to be very Brief. Very little space left.<br/>23rd  G.L  to M W. to W.S./ L to Clare<br/>25/6  I have heard that the plane that visited us on the Night of the 23rd was brought down the same night by a couple of ours. This is a new idea, fighting by night, and is probably due to the fact that the Searchlights are not very efficient on moonlight nights. We shall soon have aeroplane escorts for dumps on moonlight nights I suppose.</p>
<p>27.6   R.T.O.s Bulldog Killed Kitty. Troops despondent.</p>
<p>Made the acquaintance of one of the R.E. Special Coys (Z) today, they have the job of pelting Fritz with Gas bombs by means of  Trench mortar which throws the bombs 2000 yds. The 108th &amp; 56th U.S. Engrs are good customers of ours. The 108 gives a concert tonight at Bertangles aerodrome.</p>

<p>1.7.18 Fritz bombed around here again last night, also Villers-Bocage. There were some civvies, soldiers &amp; kiddies knocked at the latter place. Our aeroplanes attacked the raiders. I could see the tracer Bullets darting from the darkness at the Fritz's, while the searchlights held him. The Antis as usual threw shells all over the sky with no result. Fine weather still continues.</p>
