<p>explained to them.</p>
<p>We spent four days and lived like lords the whole time, making friends with the inhabitants and having a &quot;right royal&quot; time.&nbsp; Another lorry was sent to pick us up, after we had wired our position.</p>
<p>We arrived a day or so later at a very nice but not too safe camp at</p>
<p><u>SCHERPENBERG</u>.</p>
<p>Shells were continuously passing over us, but at night things got a bit exciting.&nbsp; This camp was in the shelter of a hill, huts and everything as comfortable as could be expected.&nbsp; Stay here for about three weeks then move to a pleasant village not far from Bailleul.</p>
<p><u>MERRIS</u>, peaceful and quiet.</p>
<p>We arrive here during the first few days of March &#39; 18, and it is about three weeks later when all leave is cancelled and those on the way to England are returned.&nbsp; A big &quot;push&quot; is expected by the enemy, and everything is very exciting.</p>
<p>A sudden order is issued that we are to be ready to move at a moments notice, and to only take what is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The order materialises on about the 23rd. of the month, when we move at a few minutes notice, in busses, lorries or any other conveyance procurable.&nbsp; At about midnight we arrive at</p>
<p><u>BASSEAU</u>.</p>
<p>which is very close to Arras, and we understand that the enemy armoured cars have broken through our lines here, and that further down the same front his cavalry have also succeeded in forcing a passage.</p>
<p>We only remain here till about dusk the following evening and then start to march further down, and continue marching right through the whole night with only a few minutes spell at times.&nbsp; On nearing the locality of Albert an advance guard is sent ahead to report, as it is about here that the enemy cavalry have we understand broken through.</p>
