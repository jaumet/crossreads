<p>Mar 19<br/>We reach Amara, a large town on the river. Said to be noted for its wonderful brass work.  We stay for three or four hours &amp; go ashore.  Latchford &amp; wander across to the officers club, then cross the stream in a native boat &amp; put in an hour at a picture show, filled with yabbering Arabs, the fat only  [indecipherable] to do ones sitting on the easy seats   <strike>that</strike>near us.  The pictures are antiquated but evidently enjoyed by the audience who became extremely excited at times.  We nearly miss our boat but fortunately bribe a tommy motor boat driver to chase our craft which we board while on the move.</p>
