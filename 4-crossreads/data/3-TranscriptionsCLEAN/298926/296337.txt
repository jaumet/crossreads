There is also another  Theatre & tea rooms where a first class programme is rendered by the Pier  Orchestra.  These are gratis to wounded soldiers.  Opposite the pier is a large  underground aquarium where the piscatorial displays are very interesting and  educational.  There is a concert in the hospital every other night
