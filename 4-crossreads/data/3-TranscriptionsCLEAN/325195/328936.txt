Smithers & I went to the beach for water & had a dip while we were there & the water was like ice; Stan was also in swimming on his way to Anzac to have his tooth filled; The sun came out very hot about dinner time & I put in an hour or so building a rain proof shelter & I now think we can afford to treat any rain we are likely to get with contempt: The Canteen rations were served out to-day but they did not amount to much, one tin of Cocoa-milk, a bottle of vinegar, one tin of sardines, 1 tin of Herrings & 3 tins of Ham & tongue was about the total we received. Stil heavy firing to the South.
