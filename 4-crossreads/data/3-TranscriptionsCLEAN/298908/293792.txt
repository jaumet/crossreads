  
 Have been feeling very restless & discontented all day long so this evening after tea I collared my stick & set out for a long walk.  It was a lovely evening & the air quite sharp & nippy.  Everything looked splendid all the foliage of the beech trees has taken on a lovely golden tint & some are quite yellow, soon they will all begin to fall & cover the ground with a golden mantle heralding the approach of winter.  The grass is quite green yet & so are the hedges.  There are some very pretty walks round here, the one I took tonight is one of my favourites I pass several old fashioned churches nestling among clumps of oaks beeches & pretty flowers, their old towers standing out plainly against the sky while behind them are the chalk hills covered with clumps of scrub & old fashioned thatched farmhouses are here & there with stray stock running round the stables & farmyards waiting for their tucker.
