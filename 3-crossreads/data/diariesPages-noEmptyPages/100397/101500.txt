Worgret Camp
Wareham Dorset 21st 1.
Dear Mother. I received a couple more letters from you one dated 23rd Oct So far I have not received any from John. so expect that there is one from him somewhere. your letter had one from Betty enclosed. The two Flannell flowers were in perfect order, but one of them broke as soon as I touched it. I am going to try and gum the other onto a card for Elsie. She is very interested in the Australian wildflowers that Betty has told her of and has some of them fastened onto stiff paper with gum. some Baronia, Wattle and a couple of others. I was going to send the other to Nurse Gee. I may still send it but it is broken so I am hoping that some more arrive I was telling Nurse one day about the different flowers. she wanted to know what Australian Wattle was like, and when I showed her a piece, she knew it, for it is grown in France and Italy, and is sent over here to sell, each year. I saw great Bunches up in London when I was up there this trip but it is not nearly so fine as our Australian Wattle.
The weather here is wretched it froze hard last night and has been busy Thawing all day, the Ground is nice and slushy in consequence, the Sky has been the same leaden
Im afraid that there is very little news in This when I start to pull this Army to pieces I feel I could keep going for any length of time
