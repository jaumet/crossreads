1/8/17 Campagne
with the flimsy wooden crosses. Put Rodda on as Adjutant upon hearing that Stewart had been under amputation of a toe from an accident in Paris. We began to think that he must have been bitten by a duck! Received word that there is barrel of beer for us at Bde HQ and today is Pay day too. Powys the Canteen Corporal has gone to St Omer buying goods and will open today. Many old heads Crowley, Nelms, Robbins, Grant etc turned up last night and have resumed duty with their companies again. At 3pm went out with Rodda to "C"Coy. Leaving H.Q. we went round trim lanes like Melbne. suburbs or like the one to BonAccord and came to a canal with a bridge over it. On this bridge is the usual guard of a French and an English soldier ? both of military age. The canal is fairly wide and straight and many barges were coming along drawn by horses on the towpath. Shells are brought from the Thames right across the Channel and up these canals.
