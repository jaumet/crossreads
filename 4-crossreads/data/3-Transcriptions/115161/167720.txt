<p>letter, I found it had been left in my other tunic, but as I had plenty of time, I did not worry much as I had decided to keep on asking the direction.&nbsp; I bought a ticket to Finsbury Park and got on the underground train, and changed at Charing Cross.&nbsp; So far all was well, I sat on in the carriage until it was almost empty and then asked the conductor when he thought we ought to arrive at Finsbury Park (it was now considerably after 4 o&#39;clock).&nbsp; He told me that the station I mentioned was not on that line, that I ought to have changed at Leicester Square, but if I got off at Highgate, I would be also be get to my destination by bus or tram from there.&nbsp; He said I would catch a tram just at the top of the steps.&nbsp; By this time of course I was bewildered but I endeavoured to appear calm.&nbsp; I went up the steps from Highgate Station and got on the first tram I saw but unfortunately neglected to enquire if it was travelling in my direction, and was not informed of my error until the conductor came for my fare, when he told me to go back to the station and catch a bus which would take me to the &quot;Nag&#39;s Head&quot; and from there I could get a tram to my destination.&nbsp; I eventually succeeded in getting the correct bus (after chasing two or three for about half a mile and then discovering that they were not the ones I wanted) and after paying my fare and asking the pretty conductress to drop me as near as possible to Finsbury Park, I sat down to try and collect my scattered brains.&nbsp; I arrived at the house of my friend at about a quarter past six.&nbsp; I had taken over two hours and a half to do a journey which should have taken a little over a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>At some of these underground stations is what they call an &quot;Escolator&quot; - which means a permanently moving stairway -,(whoever invented the thing or it&#39;s name is immaterial, I have my own opinion of him!!!).&nbsp; They say it relieves the pressure of the passenger traffic at these stations.&nbsp; The reverse was my painful experience.&nbsp; You just step on the thing and you are taken up or down without any effort on your part.&nbsp; That part of the business seems quite simple.&nbsp; You can walk down the &quot;escolator&quot; if you so desire, there</p>
