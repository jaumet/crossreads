to the Clearing Station in the morning & now here I am. It is a good job. I have sole command of a contingent of some 14 camels & their attendant native drivers. I is I think though, the beginning of the end. I am on the shelf, shop soiled. Well, I have seen Sari Bair, Romani, Katia, Bir el Abd, El Arish, Magdhaba, Rafa and they will do me for the rest of my life quite well.Vance must have changed him mind, it was quite a surprise for me to come here.
