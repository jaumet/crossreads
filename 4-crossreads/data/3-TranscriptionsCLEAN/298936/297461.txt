Monday 1
Busy day helping Bonner with an annex to the Hospital. Sawed wood in the morning until I thought that my arms would fall off.
Lately the artillery seem to have sprung to life again for a day never passes without a few shells from the "Olive Grove" - five & six at a time instead of singly as formerly. Turks have evidently established fresh batteries there.   The firing is not one sided [indecipherable].
