Pay Cards, one of which I hold. Then had real good dinner at War Chest of Soup, Roast Beef & Vegetables, & Jam Roll, for 1/- only. Then went to Cash dept of Pay Office to draw money, but nothing doing as they have received strict instructions not to pay on a pay card - therefore they have wired to Weymouth for my Pay Book & it will probably be here on Tuesday. Then went to Passport Office in Victoria St - got application form for passport, then had 6 passport photos taken for 7/6, having to call for them on Monday morning. Then saw Lieut Cocks, the O.C. Cash dept - he was very nice but could do nothing till pay book comes along. Then took bus to Strand & cabled home for money thus - "code Cable fifty C'Wealth Bank, London, Returning America" at defferred rate 1/6 word as chap reckoned it would go almost as quickly as 3/- rate. Then went down Strand to Aldwych YMCA & there met Bert Carroll who was in P B & Cos Haby dept. Had yarn for about 1/2 hour then I went to Aust. YMCA near Australia House & had tea. Then went along Strand; Trafalgar Sq, Leicester Sq & about the West End having look around & finished up at Baker St, where I took Tube for Victoria & then to War Chest Club to bed. During afternoon saw photo in Sydney mail of Buckler who was at Bourke.
