tres white.
I hope this year will close the war. Ive had 20 months service now this is my third campaign so Im a bit tired of war. Could do a trip home or to England easily my word.
Havent had any letters in a month on account of the move here, but expect some soon surely. 
I send my best love to you and all at home and friends and hope to see you before too long a time is past 
Address the same

Love again to all 
From Yours affectionately
