<p>My darling Eddy,</p>
<p>This is the only card I have but hope to get some good ones on my way home.<br/>This one 'Your King   &amp;  Country thank you" was given to me by one of my poor one legged boys. He was asking me if I had any little brothers or nephews. So I told him about you   &amp;  he wrote on it with great difficulty. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses<br/>Auntie Eadle.</p>
