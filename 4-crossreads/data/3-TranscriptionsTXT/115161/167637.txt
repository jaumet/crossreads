 ing post in front of our position.&nbsp; Needless to say I am one of the chosen ones.&nbsp; A guide conducts the three of us to the spot selected which is just a shell-hole, the floor is of course the usual mud. 
 We take our &quot;seats&quot; on a bit of wood and gradually begin to sink in the clay.&nbsp; Our eyes soon become accustomed to the darkness.&nbsp; Our bayonets appear to shine brighter than usual, so we rub some mud on them,so as to lessen the chance of detection.&nbsp; We can distinctly hear the voices of the officers giving orders, and the noise of the transports just above us.&nbsp; Gee, a wee bit nervy.&nbsp; We are unpleasantly close to &quot;them&quot;.
