  
 2.9.15 Thur. 2nd.  Orders came through last night for the Regt. to be ready to move off soon after dinner to-day & we were to go to No. 1 Outpost.  As we are on duty on the 'phone I went down & saw Major Granville & found we are to stop on duty on the 'phone here at Hintons Post till we are relieved by the 17th Btn. of Infantry, who are taking over this position from us.  We packed up our kits took them up to the 'phone & waited till 5 oclock before we were relieved, came over Walkers Ridge & arrived here where the 1st Regt. is camping just in time to cook & have tea before dark, as we were coming down from Walkers Ridge we had a spell looking at a 5 inch Howitzer gun firing Lyddite shells at the enemy.
