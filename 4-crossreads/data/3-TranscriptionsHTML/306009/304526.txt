<p>1915<br/>Dec.10 Fri.<br/>Rotten luck! A Corpl. who had come up from Gezira with patients previous day had orders from the Colonel to take me back with him first thing this morning, there being great activity at No. 2 G.H. Very nice to know that your services are valuable but extremely rotten when you are having a good time in Alex.<br/>Left Ras-el-Tin at 7.15 a.m. &amp; travelled out to Camp de Ceasar to say a hasty farewell to a couple of friends. Caught the 9  a.m. train for Cairo &amp; arrived at Gezira 3&frac12; hrs. later.<br/>Plenty of work in the afternoon. Old Man's papers have got all over the shop during my absence.</p>
