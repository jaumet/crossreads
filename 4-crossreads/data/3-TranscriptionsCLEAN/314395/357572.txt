  
 that, things like that published in the papers are the cause of a great deal of unpleasantness among the fellows over here.  That is why I spoke about that other affair and although as you said, under the circumstances, I hope you will never publish anything of mine again. 
 The weather, ever since I have been in England has been miserable and lately it has been particulary bleak, always frost & snow.  The suffering in France must be awful.  Address your letters to France as before, as I will soon be back.  There is no news of interest so will cease rambling. 
 Best wishes Your affect. son, George
