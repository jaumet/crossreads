  
 Friday 20 July 1917 
 Heavy Fog & both Turks& our own Battery kept up a Bombardment. We were out on a driva all night & got some Bedouin spys & Patrols, and 13 Turk prisoners. Killed a few. Night & day have been turned into one lately, it is hard to keep count. We were only in Camp long enough to fill our NOSE BAGS & get some Tucker & off again - "Taubes" killed a few New Zealanders with bombs. I opened fire but the Target is so small, a square yard only vulnerable & that travelling at the rate of 60 or so miles an hour, takes hitting.
