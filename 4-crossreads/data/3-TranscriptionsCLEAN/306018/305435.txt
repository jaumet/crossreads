  
 May 1917 Wednesday 30th to June 5th We have been having a fairly good time.  A certain percentage, 2% of the men were granted leave for 6 days to Cairo Alexandria or where they wanted to go.  We drew lots, but I didn't get a place.  Swimming has been indulged in daily.  We make a parade of it for everyone at 10 am.  We exchanged our old rifles & have got the latest pattern with high velocity barrels.  The ammunition has been changed also.  The weather has kept cool.  We got paid on the 1st. 
 An Australian mail arrived on the 4th I got 4 letters.  Have written 7 or 8 & my correspondence is about cleared up.  We were issued with shorts & puttees  & they are very cool.  Artillery has been fairly active of late.  We havn't seen many aeroplanes but bombs were dropped near the railway line.  An enemy aeroplane was forced to land by a few of ours & the pilot taken prisoner.  Have been acting Squadron Quarter Master as Cheater has been taking McGrath's place whilst he is on leave.
