<p>Thursday Oct 10<br/>Today we moved into village of Amman taking over a small stone building as a Hospital.<br/>At the back of us is the remains of a huge Amphitheatre of roman days. It is worth seeing. Tiers upon tiers of large stones formed in a circle &amp; used as seats to look over the arena. We are exceptionally busy here. The boys are brought here from the various units camped some two miles out. We keep them here for the night &amp; if they are fit to travel they leave by Motor Lorry at 4 AM in the morning for the next station at Esault. From Esault to Jericho, Jericho to Jerusalem</p>
