<p>France<br/>19.6.18<br/>[indecipherable]<br/>Dear Father<br/>Received word a few days ago from the Bank saying there was money waiting in there. Thanks very much for sending it across. I asked for it so I should have a stand bye I dont think I shall do another long spell in France without getting a blighty.Well I had a bit of hard luck the last time in the line lost my pay book all my photoes &amp;amp: what money I had some one went through my tunic. Had my pay book &amp;amp: photes in a pocket wallet together.So have sent across to the bank for [indecipherable] to keep the pot boiling while I am waiting for the new book is coming usually takes two or three months to get another. shall have to wait &amp;amp: get other  photoes to replace the ones I have lost. I have bein away at a Gas school for a few days it was only a short coarse.  Near Boulogne.The section officer said it would be a few days spell as I was sent from the line to go down. It dident prove much of a spell as we had  six hours a day parade. Most of the time was taken up with lectures &amp;amp: Demonstrations.Then after parade we had to write up our lectures from notes taken.  Hadent time to go away anywhere. I made friends with a French family used to go there to have tea then had a table to do my writing on so scored the Australians are in the boom here now as this Division stopped</p>
