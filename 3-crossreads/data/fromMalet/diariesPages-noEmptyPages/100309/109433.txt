11/7/17 Beaulencourt
Morning was devoted to attending a lecture on Venereal Disease by Major Conrick Archdeacon Ward. It was very good and informative but will not I think deter the conduct of many. A very pleasant day ? long grass, sun, and a balmy breeze. In the afternoon the whole paraded from 2-5 on drill of various kinds (including saluting) and did good work. After parade went down to BdeH.Q. and saw the B.M. We are going up to Renescure. The King comes to Albert tomorrow. This about the chief news. Had a yarn with Colonel Watson about things in general and then a motor came and they all went down to Division. Early mess tonight on account of D Co concert which proved to be a great unqualified success. One chap was an actor with Bland Holt and gave some good sketches with others. An audience round the open platform was of several hundred men. Afterwards with Davis rode over the scene of work tomorrow.
