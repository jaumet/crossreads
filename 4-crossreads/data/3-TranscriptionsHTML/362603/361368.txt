You are very fortunate to have the Park Girls quite handy.  Tell them that we have so little to write about other than what we tell You, that it would be useless to write a letter to them.  They can read all our letters   &amp;   we think of them even though we may omit their names sometimes.  I think that I told You I was on Night Duty from 6 pm to 6 a.m.  I generally sneak some sleep between 2 am   &amp;   6 a.m.   &amp;   then sleep from 6 a.m. to Noon in my own Bed.  I get up then   &amp;   on the last two days I have taken a walk with one of my Night orderlies to two different villages.  Yesterday I went to a place called Millstone   &amp;   saw the little old church   &amp;   an old mill.  In the Vicar's Front Garden is the remains of a Cottage in which Addison the Poet was born.  There is only a piece of old Brickwork about 2'6" in high, 3' wide   &amp;   2' long, probably the Chimney base.  The Church has Choir   &amp;   altar   &amp;   12 seats, 6 on either side of the aisle.  All these old Churches shew that they were at one time R.C. by the spaces in the wall for the Holy Water   &amp;   by other R.C. Characteristics  It is enough to shew the age because C. of E. did not properly start till Wm Prince of Orange's time.  The Monastery adjoining is well over 300 years old   &amp;   the old oak Doors on the Church   &amp;   oak</p>
