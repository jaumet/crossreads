 Turksare mounted on miserable Arab Stallions, but they carry an immense load & are loaded to the teeth carting around LANCE & Sword, Shoes, NAILS, Picketing Peg, NOSE BAG, BLANKET, MESS TIN, Ammunition, TUCKER, etc.:- Mostly LOUSY, but fat & young lucky chaps. We drop propaganda literature in the Huts & Outposts for their Patrols to pick up. Some of the saddlery was made in VICTORIA!!!, the bulk of equipment in Berlin.  Neither you nor DAY ever mention domestic troubles. I suppose old Daisy is doing the work as of old & not grousing - as I am inclined to but I'm getting Homesick.
