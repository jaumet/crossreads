<p>Wednesday 1 December, 1915</p>
<p>Our lads again assulted by the Malitia, they were pelted with shrapnel from a bridge that runs across the road, one man had to go to hospital.</p>
<p>They are afraid our lads will run amock so they are sending all the fit men away in the morning.</p>
<p>I went into Valletta to see if [indecipherable] was still at Cattinca hospital&amp; found that he was so I spent the evening at Pieta &amp; slept at the Hotel De France &quot;on tick&quot;.</p>
