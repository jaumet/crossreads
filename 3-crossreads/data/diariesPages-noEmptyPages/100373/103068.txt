bow, the shape of the barge accompanies by the tall fin shaped sails were very interesting.

We were treated to ices, cakes, and also tea as we sailed up the river. After about two hours sail we anchored near the river bank and were allowed off for an hour or so. In order to get on to the main road which ran parrallel with the canal, this is a regular thing in Egypt, we had to cross through fields of splendid grain. In the cool of the evening once could hardly imagine themselves in Egypt. It was more like being in Scotland on a beautiful summers evening when the corn etc is just beginning to ripen.

Having enjoyed our short time ashore viewing the natives at their work in the fields, driving home their pecular and I may say ugly looking cattle goats etc we returned to the steamer.

We had a splendid supper on board and it was enjoyed by everyone.

Prizes were presented to the winners of the sports which were held on deck on our way up. Some of them which were presented to the men were of a humorous kind and were the cause of a great deal of laughter.

Mrs McK and M.D. who had entered for the ladies three-legged race were very much surprised and needless to say delighted when they learned that they had won the race.

The remainder of the evening was spent in a free and easy concert in which some very good singing was given. We arrived back at 10 pm.
