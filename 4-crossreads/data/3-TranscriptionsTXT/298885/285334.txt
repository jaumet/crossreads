get through in time.
June 7th - 19Just as the clock timed 6.30 this morning we entered between the breakwaters into the Port of Colombo.
This port is not very large but is laid out in a manner to enable a great quantity of shipping to berth as such was the case on our arrival
It is for mostly for coaling purposes that ships call here and the little harbour presents quite a busy spectacle with its numerous tugs and barges of coal.
