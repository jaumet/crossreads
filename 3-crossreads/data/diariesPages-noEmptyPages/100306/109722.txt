Firing Line Le Sars M16b67-M16a08 
24/2/17 for issue of bombs rations extra SAA c were issued. Much excitement. Soon news arrived that Mavramont and Serres had been evacuated. Orders now for certain posts to move forward and take up positions in enemy Gallwitz Tr. Issued with C.O. the necessary operation order. Information now from Brigade Major that a prisoner left behind with trench feet that the Germans have left the trench for two days. Hamilton on his return reports trench very heavily manned and wired and flares going up in many places. At midnight definite orders arrived for an attack to be delivered by 1 a.m. by the men on the posts against the hostile lines. A manifest impossibility. I moved up to the left company headquarters and found scenes of great mix-up there. Cull having been reported as going over with only 6 men. No reports at all coming back. Things very quiet in front with few flares. Forbes was in a state of intense excitement and came up. Got C.O. to shift his headquarters up here and Groves arriving I set off in advance for the enemy line. The time was about 5.30 pm night pitch black.
