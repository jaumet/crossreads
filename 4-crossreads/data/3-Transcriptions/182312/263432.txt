<p>men getting out to meet an attack and also as a means of escape should</p>
<p>the main entrance be blocked by having the trench blown in on to it.</p>
<p>Electric light was fitted throughout also rough bunks one on top of</p>
<p>the other round the sides of the walls.&nbsp; Various stories reached us</p>
<p>of sumptuous dugouts being found xxxx fitted with brass beds, roll top</p>
<p>desks, billiard tables etc., but of this I have no first hand knowledge</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With such trenches as these it would be quite easy for the</p>
<p>enemy to remain in comfort below whilst a bombardment preceding an</p>
<p>attack was on, relying on a couple of lookouts to give the word when</p>
<p>the infantry attack commenced so that they might come up and meet it</p>
<p>with their machine guns, a weapon which the Germans use to great</p>
<p>effect.&nbsp; That the enemy were driven out of these strongholds reflects</p>
<p>great credit on the British troops who formed the attacking party on</p>
<p>1st. July when the particular area of which I have been speaking was</p>

<p>lies about Ovillers - La Boisselle and beyond to Pozieres and there</p>
<p>are no adjectives in which to adequately describe its hideousness.</p>
<p>La Boisselle on the right of the Albert-Bapaume road is not more than</p>
<p>a flat layer of pounded stones and mortar on the bare face of the</p>
<p>earth.&nbsp; Of anything like a village or individual building there is</p>
<p>no semblance.&nbsp; Standing on the edge of the road in the glaring</p>
<p>sunshine (it was very hot and dry when I was there, no rain having</p>
<p>falled for nearly three weeks) with the roar of our own guns behind</p>
<p>one and the bursting of the enemy&#39;s shells ahead, one feels oneself</p>
<p>the only landmark in a waste.&nbsp; The whole earth&#39;s surface is torn</p>
<p>with shell holes and seamed with lines of trenches, all white because</p>
