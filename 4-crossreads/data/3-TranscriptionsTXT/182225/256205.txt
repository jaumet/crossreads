 1916 &nbsp; SATURDAY 19 &nbsp; FEB. 
 Very windy &amp; dusty. On the guns again in morning. I spent most of the morning taking a breech block to pieces and putting it together again. There are 23&nbsp;pieces in it and not one screw, every piece fits perfectly. Came into Lisheen in afternoon. Eileen went to the Kings after tea. M rs &nbsp;Lloyd&#39;s eyes were very bad, as she &nbsp;had had them treated in the morning. Linda &amp; Self yarning over the front gate. 
 Jo went out to M rs &nbsp;Macdonald&#39;s in afternoon for tea
