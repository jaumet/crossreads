<p>Monday 2 April</p>
<p>Out of bed at 10.30 a.m.  Bitterly cold wind blowing all morning which later on turned into a snowstorm.<br/>Walked into Bapaume for canteen goods without success.  This afternoon two of us went up to Beaulencourt for the rations.  Today there is a vast improvement in rations.  Not only has Capt. Marshall given Connell &amp; I a tin of Glaxo &amp; Arrowroot on account of yesterdays exertion but Col. Shepherd, O.C. of our ambulance has sent his bearers extra bread, butter etc. (a motor amb. full).  The attack came off this morning resulting in a success.  We have taken all the villages we were asked to.  Wounded are now pouring into Bapaume.</p>
