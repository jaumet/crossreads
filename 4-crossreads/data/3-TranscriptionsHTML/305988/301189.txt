<p>Dear Clarrie</p>
<p>Received your very welcome letter yesterday dated July 28th. I am taking a risk with this, I am going to give it to a chap to post for me when he gets over there. Well I will give you a bit of "dinkum" news. We went up to Bullecourt on the night of May 2nd, breasted the tape, which had been put down by the Engineers, 400 yards in advance of our front line, which by the way happened to be a very shallow sunken road. Well we lined up on the tape at 3 a.m, and had to wait there till zero time which was 3-45 a.m. At 3-30, a quarter of an hour before the hop-off, Fritz put a searchlight on us, saw us and over came the shells thick and heavy, but as luck would have it, he put them a bit to far, so they didn't trouble us at all, except to put the wind ---- a bit. Well at 3-45 there was a rumble behind us &amp; then our barrage</p>
