 Tuesday 25 April 1916 A beautifully fine day. The usual training for all Aust. troops was cancelled to enable all to take part in an "Anzac Anniversary". The whole division marched up to a spot near Etaples: a gently sloping old cultivn. field ending in an abrupt embankment with pine trees growing on it on one side, the isolation ward being on the other, the field stretching back to the sky-line 300 yds. away. On the embankment a gay colouring contrasted with the dark green of the pines, red capes &amp; grey dresses of the Austn. nurses, grey of the English some of whom had the neat white head-dress &amp; VAD's the red cross on the apron, brown of the Americans, the Canadian light blue dresses &amp; navy capes with scarlet lining, making with the light blue uniforms &amp; red ties of the convalescents &amp; the kharkis of English officers a most gay picture. The other 3 sides of the square made up of troops. Fine memorial service by Senior Chaplain, address by Commandant, &amp; the March Past. After lunch attending to company matters. Had a bathe in the little stream: it was fine. Mail in but none for me.
