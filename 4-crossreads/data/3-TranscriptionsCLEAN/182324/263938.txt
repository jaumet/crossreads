Dear Mr Leplastrier
Thank you very much for the copy of the "Yandoo" which you left at the office for me. I am very pleased with it & shall put it with my other treasures of the war.
I quite remember your son now that I have again seen the Photo, but it was a little difficult to bring him to memory for the moment.
I was at the Port Street Congregational Church on Sunday Night (Armistice Day) & heard the Rev. Ruth give an address on "Lest we forget" It was splendid & it must have given heart & courage to many of the congregation who were still mourning the loved one taken & it was splendid when he said "Yes 58000 gave their lives for us! but they still live, they are here now, gazing at us with their bright shining eyes." I could not help thinking what a beautiful thought. We could not see them but they were there
