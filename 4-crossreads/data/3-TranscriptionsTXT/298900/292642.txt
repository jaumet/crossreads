eliminate waste.   The great spirit of the people was touched on, they being satisfied to put up with shortages so long as we, the Army, had plenty & the general feeling amongst the troops that we could spare a little for the civilian population.   Altogether an afternoon well spent.   Coming back called at the 15th Field to get some [indecipherable] of the place re taking over & then back to camp.
Thursday 28th Feb    Received orders at the last minute that I had to go on ahead & take over at the 15th Field.   Packed up quickly & arranged with my offsider to fix things up at the M.D.S. & then went in the car to Dranoutre at 11 oclock.   Had a look round & lunch with the 15th Sgts & then fixed up all the duties in order to take over the Hospital & got the men to have a look at their job ready for the morning.   Also took over the dispensary.   At night went into the Y.M.C.A. & listened to a lecture on Seamen of Drakes time by a Mr Fitzgerald, very good & stimulating.   He also gave several humourous recitations.
