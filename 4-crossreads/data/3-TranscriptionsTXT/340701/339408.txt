was digging a communication trench & had just dug a decent hole under very heavy shell fire a shrap. then came very close and to Dixon's disgust an Officer who happened to come along just then beat him for the hole & left him trying to crowd himself into his tin hat
Monday 7-8-16Shelled all night & shelled all the way out this morning.  Shelled every night lately.  The Brute just sent 3 J. [Jack] Johnsons into our camp missed the Boy by about 7 Feet and for about the 10th time I was within 30 yds of a H.E. Shell when it exploded.  Fritz is sniping Sausage valley with a big gun and has already put one Battery out of action beside blowing up horses men dugouts etc.  This morning I heard that J. Woods is near Albert with the 84th Battery F.A.
Wednesday 9-8-16We shifted camp yesterday on account of the shelling I believe.  We are now in a worse but safer possy.  I believe they got that big gun that sniped the Battery.  The other companies are now having their spell but we are hanging on still
