Saturday 3rd Oct.
I had fully made up my mind to grumble about the tucker today. Since we left the Berrima we have been living fairly well but one gets tired of the best. Today we got fish ? tons of the best by way of change beside this our new cook ? Steer ? after expending much ingenuity pinching spuds onions much money buying what he could not pinch, made us some fine stews. The last dish he served up to us was the cause of a very gruesome struggle between him J.B. the cook's mate, the latter faring rather badly. Two of "E" Company were courtmartialled for breaking into German's house. They were sentenced to 21 days solitary confinement, 21 days in chains in a public place.
No more fighting has as yet taken place.
