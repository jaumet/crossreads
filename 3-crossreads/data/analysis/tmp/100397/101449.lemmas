 Mont Video Camp . Weymouth . 6.9.16 My Dear Mother I have been out on furlough for a fortnight , and return on the 4th to this camp . it is a bleak and dreari sort of place and just at present it is not at it best , light scud of wind driven rain , and the wind blow half a gale near all the time There is plenti of mud about you can just imagin what it is like . I believ we move next week to Salisburi , then I suppos it will be Franc later on . whether we go there in the winter or not I cant say but I would not be surpris . I am just about sick and tire , " not of the war " but of the men at the head of affair , and a lot of the cold foot swine that are over here in fat job and who will take their share of prais for what has been done when they get back . some of them have been here over 12 month and there is noth wrong with them , and never was much at ani time except that their feet were cold , Well if they get the prais when they get home , they are gain the contempt
