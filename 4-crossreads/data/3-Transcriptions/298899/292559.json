<p>they tried to treat me in that fashion. The old lady was a heavy smoker &amp; rolled cigarettes for me as well as for herself. Wine they do not drink to any extent, tea being their drink as it is ours but the men in Russia always drink it out of a glass, the women only, using cups. A taxi (to save time) took me to the Boulant Restaurant in the Boulevard Capuchines where I met my pal &amp; his aunt &amp; we had dinner together. We then adjourned to the Nicka Bocka bar for light refreshment, took leave of my pals aunt, then taxied to the Folies Bergere a music Hall of doubtful reputation, a visit to which is necessary before one knows Paris. The show itself was poor but the Parienne life there pictured was at least interesting. Prior to this we had decided not to return by the night train so wended our way to the Hotel &amp; turned in after a yarn &amp; smoke with two Australian officers during which we exchanged our respective experiences &amp; adventures in Paris. Believe me they were some yarns.</p>
