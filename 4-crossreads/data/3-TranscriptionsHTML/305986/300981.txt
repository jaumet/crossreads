<p>get on it too crowded. Went up last night same thing happened, got severely knocked back going up again <u>tonight</u> might get away this time  Jove the little crowds of Australians here are a disreputable crowd mud all over torn Pants, tin lids and colored mufflers, while the Tommies are mostly spick and span, but we'll all be alright when we hit London and get a new rig out.</p>
