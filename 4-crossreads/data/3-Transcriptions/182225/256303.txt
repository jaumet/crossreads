<p>JULY&nbsp;&nbsp; MONDAY 3&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>A cold wind blowing all day &amp; a shower or two of rain at night. They had a couple of practise shots with the 4.7 in the [sheen/stern?]. We had some Semaphore signalling in morning &amp; none of us got on too well. Had some buzzer work in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Look up and not down,</p>
<p>Look forward &amp; not back,</p>
<p>Look out &amp; not in &mdash; and</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lend a hand.</p>
