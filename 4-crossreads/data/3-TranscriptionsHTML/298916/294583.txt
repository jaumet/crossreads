<p>His redeeming feature was his even temper which I never saw him lose. To make a long story short he was a man.</p>
<p>Next morning I reported myself to Captain Jackson at the Company's office. He was a very surly looking man at first but after a while when I heard of his hard life, it could be seen that he carried the marks of his hardships. He was an ideal commander &amp; everyone on board, excepting the chief officer who had known him for years, was terrified in a way, when he began to "get busy".<br/>Do your best my boy was all he said to me, &amp; you will find me very fair.<br/>I asked him whether I would require a uniform and as the other Companies were supplying them, whether he was prepared to follow them.<br/>Wear your pyjamas if you like he said but you had better get one. (at my own cost).</p>
<p>It turned out later that an operator or person officiating in any respect, not wearing a uniform may be shot without trial, if captured by the enemy. If in a uniform it can only result in being taken prisoner. As Captain Jackson put it: If you get nabbed, jump into your bunk &amp; kid sleep.</p>
