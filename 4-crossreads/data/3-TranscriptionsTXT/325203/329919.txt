 AD SUMMUM. 
 The orbit ends &hellip;. A perfect sphere, to loving earth divinely giv'n 
 Until its miracle was wrought, one raindrop more returns to heav'n, 
 It seeks its immemorial source beyond the bourne of mortal years, 
 Untinged of blood, nor dim with dust, nor salt with tears. 
 The spot it blessed, the watered seed, the living branch, their witness bear; 
 The blossom by the orchard-side, the ripened fruit, give promise fair; 
 And we who breathe that fragrance dear recall our Edens of the prime 
 Ere yet we saw the teardrops on the cheeks of Time. 
 The raindrop in the wave was merged &ndash; a wave majestic, tempest-hurled, 
 High-towering o'er a sea that swept in surge on surge to cleanse  the world &hellip; 
 A wave of waves was all but spent &ndash; through bloody surf it heaved the rest &hellip; A drop was lost; a bubble broke &ndash; but -  on the crest !
