<p>Monday 4 June 1917.</p>
<p>Land sighted at 8 a.m. and then again at 10 a.m. Still in charge of guard on isolation. Fastened to buoys inside breakwater at Colombo at 12 noon. Coolies started to coal our transport at 2 pm. Some came alongside in small &quot;bum&quot; boats and dived for money. Some of the boys changed money with the &quot;niggers&quot; while the &quot;Harbour Police&quot; were not watching</p>
<p>On our right is the main fortress of Colombo. Trading boats coming into the breakwater harbour all day. Port Sydney anchored close by. Some of the boys off our boat swam over &amp; on return were &quot;clinked&quot;. Shoals of porpoises seen. 2 extra other cruisers escorted us the last 50 miles to Colombo &amp; all 3 are now in harbor.</p>
