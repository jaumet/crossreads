<p>6.15 a.m.  I walked up to the Railway, Lime St., &amp; caught the 5.30 p.m.  It was very cold in the train but I had good company &amp; the distance was not wearisome at all.  A Civi, a Tommy &amp; a Dundee W.A.A.C. &amp; myself.  The 4 letters mean Women's Army Auxiliary Corp.  There is also a Women's.</p>
<p>Arrived in London I tried to get a room in the Strand where I usually stay but failed.  So I went up to H.Q. where I have a Pal &amp; as He was on Night Duty, I had supper with Him &amp; then slept in His bed.  I caught the 8.50 train next morning &amp; arrived in Camp at 12.30 p.m.  I had a lovely time while away.  I had a letter from Marie yesterday &amp; she told me of a lovely long letter she had from you.  I think I must have made too much of a fuss in writing about Jennie &amp; not enough about Marie.  They are as different as chalk &amp; cheese.  Marie did not say anything.  She is much too grand to take notice of such</p>
