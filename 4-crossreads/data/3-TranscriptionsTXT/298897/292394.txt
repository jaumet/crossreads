August 1916Once in the days of long ago,Days - of my whole life the best -When the time for sleep had come,And the house was hushed to rest,It was such a happy thought,Used to make my heart so light,We were all beneath one roofWhen I barred the door at night.
Let the wind moan as it would,Let the rain-drops patter fast,They were near me, nestled warmFrom the midnight, & the blast;Not one lingering out of reach,Not one banished far aloof -It's a woman's heaven to haveAll she loves beneath one roof.
Now, when bedtime comes at lengthTo me, sitting here alone;And the ticking of the clockTells how still the house has grown,Oh, how heavy is the heartThat was once so light of yore;Now - I seem to bar them outWhen at night I bar the door.
