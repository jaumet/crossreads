The walls of the native quarter are corroded to a depth of inches with the urine of generations. 
Trades are all carried on in little box like shops open to the street and the smell of fried foods and garlic permeates all. Oh Hell what would I give to be home in the clean air of Sydney or Melb away from these savages and their filth. 
The fine houses are dreams of Arabic architecture and the flat buildings very fine too. 
But the Pests if you stop in the street dozens surround you trying to clean your boots, sell you fags, cards or any damn thing. One is always snapping out Emshi! (go away) Yallah! (get out) pushing them off only to meet more, hideous beggars, wretched women blind with skinny babies, stretching out for the eternal backsheesh.
My French improves, I can carry on quite decently now, and it's a great help here. The native music is most fascinating, wierd, wailing, desert stuff ? very musical ? to the accompanyment of the drums.
