<p>trying to make my clothes &amp; boots do until we go to England or France but am afraid I shall have to renew some here. I'm having a Day-Off-Duty-, so taking a good rest. Washed my hair, stocking, singlets and now writing a long letter to you. Shall be helping this afternoon arranging for to-night's <u>Party</u>. Cakes etc ordered from Cairo &ndash; Hope they come! Had a very sad time yesterday. An Officer took suddenly bad &amp; died. He was a C. of E., so had Communion &amp; wanted another sister &amp; myself to have it with him. We have some awfully trying times occasionally. The poor fellow died about 20 mins afterwards but he was quite conscious through the service &amp; answered the responses. if the war does nothing else it makes most soldiers &amp; nurses realize that there is a <u>Supreme Being</u>. Well, my dear folk, you will wonder what's happened to  <u>Edith</u> writing like this &ndash; Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all. From your loving sister, Edith.</p>
