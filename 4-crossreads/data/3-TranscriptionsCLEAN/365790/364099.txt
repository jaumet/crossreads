German infantry & consequently were drawn into the fighting.  The Huns, however, surrendered without much effort but in Bellicourt itself stiff opposition was encountered.  Thanks to the Battalion Lewis Gunners who outfought the German machine guns this village was successfully mopped up, 6 officers & 201 other ranks being brought in as prisoners.  As the infantry had moved up & taken charge the battalion withdrew.  The casualties for that day being one officer (Lt Hassall) & 5 men killed while 2 officers & 56 men were wounded.  Further work on the roads was carried out beyond Belllicourt on Oct 1st & one platoon exploited the St Quentin tunnel.  On Oct 4th the battalion moved back to Roisel which subsequently proved, as many felt, to be its last day in actual warfare.  After a few days first at Roisel & subsequently at Peronne the whole division was withdrawn to an area near Abbeville for a thorough rest.  Here training was carried out & a large amount of time devoted to athletics &sport amusements.  Orders were received to be ready to move on Nov 10th to further take part on the fighting - this move was postponed to Nov 12 but the armistice being signed on Nov 11th this was again postponed indefinitely. The battalions war career was now over; a move by very tedious stages was made at the end of Nov to Hautrepe & a fortnight later to Beaurieux.  At the first named place demobilization began & from then onwards the battalion dwindled; the last 130 of the unit embarking for England on May 15th [1919][Transcriber's note: See also 'The Story of the 5th Pioneer Battalion, AIF' by F.
