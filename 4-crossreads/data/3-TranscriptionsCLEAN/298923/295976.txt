25 December 1918 WednesdayXMAS DAYAll hands merry many drunks- 1/2 lbs of PLUM PUDDING, 6 eggs, vegetables & a parcel from the Comforts fund- football & [indecipherable] different officers the recreation-!!!  Nearly all the old fighting men have gone & a new lot are here who know not us-   Rumours we may leave here soon for nearer the Canal but who knows.Started an Officers Mess all together many months since we ate together now.I thought of you all today & only hope we may be together ere long-  Just got a Post Card from Joe written in Vancouver I hope he got home safely-
