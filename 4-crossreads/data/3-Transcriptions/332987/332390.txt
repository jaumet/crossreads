Our 15 pdr. went into action last night, gone forward, an anti-tank gun.  Enemy aeroplanes over again last night.  A few bombs were dropped as we say on the outer circle, a fair way from our lines.</p>
<p>20-5-1918<br/>Battery Sgt. Major Crittenden to go to St. Johns Wood (O.T.C.)  tomorrow.  Sgt. Torpey acting B.S.M.  Weather still good.  A few shells flying about.  Enemy planes fairly quiet.  The French made a slight advance on our left, captured 200 prisoners.</p>
