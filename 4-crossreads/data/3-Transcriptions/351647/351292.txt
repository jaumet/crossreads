<p>get decent smoking tobacco.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for the snaps, the sweet peas <strike>were</strike> are really marvellous &amp; the garden generally looks beautiful.  And how Graham is growing, it brings it home to me that I've been away for nearly 18 months.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear you were home &amp; loving it, the season must be weird.  Your letters do hearten me up &amp; I giggle no end.</p>
<p>I really don't know how to thank you because it is so decent of you especially when you have 24 to write to.</p>
<p>Only please don't get too pippy with me when I don't write every week.  I can't always you know.</p>
<p>And really there's very little to write about.  I must clear now.  Its no use talking about the war, the next two months will see lots of changes.</p>
<p>Give my love to Mac &amp; Graham &amp; the Boss &amp; very much to yourself.</p>
<p>Yours as ever,<br/>Jim</p>
