<p>The nearest station to catch the train from where we were billetted was Poperinghe. I had a lift most of the way in an army waggon. It was quite a long journey in the train from Poperinghe to Boulogne. We started at 11/10 landing at Boulogne at 7/20. No lights were allowed on the journey for fear of the aeroplanes</p>
<p>The Rest Camp where we were billetted was about 2 miles from the Station and it was most uphill march &ndash;</p>
