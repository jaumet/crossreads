wife is a nice woman who speaks without stilted affectation. In fact they might be Australians so free are they from accent. Tonight I go to dinner there with General and Mrs Robertson. Returned to camp at 11 and went to the Orderly Room for a while. Saw Jack after mess. General Robertson called in a car. I introduced Crawford Vaughan late Premier S.A to the party and the car then left. We were received by footmen who took our wraps then announced us. The Duke and Duchess introduced us to their niece Mrs Loder and we had a very merry little dinner party and there was no restraint at all. Left at about 10.30 and the run home was a little cold but dustless ? these roads are so good. About midnight an attempt was made to burgle my cubicle but an alert batman frustrated it.
