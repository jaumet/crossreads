<p>Monday 15 July 1917 [1918]<br/>My last day of GT x &amp; x &amp; 60 odd pts.  9.30 a.m. sent for &amp; told night duty tomorrow.  4.30 p.m. told night duty tonight, good management?  No sleep &amp; very little rest as had to pack etc.  Attacked by Miss G. &amp; to leaving V.A.D. Dalzeel on 5-8 duty though Miss Cheetham gives permission, hopeless muddle with 2 women ruling &amp; Miss G. speaks to me as though I were something in utter disgrace.  After all the different women I've been in hosp. with to meet one like this is to say the least trying &amp; she has no sense of humor, so we shall never understand one another.  On duty officer's ward 8 p.m., 26 pts. all nice &amp; none ill beyond malaria, dysentery, fractures, etc.  6 am. brings 2 "flying men", one dead on adm. the other fractured arm &amp; cut face, one Cowen dead, 22 yrs. other, Lt. Taylor, 23.  Very tired &amp; depressed &amp; sleep the sleep of the very weary.</p>
