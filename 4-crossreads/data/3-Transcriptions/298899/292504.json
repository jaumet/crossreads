<p>off to the Gas Hospital. We only had 11 cases through during the day. In wounded we had a good few both from the line &amp; wounded nearby also several of our own bearers with two deaths amongst them. Only one shell actually threatened the A.D.S. dropping just across the road &amp; throw earth all over the ruins &amp; road. The A.D.S. itself is under the ruins of the building, in the cellar part which is reinforced with concrete, the men sleeping in various dugouts around. Aerial activity is very great several battles taking place in the air without result so far as I could see. The Hun appears to come over very freely &amp; in the dusk the machine gun bullets being luminous can be seen quite plainly. one taube was brought down by Ani-Air-Craft guns last night.</p>
