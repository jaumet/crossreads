Someth went amiss up about the middl of the train , and when we arriv at Andover some of the men had to get out , then we were shunt into a loop out of the way and a man arriv with some tool , to fix the train up . Some of the comment were humour but I cannot repeat them here . one man ask if a piec of string would be of ani use to tie it up . there was someth wrong with a coupl I fanci and there were mani other thing said about the train , that did not amus the Rli offici who heard them . They took the damag carriag off and then away we went en Rout onc more for Wool . at last we arriv got off the train , hungri and tire , it was 3 P.M. and we had not had ani dinner , that did not matter as we were onli convalesc , not fight soldier . we form up and set out for camp . arriv there and after some time some light refresh was serv out veri light ani way a loaf of bread between 4 men and a tin of Salmon between 6 . that nice old Salmon that is as dri as Sawdust . I wouldnt like to move camp too often here . The Depart save too much on the meal that we dont get . Come down from Tidworth I saw some fine old Pheasant in the field along the line , it must be fine sport Shoot them , they seem allmost as quiet as ordinari Poultri . They were feed amongst the stubbl , and in some of the Plough field , I also saw a few Partridg feed in the stubbl field besid the line .
