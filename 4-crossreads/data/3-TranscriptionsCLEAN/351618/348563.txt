 War is going to make old men of a lot of our lads. 
 Our infantry has done a lot of sapping tunneling underground from one trench and coming out on another ridge where further trenches are cut when out of view of the enemy. It is hard and tedious work as all the earth out of the tunnel has to be carried out and to the back of the firing line in small bags. In this way we are often all able to sap up to the enemys trenches and blow them up - often men and all - just as they would do to us. 
 Tuesday 6th July To-day I was warned that I would be temporarily transferred to another gun in our Battery now in command of Lieut Hodgens.
