  
 Troops still continue to pour in from the Colonies & one cannot make the slightest guess as to the number of men now in Egypt. The Detention Barracks over here in Cairo & Abbassia are now becoming cram jammed with Venereal Diseased men, I cant for the life of me understand what they are going to do with them in the end. 
 16.3.16 Thursday Had a hard days work.  Went out riding during the cool of the evening with S Haynes.  Old Jack turned up to-day as he had leave from Tel-el-Kebir.  They get one day every month to come up to Cairo & purchase different articles. My poor old Batman "Woorack" was put in the Hospital to-day & consequently I have to do everything myself.  I hope he soon comes out as I miss his well meant advice. Jack showed me a letter he received from Nina & he was as pleased as punch.  The 1st Australian Division are now on the water for France so I suppose you will all soon hear of it.
