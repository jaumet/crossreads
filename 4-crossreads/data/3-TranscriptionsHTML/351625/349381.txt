<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>I think it is time I dropped you another letter but as there is very little to tell in this quiet place you wont mind it being short.  I have been expecting to leave hear for the last fortnight but havent gone yet although I dont think I will last another week out.  Our docter has been so busy with influenza patients round here that he hasent had time to come here &amp; see us &amp; mark us out.  I dont much mind how long they keep me but wont be sorry to leave as this is such a quite little town &amp; we always have to be in at 5 p.m. sharp &amp; on no account can we get a pass after that time which is pretty rotten as</p>
