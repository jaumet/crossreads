20 Things got very lively on our right early this morning, expecting an attack from Turks. 3 Battn in rediness to reinforce men in fireing line if needed, Went for a dip this afternoon. Had a good feed on our return consisting of Biscuits, singed bacon and Bully Beef warmed up to , to say nothing of half a tin of Deakins Apricot jam, the stuff that does more damage than half the shells fired on Peninsula. However what dont fatten will fill.
13th Inlying picquet to day. 3 of our Warships hard at it down at Cape Hellas this morning Turks reply to their fire and some of their shells go pretty close. Our Howitzer's hurl a few shells at Turk trenches this evening just to let em know we have a few rounds left I suppose. Turk Artillery also waste lots of ammunition fireing at one of our aeroplanes this evening. One of our lads killed by falling empty shell case.
22 Stand to arms at 3 oclock this morning untill 5.30. After a feed a party of us went down for a dip out near no 2 outpost, after about a dozen of us were splashing about like a lot of youngsters, the Turk snipers opened fire on us and then there was some joy getting to the shore, it seemed such a long way off, but they only hit one man in the arm after all sniping, needless to say we did not venture in again that day. Expecting an attack to night, stood to arms at 11P.M and dispersed at midnight nothing doing.
