is passing between gas port muzzle some of gases go through gas first, through nipple of gas chamber into gas regulator where any hard fouling is left, the clear gases then pass through hole in gas regulator, through hole in face of gas chamber into gas cylinder where it strikes cup head of piston driving it to rear.
Action of piston rod ? As p.r. travels to rear teeth of rack being engaged in teeth of pinion rotate pinions thus wind up return spring ready for next fwd. movement.
Striker post ? As p.r. moves to rear it carries with it the striker post which works in cam slat of bolt. For 1st 1 ins. nothing happens then right side of striker post bearing on right side of cam slot curve rotates bolt 1/8 turn to left thus freeing bolt from body locking recess allowing it to be carried to rear.
Bolt Ejector - As bolt moves to rear extractors having gripped base of bullet draw it from chamber. Then the left lug on feed arm actuating stud strikes tail of ejector forcing it into housing ? the ejector moving on a pivot, the head is thus forced out into bolt way where it passes through slot on left of face of bolt strikes base of bullet throwing it through
