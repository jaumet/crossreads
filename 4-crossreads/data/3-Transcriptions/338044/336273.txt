<p>18th September:- Monday<br/>A dirty day &amp; raining all day (a truly unpleasant sort of rain). Hundreds of wounded coming down the line &amp; all the hospitals are being cleared out to receive them. The numbers of wounded coming down &amp; the subsequent reports of the newspaper, carry out the rumour we had last week of the contemplated new offensive at Flers  Ginchy, Thiepval &amp; our success is now well known, having taken the 3rd German line of trenches. Our fellows come down here still wet after yesterday's rain &amp; bringing trophies of German Helmets etc. About 1000 of the 4000 German prisoners taken were marched in here to-day. Big</p>
