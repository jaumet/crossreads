 Revielle at 6. Had a rotten night for without bed ropes the piquet is kept busy. Wrigley horse was down & had to call up the boss who fixed him up alright. First Parade motors overhauled & tried mine OK only oiling a little unsatisfactory. Toby & I went for a run around the Nile the road follows round the river & is exceptionally good at here the river is about 400 yds wide & rich growth is on the other side. I also visited a native mud village which is too dirty to describe for the nigs only exist & as for washing themselves its unknown the motor [indecipherable] the niggers nothing also the donks cant make it out. After dinner all the horses fetlocks were bathed & ointment given to those that needed it for the sand plays havoc on the hoofs. During the night 200 LH came in & tomorrow we expect more. Letters arrive but none for me. Have been ordered to Cairo in the morning with the boss am looking forward to same. 
 10 December 1914 Thursday 
 Revielle at 6. Stables as usual horses [indecipherable] very sore & Toby has been splicing rope all day for [indecipherable] at 18.30 I set out for Cairo with the boss up on the bike the roads were great until we came to the native quarters & there is was shocking the mud & water goes right into the huts. When we arrived in Cairo we went to the Continental Hotel & from there to the Anglo Egyptian Bank for our money. Met a corp motor cyclist of the Res, have arranged to have a run on Sunday of all motor cycs. Started out at 12 pm for camp & had great difficulty of finding the street as they run any way. The road was all along the Nile which is a fine river after our Yarra & the natives draw their water from it by a series of water wheels in the afternoon the men were paid & I was on leave for the night. I set out with Sgt Metcher for Cairo had a fair time but am already sick of the place for nothing exists but filth & uncleanliness on every hand Arrived back at Camp at 11 oclock & bed later.
