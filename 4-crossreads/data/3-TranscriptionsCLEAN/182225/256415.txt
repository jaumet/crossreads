 OCTOBER   MONDAY 23   1916 
 Fine & fairly warm. I was Brigade headquarters orderly all day & heard that all drivers ect had boys up to clean harness ect so I did not show up till 10 pm at night & missed it all. Everybody getting things ready for the inspection by General Brunker tomorrow. Campbell got thrown from his horse & had to go into Fargo hospital.
