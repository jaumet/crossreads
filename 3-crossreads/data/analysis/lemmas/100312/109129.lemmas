 31/10/17 Rome it afternoon pleasur and shop crowd and from here walk home to the Regina Hotel . After dinner went down past the Quirin to Pension Boo and toward the Apollo varieti hall but did not go into either of them in spite of their vaunt charm . Walk up and down the street watch the peopl ? in the cafe . Theatr and show do not commenc here until 9 or 9.30 and finish after midnight . The gendarm seem to be alway in coupl and look as if they have step out of a romanc of a hundr year ago , wear their long black cape and their 3 corner hat . The fountain of Rome seem to be numer and good and are alway play both by day and by night . Sweet peel of bell ring out from old church at everi hour and the quarter . Until late at night the cri of vendor come from the street but none can compar with the man with the paper whose ?Italia ! Italia " is loudest .
