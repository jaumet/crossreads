 26/12/16 Zenith , Spectrum , Gusti Trench A veri busi night almost as mani telephon as an Exchang . Our right parti for strong post got lost and we had no tide of them at all until about to 1 when they report all correct . Awful mud and condit . One poor devil lost his boot and was wander about in bare feet . Gusti be too crowd we shift a few back to Millar Son . After get in , the ration men had to go back and cart their food up and order also arriv for a patrol to go out . Arrang all this by telephon and heav a great sigh of relief when at last the welcom messag arriv " Relief complete" . Sit in this deep dugout with 35 feet of earth on top and a staff of runner and signal I control all this area . The R.S.M. leav in the morn with VD contract from a mademoisell in Flessell . The Doctor is bad with bronchiti and say he think he is get T.B. This absolut the worst Xmas in my life so far and we shall be up here again on New Year Day .
