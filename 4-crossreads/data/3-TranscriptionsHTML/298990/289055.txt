<p>Buire (Picardy) 28/10/16 After a hasty breakfast hurried off to the Bde. and spent the whole morning with the other C.O's and General Gellibrand discussing many topics.  The whole place very mucky and full of creamy mud.  The streets of the little village are thronged with troops, an old poor church with an old tower is in the centre and possesses a clock that is going.  Had all O.C.s up to a conference during the afternoon.  Jack came in for tea and stayed for the evening.  The doctor was talking to the old people and getting details of the 1870 war etc.</p>
<p>29/10/16 Colonel Smith returned early and I handed over things to him.  At 11 am we had a church parade in a large barn. A wet cold day and quite cheerless.  Stayed in and read all the afternoon until called out to settle a claim brought forward by a man who said some of our soldiers had stolen a large door belonging to him and having taken it away had used it for firewood.  The people we have been among lately are all quite remarkable well disposed and friendly towards us.  It has been our custom quite to look at the inhabitants as suspicious but there is nowadays no reason for this.  The lads got their pay tonight and naturally rushed the old dame's coffee and cake supplies.  Their French is very funny par example:- "Ung coffee":  "Doo cake" etc.  When the troops are here and have the money these people do very well but then soldiers are not always here.  Sent a cheque to [Lake?] tonight.  A fine clear night with star spangled sky.  The leaves are falling fast on the wings of Autumn winds and the foliage of the trees takes on a yellow tinge.  Rumoured that a Gallipoli ribbon is to be issued in a few days -  the Egyptian colours being used.  Hope this is true.</p>
