1/9/18 Mt St Quentin ? Peronne
shrapnel Our men could be seen thro the glasses entering the village and working up through the ruins. After they disappeared from sight other came up in support. Shortly afterwards we saw them debouch out into the open and assault a Hun trench on the ridge. As they approached several of our men were bowled over. Presently they entered the trench and about 30 Huns emerged with hands elevated kamerading. They were collected despatched to the rear. Returned to see Duggan and then moved the Bn. up in daylight to Gottlieb Oder Trs. and Hgram Alley. Some dead lying round in huddled heaps. Wounded still continue to arrive and we have used the Huns time and time again as carriers for the stretchers. The 5th Division are now through Peronne and consolidating on the other side of it. A sunny day.
