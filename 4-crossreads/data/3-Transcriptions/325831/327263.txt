<p>His Honor Mr Justice Ferguson<br/>Sydney</p>
<p>Dear Mt Justice Ferguson</p>
<p>You said one evening when I had the pleasure of meeting you at the Hospital at which our mutual friend Blunden was lying up that you would like to see any letters that came to me from Brigadier-General, now Major-General Holmes &amp; as I have received a letter from him within the last few days I am sending you a copy of it. I think that the letter is of a rather personal &amp; private character to myself, but some parts of it might feel interest in reading.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>H.S. Williams</p>
