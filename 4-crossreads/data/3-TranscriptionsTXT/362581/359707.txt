My darling little Eddy. XOXOXOXO
I was so delighted to get your lovely letter   &  kisses yesterday also your photo. I'm very proud of my little soldier Nephew. All the photos are splendid,   &  Grandma looks very happy with her little pet. the family group is great   &  I think Alice Peel is very clever. XXXX
I do hope you   &  Auntie Ethel are quite well once more   &  that you will all be able to go away   &  have a good holiday.  Love   &  kisses From Auntie Eadle XXXXXXXXXXX
