 My dear Father 
 I have three or four of your letters to answer, so here goes. Another mail came in yesterday, but it must have been an unexpected one in Australia because I only got one from Mother written in Miss Con's tea room. However I had a letter from Kookendoon and heard all about yours and Fred's trip out there. I hope to get a letter from Fred next mail, with his account of it, then I'll be able to compare the two. I dont expect I'll know home when I get back with all the new improvements. The little paddock and the top of the back paddock being cleared must open things up a lot. I have just been showing those last samples of wool you sent me to a chap
