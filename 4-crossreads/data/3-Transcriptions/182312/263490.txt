<p>received such treatment as was dealt out to it on this occasion.</p>
<p>One is constantly reminded of the last Franco / German war for</p>
<p>each village found about has a memorial somewhere within its</p>
<p>boundaries erected to the memory of its contribution of soldiers</p>
<p>who fell about Bapaume mostly during the first week of January 1871</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is rather an important town, as roads and railways</p>
<p>radiate out in several directions forming a new connecting link</p>
<p>with out forces in the North and South.&nbsp; The scene on the Main</p>
<p>Albert - Bapaume road immediately after the occupation of the last</p>
<p>named town was a remarkable one.&nbsp; The traffic was immense.&nbsp; Guns,</p>
<p>ammunition, transport of all descriptions, cavalry, foot troops,</p>
<p>Red Cross, vehicles, etc. flocked along in streams all day and</p>
<p>night.&nbsp; Piccadilly never saw such traffic.&nbsp; About every couple</p>
<p>of miles the Boche had blown a huge crater in the road measuring</p>
<p>about 50 feet in diameter and abour 30 / 40 feet deep.&nbsp; To look</p>
<p>at one of these holes at first one would think that about 50 men</p>
<p>could fill it up in a day, but after a day&#39;s hard work the hole</p>
<p>appears as big as ever.&nbsp; It was found to be much quicker to build</p>
<p>a road round each side of these craters (cutting down the banks</p>
<p>where necessary) than to block traffic whilst they were being</p>
<p>filled xxx in.&nbsp; In one place a huge caterpillar dragging a</p>
<p>howitzer blocked the traffic badly by falling into a trap left by</p>
<p>Fritz.&nbsp; Whilst the frost was on he had driven a tunnel under the</p>
<p>road about four feet below the surface knowing that when the thaw</p>
<p>set in, the first heavy vehicle passing over would dislodge the</p>
<p>earth and fall in.&nbsp; The caterpillar fell in all right and in</p>
<p>doing so swung half way across the road.&nbsp; The next heavy vehicle,</p>
<p>coming in the opposite direction in order to avoid the cater-</p>
<p>pillar edged well over to the side of the road and there fell</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
