<p>My Dear Ones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Two mails it is since I wrote you at any length; today, I&#39;ll try to atone for such neglect with a longer letter telling of some interesting things I&#39;ve been doing of late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturday week Novr 4<sup><u>th</u></sup> we chose to visit Amesbury Abbey for the grounds are most beautiful, they have a few good portraits by Lawrence &amp; Reynolds &amp; on the bank of the Avon there is an old stone room, built into the bank, &#39;tis called &quot;The Diamond&quot; &amp; here Gay wrote the words of the &quot;Beggar&#39;s Opera.&quot;&nbsp; O<sub>n</sub> the previous Friday night I had been the officer of the piquet in Amesbury &amp; making my H.Q. at the Abbey Hotel had sought by enquiries permission to visit the grounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This permission was obtained &amp; Sir Cosmo Antrobus in addition expressed a wish to meet us &amp; his willingness to show us the house as well.</p>
