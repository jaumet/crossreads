NOV.   SATURDAY 4   1916
Fine & the sun shining all day but it came on to rain & blow like hell at night. Doing a dozen little jobs round the stables in morning & getting ashes in the afternoon and then on horse picket again at night & worked till midnight on my harness. The Colonel inspected all round in the morning & dont think he was satisfied with everything, by the way the officers have been rousing since.
