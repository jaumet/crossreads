 Monday, 1st Jan. 1917 Dull, cloudy, intermittent trench mortar activity on our right front all day. 
 Tuesday, 2 Weather dull but fine.  Went round to Billets in the afternoon.  McCook came in. 
 Wednesday, 3 I visited the Billets this morning &amp; the Hospital this afternoon. Tonight we held our Bible Class.  The numbers continue to increase, tonight we had 19.  It was difficult to find seating for them all, some sat on the floor.  We took parables of Hidden treasure and pearl of great price.  There was quite a long discussion on the subject. After the meeting I drew up a will form for a young fellow. 
 Thursday, 4th Raining today.
