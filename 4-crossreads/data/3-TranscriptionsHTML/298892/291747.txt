<p>France,<br/>4th. August 1917.</p>
<p>My dear Parents/.<br/>Your letter of the 11th. June reached me a few days ago.<br/>Poor old Doug. has been exceedingly unfortunate lately. One would think, comparing his list of casualties with mine, that he was at the front and I was at home. Although his work is far harder than mine and requires twice the brain power. It is so long since I have had any mental exercise that I often wonder how I will tackle hard work again.<br/>After a few days rain and wind the weather has again picked up and is now ideal, and the whole countryside is a picture. The french people are still toiling from morning till night to get their harvest in before more rain comes along.<br/>The Sergt. went on leave last Sunday and I was transferred to the main dispensary in his stead. I was very sorry to have to leave my comfortable quarters but there was no alternative. We managed to secure a bed last night so that  I am almost as well housed as before I moved.<br/>All the roads here are lined with Hazel bushes and I am looking forward to a good feed as soon as the nuts are ripe, which will be about October.<br/>In these quiet country places there is very little worth writing about and I have exhausted my slender stock of news already.<br/>Trusting that all at home and next door are well<br/>I remain, Your loving son<br/>Eugene.</p>
