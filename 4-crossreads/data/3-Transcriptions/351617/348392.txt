<p>we were to get ready and march to the Ground on the following morning. Everybody was busy all that day, and next morning we marched 6 kilos and formed up all round a ring that had been made for the occasion.

<p>The Artillery galloped out with 4 guns there not being more than a foot between the wheels of the guns and keeping in a line abreast all the way, took up a position and fired a salute, as one shot. It was beautiful to watch.</p>
<p>The 3 brigades and Div Sigs held a competition of sending a message over the lamps, then over the flags, thence per phone, thence per Sounder, and then ending at the winning post per Motor Cycle Dispatch Rider. The div Sigs won by a very short space, all the bikes being on the run home at the finish.</p>
