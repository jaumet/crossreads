<p>Monday 4 January 1915</p>
<p>A very monotonous, uneventful day &ndash; very hot and very ennervating.  We are just beginning to realise how dull the life on a troopship really is.  Each day, when you wake, you see the same ship, in precisely the same position and at exactly the same distance from "A38".  The "Ceramic" (A40) is on our left, and the "Themistocles" (A32) is on our right.  These two, together with our own ship, are the leaders of their respective columns, three in all.</p>
<p>Then there is the same wonderfully calm, deep-blue sea, that, when you go on deck in the morning, you wonder if you have really moved during the night.</p>
<p>There are wild rumours going round the ship to-night that we will go in close to Cocos Island and that we may see the "Emden".  The scenes of enthusiasm, if it comes off, (I do not think for one moment that it will) may well be imagined.  But I have learnt never to heed the rumours you hear on board ship.</p>
