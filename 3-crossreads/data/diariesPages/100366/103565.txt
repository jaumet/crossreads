 
gradually slopes downwards to the Battle Line & ends in a maze of marshes & dykes which dot the whole country hereabouts. A battery of heavy guns is consistently firing away on our right & so far the Germans have not answered for fear of disclosing their position.

I will try & give a description of the new British Engine which at the present time is the talk of the world.

Imagine a machine almost as large as a railway engine, on one gigantic caterpillar wheel on either side, heavily armoured & with small & big guns inside to say nothing of numbers of machine guns.

They can cross a 12ft trench easily & demolish an ordinary house by running against it or smash trees down. They can do a frightful lot of damage & generally work in liason with the infantry. They go ahead & destroy the German machine gun emplacements & so enable our troops to advance without serious loss. In my opinion they have destroyed hundreds of German machine guns since they have been used. The Germans are terrified of them & well they might be, as nothing but a direct hit of a high explosive shell can hurt them. They are like a big tortoise, they way they crawl in & out of the various places. Altogether I fancy they are a great asset to the Army & save a great lot of life.
