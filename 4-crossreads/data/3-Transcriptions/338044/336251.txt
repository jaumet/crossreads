<p>23rd August:- Wednesday<br/>A beautiful day &amp; rather warm. Plenty of work. Going hard all day. Dinner as usal at "Stewarts", but going with two of the boys, Robertson &amp; his friend to their hotel, am surprised at the fine meal supplied after work &amp; decide to have my <strike>indecipherable</strike> evening meal here. The lady in charge is very nice, rather well off, the girls speak good English. Overlooking Station Yards &amp; opposite the gate. Most peculiar situation here; a French &amp; an English sentry are on guard &amp; eye each other all day   Take a walk of inspection round many old houses of 14th Century until 10 pm</p>
