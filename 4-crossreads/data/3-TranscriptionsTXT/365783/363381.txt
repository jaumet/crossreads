but made a hit & guessed  2.10.   when you open the parcel I guess you will be surprised at how expensive things are here.   The value should have been declared at about 5/-.I am sending with this a few photos taken during the trip on the Kyarra.  I hope to send you some good ones of Cairo & our camp later on.  I hope to be able to go out to Uncle Joe's camp to-morrow evening;  I had a letter from him to day asking me out to dinner.   Hoping you have had a nice pleasant trip & that you are all happy & wellWith best love,From your loving old manWill.
