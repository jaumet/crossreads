<p>morning we set to work to make a proper dug-out. At night we got orders that we had to return to Mudros. Our dug-out was too small for four of us and we spent a very uncomfortable night there. There was continuous rifle firing, the whole night long. The familiar Egyptian that we had seen so much of in Egypt was to be seen here also, doing labouring work.</p>
<p>Oct 5th Tues.<br/>Packed up and went aboard the SS El Kahira. Three of our boys refused to return with us. Arrived at Mudros in the afternoon. Had to walk three miles to the A.D. Camp.</p>
<p>Oct 6th Wed.<br/>Had to sleep out in the open. Food is very, very scarce here. We were all put on fatigue duty carrying stones. The ground here is very stony. The hills are of a volcanic nature. Had a walk through one of the Greek villages about here. The houses are very irregularly built. Not much formation about them. <br/>Women are to be seen spinning wool by hand. Quite a contrast to this, at one house sitting outside an old lady was sitting spinning by hand while inside the doorway a young girl was stitching some garment with an up-to-date "Singer" sewing machine. Inside most of the house they looked very clean and tidy.</p>
<p>Oct 7th Thursday.<br/>Unloading stores in the forenoon. Went into another camp away in another part of the island. Met Rentoul</p>
