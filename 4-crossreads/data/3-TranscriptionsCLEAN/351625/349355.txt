Batt. Willie comes away to, its just what Bill would do enlist when once Bob got safe back, he has been wanting to come all along but stayed for his Mother's sake.  I am glad recruiting is doing so well but hope they wont be needed to do much fighting, I am jolly glad you are not allowing Bruce to enlist before he is 19.  That reminds me it is his birthday in a couple of days, wish him many Happy returns of the day for me.
I suppose Ingledene is looking up again now with Spring coming on.
