 28 June, Saturday 
 W. Awful gale raging. I get up &amp; do an hour's work. Lie down behind screen on seat all day. Dinner &amp; tea but I refuse pork. I read about mysteries of Marseilles. Go to bed after an hour's work at Tea time. 
 29 June, Sunday. 
 F. Lovely day. Cool. Gale ceased but huge swell. Breakages galore. I feel more safe &amp; work all the time. I write &amp; read Milton. Go to bed at 9 pm.
