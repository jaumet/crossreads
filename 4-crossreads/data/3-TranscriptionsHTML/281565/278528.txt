<p>side.  Saturday 26th March, we sighted land, which was the cause of much conjecture aboard.  The general opinion was that it was the southern coast of Sicily, &amp; as we passed through the Straits of Bonifacio the following morning it is probable that this is correct.</p>
<p>Our Strait of B. was also a matter of a good deal of conjecture, as during the afternoon we passed north along the coast of an island, which was said to be Sardinia.  Ships were plentiful hereabouts &amp; as we passed close in shore we had a good view of the fields, green with early spring &amp; the white cottages of farmers nestling on the sides of hills.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of Monday 27th land became dimly visible ahead &amp; by dinner time we were well in shore, heading in to the port &ndash; not of Marseilles as we had expected</p>
