<p>Tuesday 7 May 1917 [1918]<br/>One of life's most awful days thus far.  After a night of pain, washed by V.A.D., had rigor, T. 102, P. 108, severe pain in abd. worst ever, seen by M.O.  As all spots are painful he re-bandages, eyes me through to the backbone, asks what I usually take for headache, "nothing" &amp; I murmer the truth "too much noise", no answer but offers Phen. &amp; Caff. cit. 2 tabs taken B.T. allowed.  Peaceful afternoon, sisters go out, piano ceases.  C/Sister gives dose Sod. sulph. 6 p.m. so no escape but it is not the awful mag. sulph. of 6 a.m.  M.O. 7.40 p.m. asks a question or two &amp; departs quietly.<br/>An Aust. sister visits me very kindly &amp; one is in the ward.<br/>S. Cambridge writes Matron as to my whereabouts so the 27th knows of this new plight.</p>
