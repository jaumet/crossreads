Everyone is kissing in the streets & no one seems ashamed of it, procession after procession goes by singing & beflagged roaring its way towards the Square & the "Hoe".  A piper comes past followed by dancing crowds of young chaps with their girls, & Boy Scouts are out in their glory the restaurants are packed to the ceiling & hungry crowds wait outside.  Aussies climb all over the horses & wave their flags like fury shouting & yelling the while.  At last I reach the Hoe & this beautiful & historic place is crammed with people all laughing & shouting.  I pass by old Drake looking stolidly out to sea & wondering if his spirit which is in the people of Devon will ever be called upon to rise & inspire old England.  There was a great crowd round the old hero's statue, Drake is just idolized in Devonshire he was born here & just close by our Camp is the Church where he used to worship & was married.
