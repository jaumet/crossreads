 25th cont. The Chalk Pitwe found occupied by C Coy. Of the 21st Battalion. The O.C. of the Company pointed out all the German trenches to us, and particularly Point 54, and advised us to concentrate upon it. I observed a German poke his head up at strong point 54 and regretted not having a rifle. There were two Stokes Guns in the position and a large quantity of ammunition stacked in an unsafe position, the cap end of the cartridge facing the enemy. We returned and visited the heavy gun pit. They have made the KAY DUMP within a few yards of the pit, connecting it by a tram line. We obtained our bicycles from the engineers dump at FRITZ'S WELL and returned.  I had a clean up and then went to see the C.R.A. with regard to the possibility of placing the gun in the Quarry. I came back and gave instructions to Y4A Battery to get one gun and 15 rounds into the Quarry. X4A Battery had instructions to fire one gun from their position, but when they got up there they found that everything had been buried. The bombs were scattered all around the top of the shell craters. They returned without any casualties. One mans received a slight wound with a piece of H.E. 
 26th. An attack was made at 4.55a.m. by the 6th Aust. Inf. Bgde. They took almost all their objectives with the exception of point 54. They were also, driven out to point 31. The O.C. Y 4 A Battery 2/LT. Hirst proceeded to Quarry in the afternoon with instructions to have the gun in position by 9 a.m. on the 27TH. Difficulty was found in cRossing the ridge leading to the Quarry owing to heavy barrage which FRITZ was putting over. At length the gun was placed in position. The 4th. Aus. Inf. Bgde. expressed great satisfaction at the mortar being there. This was noted as a rather unusual circumstance, as the infantry are not usually pleased to find medium trench mortar placed near them. Lt. Hirst reported to the C.O. of the Battalion on whose sector he was operating and was asked by him to co-operate in an Artillery stunt which was about to take place on Point 54. Six rounds were fired by the medium mortar and were observed to be very effective, three of them landing among enemy working party. 
 27th. Nothing 28th 2/LT.ANDERSON and party of four men went to repair trench mortar position at R33 b o 4. Beds are dug out and bombs collected. The usual shelling was in progress. The beds were put in position so as to fire on Mouquet Farm and point 04
