<p>19/5/18  Montigny</p>
<p>Soon after 1 am I was outside waiting for our guns to brisken up for the attack.   It was a fine warm night with a faint moon and the deep boom and flash of an occasional heavy gun was all that broke the peacefulness of the scene.   From the saturated earth rose a hundred warm and pleasant odours.   At 2 am a heavy rumble commenced soon intensifying into a loud and continuous roar and flash all along the front.   Under that barrage my boys were jumping off to the assault south of Ville sur Ancre and it was the first attack in the history of the Regiment in which I had been back.   I went back to bed but my thoughts were with the gallant chaps I knew were dying or being hit up forward.   At 4.25 a mounted orderly arrived from King who I had sent to stand by a telephone at Advanced DHQ in Franvillers .   It said that some prisoners were coming through and all appeared to be going well.   An hour after came another message saying that we had captured 100 prisoners 10 machine guns and 2 minnenwerfers up to date. Gorman &amp; Braithwaite then came in from a visit to the Heilly Dressing Station where they had seen some of our wounded.   Major Dooley, Wall, Fulton, Green, Greene, Southwell and Hunter are all wounded.</p>
