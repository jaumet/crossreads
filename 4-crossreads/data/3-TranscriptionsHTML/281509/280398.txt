<p>1916 June 24<br/>Saturday</p>
<p>Dispensary in morning.<br/>Tony out in charge of hospital tent. Heartburnings  of Box &amp; Payne: two other aspirants. Victory for Liverpool. Busy all afternoon fixing up hospital. 5 patients admitted. <br/>This "soldiering game" is a queer thing. Everyone for himself. "Bunky pulls the strings, &amp; the puppets dance".</p>
