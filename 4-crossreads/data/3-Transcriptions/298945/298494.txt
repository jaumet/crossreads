<p>cheerful greetings of these grateful country folk.</p>
<p>On arrival at Longpr&eacute; we unloaded our baggage in to an Ambulance car, which Birnie had brought for the purpose. &amp; got a ride to L'Etoile a couple of kilos or so away.</p>
<p>I am finishing this account off on Friday night, after a long gossip with Monsieur &amp; Mdme over the good war news, &amp; a shave &amp; clean up. We are to commence classes on Monday, &amp; this afternoon I made a notice &amp; prepared a timetable. An order has come out that no men shall sleep in any but authorised billets, but I shall hang on as far as possible &amp; chance orderly room &amp; such terrors.</p>
