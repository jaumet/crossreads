On the left is Bouzaincourt where we spent a very pleasant month once.  It is wretched to think of all these places being in Hun hands.  Spent a very busy afternoon in arranging details of our relief tomorrow night.  Col. Dawson of the 25th Battn. came and we pored over maps together.  This large sidestep is a complicated business.
