  
 24  [Apr] Fine weather prevails so far & making a splendid headway. N.B. Re the Malwa it is a frequent occurance of cargo boats colliding in convoys with bad results in troop transports it would be awful. 
 26 Naval Commodore on Kaisar I Hind continually at signals from daylight to dark. 10 pm Malwa altered her course the wrong way per zig zag & narrow escape of ramming the Indarra (the 2nd time this ship has made a mistake & near collision). 
 27 Similar occurance at 6 am & 11 am this day. Malwa within 400 yards abreast altered his course 20 to port instead of starboard. To avoid collision Indarra turned sharp around Malwa. Censured by Commodore by signals. Noon All transport 8 miles off Alexandria formed in single line 400 yards apart destroyers ahead side & astern. Hydroplane 50 miles out to meet us. 15 miles out trawlers monotors as extra escort whilst in single file steaming through swept channel. 2 pm Dropped [anchor] in harbor 4.30 pm Moored to transport wharf. The convoy brought from Marsailles 600 officers, 3000 Jewish troops, 4000 Indians from the West battlefield & 60 sisters & nurses for Mesepotamia & Palastine.
