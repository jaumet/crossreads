 The Palace, Heliopolis Aug. 3rd 1915. 
 My dear Jane., Received your welcome letter of 24.6.15 last night also Alice's of 21.6.15. it was such a lovely surprise when I returned to my room to go to bed to find a whole crowd of letters awaiting me. Well, I was so busy reading them, that I did not notice the time, until the night Sister came &amp; ordered me to put out my light 11.30p.m. Anyhow I awakened early this morning &amp; read them all over again. I received Annie's 3rd but it is the first one that has reached me. Tell her I shall write to her I shall write to her soon but hope she will write often. I just love to hear from my old friends. It is still very hot &amp; the place we are working at is much warmer than the palace but we have plenty to do &amp; the patients are awfully good &amp; cheerful. We are all very happy down there, hope to all live in a house near the hospital &amp; also Mess (feed) there. It is very tiring going
