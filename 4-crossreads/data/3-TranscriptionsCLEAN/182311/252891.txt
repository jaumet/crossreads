 Janie Nash, he is hoping for leave shortly & will he says visit Plymouth, where I'm sure will have the very best of times.  I always do. 
    The Bn is still in the _________ (underground) but my cold was bothering the  major  Major, who is at present acting C.O. & as I was losing my voice he sent me down to the horse lines until I go off to the Tommies, three days holiday he told me, no orders & no responsibilities. 
    Major Hurry is one of the most considerate men alive, he is very hardworking & brave too  t he delights to share the boy's perils & the boys realize this & call him "The Old  Prince ". 
    Well I can think of nothing else of general interest for a semi-public letter s . 
    Best Love, Harold.
