<p>War Diary<br/>1915  12th Oct.<br/>Reverse and enfilade and the beach is more or less safe and immune &ndash; Forwarded recommendations for specially good work, Capt T. Kidd 10th L.H. and Tr. Rickards, [Richards] also Sergt. Linacre and Corpl. Friday [Fryday] and Sergt. Wilson 9th L.H.<br/>8th L.H. very weak and remains in Reserve, supplying fatigues sapping and other parties and general picket --  The conditions of Bde. is as regards health very low &ndash; no rest &ndash; no relief &ndash; squadron cooking, compulsory boiling of water, extreme vigilance in hygiene and sanitation all are insisted on, and careful inspections made daily:  But constitutions however strong have become impaired with 22 weeks trench work, excessive labour in never ceasing digging, etc.  Diarrhoea and dysentry and enteric are daily depleting ranks.</p>
<p>The worst cases are taken to the 3 L.H. Field Ambulance for a few days, but the proportion of suitable food cannot be procured and there is absolutely no covering of any kind yet available.  This would appear incredible after five months  occupation, proximity of Egypt, and the fleet of empty ships available, but so it is, notwithstanding repeated representations, and this aspect seriously affecting our prospects must form the subject of after investigation.<br/>This appears to be due [space] of co-ordination between Army and Naval Authorities, and want of business practicability on our Staff.  It is curious that a saw or a hammer, wire, timber, a few nails, a forge, material for making kitchens, or cooking food are unprocurable &ndash; and the men are knocking out for the want of common essentials.  &ndash; one gets tired of repeated requests for these things &ndash; none available &ndash; no idea when, etc. etc. &ndash;</p>
<p>13th Oct.<br/>Our No. 7 M.G. knocked to smithereens and two men</p>
