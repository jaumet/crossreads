<p>Apr 27th&nbsp; We were medically examined and issued with fighting materials. The next fortnight we had to go through another course of training, at what was called the Bull Ring. It was very heavy training in the loose sand , a three mile pack march to &amp; from it,&nbsp; but at times it was an interesting illastrations of liquid&nbsp; fire &amp; gases model trenches etc and they were men from the front that were instructing.</p>
<p>May 13th We had an early rise, and moved off about seven thirty for the train to Albert, The scenery was very pretty all the way up.The banks&nbsp; of the canals looked very well &amp; we were all pleased to get away from the base. but I must add we were then inexperienced. When the train pulled in at&nbsp; we got our first idea of what war meant . the building ruined with shell fire , we were put in a camp at Becourt just out of Albert to wait till we were wanted in the line,&nbsp; just below the camp could be seen the the charred cross where the germans crucified a scottish officer. We could hear the guns and see the flashes of a night. we waited there till the 21st, so we did a little training to keep us fit, but spent quite&nbsp; a lot of time looking round the old trenches, craters &amp; graves which were very numerous not far from a large crater&nbsp; there was a division of Tommies buried and quite a lot of Australians about the same of the battle fields around those parts.</p>
