 [ The follow paragraph cross through . ] But for their petti mean and disdain snobbish they are to blame , these are person trait of charact all their own , which their posit give them the opportun of exercis , and for these they are dislik and held in contempt . On the 4th our limber was recov from the bottom of the Jordan . It took a whole day 's work for about a dozen men to get out , but out it came , with all the load intact . I do n't suppos there are mani limber and limber load that in the British Armi that have had that experi . I have recov all my own thing , and after dri most of them prove littl the wors for their two day immers . The photo , with one or two except were alright . One or two had the subject written in indel ink across the back of them , and this was transfer to other photo but that was all . There is a rumour afloat that we are to move in a few day , but noth definit . 11th April Today , I fanci I have a much clever idea of the reason of the retir of our troop across the Jordan . A veri strong posit has been built on the Eastern side of the river , with Barb wire entangl and system of trench ; heavili machine-gun . As was expect , Johnni , becom confid , has made an attack . He launch it about dawn this morn . It was the signal for a tornado of shell fire from sever batteri on this side of the river . Sinc dawn the dead missiv have been shriek overhead , on posit long sinc mark out . Jacko 's loss have , I believ been tremend . Big gun and littl gun have been rake his line with dead effect almost without cessat . Wound men come in state that Turkish dead are lie in heap . Now an artilleri barrag is burst behind his attack forc , and he can not go back , and the machin gun are rake him from the front . While too much relianc cannot be place on report come in from singl individu , as their view and grip of the situat is necessarili limit , there can be no doubt his casualti have been tremend . His attack forc is somewher in the region of 3000 and if ani of them see Turkey again they will be fortun . It was a clever arrang trap and Johnni has fallen to the bait .
