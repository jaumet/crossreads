<p>[Previous pages blank]<br />[Page 4]<br />Easter Sunday 31 March 1918<br />I am starting this as the train was moving along. We have just (10 to 7 p.m.) steamed out from Codford bound for the front. In the carriage are Ferns, Merrett, Bennett-Caten, Aubrey &amp; myself, the 5 sergeants who sailed from Sydney on 31 October last with the 10th of the 56th Bn, so we have kept together [since?]. We are to go to the 13th Bn. Aubrey won the billiard tournament at the sergeants&#39; mess at the camp before leaving. It started raining before we got to Westbury. Passed the huge white horse on the hill near Westbury, cut out of the chalk hill. We switched to another line at Kensington, London, &amp; rattled past houses about 10pm. &amp; window blinds were pulled aside, women waved to the soldiers, off to the front to try &amp; stay the Hun&#39;s advance. Had a bit of a sleep in the train, we got out at Dover Harbour station at 20 to 2. <u>Monday 1 April</u> We marched through the streets of Dover for a devil of a distance, or it seemed so with this infernal load up. At last we arrived at a lovely set of buildings, evidently boarding houses or flats before the war</p>
