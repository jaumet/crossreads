"My little wet home in the Trench"To the tune of my little Grey home in the west.
I
I have a little wet home in the trenchWhich the rainstorms continually drenchThere is a dead Turk close byWith his feet to the skyAnd he gives off a beautiful stenchUnderneath in the place of a floorThere is a mass of wet mud and some strawAnd the Jack Johnsons tearThrough the rain-sodden airOer my little wet home in the trench

There are snipers who keep on the goSo you must keep your nappers down lowAnd the star shells at nightMake a deuce of a lightWhich causes the language to flowThen bully and biscuits we'll chewFor tis days since we've seen a stewBut with shells dropping thereThere's no place to compareWith my little wet home in the Trench
