I'm told that the Authorities are cutting out soldiers' parcels, after the Christmas ones.  Although the Lads will feel it generally, perhaps there are a few in particular who will feel it most, I'm sure.
Well, Dad, this is Thursday, I'll keep it and it will form my weekly budget.  Good night.

Gee whiz, you should hear the drum fire at the moment.  It's simply appalling.
This envelope looks tampered with, but it's just one that I opened a week or so ago, and took out the cigarette packets, for it was too bulky.  And I can't afford to waste one, they are so scarce.
Sunday 18th
Yesterday I received Lockhart's of 24th Sept readdressed from A.A.S.C. Parkhouse.  I'm mighty glad to hear that Mum is keeping well.  I see that the shop was able to keep its end up during the strike, and it's nice to notice the cheerful tone of it.
I had a letter from Mrs. Boydon telling me that Alex McDonald was wounded & missing.
Well, Dad, this is not a bad attempt & will keep you going for a little.  There's not much more to mention, except that it's dull and sombre but quite mild.  I'm OK and hope are are well.
Fondest love to all,
Your loving Son
James
