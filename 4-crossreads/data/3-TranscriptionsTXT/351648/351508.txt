I wonder if I'm really worth it Mrs. J.?  All the time & energy you must have spent in that "topping" Cardigan that came today by post, it is easily the finest I have ever seen, & if my thanks could only be equivalent to the comfort I shall get out of it, you would indeed feel yourself properly repaid.  I will not say any more nice things for fear of "turning your head", but just thank you again most sincerely for your kindly thoughts - and for the cardigan too.
But I had meant in this letter not to flatter or say nice things & all that - after your success in enticing even Barrington from his retirement to hear honeyed words & compliments, I thought it about up to me to act as an antidote to all such things that as tend to a swelled head - instead of which I start off & feel constrained or rather cannot help myself from  making you all the worse in spite of myself.
