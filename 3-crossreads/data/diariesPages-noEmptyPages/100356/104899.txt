2nd Bde out this morning officers patrol reported considerable activity along the whole of the enemys line at dawn they commenced their advance on VMM-VGBM which they held at 0600. Their left had in the meantime swung round Sagia enveloped Hill 245 which they held all day, at 1400 the Wellington Mtd rifles made a demonstration against them at VMM-VGBA succeeded in driving them back for 1000 yds captured 16 prisoners on the whole did real well our casualties were 3 killed 3 wounded.
Jacks has made his former line of defence very strong will take some routing out probably his idea is to fall back on these positions should he get a push from there and Hostile planes engaged ours on two occasions, no losses.
