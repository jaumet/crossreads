<p>6/9/16.<br/>It is creepy work observing at night with the lines so close that I can here the Boeches talking in their trench. They have a rifle fixed on this bay too it nearly got me last night the bullet struck the bag I was observing over and filled my eye with dirt. There is no place to sleep here and as the trench is full of muck we are in for a rough time. He only "hates" us with "minnenwerfers" and rifle grenades so things are quiet. We use the periscope on the day posts. A hun surrended with the information that the troops opposite have come from the "Somme Front" too. So the sector is quiet.<br/>7/9/16.<br/>Was releived this evening. Have a good possie in Reserves, so here goes for a good sleep.</p>
