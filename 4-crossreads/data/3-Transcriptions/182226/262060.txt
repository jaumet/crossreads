<p>Monday 7 February, 1916</p>
<p>Sadness in the tucker line. Dinner 1&frac12; biscuits each, 1 tin of jam between 11 men &amp; 1 pannican of tea. (Indigestion is very scarce in this camp)</p>
<p>Another aeroplane came over today &amp; scouted round for about half &amp; hour.</p>
<p>The railway is right up to us now &amp; timber &amp; matting is beginning to come in for the trenches.</p>
<p>We had our tea tonight listening to the strains of music produced by the band. We would rather have them put a little more sugar in the tea or make it an extra tin of jam per day if they are trying to make our meals more pleasant; music is so unsatisfactory as an item of your diet.</p>
