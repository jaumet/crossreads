  
 5th  Had a good long game of cricket yesterday evening, its bonzer here playing of an evening This morning 3 of us went down to the Q M.S & drew 1000 rounds of ammunition, most of which is for the reinforcements, of which we have a few more. That done we were sent over to the bombing school to get some bombs, & while there saw a Stokes mortar in action, they were showing our Brigadier Smythe the working of it, the raiding party is also training here for their little affair which is coming off very shortly. Took our ball down to Hqrs again to fix the puncture up. The 3rd Battalion are out route marching to-day with full packs
