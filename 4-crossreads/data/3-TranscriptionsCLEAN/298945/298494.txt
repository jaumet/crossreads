  
 cheerful greetings of these grateful country folk. 
 On arrival at Longpre we unloaded our baggage in to an Ambulance car, which Birnie had brought for the purpose. & got a ride to L'Etoile a couple of kilos or so away. 
 I am finishing this account off on Friday night, after a long gossip with Monsieur & Mdme over the good war news, & a shave & clean up. We are to commence classes on Monday, & this afternoon I made a notice & prepared a timetable. An order has come out that no men shall sleep in any but authorised billets, but I shall hang on as far as possible & chance orderly room & such terrors.
