Voices were plainly audible which I supposed to be Huns; accountable to the terrific shouting and squealing; Under the worse of extreme circumstances no Australian would act so weakly. Any moment I and my comrades expected a bomb or heavy mortar shell to fall amongst us, which would blow the excavation to atoms. The kind hand of Providence however spared us. As time elapsed the fighting gradually quietened; on the other hand my wounds caused extreme pain, and stiffness set in in every joint.
