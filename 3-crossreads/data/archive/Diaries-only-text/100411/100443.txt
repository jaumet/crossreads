Mon. 9th April
Fairly cold again. Saw Ern Tom again that night they gave us all the latest of home, Coopers etc. Gave them a couple of papers letters to read as they hadn't received any since lobbing.

On the same old job of clearing up the mess table. On nippy morning it makes your fingers very cold handling cold plates. Still more of our lads going over.
