<p>without a single days Training &ndash; my S.C. is young Mackenzie of Duntroon the only Survivor here of seven of them &ndash; There is no single C.O. &ndash; 2nd in Cmd &ndash; my qm N.S.W. Rgms &ndash; Sqn. S.M. Sqn. qm &ndash; ORC left to us. Holswick is in England disabled, and Gollan his successor also gone &ndash; all our Batman evaporated, so we are rather a bag of Newnants, but what then are we all gold &ndash; And the finest on earth &ndash; As of course are all the auxiliaries &amp; N. 3s excepting the 5 Krim shankers who have jobs away and don't get back &ndash; This is one I make to difficulty as the ironical arrangements are bad so bad so far as the cooperation we receive from them in sending the fit back-  They are heard of all over the world. Some in London, India, Florence, Malta, Egypt etc and the doctors help us none &ndash; They have had no experience of the professional coldfector who beats them every time. &ndash; This war knocks the mickeing cover out of all. The F.S.Rgms and all our pet theories &ndash; and so far as I can see war now resolves itself into (1) Superiority of heavy long range Guns with Superior mobility (2) Superabundances of Ammunition for same (3) Numbers of Machine guns (4) Bombs &amp; grenades including day range (800 yds) Trench mortars and short range 40 to 300 yds Mobile Mortars which can be quickly moved from place to place &ndash; in Trenches &ndash; (5) Bayonet (6) and not the least essential pick &amp; shovel (we have not used an entrenching tool here).</p>
