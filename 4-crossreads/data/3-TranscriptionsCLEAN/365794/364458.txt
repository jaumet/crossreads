  
 Monday 25 February 1917 [1918] Here is the last week of Feb. '18 & 6 months since I left Wilga.  Except for all our home trouble it has been a very interesting & instructive time especially the "oldness" of things in Egypt. To decend to mundane things - Have a silk frock made at Chemla Freres Pt. 400 but is nice. Took 4 pts. out for the afternoon.  Garry to Mohammed Ali's mosque then to Anzac Hospital for 4 p.m. tea, they had tickets which entitled them to - 2 fried eggs, tea in a large mug, & large plates of B. & B. milk pudding. Called at Aust. H.Qrs. & drew Pt. 500 then paid dress at Chemla's & home 5.30 p.m., paid Pt. 40 & came on duty. Had game whist on ev. duty, did well.  Ops. 2 for day, pts. 40.  In ch. of ward, sister's day off.
