<p>1917<br/>Jany. 30.<br/>Dinton village, a pretty little place, our feet ringing on the frozen white road and were soon in the country.   We had five miles in front of us and were very glad when we arrived at the camps at Hurdcott, for our feet were very tender.   By this time it was daylight.   No 9 Camp was our destination.  [Inserted a photo titled "No 8, 9 &amp; 10 Camps Hurdcott.   (Summer Time)".]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as we arrived we had breakfast, consisting of turnips.   This looked gloomy but we afterwards learned that the meat supply for the meal had run out before we arrived.   After breakfast we were taken out on the icy parade ground and were roared at by Colonel Steele (known afterwards as the "Food King" but at that time as a B-  B- ).  His speech was something like this: -   You men are not in Australia now.  You've come here to work hard, D &ndash; hard.   You are going to France to fight very soon. (sensation in the ranks)  Got to fight B &ndash; hard, Fight like hell</p>
