<p>complaints our tent took a party out at 3 AM to put things right. But they got caught in a barrage &ndash; mostly gass &ndash; about half way out &amp; had to spend some hours in a dugout then came home without doing anything 2 or 3 got gassed slightly &amp; have been evacuated. A few shell came about the camp but no damage was done. Have done nothing all day</p>
<p>Friday 22nd<br/>Went out at 6 a m &amp; nearly finished the job. Quite a hot day. Put some sand bags &amp; dirt on our humpie to make it more secure from shrapnel &amp; shell splinters- not sea shells &ndash;</p>
