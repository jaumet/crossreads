1st of December Today we enter upon the last month of the year and still the war seems no nearer finishing, surely by the time next December comes round it will all be over and we will be back in sunny Australia.
I had a rag-time guard on last night they were mounted from 10 o'clock that night till 4 in the morning just as well there was no "visiting rounds" or there would have been trouble
We had breakfast about 8 o'clock and moved off at 9 and passed through Heilly a fair sized little town with our Brigade Hqr's in it, just before reaching this village we all had to pull our packs off the "limbers" and march through the town full "marching order", after we had cleared Heilly we threw them on the "limbers" again. It was a very short march and we soon reached our destination (Ribemout).
