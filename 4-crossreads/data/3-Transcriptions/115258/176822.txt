<p>My dear Mother</p>
<p>here I am back at the regt again after my three days instruction in aeroplane signalling. The best three days I have ever spent I think - no work to do - only a small lecture each day - and the rest of the day watching the mechanics at work on the planes and on the last day I went for a fly round. It was a great experience - i was up for about twenty minutes, and went up about 2 or 3 thousand feet. The country looks lovely from up there, all little squares and tracks evrywhere and you can see for miles. its just like sitting in an armchair once you get up a bit, and you only seem to be going about four miles per hour, except when you are just leaving the ground and then you seem to be going a bit. I am posting you 3 photos I got there. They are not supposed to sell them and I had to cut their numbers out of the corner before sending them. Will you please send the one with Harry&#39;s people&#39;s address on it to Mrs Jacob. We had no cardboard to make a second packet. he photos of Jerusalem &amp; Bethlehem are both from an aeroplane. The Jerusalem one</p>
