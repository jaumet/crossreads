<p>Thursday, 7.<br/>Had chat with German prisoners. One quite Americanised.</p>
<p>Friday, 8.<br/>Plates showed "suspicious fracture". Pain getting worse. Marked for England.</p>
<p>Saturday, 9.<br/>Left Boulogne wharf 10.15 am. Arrived Dover 11.45am. Thence train to Chatham 2.30pm. First person I met on board was Gordon Strange. He had hurt his foot on leaving Albert. (Drill Hall, Chatham).</p>
<p>Sunday, 10.<br/>Hospital, the old Drill Hall---one large ward with about 200 beds. Things rough, but homely.</p>

<p>Thursday, 14.<br/>X Ray showed simple fracture coccyx or sacrum.</p>
<p>A Mrs Cuckney came in to see John Reed my next bed neighbour and spoke to me and promised to come in and see me again.</p>
<p>Friday, 15.<br/>Mrs Cuckney came in and brought me books cigarettes, fruit etc. She is the wife of the Borough (Chatham) Treasurer. She is one of the finest women I have met. She not only does things for us fellows but she has the knack of personalizing them. She transmits the virtues of the motive that prompt the deeds to the very deeds themselves. Her gifts "resentissent" of the kindness and sympathy that inspire them.</p>
<p>Monday, 18.<br/>Transferred to Preston Hall, Aylesford, Kent. Left Chatham as a "stretcher case" at 7.pm. Preston Hall about 6 miles from Chatham. Motored.</p>
