25 January, 1916MaadiI rode my mare out this morning, she went well & I think her leg will be alright now - We did some fast "dismount for action" work, it was quite exciting at times, we had a great ride across the desert to shelter when a shower came on us.  This afternoon we got paid, its fine to feel independent once more & to be able to buy ones own smokes.  Johno received a parcel & we had another blow out after dinner of sausages tomatoes, asparagus, & cake.  I am on picquet, they are coming the old trick of putting us L.Corps on as troopers again.  It has been cold today & some sleet fell at one time - nearly all the boys are in town to night. I have put in for a 12 noon pass for tomorrow, hope that I get it.  We are supposed to leave on Friday, that is the latest.
