picked up our own guides we marched into camp about 2.30. There is a grand football field and a game of Rugby was in progress on it. Today we checked the blankets on arrival here and found many interesting things in the bundles as nowadays we have so many old soldiers with us! Our canteen was well installed and ready to do good business as tonight the men were paid. Met Colonel James and walked over to Brigade with him and then had a cup of tea with the General and listened to some of his yarns about Ploegsteert. Returned to Camp for mess and then got busy with interior economy and nearly got suffocated by the sulphurous fumes of French coal burned in a brazier. Hanging over these braziers makes men filthy and with the cold weather they shirk washing. Long hair is also only too prevalent.
