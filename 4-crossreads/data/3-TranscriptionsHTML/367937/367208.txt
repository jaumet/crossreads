<p>Ras-el-tin<br/>1st July<br/>My dear Mother<br/>Have just heard that there is an Australian mail going in a few minutes.  I sent you a registered parcel yesterday; when you receive it open it &amp; fumigate it well before touching it.<br/>The table cloth is for you, the links for Father and the studs for Aunt Katie &amp; the boys if you think they can be devided.<br/>I am afraid that the things are not much but I could not see anything more useful so sent these along.  If the set of studs should not be broken give them to one boy &amp; I'll send the others something else later on.<br/>I have 24 views of lovely Alexandria; will send them next mail: will send the films to the boys.  Hope you got the other photos I sent.<br/>Am having a jolly good time here.  Will write to you next week.  Hope you get the parcel &amp; like the things.  There is nothing to pay on it &ndash; it goes duty free.<br/>Love to Father &amp; the boys.  Suppose they are home now on holidays.<br/>Don't forget to fumigate the parcel.  The cloth is hand worked &amp; guaranteed to wash.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Rob.</p>
