Thursday 27th JulyHad a spell off duty but still found plenty to do fixing up stuff for my section.  Had a run out in the car to a section of the line passing through one village severely damaged by artillery.  Houses were unroofed & tumbling down, large shell holes in the road etc but still a few of the inhabitants remained returning after the strafe was over.
Friday 28thOrderly Sergeant for the day.  Absolutely nothing doing.  A few sick patients admitted & C section bearers relieved A section men at the trenches.  Went to the village picture show known as the "Sailly Empire" at night but saw nothing unusual.  Usual bombardment at night.
Saturday 29th July.Had a spell off duty so did some writing in the morning & went into Estaires in the afternoon.  There was nothing much doing the town being very quiet.  I managed to buy a couple of little things such as postcards & a couple of brooches also had tea with a friend at the 1st A.C.C.H.
