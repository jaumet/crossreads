At noon we commenced embarking troops & at 5 p.m. took in 2000, including officers & 38 Australian sisters who are on their way to England for 3 weeks holiday previous to going to Australia for demobilision.  6 p.m. departed from Salonika for Taranto.  At 10 p.m. wireless messages re mines floating about on our track.  All troops compelled to were lifebelts & strick attention to boat drill & stations. 
 4.3.19 Fine weather prevailed & everyone enjoying themselves immensely.  The usual remark each trip.  They all wish the Indarra was going to take them to Blighty & that she is a very elaborate transport.  No doubt none to equal her in the Mediterean for passenger accomodation.  At noon steaming through the Doca Channal.  At night a concert held in which the majority of the officers & sisters & Tommies throughly enjoyed themselves.  We have some of the troops that got over to Baku oilfield Russia last August & had to evacuate same & cross the Caspian Sea.  A Colonel of the Wareakshire regiment is at my table he being one of the advance party.  We have Brig. General Sally Flood & a French General on board going home.  Quite a treat to have Australian sisters on board.  Seems like being back again in Australia.
