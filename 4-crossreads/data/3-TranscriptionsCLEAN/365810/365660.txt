  
 and very attractive. 
 We had a lovely view from the hotel bedrooms, over the Casino & gardens, to the sea beyond with a portion of coast cliff.  We used to eat our breakfast in leisurely fashion attired very airily & gaze out upon this vista. 
 The tram rides from Monte Carlo to Nice on the one hand & Mentone on the other were along a glorious piece of coast.  We only saw two theatres whilst we were away, one in Paris & one in Nice.  The French acting is admirable.  They really do live their parts and act so naturally.  I enjoyed both of the pieces very much. 
 We met some charming & very interesting people at Monte Carlo & saw the world's Lady Champion tennis player, M'selle Lenglen at Nice.
