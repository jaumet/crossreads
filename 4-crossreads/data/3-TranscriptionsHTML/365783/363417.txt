<p>for you own comfort, convenience &amp; happiness &amp; <u>don't</u> let <u>any</u> expense stand in your way.  It doesn't matter if we go broke we will soon be able to put the pieces together again when we get together again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those damned chaps Norris &amp; Harris &ndash; getting all those frills &amp; furbelows from you &ndash; I would like to kick the pair of them.   I very rarely touch any greens here &ndash; they look very nice &ndash; but I have seen them being washed in the canals en route to market &amp; in Egypt canals &amp; sewers are practically one &amp; the same thing.   We get plenty of London papers here &ndash; I have just been reading the Daily Mirror of 24th March &ndash; we also get the London illustrated weeklies &ndash; the war pictures are very interesting.   I will keep a look out for both Oatley &amp; Somerville &ndash; I have not seen Uncle Joe for some time but intend looking him up first opportunity.  I can well imagine the horror of your last few days on the Demosthenes however it is all over now thank God &amp; I am proud of my brave little wife.<br/>Don't worry about my socks I can darn splendidly &amp; spent about two hours at the job a few days ago.   I have not since worn the socks but they look fine.    The only difficulty I experienced was threading the rope through the microscopic slit at the non business end of the needle.</p>
