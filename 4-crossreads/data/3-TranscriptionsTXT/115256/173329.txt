Thursday 11 March 1915
The first definite indications of a departure at an early date were given to us by the nature of our work all day to-day.  First, our feet were very carefully inspected, and then treated with methylated spirits.  Then a through inspection of the rifles was followed by the issue of certain deficencies including such very necessary articles such as boots, breeches, hats.  This is by far the most hopeful sign of our early departure from Egypt, for God knows how long we have been in completing our kit.
In the afternoon, a general clean-up was ordered.  Forthwith operations of a cleansing nature were commenced on stained tunics, dirty hats etc.  For the most part, the articles looked very much worse as a result of their rough treatment.  But this is all that can be expected from slipshod, camp washing.  So altogether we were not overworked to-day, on account of yesterday's hard day, and also, it is rumoured, in anticipation of some heavy work to-morrow.  Our training is now coming to an end - and nobody regrets it.  You can always have too much off a bad, as well as a good, thing, and we have had quite enough of those heavy, dusty marches across the Libyan desert.  And, in addition, 2/- a day in Cairo, for an Australian, is hopelessly inadequate.  When on leave, he cannot live - he merely exists.  Therefore you hear:  "The sooner we quit Egypt the better".
