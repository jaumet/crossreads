Dear Mrs Hill
Tom met with a slight accident today. He was sitting in his dug out & a piece of shell from some distance flew back & hit him on the arm, &  hip, causing a fair scar in both places. Happily however the wounds were not deep & Tom bore up like a Briton. He of course will be obliged to rest for a few weeks but is in no danger whatever & being physically fit should be back with us in the course of a month at the outside.I am cabling you tomorrow in case Tom hasn't a chance of doing so. The Military Authorities would naturally advise you of Tom being wounded & you might think he is badly "done by". - but on receipt of my cable you will see he is not too bad.Hope all is well with you & yoursWith kind regards to Miss HillYours very sincerelyP E Potts
[Written sideways in the left-hand margin:]We will all be pleased to see old Tom back with us. If I told you all we think of him - you would be getting too proud. All I can say if there were more Tom Hills we would be over the Hills & far away from this I'm sure
