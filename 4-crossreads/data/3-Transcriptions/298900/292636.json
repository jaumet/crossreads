<p>luck but had some fun with a very entertaining M'elle in one of the shops.   I also bought some putty, black paint &amp; a brush with <strike>with</strike> which to finish the Cross.</p>
<p>Friday 22nd Feb<br/>   Fixed up the supplies I drew yesterday &amp; then gave my Cross a second coat of paint.   In the afternoon had a visit from Tommy Gissing, he walking out about 7 miles to see me.   I was very glad to see him as it must be about 8 years since we met.   He was much the same as of old &amp; we had a great yarn.   Wrote my first letter in French at night, to S. Dobbevitch in Paris some effort &amp; much better than I thought possible.</p>
<p>Saturday 23 Feb<br/>   Beautiful day.   Had a go at the rats as they were becoming a nuisance at night.    All I could do was to gas them with acetylene but I fear that it was not very successful.   A lecture</p>
