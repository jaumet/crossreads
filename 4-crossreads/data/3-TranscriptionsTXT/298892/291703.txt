 work of the farm themselves. I have seen numbers of very old women (whom one would expect to find in an arm chair croning over the fire) hoeing the ground,  gathering and carrying large bundles of faggots for firewood or lumping sacks of potatoes and flour on their backs. Others, too, squatted on the floor of rickety old carts driving to or from market. On the road here I saw an old man with snow white hair ploughing with an equally old horse.

Each step represented two distinct movements, one placing the foot on the ground and the next slowly straightening the leg. We were expecting the see the whole caboose, horse man and plough topple over at any minute.

They were soon joined by a few of the women folk of the village who entered into a confab with our hostess. Next morning two old dames arrived and requested our
