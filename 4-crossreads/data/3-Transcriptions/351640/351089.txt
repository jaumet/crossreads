<p>A little while before my arrival a bursting shell from him just below my residence struck eleven men killing one &amp; injuring the others more or less severely. He commands respect.</p>
<p>When walking along the beach yesterday morning I met Joe O'Sullivan, brother to Dora. He is in the force here. As talkative as ever, and as free in his speech favourable or condemnatory of individuals as ever. He told me that one of his younger brothers, Den, has been given a Commission and that he has left Australia. Joe appears to be working hard. Judging from his talk he is as jolly as a sandboy, and with his bearded chin he looks as <strike>savage</strike> wild as a warrior should.</p>
<p>Many an Australian mother or sister would smile if she but saw her son or brother up in the front trenches frying his two pieces of bacon in the lid of a mess tin over a fire <strike>coming</strike> giving heat from a few twigs. Wood for fuel and other purposes is very scarce, because there are no trees growing, shrubs, not more than four feet high, constitute the flora. A few creepers, somewhat after the style of the false Sarsaparilla which flowers in blue during September or October around Moss Vale, twine amongst the shrubs. Men pick up every particle of dry twig and dig out roots, with them to make fires for cooking. Bacon appears to be the most frequently obtainable of meat. Fresh beef is to be had sometimes. <strike>Tinned</strike> Beef in tins is in plenty.<br/>No fifing yet 7-15 a.m. I must get ready for breakfast which is set down for 8.30 a.m.</p>
