Blue Mosque & Saw Service being conducted according to the Koran religion.  This is noted for its Marvellous Tile-work, the whole interior being lined with tiles which cost fabulous prices & are all a pale blue worked out in various designs.  We then visited another Mosque which Napoleon bombarded & saw the wonderful Golden Gates.  These gates are about 100 ft high & 40 ft wide & are studded with Gold, Silver & bronze.  When Napoleon took the town [?] he had one sent to Paris & it is now in the French Museum.  Each gate is worth roughly 400000 & guarded by men & enclosed within Steel Bars.  These guard the Sultans tomb.Every Mosque in Egypt is built over a Tomb of an ex Sultan.
I then came over to Heliopolis & met Cpl C R Palmer & visited Gezirich Island where the Zoo is situated,  had Afternoon Tea & went to Ezbekieh Gardens.  We then went to Church [?] in Kasr-el-Nil & finally returned to camp after a heavy but interesting day
