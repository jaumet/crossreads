  
 up the "line" the Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia, passed through our hands as a wounded prisoner. Sunday, April 1st showery still enjoying ourselves, get up when we like etc. I made a treacle tart but the oven wasn't too good, so Mac & Fred put the tart on top of the stove & it soon started to boil (we had no flour so I used Benges food) my tart was having a rough time, but later the stove (oven) went better so it eventually got baked, but it wasn't bad. Monday very windy some of the tents are down, we got our new pay books today. Tuesday pay day fine but windy having great times Wednesday 4th April raining & heavy fall of snow. Thursday fine & windy Friday heavy fall of snow. Saturday fine & windy in for rations. Sunday lovely day, a bit off color, we are laying in the sun.
