  
 (80) for the night had been a rainy one and where they were there was practically no shelter. The new clay trenches were soon in a bad state. However they did not mind that so much as on the next morning 2 Aug being made by Major Lind to cut hedges, pick up papers etc, in their wet clothes. Having come home earlier I was only muddy but dry so went up to the YMCA pictures in Bailleul 
 4 August. I was sent with 14 other "C" section bearers up to Westhof to give the 4th  F Amb a hand to run the MDS. I was put on as cook's fatigue, which was not a bad job and had its little compensations in the way of tucker of course. Some days were rainy but mostly the weather was good .  9th August. We returned to our unit at Ravelsberg. In the evening I went up to Bailleul to see the "Merry Mauve" divisional follies in the Caisse D'Eparque (French Savings Bank) hall. 10th Aug. walked over towards the Loere road to see Jim Prentice and had a chat.  11th Aug. The dental orderly being ill I was able to fill the gap for Capt.Bennett. 12th Aug.  Dental orderly. Little work. Attended Holy Communion.
