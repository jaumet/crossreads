Then we pass Vernon with its old Tower erected in 1123 by Henry 1 of England then a Norman duke as well To left we pass ruins of Chateauneuf of Phillip Auguste now no longer new. At Rosny I see the Chateau of Rosny Minister of Henry IV & afterwards the residence of the Duchess of Berry. Next comes Mantes - the pretty - where William I was thrown from his horse & subsequently died.
Then we pass Possy the birthplace of St Louis & thereafter it is too dark to see anything till Paris is reached. We arrive about 10 pm.
