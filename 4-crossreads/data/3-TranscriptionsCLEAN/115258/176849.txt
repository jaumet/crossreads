  
 This is Sunday morning - I have been a long time finishing this letter - no church parade to day as the Padre got sick some time ago and has gone to Australia - He was not great sucess as he did not get to know the men. There is a fine Presperterian padre here only he is in the 2nd Regt. He has been in France and is very interesting to talk to and he gets right up into all the scraps here and all the chaps think an awful lot of him. He is a man as well as a Padre and that counts for a lot. I would like to be going to church with you all in the car this morning - You go down to Ulan sometimes don't you? I'm off now to take our horses down to the river for grazing and for me to have a swim so Good bye Father. Hope you are having a good winter when you get this. I am Your loving son, Robert C Wilson
