In afternoon went with Smith, Strahan Sowter to the church at Barford. It is 700 years old has fine carvings on the altar. Has memorials engraved dated 1584, 1618 numbers in the 1700s early 1800s. Altogether was very interesting.

Funniest Easter Saturday that I ever had. Paraded with full equipment, blankets, all belongings changed our quarters to hut 20. Messed about on parade ground for about 2 hours before finally fixed up during the process lumped our belongings all over the place. Weather not so cold feet have not been warm since my arrival in England. In afternoon had route march to Barford. Roads being very hard, are inclined to make the feet sore. Saw aeroplane for 1st time.

Daylight Saving started this morning. Reviewed at 11.30 a.m. by C.G. Wade from N.S.W. some high military officers. Afternoon turned very cold strong wind blowing. Took down laundry (with L.J. Smith) to the same farmhouse. Bought  mess tin full of cocoa from canteen for 3d. to wash down dinner. Plenty bread soup for tea. Treacle dripping rushed as usual but I got my share. Another aeroplane passed over camp this afternoon. Engines of it make tremendous noise.
