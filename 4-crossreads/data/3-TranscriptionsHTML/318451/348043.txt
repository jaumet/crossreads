<p>Wednesday 13th Dec. 1916<br/>Visited Billets this morning.<br/>Dull, cold.  We had a Bible Class here tonight about 7 of us, but it will grow.  We took the parable of the Sower &amp; some very interesting thoughts were presented.<br/>We are expecting a bombardment of the town.</p>
<p>Thursday 14<br/>Raining.  Went to Hospital this morning.  Made arrangements also for place to hold service for Sunday.<br/>I had a funeral also, an Englishman of the Northumberland Fusiliers, Pt. J.H. Rukin.<br/>This afternoon I rode to Steenwerck to see the representative of the Comforts fund re supplies.  They have not yet come to hand.  Difficulties being the carriage &amp; transport.<br/>It was about 7 miles over very bad roads.  Our guns bombarded the enemy.  This afternoon at 6 oclock we were expecting them to reply &amp; shell the Town but so far nothing has come.  This morning's paper (13th) contained the offers of peace from Germany but I am confident nothing will come of it.</p>
