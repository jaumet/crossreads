My darling Eddy, OXO
This French soldier is not so handsome in uniform as most of these soldiers. Their blue is very pretty but is a bad colour for Active Service - it fades so quickly. the little French girls are very quaintly dressed but all seem to grow old so quickly. They have to work so hard now. All children, old men   &  old women in the fields working. The raspberry, currants, gooseberry   &  cherries grow well here. The garden where we live is full of them but we are not allowed to pick them, but manage to have great feeds at night of stewed fruit. Fondest love   &  kisses from XXXXXX Auntie Eadle XX
