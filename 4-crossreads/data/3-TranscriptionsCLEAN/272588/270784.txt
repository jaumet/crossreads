  
 Saturday 12 October Arrive in Glasgow & at once start sight seeing. The Rouken Glen & Botanic Gardens & then University & Art Gallery. Glasgow, in great contrast to Edinburgh, is a city of business, many people in the streets. There are signs of sedition here too, & many seditious notices are chalked about the pavements. Blythswood Hotel. 
 Sunday 13 October A fine day but not clear. A visit to Loch Lomond, Balloch, but no steamers running. No doubt, the lake is beautiful, but I was far from being moved when I saw it.  Possibly expected too much. Balloch Park is very fine. A walk round Glasgow this evening in a crowd of people of which I have seen no equal.
