<p>I got some huge star-fish &ndash; weird &ndash; red tuberculated beasties &amp; they now lie drying in my cabin &ndash; By the way its quite impossible here in Rabaul to get \p-cards &ndash; photos or any curios &ndash; It's also far too hot to go into the Bush even if allowed &ndash; When we got back we found our fellow officers &ndash; inboard &ndash; very lively &ndash; very cheery  &amp; good hearted &amp; shouting drinks for us - . I had a drink &amp; then awoke to the fact that they'd all put in time at Bridge &amp; Cocktails &amp; the Cocktails accounted for much &ndash; never mind &ndash; we put in a good, good, eveng in true 'roaring ranting' naval fashion &ndash; By Jove, this is a life on its own &ndash; The man on the beach knows nothing of this life &ndash; of course on a gunboat with a small crowd of us, we must all pull together &amp; this we Fantomians do with a vengeance &ndash; We've improved the mess as much as <u>we can</u> &amp; for the rest say nothing but when we get a chance to get a meal &ndash; outside &ndash; we take it &ndash; True sailor philosophy.</p>
