 In the afternoon we went out of the college, two by two, with flags.  We wandered over the town, stopping all vehicles.  We went till the Place of Concorde, took a big gun (there was an exposition of material taken to the enemy) which we drew and brought in the college.  The following day, we brought a second gun which we took also at the Place of Concorde.  Now we have at the college three big guns and a machine gun.
