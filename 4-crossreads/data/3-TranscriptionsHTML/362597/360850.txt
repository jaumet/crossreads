<p>Wednesday 5.1.16 (14)<br/>A glorious day. Sports held in the afternoon. We invited all the Nurses to see them. Ellis won his heat in the Sack Race &amp; so did Billy. Ellis &amp; I won our heats in the Potato Race. Our Tug-of-war team is in the final.</p>
<p>The ship's crew rigged a big canvas bath about 15 feet by 10 feet. The pillow fight took place on a beam swung across this bath. It was the best pillow fight I have ever seen. The finals of all the races will have to be run some other day.</p>
<p>After tea everybody had to go into the Bath. Mr Dean our W.O. went over to tell the Boys</p>
