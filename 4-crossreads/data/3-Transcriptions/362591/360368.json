<p>I received your letter describing Mr. Curtis' aircraft incident last night.  What a providential thing that it was no worse.  Dorothy's description of the accident was quite exhilarating.</p>
<p>There is every indication (though nothing definite) that I shall need a working acquaintance with the French language at a very early date provided a certain transfer does not eventuate.  The transfer which might affect it is my transfer to the 56th Bn.  I have been a <u>temporary</u> Captain now since 8th October which is a week over 4 months and have been a Coy Commander since 2nd October and yet there appears to be no effort made to give me my permanent rank.  Beiers is now on the strength of the Coy again &amp; is detached.  There is another officer who may at any time be pitchforked in on to the Coy strength senior to me so when they asked me if I would be willing to take a Coy in 56th, I said yes.  I realise that I am giving up many things but it seems to have a balance of advantage.  I think it will probably mean that I go over in a few days to the new Battalion &amp; will be left there when</p>
