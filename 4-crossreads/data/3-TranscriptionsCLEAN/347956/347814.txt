Dec 7th
could ever imagine a place to be, but we struck plenty of Frenchmen & had a good-time; we also struck up a yarn with some of the New Zealand troops, also Australians from different boats & found out we have been having just as good a time as any of the other boats, some of the boys had a fair time for awhile riding donkeys & as we all had spurs on, the donkeys got nothing;
About 11 oclock we ran against a picquet off the Suffolk.  we struck up a yarn with them & found they were from Kensington (2nd Battalion)  I enquired after Morgan Welsh but they did not know him.  we came on board about midnight after having a good time & it was quite a treat to be on land again.  7 weeks & a day since we walked on land & we are quite satisfied to leave the boat
