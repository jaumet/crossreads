<p>By the way &ndash; Commonwealth Bank, London, has just written me that my allotment of pay is coming to hand regularly, so you needn't worry any about that.  I ought to be quite a small millionaire before long as there is nothing to spend much on here.  The only thing is tucker and the local inhabitants are nearly as bad as the "Gyppies" when it comes to living on soldiers, but we don't grudge it to them after seeing what they must have gone through &ndash; homes and everything wiped out of existence.</p>
<p>Also one feels entitled to live well here, at any rate in the tucker line, our last two meals finished with strawberries and they were some strawberries believe me, for which we had to pay four francs.</p>
<p>The weather has been rather vile and we've been slipping and sliding from day to day nearly up to our necks in mud and would all like to see the Australian sun again.  I've been wearing both sheepskin and overcoat at night so Lord only knows what we'll want here in the winter.  The men have only one blanket now and the authorities wanted to withdraw that too, but we've managed to block it so far.</p>
<p>Will write again shortly if we go for a spell, but if we start moving will probably have few opportunities.  In any case you will know from the papers if there is anything "big" doing.</p>
<p>From Mater's letters you don't appear to have been getting my letters.  Can't understand it, as I've written regularly.  Letters to Auntie and Granny I addressed to Keating's Hotel as their letters were headed "Woodend" and until the earlier letters came to hand I didn't know they were at McKenzie's.</p>
<p>Love to all<br/>Myrton.</p>
