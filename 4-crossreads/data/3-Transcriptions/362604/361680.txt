<p>is not so lazy as He was at Home.  We have had perfect weather until yesterday when a strong breeze rose which is still blowing fairly strongly.  We have had no rain except for a shower this morning &amp; everything is very dry.  Ellis has gone out for a walk but I have to stay on Duty this afternoon.  One of my Patients tried to "cut His allowance" off.  He has only a small bit left.  He is mad &amp; one of my Boys has to take His turn watching Him, &amp; two others are on leave.  I may go to Church to-night</p>
