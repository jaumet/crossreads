<p>If Barringfather the Bystander had one of his men here he would get plenty of amusing sketches-  Yesterday when the enemy were shelling us one of our men filled an old Billy Can with Green Dates &amp; when a shell burst he threw the can up in the air the Dates falling around scattering the men.<br/>Our interpreter who is a Xbred is very funny- 'His heart is very sad for Bully beef"   He cannot eat in peace, the atmosphere is not clear &amp; if he can find the man who recommended him this job with the Australians, he will kill him <u>directly!</u><br/><strike>Letter from Mother &amp; JOE 11/6/16 C Fetherstonhaugh ditto &amp; I acknowledged Ligmolene</strike></p>
