 Saw a great flock of bird today they look fine as they wheel backward and forward across the sky . This even all the platoon had to take their shortag . There was some heavi fire last night which could be heard quit plain down here although we are so far away from the line . Today Jock Macki went to the Bomber , he had charg of them befor he just suit the bomber and what old Jock doe not know about bomb is not worth know . 23rd Was act S.M. again today and I had rather a ticklish job on for the Batt . had to be on parad on account of the Court Martial which had to be read out to the whole Battalion , but I got on alright ,
