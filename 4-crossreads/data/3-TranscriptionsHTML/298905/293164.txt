<p>anything at<strike>t</strike> all interesting in it it seems just a rough &amp; tumble to me after being used to "Australian Rules" which I consider is a far superior game.<br/>6th. Went on a fatigue to Sailly this morning &amp; it rained cats &amp; dogs all the way, when I had been there about an hour or so, a chap came up from Headquarters with a note to say that I had to go back to my billet, as I was to go on my leave to-night, you should have seen me drop the pick which I was using  When I got back I reported to our Captain, he told me to pack up &amp; be ready to move off at 6 oclock  I was also informed that I had a stripe to put up, so the day wasn't a bad one for me</p>
