<p>In holts with Vet Officer.  Made a complaint about shoes.  Lieut. Archer's horse was shod at 11 oclock, went lame in two hours, supposed to be pricked, Vet Officer got another Farrier to have shoe removed.  The Vet Officer told me the horse was lamed in shoeing, I asked him if it was pricked, all he said was it was lamed in shoeing.  He said, in answer about the shoes they were made that way on purpose, I said it may appear so, to a man that learned it out of a book.  He threatened to put me under arrest.</p>
