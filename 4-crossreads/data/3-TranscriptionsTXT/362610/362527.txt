Tuesday 7 Nov. 1916A most miserable day to adequately describe which would be difficult. The rain was icy cold & drove in everywhere, falling in torrents occasionally, then giving place to hail, then to sleet. The mud was worse than ever & one felt full of pity for the poor frontline fellows. The General did not go up the line so I was hardly out at all.
