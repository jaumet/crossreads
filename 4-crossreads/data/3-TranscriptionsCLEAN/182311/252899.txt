 MY DEAR ONES, 
    It must be very nearly a month since I wrote you anything like a long letter, although several times I've sat down and scrawled to you the wish that all are well and the fact that I am well too.  Yes, it has been a very busy time, quite a big task since the 23rd of March, when in some haste we left our pleasant rest billets in a happy sheltered valley  ^  Les Seninghem near Desvres,  far from the war and started out to stop the advance of Brother Bosche, when the 5th Army were attacked. 
    It seems the fate of our Division that our period of rest is never completed but is always curtailed, and the Division moves off to some scene of warlike activity. 
    To the lads, the move came as no surprise for they were expecting a stunt, had been ever since a few days before they had been served with a ration of Australian Bunny.  By some strange coincidence the Rabbit Ration quite uncommon as a soldier's food has always been issued before a "stunt" - it cames before Messines, before Passchendale, it came before some of our raids and just as soon as we saw it while in rest, well, we all knew what to expect. 
    And we were ready too, for the weeks in rest had been spent in organization, in training and in the full-est preparation, so that we were absolutely fit and prepared so that we would be fit for anything, mobile in the strictest sense of the word.
