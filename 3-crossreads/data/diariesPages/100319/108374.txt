23/9/18 Cappy
There were several football matches in the afternoon. For mess Dr. Simmonds and Jack arrived and stayed afterwards to a game of bridge. The night was cold frosty and moonlit and the drone of aeroplane engines high up was very audible. The rumble of transport very noticeable on all the roads as American divisions move up. They sleep by day and move up by night. All indications point to an early and large operation on this front. The heavy machinery (in the way of large pieces) is also to be seen on the roads. The Billjims soon seem to get wind of it if there is anything doing at all. Their sources of information are varied numerous.
