Dear Mrs Robertson
Many Thanks for the papers you have sent.  They have been very acceptable in our few leisure moments.  Have been fairly busy for the last month or so as no doubt you have seen by the papers and does not look as if things are likely to alter for a long time yet.  Where we have been for some time is right in the centre of where the advance has taken place &amp; the state of the country round about is absolutely indescribable.
