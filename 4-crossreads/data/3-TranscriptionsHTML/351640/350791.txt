When I came to my room stepped on to the balcony, and looked out into the night the atmosphere was perfectly clear, the sky was a pale blue, the great big pale faced moon was like a silver globe high up above the grand pyramid, the stars paled by the brilliance of the orb of night, twinkled twinkled as of yore, the margins of the 3 large stone structures were silhouetted gainst the eastern sky; the walls, the road, the physical features of the edge of the plateau were clear cut under the clear moonlight, the lamps of several motor cars glowed athwart some little space from close to the base of Cheops, peoples voices gave sonorous evidence  of those who had come from Cairo ticed by the splendid asphalt road with the unrivalled sandstone masses as its end.  No wonder the Egyptian is content, unmoved by the passing show, a religious philosopher, the heritor of his eight thousand year old race.</p>
