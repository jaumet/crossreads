 My Dear Hal 
 I trust these few lines find you enjoying the very best of good health as it leaves me at present. I received a letter from Mother dated 25th June &amp; Mother said you were writing also I never received your letter Teen old boy &amp; I felt a bit downhearted when it never turned up. Well Hal I hope you will shake off that tired feeling &amp; drop me a line every mail. You know old man what it is like over here when a letter does not turn up &amp; you are expecting one. You &amp; I were always the best of Pals, we're we not! I often walked a good way over here to have the pleasure of seeing you dear old dial.
