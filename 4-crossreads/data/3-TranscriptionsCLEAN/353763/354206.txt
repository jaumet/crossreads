  
 In India - in the rice fields with a child on their back guiding them  -  Great lead colored -  unwieldy brutes - bulls horizontally horned  -  They scratch their sides in the most delicate manner with just the tip of their horns  -  Then we struck what I was sure of interest & up I went - a lot of bee hive - circular huts - built of straw - raised 5 to 8 feet from the ground & with a deck floor & steps up  -  It was a native compound & in we went & explored  -  Lots of natives - males mostly some children  -  I saw no women  -  They were all very friendly & evidently were connected with the gardens  -  They had a lot of mongrel dogs - like dingoes  -  Iron pots  -  They smoked & yabbered away  -  The huts are circular 
 [drawing of hut]   -  straw for sides straw for roof  -  They'll burn fast enough & must be hot shops
