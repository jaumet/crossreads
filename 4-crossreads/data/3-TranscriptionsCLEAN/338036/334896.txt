 Saturday 5 To Div Baths at Steenwerck towards evening & after a tea of eggs & chips we spent the night sauntering round the town until dusk.  Soon after arriving back at Pont d'Achilles there commenced one of our liveliest night to date.  Fritz commenced a terrific bombardment and contrary to custom the shells seemed to be all falling in the supports & roads behind the trenches.  I proceeded to rear of Camp & from there I got a good view of shrapnel shells bursting about 440 yds away.  It was O.K. while they were that far away but whizy [?]
