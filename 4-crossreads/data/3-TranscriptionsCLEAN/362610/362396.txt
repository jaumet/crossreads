  
 Thursday 29 June 1916 Fine again & by evening once again possible to walk about in comfort. About midday Fritz again shelled all round our billet, putting over 57 shells of which 20 were "duds", one of which landed safely on the parapet without exploding. Very little damage done again. When examining the place later we found one of the shells which had lodged on the top of the parapet & failed to explode. It was a 4.2, painted blue with a yellow band near the nose. During the night heavy firing again kept us awake for awhile, combined with a gas alarm which came to nothing.
