2/5/18 Warloy
Left Warloy at 10.17 a.m. with the band playing. It was hot marching but the men stood it well. Our route lay through Vadencourt Contay Behencourt and Montigny. The country was, in looks, delightful and a sheen of green covered all the trees. Delightful dips and hollows in which nestle peaceful villages. The roads were busy with many troops and a lot of transport. Just outside Montigny we pulled up and had lunch. All the roads and bridges are mined. Some whippet tanks passed us going at a good rate of speed. They look comically like ships as they cruise along. Passed through little villages down towards Pont Noyelles. The drivers of artillery and other units are bivouacked on the terraces of the ground. Passed through Pont Noyelles and gave the men a spell before we swung into Querrieu to the strains of the Band. All our packs and valises were here awaiting us and all were soon in billets. Mine is a fine and comfortable room with a most elaborate bed and some daring pictures. Here again we have an example of a house full of good furniture abandoned to ruin. The people according to Leon Barbier are much upset about the way their places have been pillaged. One lady says that in 1914 the Huns came ? they paid for all they took ? now everything is taken and ruined without any excuse or compensation. After mess had a conference re our defence scheme. Our task is to C.A. if Villers Bretonneux is lost. An air raid being made on Amiens and many searchlights were concentrated about on certain sectors of the sky.
