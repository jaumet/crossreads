<p>the number of rumours that are going round as to our new destination, but I fancy it will all end on the Somme again. Some big bets are being made, &amp; excitement prevails. So far it is not known to anyone at all. The Brigades are now out of the trenches &amp; I believe we go to Wipinhoek tomorrow. This is a Rail Head &amp; may mean entraining for any point.</p>
<p>The motor column is now delivering to us from Caestro &amp; it is much easier for our working.</p>
<p>Several flights of aeroplanes crossed today towards the German Lines, evidently on a raid. No doubt we will get their reprisal tomorrow. I hate their aeroplanes to come across as not only do you risk their bombs, but our guns start throwing shells all over the place, &amp; we get the benefit of the falling cases or pieces of steel. I have seen the whole sky one mass of smoke explosions.</p>
