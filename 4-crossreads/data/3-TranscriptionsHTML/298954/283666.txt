<p>1918<br/>Sun 23rd June<br/>Bernard, mon ami francias, in a cooking lesson revealed the virtues of common burdock as a vegetable.   Even the Russians don't eat that so I was able to find plenty growing around the camp.   I cut some over by the Russian barracks &amp; boiled it.<br/>It was splendid;  just like spinach.</p>
<p>Mon 24th<br/>We are now living by ourselves in a deserted barrack.    We added McCarthy to our mess, but it was then overweighted with Temperament.   McCarthy &amp; McGrath were inseparable for a week &amp; then had a fight, <strike>with</strike> McCarthy grabbing a table-knife to end matters.   Whittaker shrieked;   dear old George just looked up from his book &amp; calmly watched.   McC has gone back to his barrack;   while McG fights (verbally, almost physically) with me in his stead.   We also were inseparable till McG. told me that the McGraths were the Royal Clan of Ancient Ireland &amp; I remarked that every Irishman I had ever met, no matter how haggishly ignorant, always laid claim to be descended from kings.</p>
<p>Anyhow, today we were called out on Appel and asked to keep a watch on the lavatories to prevent Russians stealing the timber of which the hygienic abortions are built!</p>
