<p>17<br/>Guard keep watch on the Public Wharf. The "Berrima" and "Encounter" weighed anchor shortly before sundown &amp;, accompanied by the "Australia" &amp; "Montcalm", returned to Rabaul. We feel a wee bit lonely now that we are left alone but console ourselves with the thought that "Robinson Crusoe" &amp; "The Swiss Family Robinson" were infinitely worse off than we are.<br/>Friday 25th : I today went to inspect a motor ketch discovered by one of my L's. It proved to be the "Lili", about 40 ft overall, &amp; well adapted to our purpose. As is usual, however, in such cases something vital was missing. We therefore decided to sail her back. The "Lili" was anchored off a plantation managed by Mr. Hoffmann who is apparently away at Rabaul, at least that is what I understood the overseer (a Malay) to say. We searched the native huts &amp; the owner's quarters for firearms, and soon had a collection of knives, bayonets, revolvers, flasks of powder etc. The natives stood back while my men with bayonets fixed passed through the dwellings looking for any thing that could be classed as munitions of war. We took only the revolvers, powder, and a bundle of charts.<br/>When the niggers saw that no harm to them was intended they loaded up the men with cocoanuts, pawpaws etc. Returning onboard the "Lili" we hoisted the sails (Jib, mainsail &amp; mizzen) and with one of the niggers at the helm weighed anchor. He appeared to know the channel very well, and I can tell you it took some knowing. Shoals are scattered broadcast in this beautiful but treacherous harbour. In some places it is impossible to run on a course</p>
