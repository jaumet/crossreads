I have not been far into the wilder for some time but the most of the leas now is in the last stage of ruin a bush call bur bush has taken possess of most of the black soil area it is veri dens and in some place about 4 feet high it is a absolut imposs to see a wallabi in it . it cover all the open space where we got shoot as the wallabi went from one scrub to anoth . there was practic none of it here when we where here first .
