<p>&quot;International Post&quot;&nbsp; South of Villers. Brettonaux after Capture by Australian Troops.</p>
<p><u>FRANCE</u>.</p>
<p><u>About June 1918</u>.</p>
<p>Dear People</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During some recent activities an Australian brigade was on the right flank of the British front, and therefore in touch with the left flank of the French.&nbsp; The infantry was in the closest/liaison and this led to fraternization, for both of these fighters have the live-liest appreciation of each other&#39;s fighting qualities, and many humorous incidents resulted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; An Australian Adjutant was heard to declare that after the first experiment he only sent God-Fearing tee-total runners to the French H.Q., any others came back absolutely &quot;stonkered&quot; for the Froggy was very generous with his wine issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; From the debris of battle, the French had salved a British Light Trench Mortar, one which fires so rapidly that usually eight shells are visible in the air at once.&nbsp; It was the delight of the French to &quot;wangle&quot; the Ammunition from the A<s>i</s><sup>u</sup>ss<s>u</s><sup>i</sup>es and then get the &quot;Toute Suite Cannon&quot; (as they christened it) into action, exclaiming excitedly as they loaded &quot;Bon for Allemagne&quot; - &quot;Bon for Allemagne!&quot;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The French gunners were noticed, after a wine issue had been completed and consumed, turning without orders and by common consent to their 75&#39;s and without gun drill but with hearty good will, sending rapid salvoes over to their hated foe.</p>
