<p>My word the fighting in France must be something awful at the present time, I think this must be the beginning of the end if we can only hold them, which we all think that thy can.</p>
<p>Well I think I will close for the present by sending you my very best love and Good Wishes. Take every Care of yourself.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Yours loving<br/>W. Weaber</p>
<p>Kisses for you<br/>X X X X X X<br/>X X X X X</p>
