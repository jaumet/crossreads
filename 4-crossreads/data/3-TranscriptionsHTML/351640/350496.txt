<p>Can any one make reasonable answer?  Books might be written upon the subject and when one reached the end of reading them no answer would have been found.

<p>5 a.m. 5-1-15. Since we came north of the Equator I have been anxious to view the sky in the early morning.  Waking a little after 5 o'clock, I put on my slippers &amp; kimona, mounted the stairs, reached the main deck, looked to the south and there saw the pointers and the Southern Cross, both standing out brightly in a somewhat clouded sky.  The morning star &ndash; wabun anung [ahnung] &ndash;, was a particularly bright blue planet straight above me, Venus.  The Northern heavens were too clouded for me to get a glimpse at the great bear, but some other morning this can be seen.  It is now about 12-15 pm. on Tuesday with you.  We pass Westward.</p>
