These lifebelts are a dam nuisance they take up so much room we can't pass each other comfortably anywhere.  we keep forgetting to allow for the lifebelt and get jammed in the narrow passages nor can we find room enough to sit at the tables, however the tucker is so bad that it reduces our bulk & tends to equalize matters.
