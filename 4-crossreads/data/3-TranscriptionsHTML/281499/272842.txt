<p>This morning instead of our usual parade, we had lectures on "open order fighting" &amp; etc.<br/>After this was over those men who had not voted on the conscription affair were hauled up again &amp; recorded them, one thing about this seems very peculiar to me, there are any amount of chaps among us who have seen quite a lot of service, &amp; yet because they are under 21 they are not allowed to vote while people out in Australia who have never seen a shot fired in anger are allowed to vote on this important question.  I guess the people in Australia will get a terrible shock when they get our return for the feeling is very much against conscription."<br/>This afternoon on parade a message</p>
