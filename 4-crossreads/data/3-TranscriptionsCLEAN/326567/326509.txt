waiting awhile, nobody came so I investigated through the building & could find nobody & was just leaving when in walked a dilapidated Man & asked of whom I wanted, after telling my wants he served me & told me that the owner cleared out as the Germans were shelling the Town, the civil population are in a great state when shells are falling although the Town is full of Soldiers & vehicles of all sorts & they don't seem to mind. I went along afterwards to the Y.M.C.A. Building for a read when all of a sudden a large report of a Gun was plainly heard then a Whizz of a shell approaching & then a terrific explosion in the Air, & then everybody rushes out to see where the shrapnel has fallen, anyhow if any damage was done it was over to the West near the station, I learnt later that a High Explosive had fallen on the road opposite the Railway Station & had struck a Motor Van, killing the Driver & threw out his companion on to the Roadway, seriously injuring him also another shell
