July 31 Saturday 1915Working till 3 PM sorting all day feeling little better
Trams: The Trams in Alexandra are inferior in comfort & running to our Brisbane Service. Some are Double Deckers, but the discomfort of getting up & the low roof, then the extra vibration is much against this build. The Tram lines are laid with as many curves & corners that the passenger is heaved from one side to the other & is in constant dread of being at times thrown out. In starting the whole thing goes off with a jerk, & it is quite a balancing feat to keep oneself from being sent into the corner.
August 1 Sunday 1915Went to hear Pres Minister in morning & after dinner walked round to Russell Soldiers Home had a light tea there then went to hear Methodist chaplain at night.
August 2 Monday 1915Packing up all day & taking mail & kit to station went & said goodbye to Victor Convas & the friends in the Russell Soldiers Home. Feeling better.
