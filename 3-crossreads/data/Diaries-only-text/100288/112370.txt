Sighted Arab dhow (small sailing ship) in distance on Starboard bow at 2.15 pm. Had pleasure of seeing it through telescope; quite a treat for we have not seen either land or a boat since leaving Australian shores. Passed Cape Guardifui 5.15 pm just visible on port bow; very hazy. Weather getting cooler days shorter. Very bad head-ache today. At noon we had travelled 6550 leaving 1746 to go.
