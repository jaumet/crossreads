<p>or four days. Bombs almost amongst our G.S. wagons, as they were coming along the road. Our journey today 23 miles</p>
<p>26-2-1918<br/>Frosty morning. Cold day. Two guns gone into action. Range 7.500 yards, over 1,000 yards out of range. No shooting just at present. If we want to range, our Infantry are cleared out of the trenches. We are to be ready if the Huns attack. An enemy aeroplane brought down at 4.00A.M. Machine out of control. We are again camped in a Chateau, or rather outside one. Near the noted scotchmans wood</p>
<p>27-2-1918<br/>Three more guns gone into action this evening, making in all five. A bit of a stunt on last night, taking a pill box. Just now 8-30 P.M another stunt is on. We move from here to our proper wagon line on the 3rd of next month. Today we are supposed to regester our range. Tonight raining.</p>
