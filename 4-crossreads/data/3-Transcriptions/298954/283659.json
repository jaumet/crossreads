<p>On the chilly beach with dozens of others (from Captains down) I manage to get a fire in going in the old bogey &amp; juggle the two billies over the fire till the porridge &amp; tea is ready (I have progressed far since that day long ago in Karlsruhe when I looked helplessly at the ingredients of a pie.)</p>
<p>After breakfast (our barrack is dormitory, - salle-a-manger, &amp; lounge all in one) I "wash-up", peel the potatoes for dinner &amp; am then free to lounge about and gossip with the chefs next door till 10.45 or so.</p>
<p>Till noon I am busy preparing "dinner"; today's menu being:-<br/>"Camp Pie" (a tinned substance) boiled potatoes<br/>Compote of rice and apricots (dried)<br/>Bread and dripping<br/>Tea.</p>
<p>This menu is exceptionally ample, packets being plentiful at present.</p>
<p>My compote was much admired;  I was quite proud of it.</p>
