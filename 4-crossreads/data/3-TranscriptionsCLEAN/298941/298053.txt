the panomaric view of the flat country all around, & , but for the mist, would probably have seen quite ten miles all around. As it was we could make out Mt des Cats, a vague Kemmel, Hazebrouck, Steenvorde, & small villages scattered round.It was wonderful to see the perfectly straight roads radiating from the hill. It reminded me somewhat of Box Hill
