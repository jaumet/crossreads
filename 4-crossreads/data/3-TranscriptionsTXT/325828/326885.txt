By to-night's mail I also received a letter from Uncle Jez at Lord HoweWe landed out here about 7 o'clock on Saturday night.  The next day we were hard at it all day putting down new horse line, erecting tents & straightening up things in general.

The cold winds catch us as we are camped on the top of a slope.I do hope that Father is better for the sea trip & change that he had, for it is a hard time for him at present.In the letter from Uncle Jez he talks about coming to Sydney & seeing if he can get over the age difficulty & enlistingThis leaves me in splendid health & I sincerely trust you it will find you the same.Father may remember Parkinson (I think his Father was in the Department) who used to be in the 6th class with Clem Chapman Southee, & the others.  He is here as Captain, but he doesn't remember
