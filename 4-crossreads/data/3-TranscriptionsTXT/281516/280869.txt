Woke up with a sore throat and felt very unwell so slept in till 0900. All day felt cold and shivery. Big orderly room and got substantial penalties inflicted. Last night the noise in the loft kept me awake - so many drunks returning and doing dances on the ceiling. Roared a bit and they kept quiet. Got the marching orders for our march to Fleurbaix 5 minute intervals between companies until the crossing of railway near Bac St. Maur when an advance by platoons at 2 minute intervals takes place. If dark connecting files at intervals of 4 paces promise to be necessary and the march should be an interesting one.
Very cold raw day after heavy rain last night. All our company transport marches in rear of the company - a cooker (on which I hope to have some hot tea ready when we reach our destination). G.S. wagon with blankets and kits and officers luggage. Left at 6 pm on our 6 mile march and found it very hard to keep in touch, at one time only 3 men in one platoon were left all the others being connecting files. An impressive slow silent march getting closer every instant to the enemy trenches.
Reached Fleurbaix about 10 pm and struck good billets taking over from the Sussex Regiment. Their officers very decent and put us up to all the ropes. Had great trouble on the march watching intercommunication and had to keep riding up and down the line. Roads blocked by fills dropped but once very nearly took wrong course.
The billets are fairly comfortable and better than the last we had. Stores mess &c already on the scene. Other officers fixed up further down the road near the stand to Company. On morning off some men were very drunk and having them under guard looked bad. Still feeling unwell tonight and would like to sleep in tomorrow but no such luxury in these times.
