  
 the last few months I have seen families driven from their home time out of number, homes that they have occupied for the last 40 years, but they do not quell or cry they take it as a matter of course & they get a living "somewhere in France". to me George they are playing the biggest part of the war. 
 The Australians are playing a great part nothing will break their heart & French are just beginning to realise & the Australian to the French at present are great heroes and they just deserve it. Well George I dont want to boast too much about our boys but believe me Australia can be proud of them. At present I am keeping OK. Remember me kindly to Jennie & mr & mrs Lutge & other friends from Your Sincere Friend Les
