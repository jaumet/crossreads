<p>their bayonet charge.  This action was the severest we have yet had, the brunt of it falling to our Bde. who held the main position in line, &amp; only 173 strong with 8 machine guns.  Our casualties were very light.  Huns &amp; Turks would not mix with one another in our lines, the Turks continually jeering at the Huns.  When the prisoners left for Jerusalem, the Huns only were allowed to strip &amp; bathe in the wadi Aujir, yet for doing this, our men have received severe punishment &amp; a few N.Z. as our drinking water is pumped from this same stream.  A staff officer was responsible for this action, which was the means of causing strong remarks from our men.  Stayed on post all night only three men on a gun.  Enemy shelled our line, causing few casualties.</p>
<p>15:  Small bodies about, taking in the wounded, leaving the dead for our men to bury. Col. Bell &amp; Mjr. Hudson got a good haul of notes from the wounded &amp; captured this morning.  9.2 naval gun has been brought up to Red Hill &amp; is causing a lot of damage round the camps &amp; dumps in our rear.  Remained on post but no sign of movement except enemy bearers collecting their wounded.</p>
