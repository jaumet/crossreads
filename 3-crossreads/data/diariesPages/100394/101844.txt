Posted letters home, Lou & Iris, Uncle Jim, Ada Jones, Moll, and P.C. to Lorna. Had 3 from home, Moll, Eva in England) Mr. Wallis, Chas, Montague, Lizzie and Ethel. I am mess orderly today and am going into Fleurbaix soon to get some tucker as we only have dry bread and tea on issue.

August 18
Wrote Lizzie, Mrs. Fountain, Eva Owen Wallis, & F.S. card home. Had another letter each from home and Ethel and wrote home. Am on F.O. duties tomorrow and am going to waggon lines for a week on Sunday. I saw the best bit of manoeuvring I have ever seen in my life this after noon in an aeroplane driven by the mad Major.

Had to go up to F.O. again today and we had rather a lively time of it as we had several stunts during the day and Fritz retaliated rather severely but did very little damage considering the quantity of ammunition he used.

August 20
Got back from F.O. about 11 a.m. Jack Nethersole and I came down to the waggon lines tonight for a weeks spell and landed here about 11 p.m. I was hit on the arm by a flying piece of shell on the way down but it only bruised me slightly.
