<p>Dearest Bess,</p>
<p>I sincerely trust you have not given up hope entirely of ever receiving a note, but at last I deemed it advisable to write you, in order to avoid that catastrophe with which you threatened me. &nbsp;I would indeed cause me great grief (not to mention to excruciating agony of such a proceedure) to have that threat carried out, especially by my wife (or wives). &nbsp;I must apologise for running away so soon last Saturday (from the phone) but I was in danger of being mobbed the people waiting, who at various intervals requested me to &quot;write the ---- rest down&quot;, &quot;buy the phone&quot;, &quot;ring off&quot;, &quot;bring my bed&quot; etc. &nbsp;I hope you enjoyed your little dance on Saturday evening, and that you did not lose your way home - also expect that no late tram was run (12.30 <u>a.m</u>.) when the tramway people heard that I was in camp. &nbsp;Will have it commissioned again however, as it is&nbsp;</p>
