advised that we leave here on Sunday next for Alexandria, which is a 12 hours train journey from here.Our Company will go in 6 trains, I myself taking charge of the 5th leaving here at 12 midnight.Today has been a regular fiend, as if mocking us during our last few days stay.The sand is whirling about one can scarcely see. The flies are also very bad.Tomorrow will be a very busy day in dismantling the Camp, so I will turn in early.

This is absolutely the worst day ever I have experienced in Egypt that is saying a good deal. It is impossible to see 5 yards ahead of you very difficult to breathe.There is also a plague of flies ones life is a misery. Thank Heavens we only have another day in this Hell of a place.We are working hard to dismantle our Camp tomorrow we march out, What a relief to leave Sinaii Peninsular behind us. I have had nearly a month here now, it has been the worst month of my life, one that will live for ever in my memory.
