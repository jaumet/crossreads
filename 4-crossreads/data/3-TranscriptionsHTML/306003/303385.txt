<p>8-6-16<br/>Thurs 8th<br/>Heard today that the Russians have scored a victory; also that Lord Kitchener &amp; his staff had gone down on H.M.S. Hampshire &amp; no one saved stiff luck for K. but nobody here thinks it will affect the war much;  received a few remounts today to make up our strength  of horses;</p>
<p>A good many men have been caught asleep on duty lately, &amp; Major Granville lined the N.C.O's up today &amp; told us to try to stop it, as the next case brought before him would have to be dealt with harshly;  One night coming back from Qatia our Camel Transport &amp; a guard came right  into camp through the 3rd L.H.R. outposts without being challenged<br/>Trench digging progresses &amp; fatigues appear to have no end;  It is reported the Turks have given us 24 hours to move the hospital.</p>
