 Suppose Mother will be having a birthday cake soon. I wish I could have a slice. Perhaps next one I shall. 
 My dear Mother   &amp;  Sisters. 
 About 2 days ago received Alice's letter of April 10th from Talbot, which I was very pleased to get. So glad you   &amp;  Eddy had such a nice holiday   &amp;  trust the dear little chap has been able to go to school   &amp;  will be happy there. It is really the best for children to go   &amp;  compeat with others.
