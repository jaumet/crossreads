 Dear Bett Just a line to let you all know that I am well and at present am enjoying myself some.   Some Nurses came down to the train last night, and woke us up, they were jolly Girls.   We quite enjoyed talking to them.   This is a bonny country, green &amp; fresh after Egypt.   Snow in places, and a heavy frost this morning, Love to all from Chas.
