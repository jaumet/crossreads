 February 1916 the afternoon cleaning up for it.  All the detail sergeants were away at a dinner.  The guard turned out looking very clean.  We had a bit of trouble about 9 pm.  One man a patient of Lunar Park got the DTs but we got the inlying picket out &amp; the AMC took him away in  a car.  It took 5 men to hold him.  We had him on a stretcher &amp; got him back to the hospital in a car. 
 Sunday 20th  Had a fairly quiet day on guard.  Cousin Will did not turn up.  Sgt Long came out but  I  did not have much time to spare.  He wants me to come down to Alexandria to see him.  Promised me a good time. Was relieved off guard at 5 pm.  Wrote a letter to Kate &amp; went to the Soldiers Club for supper.
