JULY   SUNDAY 9   1916
Fine & warm. [Our/One?] destroyer still zig zagging about in front of us. We saw lots of whales in morning. Had a church parade in morning  We sighted land at 9.30 AM and there was great excitement at seeing "the promised land" at last. We steamed into Plymouth harbour and dropped anchor at 4.10 pm in the aftenoon. We found all the other ships in before us  The men from them disembarked in evening but we did not. Capt. Chicken distributed the prizes won in sports on board; and we presented him with an address, also the Chief Officer. It made one feel [an/all?]  [?], coming up the coast to think of all the history of the place and all the great men who sailed those waters & the deeds they did. And now in the World's greatest war, to see ships of all sizes & of all nations sailing about as usual  Could you have a greater tribute to Great Britain's sea power, I doubt it.
