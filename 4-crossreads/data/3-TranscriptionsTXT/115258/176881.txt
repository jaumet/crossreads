 find interresting in patches. I know a few of the places in it. It is still rather chilly up and we are rugging our horses at night, but I heard that it was 104 down at Ludd a couple of days ago - and according to report, that would be a cold day doen at Jericho - so this is a funny country alright - and you could drive rigth accross it in about three hours in a car - so its a quick change artist alright. I expect my next letter will be from some where down Wadi Kelt way, so I dont suppose I&#39;ll be talking about the cold much more. I had a couple of letters from Alan last mail and he and Hal seemed to be having a pretty hihg old time for a few days there but I suppose you take him down a peg or two in the holidays. Hal also has signed the pledge against letter writing as far as I&#39;m concerned it seems. I saw a good joke in an English paper the other day - there was a picture of two Tommies of the Bains father type and one says to the other &quot; Wot was you before the war, Bill?&quot; and Bill say &quot;Appy&quot;. Thats a true one I guess. I dont think there is any news to tell you so I&#39;ll knock off. Love to Father and Mother. I am Your loving brother Robert C Wilson 
 P.S. You might post me over four No. 1 Junior Kodak films (No 2 Brownie size) when you get this Fred. They are very hard to get over this side now, but I have three spools to carry on with and am not taking many more photos about here. Rob.
