Good news received daily re. the war by wireless & we are all expecting the unconditional surrender of Turkey daily. As a big move is being made now on the Palastine front 10's of thousands of Indian troops on the way over to give them the final knock out blow.
14.10.186 am we passed [blank] & [blank] & steamed out of the Persian Gulf into the Gulf of Oman. Still warm & very oppressive. Temperature 91 during the day & 90 at night. No wind, calm & the sea like glass. The troops drilled physicial & rife & machine gun drill each battalion has 16 Lewis machine guns. They are capable of firing 140 rounds a minute manned by 6 Indians & proved very effective.A robbery being committed on board during last night. One of our ships quartermasters lost 29 in notes from his room & a able seaman 8. No trace of the culprit. Inquiries fruitless having so many thousands on board. Another boiler lit & the speed increased to 12 1/2 knots on account of being 12 days steaming
