<p>Patrols going out in all directions scouting for signs of "Jacko" we are about 15 miles from El A Rich here and that 15 miles is important we have I believe to get there before this is over. What is before us. The nights are rather cold and it is quite a struggle getting out of bed. A message came through late last night to the effect that a strange Officer had been seen in the 8th Manchester lines asking questions and also in the 157th Brigade somewhere on the outpost line. He was asking questions about the disposition of troops &amp; guns etc when he had gone they suddenly bethought themselves that he may be a spy and sent a message around to all concerned to that effect, instead of detaining him on suspicion. Really there is no doubt about the thorough incompetence and block-headeded stupidity and general muddle-headed-ness of these "Tommy" Officers and men generally. The spies always make for the "Tommy" lines knowing that they can get all the information they want from that quarter. I notice that they are never reported noseing around the Australian lines at</p>
