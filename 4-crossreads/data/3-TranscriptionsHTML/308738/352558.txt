<p>Nov. 27 Saturday 1915<br/>In Bed all day.<br/>Concerts are given regularly here, but so far I cannot get along to them. Gramaphones are taken to different wards &amp; the patients can hear the latest songs free.<br/>Photo albums of Australia are also for the use of the Sick who love to look at old familiar spots again.</p>
