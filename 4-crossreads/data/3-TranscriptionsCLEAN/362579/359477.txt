I shall cable but do not write any more letters after this until yhou hear from me.
Ten of us have been told to be ready. We do not know what route but shall cable as soon as I reach Australia.
Have not received any letters from Ethel since she went to Talbot.
It was very bright   &  gay fro you all having Annie   &  Phyllis staying so long. You seem to have plenty of visitors   &  it is good for you.
Had nice letters from Chanty   &  Gers, Mollie. Alice Bower, Marion, Annie Thomas, Mrs Baynes   &  Allen.
