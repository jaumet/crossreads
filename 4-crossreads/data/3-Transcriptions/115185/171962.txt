<p>are 23 years old, sisters children &ndash; Charlie Dowe manages his Father's station 40 miles from Tamworth. The Father is 70 and has cancer of the jaw &ndash; and the son was much opposed to volunteering. He also had great difficulty being accepted &ndash; though very large and healthy about Gibson's stature &ndash; he has very weak eyes and could not get a commission but managed things for the Veterinary Corp. somehow or other. He's a real country man. Armidale school &ndash; simple and straightforward &ndash; but should think [indecipherable] the land &ndash; has 5 brothers all &ndash; but the younger at Armidale School &ndash; on their own &ndash; and between them 9!! sisters. All married but three. His father has two stations &ndash; and this lad has had full running of them &ndash; but I think they have good over-seers there &ndash; he is however very anxious as he expects to hear of his Father's death any day &ndash; and his Mother is very dependent on this son.
