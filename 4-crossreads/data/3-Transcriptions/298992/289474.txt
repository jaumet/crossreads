<p>surprise I got on receiving news of Hazel's marriage. Well, I never thought I would miss that event, and am more disappointed than you can imagine. Hazel says, "never mind, perhaps you will be home for a more important event" Means my own perhaps! What!! &ndash;</p>
<p>I had a screamingly funny letter from Wilga a few days ago, and I want you to keep it till I get back. &ndash; I wouldn't like to lose that one, it's a real beauty, and of course we cannot carry too much around with us. Don't let Wilga know you have it &ndash; she mightn't like me showing her letters about. Also one from Ron to you that I have meant to send ages ago, but forget each time. I came in one from Father about a month ago, and I don't follow why I should have received it?</p>
<p>Heaps of Love to all the family, &amp; I'll write again soon &amp; tell you "what's doin'.</p>
<p>Your son</p>
<p>Alan.</p>
