<p>4-7-16<br/>Tue 4th<br/>Reference was made on orders this morning to the coming boxing tournament &amp; seven men nominated today;<br/>A patrol of 6th &amp; 7th L.H. saw a patrol of Turks leaving Oghratina today when they were out on duty;  A strong rumor is current amongst the officers that Romani will be attacked by the Turks before long but none of the lads will listen to it, &amp; we all hope they do, as the country around here now is well fortified every sand hill is a "strong post" &amp; practically impregnable against infantry &amp; it is impossible to bring heavy guns across the desert, the railway line now runs well ahead of this camp &amp; we think we shall soon have to make a camp at Oghratina leaving the English troops here to protect Romani;<br/>Put tonight in at the Y.M.C.A. singing hymns &amp; James gave a short address</p>
