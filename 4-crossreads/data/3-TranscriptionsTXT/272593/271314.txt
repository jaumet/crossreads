chips, fried bread, bacon, & etc not bad you know, but the night before the rats pinched our meet & we done a skinner,  after breakfast, Starkey handed over his ammunition stores to the incoming Corporal, while I handed over the whole concern to the Sergt. & then set out to find the Battalion. On the way down I had to report to Div Hqrs & the officer in charge of Ammunition said he was very pleased at the way we carried out our duties, & he hoped the next lot would be somewhere the mark.There was a false gas alarm just as the Battalions were relieving & I believe it was dead funny the antics some of them were cutting.
