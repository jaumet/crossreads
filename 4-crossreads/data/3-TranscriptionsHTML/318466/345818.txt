<p>Sunday 18 August 1918<br/>A delightful morning at Tennis.  Was warned in afrn. for passage o/seas on Monday.  Packed &amp; went up for my orders.  This has come as a surprise rather.</p>
<p>Monday 19 August 1918<br/>Left Sutton Veny &amp; arrd. S'hampton with Rup for lunch.  Embarked at 7 p.m. and go back to the war once more after 3&frac12; mths. away.  Mehan &amp; young Hughes are on the boat.</p>
<p>Tuesday 20 August 1918<br/>Plenty of Yankees on our boat, landed Havre at 8 a.m.  Reported to A.I.B.D. and realised "that it's not to be reasoned down or lost in high ambition".</p>
<p>Wednesday 21 August 1918<br/>Up to Gas Chamber in morng.  Was warned later to "proceed" but it was cancelled so Mehan &amp; I went into Havre &amp; had a dip.  Dinner at the Club &amp; home early.</p>
<p>Thursday 22 August 1918<br/>Anor. stifling hot day &amp; spent chiefly in pyjamas!!  No word yet to move.  News of an offensive up Arras way.  No mail from Rup yet.</p>
<p>Friday 23 August 1918<br/>Much cooler &ndash; thank the Lord!!  Bridge all morng. &amp; won 5 francs.  No mail from England yet.  Also no word to move.  Albert captured.</p>
<p>Saturday 24 August 1918<br/>We get orders to leave for the Line so went into Havre &amp; bought a few things I may require.  Big crowd of officers in the A.I.B.D. now.</p>
