most crowded imaginable. Reinf arrived at 6.30 marched straight off and pushed through musketry course, all garrison duty and medically fit struck off and sent away. Mule drivers left for Alexandria by midday train and generally the number of details in and out enormous. General Legge addressed all officers N.C.O's and gave some interesting good advice. Stayed in camp all evening issuing orders and straightening out financial mess. Longed for a final run round the wickedest city in the world, Le Cairo, and all the old incense and perfume scented places that seem so exotic and Eastern. But suppose as we move off to Turkey tomorrow or next day that there will not be time for "Stippolak" or Getz or another glance round Cairo de Paris Abbaye or Kursayl. The men now (9.55) returning to Camp freighted with wine and quite happy. No buglers in camp only 100 men out of 1000 on parade this evening. They'll have no money from now on and will work like hell. Bed very tired.
