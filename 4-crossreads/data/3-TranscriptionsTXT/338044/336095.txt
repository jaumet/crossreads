sea. Just like glass. Could not imagine the ocean so smooth  Swarms of small flying fish, a few [indecipherable] etc. More bouts in boxing tournament.
Oct 24th.Very calm &  not so hot. Out early & expecting to see land shortly  Two islands were sighted on the starboard side about 2 pm. A good deal of speculation as to their names. Soon afterwards we sighted another steamer on the horizon, apparently a transport. Accompanying  it was a smaller vessel, thought to be a convoy. About 6 pm we sighted another large island &  passed very close to it, having a good view. Most interesting day since Albany.Oct 25
