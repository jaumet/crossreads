tons of interesting news, but when we come to write we've forgotten half of it. Had a good time in town tonight and got surprising news and when we returned to camp. Orders to pack up and be ready to move off early n the morning.
Saturday 8th
Poor old Sanitary Police "fall in" for more hard work, cleaning up the camp before we leave, Mac I got quite a decent sweat up. We left Morbeegue about 10. The townspeople gave us a good send off, and I'm sure they were sorry to see us go, as the 8th Brig. had spent a lot of money in the place. We passed through some very pretty country and a number of small villages. We had a spell for dinner at about 2 in a town, and here we had the sight of our lives, so far, are aeroplane duel, but unfortunately, both ?planes went out of sight, and we did not see the finish. We were all jolly glad when we reached Estaires, where we billeted for the night in a warehouse, in one of the main streets. It was a great relief to get our packs off, as they got mighty heavy, after travelling a few miles. After tea we had a wash, and took a stroll around the town which is of considerable size. We look through the cathedral, which is very ancient and contains some beautiful wood carving and very fine stained glass windows. There are some fine big shops here, and some of them did good business. We turned into bunk at about 9.30 and slept soundly till about 7 next morning. 
Sunday 9th
Left Estaires about it, just as the people were going to Church. It is hard to believe that we are so near the firing line. As people in these towns seem quite normal, they go to Church and drink beer just as though nothing of importance was on at all.
