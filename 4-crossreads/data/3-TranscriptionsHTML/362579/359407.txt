<p>Charlie nor Fred lately, do trust they are alright.</p>
<p>Sorry to say the cake has not arrived yet   &amp;  am just longing for some home made cake &ndash; the Cake here is awful. made with honey   &amp;  I can't eat it.</p>
<p>Hope you have been able to fix up about the house also that it will not mean more worry for you all. Everything is fearfully dear   &amp;  I seem it was a number of little things that cost money. Cannot save much, in fact, spending my extra 2/6 a day. Hoe it goes I cannot tell. Living at C.C.S.</p>
