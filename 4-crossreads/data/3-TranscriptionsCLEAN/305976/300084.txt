  
 Saturday Nov 16 Second day of sports Beautiful day. The inhabitants if Richon were at the sports today. We heard today that permission had been granted to build a Racecourse also, that we were to be photographed by official photographer. The Horses  are looking well & fit & have earned a rest now that the campaign has finished. We have no complaint to make here as the heads are doing all they can to make our time of waiting until embarking for home as pleasant as possible. We have plenty of sports, football, & one can get leave to visit the various Towns handy.
