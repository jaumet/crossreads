 AUGUST   TUESDAY 22   1916 
 Fine & warm. Out signalling all day with the class but we had no flag work as our arms were a bit sore. There was a big observation baloon up near us in the afternoon. Went for a walk with B de  Super after tea to Ficheldeen Ablington & Milford to Durrington & back to camp. It was about six miles round but about the prettiest one I have ever had. The trees & lanes are simply beautiful.
