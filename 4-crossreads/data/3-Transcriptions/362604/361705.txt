<p>Sarum to Southampton.  There are only 2 Hills just out of Salisbury &amp; the rest is dead level or downhill.  It was just glorious cycling through the cool shady Beech avenues.  Trees 60 feet high intertwining branches over head forming a complete arch sometimes a mile in length.  We had some fruit salads &amp; extras &amp; went to Tommy's Cousin's House for Tea &amp; arrived back at Salisbury at 10 p.m. &amp; cycled Home in the cool.  We travelled just about 45 miles by Bike.  On Romsey Station we belted some Strawberries &amp; Raspberries &amp; I saw Roy Tredrea's name written up on the Station wall.  He must have hopped out while the train was in the Station &amp; scribbled His name on the way through from Southampton.  Well, Mum, it is frightfully hot &amp; I'm going out on to the Oval for a bit of fresh air.</p>
