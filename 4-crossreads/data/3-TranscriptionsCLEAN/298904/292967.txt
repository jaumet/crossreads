  
 Horse had sapped out about 60 yards & had opened up a new firing line during the night, the next night they made a pretty determined bomb attack on them but they were beaten off easily we took a hand in this for we put a cross fire on to them, things were pretty hot for a while, the rifle & machine gun fire being especially severe the disturbance lasted about 30 mins. & they then threw it up, we got 19 of their dead in & about 17 wounded next morning one of our stretcher bearers done a risky thing there was a wounded Turk out in the open, & he hopped over the parapet & fetched him in, a plucky act
