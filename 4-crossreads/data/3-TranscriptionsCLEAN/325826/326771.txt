Did you ask me about the type-writer, anyhow I want to tell you.  Rid only used it a few weeks at the Hospital and now I have to hump it home again, cheerful isn't it?  Still it was one of the risks of war the bringing it over just on the chance of it being useful.  Yes it reached him in perfect condition thanks to your tirelessness in its packing, but on the train journey from Alex. when he left there, the box got smashed in a little & one little part of the machine, which, fortunately he says is not important, got broken off.  My deck chair is quite good & I haven't lost it yet.     If you decide Father that you can't leave the garden to come & meet me I shall sit down on the wharf and weep on arrival because I have got such a mob of things & there won't be my sweet friends the arabs by the million to grab them for me and hustle them into about seven gharis, oh it will have to be a removal cart or something though, I suppose as they don't have gharis there.     As far as I know now this is the mob.  My big leather trunk, a roll of rug & cushion, deck-chair, a suit case thing (bought here) and my small case, like your school one- cheerful isn't it?  And mostly old rubbish packed inside them too, for crowds of my things are falling to pieces and yet too good to throw away specially in war time.  Mother I have done yards & yards of stitching by hand here, putting fresh bands on, or new edging, or patching, letting out things that were new & have shrunk &c. &c. & I hate all my clothes.Well as you can plainly see I'm only talking but I can't help it I am so restless.  Let me tell you though, what an unusual day Saturday was at the soldiers' cafe.  I hardly ever see a soul I know but this day two or three soldiers I know looked me up and by the end of the day I had seen millions.  It was quite queer too the various ranks of these boys, let me tell you who they were.
