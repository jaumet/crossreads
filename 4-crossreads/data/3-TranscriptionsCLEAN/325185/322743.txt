  
 that is those that have had twelve months service. I doubt if I shall stay here for the month It is certainly all very nice & the spell here is just what one wants as your nerves get racked a bit after being under shell fire for awhile but I want to get back to my Batt. again as soon as I can. I havint been abel to find out how they fared after I left on the 18th Aug. The attack had just started when I was put out of action. I have been told they lost pretty heavily. That is only to be expected. I am anxious to hear how my sections fared. Have written to a couple of them but so far havint received any answer. I dare say I shall have to start all over again now. That is as a private again. But have no fear on that score I can get the stripes again
