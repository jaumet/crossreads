<p>Mother dearie,<br/>I just wanted to add something to the letter I posted home this morning and thought this time I would address it to you.  It is so good of you to write to me so often Mother dear, and I hope that you do not mind my not writing separate letters to you and Father, but seeing that you are "one" you are not likely to want more than one letter between you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to say that after all I sent you a cable this morning.  I tramped up &amp; down my room trying to decide what word to use &amp; after I had started off to the cable office once, came back again to think it over again, it was so difficult to know how to express what I meant in a few words.  I tried "hesitating," "undecided" &amp; all sorts; of course the "grateful" I meant for your welcome, though I hadn't doubted that for a minute.   I hope you understood the "considering," I think you would mostly.<br/>I meant to tell you in this morning's letter about a talk I had with an elderly gentleman here, but the time flew and in my hurried finishing I forgot it.  But I will take more time now &amp; just hope that this too will catch the same mail.<br/>Let me tell you first though what a shockingly disagreeable day this is.  Yesterday afternoon one of those characteristic desert winds- a something "phoon"- swept down on us, and the whole time since then the air has been thick with dust, we must be swallowing "tons" of it, it really is disagreeable work breathing.<br/>They say that sometimes it keeps up like this three, sometimes eight days, surely people's rooms must turn into gardens then!</p>
