Every inch of these wonderful rooms is either carved or painted. The wood work of the walls is chiselled into thousands of designs. Paintings by masters are in every room and on every ceilings. The old conductor spoke in terms of extreme unction as we went from one room to another. ?C?est la salle a manger d?la reine Marie Antoinette?. "C?est le cabinet de travail de l?Empresse Josephine, la premiere femme de Napoleon le premier". The Salle de la Guerre is a small room full of the glorification of war. The walls are carved into representations of golden armour and mighty warriors and the paintings showed victorious battles.
