Tommy's address; Cpl. R. Thompson. H.Q. A.I.F., Bhurtpore Barracks, Tidworth Hants. England. The one you gave me is an old one. He is near Olly & I want to see him this weekend. I have been made a full Sergeant again, one of the boys, a very nice chap too, but not a particularly brilliant soldier, having been reduced to Corporal. I had a letter from Fatty Penfold from France, very jovial as usual. In London I saw Goog Tyson who is now a Captain in the 3rd Btn. He is easily 6' 3" high and looks very well tho' wounded. His last of Cairns Niven & Noel was all O.K. I do hope so.
