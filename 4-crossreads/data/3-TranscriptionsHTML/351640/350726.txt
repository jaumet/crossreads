<p>he has looked out from such height upon the Libyan dessert and the fertile valley of Old Nile.  Something interesting to narrate in years that are to come.</p>
<p>Between 5 &amp; 6.30 pm. I was riding on the dessert and watched the sun set.  The golden ball dipped rapidly over the edge of the precepices away to the West, leaving in the heavens about various changing tinges of green, with thereafter a silver lining to the few clouds that floated in the air.  It may be that our departure from Mena being close at hand my opportunities for galloping across the dessert may not be many more.  One can see cultivated feilds in any part of the world, but there is but one Saraha &amp; its barren Eastern extremity is named Libyian.</p>
<p>The letters by the Orsova should be here tomorrow, today the ship was timed to leave Port Said, and the mails for Cairo would be landed at Suez and thence dispatched by train.  Any how shall I hope.  The newspapers have not come to hand.  If you did not put upon each double postage it may be that they are still in Sydney.  That will be somewhat of a swindle especially for me.</p>
<p>A copy of The Times, dated London 31ST March was handed to me today.  I do not know who was good enough to send it.  There was much of interest about the strikes, the shortage of war supplies, and the war.</p>
<p>12-4-13. Hurrah!  Hurrah!!!  Hurrah!!!!!  8 p.m. Letters from each of you were given to me at 6 p.m., they were brought from Cairo by motor car.  I expected them as the Orsova was timed to pass along the Suez canal yesterday or the day before.  These came from Maggie, Doffie, Mr. Watkins.</p>
<p>Car dear:  All writing about you agree that the change to Blackheath has given you just the correct tonic to bring you into perfect health.  Good.  It is <strike>good</strike> well that</p>
