<p>19/8/18<br/>Vecquemont<br/>down to the General. Talked about the recent stunt which is a mess up for him to open up with and shows lack of thought. Dined afterwards with him and the Staff and came back to my dugout  for a round or two of paper warfare and eventually I hope, a bath.</p>
<p>20/8/18<br/>Another hot and busy day. Camped in dugouts &amp; bivvies facing the wooded valley of the River Somme. Band played for a while and all the Coys went for a swim to the river after lunch. Extremely warm and unpleasant in the mess and there were also plenty of flies.</p>
