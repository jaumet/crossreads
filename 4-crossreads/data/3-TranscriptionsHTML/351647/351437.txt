<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>Things have been in such a dizzy whirl lately that I've lost count of <strike>how</strike> when I wrote last &amp; what I told you.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that we went to Aerodrome Camp (near Heliopolis) when we first arrived.  We only had a few days there &amp; then moved to Toma near Maadi on the other side of Cairo.  I was one of the advance party which went to get the camp ready.  We left Christmas Eve &amp; had a weary trip &amp; it rained too.  We arrived at Toma late &amp; tired &amp; just turned in as we were.</p>
<p>Christmas Day we spent erecting tents &amp;c. &amp; our dinner consisted of dry biscuit, bully beef &amp; tea.  I thought of you all &amp; wished myself with you.  We got off at 3.30 p.m. &amp; I went in to Cairo, met my brother &amp; had dinner &amp; a long yarn.</p>
