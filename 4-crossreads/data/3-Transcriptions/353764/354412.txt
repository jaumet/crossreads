<p>known to the men on this mornings early parade &amp; great was the astonishment when it was given out, as it was the last thing expected &amp; in many cases friends of long standing were parted.  I managed to keep Cousins, Hayne &amp; a few more of my own friends.<br/>The rest of the Company, that is the 14th have to shift out as soon as the Alexandria crowd leave.  This is a further injustice, as we have now got our Camp looking A.1. &amp; I suppose when we arrive at Helmieh we will find it filthy.<br/>I received 2 letters to-day, 1 from Mum &amp; Edna &amp; 1 from Nina, but am afraid that it will be some time before I am able to write.</p>
<p>26.2.16 Saturday<br/>Everything here is in a bustle preparatory to half our fellows moving out to Alexandria.<br/>We played the 7th Coy Cricket &amp; had another win.<br/>At last my certificate has been sent along to qualify me for a Commission &amp; I am anxiously awaiting further developments.<br/>I anticipate a very pained feeling to-morrow as our Company is to part.  Hard luck but duty is duty</p>
