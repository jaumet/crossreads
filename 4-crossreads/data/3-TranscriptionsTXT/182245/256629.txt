 1917 APRIL 
 24 TUESDAY 
 A perfect day. Cleaning 
 harness ect all afternoon 
 &amp; took our horses out 
 for exercise &amp; grazing 
 in morning. Some of the 
 sergeants rode into 
 Bolougne, but lower ranks 
 are not allowed to go. 
 I got letters from Linda 
 father &amp; M rs &nbsp;Allison but 
 none from mother.
