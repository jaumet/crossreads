<p>Mann went away as a staff trainee - this is quite a change, fancy, have a nice room big double bed &amp; sheets to sleep in - the spell will do me good - I have had a good run now &amp; wouldnt have liked to break up, which has happened to a lot of fellows. I havnt heard any more about my application for the Indian army. Of course it will take a lot of time - will send in another in a month or so.<br/>How is Dad getting on give him my very best love &amp; tell him the news, no doubt you keep him posted about me - I would have sent my cross over only it may be lost it is in safe keeping in the Bank in London. I suppose you have read how we have been tuning the Hun up here lately, the australians have never in their career done better - everyone in France is talking about them - the old 1st Divisions daylight raids paralysed them - by gum the felt hat is popular here</p>
