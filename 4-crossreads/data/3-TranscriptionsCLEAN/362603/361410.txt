  
 6.  It was only an Hour to go then so I was not weary at all. This morning between 8 am & 9 am we had Hail, rain, snow & sunshine.  What do you think of that?  It has been fine all the afternoon but a nice sharp March wind has been blowing.  Now, Mum & Dad & George, it is after lights out & I am pretty tired so I will ring off.  Ellis is nice & snug in bed but mine is not made yet.  I've had supper & the fire is not yet out but I still like to be beneath the blankets early. Give Best Wishes to all the Neighbours & to Mrs Keirle too.  Reg. was over again to-day.  He only stays about 30 minutes & He's off again.  I met a Manly Boy named May in the Strand on Sunday.  Lieut. May who was killed from Manly was His Brother or Cousin I'm not sure which. Regards also to Mr & Mrs Ali & the Dobsons & Buntings. Best Love from Harry & Ellis
