<p>a ship ahead of us was torpedoed by the Boches, so we were in a constant state of readiness for a dip in the Deep Blue.</p>
<p>We arrived at Maiseilles on Friday 31st. I was inoculated twice on board against Para typhoid &ndash; 9 times in all I have had the needle in me since I enlisted on the 19th April last year. Add vaccination to this &amp; I think I should be germ proof.</p>
<p>As I was saying good-bye to General Forsyth on board the troop ship, the Marquis de Beauvoir &ndash; a Bourbon &amp; descendant of one of the oldest French noble families, introduced himself to us. He was very excited &amp; enthusiastic about the Australians. He made a speech to the boys from the Wharf &amp; they cheered him heartily. Incidentally he was very good to us. He took me to the Grand Hotel in his car &amp; then sent the car back to the ship for my batman &amp; luggage. He was kindness itself.</p>
<p>I stayed in Maiseilles until Sunday when I left for Paris. The trip was interesting</p>
