<p>Thursday 26 July 1917.</p>
<p>6 o&#39;clock reveille again this morning. A little fatigue work preparing to move out of camp. Light Horse moved out to Details Camp at Moascar.</p>
<p>Wrote to D&#39;nong (Sigd. green O.A.S. envelope with snap of Doris (Imperial) enclosed and posted same at Post Office in Moascar Camp.)</p>
<p>Found later that such snaps are not permissable, that was the reason why I added the bracketed note above to protect myself should anything arise about it later.</p>
