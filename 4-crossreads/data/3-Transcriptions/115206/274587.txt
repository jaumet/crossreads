<p>January 1918<br/>Thursday 17</p>
<p>At Beutin<br/>I am feeling rather blue today for I have been thinking about home; however we must not allow such beautiful thoughts to hinder our minds and spirits.<br/>Went in company with the tall James, to the cinema, and enjoyed the programme &ndash; fully. Five large and long pictures.<br/>Old Dick looks pretty fit.<br/>Weather fine and warmer than usual.</p>
