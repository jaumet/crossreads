 Ashdod again , and the same night 12.11.17 start for the beach , when it was rumour we were to have a few day spell , for purpos of re-organis . A coupl of hour brought us there , and after feed up almost the first thing I did was to have a plung in the brini . It is imposs for one who has never been through the experi to imagin the feel of deep and utter satisfact that take hold of one , when you have been travel three or four day without even a wash , to be put down in a place where there is plenti of water . You feel you could live in it , roll in it , revel in it in an excess of happi And the clean that is done Cloth are wash , bath are the order of the day , week , and fortnight old beard are shave , and everyon is clean and happi onc more . I never knew befor that water could be so precious . I shall alway look on it with differ feel after these experi . The rumour of a few day spent here , though , prove like most other Armi rumour , or "furfi " as they are call to be " a lie jade " and the next day we were on the move again . This time we did not stop at Eshdud , but went pass it and around it ,
