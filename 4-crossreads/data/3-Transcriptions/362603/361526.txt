<p>Y.M.C.A. with the Australian Imperial Force letterhead.<br/>Bulford<br/>23.9.17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>I have your letter of the 16.7.17.  I guess that there was a shindy at Cohen's with the whole crowd of them.  It will fine if You can get a sulky in exchange for the old Bike &pound;15 spent on that Bike &amp; she'll be as good as new.  I have not written since last Friday.  I have so many letters to write that the time slips away &amp; I miss the chance.  I don't write every Sunday because sometimes I have no idea what to write about at all.<br/>Last Saturday night I was pinched riding without a Tail light.   It went out through jolting down a long Hill.  I've heard nothing further yet, so it was probably only a caution.  Last Tuesday &amp; Wednesday it rained all the Time.  They were very miserable days but we are liable to the same even in "sunny" N.S.W.</p>
