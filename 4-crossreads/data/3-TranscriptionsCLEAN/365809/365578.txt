kicking myself that I took five of the curs prisoners and gave them their lives. Curs they were with no fight in them and I hadn't been aroused like I am now.
Fritz will cop it very solid when our boys meet him again as it will a long time before we forget our beloved 'Bill' Bennett - the officer I spoke of.
I came through without a scratch and am feeling very fit and well. The weather once more is rotten, wet and cold. Give my respects to Keith and my kind regards to Mrs. Ferguson and Dorothy.
