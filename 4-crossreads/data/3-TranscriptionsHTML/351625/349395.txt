<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>I am writing this to catch the mail in Fremantle where we expect to arrive in a couple of days time.  I expect this letter will reach Sydney about 3 days before we do.  So far we have had a pretty good voyage but rather tiring not having been off the boat since leaving England except for a swim.  A few days ago I got a slight feverish attack &amp; was sent into hospital where I am still residing although my temperature was back to normal the day after I came in but I intend stay as long as they keep me as we get chicken, jellies, custard, fruit galore, just a little breaking in for whats in store Ah!  I am wondering if you have received any of my previous letters from England saying I was coming</p>
