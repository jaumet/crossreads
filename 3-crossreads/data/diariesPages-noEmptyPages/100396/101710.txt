in the first engagement. our non coms, or non officers, don't seem to have much knowledge of the matter except what is printed in the drill book.
Rumours still come to hand as to the date of our departure but I place no trust in any of them they generally come by cook house wireless or from other places. I had a note from Lois Parton yesterday asking me to go and see them if possible of course I'll go. They live out Toorak way not far from the city. Our Lieut has just come back from Sydney where he has been on holiday. The Captn. in charge of our lot was with him during the 3 days he was away nothing much was done sgts nearly all drunk men taking leave each night one Colour Sgt only came home today. he will of course get into a row about it. We have a roll call about half past nine each night, have to make all sorts of excuses for those who are missing however they, the missing are most ready for parade next morning.
In other Cos they only have roll calls now again A Co of artillery must about 50 short out of 60 after roll call the other night. I don't know whether all these men were fined for breaking camp. I expect they its not a game I take on myself. I don't like chasing myself about the city at night over much. I suppose its because I don't like beer,
