<p>Company moving to-morrow.  Fraser went out at 10.30 so I missed him and saw him in evening.</p>
<p>28.2.18<br/>Got up about 8 and at 10 went out with company on motor lorries and followed Fraser to Spoilbank.  Some shelling just above us.  Came back with 13th Company and landed at 1.30.  Had dinner and in evening went to Steenwerck and saw pictures and purchased bread.  13th not much of a crowd.  Home at 8 after seeing Bill on way out.  Cloudy.</p>
<p>1.3.18<br/>Was called by guard at 5.30 and met leave train in Bailleul at 7.20.  No captain.  Home again and back to Bailleul at 12 with the others and met leave trains at 1 after buying lunch.  Met train at 5 and Sinclair &amp; Major came.  He went to Rest Camp and we went home.  Sinclair a bit silly which certainly was not our fault.  Also Sidman &amp; Burkitt back so arranged to meet at 9 next morning.  In aftn. Edmonds &amp; I went down to R.F.C. [Royal Flying Corps] and saw some of the boxing.  Walked home, tired and to bed.  Have to meet Sinclair at 9.30.</p>
<p>2.3.18<br/>Met Sinclair at 9.30 &amp; he made me accompany him to Kemmel, by motor lorry to Dranoutre [also spelt Dranouter] and walked rest.  Rotten arrangement he said but he made it.  Back at 12 with limber to Bailleul and he went to station to pick up the gear.</p>
