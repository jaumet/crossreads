 DARDANELLES, 2nd November 1915. 
 My dear Mother, 
 A letter came to hand from Ruby this mail, but so far have received no other.  However, there is more to be delivered yet, so May have some luck later. 
 Very pleased to hear that the Scarves arrived O.K. and note Ruby's flattering remarks on my taste etc.  I was very doubtful if you would receive them, as I had a bit of difficulty in getting them away. 
 I had a visitor yesterday in the person of Tom Price of Homebush.  He has been camped within 50 yards of us for the past eight weeks, and I have only just found him out.  Naturally we found a fair amount to talk about.  It was a great change to be able to talk over "home town" affairs with someone who knew practically everyone I did.  After reckoning up we came to the conclusion that there were no more eligibles (that we knew of) who had not joined up, which is not too bad for our slow old place. 
 An enterprising individual with a brain called at our Dug Out the other night with a couple of cakes to sell which we of course bought.  He had got the necessary commodities from goodness knows where and made them himself.  We had to pay 2/6 for cakes the corresponding size of which you would buy for 3d or 6d at home.  They were as heavy as lead and practically indigestible, but &ndash; oh! what a change.  We also bought some penny sticks of chocolate for 6d each.  Think I will chuck my rifle away and take on dealing.  It must pay better. 
 No signs of any more parcels yet.  Expect they will all come in a bunch. 
 Run out of news and paper for the present, so will knock off. 
 Hope everybody is well. 
 Love to all From your loving Son, Roy.
