have been a nicer one.
14th Mrs Newmarch gave us an afternoon tea at the recreation room to-day.  Twas very nice.  The Welsh band was there, so what could one wish more - I loved their rendering of the Rosary.
15th  Miss McConachy called to take me for a motor drive to visit the Flying Corps & the Remount Unit, after the first visit we had 3 punctures so had to come back in a gharry.
16th  I have enjoyed many donkey rides but last night's was absolutely perfect.  9 of us went including Matron out on the lovely road to Matarich.  The moon was up & the donks good & we just jogged on or cantered as the mood took us.  Such a night for dreaming and reminiscing.
18th I went over to Service this a.m. & Major Makeham preached from the text "God loveth a cheerful giver"  A beautiful sermon really.  The rifle brigade "A band of great old warriors who live in the barracks at the back of our place march in every Sunday morning & 3 parts fill the church.  In the afternoon another Sister & I had afternoon tea at Shepheards with two E- Officers - then took a tram to Heliopolis - walked around a bit admiring the fine buildings there & finished up by calling at the Luna Park, having a ride on the Scenic railway & down the water shoot etc.  Its converted into a pretty & attractive Gaiety Show.
