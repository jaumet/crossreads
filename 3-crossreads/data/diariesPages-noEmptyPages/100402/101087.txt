Wednesday 12 June
Fine weather continues. Fritz remains fairly quiet though our people continually throw stuff over to his side. Only occasionally does he send much back. In the air, our ?planes are much more in evidence than his our observing ?planes are always patrolling the front. To-night this Battn., the 7th is advancing about three hundred yards. Not many casualties expected.

This morning the 7th Battn. went over took their objectives, three strong points killing about fifty Bosches capturing another fifty. Our wounded numbered about thirty we had about twenty Germans. Everything was wonderfully quiet until the last man had been got away then Fritz opened up round our place with a big bombardment for about forty minutes. However, no damage. Relieved to-night now at La Kreule, I with the "dog's disease".
