<p>III<br/>Mrs Rabett senr and her daughter have just left for the old Country by Mrs Rex is still here. There is no get away, the little Major is the "real McKay". A thorough good sort in every way.<br/>The death of Gerald's wife must have been a great shock to Uncle &amp; Aunt. I should write to them but it is rather late in the day now and perhaps it would be better left undone.<br/>A little picnic up the River as per arrangement you describe would give me untold pleasure. I would wish for nothing better, but those things will have to keep I am afraid, for a little while.<br/>Wrote Mr Trebeck a line last week which I hope turns up in good time.<br/>Now for any news &ndash; during the week I had a half day off and took a trip with Ted Olding over to Heliopolis (City of the Sun). It is only about 20 minutes from Cairo, but I had never been able to get over before</p>
