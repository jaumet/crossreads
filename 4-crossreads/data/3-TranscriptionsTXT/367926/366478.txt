 Well Aunty, I am very sorry for not sending you some Xmas cards, we were up to our necks in work, &amp; then I went into hospital, through an accident, it was not much, I expect it came through in records, you will  be worried for a while. I am alright now, I never told you how it happened, we were playing cricket when the ball rose off the ground &amp; hit me seriously enough to put me in hospital for three months, I am back with my unit now going as strong as ever, &amp; looking forward to that Australian leave that I do not think we will get until 'Apres le guerre' then it will be compulsory to send us back.  We had polling day here for the referendum I do not think that conscription ought to be carrried because we want men like the present  generation of Australians to be in our own country  [indecipherable]  all is over if they send them over here they must either get killed wounded or get some action that will be with them all their life also the difference to the war would be nil practilly, you might be surprised at me for saying this but I can see a little more than the people at home Well Aunt, I will finish here hoping you are in the best of health &amp; spirits with lots of love &amp; best wishes for a brighter New Year from your loving Nephew Doddin 
 P.S. will you send me some more Eucalyptus stock has run out Dod
