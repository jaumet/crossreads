 September 1916 some new ones &amp; about 15 &percnt; of the old ones have had to go away.  Things are very quiet about here now.  Aeroplanes come over occasionally &amp; drop some bombs  A few scattered parties of Turks &amp; Bedouins have been captured &amp; brought in.  We have now had nearly a month's spell, only an occasional patrol or camel escort to do.  Still we manage to do a bit, exercising &amp; looking after horses etc.  It is very slow &amp; monotonous &amp; I wont be sorry even when we get out at Bir-el-Abd, 50 or more miles E of the canal &amp; do the outpost &amp; patrol work again.  A big wet canteen has been opened close to the camp so everybody is feeling satisfied.  We received the Anzac books we paid for some time ago  I sent one home. 
 Sept 7th As leave is still being granted &amp; many of the men had gone twice I put in again &amp; got 3 days &amp; left by the train at 10.30 am from Mahemadia getting to Port Said shortly after 1 oclock
