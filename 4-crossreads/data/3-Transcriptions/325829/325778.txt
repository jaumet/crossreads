Unfortunately they got the range of "C" Sqdn's led horses in the Gully killing &amp; wounding some 20 of them one man being blown to pieces &amp; a Cpl &amp; several men wounded. Trooper Gofton the medical Orderly displayed great gallantry attending to the wounded under shellfire, though himself being temporarily knocked out by concussion. L/Cpl Mcindoe also specially distinguished himself, lying on his back under intense machine gun fire, &amp; continuing to send &amp; receive message from Hdqrs with the ground literally ploughed up with bullets all round him. Considering the intensity of the fire our casualties were very light 2 officers being wounded two men killed &amp; 6 wounded. In both Sqdns the losses of the horses were severe 30 either being killed or badly wounded. The 2 Sqdns could do nothing but hang on doggedly until they were relieved at dusk by the Infantry. Rations &amp; forage were issued, &amp; fortunately we were able to supplement the latter by the excellent grazing from the green crops growing everywhere. [Indecipherable] Division decided an attempt should be made to blow up the railway line some place N of Amman whenever it was possible to force a way in.</p>
