  
 D-the fleas and D---the flies D---the heads with all their lies D-the place and D-the weather D---Gallipoli altogether D---the army and D-the track Damn it all Im going back 
 There is a happy land far far away Where you can oysters get at any old time of day Here were other fish to fry Learning how to do or die Blowing Turks up to the sky In the good old fashioned way 
 There is a happy land far far away Where you get up at ten Or sleep in all the day Here we get up at four To give the Turks a little more Of what they got the day before In just the same old way 
 There is a happy land far far away Where you can get a feed At any time of day
