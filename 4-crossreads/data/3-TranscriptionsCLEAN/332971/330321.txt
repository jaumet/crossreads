I was very interested in it all and its wonderful the amount of work the ladies do there, and everything I voluntary.  There are 1000 Workers names on the book & 300 work there regularly every day.  All kinds of comforts are made for the wounded Soldier and splints, slippers, bandages & dressings beautifully done and this place is only one of many in the United Kingdom.

Outside there is a large placard with 'Voluntary helpers urgently needed on it'.  And inside notices of rules everywhere (Typically English I think).  The first one you see as you open the doors is 'No dogs admitted' in large red letters, and underneath it.  'Please wipe your feet upon the mat' its all just so, Mary & I pay 1/2 to hang our coat on a hook, in the door a cap & apron & proceed to the top story we then don a cap & apron & proceed to the top story to the Moss room where two elderly ladies pick moss.  Mrs Theodore Bent & Mr Marshall.  We were soon iniated into the Art.  I thoroughly enjoyed it for the ladies were funny in their ways and as snappy as could be to each other, and never ceased running down Mrs Mac Tuck (A name that suited her they say) .  The person in charge of the two rooms, This one where they pick & the next where   the moss   is made up into pads.
