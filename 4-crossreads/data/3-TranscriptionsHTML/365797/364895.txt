<p>I suppose there are plenty of newspapers about? I assume they will have a free sale among the soldiers, so I dont send any except purely local news. I am posting a little packet of scraps to-day which I hope will reach you.</p>
<p>I do hope you got the "Syd mails" with Dorothys cover, you could blow a bit among the boys. Do you see any Bulletins there? It occurred to me that some newspapers would establish special Agencies, in view of the very large number of Australians in Egypt.</p>
<p>I need hardly mention the rage that shook us when the news of the "Lusitania" came through. Germany may delay the Day a bit, but she'll get it in the end all right, right in the solar plexus.</p>
<p>Have written this in a great rush to get off to-day, so you will understand if it is incoherent, but wit best love &amp; hopes of your success remain, dear Alan,</p>
<p>Your Father.</p>
