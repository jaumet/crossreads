(about 1  hours ride) it was a good pleasure trip : camps bay was very pretty : I notice plenty of Aust?n gum trees about they're used in many cases as border trees in the streets : had a stroll through the gardens : home about midnight
Tuesday June 3rd Capetown
Off to shore about 10 am : met Wal Muir had some time with him : had a swim in the morn but it was a bit too cold to be enjoyable : went through the Museum : out to Rhode's estate monument in afternoon : pleasant outing the monument is well worth a visit : it cost pound 80,000
