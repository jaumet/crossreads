<p>19/5/15  Punch<br/><u>From home to the Trenches</u></p>
<p>Sonny, it seems like twenty year,<br/>The while since you've been gone,<br/>And left me lonesome for you here<br/>Trying to do my bit &ndash; oh ,dear! &ndash;<br/>By keeping steady on.</p>
<p>I promised and I've meant to do,<br/>But now and then at night<br/>I've been to blame the time it blew<br/>Like guns that answered guns, with you &ndash;<br/>My you &ndash; amongst the fight.</p>
<p>But in the morning "Dear old fool"<br/>I've seemed to hear you say;<br/>"Mother, no need to fuss, keep cool,"<br/>Just like the Cheeky brat at school<br/>You was the other day.</p>
<p>You wasn't always quite so grand;<br/>Once you was mighty glad,<br/>Chased by a puppy-<br/>dog, to stand<br/>Behind your mummy, slip your hand<br/>In hers, the way you had.</p>
<p>Small son turned big, now that you're grown<br/>And in a real war,<br/>And set to face it all alone,<br/>I'm wild to run &amp; guard my own<br/>Same as I did before.</p>
