<p>27.3.16<br/>is to be made of it on the telephone  We arrived back in camp about 1.30 PM feeling very fit for dinner;  The interpreter told me today that all the Mahommedans in Egypt are hoping for a Turkish victory as the Sultan of Turkey's grandfather was a great Mahommedan prophet &amp; is worshipped by the Egyptian Mahommedans, &amp; all the Coptic Christians of whom there are a great many in Upper Egypt want English rule, &amp; the small village where Reid &amp; I have had a few rather amusing afternoons drinking tea &amp; smoking with them, are Mahommedans, &amp; Mahommed Bey Massy whom we met there is a relative of a Senussi General &amp; a very cunning man<br/>Mahommed Bey Massy in my opinion has the looks of a fine leader, &amp; is probably heart &amp; soul with the Senussis himself;<br/>C &amp; D Troop went out this evening</p>
