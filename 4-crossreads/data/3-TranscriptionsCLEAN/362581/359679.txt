 Got your lovely letters this week   &  think you are getting on wonderfully. Ella wrote to me also   &  told me you were very happy at School. Hope you will continue to like it   &  be strong enough o to on. What a lovely time you had at Grandma's birthday. Fondest love   &  kisses.  From  Auntie Eadle.
