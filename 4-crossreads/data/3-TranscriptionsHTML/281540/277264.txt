<p>13/11/15<br/>and together we watched a tiny speck shining brightly in the waves between hospital ship and a buoy and moving slowly  We decided it must be a partially submerged petrol tin with just the corner showing  It now turns out it was a submarine periscope as one was sighted on that day. Mackay round at 2000 after rum.  It is remarkable how many have got into habit of taking a night cap of this strong spirit &ndash; a habit I've not contracted though always on for a taste if there is a chance of good rum &amp; milk. To bed 2015 bright beautiful moonlight, a lovely scene.  An occasional big bomb bursting in a blinding flash and some shells from one of our new heavy guns on the North Shore tearing very hard overhead.  Marvellous moon light in this part of world.</p>
<p>14/11/15<br/>Up at stand to  Abdul busy and bustling as usual.  Mail in not many letters.  Mine fired at Lone Pine at 1100, not much concussion  Heavy rumbling of big guns down to the south.  Today Sunday busy rigging up standard for a flying fox down the gully.<br/>Tunnel through from dressing station started, entrance well boarded up.  Aeroplane up flying low and a good deal of shrapnel round it.  Cruiser standing well out.  Only the Suvla hospital ship in sight and all quiet on sea.  A dull day with grey skies.  Mail coming in during day and a parcel &amp; some mittens from Jakey also arrived, and some snaps.  Busy with clerical work after lunch Recd first of the London papers from WND. Met Curnow at 1530 and went to Gun Lane Field Artillery officer explained all about 18 pounders there and found it interesting.  Gun pit a fair distance ahead but gun a neutral one.  Sergt had better knowledge and gun was dirty, so critical does soldiering make us</p>
