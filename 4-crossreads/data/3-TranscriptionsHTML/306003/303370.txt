<p>29-5-16<br/>rumor goes;  &amp; we have been kept pretty busy this afternoon drawing iron rations etc;  as B Sqd Signallers are very weak through Jimmy Leask being away at the School of Instruction it has been decided that Les is to take charge of B Sqd Sigs &amp; Ally Hargreave is to come with me in his place.</p>
<p>30-5-16<br/>Tue 30th<br/>We left last night at 11 oclock &amp; made very slow progress until daylight going about half a mile or so &amp; then halt to see if everything was clear ahead;  The night was very dark as there was no moon;  Caught up with the New Zealanders early this morning they left shortly before us last night &amp; the Camel Transport &amp; Field Ambul. came away with us;  We arrived at Oghratina at 9 oclock this morning</p>
