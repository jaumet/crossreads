<p>20/2/16<br/>Stood to arms before dawn until after sun well up. Church parade at 0930, put in the pegs for ceremonial parade at 1230. The camp spotlessly clean and tent flaps up, kits dressed. Lunch 1100. Fell in for inspection by G.O.C. at 1210. Big parade and the men looked well and we gave general salute as the Staff rode up. Formed square and the G.O.C. spoke on discipline.</p>
<p>After dismissal the sports commenced with a good fight between Telfer and Anderson &ndash; the latter being knocked out after a few bloody rounds. Unearthed a very good runner in Smythe of "D" Co, who won the Hogs Back Gift, Wilderness Cup and Canal Zone Flutter. Montgomery won the old stagers burst and Fleming was successful in the cockfighting. A good afternoons sport. Paid out about 4800 piastres tariff during the evening &ndash; a good Sunday. Cloudy and cold in the morning, windy and a few drops of rain in the evening.</p>
<p>Saw a small snake (viper or asp) sandy coloured but light brown markings killed among the tents and also others out in the open. Also noticed a small lizard which was nearly transparent, - a very fragile looking little thing. Jimmy Alderson did good work on the sports and deserves much credit for the good he did. R.S.M Porter a great battler, with a voice like a roaring bull. Shakes up all the duties Peart not back yet but expected Monday. All niggers who get out this far selling papers are put under arrest and sent back. No. 6 platoon won the rifle exercises, lovely work full of quips &amp; swank. No. 2 second. Stand easy Dismiss (long pause).</p>
