 A few lines on the way as we are on the move back.  I've a letter half written somewhere but I'm blowed if I could find it.  Well Sunday slipped on to me and I didn't get my usual letter off, but this will keep you from swearing. 
 I had a letter from Auntie Maggie & one from Aunty May in  [indecipherable] and from the latter it appears Aunt Maggie has been laid up with the flue.  By the bye, I sent off my photos to you and hope you get them safetly. 
 Don't forget what I have written on another page & lay hold of that fiver.  I see too that another [indecipherable] has come to hand for which I am very pleased.  I am well up to "sugar" now and holding a fair bit on this side.  I will write further on this matter as soon as we get settled.  
 I'm quite OK, the fiddle is good Oh & we are having it a bit easier now.  But we've had a rough spin as far as work has gone. 
 Fondest love  
 Your loving son 
 James
