 Fine again. We had a look through the Gallery of War Pictures in The Jardin des Tuileries - well worth seeing.  Visited The Invalides where we saw German implements of war  e  captured at the Marne & Somme.  Zeppelin L49 which was brought down recently - German Fokker & other types of aeroplanes.  Guynemer's Plane is also on show.  He was killed recently - France's greatest airman.  The plane is decorated with flowers.  Saw Hotel de Ville - the leading Banks - The Matin Printing Office - Madeleine (Church) - Notre Dame (Church), Arc de Triomphe (2), many different Theatre Buildings & practically all the monuments.  The Tube railways are good & run on a splendid system.  Busses & Trams likewise, but the Taxis are not up to London standard. Saw Napoleon's Tomb at The Invalides
