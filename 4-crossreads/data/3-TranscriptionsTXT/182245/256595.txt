 1917 MARCH 
 21 WEDNESDAY 
 Fine, but cold &amp; dull till 
 the evening when it cleared 
 up. Went for a bath in the 
 morning &amp; as they did not 
 open till 10 AM we were 
 not back for stables. Out 
 exercising all the afternoon 
 Campbell went up to the 
 battery &amp; Wall came down 
 to take charge of the waggon 
 lines. Sent a post card 
 to Linda of Armenti&egrave;res, &amp; 
 half past eleven square 
 before the war.
