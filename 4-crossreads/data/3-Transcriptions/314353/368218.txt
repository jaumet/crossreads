<p>October 26<br/>As it stands, when bombing stunts are on, we must remain in darkness, completely unable to receive wounded or do dressings till the skies are clear.</p>
<p>All from the damned selfishness and entire lack of keenness of the Q.M. Capt. of the 2nd Field, and the Medical men in a desire for a larger dugout.</p>
<p>87.<br/>Nearing midnight&hellip; the night's been hard and clear:  a three quarters moon, and hard point stars are superb in a night of deep blue, of light horizons&hellip; and on the left flank, terrible bombarding has rolled on since early evening.  Only rumour tells us here of the morning's stunt&hellip;  It was the Canadian affair, - some few reports couple the English, or the London Scottish or ourselves with their names, and all objectives were taken with very few casualties.</p>
<p>Now clouds are slowly coming over&hellip; oh most desirable of sky decoratings.</p>
<p>3 a.m.  October 27<br/>First point to us, cases in, one a compound fractured leg&hellip;  we brought him into the dressing tent, put on an improvised tourniquet &ndash; and Rube went down to [indecipherable].</p>
<p>The Boche planes were up.. so all light must be put out, the dressing had to be done by the light of his torch, and it took some time.</p>
<p>The only damned point where he scored, was that no bombs were locally dropped till he'd got back to his dugout.</p>
<p>Shelling hereabouts wildly &ndash; seemingly wildly anyhow!</p>
<p>88.<br/>I have been reading Shaw's "The Sanity of Art"&hellip; at the 42nd page the brilliance begins to tire, and the last of the pages have been read to wandering thoughts.</p>
<p>Still the guns on the left keep their monotonous harmony, entirely without cessation, every few minutes rising heavily, to fall back again tiredly as before.</p>
<p>One of the wounded lads left a packet of photograph cards of great breasted heavy, sleekly beautiful animals&hellip;..  They led to a yarning of the nude in art.  Jane:  if only Basil Mac were here, in Rube's place.  Rube has elementary ideas certainly, but Mac &ndash; mid yarn the shells, the cold, and the long hours away, and we'd know of no troubles, till the next cases come &ndash; or came in&hellip;.</p>
<p>Shaw's "dud":  I'll read Brooke.  He's of more inspiration that even Keats, in the line or by it.</p>
