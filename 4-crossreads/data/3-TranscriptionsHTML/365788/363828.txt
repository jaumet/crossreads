<p>My dearest Irene,<br/>The &pound;3- from the Anglo Egyptian Bank has just arrived. Thank you very much dear old Girl. You will no doubt have had some very startling Cables in the Papers on the Dardanelles sitn before you got this. I cant give details, as Censor would not pass it.<br/>Had lunch with Harry Budden yesterday. He seems very well.<br/>No more news old girl. Very much love from your loving brother<br/>Fred</p>
