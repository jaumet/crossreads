about anywhere again now. Aunty also said she had a letter from May. She must think me a nice one I haven't written her since coming across here. I can tell you by the time one juggles these cases and things all day you don't feel like letter writing.  Must try & write her tomorrow. Did you get the Menue I posted you. Was very nicely got up wasent it. Well Father time to turn in as there isnt any Sunday at this game. Sunday is the same as Monday. Have to close now Father. love & best wishes to allYour SincereSon Clyde
