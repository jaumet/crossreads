<p>May 1916<br/>(continued)  Engrs here.  Church parade was held this morning on the edge of the desert for Engrs at which, the reinforcements by the "Star of Vic.," which arrived in camp yesterday, attended.  During the afternoon I walked out into the desert &amp; visited the old battle-field of Tel-el-Kibir, where Kitchener was, 30 years ago.  It was a very interesting sight but the bones skeletons &amp; the old relics of the battle presented a rather gastly spectacle.<br/>(see next page 13th )<br/>{19th   promoted "Temporary" Sergeant}<br/>27th-   We left Tel-el-Kibir tonight in open trucks at about 11 P.M. for Alexandria.  The order to leave came suddenly although we have been expecting to leave any day for the past week.</p>
