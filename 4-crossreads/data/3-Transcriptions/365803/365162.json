<p>9th July 1916 Sunday Night</p>
<p>Dear Judge Ferguson</p>
<p>I  [indecipherable] your offer of a seat with you but Pat   &amp;  Pixie went with me.</p>
<p>It was a fine service, and a fine service &ndash; indeed, the distinction between the "dreams" and the "Vision", was a lesson not to be forgotten</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>Dick</p>
