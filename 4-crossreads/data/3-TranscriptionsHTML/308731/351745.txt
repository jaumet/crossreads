<p>Dear old Mr Bill Burrowes</p>
<p>Mum was schasked last night because she was in the middle of us in the big bed and Ruth was one side of mum and I was the othe side of mum. and Ruth is writing a nother letter to you. and to day is Sunday so I hope I can write more. and the little goats are real funny and we call the little blackgoat golly wog and he is real heffery and when I try to caught him he dogers me round the trees.  this morning I brought mum a cup of tea because she was schasked in the night and she could not breath.  Mum is going to <strike>school</strike> church and we are not going to church.</p>
<p>much love from Frank<br/>xxx etc.<br/>ooo etc.</p>
