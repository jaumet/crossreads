for the country round about here is as level as a billiard table there is nothing to distinguish your direction by for it is all alike you can easily be walking in a circle, as other parties have done before today but my bush training stuck to me I came out as straight as an arrow, by this time the whole party were completely knocked up for it was pretty stiff work we had just come out of the firing line, their feet were all swollen painful, it was a shame to send them out at all, but then you know the old military style. Shortly after this the remainder of the Coy. came in from the firing line we had tea went to bed, after oiling washing our feet in Condy's. 
There was also a very welcome mail came in tonight.
