<p>Christmas Day<br/>Alexandrie, le 25-12-1915</p>
<p>Dear Mother</p>
<p>Here I am in Alexandria, at the Hotel Bonnard. How did I get here? &ndash; Trust me!! It is Christmas Day, and raining. I never thought I would have a wet Christmas in Egypt.</p>
<p>Am still quite well, and having a good time, but the main thing is &ndash; I'm happy. (If it wasn't for the cronk pens they give a man to write with here.)</p>
<p>Arrived in Alexandria last night, and will tell you how it is I am here in another letter, as my pal is waiting for me now to go for a drive. This place is not so big as Cairo, but much cleaner, &amp; ones sees more English people about.<br/>We went to the theatre last night. It starts pretty late here, about 11.30 or 12, &amp; the result was we arrived back at the Hotel at 2.15 am this morning. Didn't roll out til 9 &amp; then had a good breakfast. &ndash; golly, this is the life. "Who wouldn't join the Army". Honestly the boys who won't join out in Australia, don't know what they're missing. Of course there is hard work sometimes, but then you enjoy the time you get off all the more.</p>
<p>No time to write more just now, and any way I'm almost crazy trying to write with this nib, so Gook by &amp; I'll write more in a gay or two. Love to you all. Alan</p>
