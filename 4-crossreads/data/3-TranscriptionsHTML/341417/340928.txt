<p>Somewhere in Belgium<br/>15/1/18</p>
<p>Dear Miss King</p>
<p>Am dropping you a few lines hoping they will find you in the best of health as it leaves me at present. I have not received any letters from you for sometime or that parcel but as you said you expected me to come home with the first Division and writing on parcel not to be returned to you, that accounts for me not getting it, or perhaps it will come to light later on, but as long as some soldier got it, so much the better don't you think so.<br/>Well Miss King we are having very bad weather over here at present but it will soon be over now. Was very pleased to hear that the strike has ended and no doubt it was the IWW's [Industrial Workers of the World] who were the cause of all the trouble, nevertheless I believe the Police have them well in hand as a friend of mine who is a policemen gave me full particulars about it.<br/>What is Mr Hughes doing, now that he has been defeated on the conscription vote, I suppose he will try again but I am afraid the conscripts will not be required for the war must finish early this</p>
