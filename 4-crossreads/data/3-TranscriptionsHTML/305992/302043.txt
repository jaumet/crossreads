<p>The weather here it being August is very warm &amp; oppressive. We are having some very good news daily in regards of our progress in the Western front &amp; we all sincerely hope that it will be the means of a crushing defeat to the Huns &amp; sincerely hope peace will be declared in the near future.<br/>News now that submarine telephones &amp; wires are laid across the bed of the Meditterean &amp; with these they can detect the presence of Hun subs &amp; also the direction they are going hence destroyers follow same &amp; drop depth charges. Also that the latest British submarines have one 12 inch gun fitted on them which is almost uncreditable, yet a fact.</p>
<p>2.8.18<br/>Four of our sailors this day found under the influence of drink. Probably the cause of brooching beer from the ship's hold of which we have 300 tons, 6000 cases. Naval blue jackets guarding same, but yet they manage to get it &amp; no chance of any clue so far re. how they manage it.<br/>Several French cruisers full of troops from Salonika &amp; British troopships all for the Western front.</p>
