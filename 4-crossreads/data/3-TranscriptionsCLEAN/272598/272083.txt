  
 Glass fell from windows & people rushed in every direction for shelter. 
 Friday 14.7.16 Fritz shelled a battery of Artillery to the rear of us with heavy high explosive shells practically the whole of the afternoon & was successful in putting one of our 18 pounders out of action. 
 Saturday 15.7.16 Saturday 15.7.16 Again went to H.qrs fro rations & again had the experience of being under shell fire while passing through Fleurbaix.  Saw the men digging out the gun which was yesterday put out of action.  Good deal of shrapnel flying about practically the whole of the morning.  Fairly heavy bombardment commenced about 9 pm which was followed up by the Germans sending out a raiding party; gave our boys a hot time till about midnight.  We were working till about two o'clock taking over the wounded.
