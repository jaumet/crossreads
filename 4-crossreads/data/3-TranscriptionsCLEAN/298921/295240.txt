September, 1915Sunday 26Preparations for a winter campaign are being made at Gallipoli [indecipherable] Cov: iron, Trench boots stoves for cooking etc, the same as on the Continent - Church service by Rev. Capt Boardman good place here voice sounds well with rocky cliffs all around & big hollow squares - & good music. Rev Boardman was with the Bushman; but he never helped me on the strait & narrow path much but I suppose alright. Gets free Baths (sulphur) & the best time of his life here.
