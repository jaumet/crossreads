  
 February, 1915 Saturday 27 I'll cut this out today & send with love - If wealthy people want to know the best gift to a Squadron it is a  portable Kitchen  Very few are here & they are a boon to Soldiers. Pow-Wow on yesterdays work which is most interesting. Hope all are well. If possible I'll ride to the tombs of the Kaliphs this afternoon not far away.
