 Rooms &amp; had a cold lunch then we made our way back to the Station across a very slippery road &amp; still snowing hard. Having purchased each a Ticket we went along the platform &amp; joined our Train &amp; soon was speeding on our way &amp; in due course arrived at East Croydon &amp; there had to change into another Train which duly arrived &amp; off again until we arrived at Brighton, the Weather here was a lot brighter &amp; not nearly so cold. After joining another Train was soon off again to Barnham Junction through some very nice country, gardens everywhere &amp; Nurseries. We had to change again into the Bordon Train this making the 7th Change of Trains in a run of about 100 miles I was just about full of changing &amp; was glad to arrive at Bognor,.
