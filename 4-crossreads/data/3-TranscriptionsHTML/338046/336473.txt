<p>1917<br/>February<br/>to the magasine to blow it up.   &ndash; Our thoughts were full of Huns those days.  I threw a stone at the bush and heard a couple of rats squeak, and run away and after that, did not hear any more of the supposed Fritz.   On Monday we marched to Fovant, about 2 miles away to rehearse a parade for the King.   While marching back again I saw some German prisoners, the first I had seen.  They struck me as being a rather weedy lot, but others that I saw later working around the camps were fine big men.  It was said that they had been in the Prussian Guard and had been captured early in the war.   Tuesday we marched to Fovant again and waited an hour or so for him (the King) to arrive.  At last several cars drove up and out he hopped, well muffled up in a fur collared coat.   He was rather a poor specimen as regards size, and a lot of the troops were greatly taken aback at his lack of height.   He passed quite close to me but did not recognise me.</p>
