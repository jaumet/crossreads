Loafed about all day. Cpl Bovall and Connors came down about dinner time and I went to Fleurbaix to tea with them and I got into conversation with a Hillston chap and he told me Ian Fullarton was in his Battalion so I went round and found him. Ian who is a Sergeant and I had a great old yarn. He is an awfully nice chap and we have arranged another meeting next week. Had a letter from Ad. Smith and Liz Williams

Wrote to Adelaide Smith. Went to Dentist and had tooth filled. Had a good look through Bac Saint-Main and coming home met young McDermott who is in the A.S.C. One of the Freebairns is in it also. McDermott said he hadnâ€™t had any mail from home for months. Had a cup of tea and cake in the Boc-St. Mann

Took a walk to D.A.C. to see Russ & Edric. The latter went to Div. Rest Camp this morning and Russ had some trouble about not posting a guard and was asked to give in his stripes and then went into trench mortars Sailly is a fine little town on River Lys about 3 miles from Estaires. Sent letter home and got word to go back to battery tomorrow and Dick Lyons is taking my place.
