  
 The Palace, Heliopolis, Egypt Sept. 27th 1915. My dear Jane, I have been expecting a letter from home for ever so long but have been disappointed. I got one from Miss Crissie Stirling to the "Soldier Boys", with a short note to myself. I have sent it to one of the wards & the Sister said that the Boys were enjoying it & that she would pass it on to tother wards. I also let Major McLean read it & he said he would write to that lady. Thought it a very nice idea & was  sho  sure the soldiers would enjoy it. It was a really a splendid letter. Sister Martin came to see me this morning, she returned last night. She said you were all well & that you sent your love etc. I was glad she managed to see you all. She is looking very well though they had a very busy time only two sisters & 1500 troops, so she would have plenty of work to do. She will be working at Luna Park again but is to have a couple of days off duty. So I  shall see her again to day some time.
