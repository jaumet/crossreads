Tuesday 3rd April 1917Grooming and cleaning harnesses all day.Paid 40 franksPozieres (cont)by dozens from the little 12 pounder up to the immense 15 inch. You stumble through barbed wire (some of it German with sharp iron spikes put in the ground under it). When you arrive at Pozieres you would not think that at one time it was a peaceful village. All that is left is heaps of bricks                          and timber, and all the trees has been blown to pieces by shell fire.1st Div. took Pozieres2nd Div. held it.
