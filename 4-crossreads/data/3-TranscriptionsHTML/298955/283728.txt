On the left here nothing but tropical vegetation, coconut palms etc. The French tried to construct  this Canal but failed owing to not having exterminated the germ carrying mosquito whose bite used to cause malarial &amp; other fevers. The French expended 80,000,000 dollars.<br/>The first thing the Yankees did was to exterminate all the disease germs.

Thus having killed &amp; removed the cause of the fevers etc the Americans set to work &amp; succeeded in constructing building  &amp; carrying out one of the greatest pieces of engineering work ever undertaken in the world. Money in this case was no object.</p>
