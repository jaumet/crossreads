<p>8th July (Saturday)</p>
<p>Started out at 9 a.m. carrying all our belongings and two blankets and entered upon a heavy march of 11&frac12; miles over rough cobble-stone roads.  1000 out of 4000 dropped out up to mid-day.  This refers to infantry.  Of our Section none dropped out.  Passing through Merville we reached Estaires about 4 p.m. and slept in the old Town Hall building for the night.  There was an air fight this afternoon resulting in the Fritz plane backing out.</p>
