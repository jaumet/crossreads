<p>Thursday 1 June 1916<br/>A glorious day again. Had to take a fatigue party out in the morning &amp; so missed a big brigade parade &amp; inspection by Mr. Hughes &amp; Mr. Fisher, other heads as Gen. Birdwood also being present. From what I heard I did not miss much. The day was evidently a very special one with the French, a number of girls in pure white throughout &amp; boys with white bands &amp; rosettes being seen everywhere, &amp; the people in their best clothes. Got back from fatigue before lunch &amp; went up to the divisional baths where I had a lovely hot bath followed by a cold shower. Great aerial activity on our part while the inspection was on.<br/>Busy censoring letters &amp;c. during the afternoon &amp; evening. Very heavy bombardment away to the SSW towards St. Eloi(?)</p>
