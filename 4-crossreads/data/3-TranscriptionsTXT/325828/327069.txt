 It is getting very cold up here now (October) &amp; I think we are in for a severe winter I am keeping well, &amp; am anxious to get to school of Military Aeronautics so as to classify for my Pilots Certificate   Meanwhile I am working quietly, for it will all come in handy. I am glad Walters arm is getting on satisfactorily, &amp; trust it will continue to improve. Must close now as I am trying to squeeze in a note to Ol. With much love to each &amp; all of you at home, &amp; regrets that I am not able to give it you personally Ever your loving Leo.
