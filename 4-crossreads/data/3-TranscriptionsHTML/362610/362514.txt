<p>Wednesday 25 October 1916<br/>Dull &amp; threatening morning with rain later in the day : miserably cold &amp; MUDDY. During the morning stayed in the tent &amp; got my Xmas cards away. In the afternoon went up some distance towards the line to try &amp; find an unoccupied tent to bring back, but without success. A cold night again &amp; during it a number of enemy shells landed round about us. In one short break in the weather counted 38 aeroplanes up &amp; abt. 20 sausage balloons.</p>
