 Tue. 2nd Apl. (cont.) Dinner over, &amp; we were consuming lager, coffee ersatz, &amp; cigarettes when two young ladies sat down at our table &ndash; it was the only vacant space in the room.   We had quite a chatty time for an hour or so &ndash; they did not understand a word of English and my German provided the amusement of the party.   Then my unteroffizier, beaming and kameradish owing to the feed I had given him, actually proposed going home to his flat for the evening.   (He lived at Hamburg.) 
 We crossed the imposing Bahnhof Platz and boarded an "electrischer", via the Rathaus Platz and St. Pauli finally reaching a place out near Hagenbecks Tier Park.   I kept well out of sight on the darkened back of the car during the journey.
