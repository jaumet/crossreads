<p>17th Dec 1918</p>
<p>I am writing up the diary tonight in the dynamo room of a large farm a third of the way from Bengnies to Le Chatelet, which is our destination beyond Charleroi.  After many false rumours of  moving off we actually started off this morning, which was three weeks after we arrived.  Our stay was supposed to be for one week only, but was drawn out to three by repeated  postponements of our departure.</p>
<p>By the time we came to leave our little white cottage by the side of the main road ( which I now know goes from Avesnes to Charleroi &amp; is only a semi main road)  &amp; I  had become very much attached to the family, &amp; particularly to Jeanne, whom I had been teaching English with not slight success.</p>
