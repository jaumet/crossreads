 - Back here again up on the Post things are very quiet - they don't think they can attack us & we do not get orders to attack them - firing - shelling, bombing & grenading however go on with easy sequence all day & most of the night. All parties seem to be sapping very hard & we can occasionally lob a bomb into the midst of one of their parties. 
 Writing here is difficult - - the seating accomodation is poor - the position cramped - the interruptions many - flies absolutely intolerable - Heat about 88 & no shade except a blanket roof. Smith the censor  Adamant  as to time of closing; indigestion & sickishness from food & cramped positions - weak legs from want of exercise - brains dull from want of being able to use them. Enough grumbles! 
 Have written more money to Cairo for rice - matches - tobacco - envelopes - none to hand yet. - - Yr letters very welcome & re-read - nice reading about you & the kiddies
