Fleas & Insects
Insects of various species commonly & better known as lice, were our worst constant companions & they used to stick to us with more tenacity & friendship than the greatest of all our friends.  Though constantly served with clean underwear they did not take long to accumulate for water was scarce, & we scarcely had even a sponge for weeks on end. the clothes were soon dirty again, the lice found their resting place, & we  consequently  suffered the tortures of an everlasting tickling sensation which could only be overcome with a violent frontal attack with our nails as a substitute for the bayonet.
