  
 to Scotts Redoubt, where I joined my Battalion Signallers. I took a keen interest in the Signallers work and took every opportunity to study it, with the result that I soon became efficient to take my shift on the phone in the trenches. After being in this camp, Scotts Redoubt, for a few days, we were marched towards the trenches again to another camp named Acid-drop Camp, where we did fatigues up to the front line for a week, and then moved up to the Le Sars front. 
 We camped in Gun Pit Alley, which runs through the "had been" village of Martinpuich, and worked on a light railway that ran up to the front line. This railway was much used at night, and we had to keep the line in order as far as possible. The Germans constantly shelled the line and tore it up in places, and we had to keep pace with the repairing as well as possible. Sometimes there would be a dozen trucks waiting to pass on the line when we were working, and the unhealthy oaths that were shouted out by the truck-pushers, made us who were mending the line, understand that they did not want to be held up longer than could be avoided, in such a dangerously shelled place. 
 Some nights when we had finished our strenuous work on the line we would go back to our dugouts only to be called  up in half an hour by the Sergeant Major and sent up to the front line with plum pudding bombs for the trench mortars. These bombs were nearly 80 lbs weight, and by the time we had walked three miles to the front line in mud and snow we felt very fatigued. After we had discharged our burden we would sit for a while, and then go back empty handed to our dugout in Gun Pit Alley, where we would arrive just at daylight. When we did sleep we slept soundly, as this was evidenced by our not waking when a shell blew our sandbag entrance of the dugout, down. We only found out what had happened when one of our party had occasion to go and see the sergeant who was living further down the Alley. 
 While in Martinpuich we inspected the ruins of the village, and it was a good sample of German destruction. Everywhere was to be seen, broken carts, harnesses, ploughs, household furniture, and the remains of demolished houses. I  must make mention of a very large German dud-shell which stood near a dug-out; it was about 5 feet high and about 15 inches in diameter, and I believe, came from a range of 25 mile.
