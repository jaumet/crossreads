I am writing Father separately this mail, also acknowledging your Christmas Cable - I hope mine from Alexandria went through allright.
I had a great surprise when I heard of Myra G's wedding - Mary also told me they were not expecting it to take place quite so soon. Mary sent me some sox & other things at Christmas. Sis also sent me a parcel and Mrs Forsyth so things altogether have been good.

We are having a fairly good time now. The weather is lovely and reorganisation & training is just about to commence. We are still at sixes
