My dearest Mother   & Sisters
No letters this week from Aust. it seems ages since I last heard from home. Suppose shall have to wait patiently now. Anyhow no news is good-news.
The weather is delightful   & everything is much brighter. I'm on Night-duty   &  rather enjoying it, the work is very light   &  the nights go by very quickly.
Our Sister-in-charge (Miss O'Dwyer) has been honoured with the R.R.C. (Royal Red Cross)
