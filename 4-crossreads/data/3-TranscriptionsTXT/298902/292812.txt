Saturday 21st Dec  Busy in the morning unloading wagons & distributing gear around to the different departments & saw the Colonel about going into Charleroi for comforts etc for sick in Battalions etc.  He gave me a car for the trip in the afternoon & also took some sick to Hospital also a S/Sgt going on leave to Paris.  Set off about 2.30 & found the main road in a shocking state, reaching Charleroi about 22 miles just on dark.  Got rid of patients then parked the car in the Square & set to, to see the place, it being too late to do my business, so decided to stop the night.  I found it to be a large city, like Amiens & brilliantly lit with electricity, the shops being fairly well stocked & windows well dressed.  Things were dear such as bacon being 5/- a lb but otherwise everything entirely normal.  German money in full circulation, the mark being worth 17.25.
