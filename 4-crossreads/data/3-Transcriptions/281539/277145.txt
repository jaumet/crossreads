<p>6/9/15  In the distance Imros stands out &ndash; in the foreground scattered vessel warships &amp; store ships lying at anchor. Looking down &ndash; a large gully sandy, steep on both sides with scattered scrub something like Faithfulls creek basin without the creek. 2pm. Went through trenches with Guilfoyle, took long periscope. Looking through periscope there was nothing in sight but a confused mass of earth &amp; sandbags about 250 yards in front &ndash; Turkish trenches running parallel to our line right along. Absolutely no one in sight and yet beneath the parapet they are in their thousands. Our trenches a network of deep trenches as confused as the catacombs of Rome surely. The support trenches have recesses cut in them for sleeping purposes where men rest. The fire trench is full of observers &amp; others specially armed and always on the alert.</p>
<p>Enemies shrapnel bursting towards Rest Gully from the gun Beachy Bill. When it opened fire we were passing a big group resting on open spot. One to others "Hullo boys if you want to live come back here or old Beachy will have a say" A few good shells bursting about</p>
