November 1915has been received by the regiment & we got a fair issue of extras.
Monday 15th to Sunday 21stAll our Xmas mail posted on the 14th for Australia met with disaster the boat carrying it was torpedoed between Lemnos & Alexandria.  My promotion to corporal has been confirmed.  The weather has been very trying & cold, on Tuesday night the wind & rain for an hour or so was something to remember.  Was too cold to sleep that night.  Bombing was constant on both sides during the week & Abdul has been paying a good deal of attention to the 2nd Brigade's position with his artillery, Ryrie's post, Chatham's & Wilson's Outlook all getting their share.  Segt K Alford, who was our troop sergeant at one time received a commission, so also did a lot of others in the 6th about 8 altogether
