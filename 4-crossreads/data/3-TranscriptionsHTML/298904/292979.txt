<p>On the 15th there was a terrific bombardments of Achi Baba" our warships fairly rained shells on the Turks for hours, how on earth they could stand it gets me for we could feel the concussion even where we were, we always had a splendid view of these bombardments for we overlooked all the country between Anzac &amp; Achi Baba"  Krithia at times could hardly be seen for smoke &amp; dust it must have been a perfect Hell there<br/>One of the prettiest sights I have seen at Anzac" was one day when 6 cruisers bombarded the Olive Grove, they stood about a mile off the shore &amp; if they didn't paste the batteries there it was a caution, sometimes they would fire the whole broadside</p>
