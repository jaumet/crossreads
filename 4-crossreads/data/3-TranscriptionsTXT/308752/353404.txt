 6th Edition 1st January 1917. New Years Day, &amp; a bitterly cold one too, a great difference to that of last year, which we spent in the oppressive heat of Egypt. Of course a holiday was granted to all. Eric, Bob &amp; I went for a long walk it was enjoyable in spite of the severe cold, the country was looking very fine, the fields looking beautifully fresh &amp; green. 
 A number of members of the unit have been very busy during the past week arranging a Concert for New Years Night. They call themselves the "Night Birds Pierrot Concert Party". Naturally every one expected something good &amp; I can assure you that the show turned out a great success, &amp; considering the short time that the concert was arranged the artists deserve much praise. Eric &amp; Bob were amongst the performers. 
 For the next fortnight the same old routine took place each day, fatigues, drill etc &ndash; &amp; the weather was a perisher too. 
 14th January. 
 After having a well earned rest the Bearers again were off, to do some work in the Trenches.
