<p>During this turn in the front line area it was worked on twenty four hours to a shift for one half of the company would occupy the front line while the other half occupied the supports &amp; vice versa being changed over each night after dark. Supports were situated in a very spacious dug out well below the ground which had been made by our battalion miners &amp; the troops were very comfortable in for it was very warm  wire bunks had been erected inside for the men to sleep in. The duties were nil for no movement about ground was allowed by day &amp; very little by night for the position was one of secret &amp; only about a hundred yards in rear of the front line. This part of the front was called the Maize owing to the number of enemy trenches &amp; strong points which dominated the place &amp; was considered to be an exceptionally strong place. It was during the early part of the night of the 8th that the 1st Battalion arrived &amp; relieved our battalion when we moved back to No 5 Camp at Bozintin. This camp was very comfortable for it consisted of huts well fitted out with stoves which were a great comfort owing to the severe cold weather. The following day half our company was sent to Clarkes Dump near Highwood on fatigue work which made the duties at Bazintin much easier for those who remained. I was left at the camp where things jogged along very quietly with hardly anything to do except keeping the camp clean. During the early hours of the 25th the troops were roused &amp; told to "stand to" for it was found that the enemy had evacuated their forward positions which caused a considerable amount of excitement. Extra gear &amp; ammunition was hurriedly issued, the half company was returned from Clarke's Dump &amp; orders issued for everyone to be ready to move off at a moments notice for at that time it was not definitely the reasons of the Huns evacuation. Our stay in the above camp lasted another two days &amp;<br/>[Image includes a hand drawn sketch titled "Rough Sketch Maize Sector]</p>
