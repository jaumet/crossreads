  
 up town to procure the eaters if it!  Absolutely laid themselves out to do what was possible for the Australians.  I can tell you we enjoyed it.  They were two married ladies so goodness only knows what their hubbies will say eh.  The lady whose house they took us to was a grand old scotch dame who called us wee laddies, or Sodger boys, and who shook hands with both hands.

British Rule they have thrived under, and they admit it, but British they are not, nor will they stir to help Britain.  These are facts I gathered there & facts perhaps unknown to people in Australia, and
