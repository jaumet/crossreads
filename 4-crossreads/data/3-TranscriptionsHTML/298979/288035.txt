<p>&amp; begged for seats, from the deference paid by the Usher, the Sentry concluded they were people of some importance so he dashed up the stairs after them, &amp; as they handed in their cards the Sentry handed in his. The Inside Usher was at once called &amp; sent away to try &amp; find "Room" for Mr [dash]'s party of <u>three</u>. Mr [dash] immediately turned to see who made the party of <u>"three"</u> but the Sentry had discreetly retired a short distance &amp; was interested in the architecture of the building, particularly the ceiling with an occasional glance at the portal leading to the Assembly Chamber. When the Usher returned the Sentry judiciously closed up, to form the "proper party" &amp; sedately proceeded along with his new found companions.</p>
<p>However once past the "barrier" the Sentry's progress was very much more leisurely, not wishing to make the acquaintanceship too pointed, thus affording them  time to secure seats, unattended by their strange friend in uniform; but he did notice the Usher had placed <u>him</u> in a seat immediately behind <u>them</u>.</p>

<p>However when Botha rose he was plainly in view, a fine looking, largely built, strong man, &amp; although he also spoke in Dutch his gestures &amp; mannerisms were so transparent that one could almost follow every phrase.</p>
<p>The dignity, the scorn, the ridicule, the earnestness, the pleading, then the final decision to proceed along a track on which he thought the Country could travel in safety, at whatever cost</p>
