it & don't trouble about it now.  My father, in a letter, bewailed the fact that Mr. Hughes had been manhandled in Warwick", but I've written back saying serve the bugger right".  That's all the policy I've got & hope you agree.
This College is very fine.  Tons of sport, swimming (50 yds. takes me 42 sec.) boating, football &c.  We also have organ recitals in the Chapel.  The virginal picture Light of the World" is here also.  You'll remember it coming to Sydney when we were in our early twenties, now, alas, many years ago (or so it seems).
Hope Mrs. Vol & the family are O.K.  Is Violette married yet?  I often wonder.
Best wishes;  I'm looking forward to getting a letter from you soon.
Your old palArthur Hine
