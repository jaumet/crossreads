 grow in the Laboratory &amp; I arranged to have a marconigram sent on after us with a report. In this way we got a message 800 miles out from Capetown reporting the names of 6 "carriers" who were promptly isolated on the poop deck aft.

With Kindest remembrances to you &amp; Mrs Ferguson &amp; Dorothy &amp; hoping  to  you are all well, I remain Yours sincerely M M [indecipherable] Sinclair
