been isolated as I have Scabies Just an irritable rash. Have been bathed in disinfectant & rubbed all over twice today with a yellow sort of ointment. A lot of Sulphur in it. Live by ourselves but can go about as we like. Three men came in to day from Loose - one of our jails. In the Army it seems the correct thing to tell all about your crimes, In fact rather to glory in them. These chaps have not been allowed to talk so are making up for it now
