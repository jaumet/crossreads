  
 experience.  I made use of 3 windows for passing the stuff in & had the Sgts on definite jobs & all went very smoothly.  Tea, the men served themselves.  I picked out two trusty Corporals who picked out their own Mess orderlies so that tea was also a success.  Then they had a bridge tournament & concert, followed by supper & it was voted the best Christmas say they have had in the army, so I was well pleased.  The Sgts had dinner at 6.  It was not as good a meal as the men had but there was a fair quantity of liquor so all was merry with several stretcher cases to deal with at 10 oclock.  Altogether a very successful day.  Managed to get to bed about 11 oclock after having a bit of a dance to wind up with.  Snowed last night.
