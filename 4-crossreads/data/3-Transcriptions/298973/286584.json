A more uninteresting place it would be hard to[XB1] imagine, nothing but desert on all sides as far as you can see.The only redeeming feature about the place is the swimming in the canal,and though it is a good walk down across the loose heavy sand, we generally manage to get down for a dip every day.

Plenty of ships pass through while we are down there, and it must be a wonderful sight to see both banks of the canal, lined with thousands of troops, all burnt so brown, that we may easily be mistaken for Indians or Egyptians. And don't the boats get a cheer especially if they happen to be from Australia. The passengers throw books,papers,and tins of tobacco and cigarettes over</p>
