<p>today but I remained back until next day when A &amp; B Sections hand over. O.S. for the day. In the morning I went up to Birr Crossroads to collect stores &amp; hand over the place to the 1st Field.  Things were fairly quiet except for our Artillery but this section of the road is perhaps the most dangerous of any in this region. A tremendous amount of traffic is always on hand &amp; it is lined with Ammunition dumps for the concealment of which is practically impossible. Hell Fire Corner perhaps the hottest part has a particularly bad reputation, rarely a day goes by without casualties occurring here &amp; dead horses and smashed waggons with the remains of exploded &amp; burnt out dumps line the road. I have known days when the casualties from this section of the road exceeded those from the line &amp; yet the stream of traffic carries on. Our guns are so numerous that concealment is impossible, they simply lie in the open with camouflage netting over</p>
