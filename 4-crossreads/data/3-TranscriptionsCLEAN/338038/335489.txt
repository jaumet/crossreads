 "Woodleigh" Salisbury St. Watson's Bay 27/4/18 
 Dr. Sir Excuse an entire stranger forwarding to you this sympathetic communication. It is with sincere regret that I noticed the death of your noble son in France. My son has been associated with your son Major Garling for a long time in France & possibly may have been with him till the end.  At least I know for he has often noted in his letters to me that your son Major Garling was held in the highest esteem both as an officer & a gentleman by the men in his Battery. My daughter & self extent to you our sincere heartfelt sympathy in your sad bereavement trusting you may derive a morsel of comfort from the esteem in which he was held by the men fighting under him. I am Dr. Sir Yours Respectfully Rob. S.M.Cormick
