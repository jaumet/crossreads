The gas officer explained the different sorts of gas the Germans send over, now classed as Blue Cross, Green Cross, & Yellow Cross gas. We put on our respirators while gas shells were fired, & then had a smell of the different gases, so that we'll know the smell the minute Fritz sends it over, & get our respirators on quickly. Then they fired some projectors (empty), which flew through the air like big drums, so that we'll know them. We came back to Allonville & had lunch, the field cookers made a drink of cocoa there. The 4th Machine Gun Coy were holding sports at Allonville, & instead of being marched home, we were given leave to go to the sports. They had no attractions for anybody, especially as we were hampered with rifles & equipment, Foster & I waited wearily on the roadside for a lift; after an hour & a half, we got a lift to Querrieu in an Aussie wagon, on which many more stragglers hopped as it went along. Then we sat down for a good while, & finally got on a Tommy wagon which took us nearly to our 'pozzy', where we arrived about 6 p.m., very tired & had a hot meal, stew & tea. Had another letter from Bon this evening, he was just going on more leave &
