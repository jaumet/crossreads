Up 8.30 and had breakfast in hut near Public Library. We all stayed there talking till noon then went to 21st St to a friend of Henschalls. Came back to hut and had lunch then went to Friars Club for hour or so, having received our membership cards from Keighlty this morning. Met a chap who had just arrived from Australia by the Ventura and another chap showed us some tricks on the billiard table. Came back to hut and had tea then four of us went to the Hippodrome which is a very fine show.
Arrived home 11.15 pm. Nice fine day.

Up 8 am and had breakfast here. Took bus down Fifth Avenue to 28th St and arrived at Cornell Medical School just on 11 am. Saw Dr Sheldon and he showed my heart to several of the students, but only scoring one dollar from him. He then handed me over to Dr Holland the X Ray expert and I went to Holland's rooms in East 40th St and he investigated my interior with the fleuroscope. He reckons the stomach is slightly out of gear as well and wanted to put me into the hospital for a week but I am not willing. When finished went for stroll to the Pennsylvania Ry Terminal in 7th Avenue and 32rd St and looked over it, then went up to Library Hut for tea and met the other chaps.
Came home early the others going to the pictures. Fine day.
