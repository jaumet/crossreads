<p>free to see all we could for the next 3 days</p>
<p>Well Brussels is a very well laid out city and very pretty and one can imagine how much prettier it must appear in Spring with all its freshness and greenery</p>
<p>The main road or Boulevarde as it is called is a grand thoroughfare of great width and considerable length, running from one end of the city to the other</p>
<p>The "Gare du Midi" (Railway Stn) is situated at South End while the Gare de Nord is at the other.</p>
<p>There are several squares</p>
