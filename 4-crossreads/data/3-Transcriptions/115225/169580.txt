<p>June 21<u><sup>st</sup></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;We went out to&nbsp;Fr&eacute;chencourt with supplies &amp; on our way home took a load of hay about three kilos past Longpr&eacute; les Amiens &amp; one of the 4<u><sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp;M.T. lorries was on the same job - We called back to Monti&egrave;res &amp; picked up Mademoiselle &amp; her Mother for La Chauss&eacute;e. I had two bunches of roses to-day &amp; gave one to Gisele &amp; the other to Zita. the living room of Zita&#39;s house opens onto the road &amp; always when the door is open . the scent of the roses permeates the atmosphere outside the roses are added to every day &amp; the wilting ones thrown out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>June 22<sup><u>nd</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We went out to&nbsp;Fr&eacute;chencourt with supplies &amp; on the way home picked up a load of furniture &amp; took it to Picquigny, unloading it, &amp; carrying it past the A.P.M.S office, to the back yard. orders came out to-day that carying furniture for the civils would in future be a court martial offense - Jno &amp; I spent the evening with Zita as usual &nbsp;The weather has been rather cold with a little rain this week &amp; we never have time for a swim now, even if the weather invited it, which it dose&#39;nt -</p>
