time.  I am able to see a difference in the wound every time I dress it.  I am going to keep on with the Salve & am confident that in a week or so, with care, I will be able to report it healed.  I way was lying up on Friday for 1/2 a day with it, & kept on hot poultices which took down the inflammation a good deal.  There is really nothing to worry about now, Father dear, for I am taking every possible care of it.I see by to-night's casualty list one of Rev. B.J. Meek's sons (Private R.S.) has been killed.I have been trying to get into communication with Horace Walker who was Glen Innes Exp. Farm as Experimentalist & as a last resource I wrote to the Manager a week ago asking him for Horace's address.  He replied that it was Sargeant Horace Walker, etc. etc. etc. Liverpool Camp; so that he has enlisted for active service.  Any chance of my going, Dad?It still keeps dry up here; we are still sowing, & have about another fortnight's work to finish.  I will be jolly glad when we have done, as it is a very busy time for us now.Must close now, with love to all at home,Your loving son,Leo.P.S. Many thanks for your explanation of different words.  It is very good of you to trouble about them for me.
