  
 April 8th Our party (24) take up duties in 2nd Division Baths-work very trying and oppressive owing chiefly to heat of rooms. New French friends (coffee). Shelling and bombardment about out abode-Baths 1/2 mile from Armentieres. April 9th Work on drying room. Sunday 9 but no holiday (Our first glimpse of " Mad Major"-200 shells wasted by Huns) Leave in afternoon to Armentiers.
