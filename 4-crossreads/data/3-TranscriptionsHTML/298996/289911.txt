<p>3.6.15<br/>The weather here is of the best. daybreaks about 3 oclock Dusk about half past eight. There was little or nothing doing today until one of our Aeroplanes flew over to the Turks lines whom fired two shrapnels shells at it, but they went wide of the mark. The Turk snipers are still busy firing at the boys swimming. We are made to go &amp; swim further around the front where they cannot fire at us.</p>
