<p>My dearest Mother   &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>Well no doubt you will be surprised to hear that I've had another move since writing to you last. On Monday last we were all sent from our own C.C. Stations.</p>
<p>The wretched Bosch was too fond of us, so sent a few shells   &amp;  bombs too near.</p>
<p>The Sisters all got orders to quit so the eleven senior Sisters (old staff) were sent here, not far from our own camp &ndash; the others sent further back &ndash; Some of them were suffering from shell shock</p>
