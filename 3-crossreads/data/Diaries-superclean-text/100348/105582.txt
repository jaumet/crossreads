destruction they were causing in his trenches; and he opened up with his guns and tore the landscape about considerably. The rations are good here and we are able to get hot meals, for which Allah be praised!
30/6/16. 
Yesterday we suffered a terrific bombardment. The worst we have had yet. Our guns were active also and blasted the german trenches with a hurricane of fire. There is something unusual in the wind, for there are curious preparations going on; our rifles and ammunition have to be kept copiously oiled, and gas helmets are worn in the "alert" position. A squadron of 20 of our aeroplanes disappeared over the hun lines this evening. The most I've ever seen at one time. There will be a hot time in Hunland tonight.
