 [note attached to letter 7 May 1916] 
 Well dear just a little about myself & habits. I am in a Company with 5 other officers all good fellows & old hands. 3 of us were in old "G" Coy together "years ago": our O.C. is a Major Rowlands from Manly. We are a very happy family mess together always. I am mess secretary & have to keep up a good table, one thing about fighting in France we have lots of big canteens where one can buy anything so at a cost of about 20/- a week we live very well. They are giving us leave now, a very small percentage though, one of our family is away now & when he returns another goes, we get 10 days.
