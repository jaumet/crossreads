 March 1918  April Monday 1st April Got 1 letter only in the Australian mail from Doug.  Cant understand why some letters have not arrived.  2 mails have been missed now.  Usual morning work.  Went to the picnic in the afternoon.  There were 14 or 15 of us at the Pyramids altogether &amp; we had some good fun &amp; took plenty of grub etc.  Felt very tired when I got home. 
 Tuesday 2nd April No further particulars as to the casualties in the Regt have been received, but Corp Marriott who was to have relieved me here is in hospital.
