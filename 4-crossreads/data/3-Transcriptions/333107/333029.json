<p>Thur. Apt. 18<br/>Busy day. Heard today that all men who are not C class are to be replaced by C class men on staff jobs, so it looks as if the 'ashers are coming "the proverbial".</p>
<p>Friday Apr. 19<br/>Got my "marching out" orders today, together with Arthur Foster (3 Troop[?] and Toby Nicholson (14 Batt.)</p>
<p>Rep'd to orderly Room and Toby and I were put in Hut 11, 7 Camp. Foster got a job on the Messing Staff.</p>
<p>Sat. Ap. 20</p>
<p>Showery day. Went for Route March.</p>
<p>After Tea Toby, Bill Beards, George Lawson and I went into Warminster. We Houp-lade and played darts and had a few little sips of Light refreshment.</p>
<p>Warminster is quite lively on a Saturday night as most of the crowd from 1 C P and O T B get there. We arrived back in Camp just on Lights out after one of the most pleasant nights I have spent since being in Blighty.</p>
