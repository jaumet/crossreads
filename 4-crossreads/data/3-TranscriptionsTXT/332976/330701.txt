 May 1916. Nothing exciting has happened but I have had a good look around &amp; visited Cairo on Saturday 13th &amp; saw the Pyramids &amp; Sphinx. The water at Tel-el-Kibir is not of the best although there is plenty of it &amp; if drunk in excess will cause dysentry.  At Tel-el-Kibir 35,000 troops (Aust  &amp;  Eng. &amp; N.Z.) were camped most of which were Australians who will leave with us tonight or tomorrow.  At Serapium, on the canal 17,000 (Aust &amp; Eng.) are camped in readiness for an attack.  A few scrapes with the Turks have been had there lately &amp; it is only about 25 miles from where we were.  On the 19th inst. I was appointed on the staff temporily &amp; will continue to draw  extra  full duty pay.  About the 10th,  about  14 of the officers from the School arrived here &amp; take up duties  here .
