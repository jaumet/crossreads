3.2.17, [18] SundayParade at 9.  No officers and dismissed.  Chopped wood and read in morning, gained pass with bike to Locre and started at 1.30 to Bailleul.  Hodgson had just gone up from aerodrome and I went on to Locre.  Light Horse had moved so returned to Bailleul and had a good look round and to Y.M.C.A. for tea and then spent an hour with Hodgson.  Previously had watched Handly Page ascend from aerodrome close by and was also interested in the Scout (R.F.C.) [Royal Flying Corps].  Hodgson showed me his bus & I got home about 7.  Very interesting &
