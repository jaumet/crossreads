 Victoria Hotel, Damascus June 14th 1919 
 Dear Major Greenwood 
 I propose visiting Amman where I am told you are a big power in the land. 
 My work here should be completed within the next 4 days and I strike out for your country with two other ranks, two tin Lizzies &amp; many pleasant anticipations of meeting you again. 
 From Amman I go to E. Salt &amp; then back into the swelter of Cairo. 
 Hoping to be fortunate enough to find you. 
 Yours Ever 
 G.W. Lambert (Capt.) Official Artist, A.I.F. 
 Please forgive omission of your correct title &amp; Decorations which I have forgotten, they must be on the increase.
