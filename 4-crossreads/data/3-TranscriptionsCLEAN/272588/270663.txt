  
 Wednesday 20 February "Stiffness".  Very wet day making the football ground at Meteren very wet & slippery.  The match against 1st Battn. resulted in a heavy defeat for us 22-nil.  The Battalion play was superior in all respects & the better team won. 
 Thursday 21 February Most glorious day.  A Euchre party at night was a success, I winning six games of twelve.
