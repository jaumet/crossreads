<p>1918<br/>Oct. 3-8<br/>road, the skeleton of some big factory, only the ironwork remaining. The whole countryside seemed dead; no grass, no trees, only desolation. it seemed twice as gloomy as Messines, and that was bad enough. We marched back to Roisel, getting clear of the trench system and took up our possies in dugouts about 500 yards from the railway line. Rummy was the great card game here. We played nothing else all day long. I celebrated by buying a packet of cheap cigars. Smoked one and was very sorry so gave the rest to my cobbers. They smoked one each and were sorry too &ndash; I think even sorrier than I was. Bill Collins and Faddy returned to the Battn, one from the nucleus, the other from his prison cell. There was a big gun on a special truck in a siding at the Roisel railway station about 500 yards from the camp. A locomotive used to push it up to it's correct position, and then it would fire. The   <strike>concussion</strike> recoil was such that it used to send the loco together with its own truck</p>
