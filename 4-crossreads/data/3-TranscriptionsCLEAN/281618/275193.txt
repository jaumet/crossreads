[Sketch at side of entries for Dates 17th and 18th]17th  Still N.W. cloudy, long slight roll from N, beginning to chop at mid-day. Breezy. Getting cooler. Very slow travelling warship starboard (astern) at reveille. Detailed for submarine guard. Had hair cut other day - have the inevitable cold.18th  Guard . Have good position broad deck immediately with Bridge. Heavy roll. Good view of our little fleet- its very funny to see how some of the ships behave. Pt. Melbourne, right ahead, side steps each swell like a giant crab; sometimes she actually jumps about 25 to 30 yds & looks as if she is trying to steam sideways. 19th Saw a few fine [indecipherable] & a splendid display of phosphorescence last night but no Subs. Had the pleasure of reporting the [indecipherable] twice - there's something fishy about that ship. Ever since leaving Freetown she has shown a bright light each night Escort, I believe, roared at her twice but last night same thing occurred. The light showed at intervals from different parts of the ship; usually a porthole, all night. Think there's some swine there trying to put the show away. OC came to look this morning & there's going to be hells delight for some of her people.Spent the day malingering up under the gun platform. Did not seem worth while to parade. Auction sale of dead men's property. - I
