Dear Miss King
Just a few more lines from the trenches to let you see I am still in the land of the living although I am not in the best of health at present. I was slightly gassed about a week ago and it made me feel very sick and it was the most miserable time I have ever had.
I am well on the road to mend again only for a sore throat. The gas that Fritz used on use effects the throat terribly and nearly chokes you, but I may tell you he got some of the same stuff back for his trouble.Well Miss King I hope you are all well at Elga and that
