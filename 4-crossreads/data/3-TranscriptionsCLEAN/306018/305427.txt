  
 May 1917 moved out across the Wadi after dark & we travelled E.S.E. to El Bugger getting there before daylight.  The Turks were not occupying it in force & their patrols retired, so there was nothing doing.  Enemy planes raided the Hospital & burnt our aerodrome at Belah.  There were 60 casualties, mostly in the hospital 
 Monday 7th We returned from El Bugger early & got back to camp at 9 oclock.  We were all feeling tired & after getting a feed we got in a good sleep. 
 Tuesday 8th We were detailed in the morning for putting out wire over the Wadi.  We fixed up over 1/2 a mile & finished up at 4 oclock.  Got in a supply of canteen stuff so ought to live well for a day or two. 
 Wednesday 9th Reveille at 3.30 am.  Had breakfast & the Brigade got away at 4.45, watered & travelled towards Beersheba.  We came under fire at 7.30 am.  The Turkish cavalry patrols withdrew to their prepared positions so we sat all the morning on two hills watching each other  We returned after lunch & got back to camp at 3 oclock.  2 enemy planes came over about 5 oclock & dropped 20 bombs.  Ernie Paul came over to see me 
 Thursday 10th Had a quiet day in camp 
 Friday 11th Another day in camp, no fatigues  In the afternoon saw a duel in the air
