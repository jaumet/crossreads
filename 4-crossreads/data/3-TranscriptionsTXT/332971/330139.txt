His father &amp; brother are in Egypt. We hear that the Captain is bound to send him back from Colombo. This morning we had a full parade of the 3rd Aus Hep unit. Twas an outdoor uniform affair &ndash; we filled the spacious 1st Class Dining Saloon. After the roll was called Colonel Fiaschi gave a short address to us all. There was the Officers, Sisters, Non-Commissioned officers &amp; men. He strongly impressed on us the mission of our work and now that we had left Aus behind there was no such thing as States between us &ndash; just a united Aus. Unit going forth ready to give our best for the Empire. I think we all felt proud to be a mite in the unit. I know I did and especially when I glanced around &amp; saw the familiar faces of Drs Cudmore &amp; de Crespigny. Enough for tonight. My room mate will be wondering what has become of me. Good night all.
