They object to go back on to the ship again, because if they do so, they will be quarantined again on reaching Sydney.  They also make out that the ship is "chatty".  Addressed by a young officer who explained away the grievance very well.</p>
<p>Dec. 1st<br/>Embarked on the "Port Sydney" at three o'clock to-day.<br/>In the forenoon the sea was very rough, but it gradually calmed down in the afternoon.  We have had a splendid time over in the quarantine station, plenty to eat, nothing to do.</p>
<p>Dec. 4th<br/>Since coming on board</p>
