<p>They have got a nice church here &amp; I was in it for a while, it is amusing to watch the French people coming into church, they first all walk up to the "Holy water" &amp; then cross themselves &amp; when they get opposite the altar, they bend their knee right down, the place was full of little girls &amp; most of them were praying &amp; a few were saying "confession" in their little boxes.<br/>Any amount of women barbers at work here, it seems funny to watch them  Saw Captain Jackson &amp; Lieut. Beckett this evening they have just come back from England<br/>On the way down we saw a pretty sight 2 aeroplanes starting off for their flight, they work up a great pace before they leave the ground</p>
