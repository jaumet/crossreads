Tuesday 11th May.Orders received at 10am to go alongside water boat, we went alongside her and commenced taking in water.  While we were there a barge load of sheep was brought alongside for us to embark, the Commander of the trawler that towed them out did not have any idea what they were for, or why sent to us; so they were all put down one of the holds, and penned up in a corner.  The authorities seem to be making a general utility ship of us and dumping all sorts of undesirable things aboard.
