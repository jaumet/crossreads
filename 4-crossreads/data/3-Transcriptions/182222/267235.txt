<p><u>29 </u>Signalled instrs. from C. abt 11 am to get in fast as possible behind banks. no pilot. Red buoy. Skipper whacked her up to about 9 and whoosh! Kerbang!&nbsp; up she went on a beautiful bank &amp; stuck amidships with nose &amp; stern in deep water screwed at by opposite currents. The red bouy was a black one gone rusty &amp; we took the wrong side. Sundry craft have been trying to pull us off without success, included among these a weird steam tug on end of which a naked nig in a dirty hat operates a wheezy hand pump all the time. The other wreck about a mile</p>
