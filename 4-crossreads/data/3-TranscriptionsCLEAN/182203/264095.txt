very beautiful but could not get very near to see it well. There were about 4 Bishops, Canons etc  & great ceremony but most impressive. We then went to buy Gum-boots for France, so I'm quite ready to leave in the morning.Then we made our way to Fleming's Restaurant - we then realised how hungry we were - had a good dinner at 6. 30. p.m. Afterwards finished up with a Picture Show and we laughed until we ached. It was a very good show & some most interesting pictures. Then made tracks for Station & arrived in time to see 10.30. p.m. train go out. So had to wait until 11.10. p.m.  At once said we must have a drink, so got to a Cafe    & had Coffee. We got back to our Diggings nearly mid-night, sleep soundly & feel splendid this morning. Two of our party Bonnily & Munro have been sent to "Bagthorp", Nottingham, this morning, so we are all divided
