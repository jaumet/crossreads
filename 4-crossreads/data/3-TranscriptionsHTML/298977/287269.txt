<p>-2- 14th October 1916.</p>
<p>Glad you got some news of the boys through Corp Barker.  It's a lot better than letters isn't it.</p>
<p>Hope you are busy getting Xmas Billies ready, which reminds me that I'll soon have to start scattering Xmas Greetings about.</p>
<p>Nothing more to add.  Am expecting a mail in.  Your last was August 13th.</p>
<p>Hope all are well at home,</p>
<p>With love from<br/>Roy.</p>
