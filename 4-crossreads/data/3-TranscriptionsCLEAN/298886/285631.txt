 5.pm. Left our last position and the whole column marched across the hills to a palm grove near  HOD-EL-DEBABIS where we gave the horses a drink the poor beasts were perishing and the water here was particularly vile There was fortunately plenty of spare horse feed so the horses had a good feed at "Jacko's" expense there were about 1000 bags of grain which Jacko has left behind in his retreat. 
 8.30 pm 9.8.16 Moved out and made for Oghratina reaching here at 11 pm. Fed & watered and had a glorious sleep of 5 hours after one of the most eventual and red letter days of our life. 
 I served 7 months and 10 days on Gallipoli and I saw and experienced that place during its most critical period but this affair to day - well Gallipoli pales into insignificance. The horses were our principal concern. We had to remain so much more in the open and were so exposed and Jacko made the pace exceptionally hot to make up for his crushing defeat at Romani
