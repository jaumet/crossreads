 creature and until God alters his nature he will fight as occasion demands. Rather a neat quotation in this relation. "The self-sacrifice of the human individual is not a lovely thing. It is often a necessary and a noble thing; but no form or degree of suicide can be lovely." The Ethics of the Dust &ndash; Lubbock. 
 How strange it is for me, on this beautiful October evening 8 o'clock, to be sitting in a dug-out, on Gallipoli Peninsula, writing these sentences? Who would have, thirteen months ago, believed it to be within the regions of the possible? The bullets from the Turkish rifles, the shells from the British, and Turkish  shells  guns flying overhead. Strange. It is passing strange. The waters of the Gulf of Saros lap the shore some thirty yards from my feet, my residence is in part of the very land up which the Australians climbed on the 25th of April, an oil lamp, resting on my dressing case placed on a stretcher, gives me light. Away in the offing are two hospital ships, brilliantly illuminated with green along the  who  length of either side, save for the red cross interruption. Several war ships, black lines upon the water's surface, dot the sea here and there. From one of these,  now and then  oft times, a great beam of light is projected towards Gaba Tepe peninsula. Still the continuous crack of the rifles. Now and then the tick tacking of the machine gun, off &amp; on the whistle or the drone of a shell passing through the air to end with the explosion or the plop into the water. Wonderful. Truly wonderful.
