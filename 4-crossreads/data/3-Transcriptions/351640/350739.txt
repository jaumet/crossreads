<p>Lieut. Col. Nash replied as follows :&ndash;</p>
<p>Mr Director, Christian Brothers, Your senior Student who was so good as to read the address in such first class manner and scholars &ndash; To you I return my sincere thanks as an Australian and as an individual.</p>
<p>The parts which your Society of Teachers played in the war of 1870 and 1871 and in this great war, show that though your mission is essentially one of peace, yet when the defence of your country &ndash; the best garden of the world, Your fertile France &ndash; needs men to <strike>fight</strike> help, you have been prepared to exchange the teacher's gown for the soldier's uniform, wherein as results have proved, your members have upheld the <strike>fighting</strike> best traditions of the men of Gaul.

Long may you flourish!</p>
<p>Do you desire me to tell you why tens of thousands of khaki clad men have come from far away Australia, bound for Europe, stopped en route in Egypt?  "Yes!  Yes!"  Well!  Because the people of that far away outpost of the British Empire, from their Prime Minister to the humbler in the land, recognised, the moment that Germany threw down th gauntlet, that freedom's sacred cause was menaced by the mailed fist of</p>
