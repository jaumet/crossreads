Dear Ino,
your letter of 23 Dec reached me here a few days ago.
As you infer I did not spend a very strenuous Xmas. although it was no worse than others, we were a day or two out from Melbourne at the time.
I have had a couple of letters from mother also, since I have been in this camp. In my scribbles to her I have told about all there was to tell of the trip across the blue, which if they come to land you will read, so I won't recount them again. I am in No 2 platoon A. Co. which has the name of being the crack platoon of the Battallion as far as rifle exercises go. previous to coming to Mena we of the Reinf. had none of the new drill we should have had it at Broadmeadows but the heads apparently forgot all about us, so we did almost nothing except forget.
