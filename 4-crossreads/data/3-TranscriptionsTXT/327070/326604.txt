were standing out in it, - the address was cut very short & really amounted to an appeal to the men to be confirmed when they landed in Egypt & before they were sent to the front.
After Church parade went to Divine Service conducted by the Commander in the saloon, & as last Sunday, again enjoyed it very much. Jackson's "Te Deum" was specially good.
Saw the doctor afterwards & got some medicine, & for the rest of the day took things easy, not feeling equal to letter-writing. In the evening we ran into a rain squall which cooled the air considerably. After dinner a sing-song was held, passengers & troops joining in it. Went to bed early.
Ship's run to noon was 360 miles.
Monday 31 January 1916
A dull cloudy day with very frequent rain squalls, which, as we are only abt 5 south of the equator are to be expected. A fairly cool N breeze blowing but sea wonderfully smooth. Last night was struck with the rapidity with which daylight gave place to darkness: no sign of any twilight. Same thing tonight.
Feeling right again & out on parade as usual. Spent all spare time in getting mail ready.
Ship's run to noon was 363 miles.
