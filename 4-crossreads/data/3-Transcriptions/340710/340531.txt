<p><u>The Graves of Anzac</u><br/>14.12.17.<br/>On the shores of ancient Hellespont kissed by the ripples of the Aegean Sea they lie our honoured dead buried in soil which bore the name of Anzac for eight short months.  Neat little crosses mark the spot in that Moslem country where the first of our men paid the great price in the fight for the freedom of the Empire.  Here Leander met his death in bygone days for the love of a woman and here our men met theirs for just that same reason.<br/>Across the water the stately mount of Samothrace rises sheer out of the sea and stands as the lonely Sentinel over those little cemeteries, over which the noise of battle once rolled, silent now no doubt and perhaps the grass is growing over those little mounds set out</p>
