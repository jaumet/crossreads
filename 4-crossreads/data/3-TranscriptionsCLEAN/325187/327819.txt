 On Patrol I took my gun & shot 3 Widgeon 3 Jack Snipe 4 Quail 3 Plover and 1 snake-  With a game of poker or Bridge & a whisky before turning in life is very good at present, & not half as strenuous as it should be of course there are always possibilities of a scrap.  Great gambling going on among the men as there is no way for them to spend their money.  Hear that the German fleet is out No word of any Xmas Billies for the 1st L H who were at ANZAC the men feel rather disappointed.
