 'Tis the end, 'tis the end of our wearisome waiting,                                      And counting the days with a sigh of regret,                                                And thinking of those who are suffering in silence                                                 But Providence mocks us and Whispers "Not Yet" 
 And beyond, far beyond where the sunbeams are peeping                               Our comrades are calling we cannot forget,                                              And we look with a hope for a word to support them,                                    But Providence frowns and still Answers "Not Yet" 
 So we wait and we watch what the news has to tell us,
