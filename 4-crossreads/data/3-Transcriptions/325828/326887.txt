<p>me.  Mr Saxby's two sons, Eric &amp; Keith are also here in the first Ambulance, &amp; I had a yarn to the elder one on Sunday.<br/>If this should reach you &amp; my later one shouldn't, I would like to wish you very many Happy Returns of the Day for the 9th March.  It will probably reach you early, but we can't judge the mails to a Day here.  I hope it will be a Happy Birthday Mother Day, &amp; you can be sure I will be thinking of you an extra lot that day if I am alive.<br/>Must close now, With best love to yourself &amp; Father dear, &amp; also Anna.<br/>Your loving Leo<br/>P.S. You must please excuse the scrawl, but I am writing under peculiar position- sitting on a kit bag in the tent with a candle stuck on a lid of a jam tin for a candlestick.  This is suspended with 3 wires to the tent, &amp; to stop it from swaying about in the wind I have my old boot tied to the bottom of it.  Leo.</p>
