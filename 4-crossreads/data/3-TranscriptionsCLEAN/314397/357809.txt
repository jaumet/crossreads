  
 anywhere near the village. Didn't even see a picture on the walls. The church has been pulled to pieces inside. They had some Fritz working on a road in the village . The Major & Capt. Pattinson went out near the line to look at a job we have to do & after tea I took the NCO's out to have a look. We got a lorry from here to Vriely & then hoofed it across country. Not much doing 'cept a few shells exceptionally close. Got home before dark. 
 Gee we get good amusement at night time. Our search lights get the Fritz planes in their glow & all the guns near by go for their lives. They never hit them tho. Dropped a few bombs very close to us last night. 
 Thursday 15.8.18. The job is off so our walking tour was wasted. McGowan went on leave to Paris. Just as we finished our lunch Fritz started shelling the valley. Gee they were close too. We got two slightly wounded.
