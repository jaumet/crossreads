Saturday 12 October
Arrive in Glasgow at once start sight seeing. The Rouken Glen Botanic Gardens then University Art Gallery. Glasgow, in great contrast to Edinburgh, is a city of business, many people in the streets. There are signs of sedition here too, many seditious notices are chalked about the pavements.
Blythswood Hotel.
Sunday 13 October
A fine day but not clear. A visit to Loch Lomond, Balloch, but no steamers running.
No doubt, the lake is beautiful, but I was far from being moved when I saw it. Possibly expected too much. Balloch Park is very fine. A walk round Glasgow this evening in a crowd of people of which I have seen no equal.
