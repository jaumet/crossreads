<p>First day had to Report at Head Quarters   &amp;  then do shopping. While at Head Quarters me Myra Wyse whose wedding we wanted to be over for   &amp;  to our delight have been in time. She was so excited at meeting us, she   &amp;  her sister who is over from France for the event, spent the day together. We had lunch to-gether, shopped   &amp;  then dinner   &amp;  to see "Romance", it is an awfully pretty little play   &amp;  we thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Next day did more shopping   &amp;  fixed up Pay-book. From the 30th November I have made my allotment of 5/- per day, so you will be receiving double the amount after that date. I have plenty to go on with   &amp;  am sure can manage very well on the remaining amount.</p>
<p>Wednesday-night spent from 12 till 3 a.m. in the basement. Wretched Air-raid.</p>
