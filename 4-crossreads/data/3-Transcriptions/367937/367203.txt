<p>Ras-el-tin<br/>Alexandria</p>
<p>26th June, 1916</p>
<p>My dear Father,<br/>I intended to write this yesterday on your birthday but what between sleeping and waking I never had time.<br/>I came down here on Thursday and was put in mumps isolation and since then have been having a pretty good time; we get splendid tucker, have nothing to do and get leave from 2 till 7 every afternoon, and as Rostron is here and another nice chap named Nelson, a 3rd year Sydney W Medical student, we have a pretty good time going about together.<br/>The journey down from Cairo to Alexandria is a fair eye opener: you leave at 9.30 and dont get to Alexandria till after 1 PM and during the whole of that time you are passing through country like the flats just before you come into Mudgee only those flats are poor compared to some of this.<br/>Alexandria is a fair sized city and pretty clean too only the streets are terribly narrow; in some places the houses are built out about four stories up and you could jolly nearly jump across from one side to another.</p>
