Monday 15th NovTo-day it was showery and looked as if we were in for some heavy weather. Owing to bad sea the 3rd Brigade Infantry could not leave last evening for a spell at Lemnos. Went Y.M.C.A. Canteen for 7th Battery but found no supplies had come across. The Turkish Artillery opened up on all our positions and sent across a big lot of shells. On the beach a number of men were wounded. It rained heavy in the evening.
Tuesday 16th NovThe sea is still very angry looking. Yesterday while coming along to North Beach [just North of Anzac Cove] the scene was very fine although carrying destruction with it. The sea was lashed into spray on the beach & over the jetties etc.
The Gurkas here are a fine
