<p>good &amp; the weather is getting cooler but the flies are still bad.  On Saturday [9th] morning at 3 am our Brigade left camp &amp; marched to Ganddel [?] NE from our camp at Hassaniya.  We reached there shortly after daylight &amp; stayed there till 4 pm  My troop was on left flank guard  At dark we were joined by the 3rd Brigade &amp; the artillery (8 guns) &amp; we marched all night.  It was very tiresome having had no sleep for nearly 2 days.</p>
<p>We reached within 2 miles of the Turkish camp at daybreak  The 3rd Bgde went to the right &amp; we went straight on.  The Turks were well entrenched &amp; we should have been 2 miles further north.  As we were in the wrong place at daylight we had lost the element of surprise &amp; it was impossible for us to make a frontal attack.  We engaged them till noon (17th Sept) inflicting casualties &amp; taking 15 prisoners, our artillery shelling their trenches.  Our aviators were very daring &amp; did good work.  On the way back we found water for our horses &amp; selves  We had a spell &amp; boiled our billies at 3 pm</p>
