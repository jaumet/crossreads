Tuesday 21 August 1917
Went for a sail to "AGONY" island or those who are sea sick call it. One of the old Forts that were blown up by the bombardment.
I feel fitter but "short a gallop".
[The following paragraph crossed through.]I only hope you are not worrying about me. Pick up & leave for the Desert in the morning. Not much of interest in Diary to read out print them daily, but it is all of interest to you little Mother so I keep it going for your sake.
