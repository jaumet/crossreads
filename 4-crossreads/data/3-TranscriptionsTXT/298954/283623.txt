 Although Karlsruhe is mainly a distributing camp &amp; few remain longer than a few days at present when so many prisoners are coming from the Western front there are quite a number of old stagers here who are actually in receipt of Red Cross Parcels! 
 They usually invite some of the new arrivals to little feeds, the N.A's, of course, being expected earn their grub with amusing anecdotes and interesting small-talk.   Rundle has almost adopted me, &amp; teas &amp; suppers me regularly. 
 To again resume:- 
 "Dinner" (!) is at 6 p.m. &amp; is somewhat similar to lunch. 
 (For these two scanty meals &amp; our "accommodation" we are charged about 2 marks a day.   The British Govt. allow Mercantile Marine Captains &amp; C.O.'s. 100 marks monthly &amp; junior officers (including me) 60 marks for these expenses.)
