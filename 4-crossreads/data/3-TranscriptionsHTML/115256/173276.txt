<p>Sunday 17 January 1915</p>
<p>The usual old Sunday to-day.  Church parade as usual, and, for the rest of the day, sleep, more sleep, and then a little more sleep.  One of those days when you get quite an unaccountable and inexplicable fit of laziness and slackness over you.  You are conscious of a desire to do something, then, just as you are on the point of getting up to do it &ndash; well you don't.  You feel inclined for a game of deck quoits, you have made up a game &ndash; but ,just as you rise to start, someone says "Oh hang it all, I can't be bothered!"  Everybody heaves a grateful sigh of relief.  In the same instant, a game of auction bridge is suggested.  Everybody is agreeable, but when it comes to the question of going below for the cards and scorers &ndash; "nothing doing".  This strange phenomena is, to me, inexplicable.  We are conscious of the apparent laziness, and there is a weak incentive to combat it.  But our vital enegy is too slow &ndash; it cannot carry out that desire to act, to do something.  This tendency is very pronounced on board.  The heavy sea air is the explanation, I suppose.</p>
