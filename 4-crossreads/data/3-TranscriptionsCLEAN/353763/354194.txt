  
 The 'Admiral' seems to have had a most adventurous career  -  At present he is Harbor Master - a most useful man in these parts  -  He understands & can work niggers & is not afraid of hard work  -  I fancy he earns more than most but his difficulty is hanging on to it  - What a legion of good men there are in that particular company of frontiersmen  - Wednesday Sept 23rd Fresh morng  -  with the wind from the SE  -  The first thing was a row to the pier head & a glorious dive into the briny  -  A row back & breakfast Speaking about food - the thing is moderation in eating & particularly in drink  -  The men eat too much  -  Eat little & you feel you can do anything  -  Above all you avoid 11 am drinks & to my mind cocktails at any time  -  There is far too much drinking among the officers - rarely to excess I admit but all the same, nips do no good in these tropical parts  -  Sunrise to Sunset don't drink is my tip  -
