<p>Previously they had not put in much of an appearance due I take it to the desire to get acquainted with their new surroundings</p>
<p>As I said we were on the top deck and could see them promenading up and down the deck As is usual one began to make acquaintances and on and off these continued throughout the voyage</p>

<p>A church parade was held about this time to which we were all invited Dont know but think it was compulsory to go below deck</p>
