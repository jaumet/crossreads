 East of Amien . Incident of the August Battl . The Barrag and the Fog . Australian ? Splendid Part . ( By Napier ) In the Field , August 156 , 1918 Long will Australian rememb the 8th of August , 1918 , as the open phase of broad-front attack which swept the Hun out of mile of French countri north and south of the Somm . The night befor was pitch-dark . I had been marshal compani of an assault battalion on to a jumping-off tape line . At interv through the night the inki black was broken by brilliant German flare fire from post 200 to 400 yard away . But practic warrior know that to stand still when the flare is burn is to avert hostil fire . A few indiffer spirit kept move , and " Cr-r-r-k ! " would break a burst of machine-gun fire , happili without luck for the Hun gunner . Befor the appoint hour we were all in posit , await the signal that artilleri proclaim to Heaven and earth . The ground was sodden from recent rain ; heavi cloud obscur the star , and toward zero hour a dens fog swept over the landscap , shroud in tantalis gloom all object more than 10 yard away . Would it spoil the attack ? Even the brightest of German flare was but a feebl glow . Our Barrag Open . A few minut of tens wait . Men up all night , recumb in shell-hol , bit of trench , fold in the ground , are drowsi toward dawn . They know what is ahead of them , but we have been fortun in form up without casualti . The feel that one 's mate are roundabout strengthen mutual confid . They are all " Digger " , and shall be as undaunt at the end of this day as now , befor the grey light begin . The fog thicken . But this is a wide-front assault , and must go on . Straight out from the tape are the lair of the fore ; that is enough . " Crack ! " burst the machine-gun ? not one , but hundr ? and simultan , like a thunder-clap , roar the mighti volum of the barrag . One hundr yard in front is the curtain of shell-fir . Three deafen minut of near shell-burst , while scream overhead go the heavier calibr for counter-batteri work , and more distant target . Up go the Hun flare , but what avail ? The fog wrap them in invis , and the foe 's artilleri make but a feebl respons on his own initi . Our shell begin to fall more forward , creep over his outpost , bit of trench , machine-gun and sniper ? nest , and trench-mortar hole . Rumbl up through the gloom come on tank , suffici far behind the barrag to avoid damag from our own high explos . Forward Through Fog . And now is the turn of the infantri . With bayonet fix , eye and ear alert for the enemi , and a swing stride , these splendid Australian move forward . But the fog is denser than ever , the smoke shell fire by our own gun to screen the assault wave are as coal brought to Newcastl , and the thick is augment by the smoke of thousand of burst shell . Officer can but use their judgment , met get detach and lost . Tank lose their way in the gloom . It is daybreak , but the light is of littl use . Gradual and systemat the barrag creep ahead , regul to time-t of minut and distanc , but we can onli hear the crash of the burst shell . The first wave pounc upon a German post , and dispos of or take prison , those occup who had not fled . Enemi machine-gun spit venom into the fog , but it is random fire , and caus few casualti . Enemi high explos come scream over , but most are too short or too long . Anyway , the burst zone is limit , and our wave have mani gap . When a battalion of 250 Australian has to attack on a front of 1000 yard , form four separ line in depth along this front of 1000 yard , can there be other than gap which all the eloqu plead for reinforc has not yet avail to fill ? Direct the Tank . The light strengthen . Submiss Hun stream back toward our line , and the prison of war cage . Those attack who kept direct best find themselv a mere hand , attack German trench system . Half a dozen men and an offic captur 300 yard of Hun trench , kill some with bomb and bayonet , take other prison . The time for other assault troop to move up has arriv . Some get lost a few yard from the jumping-off line . Officer on the spot , of whatev battalion , collect the stray and go forward . One of these parti fell in with a tank total at sea . An offic with compass and map give the tank command his bear , swing him toward the object , and forward go tank and an ever-increas entourag of troop of four battalion . They mop up machine-gun nest , take more prison that the hand of pioneer , who first penetr the gloom , simpli could not deal with . They round up other prison by the score , give our own peopl direct , and clear the interven countri of enemi troop . With the strengthen light , the fog begin to dissip . Thank heaven , it had shield us in the critic hour of dawn , when German machine-gunn might have had a rich harvest , but now we are well forward , have penetr his defens zone , and we want light . It come . The mist roll away , and we find ourselv at our object . Dead Hun lie in trench and dug-out , live Hun be escort back , attest the issu of the battl . Straggler get their bear , and join their comrad to garrison the captur line . We sit down to rest a moment , examin our souvenir and trophi , then get to work to make the place habit . A Vast Cavalcad . But our part was but the "kick-off " of a mighti game . A vast migrat follow us , pass through our line to distant object . As far as the eye can see , are wave of men go across countri , north and south of us , while limber gun , armor car , hors suppli waggon and suppli tank , water and forag cart , now pour unceas along the eastward road . It would take the pen of a De Quincey , inspir with one of his opium dream , adequ to describ that
