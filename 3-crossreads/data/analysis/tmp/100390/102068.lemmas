 Away over the hill a machin gun is rattl away in it method madden song . Like someon test a noisi motor bike ; the intermitt pop of the infantri practic is echo from the pyramid . Sometim an 18 pounder boom over the sand hill follow by the queer sound of burst shrapnel like a big cart load of stone be dump on a road . In front of me sit a grey crow with a black hood two dingo like pariah dog with curl tail view me suspici . The sun glint on the silver anklet of a woman of the villag the sound of trumpet come down the breez . I shall be glad inde to take the warpath altho this is interest enough this train becom dead . I seldom go to Cairo now it too far , too cost . Howev the move must come some day . I must abid in patienc . How will it all end ! I often think , in fact I alway think of you far away and your quiet life . I think how strang it is that I would be elect the wander of the famili . It must be some ancestr reason that set me off on restless escapad . I sincer believ in my prophet sens . I felt this come month ago . Also I felt onc I shall return some day . Certain a wiser I hope not a sadder man . I feel about 28 altho I have now a fine sprinkl of grey in my hair . The life fascin me . I have never got your letter of which Viva adres me . She complain I do n't write ? I ve written pad of letter which must turn up some day . I had 4 1 paper from her . Tell her to be patient . I am not neglect but letter alway go astray in this game . Prap you may not hear in 3 month a line but word will come at last .
