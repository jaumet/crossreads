  
 dropped in for a cup of tea.  Poor kid he was having a bad time with a crook tooth he had.  I hope he has been able to get it fixed up before this. I am keeping in splendid health & strength & putting on weight.  Have a sort of witlow on right forefinger, but am treating it with caustic. Must close now, hoping this finds you all in the best of health, With much love to you all Your loving son Leo.
