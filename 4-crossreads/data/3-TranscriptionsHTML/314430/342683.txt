<p>Notice.<br/>The following pages contain a careful transcription of my diary while on active service abroad as a private in the Australian Imperial Force. My diary was kept in Pitman's Shorthand.</p>
<p>In the course of my trip from Australia to France, and during my Service with the British Army in the final and successful Campaign of the Great War, I amassed a variety of experiences, the nature of which I chronicled as regularly as circumstances would permit. In some few cases I have lapsed into longhand but with those exceptions, I have employed, as states above, the stenographic method of registration, always giving more attention to the fixing of substance, than to the forms of its expression. Therefore, in transcribing my notes, I have taken the liberty <strike>of</strike> occasionally to improve a sentence without in anyway disturbing the substance, which, at all times I endeavoured to embody (in the notes thereof) with as much accuracy as my powers of memory, observation and investigation would yield. To do this, particularly in France, was not an easy matter; to preserve the notes was a still more difficult task. Whenever the opportunity came I sent some of the notes to Australia, left a sheaf with friends in England, and before going into action I <strike>would</strike> used to lodge my papers etc with a Chaplain for safe keeping.<br/>Some of the entries in note book no 4, I have abbreviated, as they are merely descriptive of well-known ports between London and Sydney. The shorthand notes, and other miscellaneous matter, marked appendices, are forwarded to the Mitchell Library with this MS.</p>
