holds fine for this coming week for its the last week that Miss Allen & I will have together for she, her sister & mother are going to Blackpool for a month or so.
9th. It has been raining lightly all the morning but not heavy enough to stop us from going to Church which is only a stones throw from the Hospital.
After dinner I went into town & had a look at the performance in the Theatre Royal, it was given to the Soldiers, sailors, nurses & etc by the Birmingham Professions & Trades Fund, it was not bad I liked the music best for the orchestra was very large & good they gave a descriptive piece, "A hunting scene" & you could follow it with the music easily.
