<p>So the "Hotel" was disbanded, Captains, C.O's &amp;  C.E's moved into the Oldest Inhabitant's room, the Juniors moved into the room next door, &amp; the crew were put out on the main floor of the hold.   A new regulation is that no hammock may remain slung during the day.   Food continues poor, although the bread has improved (thanks to the "Wairuna's" flour.)</p>
<p>For breakfast we still have bread &amp; coffee (a little butter or jam is doled out occasionally), the midday meal is sometimes pea-soup (thick, vile-smelling stuff) and sometimes "Mrs Crippen" and dried potatoes.<br/>For supper we had "something to eat" on Tuesdays and Friday.</p>
<p>"Something" consisted usually of horse-sausage.</p>
<p>On Sundays we had quite a celebration usually soup, Mrs Crippen &amp; dried spuds, &amp; rice mixed with cinnamon.</p>
<p>At 3 pm on Sundays we usually got large quantities of excellent cocoa.</p>
