Collected my pay book from Horseferry Road it having been audited & found that I was overdrawn a few pounds & and that they had charged me 6/- for my fare from London to Folkstone last December when I took the ordinary leave pass-ticket.
Thursday 27th Feb.  Cold a little better went to dancing class at 11 and then to S.M. & Co. for mail and another fiver.  Arranged to have lunch with Mr. Thoroughgood & Brown the following Thursday.  Had lunch at the Aldwych & then went to the West End cinema chiefly to see a C.C. picture " Shoulder Arms" very funny.  Had a look over the Guild Hall as previously I had missed it, very little open to the public owing to the war.  Had dinner at Lyons in Coventry Street, a fashionable cheap place, having a good dinner for 3/5 with the music from a Jazz band thrown in, my first experience of one & judge it to be catching on for the new dances only.
