worst villages that we have ever been billeted in, the mud was inches thick on the roads. After dinner I took a stroll to Abbeville, a small French town about 8 kilos away, & spent a pleasant afternoon & evening there. Visited the Cooees Pierrott show & enjoyed the performance immensely. Luckily I did not walk home but, obtained a lift in one of our Ambulance cars.  At mid-night on the 27th inst. we started on the road again & marched to Pont Remy, the entraining point.  We arrived there at 3:30 a.m. & found to our dismay & of course as usual, that our military express had been delayed. Even other Units of our Brigade who were supposed to entrain hours before us were waiting also. You can guess that it was very cold at this hour of the morning;  but the "Diggers" soon had big fires going, along the street and the Frenchies fences & timber suffered. It was a long & miserable wait, the cold was intense & to make matters worse, it rained continuously. At 12 a.m. we actually boarded the train, in cattle trucks naturally;  but we were fairly warm, as thirty men were put in each truck. Once again we helped ourselves & collared straw for the floor of the truck. Needless to say - it was not very long before all were asleep and a very good sleep we had,
