  
 Oct. 15 On Poys. the planes dropped their bombs, quite unhindered by the eleven strong searchlights round the city. 
 Only for the fear they fought, the night effects, the tracer bullets, the searchlights, the star shrapnell flashes, and one lovely parachute light dropped, that fell slowly lighting all the city to the planes, the whole raid made loveliness unsurpassed, that meant hideous death and ruin about where the bombs fell. 
 Passing the Y.M.C.A. by the camp a strong singing of 'Lead Kindly Light' carried far down the roads.  No hymn can touch Newman for loveliness and popularity with the troops, and then singing of it is always a song to listen to. 
 Turning in reading Ransome's 'Bohemia in London', read three lovely little essays contained in it, "The Bookshop of Bohemia", "Some Newspapers and Magazines" and "Ways and Means".  The book worth all the carrying of its hard cover about Poperinghe, and worth the keeping.  Will pass it on to George. 
 55.  Oct. 15, 16 Underwood - 'Hunty' of Henencourt hears of his going shortly to Oxford to the O.T.C., and the morning offered the taking of my third journal to post in Blighty.  I think I'll keep it myself, though the carrying of it takes another book place. 
 Parcelled up 'City of Fear' and 'Pawns', addressed to Mr. Hadley, also 'Poems' to Mat. with the end of the years love.  Yet to be censored.  Later: censored by Phillips. 
 Turned in early - a raid in progress, and during it two Gothas above us in the light of 11 searchlights. 
 The night clear and star'd, the stiff searchlights rising from behind the darkly silhouetted huts... a lovely sight. 
 56.  October 16 Turned in last night reading "The Point of View" of Benson's, and finished it at breakfast...which has been quite a meal since we've been here"  Porridge, Bacon, and Bread and Jam. 
 A Route march, and back in huts read a while 'The Letters of a Soldier'.  They are all fine, and all well written.  It is a book for quiet thinking, [indecipherable], after.
