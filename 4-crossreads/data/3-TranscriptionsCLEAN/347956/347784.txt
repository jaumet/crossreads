down by th  arrainged by Mr Brooks (the ships officer attending the canteen) & the Colonel.  some articles had a decided drop in the line of foodstuffs (although beer is still 4d per pint)  chocolates for instance, dropped from 1d to 1/2 d each, so the strike was declared off.we are now level with the first squadron of ships that left Colombo (4 P.M.) another horse died to-day
Sat 21stWoke up at "reveille" this morning & was surprised to see that all the ships are at a standstill; I believe we lost two of our ships last night & had to wait for them to catch up again.  we have left the main fleet behind us & they are out of sight.  we are a flying squadron & travelling at 13 knots per hour, I believe we take fresh water
