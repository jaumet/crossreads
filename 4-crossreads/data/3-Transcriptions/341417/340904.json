<p>Somewhere in Flanders<br/>12/10/17.</p>
<p>Dear Miss King</p>
<p>Your ever welcome letter safely to hand and I was ever so pleased to hear from you again. I was pleased to know that the Souvenir of Anzac Day was a success in helping Miss G Owen in Recruiting and I was very proud to show your letter to my comrades. Well Miss King I am sending you some German Souvenirs this time and if they are of any assistance</p>
