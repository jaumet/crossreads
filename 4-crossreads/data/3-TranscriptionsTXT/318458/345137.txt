 helpless plight was further wounded by severe burns from back of his head all down his body.  To these he succumbed later in days.  Another shell came down the engine room ventilators, cut a water pipe, punctured two 3/16" partitions, gouged a course in the deck of 1st Lieut's cabin and through the ship's side, without bursting.  Another shot struck the armour hall aft and burst without perforating the armour.  A dent was made and one [indecipherable] driven in and across the bunker, making a dent on the oppos. side of the bunker.  Another grazed the [indecipherable] and another grazed a gun turret.  These were all received on the port side.  Two were rec. from the star. side, both of which punctured the deck forward and burst in the scanners mess deck and boys section doing damage to mess fittings but injuring no one personally.  The deck above the boy's mess deck was burst up and the shell folded back very neatly.  Several pieces of shell pierced the seamens mess deck hold and passed below to the stokers mess. 
 One of the first shots cut away the range finder, and took off the leg of the range finder operator.  He succumbed some after.  Another shot cut a funnel [indecipherable] but beyond the above no damage caused.
