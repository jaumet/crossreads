<p>Fri. Aug. 31.  Pay Day. drew 20 Fs.  Paid 15 to Billy Williams, that left me with 5.  I thought well this is not much use, so I played "nap" &amp; tried to swell it - &amp; lost it.  Now I'm stone &ndash; motherless broke, &amp; doing my best to kill time till next Pay day.  Received Letter from Ruth B.  Daunty &amp; Bluey went on leave.</p>
<p>Sat. Sept. 1.   Got Letter from "Oriss".  He has had a very rough time, but is marked for Blighty.  Lucky Beggar.  Bill Lancaster got marked P.B. &amp; is also in Blighty.</p>
<p>Sun. Sept. 2.  Fine sunny day.  Had Church Service in the Barn.  Wrote Letter No 32 to M.S.  After dinner went for walk to Roqueloire about 4 kilos away.  The Portugese troops are billeted there.  They wear a grey uniform, very similar to the Germans.  The village is very pretty, each house has its garden, &amp; the flowers &amp; fruit are looking well.  We arrived back in Camp about 9 pm.  It was almost as light as day as we turned into our blankets, owing to a very bright moon &amp; we quite expected to hear some Taubes over.  True enough they did arrive.  We could hear the whirr of their propellers, &amp; the explosion of their Bombs shook our poor old Barn.  Our A.A. Guns banged away at them &amp; for a time there was quite a fierce bombardment.  One of the A.A. nosecaps &amp; several pieces of shell dropped quite near our billet.  Of course Snowy &amp; Billgy May &amp; a few others had to go out &amp; gape at the shells bursting.</p>
