Well, we had another rush again but settled down to-night very quiet again.
One of our Medical Officers has been a patient for a few days   &  to-day poor fellow was sent away with Scarlet Fever. I'm very sorry because he was one of my pals   &  has been with this Unit from the first. It means 2 months or more   &  no doubt by then I shall be moved.
Such is life O.A.S. - the harried guns have begun again, so can look for another rush in a.m.
