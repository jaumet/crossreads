<p>get your "Christmas" box in a few days as the cases are here now &amp; only have to be sorted, so when I get yours &amp; the Maters I will have a few things to get through, will have a sort of a belated Xmas dinner, thank you very much dear for your thought of me, I am getting your letters &amp; papers regular now since I rejoined the Battalion. Your booklet of verses "Greetings from Australia" arrived in this mail too, the verses are very good, especially "Alex Barr's". I also received a letter from Dad give him my love &amp; tell him I am OK &amp; will have some surfing with him, as he wants me to do, next summer. "D.V."</p>
