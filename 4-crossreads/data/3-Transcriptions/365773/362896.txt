<p>[Pages 73-74 envelope]<br/>Hospital France 27 Aug. 17<br/>My dearest Sister,<br/>Again in Hospital - this time not wounded, not sick but injured - to cut out the trimmings I had my upper jaw fractured whilst playing football. My face is a picture a lovely black, bloodshoot eye, swollen face &amp; sore jaw.<br/>To-morrow I go to England &amp; when the face resumes its normal aspect will get leave again. It is worth while suffering a little to get the said leave.<br/>Well my dear excuse brevity this time - will write you when I get settled in "Blighty".<br/>Love to all<br/>From<br/>Ken</p>
