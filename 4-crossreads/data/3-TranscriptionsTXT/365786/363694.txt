There is a saying in Egypt that "this land is the gift of the Nile" & it is literally true.  For 15 5 to 20 miles on either bank of the Nile it is like a series of climbing gardens.  Egypt is a small region with the Mediterranean Sea on the North, the Arabian Desert & the Red Sea on the East & the Libyan Desert in the West.  The Southern Boundary is not marked by any natural features & has at all ages been liable to alteration.It is 640 miles long by 596 broad & its area is only 400,000 sq. miles, this is inclusive of deserts.  Below South of Cairo is called Upper Egypt while the city of Cairo & land to the North is called Lower Egypt.
