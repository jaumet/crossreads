We came back by an entirely different and much longer route at the back of the mountains which took us out near Groote Schuur (late Cecil Rhodes' estate) and from there by the same route that we returned from Urrizenberg in the morning. The circular trip covered 33 miles and cost only 1/-. We were back by 6.30. After tea I filled up my spare time making these notes. 
 The concert tonight was poorly attended most of the diggers preferring to walk about the streets. Until today the hotels were closed when the soldiers were ashore, but they were open for a few hours tonight &ndash; with the inevitable result &ndash; drunken soldiers &amp; sailers. Some of the soldiers were fraternising with the black population, which they were warned not to do. All the slavish and menial work is done by the blacks, such as coal lumping, road making etc. Some of the blacks have good jobs such as driving horses, mules and motor cars, etc.
