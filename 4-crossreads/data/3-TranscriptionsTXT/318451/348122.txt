Artillery activity has been livelier lately.  The Bosh replies pretty freely.  He exploded a big dump about 3/4 of a mile from here & the explosion was terrific scattering dust & shell casing for a great distance & occasionally he gets our guns, which is only to be expected.  The surprise is that he does not get many more than he does they are so thick & often only a thin camouflage covers a six inch Howitzer.  You imagine at other times you are approaching an ordinary Haystack when suddenly it sends out a deafening report.  It is a battery.The fields around Batterys that he has discovered are honeycomed with huge shell holes.  One I saw measured about 20 feet across & was 12 feet deep, a huge thing.  Houses tumble like a house of cards when one falls in it.
