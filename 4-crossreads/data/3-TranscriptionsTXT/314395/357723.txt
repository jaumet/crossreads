 I was very grateful to receive your wire of welcome at Albany, and also received another today just after I had wired you telling of our enforced stay. 
 While writing this I have received your letter and sincerely hope your proposed holiday eventuates.  Re that affair, I will have a talk to you when I get ashore, and we will come to some arrangement.  I will be on the lookout for you at Albury and will wire you when I am coming through which will probably be Tuesday.  Many thanks for putting Mr. Deane on my track, I will look for him.

 With my very best wishes Your affect. Son George.
