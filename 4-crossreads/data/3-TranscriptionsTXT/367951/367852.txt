 Dear Beat &amp; Family Just a line to let you know i am alright so far hoping you are all the same. We landed at Fremantle on the 29th and only had 2 hours off the boat and away again i would like to have run out to Perth but we had no time their was a lot went out but they all got left behind they will be classed as deserters. I was very lucky myself and my mates we got a few in in those 2 hours the boat was out in the stream so we got in a ferry boat and it took us over and we climbed up the side i expect when i am coming back i will not be wanting to stop any where. we have not seen land since we left fremantle we are expecting to get to our next stop on Wednesday morning.
