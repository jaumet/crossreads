<p>Sunday 28 October 1917<br/>Woke early &amp; feeling very ill &amp; coughing up large quantity thick phlegm.  Breakfast 7.45 a.m. then reported Matron 9 a.m.  No uniform so unable go on duty.  Matron observed my cough but lacked courage to tell her how ill I felt.  Shown over hosp. 11 a.m.  Lay down &amp; felt too ill for dinner but went down.  2 p.m. set out to send cable "Well &amp; address 27th G.H.", what a lie.  Unable to do more so took gharry (2/6) &amp; retired to bed after wandering aimlessly through gardens which seen later on will I think be a joy to me.  5 p.m. S. Daniells flew to ask my condition then arrived in company with Dr. Ritson (?) who took temp. &amp; sounded me thoroughly.  I fancy pleumonia [pneumonia ?] is their present suspicion, T. 103.4 P &amp; R?  Dr. is very English, kind as everyone is.  Matron looks in &amp; is charming, orders chest rubbed with oil &amp; covered with wool.  S. Moreton to come if I call, this I do not do but get very little sleep &amp; cough worrying.  Now I am admitted on the sick list, have a chart &amp; under doctor's orders for how long!  First day in Egypt!</p>
