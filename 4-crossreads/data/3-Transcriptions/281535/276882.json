<p>Marcinelle<br/>16/3/19<br/>Sunday. Did a little work and then met General Robertson in the Place. Yarned with for a while corrected some history and then dined at D.H.Q very well with the G. afterwards accompanying him to Thuinno where we saw horseracing and gambling. Great crowds bookmakers and canteens. A pleasant run back in the car and then had afternoon tea with the General before going to mess where Greenaway and Harrison entertained me with Weisbaden &amp; Rhine experiences. To the Varieties theatre and saw a very good representation of Faust. The filthy public urination here is disgusting. In the intervals out in the street long rows of women fouling the walls in all shaded places and men doing the same.</p>
