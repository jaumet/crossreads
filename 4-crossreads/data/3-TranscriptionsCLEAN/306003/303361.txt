22-5-16Mon 22ndI received orders late last night to go onto the Pinnicle to signal to troops on the desert.  Les had to go to a station above the water troughs;  We had breakfast at 4.30 & made to our posts at 5 AM & put in a very miserable day;  The Pinnacle is a high sand dome about 100 yards long on the top & about 4 feet
