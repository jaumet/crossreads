  
 the feeling that its only temporary & that I shall wake up shortly & find myself dashing off to a midwifery case in the middle of the night with my little black bag - these nightmares always recur.  Now tell me more about your book, I'm very interested really & hope that I shall have a copy sent me - what's it about?  Is it a problem that you have solved?  Or is it adventure? please tell me all about it. 
 I am posting you a photograph that I had taken when in London last, I am really awfully sorry  if  that you haven't got one before, I'm sure I ordered one to be sent you, I hope it will arrive safely & will help you not to forget me quite, for I fear that before we return we shall be very hazy memories in many peoples minds, either we shall be dim recollections or looming giants with habits quite different to what  will  we shall be expected to have either almost forgotten or glorified - its the latter that will be by far the most trying.
