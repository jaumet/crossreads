  
 Sunday 28 April Route march in morning. Watched socker match in  morning  afternoon between our team & that of the the erection balloon staff. Our chaps were all over them! Speculation in billet afterwards, on the composition of our team ---  mos  all English-Australian. In the evening a terrific bombardment started which seemed to be in the direction of Kemmel first but spread to the front opposite here - Meteren.
