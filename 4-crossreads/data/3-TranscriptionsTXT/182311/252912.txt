welcome after ten months enforced abstinence from theatres.
   Then when I was at Paddington arranging my berth for Plymouth I met Dick Crispe (Lieut.) of the 38th also on leave but two days after me, he was going to Taunton, Somerset to stay with a sporting vicar friend; we thereupon arranged to invade Scotland together and parted; we did not exchange addresses then which was rathre unfortunate, for on learning of my presence in the next county, the vicar was very anxious to send his car for me and add Harold Peters to his collection of "wild men from Australia."
   Dick Crispe and self joined forces later, attended the first house at a music-hall then travelled across and under London by Tube to King's Cross Station, where we embarked on the Great Northern for Scotland at 10-15 p.m., sleepers were impossible every one being booked weeks in advance, but I managed quite a good sleep in my corner seat awakening in Scotland and reaching Edinburgh about 9 a.m..  After breakfast out into the town in cold and drizzle, sight-seeing, first up to the castle, high on its crag and guard-ing the city, through its rooms, stored with the deeds of ill-fated Mary, glorious with the memories of valiant fighters ancient and modern, with quaint old cannon on its battle-mented walls.  Then back to the town for lunch, then more sightseeing in modern Edinburgh, and a night at the xxxxx theatre where I laughed over that screaming farce "When Knights were Bold." quite the best thing of its sort that I have seen.
