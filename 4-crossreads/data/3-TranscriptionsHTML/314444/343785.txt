<p>My dear Parents</p>
<p>Here I am again still in an ordinary old camp and no fresh news for you. I am sending you with this letter 4 rough prints of troops landing on Anzac Beach on April 25/1915.</p>
<p>I took the photo about 8 o'clock on the morning we landed and it shows just how we came ashore. The Pinnaces bring in a tow of about 4 boats and let them go when about 100 yards from the beach and then each boat has to be rowed in the rest of the way. Note the transport out at sea. Also the man huddled up on the beach. He was the first dead man we saw. One of the posts supporting the aerial of a wireless station can also be seen on the right of the picture and the man in the foreground are some of our signal section and Brigade H. Q. Staff. Don't get any enlargements or any more photos taken of these as I will send you some decent copies as soon as I get them and I will send the film too.</p>
<p>No other photos are ready yet, I am to get them on Monday. I received Dad's 29/11/15 letter a few days ago and will answer it next mail.</p>
<p>Good-bye for the present,<br/>from your loving son,<br/>Arthur</p>
<p>See letter in Sun of 27 4 16 about this picture which states 4th Battalion were landing</p>
