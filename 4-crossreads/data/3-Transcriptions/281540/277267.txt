<p>16/11/15<br/>Rough night.  Turned out at stand to in gumboots and then with telescope went up firing line. Reconnoitred from B8 but could not glean much beyond seeing that our shells have knocked over some of Abduls entanglements  Returned via Curnow who is rotten with septic.  From parade ground splendid view washed clean, Samothrace a deep blue. Suvla full of warships.  I have never seen the mainland of Turkey and Bulgaria stand out so plainly &ndash; the whole a study in blue.  A wintry Gippsland day</p>
<p>1500  Sunny &amp; bright aeroplane on usual daily round.  Some shells, shrapnel &amp; 75 at lunch time  [indecipherable] Long killed in "A" Co machine gun.  Box of gift stationary &amp; tobacco arrived.  Earth from tunnels is building up quite a parade ground near sigs. office, near Dressing station tunnel is well in &amp; flying fox has been erected to take spoils down valley.  How the scene has changed since we landed.  Precipitous slopes have been graded down, hillsides terraced scrub cut, chasms filled in.  Cooks are all neatly on terraces, mule carts running up &amp; down road where previously everything had to be conveyed on the backs of sweating men.  Round valley dumps extending covering graves &amp; crosses</p>
<p>21st QM fatigue man bushy beard &amp; rabbit skin coat, bare arms like cave dweller.  Sea very tranquil, 3 hospital ships in and great number of sweeps &amp; tugs getting close inshore for nights work.  Cruiser throwing shells inland with boom &amp; crash</p>
