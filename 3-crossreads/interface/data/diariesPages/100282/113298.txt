Imperial Government in practically everything but as regards punishments the Australian authorities refused to allow the death penalty to be inflicted on Australians without first getting the consent of our Government so this is one reason why A.W.L. is nearly always brought in, sometimes I think a little shooting would do no harm, as it would put a stop to the large number of desertions which are now taking place, in 9 cases out of 10 the guilty ones belong to the latest reinforcements. I don't know what it would be like if Conscription were passed its almost a certainty they would also bring the death penalty in, we would certainly want it, for there are a lot of rotters coming along now a few years in gaol is neither here nor there to them. The sentences today ranged from 8 months hard labour, to in Adams case "being reduced to the ranks (Sgt) in addition 10 years penal servitude, sounds stiff don't it, but he was found guilty of "desertion" being an NCO they made an example of him, I guess these sort of sentences will put the damper on a lot of them
