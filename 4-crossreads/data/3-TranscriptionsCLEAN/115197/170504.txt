 on a Sunny day.  It is when we love France best.  The sun is now bathing with its warm flood of light the early Spring flowers that grow wild in the wheat & corn fields and the vines that  grow on  creep over rustic village cottages. 
 The little white crosses that adorn the graves of our brave comrades seem bigger, brighter & bolder when skies are so blue and sun so golden.  To all & everything in France & Belgium, my parting blessing & my tears!
