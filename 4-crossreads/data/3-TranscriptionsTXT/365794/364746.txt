 Saturday 8 December 1917 Patients 40, wards very busy with dressings.  Robson, pt. with amp. of foot  for  (continuous irrigation for 10 days before amp.) is progressing favorably.  Riddell (brain hernia) operated upon, small counter incision near wound &ndash; satisfactory thus far, wound swabbed with absolute alch. Now for social life &ndash; 3 invitations for going out by "27" sisters, but refused as invited to "14".  Went for 4.30 tea with our own boys, showed my photos &amp; much admired especially Q'land views.  Such nice boys including D. Rutledge. We hear of air raid over London, big one &ndash; and the war does not progress I fear in spite of all the headlines in the papers.
