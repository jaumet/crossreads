<p>[Note added later]<br/>This is reply to my letter to Mr Trebeck &ndash; acquainting him that Genl. Burgess had answered my letter to him of 18 June /18</p>
<p>Dear Mr Garling<br/>Many thanks for yours of the 5th   I am as pleased as I know you are to have this information from Head Quarters.  I know Terence deserved fully all the good things said of him.  It should be a happy relief to your mind, that news you had, had not been lost sight of by those in Command in France.<br/>The weather is keeping very dry all over the state.  We are going to the station to night to see Charlie passing through he has been out West.<br/>With kindest regards<br/>I am yours truly<br/>P.C. Trebeck</p>
