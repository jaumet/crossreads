<p>daylight. Wrote some letters during the night alongside a heater as 'tis very cold.</p>
<p>Monday morning 8th Oct.  Bitterly cold. Very few patients coming in so my job is practically nil, the result being I spend all my time in the Cookhouse the warmest &amp; most comfortable place in the camp. I am also good friends with the Cook a very valuable asset. Walked into Poperinghe before going to bed yesterday. Before leaving for this place our Adjutant Major Close called me up to say a few words. He said I want to thank you for the good work you did during the stunt, it relieved us of a good deal of work &amp; worry etc. etc. &ndash; very gratifying as I had worked hard but did not think so much as to be noticeable. Before going in they had the wind up about the gas &amp;</p>
