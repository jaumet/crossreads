<p>into another tunnel thus completing the block.&nbsp; It was some eight</p>
<p>hours before those two big vehicles could be moved and by then the</p>
<p>stream of traffic was stopped head to tail for 16 miles, all the</p>
<p>way from Bapaume to Albert and probably further still.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Light railways soon forged ahead and within very few</p>
<p>days we were able to relieve a lot of the road traffic by this means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Germans&#39; quality of thoroughness was never better</p>
<p>revealed than in the campaign of destruction which he carried on</p>
<p>whilst retreating.&nbsp; Not a thing that would be of any use to us did</p>
<p>he leave in tact.&nbsp; That much he is entitled to do, but for the acts</p>
<p>of wanton vandalism perpetuated by him in the villages, there is no</p>
<p>excuse whatever.&nbsp; Memorials, statues, and such like things, always</p>

<p>every little</p>
<p>bridge and culvert blown up, not a fruit tree was left standing,</p>
<p>whilst he even cut down hundreds of ordinary trees about the</p>
<p>villages and along the roadsides for what reason we were at a loss</p>
<p>to know.&nbsp; Here and there he would leave some insulting remarks</p>
<p>chalked on a wall ending always with his idiotic phrase: &quot;Gott</p>
<p>Strafe England&quot;.&nbsp; He&#39;ll get all the strafe he wants before this</p>
<p>year is out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We didn&#39;t stay long about Bapaume, but pushed on</p>
<p>after the enemy began, this time acting in support to one of our</p>
<p>other Battalions which had located him burning off villages</p>
<p>some five miles further on.&nbsp; At the time of writing I fancy</p>
