<p>[Transcriber's note:  These are letters written by Henry Nicholls to his mother, father and brother George who lived at Manly.  His brother Ellis, who is with him, is mentioned in many of the letters.  During 1918 he is stationed at Bulford, England, visited Salisbury quite often where he had friends and also travelled to the Isle of Man, when on leave, to visit his Grandmother, Aunts and Uncles and other members of the family.  On 9 November 1918 he went to the hospital at Sanvic near Le Havre where he spent Christmas.]</p>

<p>Dear Mum,<br/>Your letters of 20th &amp; 28th October have just arrived to-day.  I intended writing on Sunday but I was on Duty till late &amp; did not get the chance &amp; all lights were out last night so to-nights the night.  I feel very much against writing many letters.  After all our trouble they get sunk on the way out, still we have to go on.  I write to Bess very often yet she does not seem to get many of them.  I sent a whole dose of photos for X'mas.  I heard that every one went down since.  I have 3 pairs of Khaki shorts.  Would like you to send 2 more pairs just the same.  I am sorry to hear of poor Bunny's death also of young Montgomery.  In England one hears of 5 &amp; 6 boys in a family all wiped out.  I heard of one chap who had 8 Brothers killed &amp; one sister a nurse killed.  The X'mas parcel has come &amp; gone except for a piece of the cake.  The cake was lovely.  You always or we always have luck with our cakes.  All ours are good when we receive them but dozens &amp; dozens that are sent are mildewed &amp; rotten when they arrive.  Ern Thomas has written to his Mother &amp; Reg MacLaughlan writes also.  I tell you that this mail going down is just awful.</p>
