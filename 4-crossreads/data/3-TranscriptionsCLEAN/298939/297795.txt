  
 Tuesday 10th June The letters to Rita of the last fortnight will, in them selves, serve as a diary, so there is no need to keep so closely to this We are still drilling hard & the general effect of this camp & surroundings on the men is depressing. It is not that there is not good scenery near, but the actual camp commands only a bare hill, & that naturally has a depressing effect.
