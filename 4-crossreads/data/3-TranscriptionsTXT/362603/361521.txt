4.  to know that Tom Porman is still well.  I suppose you know that this is the 3rd year now for us.  We've completed 2 years in the army.Last Sunday we had Young Wally Paterson, Reg, Close & Milton over to see us.  We had quite a good long yarn about old Times.  I went to see the "Merry Widow" played on Monday night.  It was very nice of course.  Gipsy Love is on for next week.Well, Mum, I will write to Dad & George within the course of a few days.  It isTime for me to go the rounds now & I'm pretty tired too.  I can lie in bed Tomorrow till 8 am. so there's one consolation in that & also to hear Ellis grumble when He has to turn out at 6.45 am.Best of Love to You all & Kind remembrances to those who are interested in us.  We are both well & feeling fitLoveHarry X
