26/9/15 The day continues glorious. Imbros and Samothrace look abodes of the blest their highest points shrouded in white fleecy clouds. The men ask leave in fire trench in evenings to go down to little parade ground and see the wonderful sunsets. Occasional bombing and sniping. They will probably give us a go tonight. Hope things are pretty warm and we all into clinches. Our men quite ready for them any minute. Aeroplanes circling about. Taubes have eagles painted on the wings. Flight Commander Sampson our man. Periscope rifles very accurate and used without slightest danger by snipers. Rifle grenades very handy for applying "move on". Trying to arrange for our sick returning to bring some tinned milk and other things to vary monotony of bully and biscuits. (N.B. Cond. M. label) Jack called in and spent afternoon, has been doing some good work with the bomb machine ? one blew a Turk right out of the trench up on to the parapet, not known how many they bagged in the trench. Abdul believes in taking extreme measures to get a definite result. One bomber very daring, promoted to Corporal for his work. Abdul waited two days and then at night secretly shifted machine gun directly opposite. They had to roll him onto the stretcher when taking him for burial
