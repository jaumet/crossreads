  
 4 Field Ambulance N.Z. & Aust. Division M.E.F. 
 My dear Rene If you get in touch with either Toby Nickson or Geo. Henderson, will you tell them not to rejoin but get back home. They must get themselves invalided out as they have done their bit and as I am not now in the Ambulance, I can't look after them.  I am acting as A.D.M.S. [Assistant Director of Medical Services] of the division but send your letters as to the other address I get them quicker. We are still slowly gaining and keeping what we get, but it's a slow business and I wish it were over & we off home. Love to B.C. & Will & the others & take a bit yourself. 
 Yr. affect. uncle Joseph L. Ruskin
