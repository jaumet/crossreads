  
 terrible hard luck we were unable to trap these Hun raiders in our meshes, and how they managed to escape was a miracle.  That the action was fought in great hurry is without doubt, as the enemy was anxious to make good their escape before our forces could intercept them - consequently no effort was made by the Hun to recue any of the crew of the sunken destroyers, - they even left the merchantmen whilst still sinking, and which allowed the British patrol craft, which arrived shortly afterwards, to rescue some thirty or so Norwegians, and others. Thus the Germans had once again disregarded the historic chivalry of the seas - Unfortunately the loss of life to the British Navy was 135 officers and men - The enemy raiders are said to have evaded our watching squadrons, during the long dark nights, both during the outward and homeward dash. Oct 20th  at 6 P.M. "Southampton" and "Birmingham" proceeded to sea.
