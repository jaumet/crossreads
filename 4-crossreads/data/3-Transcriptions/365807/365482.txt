<p>Dear father,</p>
<p>It is always with a feeling of shame that I read your long letters from home &amp; remember my feeble two pages in return. There is no excuse &amp; I make none.</p>
<p><strike>indecipherable</strike>  You sent me a list of letters you wrote in Jan. all of which I  <strike>indecipherable</strike>  have received except those of the 8th &amp; 14th . If they were addressed differently to the rest, it is quite possible that they are still chasing me from stage to stage of my journey    <strike>indecipherable</strike>  here. 'Here' by the way, is in Westminster, with a wonderful view over countless chimney pots to a ragged skyline</p>
<p>The general has been very kind. He wrote to some of his friends when I came over &amp; asked them to come &amp; see me. Mrs Edwardes, too    <strike>indecipherable</strike> is always sending visitors, &amp; as    <strike>some</strike>  I know a few people here    <strike>myelf</strike>  myself,</p>
