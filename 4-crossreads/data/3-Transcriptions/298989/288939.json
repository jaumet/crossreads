<p>7/1/16<br/>The water is covered with seagulls sitting on the waves as a hen sits on a nest. About 1100 an M.L.O came aboard and from his appearance (he looked a queer bird) was at once christened by all hands "the stork".</p>
<p>We entrain at 2030 tonight for Tel-el-Kebir a long journey that will take about 6 hours, but owing to the heavy canal dues it is better to go by train than to ship to Ismailia. After lunch we went alongside the quay on which were the usual gangs of filthy coolies. We passed a Greek ship with her name and national flag painted large upon her sides. Neutrals take no risks. Launches and tugs dashing round and even a real railway train is on view and some gharries plying for hire. The boat is taking a long time to tie up alongside and the bumboats with their wares are alround. Viewed from here Alexandria is a vista of blank walls and backyards, the quarter round the docks is the squalid portion of the city. The minarets of mosques can be picked up. In the centre of the city is that busy square where the Bourse and other fine modern buildings are.</p>
<p>At 1600 I went into the city and donned a Sam Browne belt and passing down the gangway the lads gave ahoy! Took a gharri at the entrance and noticed that nowadays they have British soldiers on guard in addition to the native constabulary. Rattled out over the cobblestones and swung into the street leading to the Square. Passed through a new departure since our last visit here to wit a miniature Wazir, the women (European) exhibiting their charms freely and pulling soldiers about. Some blue jackets drunk. Into the business streets and passed a group of vieled chattering women several enciente. Light rain</p>
