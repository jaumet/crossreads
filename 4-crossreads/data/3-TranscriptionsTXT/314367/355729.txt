A man - or rather lad - handed over by the Garrison Hospital to me refused his food & medicine & generally played up - He really belonged to the Una but I had kept him for treatment - I did this because I don't like any man to leave me unless quite sound - His disease had been contracted willfully & in addition he shammed some - Well the Navy doesn't stand that - It's a punishable thing to refuse food & treatment - even imprisonment is given - The trouble is that a sick man always has sympathizers - ignorant but sympathetic - However the officer of the day & I got things in hand & reported to Fitz - Fitz interviewed the blighter & then ordered his return to the Una - I took him over - The Una was not pleased - The man's record was rotten - He had only done half a day's work since he joined - Eventually they sent him up to the Garrison Hosp & asked them to keep him & discharge him to Sydney on the first chance -
