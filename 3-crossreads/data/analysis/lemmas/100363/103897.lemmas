 I was surpris at the magnific of the various railway station , and the magnific condit in which the perman way was upkept . Alight after the 25 minut run , one is immedi seiz upon by numer small boy , all anxious to act as guid to the sight , and the pester cabbi . These are onli to be got rid of by threaten , or one will be follow by a pack , cri me miser , me no father , no mother , no aunt , and end up at the end of their genealog tree , through sheer want of breath . From the hill on which Citta Vecchia is built , one look back over a great draught-board pattern expans of small hold here and there crisscross by fine well kept road . Citta Vecchia claim great antiqu , even as far back as 700 B.C. It is surround by formid stonework which have seen great histor happen ,
