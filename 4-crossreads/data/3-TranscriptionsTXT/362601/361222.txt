F.English lesson in morning. I read all day. We have Book-keeping in afternoon. I get the problem right but no one else. I read all day & night & go to bed early. All the plates slide down the table. It is impossible to enjoy a meal.

F.The boat gets a horrible list to port. I get pushed from pillar to post & do nothing all morning. Jack & I play cards on deck. I write all afternoon & night others read a little. Lights go out & boys sing. We have preserved ginger for Tea. We roll about a lot. Watch lovely sunset.
