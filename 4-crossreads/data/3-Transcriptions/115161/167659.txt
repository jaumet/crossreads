<p><u>BAILLEUL.</u></p>
<p>A fine large and flourishing town, almost on the border of France and Belgium.&nbsp; Streets - as is the case in most Belgian and French towns - cobbled, which is not by any means the most comfortable material to march on.&nbsp; Very fine buildings in this town, and as usual many houses where we are made&nbsp;most welcome by the fair damsels who do dwell therein.</p>
