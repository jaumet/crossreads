<p>The scurvy outbreak is getting very bad.   Between 20 and 30 of the worst cases are in the hospital but fully 50 &percnt; of the prisoners are suffering more or less from this disease.</p>
<p>The flesh of some of the patients is quite black and putrid in patches.   Many are quite helpless and are in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>Some fresh potatoes have arrived, but no other fresh food to speak of and the poor devils with scurvy continue to rot visibly.</p>
<p>Fri.  22nd Feb.<br/>50 Iron Crosses arrived &ndash; also a little fresh meat:-   the meat was much appreciated. (by those who got it, I, alas, am again on a tinned milk diet!)   Wiesmanski, in the next bed, got an Iron Cross &ndash; quite a touching little scene tonight when mein Herr Kommandant and suite blew into the hospital and presented it.   I was scowled at fiercely for grinning during the ceremony.</p>
