Baillieul.
Investiture with ribbons in the Field.
My Dear People,

   The occasion was the presentations of the decorations won in this division, by the General Officer commanding the Army, Sir Reginald Plummer.  The recipients, both officers and men travelled to the field in a motor waggon with forms for seats, but everyone else up to the rank of Major had to march the five miles  of roads over French cobbles, so it was well to be a recipient.  Four officers and ten N.C.O's and privates were to be decorated but Lieut.Fleighter had that morning left for "Blighty" and two lads were in hospital wounded in the raid of two nights before.  The ribbons on their carriers were arranged on a Union Jack cushion and presented by our dear old General Plumer - grey-headed - who, with great ease and no apparent effort held a monocle in his right eye.
   The deed for which the award was made was read loudly and clearly and the recipient stood proud and self-conscious, then the General pinned on the ribbon, shaking hands and murmuring some congratulatory remarks.
