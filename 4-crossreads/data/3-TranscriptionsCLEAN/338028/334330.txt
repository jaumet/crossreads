Tuesday 20th
Big mail in I got six letters, replied to them, Pay day consequently lot of gambling, hot day, about 11 pm we were all roused up to evacuate the camp, as an immense cyclone had wrecked Ishmallia and was approaching in this direction. I got my patients out of the hosp, and then install my things on the ground and scooted to join the others, but we waited for over an hour, but none came although the damage done at Ishmallia was very considerable.
Wednesday 21st JuneWe hear our horses are well and we will probably be going down for them at the end of the week. Whilst on reconnaissance to-day one of our aeroplanes failed to report back, and we are all warned to keep a sharp look out for it.
