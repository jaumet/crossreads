<p>4 September 1918 Wednesday<br/>Had mess at Div: Hd. Qts.  "Jericho Jane" fired a few <strike>wild</strike> shells over but we are living quite a peaceful life at present good news still comes through from France.  There are Bulbs here that send up strait stalks 6 inches in a single night, growing to a height of 2 to 3 feet then flowering into a white wax string of Bells- very pretty.  Jim Ayre has dug some up to send to Australia.<br/>Did I tell you BANANAS grow along the Wadi here &amp; maiden fern? with Snakes &amp; trout in the Water?</p>
