Round gully before lunch ? view from dressing station very good. 
Notice field artillery guns and transport SAA carts painted indefinite daubed colours in irregular patches and covered up with bushes to avoid discovery. 1505 our artillery including some new guns on hill opposite opened fire ? some venomous reports.
1545. First blood, Brooks "A" Co blown up ? dead. Shrapnel. 
During day and last night large flocks of large birds flew overhead southwards in long chains migrating from here as the winter is fast approaching. Today has been very cold and sharp, the sun though shining has little warmth in it. Perhaps the birds were ibses going to winter in Australia ? their strange call echoed through the night. Some sports in the trenches trying pot shots at them with their rifles. Apparently some thing doing on the left judging by the rifle fire there. Busy all evening on canteen work and early to bed
