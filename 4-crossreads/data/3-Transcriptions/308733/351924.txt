<p>[The first line appears to have been censored.  What can be read shows it is two words.  The first is Transport and the second looks like the name of a ship as the word is in inverted commas]<br/>Left Moascar on the [date censored] at midnight and journeyed to Alexandria in open trucks arriving there about 9 in the morning, went straight aboard the boat, three times have I been in Alexandria without actually seeing the city, no possible chance of getting leave to go up the town although we laid at the wharf for the best part of two days.</p>
<p>This is a rather smallish boat as Troopers go but better than some, this trip I have a berth very much appreciated knowing what I know of the Troop-decks, when we left the weather was a bit dirty and I had a bad time for a couple of days not feeling quite right yet boats never did agree with me, I am liable to feel off at any time should there be the least roll, it is rather a misfortune for me, most of the chaps have a really good time and are quite sorry when their trip is done. We think somewhere in France is our destination although nothing definite has been said to us.</p>
<p>We have had lectures on French conditions in the trenches and what to expect there such as various forms of gas etc and how to combat them.</p>
<p>Steamer has developed a bit of a roll and dont feel too good so will knock off</p>
