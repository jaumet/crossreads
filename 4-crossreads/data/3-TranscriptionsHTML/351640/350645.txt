<p>Thanks.  Now to answer it.</p>
<p>You had just received the letter posted by me at Aden.  Others from Colombo should have been with soon thereafter.  I shall write to Clarrie Bridge sending the envelope to the War Office, London, or rather to The Admiralty London.  It will be a nuisance for him to have had a visit from the lady Mosquito.  You may remember that I wrote in a former letter telling you that Malaria is transferred from one person to another by the female of the Anopheles variety of the mosquito family.</p>
<p>Keeping very well indeed just now.  If I can get to Maadi Camp I shall look up Harry Stokes and ask him if he knows Dot Paton.  Maadi is via Cairo, some fifteen or twenty miles from Mena House.  It would have been pleasant for you to have the Macdonalds in residence at Blackheath.  It was kind of them to ask you to stay.  Cramond is a pleasant summer residence, and for those who can afford the time and money no more desireable week end rendezvous ought to be desired.  Tab will be sure to make Dot comfortable in Sydney.  Does ironing after washing make your hands shakey?  The effect was not very apparent in your writing.</p>
<p>Please convey my regards and remembrances to the Paton family &amp; the Macdonald people.  In return for their good luck wishes, I desire for them health happiness and prosperity, may all the virtues that attend the good be double on them, and may good grow with them.<br/>I asked for permission to go to the Suez Canal during the fighting but it was not my fortune to be detailed for that area.  The canal is about 100 miles from Cairo.  I hope the Sunday paper will be sent on containing the paragraph about the Cinema picture.  You have not posted to me many papers.</p>
