<p>what would there have been between here and Bapaume &hellip;.</p>
<p>109<br/>One of the casualties passed by Cliff back at the chateau this morning &ndash; a tommy knocked by a bomb:  he"d been after wood and lifting a small beam piece pulled a string tied to it and a Boche bomb.  Directly I heard it I seemed to remember going exploring in a great palace, but in fear of a similar happening &ndash; explosive line attached to anything moved.</p>
<p>110   April 16<br/>It was the 5, 6, 7 Battery the Boche yesterday captured &ndash; and then in our rally we got them back.  Killed about 1200 and of necessity had to capture 600 prisoners.</p>
<p>The Boche"s counterattack was the worst move he"s yet taken:  it"s the first time we"ve been repulsed &ndash; and although we immediately got back all we"d lost, the boys swore that they"ll never again take prisoners.</p>
<p>111<br/>Brown"s squad here from Cliff"s post in the wood.  Davies" squad up at next post relieving Nick"s squad:  tomorrow Ern"s goes up to R.A.P., today he cooks &hellip;</p>
<p>112<br/>This morning fine and windy &ndash; went alone for a walk over hills near Hermies.  If only the sun was alive, and the wind dead &hellip; the grass as in summer &hellip;</p>
<p>113   April 17, '17<br/>A mail in tonight &ndash; one from Sister Weigall, one from Betty from Manly and one from Matt &hellip;  Matt"s long, ready and newsy as usual.</p>
<p>Today is the canal for water &ndash; to the A.D.S. for supplies for 2nd Batt. and so to bed.</p>
<p>The Boche &ndash; according to 2nd Boys, is massing before us on our R.  Tomorrow we move from here to new position.  Ern"s squad up all today building new dugout, and now tonight 4 more moving trees from road for Arab wagon to carry on.  Yesterday we"re back to Cliff"s past, record time in rain and darkness to get from transport book of Stacpoole"s - Street of the Flute Player.  Read 4 chapters and turned in.  Only one case through &ndash; a Capt. sick:  kept him against instr.</p>
<p>114<br/>Strange dream last night of Gerald, and my advice to him re planning against the Boche with example tales from Factory Corner plyings, and a packet of photographs he brought from Aussy to me of Rosalind.  R in strange unnatural garmentings.  Also he"d several boxes of chocolate for me that somehow or other I didn"t get.  Must answer his card by more than a "whizz bang".</p>
<p>115<br/>Weather today as the weather on this same date last year &ndash; cold &ndash; damnably cold, rainy and miserable.</p>
<p>116   April 19<br/>A clearer day than yesterday:  left old station relay in the valley and moved up to sunken road this side of Hermies.  Good dressing post.  Billy and self on dressing, running, and alternately gas guard &hellip;  Last night, after a dopey day turned in and alone in the dugout exploded a Hymn of Hate on the day, weather and the Boche.</p>
<p>117<br/>On Duty tonight first shift &ndash; 8 to midnight, last night on last &ndash; 4 till 8 a.m.  Six through then, and three during the day.  Finished this morning covering over mud outside, and this afternoon built up end wall of sandbags and on stretcher dugout.  Tonight a mail &ndash; which I"ll read when Billy and Lofty have P.O.Q"d.</p>
<p>Then &ndash; with the fire good &ndash; a comfortable seat and a decent home -  if the Boche fail to knock any of the boys in.</p>
<p>118   10 p.m.<br/>Billy and Lofty back for bed &ndash; and my letters read.  One from Dad &ndash; 4 pages Feb. 6, one from Grandma 4 pages Feb. 10, and two from the Mater, Dec. 20, 1 page and 4 pages Feb. 11.  Now I"m in debt as to letters all round.  Also amongst letters a paper &ndash; the Bulletin Feb. 15.</p>
<p>119<br/>This is the stint &ndash; that back at Becordal after, the last 7 weeks in, I had such a feeling that I"d be better out of it for a while &hellip;</p>
