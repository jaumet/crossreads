<p>Haven't heard of Bill since he was in hospital in Essex. Lyne is with his battalion. Alan Williams was through here a week ago. He had heard from you. He had been in Blighty since October, so has had a fair spin. Les McCallum, who was with Hilda at Evans', was slightly wounded. He is only a kid. His brother won an M.M. in our brigade. I wrote to Mrs Roddan some time since.</p>
<p>Sorry you didn't get my Xmas letter, 'cause it was a "sonnet" one. Daniels have a farm at Towrang, yes.</p>
<p>Glad you are able to get some good books. I read "The Iliad" also recently. Rather a good book by Ian Hay is "A Safety Match."</p>
<p>Your letter of 22nd also to hand. Billy Hughes is in his glory in London at the moment &ndash; repeating</p>
