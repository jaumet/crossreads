  
 giving their lives" I know it was in her mind at that moment. 
 The last night, Sunday at about 10 o'clock we stood on a bridge & watched them all pass to the station - some were singing - others whistling, a great many waved to us and called out "Good night.  Good-bye"   "And so they gave their lives"  
 Its after  lights out .  Sweet dreams. 
 21st  Twas the procession of the Sacred Carpet.  This morning I saw it again - Lucky aren't I?  The Hospital has been given over to No 14 & we are practically read to march on.  I can't say more - because that little word  Censor  comes before me.  So I must come to a full stop & with very much love to you all.
