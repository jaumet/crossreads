<p>En route to Lemnos<br/>Feb. 2nd 1919</p>
<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>The wicked sea we suffered on our voyage from Taranto to Malta evidently gave "The Mission" its sea legs for the voyage from Malta to Crete was a joy ride.</p>
<p>The Island Crete is really wonderful, better than Teneriffe, steep foot-hills rise bang up from the sea &amp; are surmounted by higher contours until ones eyes wander up amongst snow clad mountains with here &amp; there the outline lost in clouds.  A perfect place for a painting tour.  Unfortunately we dropped the hook in the evening and were under way next morning <strike>1st</strike> (this morning) at 11 <strike>10</strike> o'clock.  No time to sketch even had I felt that way &ndash; really I was content to look on as my idea is to save myself for Gallipoli, also a touch of malaria produced a not uncomfortable feeling of lassitude.</p>
<p>The 'Princess Ena' is making quite good weather of it &amp; the Skipper &amp; first Engineer keep a fatherly eye on me &amp; would if encouraged</p>
