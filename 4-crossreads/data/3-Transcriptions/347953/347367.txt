<p>13th April 1914. Left Alexandria at 7 P.M. after waiting all day. We departed for island of Lemnos to await further orders. En route we escaped by a hare's breath from being torpedoes. The Transport B12 containing British soldiers was only about 15 miles ahead of us when she was struck by a torpedo from an escaped Turkish torpedo boat, but she escaped with little damage.<br/>On the 25th April at 10 P.M. we were ordered to transfer to the Torpedo boats which took us to within 500 yds of the shores of Gallipoli.
