5/12/18 Cannes
as we went along lovely little glimpses of landlocked bays & little islands kept coming into view. Dined on the restaurant car with 3 French people – one a very corpulent & not overclean cure. Yarned again with the nurses until Marseilles where I changed trains and after a bit of rushing about at last got settled down in a carriage with an old French couple and officers of French Infantry and one of their Flying Corps. On all the trains here there are plenty of Americans. The journey homeall night was the usual tiring and fatiguing one. Had dinner in the dining car and an animated conversation with a very dainty little Parisienne who was sitting at the same table. Later she was in deep conversation with a Japanese officer – evidently her cicerone.
