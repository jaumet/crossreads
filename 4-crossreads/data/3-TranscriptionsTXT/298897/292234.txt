 Monday 20th 
 Tried to get a boat in order to see the No. 1 A.S.H. crowd but could not manage it so spent the afternoon on the Pier yarning.  I had a letter to deliver to their O.C. concerning my transfer.  It read thus &ndash; I am loathe to 'lose Pte Gissing unless 'tis very necessary so that until you are able to promote him to Staff Sergeant at once I cannot agree to a transfer being made.
