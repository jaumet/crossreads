Sunday 15 October 1916Dull in the morning, later clearing & giving place to a bright afternoon : quite a nip in the air all the time. Left Steenwoorde on bike about 9.30 & came through Cassel to Arneke, abt. 13 miles from the starting point. At Cassel called at my old billet & enjoyed a cup of tea & bread & butter about 12 o'c. After the pull up Cassel hill the going was good, over level roads through numerous villages in which the villagers were all in their Sunday best. Some of the churches were very old, one, I hear, dating back to 1116. Reached Arneke about 2 o'clock, coming the last few miles with Staff Capt. in his motor car. Quite a cold night.
