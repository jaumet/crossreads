March, 1915Monday 8Flowers blooming at present are [indecipherable] Geraniums, Bougainvillea everywhere, Sunflowers, Marigolds & Zinnias - At the Zoo I saw two of the boats brought from Damascus by the Turks to cross the Canal into Egypt, they were riddled by bullets & shells. We still wonder where we go. Terrible Dust storm today off the Desert, blinding & hot like a [indecipherable] shower. I hear that Tommy Redford should be arriving today & to be camped at Maedi. My hand is better but still swollen & sore.
