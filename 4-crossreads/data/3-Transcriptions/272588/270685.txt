<p>Wednesday 3 AprilWet to-day.<br/>A walk round to Remi Siding &amp; round the district. The view of Poperinge through the trees &amp; hop poles &amp; across the waving wheat fields is fine, exactly what I pictured of Flemish scenery. This is the third time I have been in this district &amp; I like it, in spite of its flatness &amp; occasional objectional smell caused by the manuring of the fields. Nothing doing on the Somme but we entrain for there soon.</p>
<p>Thursday 4 April<br/>Still wet &amp; cloudy.<br/>A walk round old haunts round Poperinghe.</p>
