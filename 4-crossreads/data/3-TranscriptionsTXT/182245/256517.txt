 2 TUESDAY 
 Raining in evening, but fine all day. 
 Grooming horses all morning and 
 fixing our harness in the afternoon. 
 I was on the court of inquiry on the 
 death of the horse of ours that had 
 its leg broken. We&nbsp;are having 
 good tucker in the kitchen of a farm 
 house near here &amp; its not too 
 bad.
