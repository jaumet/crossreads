<p>2.  I know how disappointed you would be if I missed a mail.<br/>The Y.W. here is rather nice though somewhat bare, and everybody seems very busy in her own way so that I have not had much opportunity of finding out anything yet.  Rid had to leave me just a few minutes after we got here last night about 9.30 and I shall not see him again till to-morrow when I am to tram up to the Hospital: he is very busy.  You see he is about 25 minutes tram ride away from here &amp; after having the two days leave necessary to get himself to Port Said &amp; me back he has to stick closely to work for a day or two.<br/>I am very well &amp; though a little fogged, just a little, am quite happy.  More later, much love dears<br/>Your loving daughter<br/>Olive</p>
