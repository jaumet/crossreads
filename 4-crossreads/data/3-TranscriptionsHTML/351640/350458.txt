<p>Good bye now my dears.  My best wishes that God's blessings and every happiness may be with each of you during the Christmas and New Year time and that every day of A.D. 1915 may be flowing over with good fortune for all, and that some day in Sunny New South Wales, we may arrive at a happy reunion all safe and sound and in such good fettle that we may talk pleasantly of the time that has passed while we were separated.</p>
<p>Please give to Maria Watt &amp; my other friends the Seasons greetings as also for A.D. 1915.</p>
<p>Heaps of love &amp; loads of kisses for Car, Joseph, &amp; Kitty from<br/>their loving &amp; affectionate Faree<br/>John B. Nash</p>
