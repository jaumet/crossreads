<p>18/5/17 Bouzincourt<br/>This billet is very comfortable for them and pleasant gardens replace the inevitable "fumier". Rode home via Senlis &ndash; not half as pretty a road. Senlis is a disappointing and dirty village whose inhabitants appear as undesirable as itself. Many prisoners at work on the roads hereabouts. Most of these villages look very pretty as they are compact &amp; down in the hollows surrounded by many lovely trees. For her austerity in winter, France, in Spring, makes full atonement. Bunning resumed duty today from hospital and Jackson came to light from the Officers Training Corps. Quite a large number at mess tonight. Take it alround our army telephones are wonderful. Conversation is clear, the outfit compact and wires can be run out anywhere. Not a little difficulty in finding suitable ground for the battalion to parade on owing to growing crops and cultivation. French allow people here to till soil &amp; forbid keeping shops.</p>
