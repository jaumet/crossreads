  
 To the Ocean. 
 Roll on, thou deep & dark blue Ocean - roll. ............ Thou glorious mirror where the Almighty's form Glasses itself in tempests;  in all time, - Calm or convulsed, in breeze or gale or storm, Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime Dark heaving - boundless, endless & sublime. The image of Eternity; the throne Of the Invisible.......... 
 Thou goest forth, dread, fathomless alone. 
 Lord Byron.
