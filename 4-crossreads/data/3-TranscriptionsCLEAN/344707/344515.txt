I say old sport, most of us are fearfully short of tobacco & matches - somehow[indecipherable] - could you persuade the Col to send along say 25 worth of tobacco (say Havelock) & say 1/2 a packet of matches per manWe are (the Regt) reduced down to about 300 now. ( Why cant we get some reinforcements. You don't know & none of you over there either) We also want envelopes & paper very badly. Will write you fully when I get [indecipherable] to post paper. When you write enclose envelope & paper for reply. I hear on good authority that during the Turkish bombardment yesterday the Colonel of 8th was wounded.
