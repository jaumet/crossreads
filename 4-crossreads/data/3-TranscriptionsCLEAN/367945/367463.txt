 Dear Brew I was very pleased to get a few words from you & to know there are still a few bricks of the old monument left. Thanks very much old boy for your kind offer & I certainly will give you a look up when I get out there. Well things are going fairly well with me the last few days I have been getting along on crutches & I'm feeling much fitter. I have to get another operation later on, one thing its only a minor one. The damned thing that did give me trouble was three abcesses
