A Methodist Chaplain gave the address. The advice was simple and very hearty. Pass the Cocos Island at 12 oâ€™clock today. It was near these islands that H.M.A.S. Sydney sank the German Raider "Emden".

These last few days have been exceedingly hot. There is a very sweaty smell about the troop deck. The lightest attire is being worn by the men. In spite of that fact still the perspiration comes pouring out of us.

The "flying Fish" about here seem to be much larger than the ones we previously have seen. On guard tonight. The nights are very cool and refreshing on deck. Down below where the troops sleep it is very, very hot.

Monday Dec 21st

When I was in these parts earlier in the year it was very cold. This time the weather is hot.
