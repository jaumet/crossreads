<p>Reading, 1915-1916-1917</p>
<p>1915<br/>On Transport A. 17, Port Lincoln<br/>1.  "The Quest of the Golden Girl" by Richard le Galliene, one of those rare books that leaves a flavour of fine romance and a delicate choice of subject.<br/>2.  "The Renaissance", Walter Pater.<br/>I sent this home in first parcel from Ghezireh &ndash; I"d read it several times and thought I"d not have opportunities again.<br/>3.  "Belgium"s Agony", Verhaeren, translated by M.T. Sadler.  This best I"ve read on the war.  I lent this to Sedj. and he lost it.<br/>4.  "When I was King", Henry Lawson<br/>"And I love the dear land where the waratah grows, and the wattle bough blooms on the Hill".</p>
<p>At Ghezireh till end of year little or nothing, with the exception of Keats, Rosetti and the "Red Cross Book".  I forgot, "Guy and Pauline" of Crompton McKenzie [Compton MacKenzie].  This is a tale of Guy"s first love and his living at the Romance house brought into "Sinister St.", Michal figures not at all.</p>
<p>1916<br/>No. 4 Aux. Hosp. Abbassiah, Jan.</p>
<p>1.  "The Passionate Elopement", Crompton McKenzie.<br/>I started this while in camp at Liverpool shortly after reading "Sinister St.".  It made more of an admirer than some of his writing.  It could be easily sub-titled &ndash; "A Romantick Fantasy".<br/>2.  "The Ordeal of Richard Feverel", George Meredith.<br/>I"ll read more of his directly I get hold of them.<br/>3.  Finished "Endymion" and read and re-read a lot of Keats.<br/>4.  "Under the Greenwood Tree", Hardy.  Nick brought this out to me but I didn"t have time to read it.<br/>7.  Also while there read "King Solomon"s Mines", "Maiwa"s Revenge" and "The Ghosts Kings" of Rider Haggard.</p>
<p>Back at Ghezireh<br/>1.  Fol. N. de Vere Stacpoole, "Goods"<br/>2.  "The Orloff Couple "  Maxim Ghorki [Maksim Gorky].<br/>Started at Ghezireh and finished on Braemar Castle.<br/>3.  "The Sphinx"s Secret", Frank Darby (and while at No. 4 Aux. his "Heart of a Child").  This is in its small way an apology and an explanation of Wilde.  One of leading characters is his wife, here distorted.<br/>4.  "Picture of Dorian Gray" and "Selections from the Prose of Oscar Wilde".<br/>5.  "The Path of Glory", Anatole France, not quite up to expectations but interesting.<br/>6.  "Wine, Women and Song", J.A. Symonds, a collection of translations from early Italian verse of a certain school.<br/>7.  "The Antagonist" and "Richard Furlong", Temple Thurston.<br/>8.  Both taken from the Soldiers Cap in Cairo while at Abbassia.  Read during trip across in Braemar Castle.<br/>9.  "The Picture of Dorian Gray" on Braemar Castle.</p>
<p>France, April, Camp Mosset, Marseille</p>
<p>1.  "The Return of the Native", Hardy.  The first of his I"ve read through.  This is a jolly fine piece of work, the changing picture of Eagdon [Egdon] Heath being particularly fine piece of prose and description.  The last book though strikes as being unnecessary.  To know that Clem became a travelling parson takes away from the grimness of the tragedy.<br/>2.  "St. Ives", R.L.S.  The first edition:  I pinched from T. Wilson &ndash; had been some days back lauding its praise and then I"d found he"d chucked it behind his bunk as read.  I enjoyed it as much as "The Passionate Elopement".  Keats, Browning at intervals.</p>
<p>May 1916<br/>1.  "The Passionate Crime", Temple Thurston.  More than equalled expectations.  To be read again.<br/>2.  "All the World Wondered", L. Merrick.  Hooray for 'Tricotrin" [?]<br/>3.  "Sally Bishop", Temple Thurston, started after getting half through Zola"s tedious "Drunk" [The Drunkard ?] &ndash; which I don"t suppose I"ll finish.  Sally Bishop more than up to expectations and similar in its way to Daudet.</p>
<p>June 1916<br/>1.  Keats &ndash; "Otho the Great", "Stephen" of Lamia<br/>2.  "Byeways", Hichens &ndash; about 3 out of 6 short yarns.<br/>3.  "Lighter side of School Life", Ian Hay.  Sister Weigall lent me this and I thoroughly enjoyed it &ndash; appreciation of Weigall herself added to.<br/>4.  First 3 numbers of Poetry Review - including Stephen Phillips "Harold".  Harold very ordinary short poems &ndash; especially "Eilleen" very fine.</p>
<p>[Beside June, Nos. 1-4 above.]  In hospital.</p>
