Besides the steps connect the top one with the bottom there is also an incline electric railway which conveys passengers each way for 1d.  We promenaded had tea promenaded again & the trained back arriving at M'Bro about 7.30pm.  Went to Confession & then came down to ship.  Plenty of rails here all day & the men worked till dark at 8.30pm.  Saturday 14th August 1915.   Did not awaken until 7am, so was too late to go to Mass.  Had a P.C. from Fr Davidson wishing me his blessing & asking me to write when I arrive home.  Witt & self spent morning soldering
