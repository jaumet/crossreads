Aerial reconnaissances report large bodies in several places, so we got every available man out.  At daylight on the 20th our advanced bodies exchanged shots.  Our aeroplanes were very active &amp; dropped several bombs.  In the afternoon A squadron supported by B made a demonstration in front of the Turks.  We were supported by artillery.  A Squadron had 1 man wounded.  The Turks we found in large force &amp; we withdrew &amp; got back to El Maleh about 3 am.  We put in all next day in camp resting as we were very tired.
