just man & will do what he can for you. At times he goes rather wild, but keep away from him then & you will be OK. The boat herself is a good ship but is like a submarine in rough weather. You will have officer's privileges & if you do not abuse them you will not be bothered by anyone. Of course you may have to put up with hardships at times as I presume you are aware of the risks you take in wartime. There is Pinto the cabin boy to do anything you want & anything I can do for you at any time I will do it. I thanked him for his frankness & assured him that I would do my best & should I tread on dangerous ground I would be pleased to be warned. From then onwards we became the best of friends. He then talked about his life on board & I thought what a cosy little cabin it would be. On the bulkhead & on the table were the instruments of two wireless stations & never being familiar with a complete commercial station I was very eager to take a watch at the instruments, but Mr Sharples (henceforth Teddy) assured me not to be over anxious, as I would get all I wanted later on. Teddy was an Englishman, with always a faint smile on his face. He came from Wigan in Lancashire.
