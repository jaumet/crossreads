one is going to cop out.
I have just finished an extra heavy list tonight of Dental parades.
14th. I had an astonishing big parade for Dental this morning this was on account of yesterdays disturbance there was also a big Orderly Room for one thing another I was an unwilling witness on a lot of the cases, though my evidence got a lot dismissed so that was not so bad. This dentist has got the wind up me each time I go down he says after looking at my teeth, "right oh Sgt. I won't touch you today, its too big a job just at present," so thats sounds promising.
15th. Very hot again today, but one can notice that the evenings are getting much more chilly nippy that's how I like them
