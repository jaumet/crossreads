<p>approaching steamer. They of course kept a continual watch by radio day &amp; night. At night they were invisible as they show no lights, &amp; the only sign of their presence was an occasional flash from their morse lamps. Captain Jackson was very nervous with the close proximity of the transports &amp; certainly, at times the Saldanha would slow down without any warning &amp; the A13 would have to swerve sharply out of line, which resulted in a caution from the warships &amp; also caused the rear transports to swerve out too. A special "revolution table" was compiled on each transports for the following purposes. At night, the only means of ascertaining the distance of say the A13 from the preceding transport is by "taking a sight" with a sextant. At the mainmast &amp; directly over the stern (at a certain angle to the surface of the sea) are two white lights &amp; these are for taking sights.</p>
<p>By this means it is possible to tell the exact distance from the next transport (or any other for that matter). To keep the required distance may require an additional revolution of the propeller per minute to maintain the position, so the necessity of the revolution table which was used for that purpose. It may seem absurd but one half a revolution too many (per minute) will bring the transports abreast of each other in an hour or two hence the necessity of a</p>
