 to Damn our rest day in this Countri . and you watch , befor this war is over , the old parti who made all these rotten rule and Reg , and misnam them Disciplin will get a Shock . There ll be such a flare up . that the Head will open their eye . The first seed have been sown . You saw what a mob could be like when rous at home , we have seen it again at wareham last year , and again not far from here this Year . There will certain be more . Now I will have to ring off . When you go over to Goonig give them all my Love , and wish them heap of good Luck for 1918 from me . Tell them Im Still O.K. and hope to get back someday . Love and best wish to all at Home and just tell them not to worri too much . best of Luck from your Affec Bro Chas Have never bump up against ani of the old Maroubra mob . Spose you know that Ted Mackensen is a Loot in the first Bn . Now . I believ he is away in Blighti just at Present at one of the train Depot .
