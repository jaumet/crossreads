Pioneers came up in a body and said they thought after the "dreadful job they had just done" (burying and handling stray limbs & corpses all decaying) they should get a "little stimulant". Told them to go to h - . as they would have to get used to that kind of work, but later relented and sent down an extra ration of rum for them. A quiet night. 
  12/10/15   Sunday up & stood to arms 4.30 - 5. very cold; very busy with returns and correspondence till 1830 and then back to bed and slept till 2030. Shaved, and breakfast on "porridge made of ground biscuits" and a little steak bought from a sailor who stole it from the ships larder. Mitchell an excellent batman who can forage round beach and picks up everything that is going & asks no questions. A pillow materialised yesterday, and when asked he said "Oh someone mislaid it sir".  Spent morning in trenches inspecting sat up on step and yarned with men who like the life, and stayed about half an hour cracking jokes etc. All very merry with bullets flying rounds - there are some "wags" about. Some of their letters to home very amusing - notice them when censoring  One man described terrific battle (nonexistent) how battalion charged and Turks fled his mates on either side dropped, one shot through kidneys
