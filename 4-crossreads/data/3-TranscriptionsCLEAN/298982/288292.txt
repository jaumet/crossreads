  
 QM fatigue Sadlier gave me a fine tot of rum on coming off & I got Kenyons rag out real well. 
 Saw Hudson in the morning on way back Slept all morn with Butch in a dug out at hill base 
 A silly fatigue at noon which I passively resisted Cleaning the gully of tins. Into the trenches again at 4 pm. Self firing line at old loop hole same place I had near shave at former night. Letters from Tassy KMW & KW
