14/2/16.
Detrained at Zeitoum and marched to Aerodrome Camp; Heliopolos..arriving there at daylight. We go into billets in big sheds made of wicker mats, they are very cool but hardly waterproof. The tucker is all wrong we have received none today, through some regulation that will not grant us any till we have been here 24 hours. Fortunately we are able to get plenty in the town nearby. We were attached to the strength of the First Training Battalion; and the Colonel inspected us. Went right down town this evening and had a good spread at a restaurant had a look round with some more of the fellows. I think I shall enjoy living here for a while. Met a couple of chaps I know already.
