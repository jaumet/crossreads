 [Thursday 9 November 1916] 
 We steered away down past the Straits &amp; are now heading back, a beautiful, warm sunny day, &amp; good to be alive, I am posting letters from  Gibraltar  to  Dolly &amp; Laura  England but no advantage to Australia, so keep my Diary- I am very fit &amp; quite ready for the job again- If I get invalided again I am going home to Australia-  Dorothy is quite ready for the Bush &amp; I'm a little Homesick to see you all at Bronte  after Africa I settled down to hardwork &amp; the Bush so should be glad to do so again- but the war is not over yet of course  if I were offered a good military job I might take it.
