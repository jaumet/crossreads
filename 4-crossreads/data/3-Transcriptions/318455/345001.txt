<p>[Transcriber's note:<br/>Summary of content:<br/>This diary covers the period from 1 April 1918 to 12 November 1918. It includes Charles Hargreaves' departure from La Clytte, Belgium, for the Somme on 6 April 1918, the effects of shelling at Amiens, experiences in camp at Sylvestre Cappel in northern France and in reinforcement camp near Peronne before departing for furlough in Australia, travelling by rail across Italy and embarking at Suez on board the Port Sydney on 22 October 1918.</p>
<p>In particular, Hargreaves mentions:<br/>General Foch's counter-offensive on the Marne in July 1918 (page 20).<br/>A "new R.AF stunt" when an English fighter plane attacked a German bomber (pages 34 to 35).<br/>Reports of atrocities as the German army retreated in September 1918 (pages 34 to 36).<br/>The various "Furphies" or rumours circulating on board ship in Taranto Harbour waiting to set sail for Egypt, including rumours of peace talks (October 8 1918; pages 48 to 49).<br/>Complaints about rations on board ship while officers continued to dine well, drawing a connection to the conscription issue (pages 51-52).<br/>News of Germany agreeing to evacuate Belgium &amp; France before discussing peace (14 October 1918; page 54).<br/>Hargreaves' emotion when watching a newsreel about the welcome received by wounded troops returning to Australia (pages 57 to 58).<br/>News that the German army had evacuated Lille and Ostend (19 October 1918; page 58).</p>
<p>The diary ends on 12 November 1918, with the ship four days out of Fremantle and news that Germany had surrendered and agreed to the Allies' armistice terms.</p>
<p>April 1/18<br/>Two years today since we <strike>reached Mar</strike> landed in Marsalles &amp; if anyone had told us then that the war would still be as desperate as ever we should have laughed at the possibility &amp; yet the Germans are making their greatest effort &amp; have regained all the ground they lost in the Somme Fighting of 1916-7</p>
<p>We are still up near Ypres which is quite quiet after last years Autumn Fighting though I expect we are pretty sure to go south soon to relieve some <strike>of the</strike> Division down there.</p>
<p>One effect of the German Advance  has been to stop all the 'peace-grousing'</p>
