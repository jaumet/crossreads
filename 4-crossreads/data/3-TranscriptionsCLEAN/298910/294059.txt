 Dull day - A couple of our men suffering from  nerves  & insomnia - so had to go & relieve them at Foray House - Very busy during the night - had some bad cases - The Boys gave Fritz particular - Made some complaints about some inconveniences we had to put up with. Have been promised they will be rectified & the wounded will benefit accordingly.

 Raining - Mud & slush everywhere - Back again at Convent Avenue. Fritz putting over a lot of big stuff to no advantage - one dud dangerously near our 6 x 8 - made it rock some. 
 The Boys made a mess of "Fritz's" parapet with the pudding bombs - One call at night.
