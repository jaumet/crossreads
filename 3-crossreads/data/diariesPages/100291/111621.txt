June Thursday 14 1917
Busy night. Patients need a lot of attention. Have one ward surgical other medical. Former takes up all our time. They are all chest wounds in almost all cases pneumonia follows as in a sequence. Medhurst, Pittams, Skinner Williams all very bad. 
Rather like work of attending tho tis very constant. Sister Wood a good sister considerate.
