Friday 19 February 1915
Left camp early this morning to take part in a divisional field exercises.  Marching through Heliopolis, we reached the point where the road led into the desert.  For the first six miles or so, the going was quite easy.  After that we had to assume a new formation as we were under imaginary long range artillery fire.  That meant spreading out to either flank, with a result that we had to traverse, at a high rate of speed, a stony, sandy tract of very difficult country.  A great many dropped out as the pace was too hot, the usual "nail-in-their-boots" shirkers being later reprimanded by the divisional commander.  This fast tramp lasted for about one hour, and at the end of the stretch we were complimented by no lesser personage than General Birdwood himself.  After a rest, the 13th was formed into the reserves, and we were just getting our chance to breast the top of a hill and reinforce another battalion already "in action" when the "Rally" was sounded.  Forming up again into close order, we commenced our long walk of 121/2 miles back to camp at 4.10 p.m.  Reached camp long after dark, thoroughly tired after what has been (so far mark you!) our most strenuous day.
