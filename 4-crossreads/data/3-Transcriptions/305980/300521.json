<p>April</p>
<p>3:  Sgt. Weir died of smallpox.  Wagon supplied to convey body to the cemetery, as a hearse could not be obtained, though gun carriages were easily procurable.  Funeral a disgrace to those responsible as the grave was only three feet deep &amp; we had to put the body aside whilst we dug the grave again.  Human bones were scattered about the cemetery &amp; the whole affair was scandalous.</p>
