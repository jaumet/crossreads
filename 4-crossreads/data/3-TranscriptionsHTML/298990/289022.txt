<p>Etaples</p>
<p>20/9/16 Stayed in bunk until late and after breakfast hung round in the mess "bored stiff".  During morning received orders to be ready to leave for the trenches at 3 am tomorrow morning. After lunch drew new clothes and equipment from the Quartermaster without any of the usual vexatious hesitation and red tape that as a rule accompanies any ordnance transactions and idled round all the afternoon. Went to bed about 10 arranging to be called by the corporal of the guard at 2.45 am.  Various homeless officers blew in during the night drifting in and out again in search of somewhere to sleep.</p>
<p>21/9/16 Wakened by guard at 2.45 and after a wash had some breakfast in the mess.  During the cold candle lit repast  Elmige and Davis strolled in. Still dark when I took over draft of 336 men with only one other officer and marched them to the station. Arrived there our trouble commenced and there was a rush on the office of the RSO to get the necessary papers in which I came off second best in a verbal interchange with an Imperial Major.  Found the train waiting and then ensued a nightmare of an entrainment.  Insufficient accomodation ill trained men, and bungling and finally 100 men were left standing on the platform and every coach was apparently full. The RSO was by turns roaring raving &amp; entreating &amp; we packed the men in on top of others and eventually the train started off leaving a little bunch of others &amp; myself standing on the platform.  I swung on a footboard and the others did the same.  A cold dark journey to Boulogne with its Napoleon looking out towards England and then to Calais coasting the sea.  The country now became waterlogged and marshy and a sampan shaped boat appeared part of each household.  St Omer with its ancient ruined abbey was passed and we struck through pleasant country to Hazebrouck.  Dropped some of the men at intermediate stations and crossed the border into Belgium , the only view of the crossing being a station with Douane on it.</p>
