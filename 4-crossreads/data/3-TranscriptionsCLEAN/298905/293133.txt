  
 party I don't know where we have to go perhaps the firing line. I am doing a bit of letter writing to-day I don't care much about the job but it has to be done all the same. Some empty shell case's dropped from the clouds quite close to our billets this morning, our chaps were shelling a German plane which was up early doing a bit of scouting. What a difference there is between these French people who are selling things to us & the Gyppos, they never want the money first like the Gyppos, but will put their basket down & you can select the articles you want & pay after, they trust us & we give them a fair & square deal. The weather is very dull & cloudy & it looks like rain this afternoon.
