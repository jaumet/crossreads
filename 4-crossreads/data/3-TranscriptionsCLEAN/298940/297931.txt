Have heard no news of Kollosche or Dickson & Stafford, & received no letters from the unit.
Monday 1st April 1918Yesterday - Easter Sunday - we had a church parade in the morning and in the afternoon I volunteered for a job which was done in five minutes, & so had a slack afternoon.This morning I turned up at the boxing ring and did some club exercises & swinging, after which the Sergeant instructor - one, Mick Walsh - gave me some hints on how to defend against a straight left.
