  
 good too.  Arrived at Fremantle at 7.30 P.M. men went ashore this morning, then there was general leave from 2.P.M. Went to Perth where the city tendered us a welcome at the town hall gave us a "bun struggle"; the freedom of the City and generally did us grand. Genuine people here, for this is dear old "Aussie"; and everyone is satisfied with our royal welcome home. 15/5/18. Sailed from Fremantle at 7.30 A.M. the H.M.H.S. Kanowna sailed just after us. A bit of a head sea. Passed Leewin light at 7.P.M. 20/5/18. Experienced splendid weather all the way across the Australian Bight. Light winds, smooth sea. Have been going slowly, but we are making better speed now. Sighted land again this evening.
