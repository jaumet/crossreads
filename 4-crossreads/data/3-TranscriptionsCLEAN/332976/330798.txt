There are now three "duck walk" tracks down to the supports from Gillemont Road & all the way down the consolidation of the ground is very conspicuous.  Barb wire entanglements have been constructed & the old trenches have been  repaired & put in a state of defence.  Rose Trench is being strengthened & the deep dugouts are being made larger, & it is quite evident that we are adopting strong defensive measures in antisipation of a surprise attack from Fritz.  It has been rumoured that Fritz has destroyed the waterworks at Bapaume.
