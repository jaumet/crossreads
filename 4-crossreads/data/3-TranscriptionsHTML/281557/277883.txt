<p>we were improving the support trench during the day: after dinner they sent over some "coal boxes" &amp; shrapnel: there were no dugouts handy so we had to crouch close to the parapet &amp; the pellets fell within a yard of us: too close to be pleasant: knocked of 2 pm &amp; came home: tea: packed up ready to move off to the trenches: Alf was off with a bad back but is a bit better tonight: fell in about 8pm &amp; moved off in the rain: we took the emergency road &amp; it was awful half way to our knees in mud all the way &amp; stumbling into shell holes: we were mud from the knees down: got to our old position at last &amp; took over:</p>
<p>Thursday April 20th <br/>in the trenches: patchy day raining on &amp; off &amp; cold: plenty of work &amp; little shuteye: they dugouts were dripping from the roof &amp; very wet. I worked my knut &amp; got a dozen dry sand bags: our artillery gave them a good peppering in the afternoon &amp; our machine guns made one of their aeroplanes hop along: I was issued last night with a nice pair of mittens &amp; they had a nice little note in them from J B Jennings, Bath House, West Hatch, Taunton, Som, &amp; I wrote a nice reply:</p>
<p>Friday april 21st Good Friday<br/>in the trenches: patchy day: raining again towards dusk: plenty of aeros about today: one of ours chased two taubes &amp; banged away at them with a machine gun &amp; they bolted over their own lines: Fritz gave us a rough time after dinner with his "coal boxes" &amp; they were very close. I was on fatigue 6 am-2pm &amp; was just starting to get some shut-eye when they came over &amp; my dugout used to tremble: one landed 20 yards away &amp; the dirt came right into my humble home: our artillery then gave them a nice little dose &amp; a bit extra: this is a game of follow the leader</p>
