  
 Tuesday 28 May All day to-day Fritz has been shelling the back areas with H.E. & Shrapnell & some fell in the vicinity of our billet.  Across the fields a shell fell into the Q.M. Store of 3rd nucleus Battn. & caused five casualties. We go up to Borre to-night. News is to hand to-day of the re-commencement of the German offensive & he has attacked the French between Soissons & Rhiems.  He had initial success, but I cannot say to what extent.  Also North of here he attacked but only on a small front, where he penetrated our line.  On this front our guns were busy last night but nothing happened. 
 Wednesday 29 May At A.D.S. at Borre where things have been very quiet all day.  To-night he burnt one of our balloons.
