<p>Oct. 7<br/>31.<br/>Met Alek Wilson and Mat. Miller turning in to our rendezvous &ndash; they details to 4th Battalion, and expecting to go up with the Batt tonight.</p>
<p>And wearing the 28th Colours going through Ypres yesterday I'm almost certain I saw Jimmy Tubbs.  The three 12th chaps still in the dugout; they were ordered to report by midday to 3rd Bgde. Hqs. &ndash; the order arrived to them per a Tommy Maj. at 2, so they're hanging in till tomorrow.</p>
<p>Capt. Davies &ndash; wounded when Morrie was killed, died of wounds yesterday.  He'll be a loss to the Ambulance, he being a gentleman and a Doctor.  Back at Petit sec Bois, he chased me over the camp, to advise me to register a letter I'd placed for censoring, a letter containing 10 Francs.  He was such Australian, so his popularity is half explained by his ancestry.</p>
<p>The bearers are out &ndash; in Ypres, one straggling tired party passed us, while we were held up by one of the corner congestions.  Harold Long leading &ndash; a different Harold from he of Steenvoorde, and Andy and Mac and Jhonno' &ndash; all tired and weary.</p>
<p>Oct. 7<br/>Frank Dunn too &ndash; changed almost beyond recognition.  Later I saw him by the Canal, and the hour out had charged him as a tonic.</p>
<p>There's no word of our relief.  Jack stayed at Menin Road to take Serg. Wilson's place, he evacuated sick, and Ted Reynolds here at the Wagon Rendezvous in his place.</p>
<p>Mail today &ndash; from Hendersons, John Drinkwater's 'Poems' and an intimation of Shaw's "Sanity of Art" being out of print and a 1st printing being available at 2/6.  'Letters of a Soldier' trans. from the French from the T.B.C.  That I'll read, and mark passages &ndash; and send it to Mother.  And another letter from Mat of six pages, a jolly chatty and good letter, received just an hour after my writing a dull cheerless letter to him &ndash; of missing and casualties.</p>
<p>The nights cold, and a grey laden sky is full of rain, but breaks of starr'd blue suggest the coming once again of the Boche raiding planes.</p>
