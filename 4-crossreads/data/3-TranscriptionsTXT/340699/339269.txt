 could be camouflaged were made glaringly apparent by well built entrances of white limestone and all the disguising in the world would only draw attention to the fact that they had been disguised. Some of our engineers and some American engineers stood about and when I'd asked them a question or two they told me the place was unhealthy; that Jerry had just ceased shelling and no one could say when he'd re-commence. It was a wild goose chase and made me reflect on how little the army uses its brains. They might as well have had a sign up "Here we are" and then seek to correct it by putting up another "We're not here now". After a careful study of the place I decided that nothing on earth could be done to ameliorate the condition and that it would not lend itself to any treatment I could prescribe, so I walked to where I had planted my awful camel and part pushed, part rode it back. I took a different route back, and in a little wood struck Capt. C. who was sick in his tent with Spanish flu, which we call "dog's disease". He was pretty bad.

I then told the adjutant that I couldn't manage to push a bicycle out so far but that I would go if I were given transport and added that I felt too tired and sick to pedal it. He told me to report to the critic officer but till now I haven't been able to get him. 
 St. Gratien, 25/6/18. Last night after several attempts I reported to quidnunc to whom I explained myself. He gave in to my arguments and allowed me a day off. So, all day long I've been stretching canvases and in spite of fatigue and painful stiffness I've had a good day: tomorrow, if it's fine, I'll have a better one. We have the
