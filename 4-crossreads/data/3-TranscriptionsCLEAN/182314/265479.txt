  
 The 26th moved to Bellewaarde [Ridge?] [words missing: torn page] again assumed command of them. The [torn page] Westhoek. This relief was not complete [torn page] 
 At 3. p.m. a party of 100 all told were [detailed?] [torn page] for cable burying. This party returned at 7. p.m. [torn page] [immediately?] reorganised and were issued with Bombs, S.A.A, [torn page] for operations in accordance with Bde Order, on morning [torn page] 9th Oct. At 4.30. p.m. I proceeded to Brigade Hqrs with state and verbally informed the G.O.C that the men were extremely tired and that the available strength was only 158 all told. 
 On arriving at Brigade I found that an alteration in disposition had been made and had to reconnoitre the new position  I did not returm to the Battn  until  at Westhoek until 11.30 p.m and having seen the G.O.C 6th Bde (under whose order the Battn came after Zero hour) at once reorganised into 4 Companies each approx 30 O/Ranks with One Lewis Gun. 
 At Zero hour 9th Oct. the Battalion after a very exhausting march due to the rain and mud arrived at point of assembly. Hqrs with 23 rd  Bn Hqrs. 
 According to orders of the 6th Brigade one Coy was at the disposal of  the  each Battalion Commander of the 6th Bde if required. The C.O's of the 21st, 23rd and 24th Bns each reinforced their front with the 28th Coys and one Coy was left which after supplying stretcher bearers consisted of 2 Officers and [16?] O/Ranks. 
 At mid-day orders were received that the Battn was being relieved in daylight by a Battn of the 12th Bde A.I.F. As this was imposible owing to the general mix up I proceeded to Bde Hqrs after arranging with each C.O of the 6th Bde to relieve the Coys of the Battn after dark. 
 I reported to the G.O.C's 7th and [6th?] Bdes and then on night 9/10th after making all arrangements re guides both for ingoing and outgoing troops proceeded to Infantry Barracks Ypres. 
 The 28th Battalion were finally relieved and in small parts reached Ypres Barracks by 9 a.m. on 10th Oct. 
 Attached please find list of casualties also state showing present strength and recommendations for gallant conduct. 
 I desire to state that I had to work under adverse conditions and after the Adjutant was wounded on 4.10.17 had practically no knowledge of the officers and men left in the Battalion whatever. The Assistant Adjutant Lieut Grose reported from the Transport Lines and his energy and devotion to duty was most marked but he also was handicapped. 
 In conclusion, Sir, I beg to state that I cannot speak too highly of the Officers, N.C.O's and men of the Battalion who one and all showed their loyalty to you and me under most exceptional circumstances carrying out their duties splendidly under such adverse conditions.
