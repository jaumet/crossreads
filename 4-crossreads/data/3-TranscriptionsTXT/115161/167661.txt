 at Messines and Passchandaele. 
 The camp to which I with others moved, was at  MORBEQUE , just outside Hazebrouck.&nbsp; Composed of tents (not camouflaged) made it a very good mark for the enemy on his nightly rounds in the air.&nbsp; Many a time have I screwed my small body into as small a space as possible, when that wretched sound of his &#39;plane gets nearer and nearer.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; it&#39;s a rotten feeling when he is above you.&nbsp; It&#39;s not where he intends to drop his&quot;eggs&quot; which worries so much, but it&#39;s where they fall. 
 The aircraft guard would blow three whistles (I mean three blasts on one whistle) as a sign to &quot;take cover&quot;.&nbsp; There was no chance of taking any more cover than the tent supplied, so why on earth did he blow the three blasts.&nbsp; It only succeeded in waking us up, whereas we might have slept through the visit.&nbsp; &quot;One&quot; blast on the whistle signified &quot;all clear&quot;.&nbsp; There were a good many &quot;blasts&quot; apart from those blown by the chap on guard. 
 While here it was the custom for us to go for a swim every few days.&nbsp; A canal was about four miles away, sluggish, muddy, stagnant, and almost choked with weeds.&nbsp; So sluggish and &quot;dead&quot; was the water that I doubt if a gale of wind could have produced the slightest ripple on it&#39;s surface, or upset the &quot;even&quot; tener of it&#39;s way, simply because it had no &quot;way&quot;.&nbsp; It was the quietest and most stationary piece of water I have ever seen.&nbsp; That we came out from it dirtier than when we entered is quite immaterial.&nbsp; What got me thinking was why we should have to march for this swim in &quot;fighting order&quot;. 
 Why we should have to carry our rifles and ammunition to this poor harmless, and silent canal was quite beyond my comprehension. 
 I have read that in some places in America it was on occasions necessary to &quot;shoot&quot; the rapids, of course in that case I could quite understand the necessity for &quot;fighting order&quot;, but to this canal, where the only fighting required was after you had got in the water - to fight against the mud and weeds in the struggle to reach the bank again - Well! it made me think very hard.
