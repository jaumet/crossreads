"High Wood" now merely a bunch oh ragged & smashed timber with all the ground pockmarked with shell holes it was in the fight for this wood that one of the Gloucester regiments I think was just about wiped out. At the bottom of this wood there is a great wooden cross erected by the officers & men who fell in the fight for it, one can easily understand why  the Germans struggled so hard to hold it for stretching a couple of miles behind it is pretty level ground & this afforded the Huns no protection at all although they had deeply dug trenches & masses of barbed wire protecting them but our guns smashed their defences to pieces as you can see as you go over the ground.Just on the edge of this wood there
