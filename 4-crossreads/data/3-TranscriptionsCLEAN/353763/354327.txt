 Lieut ?Keighly of the Destroyer Yarra was off for dinner - Guest of Captain he - Captain M, was late off & when inboard showed the usual signs of alcoholism - a disposition to overdo things for his guest & to contradict any statement put forward by anyone else  -  As this generally ends in trouble I took my usual precaution of being quite silent & clearing away as soon as I could  -  Captain M should have heard himself discussed subsequently by his officers  -  I put in the plea of alcoholism for him  -  We had some fair bridge & then our steward got drunk & forgot to make the beds & so with verbal skirmishes around me I retired & left things to come straight by lapse of time  -  What a God C6H12O6 is  -
