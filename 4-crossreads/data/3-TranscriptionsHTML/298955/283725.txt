<p>4 &ndash; E deMouncey<br/>concert was given by the [indecipherable] workers but this was very poor indeed one of their number a man named Dow made up &amp; recited an awful doggerel of a thing called Anchises &amp; her living cargo. He was cheered and counted out alternatively but he did not mind this but continued to the end.<br/>28th  Beautiful weather but  only did 274 miles for the run the A.M.B. &amp; the A.S.C. gave a combined concert which was quite passable.<br/>29th  Washing &amp; mending parade today as I had done mine a day or so before decided to have a good spell. I might mention as I had been appointed mess commander &amp; made a Lance Corporal I had very little to do &amp; as a matter of fact the whole unit had very little to do in the way of drill or anything else. Today received orders that 2 signallers &amp; one L/Corporal has to go on the Bridge for signalling purposes, also to keep a look out for submarines etc. with the officers. This has to be done day &amp; night. When in convoy there is both a lot of lamp &amp; semaphore signalling besides knowledge of international flag work.</p>
