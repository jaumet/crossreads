<p>leave again till 8 pm. I bought</p>
<p>some things in the morning &amp;</p>
<p>went out to The Bertram&#39;s at</p>
<p>High Constantia with Major</p>
<p>Campbell for lunch. Lay out</p>
<p>under the trees yarning all</p>
<p>the afternoon. Came back to</p>
<p>the Grand Hotel for dinner.</p>
<p>&amp; back to the boat at 8 pm.</p>
