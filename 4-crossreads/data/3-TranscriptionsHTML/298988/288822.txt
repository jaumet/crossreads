<p>Feby 21st (Sunday)<br/>Arrived Colombo 8 p.m. &amp; anchored in the Breakwater, a very fine structure with a narrow entrance, but plenty of water &amp; a Lighthouse built on one side of it.  The Chief Engineer &amp; I went ashore, or rather to the Lighthouse with the Pilot who piloted us in, &amp; after looking over it we went on shore &amp; up on to the Roof Garden of the Grand Oriental Hotel a very fine place about twice as big, almost, as the "Australia" in Sydney.  Everything goes on the same in Colombo on Sundays as on other days &amp; there were a lot of men &amp; women in the Hotel, mostly in evening dress.  They had just finished dinner which is on from 8 till 9.30 p.m.  The people here have a "snack" (Chota Hassary) early in the morning, then breakfast at 9.30 &amp; Tiffin (Lunch) at 3 p.m.  There seems to be hundreds of Native servants in this Hotel, there being one or two stationed at every corner in the building &amp; they all seem to find something to do for you, consequently a lot of "tipping" is necessary, but as amounts are small, it does not matter much.  There's 100 cents to a rupee (1/4) &amp; that goes a good way, when you get used to the business.  After having a "Ginger beer" we got in a Rickshaw &amp; rode round to Empire Theatre or Picture Palace.  You buy tickets &amp; go in &amp; take a seat in a garden where there is a bar, it being mostly considered as a meeting place of the Clan</p>
