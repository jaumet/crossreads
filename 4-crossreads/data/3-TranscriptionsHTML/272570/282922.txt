<p>a lorry &amp; came back to Corbie.<br/>Tuesday 27 Aug.<br/>The whole brigade have come out for a rest at last &amp; we went &amp; joined the rest of the 13th Battalion in a village called Poulainville. We got a lorry as far as Pont-Noyelles, so we rode to there, then tramped on to Querrieu, where we got another lorry to Allonville &amp; it took us on to within a couple of kilos of Poulainville. We found the battalion billeted in barns in the village. As usual in all French villages the church stands high above every other building, &amp; is easily the best. Even if it's a small village in France, the church is always a good building with a high spire sticking up &amp; is visible for miles around. I am in a little barn with 10 chaps, slept in the straw, &amp; it was warm &amp; comfortable with a blanket. Oh well, the 4th Brigade &amp; the 13th Battalion particularly have suffered pretty severely in these big attacks against Fritz during the last six weeks but our losses are light compared to what we've dealt out to him. His prisoners alone exceed our casualties. As this big advance has continued on all fronts, day by day with ours, it is evident to all of us that the war has completely swung our way at last, &amp; the German menace seems at last</p>
