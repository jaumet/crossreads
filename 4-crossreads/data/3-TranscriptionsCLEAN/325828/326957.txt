  
 I am enclosing a short note to her & am sending her two X Xs which I hope she will receive alright By the same mail I received a letter from Mother dated 14/5/1916.  Thank you Mumie dear for your lovely note & news contained in it. I saw Rid about 10 days ago- one Saturday evening.  He was going to hold a service in the village the next day, but the next day we were hard at it on the move.  Marvellous?  9 times out of 10 that we move it is on Sunday. Must close now with best love to you all at home. Your loving son, Leo.
