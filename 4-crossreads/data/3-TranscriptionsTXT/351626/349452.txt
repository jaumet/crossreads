 Westham Camp. Weymouth. England 4.1.1916 Dear Mother, I am here at the final base from which we leave England,   &amp; am at present supposed to be waiting for a boat home but may not catch the next one which leaves in a few days: in fact it is not yet quite certain   yet   whether I shall go at all but is probable.  Am quite alright now except for leg being still a bit weak.  I hope this letter will reach you in time to wish you many happy returns of the 14th prox.   &amp; also the same to Marg.  If Connie   &amp; Donald are in Sydney now  remember    give my love to the whole "Darn" family including   them    the boys.  This is a rotten place here for rain   &amp; mud so the sooner I get somewhere else the better.  It rains here nearly all the time   &amp; if we get half a fine day
