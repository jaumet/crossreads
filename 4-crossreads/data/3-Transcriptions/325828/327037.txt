<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-2-<br/>never been inside a London pub yet.  Where our headquarters are, is a very "low" locality, much on the same scale as Woolloomooloo in Sydney.  I was astounded &amp; disgusted when I first came to London to see the women &amp; girls in the pubs here scoffing down their beer, as we do our water &amp; tea in Ausy.<br/>The crowds of ill-dressed &amp; half-starved youngsters prowling about the streets would surprise you   As I say, Westminster is a very poor locality, &amp; this is only to be expected.  I haven't taken to liquor yet, thank goodness, &amp; I am glad to say it has no enticement for me.  And what I am better pleased at is this that our Medical Officer here, Capt. Kenneth Rodas de Vere Shaw my senior officer is a strict abstainer.  I have suspected for some time that this man has blue blood in his veins, &amp; found out a few days ago, that he &amp; Sir Gerald Strickland are first cousins.<br/>He is as true a man as you could wish to meet, &amp; I am proud to work under him.<br/>Was glad to hear of Anna's success at the Intermediate Exam. &amp; I am sure she deserved it.  She has more grit &amp; brains in her than her youngest brother, but as long as I can earn my salt- why worry.</p>
