<p>following the Train line through the Square &amp; in a few moments arrived at the Salvation Army Hostel where I went in upstairs &amp; obtained a Cup of Tea &amp; having some Rations with me I had a light Meal, then I continued on passing over another Canal to the Australian Supply Depot, where I met some friends &amp; was invited to come back at 12 for Dinner, after a stroll around the Docks I returned &amp; had a Bon Dinner with the Boys, after a Smoke I thanked them &amp; off I went, I was directed to follow the Train Line &amp; soon I would be at Milo Les Sands which was a favorite Promenade along the Beach in Pre War Times, After walking some distance I arrived at the Ramparts where a Sentry demanded my Pass &amp; then I was permitted to proceed &amp; arrived at Milo Les Sands in a few minutes &amp; found the Promenade &amp; Beach almost deserted &amp; in a very neglected condition, Nearly all the Beautiful Buildings are nearly all empty &amp; closed up &amp; the place is very desolate, As my Train for my return Journey did not leave until 5 Pm</p>
