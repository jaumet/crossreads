body of men in this hospital, the very hardest to manage in the whole expedition yet they have heaps of food and to spare, and there is a surplusage in money at the end of each month.  I think that I referred to it I fancy earlier in this letter but it will bear repeating.   I shall write to Senator Pearce about it.
The war still goes on looking more favourable each day for the side of the enemy.   The full text of Ian Hamiltons report on the Galipoli affair has been published in pieces in some of the local papers, and to day a London paper came to me from Hyman which contained the whole report.  It is a history of a wonderful landing, but beyond it is but a repetition of attack and defence to which we have become so accustomed at Ypres, the Argonne and else where.   We have been led to believe, by the preparations that are being made for extra wounded that a big battle is taking place on the peninsula, but so far it does not appear to have eventuated.  Let us hope that when it does all will end in favour of our people, it will be a change to have a real success.  Still do I fear the German weight.
Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night. Good night.[A line of Xs and Os.]Tabbie. Geordie. Kitty.
I shall post this letter tomorrow that it may be in time for any steamer that may go south through the canal, tomorrow will be Sunday, leaving to a supplement any other sentences that come into my mind and seem to me to be of some interest or amusement to you.  For the present I shall say good bye, and invoke the gods to pour upon you good fortune in all the ways that you most desire, as well in the other directions where good may come to you, though it be in lesser streams, from the horn of the gift carrying female, who now, as adown the ages, is and was the allotted dispenser of every thing that we believe to be good.   It is well for each of us to so believe.   Think you so with me?  Still as always do I thank God that the hand that hath made each of you fair has also made each of you good.  Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on each of you, while Heaven gives you many many happy hours.  With heaps of love and loads of kissesyour affectionate fatherJohn B. Nash.
