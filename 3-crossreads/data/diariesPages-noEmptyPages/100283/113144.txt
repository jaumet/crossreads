in the big Hall on Map reading, Prismatic Compass.
20th. Paraded with our overcoats on this morning for it was raining lightly everything very sloppy wet. We went out to the live practicing ground the officer in charge gave a demonstration of the various flares rockets signals smoke bombs etc, it was most interesting though the smoke fumes were almost choking at times.
After this was finished we fired bombs till 12 oclock then home for dinner, the next item on the programme was one of the funniest things you ever saw, the whole school had to take part in a 4 mile cross-country race, a lot of the chaps took their tunics putties some took their shirts off
