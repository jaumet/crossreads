<p>MAY 1917</p>
<p>15 TUESDAY</p>
<p>F,ine but very cold in evening</p>
<p>We packed up &amp; moved off</p>
<p>at 10.30 AM &amp; arrived at our</p>
<p>new quarters about midday. The</p>
<p>horselines are in the open &amp; I</p>
<p>have rigged up a bit of a fly</p>
<p>&amp; half a dozen of us camp there.</p>
<p>Took ammunition up at night</p>
<p>Altogether it is not a bad</p>
<p>joint &amp; we have been in</p>
<p>a jolly side worse.</p>
<p>I saw a lot of the preparations</p>
<p>made for the push shortly for</p>
<p>Messines &amp; they are marvellous.</p>
<p>Every tree hides a gun of some</p>
<p>sort &amp; the place is a network</p>
<p>of light railways</p>
<p>I got a parcel of socks ect from</p>
<p>Jo</p>
