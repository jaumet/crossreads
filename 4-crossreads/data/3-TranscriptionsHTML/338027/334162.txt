<p>Saturday, 10 April, 1915<br/>The new ward is not as nice or the sisters are not as nice as the old one.  We have twice the freedom and can walk out into the gardens for a smoke.  Leave has been granted again for troops to visit Cairo but only 10% a night.</p>
<p>My pleurisy pains have become more acute but otherwise I am well, Capt. Hume Turnbull my dr says that they will pass away quickly.</p>
<p>We were all in bed at 8.30, lights out at 8 pm when we heard a lot of cheering, singing, &amp; bands playing so we all jumped out of bed in spite of sisters threats and rushed down to the gate just in time to see the 4th Bde of Inf. Going away.  A lot of our chaps belonged to it and were being left, and they seemed broken hearted over it however we gave them a cheer from the pyjama brigade.</p>
<p>Sunday, 11 April, 1915<br/>Visiting day I had a lot of mates in to see me from the Camp &amp; Mena &amp; Abbassia.  One is a newly appointed W. O. of Abbassia Convalescent Camp and he told me that if I came out there he would give me an acting sergt's position.</p>
<p>I was very amused to hear more of "Sammy" escapades.  In my absence he had to be exercised so a big fellow volunteered to ride him and Sammy resented his weight and promptly threw him.  Then a reinforcement rode him and he let him get a fair distance from the camp then Sammy threw him eight times before he arrived home.</p>
<p>Part of the 14th Batt. Went to-night.  Sister gets me doing part of her work now and for being obliging I am doing too much.  In the p.m I took the pulse &amp; temp of the whole ward (60) then made the charts out.</p>
