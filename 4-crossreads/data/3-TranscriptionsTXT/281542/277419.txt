You hear their weird song which sings them on their way, & it becomes intensified as they approach nearer but you don't know where they are going to land.  It is impossible to locate them until they have struck, & then up goes everything within their reach.  The concussion is frightfully & powerfully intense & you are lifted about as if you were a mere straw.  What puny mites we are & how helpless one feels against these mighty engines of war.  "Dig" is Kitchener's advice, & that is the only advice.  Hide yourself in the bowels of the earth.
Capt. C.W. Melvill, New Zealand Staff Corps, has arrived & taken the place of Capt. Mair as GSO (3).  He tells many interesting & amusing tales of his experiences in France 12 months ago in the battle of the Aisne & other stupendous struggles in the early stages of the war.  He had his arms & legs lacerated by H-E, & had 4 months in hospital in England.
His recital of instances of the brutal callousness of German methods of warfare were to a degree more repulsive than I have read of despite the horribleness of some of the latter have been.
He tells us of German officers entering quiet homes of the villagers & stabling their horses in the dining & drawing rooms tying them up to pianos, bedsteads, etc., & generally converting the houses into dung pits & cesspits for their filthy excreta - being blackguardly plunder & desecration of beautiful homes.

Lord Kitchener paid a short visit to Anzac where he was introduced to various Divisl. & Bde Commdrs.  He was given a great cheer on his arrival.  It was a peremptory official visit and he was gone again after an inspection of the various posts.
