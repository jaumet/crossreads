the smell of of an oily rag.Well we went up this afternoon I took 24 men with me, & we got sopping soaking wet, we only worked about an hour & down she come by the time we reached our dugouts" & by the way we felt so disgusted & miserable that we walked over the top & in full view of the Hun guns for nearly a mile, did not care if we stopped one or not, arrived at our dugouts expecting to find them fairly dry but no we found about 2 ft of water in it & half the dugouts fallen in & us wet to the skin & nothing dry to change into, all our blankets & overcoats sopping a pretty state of affairs, & you may not believe it judging by the writing & the book but I am at this present moment cold as ice wet to the skin, & no dry clothes, & as hungry as a hawk enough to kill any man & nearly every Australian is in the same mess to-night of on this famous "Somme"
