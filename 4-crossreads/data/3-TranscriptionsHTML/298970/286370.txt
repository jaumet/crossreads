<p>20 men were wounded by these two shells.<br/>An aeroplane decended in the fields near us on the way back to Elbow Farm.  It seems that the airman was hit whilst over Lille and he volplaned down to our lines.  Today we had a look round the ruins of the Fleurbaix Church.  No sooner had we got into bed at Elbow Farm than we heard the call for A.M.C. men.  We went over to where the man was lying, carried him into our dug-out and soon decided that drink was the only complaint.  He couldn't return to his unit in this state so we put him to bed.</p>
<p>6th August (Sunday)</p>
<p>The bird gave trouble all night.  We got rid of him at daybreak and slept in till 11 a.m.  Quiet day</p>
