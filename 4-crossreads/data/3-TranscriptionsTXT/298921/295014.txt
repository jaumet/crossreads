I am doing all I can to see the Historical places while here & at [indecipherable]. Went to the Pyramids yesterday, rode camel with the Medical Officer & returned by Donkey - the Sphinx lies [indecipherable] beyond - I went into the heart of the Pyramid & saw the tomb of an ancient monarch buried 4000 B.C. Statistics as to size etc. can be read in Encyclopedias but the atmoSphere inside is filthy the Catacomb passage like a combat hole.In the evening went to Meddi Camp finished up at the Casino. My French is very rusty & if a boy could only look ahead at school he would pay more attention to his languages - [indecipherable] in the Casino can speak 5 or 6 languages.
