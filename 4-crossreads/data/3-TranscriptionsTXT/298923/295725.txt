 28 February 1918 Thursday (Whole page crossed out) We are top dog in the air at present, so no bombing- If you enclosed any of my Diary in your letter of Jany 6th it did not arrive but papers came many thanks. I cabled you my arrival in Egypt, apparently never received.  Hope you all got away for a change this month.  I am fit &amp; well I think I asked you before if you knew anything of a Miss Keighan a Melbourne girl who is a Red  x  Cook at Port Said.  Dolly has made a friend of her, &amp; of course I would like to hear something of her.
