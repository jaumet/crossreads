One flash little beggar let me have it behind the calf of my leg &amp; of course there is a bruise to tell the tale. One fellow got rolled over twice &amp; is in the hospital. Another chap got a kick in the backside &amp; fainted, &amp; a silly coot jabbed a bayonet into an artery in his arm &amp; lost half his blood. Rather early for bayonet work is'nt it?
Apart from a few casulities like these the camp is running beautifully. They have shower baths rigged up now &amp; thats a boon. What strikes me - &amp; it would you &ndash; is that all the crowd here are all clean &amp; they nearly all use the toothbrush freely.
Our camp is made up of Gordon Robertson, Clarence McDougall, Archibald E. Gordon-Campbell, Billie Robinson, Sydney Robertson Leslie Stark, an Englishman named Willott who is a science master at the Toowoomba Grammar School &amp; taught under Rolph, at "Wolaroi School" at Orange just after we had left. He's a milatary man &amp; served in the Belgian Guard Civic also England &amp; New Zealand. All these chaps are gentleman.
