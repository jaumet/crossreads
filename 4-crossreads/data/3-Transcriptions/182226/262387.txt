<p>Friday 31 December, 1915</p>
<p>Went into Valletta, De Mattos &amp; Sheen, two friends of mine managed to get a few shillings which was nearly all spent.</p>
<p>Coming home we met two nurses &amp; took them home to St Patrick&#39;s Hospital.</p>
<p>Were too tired to see the New Year in so we went to bed at 11.30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn to January 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;in front for continuation.</p>
