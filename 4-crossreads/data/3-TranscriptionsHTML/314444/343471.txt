<p>To Mr Ifould</p>
<p>I saw in one of the Sydney papers that you are calling for copies of papers or magazines born through the Service boys. I'm enclosing the Egyptian War Cry  this is a paper published monthly &amp; edited by a Private Johnson who is stationed at Alexandria Egypt often the paper contains contributions of Australian Salvationists.</p>
<p>Subscriptions for same is sent on to the Editor from the service boys although sanctioned by Gen Booth &amp; the Military &amp; is entirely managed by boys in Khaki &amp; they have even started work amongst the Egyptians &amp; later I think Egypt will be calling for missionaries to start their wonderful organization in that Country the first editions were type written but I'm unable to obtain copies.</p>
<p>I am yours Sincerely<br/>H. C. Cook 16925<br/>Anzac Mtd Div [indecipherable]<br/>Palestine</p>
