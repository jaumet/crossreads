 Messines Weather beautiful, warm fine and clear. Spent forenoon at pit, and proceeded with Russell and Costa down to Kemmel. Met Dick Pennell at 5.10 pm. and had the privilege of seeing a very good show. Kookaburras. Hobbs and his staff were present. During the afternoon a German Observation balloon was brought down at Kemmel. I received a souvenier portion from Watson.
