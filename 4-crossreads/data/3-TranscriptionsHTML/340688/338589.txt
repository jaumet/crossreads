<p>and 3 ton of pickets rather heavy &amp; MacMillan Linton and Doyle of my party with a good few others gave up and sat in a trench I carried on until we reached some high ground and a mound where we had to stop as barrage was playing on 2nd Objective.</p>
<p>We were right up with infantry who were waiting for the barrage to lift. Grand sight and barrage pretty good and absence of Fritz and <strike>we</strike> infantry nonchalantly strolling everywhere. Barrage lifted and we followed in about 30 minutes Ground area of 3rd Brigade already all marked out and we pushed on to where barrage was playing over 3rd objective and Price &amp; MacKenzie marked out strong point and we got to work. 3rd Wave went over in artillery formation. Worked hard and soon linked up.</p>
<p>A party of 8 germans came running over on our right from a pill box they had got out of and with hands up and very scared. They were a very laughable sight although they left behind intact a pill box 2 machine guns and a huge quantity of ammunition which might have done considerable damage.</p>
<p>We heard from runners Pope and Prince that enemy detachments had been observed moving up towards Polygon Wood for counter attacking about 10 and were expected at 12. Soon after 1 we observed Fritz hopping over the hill in front line into a trench &amp; thence to the rear of a big mound in front whence they came round to an apparent trench on the mound and facing us where was situated several pill boxes. A few scraggy trees were on top of the mound and the largest had a boxlike O.P. which seemed intact. A few sniping shots were sent over and the two machine guns captured in charge</p>
