There really isn't any answer I can give that will be of any use, because it will be the middle of May before this reaches you and Emily will have had her holiday & the be back again.  I am sure it will be all right though.  Do tell me the "washer-lady's" new mixture, I shall be interested, besides I do some of my own washing here, some of the small things, and it might be useful.

Oh for a sight of that charming cheeky Scamp lifting Father's hat off as he was gathering apples; don't imagine that I would rather see the little villain than you, because the very fact of seeing her would involve seeing you.Horror of horrors, forgive me for interrupting myself again but the use of the word "scrapeiness" for my special benefit recalls to me an appalling misdoing of mine the other day, & I must confess to my U.S. father.
