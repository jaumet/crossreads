 Thursday 10th -5 We were supposed to go home today, but as no motor car arrived we could not do so.  We may have better luck to-morrow.  The children here at the Chateau speak English very well.  I have spoken to them several times.  I like the little girl very much.  The Marquise is ill with Diphtheria so is the eldest son, there remain one boy nearly 9 (John) &amp; a little girl about 7.  I seen a big shell hole today in the grounds.  I can never praise these woods enough.
