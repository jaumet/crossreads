<p>8 January 1918 Tuesday<br/>Raining again.<br/>You remember me speaking of a Capt HURLEY Antartic explorer on S.S. Malta- attached to War Correspondent here, he took Cinema photos of 1st L.H. Brigade today on the march-  a pity he could not be on the real job-  Hurley a very interesting man to talk to-<br/>We have no candles &amp; the days are short- in the blankets is the best spot.<br/>New forms of WILLS have been issued so my Paybook one is the same viz &pound; 1500 to MATER any balance to wife.</p>
