preparatory to our final (?) departure tomorrow. We understand that the "Eastern" is to take the invalids, and the remainder will travel on the "Navua". There will probably be about 1150 troops all told on both vessels. So, dear diary, this is positively my last appearance at this theatre (perhaps).Fri, 12th on board T.S.S. "Navua" at sea : "Rolling Home". Thank God, this time it's true. We left Rabaul at 4 pm on Wednesday. As the vessel drew away from the wharf the thousand men aboard broke into a roar of cheers which was answered by a feebler roar from the "Druids" & others left behind. The "Eastern" left at noon & she will in all probability reach Sydney a day ahead of us.During Wednesday afternoon & night the men were rather discontented, their quarters being none of the best. But they brightened up considerably yesterday when they found that all deck space was made available to them except a portion about 12 feet square reserved for Officers. At night they are free to sling hammocks where they please.Last night they were in excellent spirits & broke into song, ragtime of course predominating. The chorus of "Tipperary" found favour when altered thus,"It's a long, long way to Sydney Harbour,It's a long, long way to go;It's a long, long way to Sydney Harbour,To the sweetest girl I know."
