78 wks from home
Hopped out at usual time.
Nothing to do at all only messed round to fill in time at lunch time went out for the usual ride to the Palms.
More "willys" visit us today 5 were to be seen in the air at once as usual heaps of wind dust accompany them, the niggers don't seem to mind how many there are.
Burrell rang up against a nigger last night got two lovely black eyes, he was after a writing pad but finding none at this particular place he walked off when the nig called him back quilted him one each in either eye, Frank then pitched into him gave him a few beauts, the nig off for his life, then gave him in charge for assault.
Played cards turned in early. 10 pm.

Revielle as usual
Burrell's eyes look lovely at lunch time the nigger came down to be examined by Col Dixon, he got well-nigh killed by our chaps. I ran over him with the bike for one now I don't think he will trouble us too much although we expect to give him a rough house, he's by no means unmarked either.
Chas Cox again off duty for bad feet it looks as if they are going to take some curing. Opie too is still suffering from the effects of his fall off Kute so Wills Watkins have been told off to take their places temporally.
Pulled my old bus down again, she was in splendid condition inside despite a little carbon, the niggers amused themselves pulling the pump handle up once or twice.
Mail in a few days. Bed 9.10.
