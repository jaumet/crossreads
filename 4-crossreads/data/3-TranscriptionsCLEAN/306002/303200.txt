  
 21.6.15 Mon. 21st.  Nearly 9 oclock this morning before we raised enough energy to get up & get breakfast ready, soon after we rose the Turks artillery commenced to drop shells on the point of Popes Hill, they had the range to a nicety & dropped the shells right on the trenches, they fired about 20 shots before our 6 inch Howitzer opened up & silenced her after firing 5 or 6 shots.  Stan & Smithers had to go on a sapping party at one o'clock, we received a large mail to-day from Aus. & England.  I was agreeably surprised to get a letter from Lilian Tomlins.  The warboats have been firing continuously all the afternoon, about 3 o'clock several Turkish shells fell right amongst the 3rd L.H. dug-outs on the hill opposite us, none of the shells exploded before landing & no one was hurt by them.
