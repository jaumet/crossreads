& not the best for billeting but two of us arranged for a billet of our own & we were extremely comfortable, in an attic.
Wednesday 1st August   Raining all day & most miserable everyone almost being wet through.  Not having much to do spent a part of the time in my attic writing letters.  The place full of refugees as the huns have been shelling places 20 miles behind the line.  Very sad to see a load of furniture followed by the owners trudging along looking for a home.  For 3 years this area has been safe to within a couple of miles of the line, now the new offensive has changed the whole area.  A vast effort is apparently going to be made here, troops are everywhere & any day we expect it to start when we will all take our turn.  The huns know that it is coming & are attempting to upset our arrangements
