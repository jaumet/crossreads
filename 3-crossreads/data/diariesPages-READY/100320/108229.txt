2/11/ Yzeux
Raining this morning so stayed in all the morning. After lunch the General rang up rather obstructing the leave of James but I spoke to him and sent James off with a pass in his pocket. Then walked down to a ground the other side of Belloy and there saw the 24th and 22nd clash in a football match and 24 win. Stayed in all evening.

3/11/18 Rode over to St Vast. a dull grey morning trying to rain. Saw all my old friends there and hand lunch on the spot. Then went down to the Transport lines and had a look at our crack cooker and limber for the horse show. Rode back after and feeling unwell turned into bed. Another boil today. McColl & James both went on leave today. Bazeley from DHQ is here acting as BM.
