Tues. Jan 15
Rain, snow and Frost all mixed up. The roads are in an awful mess. On Sunday we moved from No 10 to No 7 Camp. It is much better here as we have our meals in the Hut and don't have to crowd into a Mess Hut. Yesterday we were issued with our gear. A load big enough for a Pack mule. I've got a rotten cold. Really ought to write some Letters, but can't settle down to it.
Wed. 16
More Route marching. On parade they called out for some men to work at H.Q; so I hopped out for one, as I'm sick of paddling about in the slush. I reported at 5.30 and was put on as Waiter in the Mess. Plenty of good tucker and it's .
Thur. Jan 17. FRANCIS? Birthday
Weather rotten, snow, hail and wind. Doing pretty good at Headquarters. The only draw back is that one has to work so late. They have a formal dinner every Thursday night and it keeps us busy. Wrote to France.
Fri. 18
Got a letter from France today. She seems to like Egypt alright. There is a lot of talk going round the Camp about us going to Egypt, but I don't think there's anything in it.
Sat. 19. 
I have been sleeping in 8 Hut, No 7 Camp, but it is a fair distance away from H.Q., and is a nuisance if one wants a wash or brush up, so I spoke to the Corp. about it, and today I moved my things up to the Fire Station which is quite near. At night I went to the Canteen and won 6/- playing House.
