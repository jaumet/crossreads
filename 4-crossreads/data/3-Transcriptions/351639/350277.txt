<p>[Continuation of Compton Mackenzie's despatch of 30 June 1915]<br/>as a fighting unit one Turk is worth two Germans.  In fact with his back to the wall the Turk is magnificent.  The French casualties were about 2500, marvellously few considering what a day it had been, what an enemy was being attacked, and how much had been gained.  The right of the line now commands Kereves Dere, and the profile of Achi Baba seems to write itself less solidly against the sky.</p>
