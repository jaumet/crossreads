 
Gas was then released & we had to stand for 3 minutes in it. My helmet fitted me nicely. & apart from a stinging sensation in the eyes which turned them blood shot, I felt no ill result. Some however, whose helmet did not fit them too well, caught it hot, & they would throw themselves at the door & tumble out, with water running from their eyes in streams. This is caused through a badly fitting helmet & same is condemned. The ill effects pass off in a few hours. The new helmets are made on the German system only being very much better on account of different chemicals being used to absorb the various gases. It is a face mask which fits tightly round the face. A tube to go in the mouth, same being connected with, a tank containing chemicals which turn bad air into oxygen. The only inconvenience is a little suffocation.

14.10.16 Saturday

Weather still dull & windy & very cold nothing of any note occurred. We have heard unofficially that we move from here in 2 weeks time, leaving a man in charge of the camp so evidently we will not be away very long.

I was speaking to some members of the 14th yesterday & they say they are being worked to death. Hear me smile
