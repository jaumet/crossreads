  
 25 Monday We only had two wounded patients today, the first since we had the wounded German major.  Preparations were made for a stunt which was supposed to come off during the night, but nothing happened.  Every thing was exceptionally quiet during the evening.  A beautiful day.  I wrote seven letters during the day & sent 3 handerchiefs to my sisters & one to my mother. 
 26 Tuesday A fellow couldn't wish for better weather than we are getting here now, although it gets rather cold of a night time.  There are 5 big 12" guns being placed round here, one was fixed up this afternoon & fired 8 shots, the sound nearly deafens a person, you can see the shell of this gun if you look intently, when it is fired.  One of our airoplanes was brought down this morning, & the Pilot died of wounds this afternoon, he was only 16 years old. 
 27 Wednesday There are two anti-aircraft guns about two hundred yards away & we are practically surrounded by 18 pounders up to 12 inch guns.  They make a terrible row when they all start.  Pte Whiting gave me 3 francs (2/6) to do his shift on gas picket, I was on from 12.30 am till 3.30 am 28/th. I read nearly all the time, that is when the rats kept quiet.
