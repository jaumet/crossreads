  
 It is now 8.A.M. & they are holding a sing song on top & old Brotchie a Sgt from our table is singing for the 6th consecutive Sunday night "Where is my wandering boy tonight" much to the amusement of everyone   the service wouldn't be complete now without old Brotchies solo. 
 13th. Still as rough as blazes & last night I felt real rotten  had to go to bed early to save myself from being sick, I am proving a really rotten sailor this trip, & I am not looking forward with any great pleasure to my run across "Bass Straights". 
 Have just come down from listening to a challenge debate between our YMCA. Rep & C.SM. Kemp, the former put up a really fine argument & brought all sorts of facts to prove his statements.
