  
 if we get a stretch of cold weather the side is very painful from a gnawing sort of ache; otherwise I feel A1 at Lloyds. One of the Officers from here is trying to get away to France.   If he goes within the next week or so, I am putting in to go with him.  I like it well enough here but for one or two things.  Living is very high & the allowance isn't sufficient for exs. & a man is all the time wanting money. It was snowing here when I turned out on Wednesday morning.  A very pretty sight certainly, but too cold & what's worse too slippery for my fancy. Plenty of work in the Medical Line here & I find the day is gone before I realize it. Wal  will be interested to know I ran across 1st Lieut. (Fatty) Lloyd (3rd of 17th) here today.  He is in a M.G.C in 3rd Division, but is at present a B class man on account of stoutness.  Have heard there is a mail tonight via Yankee Land so hope this will be in time. Will write again soon, Much love to all at home, Your loving Son Leo
