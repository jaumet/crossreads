8 Sept, 1916MontazahI am all ready for a move once more.  The hand is blistered on the sore again I hope its not going to turn septic again. Eggs for breakfast this morning.  Its always a lively scene when eggs are on.  One boy said he got one good egg out of four.  he was told he was lucky.  I got two out of three.  In the boom.  Some whisky knocking about last night evidently by the liveness of certain lads.  "?" Where do they get it?Bottled stuff prohibited;  One bright lad said it was possible to get the chap behind the counter to sell a bottle to himself & influence him to make  you a present of it.It seems red hot in clobber again after doing the [indecipherable] act for so long.
9th  SatGot my watch - its quite important I feel to be able to tell people the time in stead of asking it.  Nine letter were given me also
