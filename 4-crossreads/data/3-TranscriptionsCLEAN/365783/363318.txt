  
 The case lasted for about two hours, the saloon became very sultry from the numbers present & at 11 PM the trial broke up in disorder, the jury sneaked away while the judge was summing up & demanded that the Judge shout drinks all round. My turn for duty as officer of the day came round on 23rd inst.   This means that I will not be on duty during the stay in Colombo (now 4 days distant)   There has of late been great speculation amongst us all as to who will be the unfortunate ones that must stick to the ship while we are in port.   As officer of the day one exercises a general supervision over the work of the Captains of the day that are detailed from each of the five units on the ship.   Some of the Captains are very slack & require a lot of shaking up.   It was necessary for me to issue a mild reprimand to several of them.   Sports for the men of our hospital were held in the afternoon.  Fred competed in some of the events.   A notice was today posted up to the effect that Father Neptune would visit the ship on the morrow.  24th Dec.    A bit of good news for you to day - whilst trimming the moustache this morning I accidentally took too much off one side.   It looked so ugly that after many regrets I decided to get rid of the lot.
