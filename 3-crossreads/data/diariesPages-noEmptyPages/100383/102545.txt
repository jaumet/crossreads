November 1916

On reaching support trench found it situated on the western Eastern side of a sunken road & from here could be seen a couple of small villages a little advance of our front line & away in the distant about two miles could be seen a chimney stack & steeple belonging to the town of Bapaume. Next day our company releived "B" Coy in supports & one platoon went into firing line & it was while in these position we stood some fairly heavy artillery fire from the enemy. The next morning the 4th we lost our Colonel, he was shot by a sniper & afterwards died & it came a great blow to the battalion for he was a good soldier & a great leader & was shot while in execution of his duty. During the same night the First & Third Battalion set out to take a line of trenches. The First were knocked back but Third gained objective & early next morning a number of "A" company self included had to set out & dig in a little advance to line taken & after get well down had to evacuate at d  just before day break for owing to the First Battalion not coming up on our left Fritz occupied his old line which we took & he was then on three sides of us. It was hard luck but these unforeseen occurrences will happen.
