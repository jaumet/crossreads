<p>train.  I caught the 10.45 p.m. train &amp; strange to say I went right off to sleep &amp; only woke with a terrible start just as the Train was pulling up at Peterboro [also spelt Peterborough].  All the Grimsby crowd change here &amp; we had to wait for a Train from 12.30 a.m. to 3.15 a.m.  I met a Canadian who seemed pretty decent so we hied to the little Tavern which is run as a Resting House for Troops by the St. Johns Ambulance Association workers.  After supper we walked all around Peterboro &amp; through the Cemetry past the grand old Cathedral.  I eventually arrived at Jennie's Home at 6 a.m.</p>
