<p>Sunday 23 April 1916<br/>A most glorious Easter Sunday, bright &amp; clear, with hardly any wind but with plenty of joyful sky-lark songs. Went to the C. of E. Communion Service in the Y.M.C.A. tent at 7 &amp; found abt. 70 present. At 8.45 the Presbyterian Parade was held, &amp; the C. of E. at 9.30. As Divl. Orderly Officer had to take charge of both parades. Formen took Acts 17:32-34, &amp; latter the exhortation to Christians to rise to things above, seeing that Christ is risen from the dead.<br/>It was a most helpful service. Just afterwards saw a British battleplane passing overhead. During the morning a trainload of Belgians passed thro' going N. Had to do the inspection rounds, turn out guard &amp;c. but spent remainder of time writing. Visited by Leo's friend Percy Limn, now one of the A.M.C. details.</p>
