  
 9th Nov:- Work as usual. A train of wounded and sick from the front arrived at 1-30 pm   & we are kept busy getting them into bed  This is not my first train. One arrived on Sunday & it is a sorry sight. The long white train steams in    & the stream of khaki turns out  some limping, legs, arms, eyes heads bandaged up. Others ill, enteric & dysentery mostly. These men who go out some few weeks before fully equipped now return & some have a few odd clothes & kits, others have the clothes they stand in only. But all cheerful. "Hello Bill  How is it?" from a friend. "Good-oh" says Bill. War as it should be seen at home to make of few of the shirkers come along &  give a hand.  I again visit Kasr-ly-ani Hospital with friend
