2/9/19 Pt. Adelaidewe moved into a berth vacated by "Orsova". After some delay we managed to get our SA &amp; WA off but the crowding jostling and general undiscipline of the men reached its climax when a general rushing exodus took place down the gangway and on to the wharf. The ship was soon nearly empty and I went to bed.
3/9/19 Doc, Padre &amp; Hinch had a night out. We sailed at dawn and had a smooth run all day. It was very pretty running between Kangaroo Island and the mainland (Cape Jarvis) cliffs and surf. Trouble with fresh water persists today.
4/9/19 A busy day. Blankets and hammocks checked. Mess gear parcels called in. Paid over &amp;pound5000 out to Melbourne men. We passed Cape Otway light at 8 and expect to be at the Heads in 4 hours.
