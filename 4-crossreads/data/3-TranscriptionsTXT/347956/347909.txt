Fri 5thSignalling close to camp this morning; the troops have gone to the range for musketry;  We went over to the HQ lines after dinner & found they were giving us a half holiday on account of Bivouac to-night, so we played "quoits" all until it was time to fall in for stables;  Just as I was making a rush for the mess room I ran into Arthur Welch & a friend who came out to see me;  At 9 o'clock we had the horses out on the parade ground & we were soon riding through Heliopolis & out on to theSuez Road;  I have had a touch of a sore throat this afternoon
