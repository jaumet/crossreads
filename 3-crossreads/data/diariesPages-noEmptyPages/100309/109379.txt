then to Elysee Palace Hotel and got a fine room with private bathroom for 12 francs. A great difference is noticeable in the streets as all the trees are out in full leaf. Tonight the Avenue des Champs Elysees was full of strollers and people sitting on the chairs. All the cafes were busy and crowds sitting outside. Had a walk round 
rue de Castiglione and Rue St Honore as far as the Place Vendome and then returned to hotel having a meet but it did not come off. The roar of the guns can be very clearly heard here tonight. Between Amiens and Paris there is some very beautiful country and a good deal of wood. We noticed some chateaus. Put down a good long iced drink before turning into a fine double bed. The crowds all round are uniformed and in most cases soldiers or sailors. Fountains were not playing on Place de la Concorde.
