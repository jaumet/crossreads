<p>[Drawing of Soldier]<br/>The Old Platoon</p>
<p>We'll drink a health to the Old Platoon<br/>And the men who strode along<br/>In the frosty light of a winter moon<br/>To the swing of a marching song &ndash;</p>
<p>The men who marched to the old front line,<br/>To the land of frozen dead,<br/>To the shrapnel's burst and the bullet's whine<br/>And the shell-fire overhead.</p>
<p>We'll drink a health to the men of old,<br/>To the friends that once we knew,<br/>To the vanished voice, to the heart of gold,<br/>To the comrades tried and true.</p>
<p>To the cheerful swing of a marching tune,<br/>To the tramp of marching men!<br/>Oh, drink a health to the old platoon,<br/>For we'll never march again!</p>
<p>Charles Gilmour.</p>
