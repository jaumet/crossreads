<p>24 August 1918 Saturday<br/>*Black Anzacs <strike>are what</strike> The British West Indians call themselves.<br/>Went B.H.Q. &amp; then around the line- <strike> (The Black Anzacs as they call themselves)</strike> they are a chattering lot <strike>of West Indians.</strike>  I feel the loss of my horses every time I go out- great lop-eared clumsy brutes we have now, without any pretence of blood.  Sandflys &amp; Mosquitoes bad near water but we are thankful for latter.<br/>Papers &amp; letters from England tell good news from France- may it all end soon.  Jim Ayre is still alive &amp; kicking, we old dogs seem to weather it better than many youngsters.</p>
