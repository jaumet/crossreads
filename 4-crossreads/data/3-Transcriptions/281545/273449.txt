<p>me to finish, so I brought the engine in &amp; put her away signing off at 1 am.   I was not required for duty again until Saturday at 2.30 Pm when I did a shift on the yard shunter until 10 Pm when I again signed off at 11 Pm &amp; remained off duty until  today Tuesday April 30th when I signed on at 12.30 Pm on a Banking Engine &amp; up to 4 Pm was not required so remained in the siding.   After a period of nearly three weeks of quietness, there being nothing of interest to report, as I had been dong Local Banking Work &amp; had a good time, working 8 to 10 hours at a time, I now start to relate an another somewhat startling experience.   On Friday May 17th 1918, I was booked on a run to shunt the Balloon Siding near a village called Campain &amp; left the Depot at 1.30 &amp; arrived there at 2.30 Pm &amp; as there were no work to do, we made ourselves comfortable in a shady spot as it was fairly warm.    At about 4 Pm we went over to see an Observation Balloon brought out of a Hanger, which is really a very high shed to be tested in the Air.   The O.C. went around examining the Balloon &amp; then the boys in charge of the ropes allowed it to rise &amp; the O.C. climbed into the Basket &amp; the Balloon which was also attached to a cable on a Motor Car was let up <strike>in the</strike> higher &amp; the O.C. was testing the rope gear, after satisfying himself all was correct the Balloon was returned to the hanger</p>
