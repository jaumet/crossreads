  
 (5) bought some fruit and biscuits for the journey and by 11.30 pm the time for departure was safely seated in a compartment for Edinburgh. My companions were mostly Scottish soldiers going home on leave also a very pleasantly spoken young Canadian (soldier of course) 
 After a long chat we all went to sleep or tried to do so. Unfortunately all trains had to have blinds drawn so we saw nothing of the scenery till at dim daybreak we arrived in "Mother's town" Carlisle for our morning coffee. Then on again and full daybreak found us in Scotland  traversing rather flat and uninteresting scenery till suddenly we arrived in Prince's St. Station, Edinburgh about 7.30 am 4/11/16 Failing to find anyone to meet me I went round to the King George and Queen Mary Club for Soldiers and had a fine breakfast and then took a G.P.O. tram along Prince's St. 
 Edinbugh is noted for its trams. These small double deckers are all drawn along at the same slow old rate by the cable down below.
