a chap fell over board this evening and the ship did not stop until ordered to by the escort. The cruiser picked him up after a search and he died of exposure shortly after.1st April 1916.A beautiful day and the sea is calm and marvelously blue. This ship the "Transylvania" is was once a Cunard Liner; is about 19,000 tons, and is very fast, we must be averaging 17 knots. She is carrying 3500 troops; and numerous staff including, General Sir William Birdwood; Commander of the Anzac Corps and his staff. Which may account for the fact that we are sailing alone and at such high speed. The ship steers a zig-zag course; and we wear our life belts and stand by the boats all day I am stroke oar in No.12 boat. Sighted no today.
