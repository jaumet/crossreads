February 1919
1st. My Paris pass is a long time coming through.
3rd. Paris pass arrives at last and to-morrow I will catch the Cologne-Boulogne Express as far as Arras.
4th. Leave Charleroi at 6 p.m. and travell all night in guards van.
5th. Am in Paris, but after a most awful journey of 28 hours. We took just 24 hours to get to Arras, when it was snowing heavily, but by luck I caught a train for Paris arriving there at 9.30 p.m.
