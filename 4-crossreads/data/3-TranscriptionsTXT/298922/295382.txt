 Sunday 25 February 1917 
 Arrived at ZEITOUN, mixed crowd of English &amp; other officers. 
 I took the shoes off my horses to give their feet a spell while I'm away. On the old Camel lines on the Desert a small quantity of grain, Barley &amp; LENTILS have grown up from the waste feed &amp; my man grazes the horses here, both are fat &amp; doing well.
