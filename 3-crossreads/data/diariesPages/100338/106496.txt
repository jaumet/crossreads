February 1919

very cold. The Influenza is going about a lot again, The men are dying very fast from it in the camp.

Around the camp there is a lot of Sandbagging being done, Only the other night one man was knocked down and killed and robbed, while he was walking home from Warminster to the Camp. It is not safe to be out of camp alone after dark.

Two men were caught red handed the other night.

These last two days I have had a cold on the head and chest, If the wether does not get warmer I do not know how I am to get rid of it.

On Tuesday the 18th of February I was taken very ill just after I had finished dinner, I turned into bed straight away, But as the afternoon wore on I got worse, so I decided to send for the Doctor,
