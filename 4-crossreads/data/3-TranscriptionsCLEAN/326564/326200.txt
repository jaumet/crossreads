  
 countrys good money, no wonder this war is costing so much when we carry so many drones on our backs they are a lovely crowd. The Coy were paid tonight & wherever you look gambling is going on. Saw some Tanks going across country this evening making their way to the firing line. 
 9th  Got our orders to move early this morning so we have been very busy packing up & getting our platoons ready, & billets cleaned out. There has been very heavy gunfire all last night & it is still going strong Jock has just had a streak of luck at "two up" a fair little pile Quite a number of the Coy. were absent last night from the Tattoo Call especially No 9. so things have been very busy in the Orderly Room.
