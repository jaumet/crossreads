<p>1918<br/>Tue. 23rd Apl.<br/>Another concert in evening.  Not such a good show as the last.   Asstd vaudeville followed by a pierrot-show.   (4 male &amp; 4 "female")  A couple of the "Pierrettes" were quite chic, but the others - !</p>
<p>Aubrey E. Raymond-Barker, (the name quite suits the owner) actually had the nerve to give a "baby" song attired as a pierrette!   He had neither voice nor looks, but he <u>had</u> effrontery.</p>
<p>Wed 24th.<br/>Through the farm country at the back of the lager this morning, through a now-deserted villa-farm with charmingly laid-out gardens.   The surrounding country is very sandy, though picturesque, &amp; although some rye is grown the land is chiefly devoted to timber, principally pine.</p>
<p>A long road back from the farm to the lager is bordered with cherry trees, now in full blossom.</p>
