<p>the men have been to Gallipoli. They were doing Slope &amp; Order Arms by numbers, stood by &amp; watched them for fully 15 minutes. How monotonous it must be for them,  we have no room to growl after seeing this. Some girls writing from Sydney to me, say, I suppose you are having a good time in Cairo, or some other big city, going to theatres &amp; social evenings etc., it makes one laugh to read such words as these. A soldiers life is not a bed of roses, but we all say this "this is the life". I have seen in a great number of papers from Australia, letters from soldiers of the 8th Brigade, &amp; other Units who arrived here after us. Their account of their doings in this land of "sand sin &amp; sore eyes" is most romantic, quite a number have stated that they are writing their letters in the trenches, with shells flying around them. Don't you believe all this rot, the only shells we have seen are egg shells when a native canteen is raided.</p>
<p>This ends the second edition of my diary, kept from our departure from sunny N.S.W   What numerous changes have occurred since sailing out of Sydney Harbour six months ago. We little thought then that we should still be stagnating in the dreary solitudes of this inhospitable land, far from madding crowds, &amp; where flies are our close companions.</p>
<p>Still rumours flying round that we will soon be out of this ancient land, but as we hear so many reports like this, not much notice is taken of them.</p>
