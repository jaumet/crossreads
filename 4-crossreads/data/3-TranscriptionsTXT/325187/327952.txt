 [Friday 28 July 1916] 
  The 7th L.H. ran into a bit of an ambush this morning &amp; had some casualties  the Turks keep pushing their outposts towards us in the night. Arrived back to Bivouac this morning &amp; out again tonight. This is the day we expected Johnnie Turk to attack but he has not shown up yet.  I have classed my small Kit into what I can carry &amp; what throw away &amp; am already for eventualities Scribbling these notes each day keep me in touch with you,  little Mother &amp; that far away dusty little town  &ndash; I hope you are keeping well to meet me when I come home once more.
