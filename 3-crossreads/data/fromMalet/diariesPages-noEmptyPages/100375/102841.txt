Sept 12thNot very much work doing in the D.R.
Sept 13thPacking up the C.C.S. to go to St Venant.
About five o'clock in the evening the Orderly Sgt came around and told all 1914 men to parade at the orderly room. On making inquiries of him the why and the wherefore of the parade he told us that all men who had joined up in 1914 were to go on six months furlough. We thought the whole thing a joke, but we soon learned much to our pleasure that it was quite true
Naturally there was a great deal of excitement in the camp. At eight oclock we paraded again with our packs up and mounting a Motor Lorry amid scenes of great excitement amongst those left behind, we sped on our way to Bray sur Somme a distance of 100 Kilometres There were thirty two of us along with all our gear packed into this Motor Lorry so that one can well imagine that there was not too much room to turn.
