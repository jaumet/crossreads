<p>Wed Oct 2. <br/>Muster Parade this morning, a Frenchman and two Tommies came round and tried to identify somebody, but they didn't manage it. A draft came in from Blighty this morning, and I saw Sgt Mathieson among them. I heard later that the Frenchman recognised the chap he was looking for down at the Infantry Base. It appears the the Digger went for a drive in the Frenchman's car. He gave a 5F note in payment. The Froggie pulled out his wallet to get change, and "Aussie" snatched it and ran away. It contained 90Fs.</p>
<p>Had quite a busy day in the Drying Room. Attended French class, but I'm afraid I'm too thick in the Head to learn much.</p>
<p>Thur 3. <br/>Fine day. The war news is still excellent, and I do believe that the war id drawing to an end.</p>
<p>Had another busy day in Drying Room. Got Paid yesterday, 40Fs. A Franc is getting more valuable every day now, which is a very good sign. A pound is only worth 26Fs now, before it was 27.25.</p>
<p>Bought some French Books tonight and a writing Pad. Attended concert at Y.M., a Frenchman on cello and Lady at Piano. Yank recited, very good.</p>
<p>Fri Oct 4. <br/>Nothing very exciting happened. Was pretty bust all day. After Tea went to Y.M. but as Madame did not turn up there was no French class. After I hunted round all the Canteens for Pen nibs and couldn't get any.</p>
<p>I commenced a Letter to M.S.</p>
<p>Sgt Mathieson came in and had a yarn.</p>
<p>Sat 5. <br/>Fairly busy day. "Matto" is warned for draft, so I guess he will be moving off tomorrow. The Camp is pretty full now. A big A.M.C. draft came in today, and they are 13 and 14 to a Tent, so "Bill" came and camped with me in the Drying Room.</p>
<p>Sun 6. <br/>War news continues good, Bulgaria boss "Slung in the Towel" and now Germany is squealing for Peace.</p>
<p>Went into City after Dinner. Raining. Cleared up later, and my coat became a nuisance. Had Tea at Y.M. with chap from Dentists. Bought souvenir for "Young Hook", also a number of Xmas Cards.</p>
<p>Had a sing song in Train coming back to Camp.</p>
