<p>Corps with retention of command by Birdwood. Although this re-organisation was announced on or about 15 November 1917 the Australian Corps did not come into existence officially until 1 January 1918 .<br/>When the year 1918 opened the belligerent powers could not foresee that at the close of that year hostilities in the War of 1914-18 would have ceased. But in the meantime there was to be much more death and destruction.<br/>On 16 January 1918 Lieutenant-Colonel Walter Churchus, D.S.O. (1880-1918) succeeded Lieutenant-Colonel H.D.K. Macartney in the post of Commanding Officer of 7th Brigade, A.F.A.<br/>Germany&acute;s final great offensive began two months later.
