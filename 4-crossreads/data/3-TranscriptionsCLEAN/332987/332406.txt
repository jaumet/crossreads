Two of our baloons brought down in flames.  Continuation of sports this evening.  Major Byrne taking Colonel's place, who is ill in hospital.
6-6-1918Twenty five men in wagon line sick.  Black fever.  Saw a great fight between a German plane and three of ours.  A splendid piece of work by the Hun, as brave as any man living.  Although an enemy, one must admire such men;  he did not turn tail and try to fly away, but attacked, and attacked again.  He was in a single seater with one machine gun, that fired forward, he had a bit of manoeuvring to get his gun covering his enemy.  Dived, side stepped, and looped the loop.  He forced one of our planes to land.  At last he was forced to land, slightly wounded in neck.  His plane was painted a flaring red.  It was considerably smashed up.
