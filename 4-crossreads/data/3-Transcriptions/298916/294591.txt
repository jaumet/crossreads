<p>myself in the mirror &amp; saw that I was white &amp; trembling. So soon I had wished myself an Electrical Junior &amp; cussed myself for going away from a "good job". The pictures were falling off the wall, and crockery in the pantry next the Marconi Room was rattling away &amp; crashing to the floor. Down came the clock with a crash on to the instruments &amp; next minute a bookshelf followed. I tried to sit on the chair but I could not. Getting up I walked to the door &amp; opened the port hole. Outside everything was dark except where a few lights here &amp; there showed the Coolies in oilskins &amp; sea-boots battening down the hatches. Waves were racing over the deck &amp; washing all loose gear overboard. One particularly vicious "wuff" or "milestone" the A13 struck swung the open port back on my head, at the same time racing across the deck it stove the cook's cabin in as though it were paper, &amp; almost washed them over the side. I sat down again nursing my head &amp; almost longing to founder &amp; end it quickly. I did not care if I never saw Sydney again.</p>
