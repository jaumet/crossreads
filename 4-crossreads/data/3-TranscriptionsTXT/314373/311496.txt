useful. In the evening we went to the Dandies with Ron, Keith and Billy McDougall. I happened to mention that there would be a lot of grandmothers in Perth to-morrow in order to get leave and a lady named Mrs.Tweedall, next to Keith evidently heard for she took our names and said she would write to Collins for leave to visit her.Tuesday 28/12/15  To-day I was on town picket and Keith, Bill and I got leave from Clive who was Sargent  to go to Mrs.Tweedall to tea. We did not do much all day having plenty of time off.Wednesday 29/12/15  The picket had general leave to-day and so I went to Freemantle this morning and got my mail from the boat and also had a look round the town.
