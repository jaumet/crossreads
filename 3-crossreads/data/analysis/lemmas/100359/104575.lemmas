 Tuesday 11th The Trench are well built , and a man is fair safe in ?em , as long as a big shell doe n't lob insid . The dress station in the trench is quit snug , but the dug-out for the stretcher bearer are rather too damp to be comfort Bricki and I soon "turn in " after have a look round , but we did n't get much sleep , as machin gun were pepper away all night , and the big gun fair shook the ground . I was just doze off when someth land with a thud right alongsid my head . I hop out quick and live and struck a match to discov a tin of corn beef had fallen off a crosspiec of the roof . It was a great relief . We were not troubl all night as they did n't have a singl casualti , which was a jolli good thing for all concern . Tuesday 11th Lill 's Birthday .

Saw Peter , who was have a good time sort out hand grenad . The German trench are about 2 or 3 hundr yds , away and we could see them quit plain through the periscop .

Our relief arriv about 2.30 so we hand over to them and return to our Breweri where we told our tale of "dare do " to the rest of the crowd . Then we had a good feed of stew and a good wash . Just as we start eat " Billsey " May and " Snowi " Atherton arriv back with the first casualti . A chap name Cochran of the 29th Batt . A shell made rather a mess of him . He had the honour of be the first of " Tivey 's Tourist to get hurt . Sever other case arriv dure the night , make a total of 8. One chap came in bad knock about by a machin Gun . He dash over to the German line and grab a flag from the trench parapet but they got him on his return trip . His name was Borchard , a Lth . in the 14th Battn . Wednesday 12th The gun were live all night and we got veri littl sleep. One good thing Breakfast was not till 11 , so we had a good sleep in .
