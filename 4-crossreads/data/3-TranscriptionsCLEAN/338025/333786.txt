  
 Thursday 6th September 1917 
 Put my few mules on the grass 1pm, watching mules grazing about 3pm 5 or 6 Taubes came over and dropped bombs very close to camp. Everyone got under cover and the donks I was watching took fright and galloped back to lines. I was too far away from dugout, so I got among the trees. No bombs dropped in our camp but fell very close. As it was very cloudy the guns had difficulty in picking him out.
