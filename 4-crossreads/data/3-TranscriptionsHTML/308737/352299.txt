<p>I've met any amount of Tasmanians here, &amp; all my chums of the Garrison Artillery have rolled up here.</p>
<p>There are plenty of shells flying about here every day but one is very unlucky if one gets hit out of the firing line. I was down for a swim to-day on the beach &amp; they were shelling it pretty constantly. A couple whizzed a few feet over the heads of my mate &amp; myself &amp; lobbed in the water about 20 yds. from us. We then remembered that we had to see a man about a cat, so we did not wait for the next. Well Mum this letter is strictly censored so I cant write all I'd like to. I've received all your letters &amp; photos. You cant imagine the joy of getting letters here. I'm in a very fit condition &amp; never felt better in all my life. Of course you'll have left "Orvieto" when you get this.</p>
<p>Best of love to you all darlings, &amp; dont get anxious, too much. Writing again soon<br/>Your loving boy<br/>John</p>
