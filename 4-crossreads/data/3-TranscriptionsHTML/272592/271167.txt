<p>so we will now work systematically &amp; not anyhow like it has been</p>
<p>Received our first instalment of dry socks this morning from now on while the Batt. is in the firing line every man is to have a clean &amp; dry pair of socks issued to him each day, at the same time 1 pair will be collected from him each morning we are supposed to have 1 dry pair on 1 pair in our pack &amp; another pair getting washed &amp; dryed, this will enable us to always have dry socks, &amp; we also have an issue of whale oil the feet are supposed to be smeared over with this for it prevents frost bite to a large extent &amp; anything that will do that is well worth using.</p>
