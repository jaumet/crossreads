  
 agrees with my appetite if it does make me bark a bit. Am getting as fat as a toad & (ashamed to admit) the color of a Pommie. Re the things I mentioned  in an earlier letter - I have not yet sent them on, as I am waiting an opportunity to pack & register properly. A few more of the 'old shipwrecks' blew in to-day & didn't we give them a few rubs. They've had a time of it, though, & wish they'd come with us. By the way - there's an old ruin not far from here built by one Lutegar before woad went out of fashion. Some building - flint rubble & natural cement. The one remaining window has been altered (built in) so many times that its quite a dictionary of architecture of the ages. Of course I'll  send some of the ruins along as specimens - some day I may like to recall how we cooked a chook in Lutegars castle. It's going to freeze again tonight & there's plenty snow getting ready for us somewhere. Snow is the best thing they have in this country - it covers their slush and beautifies the hideous landscapes - Thus we don't mind it any. Must post now, so au'voir - Love to yourself & all from Harry
