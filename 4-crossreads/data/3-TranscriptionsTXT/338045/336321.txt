march off to Railway Yards to await train.  At 5 p.m. exact, just as the hour was booming from the old Cathedral tower & the Grosse Horlage (the great old clock, which in days of old, sounded the curfew at 9 p.m.) we left Rouen, in the longest train I have seen & which is full of troops.  A beautifully clear moonlight & a fine view of France by night.  Passed Amiens (bombarded by the Germans last year) which is but 15 miles from the front at 11 p.m. & from here can distinctly hear the guns - roaring as if just close at hand, after which I made myself as comfortable as possible, sleeping on the floor of carriage to wake next morning at 6 a.m.
