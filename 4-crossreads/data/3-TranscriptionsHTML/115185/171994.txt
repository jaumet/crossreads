<p>P.S.<br/>How very kind of Lady Anderson Stewart to send me pictures of gum trees. They really shouldn't. I do hope they wont get lost or spoilt on the way. But I shall take the greatest care of them if they arrive. I did see the Melba book in a shop the other day &amp; debated in my self if I'd buy it and cut the gum tree pictures out &ndash; the debate ended against buying the book for "me" just now.<br/>But Mother I'm awfully touched at these kind friends thinking of me</p>
