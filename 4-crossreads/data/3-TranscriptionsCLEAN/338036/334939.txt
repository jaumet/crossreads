  
 [22nd Aug. contd] REST AREA 
 to be picked up later on by our cars.  After a very tedious march we arrived late in afternoon at our destination, a small village on the Aa River named Ouve Werquin.  After tea some of the boys went for a swim & everything was OK again.  Our billets were not too clean though so I with others slept out on the grass although I didnt have a blanket.  At about 10 pm I saw shrapnel & searchlights in the direction of St Omer & learnt that Fritz was bombing killing 8 & wounding 28.  A rather peculiar meeting took place between one of our boys (Haynes) & some people passing in a car. It appears that they were an Australian & his wife who both live at St Omer doing war work.  We are the first Australians to stay at this village, Portuguese preceding us.  People quieter than the people near the line. 
 Thursday 23rd Raining.  Walk to river with dad Worsfold [?]  Raining at night.  Slept in barn. 
 Friday 24th Raining in morning.  In the afternoon left our village with the intention of visiting town of Lumbres about 7 Kilos away.  After  3/4 hours walking came to village of [space] thence a little further thro Elnes to Lumbres which was the junction of light & heavy railways of district.
