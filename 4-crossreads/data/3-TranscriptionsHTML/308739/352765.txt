Annual Celebration of the rising of the Nile &ndash; on the Banks at Old Cairo.

Onslow accompanied party.<br/>Rock progressing well though I fear He will never be the same bright Lad again.  He is being sent back to Aus. as unfit &amp;amp; it will be a long while if ever before recovery is complete.</p>
<p>Tuesday 22 August 1916<br/>Out to see Col. Fuller.<br/>All Officers getting on well.<br/>Col. Fuller &amp;amp; others to Maddi in Car at 2-30 p.m.<br/>These Cars cost between &amp;pound;2 &amp;amp; &amp;pound;3 for a few hours, but the comfort &amp;amp; convenience is worth all if one has it to spare.  Since the bulk of the Troops have left Egypt the Cars are easily to secure, but on first arriving it was difficult to pick a spare one in the Streets.</p>
