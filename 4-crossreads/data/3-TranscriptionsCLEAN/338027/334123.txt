  
 Friday, 22 January, 1915 In the morning went for a short march & the drivers had some driving practice for the sports to-morrow.  I met with an accident and am forbidden to ride to morrow.  Afternoon was spent in preparing the sports ground. 
 The hospital and all the Aust doctors & Nurses with Ambulance Motor waggons arrived at Maadi.  They are establishing a base hospital here as The Citadel and Mena House is full. 
 At night I recited and got a great reception at a concert given by the S. Aust Light Horse to the residents of Maadi. 
 Saturday, 23 January, 1915 The sports were a great success, I could not compete but lent my pony "Sammy" to a mate.  We had the despatch and won easily, but unfortunately he could not pull Sammy up in time to hand his despatch over.  I wrote a full report that will appear in Monday's Egyptian Mail.  B Section won the aggregate only the minor races going to A. 
 We hear that when we move we are going to split and work separately.  It will make things more satisfactory & stop the [indecipherable].
