<p>30.8.16<br/>Wed 30th<br/>Went over to the YMCA tonight &amp; received the surprise of my life when I saw Mr James YMCA Sec come hobbling along with an American who speaks like a Yank &amp; is attached to the YMCA in the Ezbekieh Gardens (Cairo) &amp; as James took French leave to visit us before he went to England &amp; the Yank came with him, James received a great reception here &amp; was kept busy till a late hour as he brought all the latest news from the Aus Gen Hosp. (3rd) at Cairo, of the lads who were wounded here; We have decided to go over the battlefield tomorrow morning, but I think James is foolish to do much work yet as his leg is far from well, it is rumored tonight that our trip to Alexandria is off</p>
