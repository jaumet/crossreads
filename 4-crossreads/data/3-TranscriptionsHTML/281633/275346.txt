<p>As one travels North the Girls seem to get broader &amp; squarer in face &amp; Build.</p>
<p>25/12, Xmas Day<br/>It snowed last night for the first time this winter.  We received no rations yesterday.  I suppose that was part of the Xmas festivities.  We have been much worse off for rations since the war has ended.  A Tommy R.E. repairing the Bridge here told me that Fritz destroyed 1370 Bridges in his retreat.  Some of the 13th Light Horse are Billeted here.</p>
<p>30/12<br/>500 Hun prisoners came here to work today.  Our fellows conducted a very successful dance at the Cinema Hall last night.  Any residents who associated with the Huns while they were here were barred.  The Rations still continue to be rather elusive.  I had a look at a big marble works today.</p>
<p>New Years Day, 1-1-19<br/>Attended dance at Cinema Hall, the Girls here dance pretty well but very few of them can reverse.  There was an awful crowd.</p>
<p>Saturday 4/1/19<br/>I visited the Central Station today.  It was well worth looking at.  It contains two 5000 K.W. Turbo-Generators, Two 3000 K.W. Turbo-Generators, old type and one 2,250 K.W. modern type with Auxiliaries, Switchboards, Bench Boards, etc.  It supplies Jeumont, Maubeuge with light &amp; power and parallels with another Station at Valenciennes.  The residents gave us a Dance in the Evening.  The music</p>
