I see the 1st &amp; 4th Divisions have just put up another splendid stunt &amp; the papers are giving our splendid troops great praise, I wonder how Len is getting on he will be in all this heavy fighting.<br/>21st.  Nothing much doing today it being Saturday &amp; I have had a very light Dental list<br/>Went for a stroll this evening &amp; for the first time in England had to wear a top coat the evenings are getting very chilly now &amp; the wind</p>
