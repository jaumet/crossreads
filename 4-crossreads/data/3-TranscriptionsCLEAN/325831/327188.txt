My dear Ferguson
I congratulate you on your letter of the 26th instant, which confirm the chat we had here a day or two ago. I feel that you have chosen well. I also feel it will have the full endorsement of your father & mother, notwithstanding the frame of mind they must naturally be in over their losses.
I wish you very complete success, which I venture to think you are going to achieve. Remember to let me know if at any time I can do anything for you, & at all times I shall be glad to meet you.
Truly yours,
R. McC. A.
