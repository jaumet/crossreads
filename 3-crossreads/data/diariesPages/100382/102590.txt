March 1916
it was not till about 1-30am the next morning before we got into the train. The train was a fair length had 1st 2nd 3rd class carriages I was lucky enough to have a 1st class. There was about fifteen hundred men on the train eight in each compartment with our equipment there was not much spare room. 
The French railway stations are different to ours for they are only raised about a foot from the ground not near as finished off as our own. We passed through the wine growing area there are some fine scenes to for the grapes are grown up the slopes on top of the hills and mountains. Fruit is also in abundance at this time of the year all the trees, vines hedges are beginning to get their leaves everything is green As you While passing through among the mountains snow could still be seen of the tops of some it was a great sight. As you go north you get into pastoral country now all the young crops are showing their heads look well. France seems to be a net work of roads rivers the roads are made of white metal with green fields it makes a grand scene. The train took us within a few miles of Paris then branched off we were all disappointed for we were wanting alook at Paris
