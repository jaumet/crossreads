first Train at about 9.30 Pm when all hands had a spell. At about 10 Pm it was Moonlight the air was very clear, as we all expected Jerry over with his Bombing Machines any moment was not disapointed, as soon the Church Bells started ringing out the warning for everybody to take cover I could see the Search Lights up in all directions looking for Jerry shells exploding in the Air. All of a sudden a great explosion took place away about 5 miles which I knew in a moment was the Dump at Campain. It was a great sight the Fire lit up the sky all around soon a number of Jerry's Machines came over my word they gave the Dump what Oh with their Bombs. I could see several Machines flying about our Anti Air Craft Guns were banging away at them, when a Machine got away from the Flare was picked up by the Search Lights, there was in an instant a great Aerial Display, shells exploding all around lights going up like skyrockets you could hear the Machine Gun Rat Tat also the Fire from Jerry who was firing down in return with his Machine Gun. Jerry would be passed on from one Search Light to another, all the time being under a Terrific Fire you could see hear the Explosions of the Bombs he was dropping. Where I was on top of a Hill it was like a grand Stand View. This display
