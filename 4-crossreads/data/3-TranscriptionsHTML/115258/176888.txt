<p>My dear Father No more mail in here yet since the last we got down in at Jericho on the 6th May; but stray letters are starting to float round here so we are &nbsp;expecting the mail any time now. A letter has just come from Alan dated 9th April and he mentions that Mother is still in Sydney - but suppose I&#39;ll get all the news tomorrow. I am afraid this letter will be a bit late for it, Father, but I must wish you many happy returnes of your birthday, and more and more successes with the Corriedales! I hope you got that &quot;Power of Attorney&quot; OK. I posted it last week under registered envelope. I got my signature witnessed by the C.O. as there is no J.P. in the regt now. We are still camped in the same place down below Bethlehem, and I&#39;m glad to say the weather is getting much warmer, in fact spring seems to be quite on now, and we are all admiring the fresh green of the grape vines growing along the terraces round</p>
