<p>328<br/>V."s so far lent me &ndash;<br/>A Compleat Rosetti, Adam Lindsay Gordon, Child Harold"s Pilgrimage, Sax Rohmer"s "The Yellow Claw" &amp; "The Two Paths" of Ruskin"s.  Haven"t seen her for some time and don"t want to.</p>
<p>329  Nov. 25<br/>Tonight, when I"ve a hundred entries &ndash; one.  Walking from Boulogne, confidences with Harry after an afternoon and evening spent together, the pleasantest evening since Jake went away, and an evening compensating for the changes and disappointments since the morning of the 21.</p>
<p>To make this entry, unpacked for this journal my pack.</p>
<p>330  Nov. 27<br/>The history of a Transfer &ndash; Applied for it with Smith about 3 months ago, and on the morning of the 21 last, the day Jake left for Flanders, it came through.  Smith discovered the weather to be far too cold, and our unfitness:  so the transfer was held up.  Thompson was ready to take his place, and paraded yesterday, we were given men from details to instruct into the importance of ward work, we were to leave today, and today after chasing up half the unit officials discovered our movement order was for tomorrow at 9.30 a.m., and here it stands.</p>
<p>331<br/>Dinner last night of [indecipherable] existence with Aristophanes, Petronius, Sanctorius, Apuleius, Rabelais and Boccaccio.</p>
<p>332<br/>Big batch of letters from home dated Oct. 25 back to 3 Sep.  Letters yesterday from Fred Pinnock in 1st L.H.F.A. and from 14 F.Amb., ten chaps asking for transfer to here, one chap strange to say, by name Molony:  passed letter on to Allan.</p>
<p>333<br/>Out to Flanders the afternoon (intention) to see Jake.</p>
<p>334<br/>V. showed me that particularly "chosen pieces" in Rosetti &ndash; when she thought I"d be gone in the morning.  It was "A Virgin declares her Beauty" and more after Swinburne"s manner than anything I"ve read.</p>
<p>335<br/>Longueval, Dec. 14<br/>Tonight we"re out of the line, and back at the F.D.S. after 10 days at the Aid post at Bulls Trench, N. Flers.</p>
<p>"Shall we not say of a murderer" asks Montague, "that he has a handsome leg?"  Flers a ruin on the top of a little rise, shell shattered and filled with dead trees and bodies, from where we were, mostly towards evening, was a fantastick yet weirdly beautiful position.  On the hillock ridge, to us it presented a silhouette of dead tall trees, sharp as etching lines, broken by an occasional abrupt rising stark piece of heavy walling.  The foreground, ploughed through by saps and trenches, filled with shell holes, a rich brown midden, with an occasional relief of tiny escaped patches of green grass.</p>
<p>336<br/>Some gems, heard one night, while Bib was finishing a term just at the [indecipherable] north of our dugout.  Bib"s hair at night looked something like the witch of Endor as seen through the eyes of a budding Bairnsfather.  The cookhouse (?) being so exposed, the entrance that is, made it something in the nature of a general inquiring office for the 10 and 12 Batts.</p>
<p>Casual writers and Bib, were responsible for more Red Page literature than Adams has ever been.</p>
<p>"Who looks after the dump mate?"<br/>"Dun know! &ndash; Looks after itself &ndash; an" got blown up yesterday!"<br/>"10th Batt?"<br/>"Yes!"<br/>"Come on then, Keep touch, Keep Touch!"<br/>"Keep Touch be ---!  I don"t care &ndash; if I never saw the &ndash; again."</p>
