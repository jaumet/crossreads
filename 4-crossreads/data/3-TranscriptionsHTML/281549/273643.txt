<p>Frenchmen were commandeered by the Germans &amp; the contents used for making the soup, which was served out to everybody in camp. This continued all the while I was in Konigsmoor Lager.</p>
<p>The work that I did while I was here, was sorting Potatoes, We were to separate the bad potatoes from the good ones, The good ones were then buried in the earth to protect them from the frost of the comming winter, We had a Sentry watching us to see that we did it properly, &amp; watch that no bad ones were put amongst the good, but every time he turned his back on us, we would put a bucket full of bad ones on top of the good ones &amp; cover them over with straw. In all probability when they dug them up to use them they would find them mostly bad.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the 10th July I left Konigsmoor Camp together with 6 other Englishmen &amp; 5 Frenchmen. We caught the 8.30 am train from Konigsmoor Railway station to Gnarrenburg arriving  there at about 4 o'clock  pm. From Gnarrenburg</p>
