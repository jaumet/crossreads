 7-7-16 Fri 7th Last night a dozen lads from this Regt went over to the YMCA &amp; commenced to build the stadium, afterwards had a few songs &amp; then came back to bed;  At 9.30 this morning we had to take all our horses to Railhead to give them a drink of fresh water as there was some over in a large tank which they wanted emptied.  water is laid on to Railhead from Katara:
