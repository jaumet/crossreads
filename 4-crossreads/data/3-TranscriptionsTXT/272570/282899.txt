Thursday 1 August 1918(Diary continued from book completed) "for you call us Sambo? I told him I didn't know, nothing in particular & he said " I don't qualify with that at all, Sambo means a monkey." We were amused. I told him we didn't know that, & I didn't mean to hurt his feelings, he said " It does not matter, it does not worry me, you call me Sambo, I answer just the same, but I don't qualify with it at all," & the coon puffed at a cigarette & put on great swank. One travels & learns alright. I had a good snooze after dinner & am feeling a bit livelier than last night. Fritz 'planes came over & set fire to 4 of our balloons this evening. There is a hayfield in front of our dugout & two women are grafting hard; & stacking it in heaps. Of course our chaps helped themselves to some when they had gone, as a bed for their dugouts. 2 Aug.Rained all day. 3 Aug,Had a tooth filled today, the dental party had to go to the 4th Field Ambulance, there was a motor ambulance going there, as it was a long way - passed through Camon, Longueau & Cagny, all now deserted of their civilian population.
