The "Royal George" with Indian troops, which arrived yesterday, proceeded through the Canal this morning & the "Star of Victoria" arrived in port at about 9 a.m.  I may state here that   I was not sorry to leave the ship, although we have had a wonderful voyage & like most of the troops, have enjoyed it well.  The weather here is moderately cool & the last two nights have been very cool, different to what we have had the other part of the voyage. 7th   This is Sunday & we are still at Tel-el-Kibir.  The weather is very dry & hot during the day & cold at night.  The camp is a very large one & we have about 800
