Such was our view that we could look right up the Ancre valley to Albert. On the opposite bank we saw Ribemont, Buier, Hanacourt, & Albert, while on our side were Treux & away on the sky line - the Morlancourt battlefield. The first mentioned villages were knocked about but recognisable, but as we looked further away the country became more desolate until Albert appeared as a patch of ugly which on a blue grey background; beyond the Treux as a red & white collection of (apparently) bricks; & Morlancourt as a bare hill with one or two tree stumps. Over the latter shells were falling often: I think a stunt is on over there.
Shrapnel & high explosive were falling from time to time further up the main road towards Bray.
