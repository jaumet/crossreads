We all thought that it was a holiday and it was not so we had to go to school which I don't like neither does Frank.</p>

I might go to <strike>Sunday</strike> Church to day but I don't know.  My Wattle is lovly on the trees and on Frank's to.  And Oh we have such nice times and the shelf on the fire it looks nice and so does the fire.  Both of us slept with Mum last night it was my turn to sleep with mum.
