 So I let fli . I fed the blaze with faggot ? Hint that on the whole we like the Hun ? Rough out a sketch of charnel-heap and maggot ? The side of war that is n't sport nor fun ; Flung a few phrase chosen from the camp At itch-struck femal dash about in car To pose in sketchi frill at snide bazaar ? At fat old profit and statesmen 's ramp ? Oh , yes ! I pile it on . He loath the pill , And barg his way out , rosi round the gill . But was the swine half-right ? It sound like bliss To sleep seren o ?night without surmis Of S.O.S. light scream to the sky , Deep in the warmth of Blighti out of this ? It sound like bliss to forget the dug-out 's reek The bitter fog in the eye ; the life on a thread , The craze crescendo of the mortar seek Half-cal live and the unheed dead , And drows in everlast furlough , under The placid roof of peace-tim . Well , I wonder ! If we get through it ? if the Immortal choos To grant a span again , when this be end , Of order life , impenetr fend By small restraint and sanction and taboo ? Shall the recov care and leisur grip The flabbier soul , or shall desir return Back to the dug-out 's care-fre comradeship And battle-tim 's magnific unconcern For dim to-morrow ? Shall we find , onc more , Peac has it surfeit too as well as War ? Not the drab shadow onli we ll rememb , But all the colour there was ? the brown and blue Down the deep shaft of Flemish avenu ; The sway harvest gold-drench with Septemb ; And frosti morn in the Spring retreat When the scrap open out , and it was good To choos a gun-park in the green wheat And pitch a hidden tent in Holnon Wood ? Jimmi , old son , it made the puls danc To see those Devon daffodil in Franc ! We shall recal the eager clank and jingl Of gun-team on the pave , move South , The long off-saddl in the mid-day drouth , " Feed " in the cowslip by the waysid dingl ; The journey 's welcom end amid the cool Clutter of sun-warm barn and straggl pine ; The urgent fuss around the wagon-lin ; Sweat-roughen hors drink at the pool ? And then the morn start , with head-chain ring Swing along at eas , the driver ? sing . . . And moment better still , I thank the god For one white , perfect hour at Contevill , With Boch mass on the nearer hill , And open sight as near as make no odd . Young grant was with us then . The boy was daft , Blind to sniper , yell like the damn : Young Grant was with us then . The boy was daft , Of three-rounds-gunfir . Then left section jam , And back the buzzer ? privat signal roll : Sweat on it , chum ! We ve got the bastard cold ! Such memori blaze their imprint under the trace Of darker record on the palimpsest . The blacker the time the deeper bite the zest Of sudden sunshin on the open space . There 's a rough justic finger the scale Where greater guerdon risk the longer price ? Hazard your neck , and savour your cake and ale ? Seek Eden-fruit , and stake your Paradis . For though smooth road 's good go , Jim ? a kiss Snatch at the edg of Hell is tenfold bliss . One thing is sure . This crazi round-about Destroy the introspect attitud . Action uproot the dreami Hamlet-mood , And blith cut the yellow throat of Doubt . Your job is clear befor you , catalogu From dawn to dawn . You cannot miss the green , Slice as you will ? the fairway lie undog By furtiv may-be-so and might-have-been ? Flank unto flank no hesit ghost The crude command of Corp Direction-Post . Leav it at that , then . On your toe , old son ! Still with a grin for plagu we ca n't abolish ? The super-fat Staff ; the wili Hun ; The Armi 's tribal god of Spit-and-Polish . Blight seiz ?em all ! I ll wander now and borrow A coupl of blanket from the R.T.O. , You can doss down with me an hour or so . We ll trek togeth to the gun to-morrow . Finish your swipe , old Jimmi , while you can ? Walk ? March ! The bloom ride ! Bonn chanc , Suzann ! L.M. Hast .
