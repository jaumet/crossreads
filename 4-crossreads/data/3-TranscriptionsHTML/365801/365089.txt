<p>Well I think I have blown out of news, &amp; don't know what to write to the others now.  Give them all my love.  I hope you have had more than one spell like the short one at Tarella &amp; that the Pater keeps going along steady. [Four lines deleted].<br/>I asked Kingy to send a cable to you when he went to London but havnt seen him since he came back.  I havnt had any cables since I got to France, evidently since I cabled &amp; it was posted as they all are to England you all rushed to the conclusion I was knocking about there, instead of going straight into the line.  I am not very keen about leave plenty in the battery to interest me.  I hope all you folks are O.K.<br/>My love to them all.<br/>Affectionately,<br/>Geoff</p>
