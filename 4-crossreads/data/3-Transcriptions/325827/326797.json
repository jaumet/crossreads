<p>4<br/>lectures on my return. Whether that will come off or not I do not know. I will see when she comes and talk it over with here. Expense is tough with photography in Egypt and a great number of slides would have to be taken.<br/>Living is dear here.  A  1/- book in England costs 1/5. Magazines are about 3 more than in England. Clothes and food also. Board in a decent boarding place or "Pension" will cost &pound; 2/-/- to &amp;pound: 2/10/- a week for the bare thing.<br/>Cloudy today &amp; looks like rain &ndash; My roof is still holey. So is the floor to let the water out again.<br/>Love to all.<br/>Rid</p>
