<p>March 2nd 1919</p>
<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>Again rain and added a cutting wind suggestive of snow.  Dodging the showers I rode to Anzac beach and did a topographical pencil drawing of a likely background for a landing picture.  The wind tried to tear the paper out of the book and my hands <strike>wh</strike> were nearly "fruz" so * "Bokra fil mich miche" as usual.  In the afternoon I mounted a new horse lent by the Division at Chanak, a good Irish hunter &amp; rode over to Hughes' camp &amp; back at a hard gallop up &amp; down hill &amp; across obstacles;  this ride restored interest in life and I <u>believe</u> the horse enjoyed it, though I <u>hate the human</u> presumption that fastens thought to dumb animals.  Late afternoon I did a water colour of the first of a series of bushes &amp; plants which I think should be recorded, a study of "Arbutas", that I believe is the name, rather a wax like leaf with a sort of blossom something like a laurel but with red <strike>res</strike> stalks or sticks.</p>
<p>You are about due for your first separation allowance and<br/>[Drawing]<br/>* (Tomorrow when the apricots appear!)</p>
