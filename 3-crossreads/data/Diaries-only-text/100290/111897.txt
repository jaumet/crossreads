Tuesday
A rumour spread this morning that a transport very near us was torpedoed by An Austrian submarine. Awoke with sore throat. Feel a cold coming on.
Come in view of Marseilles at 3.30 p.m. . our goal. Spirit of thankfulness that we have come thus far safely prevails. First impressions: ? Stately light-house uprearing out in the sea off the coast. ? An immense chateau dominates the town. very striking from the sea. ? A convent I found out after, surmounted by a great brass statue on top of a high tower. blinking glittering in the setting sun. just as one reads about. Enter the docks about 6 p.m. moor to a buoy in the stream. First sight of French soldiers. Red pants. old style uniform.
