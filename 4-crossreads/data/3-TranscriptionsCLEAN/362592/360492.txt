  
 The Mercenaries. 
 These, in the day when Heaven was falling, The hour when earth's foundation fled, Followed their mercenary calling And took their wages - and are dead. Their shoulders held the sky suspended, They stood, and earth's foundations stay: What God abandoned these defended, And saved the soul of things - for pay. 
 Housman.
