 30/10/17 Rome Vendome column at Paris. Bought a ticket for Carmen tonight. After lunch went up to the Quirinal hill and had a look at the Quirinal palace &ndash; an ordinary building. From here a good view is to be had. From here we drove down to the Baths of Caracalla, a gigantic mass of ruins. It is an enormous place of brick and the swimming baths and the different chambers are still clearly visible. The floor and walls were all mosaiced, and portions even yet are intact. The arches and high overhanging walls cannot fail to impress one. When it was in full repair it must have been a wonderful place. There used to be a stadium adjoining. Saw the place where the Rape of the Sabines took place and then set out for the Appian way and the Catacombs of S Calixtus.
