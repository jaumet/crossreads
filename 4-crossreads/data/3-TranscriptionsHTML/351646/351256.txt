<p>The Tin Dish<br/>Dear Guy,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.12*1914<br/>To begin a note, which I hope to continue more<br/>regularly&#149;<br/>We left Sydney on the Friday as I expect you know &amp; called in at Brisbane for an hour or two on Sunday. We are now proceeding. We have an extra officer with us just out from England &amp; big ships &amp; his lucid exposition of his ideas on the comforts of Destroyers as homes keeps the rest of us feeling fairly comfortable, though we are not happy as it's an uncomfortable trip. The first night he slept in the chart room and got most of the charts &amp; flags down on him. Next he tried the Wardroom bunk and after being hurled across the deck three times gave it up and tried to doze off in a chair. Having just succeeded in this he was rudely awakened by a rifle being pitched out of the rack onto his head. Personally ve been getting very hungry as food is evasive, and my dreams &#151; when successful in getting to sleep &#151; deal mostly with good chops &amp; steaks on a firm table flanked by steady chair -- also a good chair on the Verandah at home out of sight of water. There is some chance of a scrap soon;<br/> m afraid it may be a landing party job when I&acute;ll probably be left behind though I'm trying to work the Oracle. But the Engineer Officer is supposed to stay by the ship &amp; also the Captain, tho the latter sometimes loads his own dice.<br/>3.12.14<br/>To continue:<br/>Nothing of note has happened since last page: last night we got into smooth water &amp; anchored for the night at a very pretty little spot -- I wish I could name places as it would make it much easier to write letters. In the morning we were off at day break &amp; just before we left the quacking of ducks made us very sorry we couldn't land &amp; do some shooting. It's very interesting country up here &amp; I'd like to explore it; high hills &amp; thickly wooded &amp; big rivers &#126; I'll be able to tell you all about it after we leave these parts. If the rainfall is regular it must be very fertile; I expect big money will come from it before many years. Just before leaving Sydney I got a .22 pistol &amp; 1000 cartridges &amp; now I've rigged a little range on the foc'sle &amp; fire at about 15 yards at a target about 6 inches square &#151; it doesn't sound hard but with the ship rolling &amp; pitching &amp; a light pistol to hold in the wind it takes a good try - - for me &#151; to get all six shots in the target. It's almost the only way of passing time except reading &amp; if I do manage to get ashore with a party, &amp; the Captain has promised to take me if he can, I may be glad of the practise. We anchor again soon I think, it's very hot incidentally &amp; one feels like a newly filled waterbag &#151; and looks the same.</p>
