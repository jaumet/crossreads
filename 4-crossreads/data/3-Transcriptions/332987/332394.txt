<p>Scottish regiments going into the line.</p>
<p>25-5-1918<br/>According to prisoners captured by us, Mont Des Cats, which is just in rear of our position, is supposed to be taken by the enemy today.  So far, 8-30 a.m., it is still ours.  The Huns were to use a new gas.  Hundreds of Scotch passed by here last evening.  Kilted regiments.  Made and put a pair of bar shoes on W.O. Fitzsimmons' horse, under V.O. instructions.  Very bad quarter crack. In fact one inside quarter the piece had to be cut away, hanging by a thread.  One of our horses suffering from Tetanus.  The day is fine but cloudy.</p>
<p>26-5-1918<br/>The horse suffering from Lock jaw, destroyed this morning at 7-30.  This horse had a bolt run into its foot, about a fortnight ago.  My horse run over by a motor wagon, crushing the inside of his off hind foot, the wheel of wagon went between his hind legs.  He was always frightened of motor traffic.</p>
