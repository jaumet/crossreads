Cairo . Personal.[This page crossed through.]Here I am again at Continental. Stored KIT at Gezireh - sent Cables to you, Mother & the wife saying "I'm off first boat". Got Circular NOTES from Thos. Cook & Co. for use en route, reported at A.I.F. Headquarters for instructions & PAPERS & now await Orders to report to Embarkation Office, Alexandria - no information is given to anyone, as to when or what boats are to sail. Rang up NOWELL & asked him to dine with me tonight. He's at ABBASSIA, a suburb in charge of Camel BASE CAMP.
