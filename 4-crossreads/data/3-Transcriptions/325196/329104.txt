<p>4-2-16<br/>Fri 4th<br/>Mounted drill as usual today &amp; this afternoon our team had an easy win over the 1st Welsh miners winning by 18 points to three; The 2nd L.H. were beaten by the Welch R.A.M.C. the scores being 3 to nil; A canteen is now opened for the 1st L.H. Bde &amp; there is some dissatisfaction on account of them charging us dearer prices for goods than what they charge the Welch Tommies, both canteens are run by the same people &amp; they refuse to serve us at the Tommies canteen. Our Brigadier (Col Cox) was brought to the canteen last night to see if anything could be done to fix the matter up; I expect to see the canteen come down some day if it is not a little more reasonable</p>
