<p>Mametz<br/>10/4/17<br/>was there with the D.A.D.O.S. and some of their figures regarding stores &amp; were particularly illuminating.  After they had done the General came in and we had a discussion on our attack of a few days since over some afternoon tea.  Our argument lasted until 6 so I phoned to Spiller to carry on with the mess.  Pedler walked back with us &amp; we found that Major Parkes &amp; Dr Campbell Smith had already dined and all hands were on the way to the concert which had been well organised by Capt Alderson.  Every item was excellent &ndash; the voices were good and there were no duds.  A large audience &ndash; the men all fresh and smiling and looking fit.  Their minds well off the War.  Stewart returned from leave today and he brought me my new tunic.  Ella sent a splendid parcel of chocolate from Paris.  Fierce arguments re the War &ndash; all consider USA entrance must shake the Hun up</p>
