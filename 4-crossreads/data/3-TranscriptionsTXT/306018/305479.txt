January 1918Have had a couple of games of football here & find the game very strenuous for one who has got so soft here.  Have been to a couple of dances at the British Recreation Club & enjoyed myself immensely.  I did not know there were so many girls here & most of them are English too.  Had a weekend in Alexandria over the 20th & while there called in at Records GHQ to find out how cousin Willie was as I had received no reply to my letter.  They told me he had been killed in action near Jerusalem on the 23rd November.  I was very sorry to hear the news & got all the particulars I could.I went up to the 15th Gen Hosp & saw Sister Barrow & Nurse Averinos.  I had lunch with all the nurses, felt quite conspicuous surrounded, being the only man in about 50 of them.  After lunch we went out for a drive
