<p>11 SUNDAY</p>
<p>Fine but came up rain &amp; mist</p>
<p>in the evening. Cleaning</p>
<p>harness all day. Our half</p>
<p>holiday was postponed</p>
<p>till Wednesday on account</p>
<p>of the C.R.A coming round</p>
<p>tomorrow &amp; we had to clean</p>
<p>up everything. A Hun plane</p>
<p>came over &amp; got the baloon</p>
<p>near here. He had three or</p>
<p>four goes at it with a</p>
<p>machine gun &amp; finally</p>
<p>set it alight &amp; got away.</p>
