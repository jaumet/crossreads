 31 THURSDAY 
 Fine &amp; warm. Working round the 
 pit all day filling sandbags ect. 
 I was firing&nbsp;on some stunts 
 all afternoon. Did S.O.S. Guard 
 at night &amp; then pit guard after. 
 We had a fire in the pit 
 in afternoon &amp; it burnt a lot 
 of our camel fly &amp; sandbags 
 but did no further damage. 
 I fired my first shot out of 
 an 18 pounder. Fritz sending 
 over a few, but did not do 
 much damage. we&nbsp;were 
 sending them over all day 
 in one stream. Fritz got a dump 
 behind us at night
