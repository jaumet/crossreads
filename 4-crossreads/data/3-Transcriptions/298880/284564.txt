<p>to a lovely Xmas as the boys will get their mail &amp; their parcels to say nothing of the "plonk" (Rum) &amp; beer &amp; wine which I can see even now flowing freely. It has been rotten here on the Somme to say the least of it &amp; we shall be very glad when we are out of it.</p>
<p>23rd Dec.</p>
<p>We were relieved from the trenches on 21st by the 20th Bn 2nd Div. Stayed the night at Bernafay Huts and entrained next morning in open trucks. We got out at Meaulte &amp; marched to Blurre in all the glory of steel helmets sheep skin jackets &amp; mud from head to heel. A large number of parcels were given out I received a Xmas parcel from my friends in England.</p>
