<p>My dear Ferguson</p>
<p>I congratulate you on your letter of the 26th instant, which confirm the chat we had here a day or two ago. I feel that you have chosen well. I also feel it will have the full endorsement of your father &amp; mother, notwithstanding the frame of mind they must naturally be in over their losses.</p>
<p>I wish you very complete success, which I venture to think you are going to achieve. Remember to let me know if at any time I can do anything for you, &amp; at all times I shall be glad to meet you.</p>
<p>Truly yours,</p>
<p>R. McC. A.</p>
