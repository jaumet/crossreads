[Letter from Brig. General Charles Rosenthal]Head Quarters9th Aust. Inf. BrigadeApril 19th 1918
My dear Mr GarlingI was dreadfully shocked to hear yesterday that your son Terence had died of wounds.Though expressions of sympathy at such a time may seem and are unavailing I should like you and Mrs Garling to know how very sincerely I mourn his loss with you.From what I knew of him and from what you have told me in your letter you have lost a splendid son, I have lost a personal friend, and the A.I.F. a very gallant Soldier.
I am sure that in your grief the knowledge that he laid down his life for his country and a just cause will keep & sustain you and your wife.
As you are doubtless aware I have for some months been with the Infantry so for some time past have had no opportunity of seeing your son.
Please accept my kindest regardsVery Sincerely Yours
Charles Rosenthal
