<p>the road could be seen men &amp; officers footing it but quite cheerfully, the advance being the tonic. We are now 30 miles from Amiens where we started on August 8th.</p>
<p>Saturday 7th Sept.<br/>Still standing to, waiting for orders. Improved the dugout during the morning &amp; made it watertight &amp; then had a real good rest for the remainder of the day. Several Fritz planes over during the day but very high. Observation balloons creeping up the line must have gone forward since yesterday, practically no cases coming through, 6 passing through the 8th in 24 hours, one of them being our man, for the sector. Beautiful warm weather.</p>
<p>Sunday 8th Sept.<br/>Rain at intervals during the day. Apparently we are not going to open up a dressing station here as today I received orders to hand over to the 8th my supply of dressings etc. This means that my division is being relieved by the 4th Div. which came up in buses last night. We built a mess during the day &amp; improved one dugout the rain finding a few cracks.</p>
