<p>find out amongst themselves. At last it was decided to give a demonstration of how to work a wireless station. There was a partly dismantled 1&frac12;  Kw. Telefunken station on this floor so it was decided to operate this station. The class was distributed around the set in the form of a semi-circle &amp; the Marconi operator in charge proceeded to explain how to start the alternator.</p>
<p>Each &amp; in turn then started the alternator &amp; numerous fuses were blown by unexperienced handling. At times the machinery threatened to tear itself to pieces as they run at a very high speed &ndash; about 1800 revs per min. This was the extent of the instruction received &amp; left a lot to be learned by those who had never seen a wireless station.</p>
<p>Of course our friend Mr Knowall was there amongst the operators &amp; gave his advice etc. etc. which was altogether wrong at times, &amp; threatened to ruin any wireless set that was treated as he advised.<br/>Communication between the different branches of Marconi House, is carried on by a Morse Sounder &amp; of course anything being sent by this instrument was open to be read by those who could.<br/>It was after five weeks in the class that the long waited for message was heard on the sounder</p>
