Fine & cool wind blowing. Fixing
up horselines, harness hooks ect
& exercising horses in the morning
& cleaning harness in afternoon.
They are having one section
on duty per day to take up
amunition ect so we will
only be going up one day in

of firing done during the day
but no shells came near us.
