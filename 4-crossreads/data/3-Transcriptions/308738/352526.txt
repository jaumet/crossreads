<p>Oct. 7 Thursday 1915<br/>Working all day, had a long walk through the By Streets &amp; lanes of Alexandra. The narrow streets simply swarm with humanity &amp; one wonders how in years to come they are going to exist. Spent an hour or two watching the cargo boats being loaded with sundries for the Dardinelles. The warf  is filled with every article one can think of for the comfort &amp; protection of the soldiers.</p>
