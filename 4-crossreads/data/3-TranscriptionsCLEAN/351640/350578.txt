  
 theatre of war in Europe.  My mind, as my eyes were upon them, could not help formulating the question - How many of these brave men with their horses and guns, will see Australia? - Few there be who realise the gravity of the struggle into which they may shortly be launched.  For months they have listened to the booming of guns, have seen the smoke of the powder, and have been told the effect of the exercises.  But none of them has been hurled against them, from the guns of an angry & well trained foe, shot & shell, designed to land amongst them carrying death and wounds through the atmosphere.  It is well that they are, "absent minded beggars who have heard their country's call", because were they otherwise mentally ballanced the gravity of the task before them might render less happy the remainder of their lives.  In me there is every confidence that when the Australian soldier is tested 'twill be found that the mettle of his ancestor is in him and that he will ring true to his breeding.  God bless him! 
 The happenings of the past two months lead me to the following conclusion: -  German Bill & his generals have endeavoured to deal a steading blow against the Russian with the hope that by it his hosts will be so paralysed that the Teuton strength may be moved to the Western theatre of war, there during the coming summer months to be applied with full vigour against the fighting men of England and France. - You know with what respect I have always held the Kaiser and his trained armies.  Not that I love him but because the length of their training and their finished appearance, has always impressed me, with the fear that our side have underrated his aggressive and staying powers.  Of course our Empire must win.  But when?
