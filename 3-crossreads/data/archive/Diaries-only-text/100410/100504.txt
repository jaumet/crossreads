Contemptible ? you're scarcely right;
Not mnumerous ? that's true!
Nor good at talk, but when we fight
More than enough for you.
 The Women's Share 
Not ours the greater glory, or the praise,
Not ours the danger, Lord, nor yet the pain,
Although we share in all of these in ways
Which seem ordained for women to sustain.
Ours but the waiting part, and ours to give,
To patiently endure, without a word;
And, if our dearest die, 'tis ours to live
Though death may be a thousandfold preferred.
The history of our times wont mention us,
'tis so indeed that we would have it be;
Let men have all that may seem glorious,
Let us but feel our part is known to Thee.
