<p>30.5.16 Bull ring at 8 A.M. We weren't really wanted but our N.C.O's made a hash of things as usual. First part of morning route march on main north road towards Neuve Chatelle. It had been raining slightly and made marching pleasant as it was dull. Passed through Camiers and on to La Touquet crossing the railway line where a French reserve man presented arms to us in their peculiar style. Halted at an open space at La Touquet for about 20 minutes and the instructor gave us a lecture on prevailing trench conditions here. All instructor sergeants are returned men who have been right through it and are thoroughly experienced and supposed to be here for a rest. The villages though small are very interesting and old fashioned and Camiers possesses a fine new church with a clock tower. Statues of the Crucifixion were in several places and old church rites seem to be prominent. The road is very pretty going through fine avenues with wooded country on either side and we all enjoyed it. The Engineers led back. I was leading corporal and the instructor complimented us on our return. Next half of morning 11.30 to 1.30 we spent in the trenches which although not extensive <strike>was</strike> gave a very good idea of the real thing. I had charge of a platoon of 40 men and had to take them with a guide from the reserve to the firing bays. While they were waiting I had a good look at all the dugouts etc. After dinner our sergeant came round and wanted me to take out a fatigue party of 10 men for the Q.M.S store. I had the deuce of a job to get them as they had all wandered off after dinner. Took them down and when I got there &ndash; found they weren't wanted. our sergeant &ndash; How I cursed. French class in the evening about &frac12; an hour late. Very good and kept us interested right through although fairly elementary. He gave us a sentence and from this we were to compile others. <strike>Vous voulez</strike> Ne voulez-vous pas me faire le plaisir de passer le frere de mon ami dans la rue neuve.<br/>31.5.16 Bull ring. First skirmishing. The bayonet fighting. The trench inspection in which we worked yesterday. Then another bomb lecture. All pretty feeble. Bath this afternoon and when I came back <strike>I  note</strike> I had my attention called to a big column of smoke. Later we saw two aeroplanes and as far as I can make out they were enemy machines raiding a little further south of Paris Plage only about 4 miles away. The white cloud must have been shrapnel shells as we saw four burst together and the cloud took a long time to dissipate. Damage unknown yet. Shrapnel probably fired from the defence shore batteries. Going to French class again to night at 7.15. An extension of previous lecture nothing very interesting.<br/>1.6.16 Bull ring 8 &ndash; 12. First. Barbed wire entanglements. Elementary rifle drill by a pot who mistook us for an awkward squad he had had previously. 3rd Judging distances. 4th elementary bayonet fighting. Had a bath and prepared for leave to visit Etaples. left at 5 and arrived about 5.30. Seems to only consist of one main street and very shoddy at that. However I purchased a torch light and battery. 4.50 &amp; 1.50 and a curiosity and we enjoyed ourselves. Will get a few postcards next time when I have more cash. Now I am quite out. There is a market place and a train connects Etaples railway with Paris Plage.</p>
