<p>In the Trenches<br/>2nd  Aug 1915</p>
<p>My dear Babs<br/>It's ages since I've written to you I don't think I answered your letter of 13th May, you've no idea how hard it is for me to sit down to write a letter, I don't seem to be able to set my mind to the job at all one never seems to have anything much to write about for a start &amp; then again one always seems to want to sleep &amp; sometimes we do not get any at night, so consequently, all ones spare time in the day is taken up trying to get a bit of rest. I've not been feeling too well the last few days &amp; I put it down to being too long in the trenches &amp; sleeping in a damp dug out.</p>
<p>This trench warfare is a weary sort of game &amp; one spends most of one's time dodging shells &amp; an occasional bomb, otherwise there is not very much excitement. Mr Turk took a very nasty turn of mind a few days ago &amp; proceeded to throw a few 11 inch shells over into us &ndash; these brutes weight considerably over &frac12; a ton &amp; make a devil of a splash in the ground, when they go off. On several occasions I've seen big shells burst apparently right among a crowd of men &amp; hurt no one at all &ndash; one came a few mornings ago destroyed my breakfast whilst it  was being cooked, but luckily did not touch the cook, who was standing quite close. Quite the most demoralising thing I have yet come across</p>
