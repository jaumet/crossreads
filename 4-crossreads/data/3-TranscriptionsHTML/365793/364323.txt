<p>Aug 11 Blowing some, &amp; a fair swell on making a chap side step a little. The Colonel softened ,&amp; antied out a "one'er", so I'm even more financial now. School of whales sighted on the Port side. Two of the boys have started Barbering; both on the well deck "aft".<br/>Paid out 5/- to the MO's for 5 weeks duty in advance. Just passed a full-rigged schooner on the Starboard Side. She's doing about 7 or 8 an hour &amp; looks very pretty with all her sails set "prettier than a chap would feel aboard her"?</p>
<p>12  Still a fair swell on causing us to roll some</p>
