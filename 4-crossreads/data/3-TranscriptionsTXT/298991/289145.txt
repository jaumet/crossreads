 Monday February 26th Woke up about 7 am feeling very sleepy &amp; tired. After I had a wash &amp; some breakfast went for a brisk walk. There isn't much of a town here. This is a very big railway junction (goods). After fooling about all the morning went down to the train that will take us as far as Abbeyville. Received twenty four hours rations. I found out that we have to go right back to Amiens &amp; then to Abbeyville, &amp; then the destination (Boulonge) &amp; I wont be sorry when it is reached ether. There are a good few Takons (French colonists) employed here, they like the Chineses, &amp; are extremely lazy, &amp; dirty looking. Left here about 4.30 pm &amp; arrived at Abbeyville at 8 pm. After having something to eat went to bed at the Y.M.C.A. hut. My word the Y.M.C.A. is doing splendid work as regards looking after the comforts of all British soldiers. They even had bunks, mattresses &amp; pillows to sleep in. Had a much faster ride in the train than before, but it was very jerky. 
 Tuesday February 27th After having some breakfast we again entrained for Boulonge. Left Abbeyville at 10.30 am. There are a good few in our truck. There are only two of us Australians in the whole train load. Much better train journey, but my word it is cold travelling. So far we have only pulled up twice, &amp; we have been making the pace "some", all the way. Arrived at Boulonge about 1.30 pm &amp; after about half an hour fooling about with the military police, I eventually got out into the town. After having a look around I caught a tram to the Hospital at Wimmereaux. Arrived there at 5 pm &amp; after having some tea reported at the orderly room. The Hospital is situated on a high hill overlooking the sea, &amp; is 3&frac12; miles out of Boulonge. It consists principally of "shacks" (huts) &amp; occupies a very large area. Every convenience is attached here. My word it is a treat to get to a place like this after the field.
