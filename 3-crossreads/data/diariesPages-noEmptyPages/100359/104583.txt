first one he made shew him the mechanism of his rifle, then as they were handed to him he removed the bolt and broke them up. Then he searched em, and 2 of his mates happened to come near and he got them to give him a hand. He is only a little chap, but game as a bull pup. He came in last night to get some knocks on his hands patched up. I got a piece of copper from him off a German Shell. I also got a button from a big German who came in wounded. Bricky Howard covered himself with glory. He crawled over the parapet and brought in a wounded man from "No Man's Land" Poor old bricky Mason got a touch of shell shock. We got back to camp at about 9 p.m. and every one was absolutely "knocked out" The cars were still arriving with wounded and Tom D. and I and a number of others helped with them till about 1 a.m. then we "turned in." 
Friday 21st 
No longer are we the "bloodless eight" but a good number are still "Tiveys Tourists" having been wounded and continued the tour to England. Our Amb. has been very lucky only 1 man, Beeston, C. Section, getting hit. He stopped a bullet with his shoulders. Didn't "turn out" till dinner time, then I got up and had a hot bath, which was very refreshing. The Huns dropped a few shells in our Brewery and made us feel decidedly uncomfortable. One shell went through the roof of the estaminet next door. The woman who lives there is quite delighted about it and calls it a "souvenir" These French people are certainly optimists. Here was a woman with a few kiddies, stayed in her home with a shell right through it, and we "brave heroes of the 8th, evacuated our loft just because a shell lobbed within 20 yds of it. We stayed in the trenches during the bombardment.
