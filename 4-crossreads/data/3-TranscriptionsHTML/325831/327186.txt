<p>Administrative Headquarters A.I.F.<br/>130 Horseferry Road<br/>London S.W.<br/>19th October 1916</p>
<p>Lieutenant K.A. Ferguson<br/>Tidworth</p>
<p>Dear Mr Ferguson</p>
<p>I have a letter regarding you from the Minister the Honourable G F Pearce, Melbourne. I do not know you, but I know your father very well, &amp; as you are probably the worthy son of a worthy sire, I am sending the Minister's letter on so that you may see it yourself, together with a note from General Monash, &amp; one from General Sir Newton Moore. Please let me know your honest views. I can quite understand the desire of your father's friends, &amp; indeed of himself, to have his sole surviving son in a place of safety, &amp; remember that if you do take the position offered you to train troops, you will&mdash;if the job is well done&mdash;be doing as valuable a service as you would in the hottest part of the firing line. On the other hand, your enthusiasm may dictate to you that you want to go into the firing line, &amp; I am leaving it to you to decide.</p>
<p>I am doing something quite out of the ordinary, but I am dealing with a member of a family quite out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Think over it carefully, &amp; let me know your decision at your early convenience, &amp; let me have the enclosed papers back.</p>
<p>My best wishes will be with you wherever you may elect to be. If you are in London at any time, please give me a call, I shall be glad to meet you. I think I have met you here in a casual way already.</p>
<p>Yours truly</p>
<p>Robt. McC Anderson Colonel Commandant.</p>
