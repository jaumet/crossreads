 10 July 1918 Wednesday (X to X crossed out) Wiring again. X Hear there is a mail in which I hope will throw some light on the Cable re America. The Brigadier's FOWLS!!! have gone back to Bethlehem so that looks as though X Hope  we were going out of the Valley soon Sometimes shudder at our Tucker- Flies, dust, rotten meat unwashed cooks, if it wasn't for the Tin opener a man would soon get general debility- a soldier spends most of his money on Tucker   We are mostly animals after all. I bath in a  Cake Tin  with a Rubber Sponge &amp; Water- 2 quarts.
