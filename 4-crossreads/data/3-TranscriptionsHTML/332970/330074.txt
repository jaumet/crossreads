<p>The marching of the 13th Battn has been absolutely ruined by the Colonel. He has some absurd notion that we should take 18" steps and about 140 to the minute. As a result the long swinging step our men use naturally is always being broken into &amp;has degenerated into a nondescript sort with nobody in step &amp; varying <strike>over</strike> in <strike>pace</strike> time every few seconds.</p>
<p>Another hobby of his is to march us to attention through the desert for miles, <strike>oft</strike>at such times as after musketry etc. One day we had just gone past as the Brigadier noticed us &amp; I heard him call Major Ellis over &amp; say "Major Ellis can you tell me why those men are marching to attention" and at once it went down the line "March at ease". But alas the Brigadier is not always at hand to save</p>
