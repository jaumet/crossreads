<p>All artillary was removed with the exception of 2 guns &amp; these were finally destroyed<br/>Out of about 700 horses &amp; mules we got them all away at Sulva Pier, with the exception of about 50 which at the last were worked night &amp; day They were not destroyed by us probably as a reward for good &amp; faithful service. Anyhow they were played out.  Only one of the original mules, out of hundreds remained.  He was known as Enver Pasha &amp; spent the last few months as a pet. He had a number of bullets in him. Our losses in mules used to be fairly heavy. [Ismail Enver Pasha or Enver Pasha, 1881-1922, was a Turkish military officer and politician, serving as the Turklish Minister of War during World War 1.  'Pasha' was a military rank equivalent to Brigadier.]<br/>Although the enemy never bothered us much by air reconnaissance our people took no risks &amp; we continually had an aeroplane up to keep their aeronauts from coming over. On the 2nd second last night we heard an aeroplane overhead &amp; were much relieved when we learned it was one of our fleet.</p>
<p>The 3000 men were got away in batches timed to embark at 6, 9 &amp; 11 pm.<br/>The distances from the flanks to the piers was about 2 miles so you can image how much depended on the enemy not breaking through our defence in the centre.<br/>I was timed to go at 6, but there were a few too many so had to wait near the pier till 11.</p>
