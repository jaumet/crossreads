<p>11/8/18<br/>Framerville<br/>in the 21st Bn. We rode across to the village &ndash; the roads and fields are not much shell pitted &ndash; and had a few shells and other excitement as we rode up the main street. My horse nearly threw me by stumbling into a big shell hole &ndash; the place has been much knocked about since the we were in here yesterday. The road in places was covered with debris from tonight's air bombing. Just at the corner near the Church is the same festering heap of the horses killed by our armoured cars. The stench was awful. In a cellar I found Colonel Batemean and relieved him of a two company frontage. Our relief went fairly well. I also took over a coy. frontage from Col Currie of the 28th.</p>
