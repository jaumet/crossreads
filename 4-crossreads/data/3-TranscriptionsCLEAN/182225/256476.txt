 1916   SATURDAY 23   DEC. 
 Very cold & windy & it snowed for about an hour in the morning. I was loading our mobilisation ammunition into the waggons all the morning & got leave till Monday night & went into the Abbey Hotel Amesbury to Mother & Peter. I expected to see Alan there also but he could not get up. Stayed in Hotel all the evening. Got Auntie Florences letter & a watch.
