I am as fit as a fiddle so dont be alarmed at me being on this boat. Had bad luck two days ago - have been going in for a lot of exercise during the trip & on the said day I unfortunately sprained my ankle, am nursing it carefully & expect to be able to walk off O.K. at Sydney - dont be alarmed if I limp off. Rotten bad luck isn't it.We have had a very long voyage left England on the 17th March, on a boat called the "Tzaritza" & changed ships at Alexandria after waiting in the latter port 2 weeks. Everybody very annoyed.Fondest love to Ralph & Beres & self, & will see you about the 20th.Lovingly yours.
