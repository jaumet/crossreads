<p><u>Later. Friday 9th July 1915</u><br/>Since writing enclosed letter I have this morning received Mother's letter of 13th April, one from Aunt Mary dated May 3rd, P.C. from Pat dated 14/4/15. And also a letter from Max dated 14/4/15.<br/>This will tell you how irregular the mails are when I received letters of almost a month later date 5 days ago.<br/>Terence</p>
