<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>Ellis has gone up to Dick's flat to play cards but I have not written for over a week so I am just scribbling a few lines to you &amp; to Auntie while I have the chance.  We are kept very busy all day &amp; we generally have 2 nights dancing, 2 at the Cinema or Theatre &amp; I go to Sarum once a week &amp; stay the night with Mr Edmonds.  I was there on Wednesday night having spent the afternoon with Mr Freemantle at the Close.</p>
