 Aerodrome 2-3-16. 
 From. Major. H.V. Vernon, 1st R.R. of L.H. (prov'l) 
 To. the  Camp  Commandant. A.I.F. Hdqrs. 
 With permission obtained from Brig. Genl C.F. Cox C.B. 1st A.L.H. Bde, I beg to be considered in the new formations. 
 My services are:- Major. C.M.F. August 24th 1914. Appointed 2nd in command 1st L.H. A.I.F. Aug. 27. 1914 Appointed to command 1st L.H. May 6th 1915 to take the Regt to Gallipoli:  remained in charge till July 29th when taken away through fever:  recurrence in Egypt and sent to England where I was given 6 weeks leave. 
 On return was naturally supernumary &amp; was given no duty pending new formation. 
 Jan. 12th 1916 Brig-Gen. C.B. Cox recommended me for command of all the details of the Bde, &amp; of the proposed reserve Regt. 
 Jan. 14th 1916: Bde moved out: since then the camp has been conducted on the provisional Regimental Establishment, not as a Detail Camp, more as a training depot in all branches possible with the large numbers in the camp:  average daily state 1800, maximum 2250. 
 My request for your consideration is in your hands but were I allowed to state my preference, I would ask for command of any Light Horse Regt on Reserve or otherwise, that can be equipped &amp; trained as a Regt, separate from details, even if in command of Bde. details as well:  so that should a Regt be called on for service, I move out trained &amp; complete, &amp; hand over Bde details to another. 
 H.V. Vernon Major. C.O. Reserve Regt. of L.H. (Prov'l)
