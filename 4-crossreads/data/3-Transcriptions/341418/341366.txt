<p>I must light up my last pipe now as it grows dark  &amp;  "no smoking after dark".<br/>About 11 pm<br/>Halted beside some evil smelling marsh in order.<br/>About 2.30 am<br/>Halted again. always halting now. The sandflies are awful. Nothing doing yet though it is still dark as you can see from my writing.<br/>[Transcribers note: last entries in very wiggly uneven writing as he is obviously writing in the dark]<br/>Some miles beyond Bir el Abd" about 5. 30 am<br/>Well the darkness is over  &amp;  the sun us up and not a shot fired!</p>
