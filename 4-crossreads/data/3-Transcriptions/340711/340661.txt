<p>White---white as chalk.</p>
<p>Sunday, 22.<br/>It is a prison this Fort Pitt. Mrs Cuckney and Miss W. came to see me, and it was only with great difficulty that they could get in. The conversation was very strained. The atmosphere was stifling. The doctors are fine fellows---the nurses are rotten. As I wrote Miss W. later I said "I guess you're right about conversation in a hospital at least Fort Pitt. It's not an ideal spot. Il y a de mieux---n'est-ce pas? H&eacute;las! La vie est toujours de m&acirc;me, toujours, interresante, mais toujours coquette. Des fois elle parle, peut-etre d'une voix tendre at caressante, mais ce qu'elle dit---H&eacute;las! nous ne pouvous pas entendre &agrave; cause du bruit des autres---n'est-ce pas? L'ame est toute-puissante parmi des grandes choses de la vie, mais lorsqu'elle se mele aux choses petites et ordinaires, elle n'est que silencieuse ou distraite, souvent hesitante et timide".</p>
<p>Wednesday, 25.<br/>Ordered to be ready to leave Convalescent Hospital (unknown) at moment's notice.</p>
<p>Left by motor ambulance for Tunbridge Wells about 5.30pm. Not sorry either. The trip took about an hour and a quarter (26 miles)</p>
<p>Thursday, 26.<br/>Men, (St. John's Ambulance and fine fellows too) were there to bath us last night. Pyjamas dressing gowns, slippers, hot water bottles, linoleum floored wards, big hearth rugs---music---flowers---home atmosphere---entire absence of all Military tone! Those were my first recollections of Kingswood Park V.A.D. Hospital, Tunbridge Wells. Concert in evening---could not sit it out however---my back pretty weak.</p>
<p>Friday, 27.<br/>I have just sighed a long, long sigh---of content. I am in</p>
