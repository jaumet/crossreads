<p>Dear Jack,<br/>Just a note as we are on the move for another camp &amp; things are upside down. Got a letter from you last mail &amp; judge that you have been having a rough time. Gee-whiz but you must have a few howling matches there occasionally.</p>
<p>Hope dear old Clare is OK also Allie K. Give Clare my love. Also tell her that I wrote to Mrs Dye &amp; she has invited me up to Pt Said. As things are now of course I can't get away just for a while.</p>
<p>We are expecting to be brawling with Johnny Turk &amp; hope to give him a load or two. Things are greatly stirred here just now. Any way, the Devil looks after his own so have no fear &amp; expect a line of more length shortly from your lovingly</p>
<p>Bill.</p>
