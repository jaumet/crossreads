aerodrome, and flew so as to just pass over the top of the Cine: the effect was extremely impressive. I went up in Capt Smith's Bristol Fighter (a 190 HP machine) - and doing over 90 miles per hour we rapidly come up with the formation. We went down nearly to Beersheba, our machine circling round the flat whilst I took cinema at 7,000 feet we looked down onto the banks of cumulus and through the fleeting openings down. onto the old Turkish trenches. Capt. Addison did a series of manoeuvres, Looping, diving and rolling etc, which showed the admirable control of the Pilot with modern machines. At 4.30 a spiral nose dive dropped us from 5,000 to 2,500 feet in a few seconds. We returned to the aerodrome without mishap, after a delightful run, which I can only compare with the ride of old Elijah when he went up in his heavenly chariot.
