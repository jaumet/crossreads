<p>The inset copy of Defence S.380 of 20.5.20 is forwarded for your information:-</p>
<p>&quot;Commandant,</p>
<p>2nd Military District.</p>
<p>It is noted that some Districts in the course of correspondence refer to Officers and other ranks as Captain....M.C. and Bar, Major.....D.SO. and Bar, Corporal....D.C.M. and Bar.</p>
<p>2. The practice of adding the words &quot;and Bar&quot; to the designation of the Decoration to which the person concerned may have been awarded a Bar is incorrect.</p>
<p>3. For purposes of correspondence etc the designation of the Decoration only is to be used, even though the person referred to may have been awarded a Bar to the decoration.</p>
<p>4. It is also noted that Officers holding Brevet, Honorary, or Temporary Rank are signing official correspondence and orders as .......Captain and Brevet Major......Major (Hon. Lieut-Colonel) etc. This is not correct. In such cases the rank to be shown is the highest whether it be Brevet, Honorary Temporary or substantive.&quot;</p>
