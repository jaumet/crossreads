<p>being very useful for cleaning brass buttons). one poor chap I remember used it as a tooth-brush, resulting in starvation for many days owing to the bristles from the &quot;tooth-brush&quot; remaing in his gums, causing such irritation as to form ulcers, or some such complaint. He refused to take warning and so had to &quot;buy&quot; his experience. I think it was the same fellow who tasted the soap, being hungry and imagining it might be cheese.
