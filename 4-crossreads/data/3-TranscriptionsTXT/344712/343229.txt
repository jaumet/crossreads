 [Transcriber's note:  Burgis gives brief details of the voyage to Suez where he disembarked and travelled by train to Cairo.  He describes his training and his time exploring the sights of Cairo.  He arrives in Gallipoli some time after 21 August and gives very graphic descriptions of the fighting taking place.  He was sent to England with shell shock in October 1915 and his diary concludes on arrival in Fulham Hospital, Hammersmith.  He returned to Australia in March 1917.] 1363 Private F.C.
