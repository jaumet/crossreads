<p>got to work on our dug outs, get up our stores and water I was sent with ten others on the water fatigue about two miles away,&nbsp;two of us got sniped at,&nbsp;of course we were raw and did not know the ropes but coming back we met a New Zealand chap and I can tell you we hung on to him like a leach, he put us wise to a lot of tips told us when to run for it and when to crawl etc. we crossed a place called bloody Angle where they reckon one out of three get past, they have a machine Gun trained on one part of it somewhere in the scrub and you are very lucky if you get through, well along we came and our Guide gave us the tip when to bolt and I tell you we did skip some, water or no water, one of the boys got it right through his forearm and the rim of my water tin got buckled up, when we got past I sat down and began to think a lot but the New Zealand chap roared laughing at us and glibly said thats nothing we got back without further trouble minus a lot of water our officers told us we should have gone by the saps but as I said before we were raw very raw indeed, I think I should have felt very nervey but for the smoking which is a great soother I guess I paid particular</p>
