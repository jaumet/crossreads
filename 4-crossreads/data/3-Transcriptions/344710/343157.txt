<p>Sat. 8.12.17<br/>Had Long yarn to some of the boys of the Bat. this morning.  The crowd got on O.K.  They (C Coy) were in Reserve Trenches.<br/>Saw, and spoke to, Birdwood, in the sap.  What does it mean?  "Birdie" here, and all those guns coming in!  It may mean a stunt;  but hardly I think.  The river Lys would seem to make that impossible.<br/>Had a close call Last night up on the job.  Put the wind up me well &amp; truly.<br/>A fool Engineer Officer flashing his torch about was to blame.  The Hun put down a Lovely sample of Little barrage.  All 5.9's.  One blew me off my feet &amp; gave me a mouth full of fumes.  We Lay doggo for 20 minutes or so &amp; then bolted home.  The Officer in question fell in a new shell hole full of icy cold water;  which rather pleased the rest of us.<br/>Our job is nearly done &amp; Looks A1.  Then we'll go &amp; join up the Company I suppose.<br/>I'm not in the pink tonight.  A bit nervous and hate admitting it.  Last night's act unnerved me just a bit I think.  I can still taste that phosphorus.  However ---</p>
