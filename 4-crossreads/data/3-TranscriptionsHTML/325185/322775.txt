<p>Dear Sir<br/>We had the pleasure of having your son Cop A.C.Giles to stay with us for a few days in November last. Since about the beginning of January last we seem unable to reach him. Our letters are returned marked "Unable to trace" &ndash;yet we get letters from him I had one this morning dated May 5th &amp; saying how he would like to hear. Yet we have written several times. H e speaks of having heard from you so your letters must reach him. Would you be so kind as to tell me how you address his letters? We like your son so much &amp; should be so sorry for him to think we had forgotten or neglected him. I shall write to him again today, hoping for better luck. It will be a very long time</p>
