Trenches in an awful state, hundreds of dead wounded lying in the trench, an awful sight to see the manner in which they were mutilated, hundreds of others lying in no man's land, but cannot be brought in till night. After 8th Brigade wound had been collected, sent to 15 Bgde trenches, casualties much heavier in this section 14 Brigade suffered likewise. Arrived at this section 11.30 pm
