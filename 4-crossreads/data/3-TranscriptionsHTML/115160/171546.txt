<p>Darling Mither,</p>
<p>Have just received the end of August eltters and very pleased indeed to note you are all in your usual. &nbsp;I see poor old Dad had a touch of the cold but note he is about again.</p>
<p>I note that the shop is keeping its end up altho&#39; I see things are becoming more stringent to do business. &nbsp;Still, I suppose Lock will be using his head and take no risks. &nbsp;And what sort of stuff is butter? I have forgotten the taste of it, and quite used to margarine altho I don&#39;t go nap on it.</p>
<p>I read with interest the IWW extracts Lock sent me. &nbsp;It is indeed&nbsp;</p>
