We?d a coot amongst us 
In the first L.H.F.A. 
Three stars with the title of Doctor. 
But the boys all used to say 
"Doctor, Gor struth, he's no doctor
But a butcher of bleedin kine
And the sticking of pigs at the Island
Is more in ?is bleedin line."

And the title fitted him handsome
For he?d earned his sobriquet
For the butchers instincts were in him
And he showed it us day by day
And the knife, the probe and scissors
Were ever his constant call
And the quivering flesh he tortured
It was Practice and that was all 
5
He was mad on the antiseptics
And hed lecture you like a pro
On Carbolics, and Borics, and Chlorides
Stuff any old fool would know
It was "Bring me some strong Carbolic"
Five per cent, please for this job
And that dish to wash my hands in
And a warm boric swab.
6
And when you had brought him, a wet swab
He would want dry wool because 
Well, because he did, but in the end
He much preferred gauze
And the patient must keep his pants down
Lest the trousers touched a sore
And when there was only a single germ
Might bring in a million more
