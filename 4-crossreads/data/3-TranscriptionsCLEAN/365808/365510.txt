  
 The surroundings are delightful. It is my first experience of Cambridge and I am charmed with the colleges, courts, lawns & river scenery. So far I have managed to wander over a few of the older colleges. But we have not a great deal of time off. It was rather a blow having to slip off from the Division just now, but things wont be over for a bit yet. With kindest regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy & yourself. Yours affectionately Walter Macallen
