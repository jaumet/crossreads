<p>July 1917<br/>13th   indiscretion on my part is was deemed best that I should not go, although I had been "booked" for it for some time &amp; the Div. Regimental S.M. went in my place.   This would, in all probabilities have meant a spell of 5 to 6 months in Blighty for me.<br/>15th   This morning Nos 2 &amp; 4 sections went for a route march along the canal as far as ------------ a village about 5 Km from here &amp; returned by a circuitous route doing in all about 10 miles.   We had the afternoon off &amp; most of us went for a swim in the canal.</p>
