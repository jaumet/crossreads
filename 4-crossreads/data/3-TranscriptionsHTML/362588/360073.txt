<p>definitely beforehand that they could not go ashore.  After the men had been brought back on board the officers were again allowed ashore in relays.  I had just 2 hours from the time I went over the side till I got back again and as the ship was about 1&frac14; miles from the shore it was a fairly hurried trip.  I went with Lt. Pye of A Company &amp; we hired a car, of which there are many very fine ones there, and had a 40 minutes run.  We left the choice of route to our black driver.  I don't know where we went but it was the most glorious 40 minutes I have ever spent.  The roads were perfect and heavily shaded by huge palms on either side.  The bungalows, which are nearly all snow-white, are more beautiful than anything I had ever pictured and the colours of the foliage and lawns are glorious.  I should have liked to have about a week in Colombo to go round slowly &amp; enjoy its beauties.  It is a most facinating place.  The car, by the way, cost 10/- for 40 minutes.  We must have run about 15 miles.  We left Colombo at 9 oclock the same night.</p>
