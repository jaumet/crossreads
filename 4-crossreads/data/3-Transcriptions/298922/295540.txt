<p>Saturday 18 August 1917</p>
<p>HOSPITAL<br/>Alexandria Race Club sent complimentary Tickets to the Hospital so I went &amp; enjoyed it but it was very Hot. Nearly all Officers in Alexandria can be seen there, &amp; the world &amp; his wife. I paid expenses. In the evening a dance is held at SAN STEFANO CASINO HOTEL on the Beach, a cosmopolitan crowd. We are not supposed to be out after 8 p.m. but by Bucksheesh to the Native Servants &amp; carrying one's boots in hand, one can get in like a Burglar after 8. M.O. says I can return on Wednesday next to the Regiment so I don't mind being caught.</p>
