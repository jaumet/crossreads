<p>The  public  press.</p>
<p>We left Ferry post &amp; came across the canal to Moscar on the 25th May, expect to entrain from here to Alexandria any day, but we are all busy cleaning our harness for a big general Inspection. It would make you laugh to see sitting out in the hot sun, cleaning steel parts with dear old Egypts sand, &amp; water, but the best of the joke after we have cleaned the harness a dust storm will come up &amp; it will look worse than before, we do some funny things in this army of ours.</p>
