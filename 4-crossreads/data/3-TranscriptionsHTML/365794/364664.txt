<p>Wednesday 19 September 1917<br/>Quite well &amp; fit for breakfast 8.30 a.m.  We are now entering the G. Aust. bight and report says will not be <strike>out</strike> across it until Saturday.<br/>Quiet sleepy day.  Dull and raining at intervals and too much fear of seasickness for us to stay long at meals.<br/>Chaplain Birch very interested in all meals and an authority on our different dishes.<br/>Trying to educate me in various Indian terms, viz., Butter Mucken Water Parnee.</p>
