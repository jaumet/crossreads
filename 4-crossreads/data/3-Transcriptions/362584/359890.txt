<p>new clothes have to be take the place of washed ones. It may seem strange, but ever since we left the peninsula we have been worse off for water than we were over there. With the exception of a bath or two on our sea voyage I haven't had a bath for years. The one great advantage of this training is, that when I get home, I will only want the bath room for a few minutes once a month, &amp; then I'll be satisfied with a soup dish full of water. Talking about things in general reminds me that reveille goes at a most uncomfortable hour in the morning, &amp; reveille much resembles being turned out of bed.
