May

looks very nice, There are plenty of soldiers on shore mostly Lighthorsemen.

There is two other troopships in harbour as well as us, They have imperial troops aboard and I believe that they are going to England.

In the evening we were besieged with native boats full of the natives selling all sorts of silks and other wares. They ask you enormous prices for things that are worth only a few shillings, and if you are fool enough to pay it you can. You can generally manage to beat them down a lot, for instance if they ask you 30/- for a length of Silk you can run them down and finally purchase it from them for about [indecipherable] 5/-. We are going to take one or two Light horse Officers on board from here. At 5.30pm after we had finished taking on all the fresh water that was wanted to last us till our next port of call
