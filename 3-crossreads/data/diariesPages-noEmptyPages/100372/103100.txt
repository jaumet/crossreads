but not before Jacko had blown them up. However Engrs will soon remedy that. Water chief difficulty. On a.m. of 2nd NZs & L.H. scrapped with Jacko & took wells or caves of Lekyeh (Khirbit Likyeh) which were good supply for L.H. 
1st-4th Beersheba was mined all over township but troops too old to be caught, mines discovered & removed. Stores of fodder wood & some foodstuff also taken. Town not very large, couple of good stone buildings including a 2 storeyed one which was being used as hsptl & on which flew two red crescent flags. New Rly stns in progress of being built. Did not see much of town when passing thro. About 20 R.W.Fs wounded passed thro our hands. Saw German battery of 4 guns (part of the booty) & judging by the number of shell cases there they must have got hell. Shrapnel helmets very effective & doing good work. Aerial scrap on 3rd, our chaps came first. Jacko forced down with what result not yet known to us. Water very scarce for other than drinking & cooking washing unknown. Padre Boosence (RC.) took photo of town for me, one from minaret of mosque.
5th Shifted from Camp Abu Jerwal to Caves of Lekiyeh. Spent half day there then relieved NZs a mile or so further on. Heavy fighting for wells of Khuwelfieh, which changed hands once. Very strong position on hills commanding same but we got them. For a day or so they were no manâ€™s, but our arty settled the question. Utting & I from our next camp (Khuwelfieh) went up & had a look at same. M.G. positions plentiful & all ideal. Underground granaries on Tel el K. being utilised as emplacements.
