acre with a green hedge it looks alright. The trees are stripped of leaves at present. The farm-houses are real old fashioned style just like you see of an English homestead, made of brick, oblong in shape with thatched rooves with in some cases ivy over it no verandahs. The biggest herd I saw was about a dozen or 15. At Exeter we were given a cup of tea a bun waving to all the young tarts of course. From dark to our destination we played 500, a matter of 3 or 4 hrs. Got out in dark cold marched about 4 mls. to camp which with the wind blowing bitterly. Almost got me fagged. Had a bit of bread jam went to bunk. Had 3 blankets on me pillow underneath my overcoat over me freezing. Another very big day.Wed.Up at 6.30 here but pitch dark switch on lights. Cold as blazes. It rained snowed
