<p>My Dear Sis,<br/>I was indeed real pleased to hear from you again. I thought you were never going to write. I think the photo is perfectly lovely my word she must be a bonnie little kid no wonder your letter is full of her. I'm sure you must both be very proud of her but still wait till one of mine comes to light. Don't you think she is very much like that photo of you when you was a kid? I do.</p>
