<p>April 1917<br/>30th.   We resumed our work this morning and a fatigue party of about 20 German prisoners have been attached to my party &amp; a few to the others.   They are working very well &amp; I am general interpreter to the lot.   They are living at Tootencourt, about 5 Km away &amp; are brought here &amp; back in moter transports.</p>
<p>May<br/>1st.  The weather has been beautifully fine since we have been here &amp; the trees are shooting out in green foliage.   We had the Germans again to-day &amp; are carring on with our usual work.</p>
