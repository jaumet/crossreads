  
 through a Chateau garden on the Somme, it is very beautiful. Parade again this afternoon Monday 23rd  on The Somme Left Pont Remy about 5 Am had a walk of 8 miles, very cold, boarded motor lorries, the motors took us about 40 miles, through Flixecourt to Amiens then a rest for about an hour then another walk of ten miles, the hardest day since the Tel-el-Kebir march. I never saw so many motor lorries, there were hundreds of them lined up on the road waiting for us. The walk at the finish was awful, never saw such mud, had to drop off near the finish, could not keep up, but came on slowly, a good many dropped out. I & another Sig. for the present are attached to A Coy. temporarilly, & just now this Coy is in reserve we are camped on a hill, freezing cold especially at night. The night we arrived here the most of us had to camp out. only a few tents, it was the coldest night I have ever experienced, though I had two blankets I could not sleep much though very tired from the forced march. In the morning the ground was covered with frost. Oct 26th The two coys. have returned
