<p>attack  last evening and night. On receiving news of the great victory in the Pursian Gulf, an order came out to fire one round from every gun and rifle on the peninsula. The men in the trenches cheered when they got this order The Turks thought it was an attack and showed themselves so you see no ammunition was wasted.<br/>The 6th Battery wagon line is still having a lively time, a few 4.7 in amongst them yesterday. One chap left his dugout and went into another, when he came back his dugout was a complete wreck, he was lucky. It is going to be a dirty day. I am writing this at 5.30 A.M. Sunday. I never in all my life saw so much sickness amongst troops as here. They get bad in their inside (dysentry) and then they get what the doctors call debility, and are then sent away to hospital The damage done at the base today is serious, the wireless station is blown to atoms 6 men killed and four wounded. There has been more shells over today than usual. Our Battery had a narrow escape this evening a German aeroplane over dropped 2 bombs. One failed to explode, the other</p>
