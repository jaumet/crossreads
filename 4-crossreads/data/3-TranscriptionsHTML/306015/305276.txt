<p>Aug.   22   We marched to the canal-bank &amp; there heard a lecture on the latest German gas, commonly called 'mustard' gas.</p>
<p>The afternoon was a half-holiday.</p>
<p>Alan and I visited the Arques glass-works &amp; saw the complete process entailed in producing tumblers, wine glasses, liqueur glasses, lamp-funnels etc.</p>
<p>The process itself was exceedingly interesting, but my attention <strike>directed</strike> was drawn chiefly to the workers themselves.   There were worn out, emaciated-looking men, girls, and boys, many of very tender years, like so many <strike>other earthly</strike> devils in a little hell of their own.   Some worked around the furnace filled with molten glass, others carried bits of this on long blow-tubes, others blew it &amp; so on.   (Of course all our cigarettes &amp; matches soon leaked out of our pockets.)</p>
<p>I noticed, one wee chap in particular:  he had to set a mould for the blowers &amp; was kept busy</p>
