Then the second one swooped with a devilish rattle of machine gun fire, and immediately the Taube turned and dived like a stone, nose down for the earth, his exhaust shooting up a column of smoke as he went. There was great excitement at the Hospital, Everyone was crying out "He's hit, They've got him. Indeed, it seemed so. Those who had glasses however said that the Taube only dived as a ruse, for after descending about 500 feet he straightened out and proceeded on his course.
