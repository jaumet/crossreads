Bakeries in Egypt when Australians first arrived were at Suez ? Alexandria ? Cairo
The Bakery in Cairo was in the old Slave market, and consisted of six brick ovens which had been sufficient to supply the Garrison troops at Abbassia and Kas-re Nil Barracks previous to outbreak of War. After which a number of Aldershots were built. For a short time after we arrived in Egypt a number (30 to 40 men 13 A.A.S.C) were detailed for duty each day there
It was a gruesome place and the blood bespattered walls did not instil us with any great respect for the Egyptian rulers of the past Another bakery was at Bibbinluke. This Bakery had previously belonged to a German on one side of the block and an Italian on the other side ? These were converted into one large Bakery. There were four different types of ovens here and had evidently been a very modern Bakery. The Bosche had fled hurriedly as his household furniture which was elaborate was left intact The Egyptian Bakers were still retained by military with of course a Sergeant Major and Corporal and four Privates to superintend. This Bakery was capable of turning out 250-000 rations per 24 hours. The Bakery at Alexandria was in Ras el-Tin
