form now & again & took what they wanted - paying of course with chits.  Some of the people here speak English well - in fact there are a proportion of American & even Australian Jews amongst them tho the majority are Russian subjects if what they claim is correct.  Hebrew & Arabic they all speak & many German also not to mention French.  Incidentally my French has not markedly improved.  When I get stuck I can usually make myself understood after hard thinking, in that language but conversations in which I engage are always rather laborious & would, I am sure, sound ludicrous to, for instance, your friend - the Mademoiselle whom Dorothy delighted to pair me with.
You must be getting tired of all this, so I will not tax your patience further.
I will look up L/Cpl. Blackwell the first time I am near the 1st Brigade.
Hope you & Mrs. Ferguson, Dorothy & Keith are all well.  My best regards to yourself & them - also to Mr. & Mrs. Curtis.  I myself am perfectly O.K.
Yours very sincerelyR.J. Hunter
