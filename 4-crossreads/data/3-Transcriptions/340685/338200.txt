<p>west of us at Croix Marshal. Chapel Farm an old church and graveyard with a billet a little way away with a gun and observers post in it was shelled to-day and one shot blew everything in all directions into the air with bricks etc flying about and another shot just grazing the top of the roof. About 20 rounds of howitzer shells were poured in and our fatigue party had their billets quite close to it. About 15 of our planes were in the air together about 4.30 to-day and annoyed Fritz very much by skimming about 1200 yards above his trenches and he wasted a lot of rifle and machine gun fire on them. Very funny watching them shelling our planes with shrapnel. I haven't seen one hit yet. As soon as things get warm our pilot turns off his course at an angle &amp; of course Fritz's next shots are a long way out &amp; it is some time before he can find the range again. Shrapnel bursts with a flash &amp; considerable detonation in the air with white smoke remaining stationary in the air for a considerable time and is easily taken for cloud the bullets being impelled on with the original speed of the shell. Sometimes Fritz uses high explosives in the air in the hope that the plane will be upset by the concussion. Immelmann the crack german planist was brought down here last Sunday I saw in the paper and we witnessed the fight 3 of our machines to two of Fritz's; also the other German was compelled to descend. No German planes seen here for a long time and we seem to be complete masters of the air here. We are springing a big surprise on the Germans shortly in the front trenches by the adoption of a 240 lb trench mortar 4 times the size of the ones now in use which are very much dreaded by the germans. A great advance shortly predicted here and probably along the whole battle front. our artillery opened about 9.30 and kept going till very late. A big gun just at the back of us keeping me awake.<br/>26.6.16 Were awakened at about 7.30 but went to sleep again and when we got up to go to <strike>work</strike> get breakfast everybody was at work and breakfast was somewhat scrambled. Same party working for us again to-day and a lazier mob it would be hard to get &ndash;most of them lay out on the ground and tried to dodge work. This afternoon Higginbotham shook them up and I had a party of five loafing all the afternoon. Two hot meals to-day and another issue of tobacco. Some artillery this afternoon mainly on the trenches I think and to-night there is supposed to be a bombardment from 9 to 2 in the morning.<br/>27.6.16 Bombardment didn't come off but just before dark one of our aeroplanes destroyed five German observation baloons by dropping phosphorus from a good height which very effectively did the work. They were quickly set alight and descended slowly with a red flare and long spiral of smoke. This phosphorus seems pretty dangerous and is said to cover an acre of ground at a time. our men in the front trenches cheered long &amp; lustily but about</p>
