  
 We are led to believe we are only here for a short time as rumour has it we are going out for a spell and then proceeding up north of France again A move we are all looking forward to as we have now been on this front almost continually since Oct 1916 and through the worst of weather 
 May 20th At last we have come out for a spell and later go up north. 
 Leaving Velu Wood at 9AM a party of 9 of us proceeded on bikes to Bavilencourt a distance of 30 odd miles
