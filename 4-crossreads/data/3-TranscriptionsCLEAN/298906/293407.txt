  
 way I will be pleased for Wilkie like myself knew nothing being a stranger & Mills knows the ropes from A. to Z. he has been here so long. They handed in last night from B.O.R. a "state" which was the most complicated affair as ever I had time to look at, & there being no S.M. I had to try & puzzle it out, I got quite a sweat up & then never made head nor tail of it & was in consequence  was  20 min late with my "parade state", I didn't give a hang, but they never said nothing, it was supposed to be in by 9 oclock  wa  but it was nearer 10 by the time they got it. All our 24th Reinforcements were medically examined this morning & 1 chap was absent.
