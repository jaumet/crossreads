Love spring morn ? a Taub flew up and down and our avigun put some shell veri close and he turn tail and made off ? veri unlik our who take no notic and finish their reconnaiss howev bad bombard . Veri pretti upaloft made of some transpar airlik substanc . Trench veri dirti and requir a lot of clean up . Parti on lower expos gangway at communic trench . At about noon our artilleri commenc a bombard of the enemi trench about 3/4 mile on our left and the flash and fire of burst shell was thick among the tree there . The enterpris enemi rose to the occas and respond in kind , shell follow each other in veri close success and crash into and around build near Boi Grenier send up shower of dirt . Notic that the shower of debri was visibl while the scream of the shell and it subsequ nois of explos follow . A good exampl of sight be faster than hear .

Sudden at 8.30 two flare were to go up and simultan all the machin gun ( laid dead or dure daylight ) were to sudden sweep the parapet and each man here was to fire two round rapid dead in .
