Back to the Fantome - then I saw the Destroyers come in - I was asked to dine on the Elax - I did this & then we took some grub ashore for a sick man - The want of food is very bad - The sick in the Garrison Hosp to-day had Rice & Tea - There was nothing else to give them - no sugar.  The Garrison is on 1/4 rations -The whole of German N.G & islands want fresh meat - Potatoes - Onions - Officers - men sick - convalescent want meat potatoes onions - There is no fresh meat in Rabaul - Herbertshohe no onions & no potatoes & yet Australia is but 3 days off - The feeding of the garrison has been very very bad & is worse to-day - The sick cant recover or the convalescent get better unless fed - I've fed my sick & given them whisky & milk  & they have recovered - The w & milk gave them an appetite. If I could I'd placard Sydney - Rabaul wants "Fresh meat - Potatoes - Onions" - Herbertshohe w same & Wilhelmshafen wants same. The well want same. The sick & so on -
