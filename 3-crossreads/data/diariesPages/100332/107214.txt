A large number of German Prisoners were busy building huts for the engine men so in a few days all hands will be comfortable. At meal times you go into a Large Tent with Table Forms an Orderly brings in the food serves it out. After a good Dinner of Stew Potatoes Carrots Rice, we both turned in at 1 Pm I slept fairly well until 6 Pm, when I arose went down to the Canal which runs along side of the Camp to have a wash. This Canal will be very handy in the Summer for the boys to swim in.
