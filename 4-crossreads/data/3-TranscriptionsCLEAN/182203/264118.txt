  
 to Church Parade at 9. 30. a.m. Was supposed to be on duty but my ward is nearly empty to-day, so Sister sent word that I could go if I wished. It was a most interesting service  Our Chaplin (Aust.) was the preacher & he gave an excellent sermon on "Praise".  He is a great man & the boys all like him - Last night Aust. Unit (Orderlies) gave us all an excellent concert. The Padre was the accompainist. Some of them have very good voices. One of Dr Aitchison's sons sang & has a very good voice - both of his sons are Orderlies. Captain Fay is one of our Medical Officers & is an awfully nice fellow. Must be very young for a M.O.
