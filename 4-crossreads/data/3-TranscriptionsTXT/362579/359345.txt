 Hope you had a very Happy Day 
 My dearest Mother. 
 I'm on Night-duty again, so writing first thing on your birthday. Things are very quiet here   &amp;  find it hard to keep awake. Shall get all my letters up to date if here long. 
 Sad to say two of us are here for Temporary-duty   &amp;  not liking it, miss all our friends.
