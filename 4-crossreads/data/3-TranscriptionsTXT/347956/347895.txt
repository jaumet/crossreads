Mon 22ndHad to report to A Squadron again this morning & heard that Jimmy Leask is to be made Corporal of A Sqd. & I reckon he should be sent to A Sq & learn the work straight away, as to keep me there taking his place for a week or two before he starts;  I got into a argument this morning for galloping my horse while on parade & have been in a bad humor all day in consequence.  went nowhere after tea & had nothing to do but tell tales
