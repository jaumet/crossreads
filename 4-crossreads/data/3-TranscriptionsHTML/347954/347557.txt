<p>against this rotten stuff.  The days are still hot &amp; sultry &amp; bad smells from the dead almost take ones breath away.  Our old donkey has given birth to a lovely little baby donkey &amp; its antics are watched by all with great glee.  It is marvellous how it survives the shot &amp; shell which daily goes across the plain on which these animals graze.  We are at last on to something definite &amp; we hope it may mean finish to this campaign here.  Everything is astir &amp; general bustle is the order of the day.  Iron rations are being taken up behind the trenches &amp; rest houses for the wounded are springing up everywhere.  A general attack is being launched all along our lines &amp; our boys are all alive to a good amount of killing, etc.  August 6th, Friday &amp; a day prior to our own gentle surprise, the Turks on our right wing attempted a bomb charge on a trench we had captured a week previously at a loss of a hundred men &ndash; they gained their objective temporarily but the Turks who gained the trenches never got back to their lines again.  I saw three go along as prisoners &amp; a whole heap more piled dead in a corner nearby.  Their own field guns killed them in our trenches &amp; altho the scrapping continued throughout the day the casualties were not too numerous considering all things.</p>
