Firing not so heavy throughout night. Aeroplanes overhead. Big shell exploded in hill not far off camp, covering us all with dirt. 22nd - Raining lightly in morning, made grey clayey soil very sticky & uncomfortable. Preparing for building hospital this afternoon. Went down to beach & brought all our equipment up & left same at foot of Gully. Sgt. Morgan & Cpl Webb, slept there.

Relics bayonets, cartridges, belts etc found. Went for swim on beach & drew rations in afternoon. Arrangements made for shifting camp to near 3rd Fd. Amb Started Dugouts [Note in margin:] Italy declared War 24th - Digging our dug-outs in new position. Armistice to bury dead arranged between Austns & Turks. from 9am to 4pm. Visited trenches about noon Gruesome sight. Hundreds of bodies Turks 12 to 1 lying about unburied. Cartridges & equipment galore. Some found with trench tools in hand having started dugouts when bowled over. Capt Robinson told me they had found Lieut Roberts' (Alf's cousin  brother ) body. All or most of Austns buried, estimated about 2500 or 3000 Turks dead. Hills took wind out of us, climbing them seemed impossible to charge up. Top like plateau & Austns scattered over it killed whilst charging, some riddled with bullets, skulls perforated. Sleeping in dugout with Miles & Wiggins. Sniping after armistice over. Austns in splendid & almost impregnable positions. Seems as if big movements of troops pending. Rumoured big fort (supposed Kilid Bahr)
