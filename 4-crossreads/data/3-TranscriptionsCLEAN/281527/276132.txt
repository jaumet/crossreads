that I sent the horses on ahead and walked over to Selles, there having a great yarn with the Lefevres and drinking the inevitable coffee. At mess had afternoon tea and listened to our new London records. At dinner had a good yarn to different officers as we sat round the fire. Some have recently returned from Paris in very good fettle - Lennon & Kennedy had their wives down there with them. After mess Charlesworth put a fire in the sitting room and worked there at odds and ends going into money matters with Froomes and getting a grip on the show generally. Quite a deal of correspondence to hand and more anguished Mother's letters to General Birdwood whose time must be well occupied by dealing with them all.
