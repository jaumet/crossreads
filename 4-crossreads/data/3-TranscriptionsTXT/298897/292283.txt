 Tuesday 30th May Reveille at 3.30 A.M. &amp; having everything all packed ready we were early on the road to Ferry Post.  We took up our possie in the Casualty Clearing Hospital tents as they had several empty &amp; were just moving off for Moaska.  We are to carry on the place until relieved by more Tommies.  Everyone appears to be ready to move off &amp; very anxious now. 
 Wednesday 31st May Managed to get leave in order to go up to Cairo &amp; draw some cash.  I caught the 8.30 P.M train arriving Cairo somewhere about 1. A.M. the train being late owing to a truck being on fire on the line.  We had our passes examined on the station by the [indecipherable] officer &amp; decided to put up at the Anzac Hostel a place run for soldiers only.  A Gany took us there in a few minutes &amp; after a small supper I turned in &amp; very pleased indeed was I to get into bed as the last two nights I had had very little sleep.  The beds were comfortable &amp; clean there being a great number arranged in a dormitory style.  After a wash shave &amp; boots cleaned operation I had breakfast costing P.T.S.
