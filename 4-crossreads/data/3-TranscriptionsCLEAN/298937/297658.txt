 Stopped at Montelimar & had a yarn with 2 French soldiers, wounded at Verdun. One was at the Peninsula & helped at the Australian evacuation. He thinks highly of the Australians. 
 Friday 18th Aug. 
 Passed Lyons in the night & breakfasted at Ma&ccedil;on.  Very cool in morning but as we neared Dijon the sun came out & it became warmer.  Rain finished.
