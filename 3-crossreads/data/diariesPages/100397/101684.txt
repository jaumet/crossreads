which I thank both yourself and Mother. There are not a great many flowers blooming now except poppies, marguerites and cornflowers there are plenty of those, still blooming in the fields. some of the gardens here have a few different flowers growing I do not know the names of them, there are some rather nice roses but none so fine as those we saw last year. some of the Small Woods here are very pretty most of the trees have been planted, and then others have grown naturally. there is one place about 4 miles away, that is very pretty. as you enter the wood from one side you find yourself in a long green aisle the branches of the trees meeting overhead. I suppose it has been left for a road then there are other similar leafy aisles Through the trees on the outskirts of the wood there a patches of strawberrys growing wild, it did not take our boys long to find them and sample the berries.
