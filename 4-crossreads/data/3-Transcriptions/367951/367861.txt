<p>Dear Beat &amp; Family<br/>Just a few lines hoping this finds you all well as it leaves me at present excepting that i have a bad cold and sore throat bur that is classed as nothing now. I have just finished reading the sunday times that one of my mates had sent over to him and i see their is some trouble about some of the soldiers wifes not receiving their allowances i do hope to god you are getting yours alright i was enjoying a rest in my dugout when i read it so i tell you it has upset me. Beat i have not got one of my old mates left now they are all gone some dead some wounded we have been having a pretty lively time lately it is nothing to see the sandbags flying all over the top of you their is a terrible lot loses their lives shifting when the shots are coming near them i just lay flat down and never shifts till they are finished i reckon you have more chance of getting hit shifting about than staying in one place. The children will not know me when i come home i am going as grey as a badger i have got to laugh at myself i think it is with catching louse it is nothing to take your shirt off and catch 15 or 20 louse any time any one of us is lousey you cannot help it the dugouts must be full of them they are like big crabs. we see aeiraplane fights prety nearly every day</p>
