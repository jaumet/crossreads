<p>June 1915<br/>after breakfast went on firewood fatigue.  Had a good sleep in the afternoon.  We were first supports at night, but there was nothing doing.</p>
<p>Thursday 3rd<br/>We were relieved out of the trenches at 12.30pm &amp; came out &amp; occupied dug-outs in shrapnel Gully.  We will have 3 days rest before we go in again.  At night we go into the supports.  There was heavy fire from the Turkish trenches at night.  The cruiser "Minerva" came round in the afternoon &amp; fired about 60 shots destroying an ammunition train, I believe.</p>
<p>Friday 4th<br/>Came back to our dug-outs at 5am.  I was on fatigue during the morning &amp; in the afternoon went down to the beach for a swim.  The water was pretty cold.  There was a big bombardment down near Cape Hellas</p>
