The place was very dirty fowls and ducks running about.
At 6pm to Saults for a drink and walked about till 8.30 and then dinner at Shepheards. While at dinner an officer reported to the General that soldiers were setting fire to natives goods in the streets. 
At 9.20 on the terrace noticed a glare and smell of burning and proceeded to the scene ? the commencement of the "red light" district. Two large 4 storey buildings were ablaze. The crowd was most orderly. The natives vanished like magic, all lights doused and shutters down. They have not forgotten previous treatment when a "battle" starts in the Wazir. The fire brigade seemed up to date and had a good pressure. After about 4 places (some very large) were gutted and others much damaged the fire got under control. The narrow streets in rear were 12 inches deep in water. The Yeomanry turned out, a cordon blocked all approaches and two squadrons were drawn up in front of Shepheards. We did not wait to see the completion of fire
