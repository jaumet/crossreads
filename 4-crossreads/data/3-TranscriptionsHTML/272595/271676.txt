<p>the rest.<br/>9th.  Have been doing a good bit of washing this afternoon.<br/>Trouble in the Orderly Room today over a few absentees, but I kept my end up alright, &amp; talked my way clean out of it, am getting a bit of a bush lawyer, but all the same theres trouble brewing<br/>10th.  More rows over the Dental people, from what I can gather, our Hqrs at "Bhurtpore" are shaking the Depots up about their slackness, &amp; I can tell you our heads have got the wind up properly, so every little chance they get now up go the men before Orderly Room, this is right enough in one way, but it should have been done long ago I never saw such an ill managed Camp before, its chiefly run by 3rd.</p>
