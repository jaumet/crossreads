<p>out of action, no gunners</p>
<p>1-8-1917<br/>Still raining, Major Olding seriously wounded. Two more of our gunners killed Gr Hargreaves and Rly Knight, both of A Sub. Vance is the No 1 of A Sub. Bdr Smyth got a few scratches on face. The guns just now are almost silent, a few isolated shots are all that can be heard. The Navy was bombarding the coast. The French also had a stunt. The gunners are coming to wagon line for a rest. The first stunt is finished. Result 300 prisoners, 8 officers and 10 machine guns The Manchesters did not gain their objectives, got cut up. The reason that we did not capture more prisoners was, we were the Pivot Division, the other divisions working on our right and left. Still raining 2-P.M. everything wet through. A horse that was reported killed arrived in lines, with an awful gash in neck just behind ears. This stunt was real Hell.</p>
