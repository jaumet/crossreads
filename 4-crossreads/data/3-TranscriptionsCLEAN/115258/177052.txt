A Cry from the Wilderness
To Sister Susie
Dear Susie, you've lived in Tasmania's fair isle
Midst peaceful surroundings in nature's fond smile
Whilst we have been fighting in dust and in heat
Or storming great mountains: The Hun foes to beat.
Of course for the empire you've well done your share
Growing apples in Tassy so rosy and rare
Still - I know you'll relent when you hear me complain
Of the ills you have done us  - Here let me explain.
 
Apple jelly is sweet and was prized by the crowd
Of men over here, and at first they felt proud
That Tasmania had sent it; but changed when they found
They were doomed to endure it, the dreary year's round.
A poor soul that's been damned and cast out into space
For ever in darkniss, its lone paths to trace
I blest beside us, if Jones continues to send
Apple Jelly unceasing, till this wicked war's end.
 
Since the subs have been sinking our shipping so free
Your apple exporting's gone all up a tree
But it's we have to suffer out here in war's zones
When you send all your apples via Hobart to Jones
Well the cure for al this I can print out to you
Your apples for export - just let the pig's chew
Dont keep them for jelly. Turn 'em all into ham
And in future tell Jones to send changes of jam.
Tpr. Willie.
