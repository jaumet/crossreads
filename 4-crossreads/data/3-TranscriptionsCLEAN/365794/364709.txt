  
 Friday 2 November 1917 T. 99.8, P. 76, T. 99.6 To have gr. I cal., no sleep but drowsy. Had P. of brom & chloral. hydrate 10 p.m. & got about 4 hrs. sleep but oh, for a natural one again. Day like all other days now.  Everyone kind but I feel more than ever the "thin cold wall" which I believe will forever separate us from the English & visitors are forbidden me so except for Sisters Lancer & Rogerson the day is a lonely one. Marge is sending a cable for me in case the Military have sent one to my dear little Mith & she might be worried.
