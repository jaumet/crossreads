<p>Tel &ndash;El- Kebir Egypt 15.4.1916<br/>Dear Mother,<br/>The above is my present address, but but may not be for long so letters for me had better be addressed to the Australian Base P.O. Egypt.  I want you to send five pounds (&pound;5.) of my money to Mrs E. W. Buckhitt, 79 Weinberg Road, Glenferrie Melbourne as she looks after her brother in law Chas. T. Buckhitt's affairs   &amp; he got &pound;10 cabled over   &amp; gave me half to save cabling expenses.  I will mention this matter in my next letter in case this one goes astray.  I may not be able to get back to my regiment owing to my long absence, but will let you know later if I join anything else.  We had a good but uncomfortable trip across from England,   &amp; I was glad to be able to get ashore at Gibralta   &amp; Malta.<br/>Love to all from<br/>Your affectionate Son Charlie<br/>N.B. To be censored.) Tpr Chas. R. Sherwin 500. 6th A.L.H. Regt.</p>
