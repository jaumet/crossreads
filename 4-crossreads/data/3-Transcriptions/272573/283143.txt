<p>Collected my gear to-gether getting ready for the way.</p>
<p>Dec 4th. Mon<br/>All the time I have been on leave the weather has been very wet, but to-day I am expecting to leave, the weather is of the finest.</p>
<p>The streets of Stirling are miserable at night time, more miserable even than the village streets near the line in France. The streets in Stirling are in all but utter darkness owing to the fear of aeroplanes bombing the town. Heavy fines are being exacted for breaches of the law in showing lights at night time.</p>
<p>Had tea at I in the evening. Left home to catch the 9.30 train to London.</p>
<p>Slept all the way to London.</p>
<p>Dec 5th. Tues</p>
<p>The train arrived two hours late. Took "Tube" to Charing Cross then taxi to Horseferry Rd, A.I.F. Headquarters to get the remainder of my gear. Took taxi to Waterloo Station. Got train to Romsey at 12.10 reaching Eastleigh 3.30 changed for Romsey at 4 o'clock. Found I had to walk a mile or two to the A.V.C. where I met Bob.</p>
<p>After having tea B &amp; I walked back to the village and after spending a few hours to-gether I caught my train back to London arriving there about midnight</p>
<p>I had great difficulty in getting a Taxi to take me to</p>
