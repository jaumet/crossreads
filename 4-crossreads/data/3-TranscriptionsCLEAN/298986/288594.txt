  
 Our jobs have all been changed.  L/C Turner has a burst of energy & has taken the cooking, I am cleaning 3 of the small rooms & back yard an easy job.  Turner has more rules for running the kitchen than the army.  These little jilos & squables are very funnie.  A batch of Aussie letters yesterday.  Went to a very good lecture by Norwood one night.  Weather has been mild.  Armistic Dinner for the troops today Wallnuts & applies besides plenty of meat & vegetables also
