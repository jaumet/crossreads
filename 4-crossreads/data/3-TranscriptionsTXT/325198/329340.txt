Ballad of Waney's Desperate Doings
Now Waney's an Australian, an Australian to the coreThe fighting blood  is in him & he comes to every warNow 'twas some where in Egypt that this desperado strayedIn fact I rather fancy he was 'on leave' in Port Said.
In a quiet secluded village, I think they call it Arab townWhere French damsels of ill virtue, & picquets hunt you downOld Waney wandered slyly carrying quite a dozen beersTill the cry of "Help us Aussie" made him prick up both his earsAnd girding up his loin cloth like Horatios of oldWith blue mettle in his pockets advanced with mien so bold
Now this awe inspiring spectre would the boldest man appalFor there stood three Light Horse men with their backs against a wallAnd facing them two Gippos with their wives & several sonsWere forcibly demanding payment for some current buns
