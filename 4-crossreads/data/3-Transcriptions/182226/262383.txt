<p>Monday 27 December, 1915</p>
<p>Went out to Piet&acirc; to see Mrs Grundy &amp; Paula. Took their photos &amp; had a good time. They all had to go out after tea so I stayed &amp; minded the house till they came home at about 9.30. We then stayed &amp; yarned till 11.30 when I started to walk home, 4 miles, I brought home a bottle of Scotch for the boys &amp; we all started&nbsp;in &amp; nearly finished it at about 1 a.m. when I got home.</p>
