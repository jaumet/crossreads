<p>learned that a number of enemy Zeppelins bombed the East end &amp; also Piccadilly way. A number were killed [20th October] &amp; this morning I saw from the train several of the places where the bombs had fallen. The houses were blown to heaps of broken bricks. It looks as if London is going to pass through a severe time during this moon, &amp; it is sincerely to be hoped, that a retaliation will be made in the form of overwhelming &amp; indiscriminate bombing reprisals. If this course is pursued vigorously, then it might so affect the morale of the enemy population as to materially shorten the war. At present the outlook is a pretty miserable one, &amp; it <strike>look</strike> seems as if things might go on as they are indefinitely.</p>
