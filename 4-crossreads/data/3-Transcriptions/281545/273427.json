<p>all helped to make a Beautiful Picture.  These small Glass Houses were very nicely laid out inside, they are all on Graves &amp; some have two chairs inside &amp; some beautiful Wreaths of Beads of various colours &amp; designs also several contained the Photo of the Deceased Person buried underneath.   I spent an enjoyable hour wandering about, at the top I came across several rows of French &amp; British soldiers Graves who had died in the Hospital in the Town, &amp; the graves are well looked after.   I saw two soldiers digging around them &amp; trimming them up.   I then went along &amp; came down the other side &amp; eventually came to the entrance &amp; went back over the Canal &amp; up into the Town being well satisfied with my Visit.   I was soon directed to the YMCA Hut &amp; there had a cup of cocoa &amp; had my lunch &amp; a rest for &frac12; an hour &amp; then walked quietly back to the station arriving there at 1.15 Pm &amp; at 1.37 we were off again for Bethune.   At each station there were an unusual number of civilians &amp; Soldiers travelling, it being Sunday.  Coming down we passed a Semaphore Signal at Danger by an order of the Chief Guard as a Train was in the Section ahead &amp; we had to proceed cautiously to the next Semaphore which also was at danger &amp; on another order we continued on slowly &amp; on taking a curve we could see the Train</p>
