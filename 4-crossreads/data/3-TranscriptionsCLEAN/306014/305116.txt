  
 finale after the service was over. 
 Strolling round after Church Service we met two nurses from the Salisbury Infirmary who seemed rather lonely, & we spent the next hour with them and caught the bus in time to get back to camp at 11.15. My nurse was rather young & had taken up her work since the outbreak of the war but could not get an appointment to a Base Hospital on account of her limited experience. She was very bright & had lovely pink cheeks, with dimples which showed themselves everytime she smiled, and as her manner suggested a good deal of culture & refinement we exchanged addresses. Of course an Australian in England can always speak to whom he likes, provided he behaves himself, & in this way we need never be at a loss when stranded in a strange city, & one has only to be careful & all is well.
