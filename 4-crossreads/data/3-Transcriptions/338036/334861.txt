<p>[7th Jan. contd]<br/>good time.  With the exception of a continual bombardment by our boys there was nothing doing.</p>
<p>Monday 8th  [Jan]<br/>[indecipherable]  came up for a bath today &amp; he told us that Fritz dropped about 70 [?] near R.A.P. this morn.  No casualties reported to date.  Very cold wind this afternoon.  Reced numerous papers tonight.</p>
<p>Tuesday 9th<br/>Very cold today.  Extra special bombardment tonight.</p>
<p>Wednesday 10th<br/>Saw a very [un] usual sight this afternoon.  Two of our observation balloons were up from midday (sausage type)  At about 4 pm I was working in the back of Baths near our Incinerator when a bright flare lit up the sky and looking in the direction was astounded to see the object diving to the earth from a good height leaving behind a wide trail of bluish black smoke.  At same time aircraft guns from all directions opened fire and it was then that I realized a German had settled one of our balloons.  Our guns gave him a hot time but he evaded them &amp; when over his own lines the enemy aircraft guns also opened fire giving the impression that he was disguised as one of ours.  It was a grand sight.</p>
