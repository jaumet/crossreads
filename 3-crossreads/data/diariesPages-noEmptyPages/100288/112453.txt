Saturday 8/4/16
Went with a number of others to railhead to finally pack our universal kits, as they are to be taken away from us. Packed necessary articles in white kit sent out to camp, at road head north, by ration limber. Were then allowed to proceed by desert train to Ferry Post, for a swim in the canal, which was very acceptable; also indulged very freely at the canteens. Returned to railhead at 5.45pm; arrive back at camp at 6.20 pm.
