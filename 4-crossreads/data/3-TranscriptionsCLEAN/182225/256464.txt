 1916   MONDAY 11   DEC. 
 Cold & it snowed most of the afternoon. I went over to Fargo & had my throat examined & reported on by the doctor over there, & he said pretty well the same as D r  Wylie did, but I could go through without an operation. Remaking stables in the afternoon. Got a wire from Mother in the evening to say she was coming to Salisbury in the evening.
