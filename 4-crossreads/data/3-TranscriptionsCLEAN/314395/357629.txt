gas burns.  The latest gas is invisible & has no smell, and one does not know it's over until seized with a fit of sneezing or else gets burnt by it.
Bryant Sheehy came to see me about a week ago, and he is looking splendid.  He has filled out a good deal.
I hope soon to visit some of the friends of the Husband of my Father's Sister;  as we are not very far from a certain town where mentioned in a couple of the addresses he gave me.  Furlough to England has started again, and I expect to go in about two months time.
Best wishes,Your affect. Son,George
