The machine immediately turned head on to the wind and volplaned towards the ground. It descended so easily and gracefully apparently under full control that we were in hopes that the pilot and Observer were uninjured but we subsequently heard that they were both killed. Our guns which had remained silent during the encounter now peppered the enemy planes with shells but all of the latter escaped uninjured.I received two long letters from Mother telling of her Brisbane trip but have no time to answer them at present.To-morrow we are leaving this portion of the front and going back for a rest for a few weeks. I don't think we will return here again. This does not convey much to you as I cannot tell you where here is.I am enclosing three photos on postcards and an enlargement in a separate envelope.I am not in love with any of them. Whilst our photograph was being taken we were surrounded by all the ruffians in the other two groups who were endeavouring to make us smile and aiming innumerable pleasantries at us and in ignoring them I have spoilt my photograph.
