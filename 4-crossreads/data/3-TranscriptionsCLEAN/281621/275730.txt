  
 Sunday 23 Mr. Winkler never cut a better figure on the ice than I did to-day on a pond. Nearly came several croppers but never mind. Beautiful weather 
 Monday 24 "B" Section's dinner last night was a complete success for Xmas. 
 Tuesday 25 2 pm. Snowing to-day & typically English. I have just seen the patients dinner dished out & everything turned out well. Patients all well pleased. Our meal tonight. The Dinner was O.K. but no one felt inclined for the concert after. The officers were in a snow fight for us & were rolled over & over in it. Some Xmas. 
 Wednesday 26 Still more snow, heavy. Not over the effects of last night yet. Yesterday, hardly a shot was heard & everything was peaceful, with the snow all over the ground. Heavy bombardment tonight German I think 
 Thursday 27 Snow still on the ground. Walk to Caestre to-day. A Section Bearers is up the line for raid. Roads very slippery & many wagons motor & horse have been ditched as a result. 
 Friday 28 A visit from Fritz by aeroplane this morning and a couple of bombs dropped near by. The Kookaburras are here again & the girl is better than ever 
 Saturday 29 Snow still covers the ground.
