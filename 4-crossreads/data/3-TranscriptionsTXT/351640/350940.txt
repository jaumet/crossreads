 many sentences about you, of your homes, of the travels of two of you, of how on Sunday afternoons you sang to me and played, the while I went off to sleep;   they were I think highly amused.  The Father is a commonplace old chap with an air of prosperity about him.   The Mother a tall woman about forty five years old, big head, massive verandah, not so projecting in other anatomical regions, small feet, low healed shoes;   she played the accompaniments to the songs which the Padre sang, soft and sweet.  A gentleman the Padre, clean in gown and appearance, a Count of France dating from the thirteenth century, his Father living in the ancestral home, where he has reared a family of ten children, my friend being the eldest.   There are five brothers fighting in France. &nbsp;&nbsp; I enclose the "Souvenir de la F&ecirc;te Annuelle de Charit&eacute;"; on the second sheet you will be able to read the words of a song which Marie sang.   The words are patriotic in incidence and were written for the present time; the musical setting was inspiring, the voice was sweet, and she made good use of it in a musical way.  The couple of hours were a complete change, especially as for so long my conversation and association have been with rough men, whose every word and wct [wit?] bespeaks the som soldier rather than the gallant; the difference was of such kind that it acted as a tonic to me.  They have asked me to call when they return from the seaside; I promised to do so should I be in Egypt.  Who knows where any of us will be in four weeks from now?   On the front of the pamphlet you will see the name of the sweet Marie.   I said that in this letter I should tell you about them.   One girl asked:   Will your daughters not be jealous?  No! I said, they will think kindly of you because you have been kind to me.   We left about 6 p.m. the Padre going to the college. 
 Good night now my dears.  These sheets will be placed in the post in the morning with benedictions requesting a safe and rapid passage to you.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah. 
 May fortune of the best be always with you, in the form of Gods blessings of every kind, health happiness and prosperity.   To Maria, and my other friends heaps of good wishes and kind regards.   Love in loads, and kisses, in abundance for each and all of you, from your loving and affectionate father John B. Nash
