 Wed. 22nd May (cont.) We left the Potsdamer in a crowded troop train, packed to suffocation. 
 Passed thru' Potsdam at about 2.40 pm. our peep showing us beautiful gardens and pretentious villas but saw very little really. 
 Arrived at Brandenburg, the big military town, at 3.30 pm. &amp; by tram and road we arrived at the lager (about 6 miles out) at about 4.30 pm. 
 The lager is an old brick mill or some such structure close by the Havel in open rye country. 
 A walk down a cobbled yard odorous of soup and Russkis and I faced a new type, the Unteroffizier. 
 He is quite a different person outside our lager which is exclusively for officers. 
 I was locked in a barbed-wire enclosure with a number of filthy Russians and a few sailors "homeward"-bound from Kommando.
