<p>How to run the war</p>
<p>Weve heard a fair amount of noise,<br/>On how to run the war<br/>Without undue extravance [extravagance?],<br/>But here's a little more,<br/>A lot of things you issue us<br/>In many ways are good,<br/>But even yet economy<br/>Is little understood</p>
<p>Our biscuits, now, for mending roads<br/>(Where metal reigns supreme)<br/>Or armour plating round the tanks-<br/>They'd make a bonzer scheme<br/>Or soaked for weeks in kerosene<br/>They might be used for fuel<br/>And save some hero from the cold<br/>When winter time is cruel.</p>
