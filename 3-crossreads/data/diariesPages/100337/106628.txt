Lüneburg is a rather large town, with about 30,000 inhabitants. The place is well laid out, The streets are nice & wide and along the footpaths are planted trees at intervals of about 10 yards apart, The roads are all built of rubble stones, and are kept in very good order & very clean. A large canal runs through the centre of the town & connects it with Bremen & Hamburg, It is about 200 kilometre from the Holland border & about 50 kilometres from Soltau. All houses are on the flat principle.
