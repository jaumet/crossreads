<p>France&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. 27.1.17<br/>29.11.16</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>After a fairly good time in "Blighty" for 9 days I reached my Unit again last Saturday.  I left Waterloo Station (London) at 4 o'clock the previous Tuesday with some other 1500 Tommies returning from leave like myself.  We did the 88 miles to Southampton in exactly 2 hours but did not leave the wharf till 8 P.M.  I slept most of the 8 hours it took us to cross to Havre &amp; then our troubles started.  Bumped from pillar to post, shoved into <u>rest</u> -camps here there &amp; everywhere (all the time without tucker) we finally on Friday morning about 6 a.m were finally "imyshed" out of the train some 14 kilometres from where our Unit was reported to be.  We footed it in &amp;reported, only to be told the Unit had moved a week previously.  On to another train which left that night &amp; had only got a few hundred yards</p>
