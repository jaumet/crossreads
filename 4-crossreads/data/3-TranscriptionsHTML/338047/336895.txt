<p>1918<br/>Nov 8<br/>how the shelling had missed it. There were shell holes in the open space surrounding the cathedral, but not one had touched it. The carvings and statues outside were protected by a wall of sandbags. Inside, things were left as in pre war times. An unexploded shell (one of our Archies it was believed) had come through the roof and gone into the floor partly lifting one of the slabs in the floor. This was the only damage that I could see. We spent some time examining the statues and chapels, and the pulpit, and then went up the Town. The streets were wide and planted with trees that were beginning to lose their leaves. Shopkeepers were making a brave attempt to restart business in their shattered shops. One arcade was very lively with stalls etc. I bought some views of the Cathedral there. We retraced our steps through another street back to the station. Some of the less battered shops were apparently going strong.</p>
