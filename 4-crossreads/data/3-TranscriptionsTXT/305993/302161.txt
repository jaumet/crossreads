 We brought across from Batun Russia, Prince &amp; Princess -- &amp; maid.  Their Castle having been burnt &amp; completely destroyed also their furniture by the Russian Boselvesks.  The Prince being a Russian Georgian the Princess a Italian Cinoma artist formally.  They told me that their former estates were large &amp; the income large &amp; that his castle contained 60 servants.  Now his property is conviscated &amp; also his title &amp; all rights to eane in Russia.  But like the rest of the high officials he has money invested in other countries.  He is on his way to Florence, Italy.  Sad &amp; gloomy his pride like many more a thing of the past &amp; treated as a ordinary passenger.  Yet very gentle in their way.  This day we discharged the mails &amp; sent out a odd tin trunk which was sent aboard in Batun.  I discharged the mails &amp; Trunk, the lot went ashore in the Patrol boat in charge of a Sargeant &amp; Corporal &amp; obtained signatures on way bills.  An hour afterwards the O.C. of troops Colonial Forbes approaches me &amp; asked me what I had done with the specie.  I told him I knew nothing of any specie.  It appears this Tin trunk had been sent aboard with the mails at Batun as a ordinary trunk &amp; contained one million Pounds of notes.  So a guard was sent ashore after it &amp; Colonel Forbes cleared me as they at Batun should have notifered us &amp; then it would have been locked up in the ship's strong room &amp; not put amongst the mails.  "All's well so that ends well".  The Cash reached its destination like we won the war.  Blunders.  At 9 p.m. we left Constantinople for Port Said.  No troops &amp; no cargo.
