Saturday, 9 October, 1915In the rear of our dressing stn is a shallow trench that leads right out to Walkers Ridge.  As men used to go in this trench the Turks used to snipe them, but desisted for some time and the men got careless but to-day a party were going in and a sniper saw them and shot two one right through the heart and the other through the leg, I dressed the leg wound immediately but by the time the other chap was brought in he was dead.  He was buried at night.  The Dr as usual was nowhere to be found all day.  It is reported that the Turks have used gas on the Indians on the right, and the order has come for each man to have his respirator in readiness.  If the Turks use gas it is their last resource.
