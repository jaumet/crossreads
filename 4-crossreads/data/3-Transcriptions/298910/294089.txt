<p>the Operating Tent was about 75 yds away &ndash; A lot of the Doctors &amp; <u>tent Division</u> who have never been near the firing line, were in a blue funk.</p>
<p>Sunday  12/11/16</p>
<p>Dull &amp; foggy. Heavy bombardment continues &ndash; a lot of "Furphys" knocking about, that Bapaume has fallen but I can't believe it &ndash; we have had nothing officially &ndash; Very few lying down cases in. Got a party to take my place for a while as I heard there was to be Benediction etc in the Village Church of "Meault" which is about 3 miles away &ndash; The Rosary etc started at 5.30 &ndash; the Church was crowded mostly by that very fine body of men of Irish Guards &ndash; with a smattering of Irish Australians &ndash; finished up by singing the grand old Hymn Glorious St Patrick.</p>
<p>Taubs come over this way nearly every night &amp; turn on machine Guns around the Camp, believe our airmen have retaliated &amp; given him fits.</p>

<p>Fine &amp; Frosty. Very busy all day. 1st &amp; 2nd Division went over last night &amp; took three lines of trenches &ndash; Fritz counter attacked very heavily but they managed to get up reinforcements</p>
