<p>lively when once aboard the lugger.  There is nothing to write about now.  I just fill in the time as pleasantly as possible &amp; as Ellis will tell you I am not allowed to leave Camp.</p>
<p>I must go down to the Y.M.C.A. for a cup of Tea &amp; a bit of cake.  The food we get is plentiful but the old story that "God sends food &amp; the Devil sends cooks" still prevails &amp; most of the food is spoilt.</p>
<p>Soon I shall be meeting you all &amp; Oh! I just had a spasm of excitement.  What a time, what a re-union.  I try not to think about it, for fear the time seems weary &amp; long.</p>
<p>Best Love to you all<br/>Harry</p>
