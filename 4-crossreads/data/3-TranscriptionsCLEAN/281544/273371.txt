  
 in the Rue de Havre, in we went & made inquiries & was offered a Room with a Double Bed in it, the only room left for 5 Franc including Breakfast each which was very reasonable. We both had a couple more drinks each & being very tired we decided to turn in & have a good sleep, so up we went to the Room, & what a lovely bed there was in the Room, it had 3 Mattresses on it, & my Mate reckoned he was going to stop in it all the next day it was so comfortable, we was soon in Bed & fast asleep & neither moved until we were called at 8 am when we had hot water brought up to us to wash & at 8.30 down we went for Breakfast, both feeling A.1. after our good night's rest, the French Lady had Breakfast set for us in the Kitchen by a big Stove & it was nice & warm, we had Fried Eggs again & a Pot of Tea, which was the best. Tea we had had for many a long day, we both had 3 Cups each, (small ones) & French Bread & Butter, the Bread I enjoyed a.1.
