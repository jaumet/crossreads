<p>to Australia in a month or, so. Should love to be home for Xmas or New Year   &amp;  get away from this awful Winter.</p>
<p>I cannot run anymore risk on the sea than we have done on land. So don't worry about me, everyones life is in danger in these parts.</p>
<p>It is Sunday-morn   &amp;  I have a day-off duty, getting up now   &amp;  going to 10.45 a.m. church so much stop.</p>
<p>Love to all my friends. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all.  From</p>
<p>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith</p>
