 " My Creed " Becaus I hav ?nt a creed in the world As creed in the creed book go There are those who hold me condemn by God As I am by them below . 2 But I feel , if I read the stori right Of the Man of Bethlehem , I would rather trust my soul to His Love Than sit and be judg by them 3 For creed at best are man made thing And man is mortal and vain And apt , if a sinner he sit to judg To break his own creed in twain . 4 But the Lord look straight in the heart of men And He judg our live aright And He doe ?nt care for the creed you bare But the motiv you have in sight 5 For a thousand creed which preach of Christ Are full of their own conceit And the line of demarc is wide Where God and the creed book meet 6 I hav ?nt a creed that a Church would own But I reckon the Lord of Love Will open the Gate , if a chap live straight And find him a place abov .
