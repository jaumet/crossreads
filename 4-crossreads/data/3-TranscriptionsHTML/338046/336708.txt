At last we came to the Somme canal, on the outskirts of the town, bordered by tall trees and turning to the left walked along the tow path passing occasionally a post held by our company. At last we reached Company HQ and I rejoined my mates, who were very pleased to see me, as I was to see them. We were on an island connected with the mainland by a bridge. The lagoon on which the island was, ran parallel with the canal, of which it had evidently been part. The canal and lagoon together formed the Somme River. As the battalion was still to remain in the line, another nucleus was sent out the next morning. Nesbitt going from the signallers. As the island was marshy it was impossible to dig down, so all the shelters were altogether above ground. We had a good supply of blankets and pillows (kindly supplied by the town) one of which I brought home, also ornaments from some of the better class houses.</p>
