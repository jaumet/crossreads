<p>The sun has had a little warmth in its beams the last day or so &amp; it surely can't go on being cold for ever.</p>
<p>Everything is frozen, ice inches thick, ground like iron &amp; everything white.</p>
<p>All the papers have been talking of the intense cold, it has been down to 19&deg; Fahrenheit.  Bed is the best place really but its an awful wrench arising.</p>
<p>We have been doing some more prancing round the country.  Left the little village where we rested (?) and ambled to another village where we stayed a couple of days.  Nothing startling there only work.  Then on Sunday we ambled on &amp; arrived here (back in the line) in the afternoon.  Moving isn't so bad for me now I have got out of that Brigade Clerk job &amp; I have a bike all to myself &amp; can choose my own pace &amp; route.</p>
<p>Here I have a fairly decent dug out &amp; a fire place in it &amp; as there is a shell damaged wood close handy with plenty of fallen timber I have a fire going &amp; I am getting along very</p>
