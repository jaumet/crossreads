<p>sick.  The doctor sent me to Hospital &amp; after waiting about for six hours, find myself here in No. 26 Gen. Hosp. (English) &amp; small chance of getting out.  Hospital of huts &amp; large tents, very cold.  From here a fine view of the sea on one side &amp; Paris Plage (favourite sea-side resort) on the other.  Straight to bed &amp; feel too comfortable to believe it true, this bed is a change from sand.</p>
<p>Oct. 29th &ndash; Sunday<br/>Raining &amp; high winds blowing but I am in bed until 1 p.m. &amp; then get out.  No good to me lying in all day.  Not examined by doctor</p>
