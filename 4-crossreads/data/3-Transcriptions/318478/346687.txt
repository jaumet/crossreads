<p>Dear Mick</p>
<p>For the past 7 days we have been more or less stranded at Chanak on the Asiatic side of the Gate of the World.  Snow Blizzards, Ice &amp; general discomfort.  No coal or wood and a damp gloomy fifth rate house called the Lion Hotel, may I live to forget it.</p>
<p>Apart from the delay &amp; the temperature this place is interesting &amp; the surrounding country very beautiful &amp; fertile and not at all what one is led to believe from the geographical lessons of childhood which gave me the impression that Asia was barren rocks &amp; desert.</p>
<p>The Turks here are a most murderous looking lot but awfully like Gilbert &amp; Sullivan opera.  The troops (British) in occupation here have established themselves fairly well &amp; there is a theatre when a jolly good imitation review is performed by remarkably able soldier actors.</p>
<p>I have managed to make four sketches, quite passable, of points of interest but we look over towards Anzac &amp; I</p>
