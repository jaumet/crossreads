<p>15/8/19 Chemnitz<br/>Although the weather was fine we ran into heavy seas this morning and all the recently recovered sea sick people soon collapsed again. Found on the inspection down in the lower decks the air was thick enough to make one squeamish. There were fewer complaints about food today though bread was one item. New &ndash; that is all that is wrong with it. Some of these complaints are made by criminals and cold footers and makes one feel inclined to hurl the offending bread, stew or whatever it is at their miserable heads.</p>
<p>16/8/19 Much smoother today. On inspection this morning found all pretty correct. The ship is getting very monotonous and we shall not be sorry to reach home. The wind was howling and whistling all night &ndash; a wild night at sea.</p>
