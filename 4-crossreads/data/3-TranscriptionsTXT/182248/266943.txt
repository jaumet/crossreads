 Hotel. There will be about 150 present, and I&#39;m going to have a real gay time. Unfortunately, Ailsa cannot come. I&#39;m terribly sorry. But I&#39;ll let her see that I can enjoy myself without her help. But I wish she were coming all the same. 
 Col.Ryrie, Col.Cox, Col.Harris, Col. Arnott, Major Rutledge, Capt.Keith Miller, and I went round to Ailsa&#39;s place on Tuesday for Afternoon Tea. It was a most pleasing function. There were a few very nice ladies there - refugees from Palestine and Syria. One little girl her is a refugee from Nazareth. &quot;Dear old Nazareth&quot; she calls it and is always wanting to go back there. 
 Had a glass of Cherry Brandy last week (purely medicinally of course). Little Mary misbehaved for one day only. Must have taken something that disagreed with her. A gentleman in Maadi assured me that Brandy was the best thing in the world for her. I agreed. It was. Awfully nice. Mary improved immediately. If I had known brandy was so nice I wouldnot have refused so many thousand glasses during the past ten years. However I suppose its too late to start now. 
 The last mail brought a splendid batch of correspondence to me. Thanks awfully all of you. It lies on my bunk a most welcome bundle. It was a treat to read it through and through. (Two from you this time Mabel, Merci.) (Jean, my dear you&#39;re a wit. At least you possess that charming faculty for presenting your ides - such as they are - in an original fashion. Keep on I may make a scribe out of you after all). I&#39;m busy of late so I&#39;m unable to reply individually except by post cards - therefore this letter will have to go the rounds. By the bye I&#39;m afraid there is some misconception somewhere. I really believe that Leoda and Vic and Linda and Else think I&#39;m too busy to read any letters that they may send. This is quite a fallacy. I&#39;ll find time even if I have to get up in the middle of the night to read them. That&#39;s an &#39;int. 
 Hitherto I&#39;ve refrained from mentioning our destination. But so much has appeared in the press about the Expeditionary force for the Dardanelles that there can be no harm in my mentioning that we believe we are going to the Dardanelles to combine with the Naval force in capturing Constantinople and smashing up the Turks. It is bound to be a great exploit - quite the most spectacular in the whole war. Hitherto the Dardanelles have been looked upon as absolutely impregnable. But the Turks have had the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmora too long. They have run riot in Europe far too, long - so they will haveto quit. The Russians will attach from the Black Sea and the North, while the French and English will come in from the Dardanelles and the South. By the time the plan is fairly moving it is probable that the Greeks will take a hand. But the King and the Court party have so far been able to block Venezelos and the nation. If Greece does not butt in she will lose her chance of getting the rich territory in Asia&nbsp;Minor that she so long coveted. The Germans up till recently did a great deal to help fortify Turkey and sent enormous quantities of arms and ammunition. But lately there has been nothing through from the North. The way is blocked. And Germany wants all she has for her own use. But we hear that great preparations are being made for our rece i ption by the Turks. It&#39;ll be fine fun marching through Constantinople. We expect the fighting to be short sharp and decisive. Then&nbsp;
