     I got a telephone message at Helouan Hospital (Egypt) at 12 
 Noon on Sunday 26th March 1916 that my unit ( 9/17 ) was to move out 
 at 7 a.m. next morning from Heliopolis and I had no hesitation in 
 telling them that I would be with them when they moved.  Under ord- 
 inary circumstances I would have been discharged from the Convales- 
 cent Hospital within two days and would then have had to go to the 
 "Overseas Base" and from there to some strange unit and possibly 
 stay in Egypt for months.  We were particularly lucky to get away 
 so soon as a lot of the earlier reinforcements to the 17th Batt. 
 were still in Egypt.  Plenty of men had been in Egypt 5 months and 
 never had a move.  Instead of making the 9th Reinforcement we will 
 probably form the 1st Reinforcement to the 17th Batt.  I went over 
 to Heliopolis where the 9/17 were camped on Sunday afternoon to make 
 all arrangements and returned to Helouan in the evening to get my 
 discharge from Hospital, luggage etc.  Coming back to Cairo about 11 
 p.m. I got a motor car from the Railway Station to take me right 
 out to the Camp (about 10 miles) but after it had gone a mile or so 
 in trying to avoid another car coming round a corner it ran over the  
 pavement and smacked a wall.  The wall came off best so I had to 
 transfer my baggage and self to another car.  The run out to Helio- 
 polis is very pretty even at night and the road is perfect - as a 
 matter of fact, Australia (and Particularly N.S.W.) is the only 
 place I have seen which has bad roads.  Arriving at Camp. I found 
 my old orderly had made a bunk up for me in a tent so I turned in 
 for a couple of hours - the only occasion on which I had slept 
 in camp in Egypt.  Reveille went at 2 a.m. breakfast at 3am. and
