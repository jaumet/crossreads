<p>Tuesday 7 May</p>
<p>Last night it fell my lot to do gas guard.   Sat on a chair in a perfectly dark barn like central part of the hop place, listening to shells for two hours.</p>
<p>Then I went over to the living room &amp; found Baird doing his vigil with a magazine &amp; a solitary lamp.  We made some coffee &amp; had a yarn then I returned.</p>
<p>By then it was half past three &amp; beginning to get light so I strolled round the road, watched</p>
