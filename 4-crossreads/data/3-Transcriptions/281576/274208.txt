<p>Sat. Apr. 28.  Dodson, Bayliss &amp; Nash went away on Leave this morning, which makes me 8th on the List now.  After Dinner we found that no wagon was obtainable to take us to Mametz; so rang up Major Bond who promised to send along some  vehicles.  About 3 p.m. Normy Adams, Jack Edgar &amp; Stan Wilson left, with our "Props" in a Tip dray.  At 6 p.m. the remainder of the "N.B.s" left some in a Limber &amp; the others in a Maltese Cart, both from the 59th Batt.  <br/>The Y.M.C.A. Hut was crowded &amp; our Show went off tip-top.  Maj. Bond greeted us on our arrival.  Maj. Clayton &amp; Capt. Riley were also there.  After the Show, Mr King of the Y.M.C.A. &amp; the Padre gave us a slap up Feed, Fried Sausages  Bread &amp; Butter, Cakes &amp; Cocoa.  After that Maj. Bond took us up to the officers' Mess &amp; produced some Fire Water.  The officers of the 59th are a jolly decent crowd &amp; they gave us a good time.  Plenty of Whisky &amp; actually Schweppes Soda.  I'm glad to say that our Crowd played the Game &amp; arrived back Home at midnight quite alright.</p>
<p>Sun. Apr. 29th  Glorious, sunshining day.  Our crowd are football mad.  They have played 2 or 3 games a day lately but have lost every one.  Maggs, Wally Saunders, &amp; a no. of others are suffering from Injuries &amp; today our W.O. Roberts was admitted to Hospital with a sprained ankle.</p>
