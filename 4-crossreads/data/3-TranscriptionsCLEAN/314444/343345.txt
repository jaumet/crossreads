  
 The sunsets here were beautiful to see. I stood several times for an hour at a time watching Sunset. Columbo was a[n] interesting place The first touch of Oriental life. No troops were allowed off. This order made the men wild they took the matter in their own hands. All round the ship were native boats of all sizes selling their wares. Curios mostly, & diving for money. These people are terrible cadgers They got very cute besides wanting prices a dozen times the value of an article they got cute enough not to dive for copper coins
