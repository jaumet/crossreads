 1915 June 2 Wed. At Gezira Palace showers have been fitted up &amp; I am therefore able to get one every morning &ndash; first since the salt showers on the Kyarra although hot &amp; cold water baths have always been available. We are some style in the Office &ndash; draw the necessary sundries from the kitchen &amp; make tea at 11 a.m. &amp; 4 p.m. every day. And very nice too! Socking big mail arrived including a lot of delayed letters. I have put up a new record for a week having received since Sunday:- 29 letters, 4 papers, 1 packet printed matter, 3 newspaper cuttings, 3 cards. Something to do to reply to all.
