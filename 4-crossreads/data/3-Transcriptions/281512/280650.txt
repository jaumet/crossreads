<p>8th September.  Saturday<br/>All day with the 28th Brigade, 2nd Division, near Renescue.  Col. Reid gave me every assistance in his power and arranged routine drill for the camera &amp; Cine.  The men are practically all W. Australians. Their training reflects credit on their commanding officer, the men are well disciplined, their evolutions resembling a great machine. They performed exercises with the bayonet, Physical drill, Lewis gun exercise, &amp; Signal Exercise etc. with a perfectness only attained by continued training &amp; rigid discipline. The men are in fine fettle &amp; will give an account of themselves in the very near future.  Wintry conditions are beginning. The leaves are turning Autumn tints &amp; the atmosphere is assuming the typical fogginess of winter. The Hay is being stacked &amp; the ground retilled. The country looks beautiful.</p>
