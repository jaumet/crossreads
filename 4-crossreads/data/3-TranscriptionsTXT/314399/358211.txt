 Saturday 2 August 1919 Boat pulled away at 11.30 am &amp; pulled up waiting for the tide at 1.30 pm. Had another bonny letter from Janet. Sent her just a note just before I got hers. Went on duty at 9 am. Gee it was funny. Nobody knew where the posts were. Had to get a ships officer to show me them all. The meals on board are very good. 
 Sunday 3 July 1919 Slept very well last night. Finished guard at 9 am. Do me too. Bonny weather still. Took some Gregory's. Slept nearly all day. Had a boat drill parade today. Am in charge of a boat with 33 men.
