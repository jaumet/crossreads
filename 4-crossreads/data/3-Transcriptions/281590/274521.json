<p>22nd March 1918<br/>doubling &amp; redoubling on itself, we camped at Talat ed Dumm &amp; continuing the zig-zagging, horse-shoeing shaped road (an old Roman road) where a side slip may have meant a fall of 300 ft we camped on flat of Jordan valley about 4am. B'fast at 5am &amp; ready to shift. Jericho about 3 or 4 miles distant. About 9am we commenced to move towards pontoon bridge. Had dinner close &ndash; handy &amp; got snaps of bridge. Light bad for photography. Kept moving &amp; about 5pm passed [Indecipherable] &amp; part of 2nd Bde near a Circassian Bedouin camp. Circassian Bed-Village blanketed like Arab Bedouin Described fully in letters. Still kept on moving and altho' the travelling was [Indecipherable] we had to push on &amp; at 8am on 25th we camped for an hour nearly all wet thro', all feet soaked &amp; ate a breakfast minus tea in pouring rain. then pushed off again &amp; took till 6pm to cover two miles, camels slipping sliding all directions &amp; one point especially where soil shallow &amp; on smooth rock. Picked up 2nd Bde 7pm which had arrived there previous night &amp; after tea, groom or rub camels backs etc at 9pm got going on what proved much better travelling in good moonlight. About 4am it rained again &amp; at dawn we found we were near a Turks Circassian village Na-aur  (pronounced Na-ooo) Village flat roofed, fair size and semi-cemented walls &amp; in some instances garden on top. Inhabitants whiter looking &amp; looked more like upper class Gyppo  &amp; looked as if the Turks also had reps. there. We had breakfast there leaving about 10am &amp; joining up Bde about 2pm near Ain le Sur. Instances of surprise were numerous. Turks &amp; Germans being</p>
