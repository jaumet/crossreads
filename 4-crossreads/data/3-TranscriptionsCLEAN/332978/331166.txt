There are 60&#37; of senior officers in this camp now, mostly captains of considerable experience & several years captivity - Some have barbed wire itis & talk nothing but shop all day long - The camp is quite different now a lot of the young officers in receipt of huge salaries, are conspicuous by their absence. - 
 Attended church tonight 
 Russia is demanding an immediate armistice & peace. Their Govt & Military leaders have been locked up & the country is being run by labour & soldiers' unions, the country generally is in an awful state of chaos. It is almost certain that russia will conclude a separate peace. Italy is steadily losing more men by the thousands, generally speaking things are looking rather serious. The best thing we can do is to conclude peace, & not be sold a pup by our rotten allies. English & French troops are being sent to Italy -
