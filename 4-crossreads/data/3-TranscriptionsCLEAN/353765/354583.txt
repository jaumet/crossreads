  
 March 1916 [Note in margin:] Friday 18th - Went up to see Bill P. in 5th L.H. Straggling mail in. Got two bundles of couriers, very recent date, apparently new mail. 11th - Good mail in. Letters from Mater, Dad Molly (2) & Mag. P. also usual batch. [Note in margin:] Sunday 12th - Went to 'other denominations' church service, don't know pilots name, wouldn't go nap on him. Too much Gertie about him. 13th - SSgt went up to Ismalia for drugs taking Disprose with him, Provo Colonel collared Dip out of 2.30 pm train & told piquets to book him. Ridiculous charge of being in 2nd compt on 3rd ticket. Dip. missing till afternoon of 14th when escort brought him back needless to say, he was acquitted. Understand Colonel taking matter up. [Note in margin:] Wednesday 15th - Corps order issued saying Everybody must attend 2.30 pm parade in drill dress order. Quite unnecessary. Doesn't it hurt. Large movements of troop's 15th - apparently taking place. Five steamers passed up canal within an hour & troop trains ? running all night. 6th A.S.C. being split up & turned into Div. supply Co. & their Tports being allotted to Bde regts. Rumours very prevalent saying all Austn mail to be held in Cairo for six weeks. Understand we are to be put on bully beef etc from tomorrow. Everyone wondering if L.H. are to be left behind or not. Popular belief is that all the infantry are going to France. Maybe only 1st & 2nd divs. They are certainly going somewhere. Weather getting decidedly warm. Posted letters to Mater Molly. Dad & Ede. All mail up to date. 16th - Usual routine of work. 17th - A. Section went to Salt Lake. Swam horses & had good time. Windy all day, so I stayed at Serapeum. No wind at Lake. 18th - Worst day of all so far. Wind & dust continuously blowing. Dispensary
