<p>in all directions.   It was a shameful sight as some civilians still remain &amp; dare not leave the house a moment lest it be ramsacked.   One woman of a good house went to have lunch at another house returning an hour later to find the place broken up &amp; everything looted, beds upset &amp; clothing taken, locks broken off &amp; her entire stock of 11 fowls taken besides the Mother of a few days old rabbits and yet the penalty for looting is supposed to be death.   I blame the Authorities for not picketing the town but perhaps they think it better to pay what damage is claimed rather than spare a few men for the job.  It is certainly making ill feeling between the French &amp; ourselves which added to the ill feeling between a section of the Australians &amp; Tommys makes things very topsy turvy.   An English officer told me that our fellows when taking over called the Tommys all the insulting names they could imagine accusing them of funking &amp; shewing the white feather.   Such conduct is disgraceful &amp; yet many of our officers encourage it.</p>
