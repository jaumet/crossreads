 1916   TUESDAY 24   OCTOBER 
 Fine & fairly warm. Well the inspection came off & we put up another show. Campbell being absent made things worse. Went through the riding school in the afternoon & it was on a par with most of the other things in the military - a farce. Got the long looked for letter from Linda with the "wee confession" in it. It could not have come on a better day, as I wanted something to cheer me up as I was fed up with the whole show after the exhibition we put up today. Oh Lord what wouldn't I give to be out with her for some time again. Heard that M rs  Clyde was coming over to see Clyde when he came on leave.
