<p>We had a dust storm all day.  Simply awful.  The air was full of sand.  We could only see about 20 yds before our eyes.</p>
<p>29th March Monday 1915</p>
<p>Another very bad day.  The Reinforcements tramped 3 miles into the desert through blinding suffocating clouds of sand &amp; built a rifle range.  The other troops were reviewed by Sir Ian Hamilton who is now in supreme command over the Australian forces.  In the evening went into the Temple of the Sphinx.  A moonlight night at the Sphinx &amp; Pyramids is beautiful.</p>
