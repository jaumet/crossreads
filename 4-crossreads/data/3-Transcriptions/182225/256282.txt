<p>1916 &nbsp; MONDAY 12 &nbsp; JUNE</p>
<p>A fair day but a bit cool &amp; there were a few showers. They started coaling from lighters in morning &amp; were at it all day. They coaled with niggers &amp; there were some cases amongst them. We gave them some roast beef &amp; put a lot of cayenne pepper in it, they eat it all and some minutes after they began to rub their bellies as the pepper was burning them. We went for a row in one of the ships boats in the afternoon. We went round the &quot;Benalla&quot; with the 35<sup>th</sup>/ &nbsp;NE &amp; some AMC men on her and round the pier &amp; back to the ship. It was a great change. Everybody very excited as there is a roumer we go ashore tomorrow.</p>
