<p>It was very good of you &amp; I am looking forward to getting things but you &amp; Will were both so very good to me that you really aught not to have sent me any thing. Will you please make up a story to fit the pictures I am going to send Peter in a letter. I hope you will like making up the story &amp; do the artist justice. I am only about a mile from the Battalion in which I expect Grahame Garland is, so hope to look him up one of these fine days.<br/>No more news- so au-revoir<br/>With much love to you all<br/>Ever your loving brother,<br/>Fred</p>
