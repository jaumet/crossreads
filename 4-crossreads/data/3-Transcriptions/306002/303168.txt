<p>30.5.15<br/>Sun. 30th.  My cold rather bad last night so I did not get out at 3.30 &amp; slept till dinner time.  Soon after dinner we had the order to pack our gear ready to move off.  At 1 o'clock our boys from <strike>Popes Hill</strike> Quinns Post charged the Turks &amp; captured a machine gun, a two lines of trenches, there is some doubts as to whether they will be able to hold them or not.  We received orders to attach ourselves to B Troop till further orders &amp; were then put in the trenches on the right side of Popes Hill &amp; told that the Turks had been heavily reinforced &amp; an attack was expected before the moon rose (about midnight).  Two of our aeroplanes have been scouting all day &amp; it was a fine sight watching them as the Turks were trying to bring them down with shrapnel but with no success.</p>
