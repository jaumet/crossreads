 You will all be sorry to learn that I am sick. A beastly nuisance. For how long to be? How long??? If any serious change, which involves danger, comes into the sickness the authorities will keep you advised of my condition Failing such news you may assume that I am all right. Before this reaches you, if I be recovered you will receive a cable message from me, and all will be well. 
 Not much good at writing today, the spirit is willing but the muscles of my arm will not keep driving the pen. Pray forgive me. 
 Tell Mollie please that, as the mail closes here this afternoon, there may be no letter for her dated this week. Say a prayer sometimes for a poor old man, if you please?
