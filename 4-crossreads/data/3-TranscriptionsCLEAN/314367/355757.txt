  
 By Jove it was funny - I laughed till I cried - Fancy taking white cockatoos to Australia!! - He wanted them up on the poop - Bumpus & I swore we'd send them adrift inside 10 minutes & we would too - Eventually he got them away forward & pays a man to look after them - After this - quiet - cider - at Walker's expense - & bed - 
 Friday 11th/15   Up 6 am - Swim - Sick parade - To the beach at 9.15 - Up to the Hosp - Saw PMO - So long as he gives me a chit to say where the quinine has gone I don't care a damn - It will save me trouble - He says he can get me more-I don't know whether he can - I'm to see him tomorrow - Down to the pier - Met Lauris - took him inboard - Got the Chief Engineer & we made Soda W in his presence & sold him the lot for 15 - Then I took him up & liquored & oiled him at the expense of the mess - I'd have sold the Gramophone only that bally ass Nelson has broken
