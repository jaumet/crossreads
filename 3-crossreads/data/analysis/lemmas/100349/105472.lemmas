 heavili from the shell dure the night . My arm is veri stiff and pain from the crack I receiv on the shoulder . We may be releiv tonight . 6/10/17 Was releiv by the 10th Battalion last night , in furious rain and wind . The guid got lost . I lead the compani out , or rather they follow me ; for after we got flounder in the march it was " sauv qui peut . " Got out to our old posit in Reserv , where I seiz a " Bon " posit in a concret "pill Box" , a vast improv on the mud hole . There is plenti of tucker , and feel the better of a good sleep. I do believ the Hun deliber tri to do for me in that last stunt . The wall of this " Pill Box " are four feet thick , and are strong reinforc with steel rail and bar . This space insid is onli about four feet high .
