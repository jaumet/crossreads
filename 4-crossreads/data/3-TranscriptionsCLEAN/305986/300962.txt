No charger prances or [indecipherable] glancesOr Pennants wave before themThey creep and crawl with slow advanceWith ooze and sluice all o'er themThe days are done of battles wonBy cavaliers bold ridingToday we aim to beat the hunBy artfulness in hiding
But deeds as bold as e'er of oldAre done on fields more bloodyAnd times recording page may holdThis knights all stained and MuddyWho Volunteer and Valiant stand
