<p>in evening.</p>
<p>8th June (Thursday) Making top for drainage pit. Sports meetings coming off on Saturday and Tuesday. We unanimously prefer entering these with the 8th Brigade rather than as combined divisional A.M.C. Read out in orders that if any more canteen riots occur these places will be shut. A shock went through the lines today when news of Lord Kitchener's death came to hand.<br/>Y.M.C.A. at night.</p>
<p>9th June (Friday)<br/>Sports meeting held in our unit to pick representatives</p>
