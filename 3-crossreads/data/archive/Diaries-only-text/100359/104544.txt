MAY 1916
Monday May 1st 
On picquet. The rest of the crowd went out to the Sphinx to build a bit more to the dressing Station. Weather jolly hot.
Tuesday 2nd 
Told off to escort 4 patients into the clearing hospital, with Bricky Mason. We got in there at about 10.30, then we went into Ismalia. Strolled round the town made a few purchases and had dinner which was a jolly good change. It was a treat to walk around the shady streets, after being stuck out in the desert so long. We got back to Camp at tea time, of course the rest of the crowd just returned from Sphinx. Got a long letter from Cis. wrote in return.
Wednesday 3rd
On fatigue duty around the camp. Tom Davies and I were sent out about 3 miles in the Desert to bring in some Iron work off the stone boxes left behind by camel trains. In the evening Capt. Nance gave us a lecture on "the composition of a division" but he knew less about it than we did. Then he took us for a stroll up Hog's Back Hill and told funny stories.
Thursday 4th 
Yesterday it was posted up about Gen.Townshends party surrendering in Mesopatania. Things are getting worse than ever. This morning Capt. Irving informed us that there was a big body of Turks near the outpost, but we took it as a big joke. We started out for Sphinx in the morning but only got as far as the Engineers? camp, as we could not get any sand bags.
Friday 5th 
Great excitement in Camp, Big body of Turks said to be advancing on the Canal. Light Horse and Infantry flying around everywhere. We got orders to move our camp back about a mile as we were too near the firing line.
