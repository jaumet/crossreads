The moaning of the poor fellows was awful to listen to, one poor Chap who had his face badly shattered made a sign to me for a Cigarette by making a motion of his hand mouth as I had some in my Case I lit one gave it to him he evidently enjoyed it, a few minutes later another poor fellow passed away making 7 deaths in all, the number of wounded killed totalled nearly 40 before we left the Hospital the A.M.C Boys invited us to a Meal as it was nearly 5 am we were all tired
