 June, 1915 Thursday 17 I have seen the 3.4.5 Infantry Brigades go &amp; now the 6th is camped opposite &amp; we wake to their Bands in the morning &amp; all the Arab Hawkers &amp; Small Shops are doing good business again. X Two Letter Cards from May I note she is at home now, I am very glad &ndash; X Ralph Arnold has not been near me since weeks ago I took his photo &amp; he camps only 200 yards away, but perhaps he feels I am an Officer &amp; he a Trooper. Also got a letter from Percy Smith Millawa, bad time on the Murrumbidgee with drought.
