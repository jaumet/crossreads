Revielle at 5.30During morning parade men were given an idea of how entraining & embarkation is to be carried out. I through the day had 4 trips to Cairo for various things mostly motor spares. Freans machine is giving trouble internally & he has had it down completely & found that the connecting rod nut & pin has slightly moved Cox's Doug stills goes as well as ever only the front [indecipherable] is uncertain the Triumph has carburetter trouble still & slight tube (induction) fault. Attached to Gen Spene's staff for the afternoon & came in contact with Gens Maxwell & Dorritt. We are to go on the "Devona" along with HQ staff, horses still to be retained Bed at 10.5.
