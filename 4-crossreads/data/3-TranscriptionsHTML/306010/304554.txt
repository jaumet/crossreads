<p>1916<br/>January 1st  (Sat)<br/>With No. 2 General Hospital, Aust. Army Medical Corps stationed at Gezira, Cairo.<br/>Have been away from Sydney over 13 months<br/>Jan 4th (Tues)<br/>Real Egyptian winter weather now. Bright, sunny days &amp; cold nights. Last night <strike>it</strike> rain came down fairly heavily &ndash; this is the fourth time it is rained since I have been in Cairo, nearly 12 months.<br/>It is very hard to know how to put in one's spare time. I don't particularly care for knocking round Cairo's streets &amp; walks round Gezira become monotonous. A chap does miss having no real friends &amp; I do envy those lucky chaps who have been able to chum up with people of some nationality or other.</p>
