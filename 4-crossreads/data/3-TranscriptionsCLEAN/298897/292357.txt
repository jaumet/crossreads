I was an out & outer when all the time I was merely doing what I was told to do.  But such is the way of the world.  Had a fine trip in the afternoon.  Drugs were required from a neighbouring town & as we were told the 1st Division were in the same place four of us went together with the hope of seeing them.  We took the "Ford' & I drove & had a real good spin the afternoon being finished off in good style by receiving a mail on my return.  Have just received an order that all horses killed or die from causes other than from disease are to be sold to local butchers for human consumption.  By later telegrams I see that St Col Pope has returned to Australia.  He was in charge here at the stunt & owing to some blunder was relieved of his duties reverting to his rank from that of Brigadier General.  Incompetence receives no sanction here.
Tuesday 29th AugustO.S. for the day.  Nothing but the usual duties which were complicated however during the afternoon by heavy rain.  Usual bombardment going on & plenty of rumours of an offensive.
