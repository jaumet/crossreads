<p>I had a week to wait for the 1 board &amp; marked B.2 which meant a trip to England but had a wait of another week. I received orders on the 16.9.18 that I was to proceed on the long looked for journey &amp; left camp at 2PM on that date by motor &amp; was taken to the wharf at Le Havre. We embarked at 7PM on the Monas[t?] Queen &amp; sailed at 11PM &amp; after an all night voyage landed at Southampton at 8.30AM next morning. We then had to march to the Railway station &amp; given three hours leave &amp; it was great to feel the English air once more. We left by train at Midday &amp; detrained at Weymouth where motors awaited us &amp; was taken to Westham camp &amp; fixed up for the night. Next morning I had to go before the doctor &amp; was classified C11 &amp; the same on the next day  &amp; was drafted to No 4 Coy. I was finally boarded</p>
