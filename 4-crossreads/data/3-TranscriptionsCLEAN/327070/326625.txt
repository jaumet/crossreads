  
 Friday 11 February 1916 
 A clear fine day with a very pleasant cool breeze. 
 Parades held as usual, but in the morning, with the orderly's help I did most of the packing. During the day we passed several vessels going in both directions: in the morning a large boat going in the same direction was in sight, & it took us until 6 o'c in the evening to overhaul & pass her. She was quite close & proved to be the French mail steamer "Athos" plying between Marseilles & China. She seemed to be carrying a few troops, probably French reservists. 
 In the evening the prizes donated by the passengers for the various competitions were presented. A sum of 45 was subscribed for prizes by the passengers, in addition to the 30 given for gramophones, games etc early in the voyage. 
 After dinner the Steward's Concert was given on the well deck where the troops & passengers could see, & proved to be simply splendid. It lasted 21/2 hours, there being 6 items before & 6 after the interval, including one or two comedy sketches in addition to songs etc. as a climax a "Foo-Foo Band" of abt 20 members very variously & curiously arrayed & supplied with instruments (?) caused roars of laughter. 
 A collection in aid of the fund for supplying tobacco to our soldiers & sailors was taken up at the interval & realised &pound:30, the major part, of course, coming from the passengers. I don't think the men will ever forget the entertainment. During it there was no motion at all perceptible. A clear starry night again. 
 Ship's run 344 miles.
