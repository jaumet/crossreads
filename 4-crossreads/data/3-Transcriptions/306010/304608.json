The church is a fine big building (Roman Catholic) and very pretty inside &ndash; surmounted by a colossal bronze statue 30ft in height glittering in the sunshine. Came down the hill in the electric lift  (84 m&egrave;tres) which has been constructed for the purpose. Took a tram round to the Corniche and went into the "Bains de Catalans" for a swim. The baths are built on the continental style with a big open front set with tables &amp; chairs for afternoon tea in your dressing gown &ndash; after coming out of the water. Mixed bathing of course.
