<p>March 11, 12<br/>- a book of Rodin and Degas amongst the window's show.  To the Medaillane [Madeleine ?] and to the Louvre, closed!  Dull disappointments everywhere, fine monuments sandbagged, and a mist hiding all long lovely vistas of buildings and statues.</p>
<p>Booked seats for tomorrow's "Hamlet" at the Opera and at the Y.M. seats for "Paris trip No. 1" tomorrow at 11.</p>
<p>At Smiths bought book of Edward Thomas' "The Tenth Muse" and later a book of Poulbot's exquisite drawings of kiddies.</p>
<p>Some part of Paris is getting a fair towelling tonight!  God how futile these raids are.  And so To Bed!</p>
<p>March 12<br/>212.<br/>A splendid sun day, last night slept long &amp; soundly loving the cool kindliness of sheets forgetting "the rough male kiss of blankets".  Now waiting for breakfast.</p>
<p>213.<br/>Back from the Opera, turning in.  A splendid night and a fine show.  The plan of Hamlet cleverly twisted and designed to present a rich and far less terrible 'Hamlet' than Shakespeare's.  Hamlet, responding to the third sudden appearance of his father's ghost in the last act, kills his uncle, and the finish is "Vive la Roi".  Hamlet is king.</p>
<p>A fascinating and gripping play, and magnificently seeing &amp; a wounderful art in the stage lighting.</p>
<p>During the day the Paris No. 1, a good trip and enjoyed tremendously.  We are foreigners in a lovely city:  that is our tragedy, these lovely buildings I cannot grip hardly in my mind, their loveliness overpowers, numbs all appreciation but a dim almost abnormal one.</p>
<p>214.<br/>Booked for Versailles tomorrow, Paris No. 2 on Thursday and the Opera "Faust" on Saturday, "Aida" on Thursday night, must work Frank to a desire for it and if possible Materlinck's "Pelais [Pelleas] et Melisande tomorrow night.  And so again to bed</p>
