<p>22-1-17<br/>Mon 22nd<br/>We have had a cruel time of it today  a heavy wind blowing the sand over us &amp; it is coming up cloudy &amp; very cold; Two deserters came along this morning they say they are practically starving, &amp; we quite believed it by the quantity of bread &amp; meat they consumed for dinner &amp; they looked poor &amp; half fed, I have a touch of a sore throat this afternoon &amp; am taking a night shift on the 'phone as we are still a man short on Head Quarters &amp; the duties come rather hard on four of them; The Sqdns take it night about on Outpost.</p>
