Abberville. That Sergeant is now in charge of B section in place of Sgt Canvin.Vic Hall, Bert Emmott & I have been leading a pleasant life. Hall is exempt from parades, & so is Bert every third week, being on nursing duties with A section, while I attend all parades. - Yet spare time is not meagre.On fine mornings we rise an hour before reveille & get kits and cleaning up done by the time we go on physical drill parade
