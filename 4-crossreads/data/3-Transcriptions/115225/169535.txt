Ammo dump outside Bailleul - Johnno accidently ran over a chow &amp; killed him&nbsp;&amp; they tried for his blood. he drove up to the park &amp; got well hidden as quickly as possible &amp; the chows followed him up, we all turned out with rifles loaded &amp; bayonets fixed &amp; were told to by the officer in command of the Chows if anything started we were to kill the whole lot if necessary &amp; that the lesson would do them good. for our part we were sick of the cows &amp; we were wishing for an openly hostile act as an excuse to get into them but they quietened down after a while &amp;&nbsp;<s>some other</s><sup>&nbsp;we</sup>&nbsp;took them home again - they are a stupid lot of beggars&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
