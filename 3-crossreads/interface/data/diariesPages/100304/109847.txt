had his hip blown away and was in great pain. King had his hand blown off and there was another man horribly injured in the stomach. On pulling down my trousers I found my left leg covered in blood from a wound 3 inches above the knee and fastened on a field dressing. I then got Lance Corpl Smith to drag me out of the way while I supervised operations. The shells continued to blow the trench in on the dead and wounded and other men got to work bandaging up those who were hit. Dyett, Smith and others did splendid work for poor crying shattered fellows . the groans and cries with the constant crash made a hell of the place Earth kept being blown in on the wounds as they dressed them. I sent for Bazeley and ordered all the sentries back on to their posts to watch for any signs of attack and supervised the carrying out of the worst cases on waterproof sheets. I was lying right in the gangway and they could not help treading on my wounded leg as they passed by and I don't remember much
