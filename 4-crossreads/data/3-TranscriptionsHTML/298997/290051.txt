<p>Small gap, March 26 &ndash; April  1st</p>
<p>April 2nd<br/>We left Voormezeele, marched to Ridge Wood &amp; entrained.  The country through which we travelled (in open trucks) looked very beautiful, &amp; peaceful &amp; prosperous: the possibility that war may visit it soon seems awful; yet the reports from the south makes things look very black.  After detraining we marched to a little place called Wippenhoek near Boeschepe.  No-body seems to have any idea about what it is intended to do with us.  but we seem likely to move a lot, and most of us, for that reason left a lot of carefully collected souvenirs at Voormezeele.</p>
<p>April 3rd<br/>Have no work to do, but were concerned for the first time, with some drill, and cleaning our rifles etc.  The Company is joking about our being "Britain's Last Hope".  There is practically no news, but plenty of wild rumours.  Most of us took a walk to Poperinghe, where we could see the damage that had been caused by recent shelling.  The sight of two white children's cots in the ruins of one house made me feel mad. I came across a few of the Platoon of the 1st Battn outside Pop. and asked Wells to help me to get back.</p>
<p>April 6th<br/>We had practical holiday for several days but on this day left our billets at 5.30 am and moved</p>
