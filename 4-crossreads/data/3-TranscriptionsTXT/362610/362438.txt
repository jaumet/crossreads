 Thursday 10 August 1916 Had an early breakfast in order to be ready for a motor-bus which was to take us to a demonstration of an attack a few miles distant : it was pretty late in turning up but as it turned out it did not matter much. The day was dull &amp; there was drizzling rain more or less intermittently. At the demonstration there were many generals, staff officers &amp; others, everything going off well. Had to return by a roundabout route, arriving at Herissat a little after 1 o'clock. We were told that the king was close by &amp; might pass thro' our village, but only the 2nd Bde. had the chance of seeing His Majesty. Billetted in a usual type of cottage &amp; fairly comfortable.
