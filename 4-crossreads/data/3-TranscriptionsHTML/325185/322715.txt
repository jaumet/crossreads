<p>they must have made some big improvements in Liverpool since I left according to Berts letter fancy [indecipherable]  I am afraid it would make us billions. One day we were given a shin of beef for rations as you know there isn't any meat on it so we decided to give it to the Germans to make soup.We have a machine you can fire thing out of so in went the beef but to our disappointment only went half way. I am sure they would have enjoyed it. I had some very good souveniers nose caps from shells but one of the artillery men was leaving one day when it exploded appears there are three detonators in the German shell needless to say he went where they don't keep shells  as soon as we were told you should have seen the scatter for our packs to pull these things out &amp; examined them we know the No of the lively ones</p>
