There were also a coupl of other letter , one from Mrs Barker , and one from Min , also a short note from Harri , he was feel better . In your letter you name two place , where New South men took part in the fight on the 10th 11th of April . we were at the first name H. on Easter Monday morn , we commenc just about four oclock after wait near all night , at the start point , we were up near the last name R. on the fourth and 6th of May it was then that I got hit , the paper will have told you more than I would be abl to , so I will not say more here . Had I known of Lyb approach marriag earlier I would have ask you to get her some littl present for me , also someth for each of the other girl , I would have sent someth from this side , but have not the readi money . I am not short so far as pocket money is concern . 28/ - per fortnight doe me nice but then there are general one or two who want littl loan . and whenev we get a chanc , we buy extra , such as bread . Tin fruit Tomato 's , fruit of other sort , pear appl most . They are rather expens though , so the money soon dwindl , soon thing may be a littl better I hope so . Jim Elder is here in this camp I see him pretti well everi day I hunt him up one day , some time ago , I had been look for Eric , and find that he was over in Blighti I look Jim up . he had a letter from Eric , not long ago which he shew me . E was then at Weymouth , and did not say whether he was like to come across soon . he has never told Jim , whether he was hit bad or not . Ken is a Sergeant , somewher over here . I have never met him yet . I fanci that he has a pretti good job and it doe not take him into much danger but I may be wrong . In your Letter you spoke of Henrietta Low be at Ourimbah , was it L.W. or the Brother who was so ill , I fanci the latter , for I think that someon told me in a letter that F.W. had come over to this side , and had been wound , I may have made a mistak , Thing are veri unsettl with us just at present .
