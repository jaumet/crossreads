<p>Dear Mr. Molesworth,</p>
<p>I have heard so much of you, that I do not in the least feel as tho' I am writing to a stranger.  I am posting you a photo of Arthur, he thought you might like to have it.  'Tis not a very good one, but you know Arthur and will understand how he felt when facing a photographer and tried to smile.</p>
<p>Let's hope he'll return safely tho', and then we shall dispense with the photo.</p>
<p>You know that we were married a short time back, don't you, and being in possession of that fact you are wiser than even our own people.  It's a very serious problem I can tell you, and we think it advisable to keep it secret until Arthur returns; then the world</p>
