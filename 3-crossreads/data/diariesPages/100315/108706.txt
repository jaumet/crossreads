The body of one of his men has been found out in No Mans Land where the Hun raiders must have left him. His throat was cut.

Minnenwerfers were again worrying us last night and we seem to be unable to cope with their demoralizing work owing to our inferior trench artillery. Had a quiet night but very restless. Rats in plenty.
