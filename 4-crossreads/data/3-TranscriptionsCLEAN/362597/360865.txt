  
 Thursday 13.1.16 (22) We had no High Jinks today. The Colonel would not allow it. We had to be content with seeing Neptune confided to the deep with muffled drums & the "Last Post" on the bugles at 7 pm. 
 I have not had any special duty to do for about 3 or 4 days. I suppose I will cop out to-morrow. We had a lecture this afternoon & I could not keep awake. I was sitting right in front & went to sleep twice & Ellis had to wake me up. 
 Had first lesson at Roller-Bandaging last night. I am learning every thing
