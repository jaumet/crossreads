Bailleul was shelled yesterday & 30 or 40 people killed or wounded one of our Planes was hit by a fluke & blown to bits a dispatch Rider was blown to pieces one of his hands was picked up 200 yds away. glad when we get out of this deferred Pay. 45-13-0 Owe 2-10-7. The Boys in the front line heard us getting shelled & wondered how we were getting on. Big smash on this front in a few day's time. 
 Sunday 17/3/18 did not feel too comfortable last night Capt Gow told us to make for dug-outs if fritz started again. Went looking for one & found one that would hold 200 men a beauty, but did not have to use it as fritz gave some other camp a doing on our left. This morning he sent over 4 H.E. on top of Mt Kemmel something doing to day 20 Planes went over just now looked fine. Another lot off to Blighty today & schools. Pay day. deferred Pay 45-14-6 Owe 2-8-7 Wrote Post Cards to N. J. C & A.
