<p>I won't attempt to discuss the opinions of the men &amp; their ideas of rights &amp; wrongs. Only I leave it to the reader to judge for himself. Anyhow by 7 pm everyone was on board &amp; some time during the night the Afric steamed away again.</p>
<p>25/1/16<br/>Mess orderly again with Hooper &amp; more trouble over washing up. Knife polish off so have to use a brick. Sugar now procurable at 6d a lb &amp; tinned fruit gone up to 1/4 a tin, tinned salmon up to 1/- a tin. Sardines up to 6d a tin something cruel as there are only 9 sardines to a tin. Scotty afraid of submarines &amp; torpedoes. He spends most of his time waiting for death. I believe &amp; eagerly discusses the possibility of trouble &amp; the cause of anything strange. Our course now due N.W. making us dubious as to our destination &ndash; a persistent rumour going round that we are heading for Persian Gulf &amp; thence by shallow draught steamers to Messopotamia, This rumour began in Colombo &amp; seems possible although hardly probable.</p>
