<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,</p>
<p>I've about a dozen letters from you all unanswered.  I have been trying to write since Saturday &amp; now Tuesday has come round &amp; I'm still going to write.  I played Hockey this afternoon &amp; after a Bath, shave &amp; general clean up for the morning it has gone 8 p.m.</p>
<p>I am only just writing to let you know that we are all well.  I will answer your letters later on.  I am enclosing a couple of P.C's that I wish you to put with my others as souvenirs of the great war.  One is from Billy Ali &amp; one from a little Girl at the shop who sends me parcels &amp; letters very regularly.  I have not met Her.  I am very careful how I write so do not be concerned about it.  30.1.18</p>
<p>Well, Here's another night nearly gone &amp; I'm on Duty all alone as the Sergeants are holding a Dance in a Hall near bye.  It is nearly 9 p.m. now &amp; I've to stay on until</p>
