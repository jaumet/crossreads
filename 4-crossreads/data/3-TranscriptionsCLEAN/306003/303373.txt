 The Turkish outpost opened fire on them at about 700 yards & it was a long range fight;  The aeroplane dropped a bomb on a Turkish machine gun & put it out of action, & the New Zealanders had an easy job as only about 20 Turks were left in camp & the remainder (about 200) made good their escape;  The Turkish casualties in camp were 18 killed  3 wounded & 3 taken
