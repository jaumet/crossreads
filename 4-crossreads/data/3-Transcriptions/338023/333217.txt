<p>[Letter written on paper with Church of England Soldiers' Institute letterhead]<br/>17th October 1916</p>
<p>Dearest Mother</p>
<p>Your card turned up alright to-day but, so far, no parcel. Of course the old address c/o Church of E. Institute, is good until we actually leave here, so I hope it will turn up before Thursday. We're going this time &ndash; dinkum! The camp is cheerful &ndash; sincerely &ndash; at last ------- and working hard, I don't think! I'll keep the  English addresses handy &ndash; and as for the other contents of your note, well, Mother, I guess I understand. There was quite a lot I had to my mind to say, but sometimes such things are so hard to put in words that they spoil in the saying &ndash; I  think you'll understand that too. You must not worry any more than you can help, mother mine, for I'm like that sham 'Nero' coin of mine &ndash; always turning up where least expected &amp; terribly hard to lose. My address from Friday (the 20th) is No. 379 Pte H.W.Pryce<br/>4th Reinforcements<br/>9th Machine Gun Company<br/>A.I.F.<br/>-Abroad-<br/>Soon as we get fixed up &amp; under way, I'll write you all about it. In the meantime for a day or so there wont be much to write home about. With love to all  from Harry.</p>
<p>Photos on the way very rough, but a likeness, these days. The enclosure is one of the Boys "Dan" Prisley &ndash; he's a fine chap all round &amp; very popular.</p>
