<p>Friday July 13th<br/>Plenty of work today. There were a good few drunk here last night, of course it is a usual thing pay day, another thing, all the [indecipherable] go round raffling different things on that day.</p>
<p>Saturday July 14th<br/>The chap who has been working with me, was taken off today, so I have double work to do now, that is outside, but another fellow was put on the clerical job, so I have only outside work to do now, there isn't very much to do, &amp; if there happens to be any heavy work a fatigue party is always drawn of the parade. Received fourteen letters from Australia.</p>
<p>Sunday July 15th<br/>Very peculiar day, Sunshine &amp; raining, a couple of very heavy showers too, it seems to have cleared away this evening though. Answering letters nearly all day, all fairly long ones too. All the lads here made a riot this evening about 8 p.m. &amp; it last well into midnight. None of the old hands were in it. The trouble was caused through gambling. Two of them had a fight &amp; the Military Police interferred, one lad was taken to the "clink", &amp; the mob would not let the other be taken, so the M.P. &amp; Warrant Officer tried force, result Corporal M.P. broken jaw in two places. W.O. skin knocked off his face &amp; black eye.</p>
