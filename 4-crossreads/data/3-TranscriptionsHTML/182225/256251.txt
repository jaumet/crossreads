<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; SATURDAY 13&nbsp;&nbsp; MAY</p>
<p>Cold and showery all day&nbsp; Our battery was on duty but they took the left Section for guard ect. I was mess orderly, and was also grabbed for fatigue &mdash; carrying flour Spuds, dry rations ect &mdash; from fore hold to saloon gally. We called in at Port Phillip about mid-day to pick up two ship&#39;s quartermasters who had deserted also to drop our mails. A [?] torpedo destroyer took the mails. We ran into dirty weather in evening off Cape Otway, cold and rain and westerly gales.</p>
