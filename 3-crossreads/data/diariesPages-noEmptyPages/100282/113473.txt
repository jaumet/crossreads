We slept at Rossignol Camp early this morning we were taken away to our present billets quite close to Meteren Bailleul, the whole Coy. is billeted in a large barn I think we will be comfortable when we get settled down, there was another mess up with the motors coming down the road was badly choked with traffic especially coming through Bailleul, for the streets are so narrow.
It is frightfully cold today a thick heavy mist hangs over all the land there is no sign of the sun
Will have all my clothes off tonight the first time for 32 nights, so you can guess what kind of a relief it will be for me.
2nd. Started parades again this morning it was very very cold, we did not do much only tried a new way of falling your platoon in, some style show I can tell you, you would have split your sides laughing if you could
