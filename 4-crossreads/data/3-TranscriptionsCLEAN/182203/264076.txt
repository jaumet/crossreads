  
 I arrived here just as some of my pals were going for a tram ride to Uxbridge, a place I have not been to, so I went with them. We had a delightful ride, through very pretty country, with crops partly gathered in, orchards, & vegetable gardens - quaint way-side Inns etc. When we returned to Southall about 9. p.m. found out a Cafe, so we all had hot coffee & ham sandwiches for 4 1/2 d each. We had great fun - people wondering what we were - Someone asked If we were the new "Aust. Lady Members of Parliament - What think you? Then If we were the new "Lady Policemen"? so goodness knows what we looked like. We have to wear our regulation uniform & now  have Stars & straps on our shoulders - It is very funny, we get the Salute now from the men, we can only bow, - but we get a lot of fun out of life.
