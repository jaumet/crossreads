<p>The army has lost a great soldier in Holmes. He had, I think, only two faults. One was that he consistently neglected his first duty of looking after himself. This is a fault one often sees with senior officers, &amp; junior ones too for that matter, and one which I think is a very [indecipherable] one. <strike>The other fault </strike> None will question his great ability as a soldier especially as a fighting man, I personally had a very <strike> high opi</strike> high opinion of him.<br/>I shall write you of my opinion of the course here as soon as things settle down a bit.<br/>Best Love to Mrs Ferguson and Dorothy<br/>Affectionatly Yours<br/>CR Lucas</p>
