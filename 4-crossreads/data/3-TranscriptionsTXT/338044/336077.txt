 [Private and later Sergeant Percy Joseph Hurley enlisted in the A.M.C. and embarked from Sydney on the "Argyllshire" on 30 September 1915. Up to page 210 this diary records his story. From page 210 to page 215 it records the experiences of Private George Arnold Moxham who left Sydney on the same ship as Hurley, as a member of the 19th  Battalion, 4th Reinforcement. George Moxham's diary, which reads backwards from page 215 to page 210, covers 10 July 2016 to 15 July 2016 when he was on board ship going from Alexandria to Marseille. Percy Hurley was on the same ship and they shared this book to record their experiences of that voyage. Percy Hurley never saw service at the front and was invalided back to Australia on 23 March 1917. ]
