They are still talking about that mail but it has not come yet so I'll finish this off not wait for it. I have never received that Pastoral Review with all your photos in it (the March one I think it was) - in future i think when you post it you had better put a cover round it - a church paper or a Mudgee Guardian, as two or three chaps have also not got magazines sent to them and it may be that there is somebody in the base who is hard up for something to read. We are still camped along side the good stream of water and there is absolutely nothing doing, which is quite sufficient in this warm climate to make a person have that tired feeling most of his time. our time down here in the valley is nearly up now. I expect we will soon be going up for another change of mountain air. I hope it is not so cold up there this time as it was last. No news so I'll stop. Love to Father abd Fred & yourself Mother.
