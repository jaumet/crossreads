<p>London<br/>20.5.16.<br/>The last week I have spent totally away from all things savouring of war.  Seeing the sights of London, the theatres and resteraunts and generally rushing about and this we call our rest.  I think I shall feel more tired when I get back to France than I have felt for ages and ages.  A few days ago I went up into Suffolk to see my brother and the country looked lovely, rushing through Norfolk at about 30 miles an hour on the Great Eastern certainly gives one a great impression of the beauty of England.  I rushed out to Lowestoft and Yarmouth and saw a little of the damage done by the German raiders.<br/>The impressions one gets in London at night while it is now clothed</p>
