cap of a shell, any how it is hard to say what was the real cause only it was a very regrettable incident very sad, I trust that it will not be my lot to witness such a scene. As there were not much to do I finished at 4 Pm. 
Friday 11/1/18 Saturday 12/1/18 was also quiet, with the exception that I was relieved at 2 Pm (14 oclock) at the same time the Paymaster arrived paid all hands. I walked back to camp cleaned myself dressed had some Tea when another chum myself caught a Troop Train went into Poperinghe later on to St Omer for 2 days leave. As it was my long shift off I intended to have another good time away. On arriving in Town at 5 Pm Saturday we both went along to the Tivoli Theatre reserved a seat at 5-30 we both went in got a comfortable seat at 6 pm the Variety show started to a packed house. It was a very poor show badly managed after a while the boys started to go out. Anyhow as we both had plenty of time we stayed till the finish, the Singing Acting was very poor not worth mentioning.  It was over at 8 Pm we just managed to get a drink in an Estaminet nearby then we both went along to the Y.M.C.A. opposite the station to put in time until the Train left after Midnight
