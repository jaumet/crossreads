  
 afternoon the other fellow and I rode in on the Ladies cycles to Beccles and hired a boat and had an enjoyable hour or so on the Waveney River which runs along the valley at the bottom here.  The fields and along roads are very beautiful just now.  Buttercups  along  in the  roads  fields and May in its different colours along roads and hedges.  Abundance of bird life.  Gardens and fields seem to be conscious suddenly of the glory and sweetness of life.  Youth and energy are written all over the country surface. 
 6th Went boating  today  on the Waveney River this morning and slept nearly all the afternoon.
