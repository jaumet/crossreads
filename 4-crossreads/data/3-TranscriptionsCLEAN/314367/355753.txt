I'm just putting on record a fact - The Ward room has 7 Officers - Add to that Fritz = 8 - In 6 days the Beer (Resch's lager) drunk & to be paid for is 157 Bottles i.e. - 3 Cases & 13 Bottles - Of course there were guests - thirsty ones - Also of course Beer was not the only drink - Gin & Bitters - G & Vermouth - Lemon Squash & whisky - Brandy (rarely touched) - Soda water made by ourselves - Truly its marvelous - my own notion is - that - though the Officers pay - yet others drink as well - who don't pay - Nevermind - Cheer-O - The Country is in a state of war - A favourite drink is the one that Captain Cook had - when he first landed - "a little gin" - Vermouth & Gin are known as 'Virgins' - & asked for as such -
Monday Feb 8-15 - No word of our moving on - I put in the morning over the Mess accounts - fixing things up - Going ashore & squaring bills - The difficulty is German money - We want English - It seems that the Chinese like English gold & hoard all they can get & it goes out of circulation - I have refused to be paid save in English currency or cheques on Sydney - I had Lieutenant Creswell to dinner - He wanted to get hold of our gramophone records but we would not sell records only -
