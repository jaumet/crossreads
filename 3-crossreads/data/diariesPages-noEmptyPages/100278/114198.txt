account of his sore heel which is septic.
I believe, got it from marching in bad boots.
Have been issued with large quantities of immature cheese lately, which is a great waste for no one scarcely eats it and it is thrown away, you can't beat the army for waste and yet in some things they are terribly closefisted
10th Fatigue again this morning carting bricks and stone and we also had to dig a drain through some muddy ground. What do you think, well this afternoon I had to take all the men up I could find and go and chuck all the mud which we carted on to the horse lines the other day away on to one side. I knew very well when we put it there it was useless, you should hsve seen it over a foot deep and it would bog a duck. They have been issuing fair sized lots of rum lately don't the boys like it.
