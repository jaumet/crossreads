Tuesday 13 August 1917 [1918]A day to be remembered! soft colors of the Pyramids & above all a quiet friend to enjoy it all with.  Capt. Bigg called at the "Bierts [?] Retreat", 4.15 p.m. motored Groppi's, there we talked to Lt. Goss, Lt. Jarrett, Lt. McLean, Lt. Sullivan, nice boys all, then away to the Pyramids & if I could only describe the soft blue light in the distance, green fields, & yellow sand, above all Capt. Bigg telling me in his quiet voice of Gallipoli days.  First casualty he saw was a man, both legs, 1 arm blown off, then carried a dead one out, after that nothing hurt so much ever again.  In that awful valley full of death one could hardly build a "dugout" without coming upon the body of some brave man fallen.  At Suvla bay 500 men (wounded) burnt, scrub caught fire.
