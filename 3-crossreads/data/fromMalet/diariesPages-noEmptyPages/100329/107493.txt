This morning I am struck by the extreme calm & beauty of the blue Meditteranean & how peaceful a scene it must be to the roaring torment of war which is being raged not many miles ahead. Today we are at rest on the calm bosom of a summers sea – tomorrow, aye, tomorrow, perhaps the dread torpedo will send us to the bottom unwarned & to die like rats in a trap. For we are in the extreme danger zone now of the enemy’s submarines. Only 25 miles ahead one day August 13 last week a troop ship Royal Edward (?) containing drafts & reinforcements for the Med. Imp. force was sunk sent to a watery grave & only 25% of the brave fellows aboard were saved. And so we sail along taking the same risk. A great risk but how great is the spirit of our troops. Happy & debonair they sing like so many larks on a bright April morn & their hearts are big & strong. They have resigned themselves to the inevitable.

We passed the Grecian Archipellago during the day – Tinos, Denos & Sirra (?). These towns nestle in the side of steep dun brown hills or along the sea shore & are quite bizarre & picturesque.

A beautiful sunset – here we saw "the roseate hues of the sun-burnt west" in all its magnificent glory.

Attended Holy Communion – Arthur Gray present.

Arrived at Lemnos at daylight. A hive of shipping – warships, troopships, & merchantmen. Hospital Ships also frequent – I notice one of the latter named the "Dunluce Castle". Served with 200 rounds of ammunition each. Sent a P.C. to Mabel "Expect to be in action tomorrow".

Notice HMAS "Sydney" in harbour. Served with two days rations.
