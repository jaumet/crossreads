<p>made our way to a Restaurant &amp; had a great feed &ndash; we were starving &ndash; this climate makes us eat &amp; the food is so good. I shall get very fat if I stay here much longer. Everybody thinks I'm looking well &amp; getting my color again. <br/>Returned to Southall through Kew had a huge circle trip &ndash; got in about 9. 30. p.m. feeling very tired &amp; got to bed as soon as possible. This morning have to wait for news, so cannot go out until this afternoon, hence this long letter. Must get into the <u>Base</u> to get my pay-book fixed-up &amp; procure a little more money. My money is flying here, hope to be able to save in France.<br/>I would give something to know how my beloved is &amp; where. Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all &amp; hope you are well. From,                                                                                                Yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                        Edith.</p>
