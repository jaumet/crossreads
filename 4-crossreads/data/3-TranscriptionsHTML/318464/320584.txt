<p><strike>ready for</strike> the main body, <strike>who came the</strike> which arrived next day (Aug./16/15.  I was disappointed at not being able to get a few hours leave to ramble about this ancient city of historic fame, and I must say that it has a fine harbor.  The day following the arrival of the main body found us outward bound;  <strike>and</strike> coo-eeing and waving farewells to the troops on <strike>the</strike> other transports, also to the wounded on <strike>the</strike> hospital ships.</p>
<p>I had a pleasant trip across the Mediterranean Sea, and was amazed at the intensity of the blue water.  A sharp lookout was kept for submarines, which had torpedoed the transport "Royal Edward", three days before, with the loss of 750 men and officers.  The "Saturnia" was carrying twice her proper complement, so we slept on the decks;  in lifeboats, rafts, etc;  <strike>and</strike> always <strike>had</strike> wearing the lifebelts, <strike>on</strike> and we were lucky to get fine weather.  I remember <strike>see</strike> seeing a rude doggerel written on a boat chock, as follows</p>
<p>"God and the soldier we all adore"<br/>When trouble is here, and no more<br/>When the war is o'er, and wrongs are righted<br/>God is forgotten;  the soldier slighted.</p>
<p>Written by a cynic, I suppose, still, I wonder?</p>
