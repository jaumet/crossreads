Just pass me a pint of stout and mild
And I'll tell my tale of woe
Now I was there at Warwick Square
With others of my breed
When Andy Fisher inspected us along with Georgie Reid
He said we were a noble band
To our ountry we did credit
When someone yelled "Not 'arf they don't
They're the country's bloomin' Debit?
Over the top in a desperate
