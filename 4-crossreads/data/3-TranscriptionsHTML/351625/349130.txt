<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>I will try &amp; write a few lines before this place closes tonight.  An Australian mail arrived today &amp; I got 3 letters, one nice big one from you, No. one from Aunt Cissie &amp; one from Rene &amp; Joan, but yours are always the best.  I met Arthur this week &amp; spent a couple of evenings with him and am going with him tomorrow Sunday afternoon for a walk over to Stone Henge.  I posted you a booklet to day with views of Salisbury &amp; neighbourhood with a good picture of Stonehenge in it.  The town of Salisbury is about 10 miles from here &amp; we have to get a special pass to go there but we will pay it a trip when we get out of isolation.  Our latest stunt here is trench digging which is jolly hard work</p>
