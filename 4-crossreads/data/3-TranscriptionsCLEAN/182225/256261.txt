 1916   TUESDAY 23   MAY 
 Still blowing & a bit cold, but there was some sun during the day. I was allowed up for a few hours & was out on the deck in the sun. It was great to be out in the fresh air again, although I was very weak. There was a concert in the evening & it was a fair success I believe. 
   
 The gulf dividing Saint and sinner is neither wide enough nor deep enough to make a song about.
