<p>Through all this bad weather the "charges" have been put off, &amp; they may not take place now till next Spring, yesterday morning the Germans attempted to take a position off us they got half way across &amp; then they got stuck in the mud, &amp; the boys killed everyone of them, so that ought to be a lesson to us.  Big mail in tonight I got 2 parcels out of it one from Aunt Carrie &amp; one from Miss Duke  they both came at a very opportune time the socks &amp; knee pads especially will be handy  Tonight I get my third promotion I am a Sergeant tonight, pretty rapid you know.  We have just had a rifle inspection the first one for some time<br/>28th. Was flooded completely out last night by a heavy rain storm just as darkness was setting in, "what Bon," so some of the boys made room for me crowded as they were in their miserable dugout, &amp; lit a fire</p>
