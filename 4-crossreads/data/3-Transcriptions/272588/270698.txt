<p>Monday 29 April<br/>We went up to the next post this evening for rations &amp; found the place simply pock marked with new shell holes, &amp; one direct on the farm house, causing two casualties to our chaps, poor "Comme ca" Clifford killed &amp; Crocker wounded.<br/>We have had no carries for the last 24 hours. Suckow too was wounded in Strazeele losing his arm.</p>
<p>Tuesday 30 April<br/>Early this morning Fritz obtained another direct hit on our house but everyone was in bed &amp; no one hurt. Otherwise everything has been quiet to-day. We were relieved to-night &amp; reported to Caestre, where we were received by a hail of 5.9's from Fritz.  Move on again to H.Q. outside Hazebrouck.</p>
