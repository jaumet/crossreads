12/7/17 Beaulencourt
Another field day. Went to BdeHQ. At 9 am. Decked in a cap and white arm bands and met Colonel Watson and others and acted as an umpire at the tactical exercise which was fairly well done. The men are getting a bit stale on this field work unfortunately and could do with a change of syllabus. An exquisite sunny day with a cool wind. Dooley took charge of the Battalion for the purpose of the stunt. After the operation the inevitable powwow was held. Being a war in afternoon everyone had a sleep after lunch. Rohn's lecture at Mess on sniping was quite good and started a series of questions a discussion on different points. Put in the evening doing a little French and writing letters including one to marraine who is proving false. The snows of the Swiss Alps cool the Parisienne heart.
