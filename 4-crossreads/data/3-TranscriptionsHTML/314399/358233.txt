<p>Sunday 24 August 1919<br/>Stomach upset. Will have to take some Gregory's. It doesn't take much to put a color on my tongue these days. Think I want a lot of football. Read today &amp; did a bit of printing. All my photos of Cape Town turned out well.<br/>Feel upside down tonight. Just can't be bothered doing anything.</p>
<p>Monday 25 August 1919<br/>See the coast all day. Saw a few farms. Very little of the ground tho was cultivated. The majority of it looked very bare with trees &amp; shrubs here &amp; there &amp; plenty of rocks. Nice big breeze. Read all day. Played a few hands of rummy &amp; sevens after dinner.</p>
