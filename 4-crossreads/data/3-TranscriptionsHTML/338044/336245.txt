<p>of Bonsecours &amp; to-morrow evg. Legge &amp; I intend going there, during the stillness to verify.</p>
<p>17th August:- Thursday<br/>More work to-day &amp; it is really too - much for any person to do. Kept going all the casualty lists all days, the numbers of wounded coming in for 2nd Division is astounding  Dinner at our new place &amp; it is really nice &amp; tasty. Who likes French cooking may have it. I've had enough  Work until 9 pm &amp; then take a tram ride to the hill of Bon Secours for some fresh air. The town in the valley all lighted looks well from here. Arrive home 10 pm</p>
<p>18th August:- Friday<br/>Plenty of work again to-day &amp; it's a case of just put head down &amp; go for it hard &amp; strong all day long. The casualties enormous. Put through 411 for 2nd Division to-day  Pay-day &amp; we got 150 francs each</p>
