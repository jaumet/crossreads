<p>If the a/c in the Daily Mirror of the recent <u>Quatia</u> fight here is a sample of information given to the Public, I wonder what the true position is at Verdun? Because it is most misleading<br/> Aeroplanes fly every morning over our Camp so low they frighten the Horses-   A message is dropped &amp; then away they fly again.<br/>It must be hard to discern everything from above &amp; the day of the Light Horseman is not yet over as a scout.<br/>The Star of Bethlehem shines very brightly at night, but I wish MOSES had made his Water Improvements a little more permanent.  The nights are cool &amp; beautifully starlit, but midday hot, <strike>&amp; sweaty</strike> we get a cool breeze from the Mediteranean</p>
