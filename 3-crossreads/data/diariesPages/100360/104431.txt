Mon. Sept. 17. Left Racquingham. Last night we slept in the Orderly Room. Stan Wright & a few more of us. We turned out at 6, & got ready for the Road. Left Racq. about 9 & marched about a mile along the Road till we joined up the Rest of our Brigade. It was quite a warm day & the Juice ran pretty freely. We tried a new idea on this march, forming ourselves into Gun Teams. Instead of carrying our Gear on our Backs, we loaded it on Spiders & hauled it along. "Shag" Miles, Woodsy, were among my Team & they were real good Haulers. On the Road, Miles & I dropped out to find the "correct Time". Before we started on the march I dashed down to the Photogrs & got the remainder of the Photos. Arrived Steenvoord about 6 p.m.

Tues. Sept. 18. Last night I slept next to Billgy May, on the cold hard floor of the Barn. Luckily there was plenty of straw. We left the Farm, where we billeted immediately after Break. & marched through Poperinghe where our Nursing Section have taken over the D.R.S. The Bearers were soon set to work, sorting out poles & Tents & pitching them.
