  
 Stunt as described before. It is about 1/2 mile from the jump off to the objective & it has to be done in rushes of 30 to 100 yds. One is in full Battle order with 120 rounds ammunition & 2 Bombs I was clean done by the time I reached the last trench & could not have put up much of a fight it it had been a dinkum go Kit inspection in afternoon 
 Tuesday 23rd As it was raining hevily when we fell in this morning the Colonel sent us straight to our Huts instead of going about 1 mile to throw live Bombs as we should have done. Did nothing all day & fell in at Y.M & moved off about 8 for Warminster it is a good 5 mile march by the road we took The YM gave us a drink of tea & biscuits about 1/2 way. The people waved & cheered as if soldiers were something fresh & a Draft goes along this road every week & has done so for years. But it is allways the same anywhere I have marched evidently there is something about soldiers to interest people
