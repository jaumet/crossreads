<p>Thursday 3rd May 1917<br/>Bapaume<br/>No Duty<br/>Reveille 3.30 am Donks fed and two or three teams went out about 5am.<br/>About this part of France, which the enemy has been forced to abandon, there is no beauty left and no homesteads or farms but only black ruins and devastation everywhere.<br/>The enemy is adopting the full cruelty of wars malignancy. He has poisoned the wells in his wake, so that if our soldiers horses should drink there they will die. Roads have been mined, opening up enormous craters to retard our transport on the road.<br/>The Taube must have been looking for our Rly. Line and Ammunition dump but he had no luck. While running out of camp 2 or 3 boys fell into barbed wire</p>
