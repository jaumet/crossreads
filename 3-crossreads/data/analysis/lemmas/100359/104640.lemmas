The sledg are work well , but cannot be use at night as they cannot pick their way through the shell hole . We left McCormick about midday and went to Goos Alley . This was a German stronghold and the number of dead men and hors still lie about , testifi to the fierc of the fight . There are plenti of dug-out about which Fritz built .
