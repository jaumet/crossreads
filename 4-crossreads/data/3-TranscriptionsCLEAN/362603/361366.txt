I do not remember whether I told you that I had a Pyjama Suit, a Towel   &   another flannel shirt given to me by the Red Cross about 3 weeks ago.  I have now 2 khaki shirts, 1 silk   &   4 flannel,   &   one light flannel cricketing shirt.Well My Dear ones, news is run out   &   am getting tired as it is about 2 a.m.  My Regards to all enquiring Friends   &   Heaps of Love to you, Dad, Mother   &   George.We are both well   &   getting on quite happily we feel certain that the war is getting on towards the finish.Now Love to you allFrom Harry
