<p>where the linemen &amp; operators were sent.</p>
<p>Wednesday Aug. 2nd<br/>Left camp about 8 am &amp; after the usual waits caught train and detrained at Southall. We then set out for Haynes Park a march of about 4&frac12; miles We marched at a good pace &amp; passed a wood part of which had been blown down by a gale last April. We were marched up to the officers quarters which was the residence of the Duke of Bedford prior to his becoming Duke. We had dinner &amp; then frittered the rest of the day away as well as we could.</p>
<p>Thursday 3rd<br/>Up at 5 a.m. <strike>and marched round to stable</strike> but after a little bit of drill were dismissed again. We were paraded after breakfast before the Lieut. Col. and he gave us a talk on this camp. We were then put through tests of riding &amp; all of us except 6 passed. This surprised the Tommies very much as we were supposed to do 3 weeks course before passing the test. The drivers passed their test in the afternoon while the others painted our tents as a preventitive against Zeps.</p>
<p>The Tommies get treated very badly here. The instructors &amp; officers treat them like dogs but we get treated great. I was talking with one instructor when I should be grooming a horse &amp; all of a sudden he starts roaring at some poor Tommy down the line. The language &amp; the actions of the instructors [indecipherable] is the limit</p>
