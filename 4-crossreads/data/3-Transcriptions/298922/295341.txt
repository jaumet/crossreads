<p>Monday, 15 January 1917</p>
<p>Turned out last night to chase some enemy Cavalry but did not do any good.</p>
<p>Padre previous night roused me saying enemy were coming over the hill he was very excited &amp; made me run out. I saw only <u>BUSHES</u>!!! he had been saying his Rosary away by himself &amp; fancied he saw things.</p>
<p>We now have Tents &amp; I share one with R.C. Padre. You will have my letters acknowledging PARCELS long ere this &amp; I am writing with your pen.</p>
<p>I was amused to see among some gifts from the Victorian Racing Club some bottles of Blue Ointment. <strike>All my love.</strike></p>
