 1917 MARCH 
 9 FRIDAY 
 Fine & Sunny in the morning 
 but snowing & blowing 
 very cold in the evening. 
 Cleaning up round the stables 
 in morning & exercising horses 
 in afternoon. There was a Hun 
 plane over us this morning at 
 only about 500 or 600 ft & they 
 could not get him. Got long 
 letters from Linda, Marj, Jo, 
 Eileen & Mother. Sorry to hear 
 from mother that Aunty 
 Florence had died.
