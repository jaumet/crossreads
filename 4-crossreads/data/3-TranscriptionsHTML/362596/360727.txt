<p>before we get back and then it all depends on how the square heads aim at us, but we all have got dry feet as yet but if a man can only live for 3 months he will see more in that time than one would see here in a lifetime and in my idea it will take a lot of men to put them down as last month the allies lost 23,000 men and only drove them back 2 miles so that is dear travelling.<br/>I will try and get you some P.C of the camp as it is very interesting for you but we take no notice now as we are used to it. I have seen R.Poutter and Billy Jackson they are in the 17th Battalion and seem to like the drill very well but it has been so wet of late that we don't get much time in. I have been trying to get some clothes dry that I washed a week ago, last week it rained 7 inches on Tuesday night up till Wednesday dinner time and it drowned us out and the tents fell down. I never seen so much water before there were 5000 men had to go into the City on Wednesday</p>
