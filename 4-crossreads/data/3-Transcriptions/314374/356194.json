<p>(10)<br/>voluntarily for the soldiers at the War Chest Club.</p>
<p>We saw through St Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, The Tower of London, Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, &amp;c &amp;c.  Spent Good Friday and Easter Saturday and Sunday in London and returned to camp on Easter Monday after a very enjoyable four days.</p>
<p>Mid Summer was now on us and the beauty of an English summer was not to be forgotten.  The beautiful trees, shrubs, flowers and birds were a revelation.  It was light at three in the morning and at ten at night the sun was still up.</p>
<p>I had a touch of pleurisy here and was in hospital ten days, but my brother Charlie was very ill with pneumonia in Fargo Hospital for seven weeks.  Concert parties used to come down from London nearly every night and we had some very interesting lectures given us by some of the leading University men (who were too old for active service).</p>
<p>Five months were spent at this camp and by the end of this time we were all fit and well trained soldiers.  I myself weighed 12 stone.  On 17th April we marched to Bulford and were reviewed by King George V, - a memorable occasion.</p>
<p>On 23rd June the majority of our reinforcements (also 41st reinforcements in which was my brother) left for France.  Myself and two others were kept back in England till 23rd July as we were required as witnesses on a case where a soldier was knocked down by a motor car and badly hurt.</p>
<p>Departure from England for France.</p>
<p>Great excitement prevailed amongst us when we were told to get ready for France.  A couple of days was spent in getting ready and on Monday morning 23rd July 1917 (to the cheers of the men in camp and the strains of the bands playing) we left Larkhill camp England and marched four miles to Amesbury.  We then took train and journeyed to Southampton and embarked on "La Mauguerite" [La Marguerite].  It was a fine sight to see all the transports leaving, being escorted by destroyers and seaplanes.  After a calm trip of nine hours we arrived at Le Harvre and set foot on French soil at daylight on 24th July.  We were in France at last!  The usual street peddlars besieged us selling us chocolates, fruit, and books (how to speak French &amp;c).  We then marched 7 kilos to the Australian Base Camp at Harfleur.  This was a huge camp with every comfort and all were happy here as we were a safe distance from the line &ndash; couldn't even hear the guns or bombardments.  We were fixed up in Bell tents (eight in each) and the meals (served in large dining halls) were excellent.  We stayed here a fortnight practising battle and trench warfare and going through rifle and gas drill.  I was for three days guard at the German prisoners camp.  Also went in one night (in by tram and back by train) with my pal and had a look over the fine city of Le Harvre.</p>
<p>Our way to the parade ground ("Bull ring" as it was called by us) was up a steep hill through a beautiful avenue of trees.</p>
<p>When everything was ready, we marched with full packs up (we were now carrying blankets, gas helmets, ammunition &amp;c) to the railway station</p>
