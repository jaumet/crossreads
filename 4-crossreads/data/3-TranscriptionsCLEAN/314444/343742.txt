 Dear Mrs. Hill, 
 It is my sad duty to inform you of the death of your son, Sergt. Hill, 874, 19th Batt. 2nd Aust. Div. on Saturday Sept. 22nd at 2.10 p.m. I had worship with him a short time before he died and he asked me to write to you giving his love. He was seriously wounded but everything possible was done for his comfort and recovery. The end was very peaceful - he will be buried in the Lejssenhoek Cemetery, Belgium. You have my deep sympathy and I pray that God may comfort you in your hour of sorrow. 
 Yours sincerely A. H. Devon (Capt. Chap).
