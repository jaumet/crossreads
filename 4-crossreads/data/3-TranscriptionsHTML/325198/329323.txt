<p>26 June, 1916<br/>Etmaler<br/>We had to go on out post last night  Took our horses out &amp; it seemed a farce as we had to walk as far as we rode - after we dismounted some of the boys were going crook a treat as its pretty heavey walking in the sand with ones gear up.  The horses were linked up as a picquet of six was left in charge of them.  I took a post with three others &amp; did  two hours shift with them.  we had to stand to at 3.30.  The Brid. came round in the morning.  Bill Walford had to make a mull of chanenging as he did not ask for the Pass word but the old Brid did not say any thing.  After Breakfast I rode over to the canteen at Rail Head to get some stuff for our tent but could get nothing except tinned fish &amp; some Beans.  Draper &amp; I rode across to the Y.M.C.A. thinking we might get a drink there.  but they were all laid out with over work there, the Doctor was there to see them when we were there.  Met Tommy Ducker &amp; he took us down to where we could get a drink of water &amp; he made us a drink of coaco it went well.  I have a night off to night &amp; came over to the Y.M.C.A. at the seventh.  The boys are buying cigarettes &amp; things for all they are worth.  They have a Phonograph hammering away like a circus band at a country show</p>
