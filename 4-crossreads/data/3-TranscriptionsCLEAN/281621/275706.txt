  
 Sunday 8 Return to London & visit Mrs Caper  Clapham Common 
 Monday 9 Off to Birmingham tonight & stay for the night at the Grand Hotel. Birmingham is a very busy place, but is made up of nearly all industrial houses. Some of the suburbs are very nice 
 Tuesday 10 Walk round the Black Country which in the vastness of its works is a revelation to me. See Lea-Brook Wednesbury Bilston Smithwick & have indeed an interesting time.  "Catch of the Season" at the theatre. 
 Wednesday 11 Back in London. Stay at Strand Palace Hotel. 
 Thursday 12 At the Opera this evening. Tristram & Islode at Drury Lane which is gorgeous. Go to camp at Perham Downs tomorrow. Tea with Mrs Capes, Clapham Com. 
 Friday 13 In camp at Perham Downs. It is pretty rotten being back in camp after having the last two months in luxury comparatively. However things are not too bad & the food is eatable.
