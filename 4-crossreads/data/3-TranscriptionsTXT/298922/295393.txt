 Thursday 8 March 1917 
 Letter from Mother &amp; Joe 14/1/17, also letter from Mrs. Stronge [indecipherable] to say J.A.C. was dead. 
 Note all the news, glad all's well. 
 Last night met old Marine Capt. PEARSE of Pastoralists Review at TURF CLUB, Cairo , he returns to Australia in a week or so, he may mention meeting me in his Paper. 
 Today I passed the Turksprisoners, in site of our old Aerodrome Camp Heliopolis &ndash; they are well clothed &amp; fat &amp; photos &amp; Cinemas are sent for propaganda work back to Constantinople &amp; to Syria.
