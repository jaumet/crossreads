[July 1915]
11 Left Bivouac at midnight to go road marking out on the left returned at 4 this morning 14th Battn relieving us. Things getting joyful on Walkers Ridge again, Bombs freely used by the enemy but with small success. Kilid-Bahr again Bombarded by Warships this afternoon. Things getting quite lively across the whole front towards dusk, looks as though there will be something doing. They appear to be having a ding-dong go down at Seddul-Bahr judging by the roar of cannon.
12 Roused out at 3 this morning expecting to make an attack on enemy trenches, the 6th Battn Infantry 6th L.H. Regt made a bayonet charge on our right captured a trench. They had 11 killed 23 wounded. We heard the British forces in the South had done well, they get it pretty rough down there at times. Hurrah, get letters from home. We formed our new bomb party to day expecting to do great things. They call us the "Suicide Club".
13 Marched down to beach again this morning for more fatigue work, but didnt remain long as the Turks Artillery got to work on us, several 5 of our lads hit. Parsons myself got clear again. Our 6th Reinfts arrived this morning, also some of our lads who went away early in the Campaign with wounds and are now fit again. Turks shell beach again this evening doing little damage
