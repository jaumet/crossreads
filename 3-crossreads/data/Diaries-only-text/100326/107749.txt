9/9/15 Very Cold at the stand to arms. Coy reports slow in coming in as orderlies lost their way in the dark. A lovely morning. Looking over the sea from near the mess "dug out" the scene was something to remember. Not a ripple on the sea and all the fleet lying placidly at anchor except for a monitor spitting an occasional shell towards Abdul the Damned. Through the cliffs a glimpse of the flat stretch leading to the hills beyond Shoubra just like a glimpse of Australian scenery small puffs of white bursting miles away. Shoubra Bay full of shipping. Aeroplane overhead. Bursting shells round it left delicious creamy white little clouds which seemed in no hurry to dissolve but slowly melted away. Quiet afternoon and early evenings. Great many of all corps. on fatigue 
9pm Ruse. flares tins moving sandbags bayonets etc followed by furious cannonade on both sides of m. guns rifles bombs Abdul had his flares up in 30 sec. Stood next to Capt Abbott in firing line and hail of lead tore overhead zipping into sandbags and flame bullets streaming back from us hellish din. Returning got lost on hillside wandering about under fire for  hour but bed 2230
