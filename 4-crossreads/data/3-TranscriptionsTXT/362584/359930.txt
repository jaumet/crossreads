Dear Mrs Ferguson
I was greatly shocked to hear of Arthur's death. We were very close friends, & had known each other for many years, as we were at School together, fellow Students together at College & brother Officers in the 25th Infantry.
I shall miss him as one of my best chums & as a friend that anyone would be proud of. I sincerely sympathise with you in your sad bereavement. Kindly remember me to His Honor & to Dorothy & convey my sympathy to them.
