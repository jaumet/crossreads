 1/8 /19 Cape Town that we were in quarantin , a misrepresent which has led to all the troubl . The troop were given general leav and I went up to the Castl by car . Once away from the Dock Cape Town reveal itself as a town and not a citi . It is noth like as big as I expect and resembl a big Australian provinci town . Plenti of gum heighten the resembl . Ugli nigger abound . Through the main street to the Castl a peculiar sort of half Citadel half barrack place where I saw of a full Colonel ? a funni old South African bird and offici complain about their blunder yesterday . From here to see Gener Ravenshaw the G.O.C. at Mt Nelson hotel .
