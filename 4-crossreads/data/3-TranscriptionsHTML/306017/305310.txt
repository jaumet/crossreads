<p>January 1916<br/>fallen.  I have received quite a lot of mail lately especially papers.  Parcels are a "wash out now that the New Year is well in.  I have got most of my letters answered.  I have met several chaps lately I knew before, among them are Les Whipp, Eric McMurtrie, McCulloch &amp; Jack Hickey.  I was also told that Keating was in camp here but I do not know what units most of them are serving with.  Jean McCarthy of Deer Vale has gone back into hospital again, this time with a sprained ankle.  I made a new allotment of my pay.  Our back money which was due to me is not going to be paid is the money we did not draw at Anzac, so I am down on to 3/5 a day, &amp; the allotment I made will now amount to 5/1</p>
<p>20th Janry to 31st  General Birdwood came out &amp; inspected us.  We marched past him in Squadron Column.  We had another route</p>
