<p>2-5-16  Tuesday<br/>We went out last evening to practice entrenching while in full kit the Ground where I was located was as hard as iron, when my entrenching tool hit the ground it rang like a bell we had to dig while lying down &amp; it was no joke.  I broke my wristlet watch barked my elbows &amp; scratched my equipment all over to say nothing of being covered with dirt.<br/>Skinner E.J. died the day before yesterday the circumstances were rather pathetic he paraded sick was sent back to duty without treatment as O.K. he paraded again was sent to Hospital &amp; died two days after.  He was buried today I was one of the firing party.  The coffin was placed on a Transport Waggon &amp; Pipers played their  <strike>dead</strike>  own dead March. (a Lament) we had great difficulty in keeping step with them.  Skinner is the first of the 10th to go over.  Tonkin is leaving us to go</p>
