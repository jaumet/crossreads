I have only been sea-sick one day so far but even then able to go to each meal. We are feeling the heat a little but not too much.<br/>We have had rather exciting times since I wrote you. We were not allowed Shore-leave at Brisbane &ndash; Had three [words censored] so had to leave them there. We arrived at Pinkenba Pier (Queensland) at 1.30.pm. Thursday  <strike>but</strike> Were told we could all go off until 9.p.m. hurried &amp;  dressed for shore then just about to leave boat when Major came    &amp; said "No Shore leave". &ndash; we thought he was only joking but it was too true. We all settled down &amp;  made the most of it. The men (soldiers) were very good &amp; contented &amp; amused themselves by talking &amp;  joking with the crowd on the pier. They had a lot of school youngsters lined up singing Tipperary &amp; other Patriotic Songs. The best one getting some money. We had great excitement watching the troops embark the next day. A band was playing on the pier until we sailed away.<br/></p>
