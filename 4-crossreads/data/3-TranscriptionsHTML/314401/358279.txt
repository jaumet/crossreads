<p>addressed the ships company, tense with suppressed eagerness &amp; emotion. His words were few but manly &amp; straight;  [indecipherable] to appeal to the gallery. No heroics no purple Napoleonic patches, but a simple straight forward statement. First he told us where we were &amp; what he intended to do. The plan of action he outlined was that tonight before the moon rose at 10.15 the destroyers supported by the Sydney would make an attack on the harbour. We would stand off about ten miles ready to support the attack or to rush in at the first sign. He said he did not know if the German ships were there, it was possible we might come upon them in the open sea. He did not think that we shd. make one attack until tomorrow morning and added that this is no tin pot navy but an efficient branch of the Empire fleet. The Captain followed him, but only added that as the destroyers went past us on their dangerous mission tonight we were to cheer them on their way. No talk is possible of course except on one absorbing topic. The men find fault with one another on the ground that they are not taking it seriously enough which is almost amusing. "Some of these young Australians" says "Brownie" of X Turret "think they're going to have a battle for nothing. A.B. Bowers, known as Ginger, light hearted at all times, leaning against the breech block of his four inch gun launches forth a tirade against frivolous thoughtlessness of many men. "They don't realise it but they will when shells come flying round". "Ah well" I replied "Never mind, perhaps it is better that they do not take it so seriously. Let every man do his little bit as well as he can and that is all that can be required of him". "That's all very well sir, but &hellip;." But I have gone on to another gun's crew. Our gunlayers are as good as   <strike>may</strike> the best in the Home Fleet. It is said of some of them that they have not missed a target for years. Stanley Mitchell, a staid bearded Scotchman is at the trigger in A Turret and he is credited with the idea of writing his initials on the hull of the opposing ships with twelve inch  projectiles.</p>
