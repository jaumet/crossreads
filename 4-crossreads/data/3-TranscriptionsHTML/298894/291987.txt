<p>Tuesday 2nd September was told off with a party to clear our old lines up &amp; this completed the morning. In the afternoon went and had a first class bath &amp; then to see Andrews. He is now a chaplain but has had some illness and &amp; leaves in a couple of days for England. Bought some Quaker oats 1/8d a pct, for porridge in the mornings &amp; made a little fireplace all complete. First class concert at night by New Zealanders, &amp; some Maoris brought the house down with a Haka twice repeated.<br/>Wednesday 3rd September On guard, the first time for some 5 months. First guard was from 3AM to 7 AM but I did not turn out till 5AM as it was all nonsense having a guard at all So I took a risk &amp; slept in. Made porridge this morning &amp; toast, both of which proved very acceptable. Spent the morning printing some more photos. Guard again 3P.M.till 7P.M.<br/>Thursday 4th had a day off &amp; went across to see the 1st A.S.H. again . The weather was very rough and going across in the ferry I managed to get somewhat drenched &amp; rain coming on completed the job. The sun coming out during the afternoon dried me again O.K. I managed to pick up a registered parcel of printing paper sent me, from the post office &amp;  in the village collected some coins, &amp; buttons &amp; bought some spring onions &amp; skin shoes as worn by the natives to send home as</p>
