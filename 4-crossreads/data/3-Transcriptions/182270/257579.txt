<p>Fine &amp; hot. Rode out about 25 miles</p>
<p>next day with Newman and</p>
<p>inspected the country. It is</p>
<p>pretty good country and will</p>
<p>keep stock in good nick I</p>
<p>think. Mooki cattle have been</p>
<p>running there &amp; look good.</p>
<p>Redman met me in Tuncurry</p>
<p>and took me back to Taree.</p>
