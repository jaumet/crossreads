 this Camp. Military police dog us about to make sure "we have chin straps down and puttees rolled properly." 
 May 5th:- Left Fovant tonight on draft for France. Had plenty of hot tea in my water bottle &amp; some bread, and biscuits in my haversack. At 4.30 P.M. we paraded for inspection, and our friends came down to see us off  with  offering all kinds of good wishes, and advice to "keep your head s  down." We moved off to the Railway station in full marching order, the camp band playing us a farewell tune. At Dinton Miss Penruddock met me. The departure of a draft is always a gloomy affair, but for awhile the gloom was dispelled by the cheerful manner and kind farewells this lady addressed to us. She went among us giving out postcards, and advising each boy to write home. Then she collected them for posting. At 6 P.M. the troop train left Dinton for an unknown destination. 
 May 6th:- At 3.30 am the troops were ordered out of the train. The place proved to be Shorncliffe. We were met by some guides with lanterns, and marched away in the darkness. An hour later we were lodged in our billets which proved to be an area of large mansions in  the town of  Folkstone,  which  fenced off from the rest of the town. The rooms were unfurnished; we slept on the floor. Had a rasher s  of bacon, a slice of bread, &amp; a Dixie of tea at 7. am. At 2 PM we marched out of this rest camp, along the Marine Parade, thence to the wharf, and boarded the  piquet  boat for France. I go to the field s  of death, calmly, confidently and hopefully.
