<p>Glasgow is very much bigger than Edinburgh, &amp; I like the place very much. Electric trams are the principal means of conveyance, &amp; they are very cheap too, you can go a long way for halfpenny. There are some very fine buildings here, &amp; the streets are nice &amp; wide. One thing as struck me as being peculiar &amp; that was, how the people have to line up in the streets to gain admittance into a picture show or a theatre, another was a threepenny &amp; sixpenny shop, a place where everything is purchased at 3d. or 6d. or a quantity at the same price. Things are very cheap.</p>
<p>Everybody seems very obliging &amp; sociable. I had a good look round Glasgow this afternoon on trams, at times walking. I also visited a wax works place which was not very interesting, especially to anyone with not too much money. It rained during the afternoon, &amp; continued throughout the night. The Y.M.C.A. people are very good &amp; obliging, money, valuable, &amp; packs are taken care of without any extra charge. Some of the scotch people talk very broad here, at times I can hardly understand them. There are a good few Australians up here on leave.</p>
