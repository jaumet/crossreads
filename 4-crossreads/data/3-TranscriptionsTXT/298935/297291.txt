water and Lord Kitchener had promised to be present at the opening ceremony.  At one end of the courtyard is the "wishing altar".  This is composed of 5 slabs of stone standing on end in a line, with another slab lying on the top of them.  By walking through the spaces between the slabs you are supposed to gain good luck and also your wish.  The dome of the mosque is substantial being 225 ft high 60 ft in diameter and having walls 12 ft thick.  A bronze door inlaid with gold and silver was taken away from here by Napoleon but a duplicate costing 14,000 has been made.  A cannon ball fired by Napoleon's gunners can be seen today embedded in an outside wall.In the second mosque is said to be the finest tomb in Egypt
