  
 3 success may come to some and dreams may in part come true. The long long lane which some have trudged for years may take a turn from the desert of weary endeavour into the rich pasture lands of rest and ease. 
 All things must wait now till I make life for you and the children better. That is the first duty which I have been struggling for a long time now, but I see I must try harder yet. Adverse have been the winds for a long time but a time must come at last dear Bec. 
 Keep yourself and the children bright and merry and hope for the best. Life is so short, far too short to do those great things we set out to do. but not too short to find that kind hearts are worth more than great heads after all.
