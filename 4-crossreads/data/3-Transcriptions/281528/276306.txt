<p>11/4/18 - Lavieville<br/>Reached a cellar in the residence of the late Mayor of this village.  Here were good beds with white sheets rifled from Madame's deserted linen press.  Such a scene of desolation would break anyone's heart &ndash; to think of these poor folk their homes fast being blown to pieces and all their property abandoned to a soldiery.  As yet the house is fairly intact but shells are falling all round and there are batteries very close alongside.  Had a late supper early this morning upstairs.  Did not get up until noon and my batman then had a bath ready for me.  Clothes &amp;c all lying round</p>
