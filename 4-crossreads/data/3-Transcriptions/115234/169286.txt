<p>since we were in &quot;Bayonet&quot; trench at &quot;<u>Flers</u>&quot; last year.&nbsp; Got home to the Dugout dog-tired &amp; my pal. &quot;<u>Dutchy</u>&quot; had a big fire blazing &amp; some prime &quot;Coffee Au Lait&quot; simmering thereon:</p>
<p><u>13<sup>th</sup></u>&nbsp; Went &amp; saw the quack this morning.&nbsp; One of the shells had dropped on my big toe &amp; squashed it considerable.&nbsp; No Duty for me tonight. So for once Fritz will not have me for a target.</p>
