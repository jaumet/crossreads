Rolled out at 8.30
Quite a change from our usual revielle at nine thirty went up to the Signal Office to report to the Maj, the office is a beaut, employing about 20 operators working Wheatstone, duplex, simplex vibrater, its run on the lines of a Post Office, the only difference is that the fellows are in uniform. The procedure is exceptionally good many a good point is to be seen especially with their counter work, they keep a graph as to the days traffic, also pole diagrams communication plans galore instead of dealing in dockets they have slips when receipted they paste them on the back of the original. separate registers are used for all forms. Met Achi Yep during the afternoon.
