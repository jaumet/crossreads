 Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George, 
 Just a few lines as I may not be able to write for some days.  We expect to leave for Bulford again on Saturday.  I sent all my Patients away to-day &amp; had to hand back all the equipment from my lines accomodating 204 men. 
 Needless to say I could not possibly do it with only one pair of hands.  I have 12 Marquees &amp; cannot be expected to let a bit of me sleep on the premises in each one to guard the stores etc, so
