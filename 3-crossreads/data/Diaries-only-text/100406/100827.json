Capt. Lang gave a Lecture on aeroplanes, incidentally describing his own World's record flight on a D (or V) H9 fitted with a Napier Lion Engine. This machine could have undoubtedly bombed Berlin. Running well in Handicap Chess Tourney but withdrew.

28.6, Sunday
Woke up this morning in sight of land and in smooth water. Crow-eaters greatly excited. Anchored at Port Adelaide 1.20 P.M. waiting for medical inspection. Temperatures taken by Health Officers. Berthed at about 10.30 P.M.
Monday, 30th June
Crow-eaters disembarked before 9.0 A.M., very few people about. One Sammy Lunn or Lum made enough fuss for a few. He is by way of being a Rhymester. There is nothing to sea at Port Adelaide but the Railway Station a few shops. We left there at 2.0 P.M. Sammy howled out some complimentary remarks through his megaphone "you Bonzers", you Beauties, etc.
