<p>OCTOBER &nbsp; SATURDAY 7 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine except for a couple of very light showers in afternoon. The 7<s><sup>​</sup></s><sup>​th</sup>&nbsp;Brigade held a Gymkana &amp; it was a great success.I had to go to Durrington &nbsp;to look for some waggon loads of manure that had gone astray in morning &amp; got back before dinner. I had (Lieut) Col Richards horse &amp; he was not a bad jumper, but I didnt win anything with him. The 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;Battery won more events than any other. I was in the wrestling on horseback team &amp; we won. I was on stable picket at night. Saw Billy White, Jo Clonan, Jack Massey &amp; Pop Lloyd there. Got a parcel (a waistcoat) from Linda &amp; a Qdi Gazette from mother</p>
