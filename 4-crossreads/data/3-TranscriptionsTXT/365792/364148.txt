 Mch 7 this afternoon &amp; in the interval we went for a swim clad in boots, sox, hat &amp; overcoat. Very nice, very cool Had a boska dip. Clothes were steamed &amp; you should have seen the mob rushing to get their clobber. Some were a sock short &amp; others a shirt or a pair of breeks. [in margin] AH
