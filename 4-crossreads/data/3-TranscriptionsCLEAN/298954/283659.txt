  
 On the chilly beach with dozens of others (from Captains down) I manage to get a fire in going in the old bogey & juggle the two billies over the fire till the porridge & tea is ready (I have progressed far since that day long ago in Karlsruhe when I looked helplessly at the ingredients of a pie.) 
 After breakfast (our barrack is dormitory, - salle-a-manger, & lounge all in one) I "wash-up", peel the potatoes for dinner & am then free to lounge about and gossip with the chefs next door till 10.45 or so. 
 Till noon I am busy preparing "dinner"; today's menu being:- "Camp Pie" (a tinned substance) boiled potatoes Compote of rice and apricots (dried) Bread and dripping Tea. 
 This menu is exceptionally ample, packets being plentiful at present. 
 My compote was much admired;  I was quite proud of it.
