 Dear Dad, Mother & George, 
 We arrived here at noon yesterday.  Leaving Fovant at 6.30 p.m. we arrived without incident after a pretty cool trip at our Port at 3 a.m.  We talked & yarned & supped until 5 a.m. & then gradually dropped off to sleep.  (One) feather beds are pretty hard nevertheless we slept well for a couple of Hours & left our Port at 10 a.m.  We went down the Town after Tea & had a good meal of steak& eggs, with lovely grapes as dessert.  The place is very old & very dirty in the part that we visited.  We were glad to walk up the Hill Home again away from the numerous nasty smells.  I noticed that there is no water laid on.  Jack & Jill have to fetch their water, the Taps
