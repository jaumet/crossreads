<p>2.  place called Forant.  I arrived at 8.30 am &amp; then had to cycle another 2 &frac12; miles to another Camp.  I had finished my Business at 12 noon &amp; rode the 8 miles back to Salisbury.  I spent the afternoon with my other Friends &amp; went to the theatre at night.  Since then I have not been out of the Camp &amp; will not go to Salisbury until next Saturday   [indecipherable]<br/>It was an awful Tornado that you had when the fence was blown down.  We had an 80 mile Gale the day after I crossed to the Isle of Man last time.  Gee it was rough.  Just fancy the Tossing You got, for 6 &frac12; Hours or more &amp; no where to go to get out of the wind &amp; spray except in the Cabin with everyone sick.  Gee, it is awful, but the good Time I have in the Island makes up for it.<br/>I began this letter last night, but I had to go to bed before I could finish it.  It is after 8 pm now &amp; I am pretty tired.  Ellis &amp; I have just returned from a Tour round the Block, Just half-an-hours walk.  It was quite amusing.  There are about 300 Girl Volunteers now here called the Womens Army Auxiliary Corps.  W.A.A.C. or Wack-acks as the boys call them.  Of course it is just lovely for the Boys &amp; every Girl is in great demand.  There they go up &amp; down, arms rounds necks &amp; waists, groups chatting under the Lamps &amp; telling stories round dark</p>
