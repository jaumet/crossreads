<p>Thursday 28.12.16<br/>Walked to Vignacourt, but was unable to get back for hours owing to trouble with my feet.  While waiting there was caught by cold &amp; would have fainted only for the timely assistance of "Bobbie Roberts" who was in the village temporarily attached to a "Pierrot" show.  Not feeling at all well.</p>
<p>Friday 29.12.16<br/>Admitted to hospital with "trench feet" Rained during day.</p>
