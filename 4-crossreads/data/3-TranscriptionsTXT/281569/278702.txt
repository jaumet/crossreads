 Up at 5 
 Set sail for Pt Said at 0530 &amp; caught the train OK arriving at Kantara about 0700 where we had to wait until 1130 before we got a return. Got into Pt Said at 1 &amp; first of all looked for sleeping quarters &amp; were fixed up at Hotel de-la-poste where we started off with an excellent feed then went for a stroll, the city is very clean &amp; very modern although the Italians are in the majority as usual, music is to be heard at every resturant. We spent nearly all our time in eating houses &amp; [indecipherable] cafes, after tea hired a garry &amp; went to the seashore where hundreds were bathing, drove all round &amp; finished up with two melons for supper, retired full &amp; tired.
