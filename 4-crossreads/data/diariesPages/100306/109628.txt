26/12/16 Zenith, Spectrum, Gusty Trenches
A very busy night almost as many telephones as an Exchange. Our right party for strong post got lost and we had no tidings of them at all until about  to 1 when they reported all correct. Awful mud and conditions. One poor devil lost his boots and was wandering about in bare feet. Gusty being too crowded we shifted a few back to Millars Son. After getting in, the ration men had to go back and cart their food up and orders also arrived for a patrol to go out. Arranged all this by telephone and heaved a great sigh of relief when at last the welcome message arrived "Relief complete". Sitting in this deep dugout with 35 feet of earth on top and a staff of runners and signallers I control all this area. The R.S.M. leaves in the morning with VD contracted from a mademoiselle in Flesselles. The Doctor is bad with bronchitis and says he thinks he is getting T.B. This absolutely the worst Xmas in my life so far and we shall be up here again on New Years Day.
