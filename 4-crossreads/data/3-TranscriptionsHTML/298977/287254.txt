<p>-2- 6th September 1916.</p>
<p>just over the Border.  It has not been much affected by the way, except for a daily visitation of long range shells, which have not so far done much damage.  The chief occupation of the people in the town is lace making at which they are very clever.  There are many fine shops, at which we can get almost anything including Australian fruit, but you need a fortune to buy anything with.</p>
<p>We went through a fine Church this morning, built to the usual grandeur of French Churches, but most of the more valuable paintings etc. have been removed for safety.  The most wonderful thing of all though is the fact that the inhabitants mostly all speak English, in fact better English than we do.  I say "Better" because I'm afraid we've nearly forgotten how to talk Kings English.  Our conversations now are a mixture of Arabic, French and English.  It's a pleasure though to be able to talk to a girl without having to think for half an hour of the French for what we want to say.</p>
<p>A group of us, all old hands, had our photo taken in the last town we were in, and when they come to hand will forward one on, but if I get to England will have one taken separately.</p>
<p>By the way I'm sorry to say that Stan Crasks was rather severely wounded at Pozieres.  He was hit in both arms and legs but from what I could find out, he is not expected to lose any limbs.</p>
<p>We are expecting a big mail before we leave here, so will hold this over in case there is some questions that need answering.</p>
<p>I have felt particularly well since I've been in France (yes, I'm touching wood), but am afraid am getting too fat.  Harry is also O.K. and wishes to be kindly remembered to you all.  I think I told you before he is a full blown Sergeant now, and I fully expect to have to salute him before long.</p>
<p>Well this has been rather an effort, and a bit of a record for me lately.  Many thanks for the weekly epistles.  Please keep them going.</p>
<p>Love to All,<br/>from<br/>Your affectionate brother,<br/>Roy.</p>
