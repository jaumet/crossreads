<p>faith in things. We know that there are plenty of troops in the neighbourhood, guns are going forward, the general routine is going on as before so all is well.   Had a fairly busy day with sick but we did not evacuate as many as before owing to the number going sick.   Had one Tommy in, a relic of the retreat.   He was nearly handed over to a guard as a deserter but I managed to get him off &amp; after warning him what would happen if he was caught again, sent him off the report to the first English unit he could find.   He had been loose for 5 days having bolted when the hun was attacking albert. Wrote a few short letters during the evening.  Paper reports give German official as 40,000 prisoners &amp; 600 guns with an advance on a 50 mile front, in a deepest part to a distance of 37 &frac12; miles, yet we are still undaunted.</p>
<p>Sunday 31st March<br/>   Had a busy day with sick, &amp; issuing dressings to Battalions.   Had a welcome sight of 200 Huns marched through the village, they had been captured</p>
