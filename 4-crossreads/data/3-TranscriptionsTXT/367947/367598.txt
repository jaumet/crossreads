 [Letterhead of 3rd Light Horse Brigade] 8th June 1916. 
 My dear old Jack &amp; Clare, Got your (Jack's) letter of 23 April to day &amp; got one from Clare a couple of weeks ago. 
 Well I'm glad to see that things are all well so far. Very sorry to hear about Ted &amp; I hope he has fully recovered by this. Also that he was not out of work long through it all. My word the kidlets must be growing. I suppose they are "some" handful by now. Hope the Arbitration award panned out satisfactorily to all concerned. 
 Give my love to Ede Al &amp; all of the folk. Uncle Will wrote &amp; told me they had had a splendid trip up you way as far as Mt Morgan. He was then off to Mildura for a few days. I wrote you all a post card last week. Remember me to Bob Anderson &amp; tell him I'll write shortly. My word the works must be like old times with all those hands up there. 
 I am out in the desert still &amp; at present with another officer &amp; two troops stationed well out. We are having a glorious time as far as soldiering goes, and appear to be quite safe from any attacks. Of course everyone wants something to happen, but that sort of skite comes from the new bloods. All the old hands recognise the good wicket they are on &amp; say nix.
