<p>On outpost at night by Trunie&#39;s Tel,</p>
<p>In the ghostly hours, you remember well</p>
<p>The tales of goblins, who used to dwell</p>
<p>In olden day romances.</p>
<p>For the Tel itself is a grave yard grim,</p>
<p>And, as you watch by its northern rim</p>
<p>Out file the ghosts and spectres dim</p>
<p>To hold their mid-night dances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see dark forms of Infidels there,</p>
<p>Who were soldiers good with courage rare;</p>
<p>But who died by the sword of a Saxon fair -</p>
<p>A chivalrous Crusader.</p>
<p>And you feel your hair from you head-top straining;</p>
<p>As you see, through the stones their life-blood&#39;s draining</p>
<p>From mortal wounds, yet still they&#39;re straining</p>
<p>To fight this new invader</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But your wits fly back if you hear a rap,</p>
<p>Or down in the waddi a dry twig snap;</p>
<p>For you know that you&#39;re caught in a hopeless trap</p>
<p>If the Turkish host&#39;s advancing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But at stand-to-arms near the break of day</p>
<p>Your courage returns and you feel quite gay -</p>
<p>Still you&#39;re more than contented to ride away</p>
<p>And leave the ghosts to their dancing.</p>
<p>Windy Willie.</p>
