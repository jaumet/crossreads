<p>Tuesday 4th March<br/>In morning visited Cotford Camp under Col Rankin and Heytesbury Camp (late RBAA) under Major Dixon. Both camps very comfortable and convenient.<br/>Miserable cool day.   Remained in doors all the afternoon.</p>
<p>Wednesday 5th March<br/>Departed for London with Gen McCay at 10 am and returned to Tidworth at 8pm.<br/>Called at A.I.F HQrs, saw Gen Griffiths, House and White also Gen Birdwood.

Capt Thomas AAMC examined my arm in the presence of Col McIlhone ADMS and will arrange special electrical apparatus in my room at Tidworth. A very beautiful day and a most enjoyable run.<br/>Col Lord reported for duty but as the Tasmanian Government wants him back I am tomorrow sending him to London to make necessary arrangements for early return.<br/>HMAS "Melbourne" and Destroyer left Devonport today.</p>
<p>Friday 7th March<br/>Visited Sutton Veny Camps and returned to Tidworth at 1pm.  1st Camp under Col Clark does not appear too satisfactory, but other camps seem to be doing well. The Messing Officer with Col Mullins at Sutton Veny is a very live man. Did not have time to visit Hospital.<br/>Dinner and dance to Gen McCay.</p>
