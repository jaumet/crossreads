  
 5.  have several things to take into consideration before I move away from here.  One is that if once I move from here I cannot land here again, as no more women are allowed here.  Another is the submarine haunted Mediterranean, & a whole lot of "ifs" about where our boys might be sent if any of them should get sick.  For the present then I can only just wait & see how things develop & in the meantime do what I can here.   Wal is my last link here, though I rather dread the thought of England with its aeroplanes and the slimy submarines between here & there, unless there is some actual use in going there & then of course it would be different. Ladies who have helped both in England and in France have shown me that it is of no use hoping to be able to help in hospital work or anything of that sort in either of these places, they say the places are over run with them & I can see that it would be only through Rid being in one himself & through his influence that I would be allowed anywhere near him.  Evidently there are so many visitors & inquiries for friends and all that sort of thing that the general work of the hospitals is impeded. Sister Lucie here whom I think I mentioned in connection with some secretarial work she does for the Y.M.C.A. on the floor above, said that even if my husband were sick in hospital in France I should have the greatest difficulty in getting in & out to see him, & unfortunately she knows.  However there may be no need for all my conjectures, but I like you to know what I know, & it will all help to explain any cable that I might have to send, though I am not contemplating any just now.
