 Wed June 26th - The Day This is the 3rd Anniversari of the wonder 26th . It is a glorious day , just such a one as it was in 1915 . I hop out of my blanket bright and earli this morn , feel almost well again . The Day must have cure me . Went down to Y.M. , but there was noth do . Got word to proceed into Weymouth and see Eye-Specialist at Red Barrack . He was a civilian and veri nice old chap he was too . It was quit a treat to be spoken to like a man , instead of get your head snap off , as our M.O. 's do . He said my eyesight was not bad , but that I ought to wear glass . He gave me a prescript and said that they would let me know when the " spec " were readi . After leav Red Barrack I took a stroll along the Prom and arriv back in Camp just too late for dinner . I wonder if M.S. is think of me today . Whi of cours she is . I wrote a good long Letter . No 27 , After Tea I manag to get back to Town where I had a Feed of Chip , Fish was "off" . As I was cross the Bridg on my way back to Camp I pass a veri prepossess damsel who gave me the " Glad eye" . I was about to respond ? but check myself . Well , I ve been good so far , I must keep it up now . And I turn into my Blanket about 10 feel veri lone and long for a pair of dimpl arm around my neck again .
