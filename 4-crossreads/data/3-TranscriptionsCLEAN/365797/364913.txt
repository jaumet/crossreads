Dene GullySaturday. 4.6.15.
My dear old Alan,Your letter has just come & we are so disappointed that you are not to be home for dinner tomorrow.
Each day since you wrote we have been hoping for a wire to say you were coming. I am so sorry I didn't do what I wanted to do after your first letter - wire you some money but Father said perhaps you would be on your way home. I shall wire it on Tuesday morning - Monday is a holiday alas!
Your last instalment for Dene is here & we are expecting him tomorrow so that he can leave an order for me to get that too. I intend running down to see if Uncle Jim is home this week end & ask him what can be done to get you off for a few days. He goes about the 7th so perhaps you may go on his boat - they say he is to go in command but I don't know definitely.
There are ever so many letters here for you, I will send Dene's & Una's & wait to send the others.
Uncle Jim is going in the Ceramic and is Major of 19th Battalion, 2nd Company.
[The following text is written along the left-hand margin:]Hazel is better - your letters in Egypt will have all the home news & I sent for some socks - will Tommie get your letters for you? All the girls have been
