<p>Well to return to your epistle, referring to your letter from "Burrabogie", I'm afraid you weren't on your best behaviour there.  Its quite time I came back that is if I am any restraining influence which I doubt.  But I'm hoping that your new found vocation will do a lot for you.</p>
<p>I'm glad its going on well &amp; that you find its a refuge &amp; a solace.  But my word you'll have to grind.  You should do all right.</p>
<p>Oh Stuart sent me two snaps, one of Graham &amp; Lerida &amp; one of them blowing bubbles.  He is dear kid &amp; how like the Boss.</p>
<p>By the way I wrote the Boss &amp; very next day got another from him.  He's a brick &amp; please tell him so.  I hope it won't offend him if I tell him his letters are extremely funny.  I chuckle &amp; giggle.</p>
<p>I have no news my dear, things are rather slow,</p>
