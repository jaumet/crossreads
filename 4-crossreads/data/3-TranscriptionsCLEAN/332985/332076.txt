Cold and frosty morning.  On the move again tomorrow.  All horses to have frost coggs in shoes.  Horses recieved from 22nd Bty. in an awful state as regards shoes.  Had to shoe 20 today ready for the roads tomorrow.
26-1-1917Left Rainneville at 9-15 a.m.  I was working at 5 a.m. with my shoeing smiths, putting frost coggs in shoes ready for the march.  This is drivers work not mine.  I have quite enough to do to keep the horses shod.  Anyhow we got most of them done.  Cold as a frog, hands almost frozen.  Arrived at Behencourt 2 p.m., hard frost, bitterly cold.  In passable billets, some of our horses under cover, others in a stable with no roof, likely to move into action on the 28 inst.  Our journey today 6 miles.
27-1-1917Still cold and frosty.  Hun aeroplane over.  Going into action in a day or two, one section at a time.
