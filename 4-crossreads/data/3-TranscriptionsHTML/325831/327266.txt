<p>3.<br/>Well, after I came out (the very next day in fact) General Birdwood came &amp; personally thanked me &amp; sent me off straightaway to England for six days rest. Since I have returned I held a Parade of the whole Brigade &amp; thanked them. They were not all there of course, for many are still lying cold &amp; stark close to the trenches they so gallantly charged, without thought of danger; it was enough for them that I wished it, there was no question, no hanging back. They played their hand &amp; although they went under, they won.</p>
<p>On 31st Dec I am going to the command of a Division with a step in rank &amp; although I am going on &amp; I deeply appreciate the trust that is reposed in me in placing me in command of 20,000 men of all arms on active service, &amp; further, that I realise I am attaining the acme of my military ambition in rising from Bugler in 1874 to Major General commanding a Division in the Field in the greatest War in history, I shall part with very great regret from the Brigade which has always done so well. Well, enough of War. I am sorry when in London I did not call on your cousin Campbell Williams. I only got your letter containing his address on my return to France, but I promise to look him up when I go again.</p>
<p>I send my kindest regards to your wife, Miss Baass, Rita, Miss Foster &amp; to Mr McNamara. Remember me also to the President &amp; Members of the Board &amp; all my brother &amp; sister officers there, to my dear friends Mr Keele &amp; Mr Garrard. Tell them, although strenuously engaged here, I do not forget the good old days in Sydney &amp; their kindness to me. I am sorry that so many connected in one way &amp; another with the Board have gone under here &amp; yet I am not sorry, for after all they were only a bit ahead of their time &amp; it was well worth it &amp; they died game &amp; would do the same again.</p>
<p>The saddle you gave me is worth its weight in gold &amp; every time I climb into it I think of my dear old pal, Harry Williams, &amp; that means a lot to me.</p>
<p>Au revoir, Harry old boy. Good luck &amp; God bless you all.</p>
<p>Your sincere pal</p>
<p>Billie Holmes.</p>
