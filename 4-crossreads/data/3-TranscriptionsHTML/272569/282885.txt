<p>Sun. 23-7-'16<br/>Scratchy Wilson wounded thru both arms. Brewer of #10 Platoon badly hit. A nip of rum at midnight very acceptable as no tea possible on a/c fire showing position. We are 700 yds from Poziers &amp; our Enemy. Our Div. took R. side of this imp. Village &amp; as I write the Tommies are shelling their portion preparatory to attacking it &amp; capturing it. Bill Barbour &amp; other Orig. #7 of Peninsula fame admit that this is much worse than ever they had on Penin. "It was Child's play compared to this" said one. We managed to secure another w'proof sheet &amp; O'coat which had been dumped by the other B'gade. Very acceptable.</p>
