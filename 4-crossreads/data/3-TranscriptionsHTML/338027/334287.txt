<p>Thursday, 17th December, 1914<br/>Ideal weather is the rule of climate in Egypt.  The winters are perfect.  The view of the Pyramids &amp; Nile at sunset is magnificent.  I went on leave at night to Cairo and had an enjoyable time.  It is a magnificent town and its buildings are most modern.  You want to spend some months in it before you really appreciate it.  Whilst there I called on the editor of Egyptian News &amp; had a chat I may do some work for him.</p>
<p>Friday, 18th December, 1914<br/>On Day stable picquet all day from 6.30 to 6.30, horses breaking loose all day, the method of picketing horses is very unsatisfactory.  Nearly all horses suffering from cracked heels.</p>
<p>To-day 101 guns were fired from the Citadel announcing that Egypt is now a British protectorate the taking over ceremony is to be held in Cairo on Sunday.  It is not really an annexation but taking it over as a British protectorate, the Egyptians are allowed their own rulers under British.  The newly appointed Sultan is H. J. Hussein 1st [Hussein Kamel] in place of the late Khedive who has gone over to the Turks.</p>
<p>Saturday, 19th December, 1914<br/>My turn for day leave could not take it owing to lack of funds gave it away.  Had a splendid job all day, Military Police.  We are getting splendid news from the front.  Allies victories but cannot account for German bombardment of English coast.  The men took it pretty seriously as Scarborough is the native place of one of the men.  We are all itching to get to the front or see some fighting, this camp is deadly monotonous.  We are now allowed 6d a day worth of extra provisions a man so we are living much better.</p>
<p>Sunday, 20th December, 1914<br/>Church Parade in morning one for each denomination.  Ours was a good one, a fine military sermon was preached.  In the afternoon we were marched for a shower bath about 3 miles through Maadi along the banks of the picturesque Nile thence to the native prison, whose baths were placed at our disposal.  They were lovely and badly needed in a large room to hold the lot of us, firstly hot showers then gradually cooler to cold.  They refreshed us so much that we marched back whistling &amp; singing the Marsellaise, to the delight of the French residents who cheered and applauded us.</p>
