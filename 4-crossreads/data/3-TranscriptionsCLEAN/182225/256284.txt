1916   WEDNESDAY 14   JUNE
A murky dull day but as there was no wind it was not too cold. The 9th Brigade & a few of our fellows went ashore in morning for a route march. I had a buzzer lecture in morning, and Mr Neylan set up a helio for us but we got no practice with it. A lot of the fellows went our for a row in afternoon the rest had a tug of war on the promenade deck. Sent a cable to Linda & asked her to reply so ought to get an answer tomorrow. The 9th played [little?] hell on shore & most of them came back drunk & lots did not come back at all.
