<p>My dear Aunty<br/>I received your letter also parcel (which was very welcome) last week, thanks very much for them. I was badly in need of socks when your parcel arrived, I had only one pair &amp; they were nearly worn out, so you see they were just the thing.</p>
<p>I was very sorry to hear that Charley was wounded, I did not hear anything about it till two days afterwards, when I was told he was killed, it was not till about a month later that I found out he was to return to Australia. Hope his arm gets alright soon.</p>
<p>We have had no fighting since the 9th Aug. but will probably have something to do before long</p>
