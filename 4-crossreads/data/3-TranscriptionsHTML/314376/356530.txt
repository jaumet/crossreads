<p>219<br/>would have a route march for a long distance. At other times we would be taken out for rifle shooting on the range.</p>
<p>About the middle of July we were taken out to a place called Maillet-Maillet for training. It was here we were addressed by Mr Holman who came over to inspect us.</p>
<p>He extended an invitation to anyman who had a request to make that he came forward when the Brigade was marching off. We had a very steep hill to master before we reached our destination. Our accommodation at this place was very limited. We slept in huts that were smaller than the usual "Nissan" hut. Some of the men erected smaller huts</p>
