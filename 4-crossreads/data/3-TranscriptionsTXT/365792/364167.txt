Mch 31 big farmhouse about 15 miles from the trenches & 41/2 from St Omer. Our possie is a machine shed; damp floor, & little, or no, straw, but one doesn't mind, because the surroundings are beautiful (so different to Egypt)  We went to a small village where the Tommies are billeted, & then marched back here with the old band ahead playing like one thing. Bully-beef, biscuits & jam for brek, but plenty of planes to gaze at, & a couple of nice girls - (but what are 2 among so many). Secured a tin & a small bucket, & dipped some water out of the pond & got rid of much dirt. Must shave later on. Jolly heavy frost here. All people employed by or serving the Military wear a yellow arm- badge as a distinguishing mark. Hard luck for us; the Tommies got into the Village ahead of us. Harry & I went to the village & made sundry purchases & swigged some wine Beautiful bread, about 5 lbs
