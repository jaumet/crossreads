<p>Dear Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Have just received parcel containing ginger marshmallows socks &amp;c. and a letter from Father dated February. The parcel was very much appreciated. Poor old Christie died at Sierra Leone on the way home to Australia. He had been very sick for a long time and did not seem to be going to last long. I loved him very much; we all did.</p>
<p>I am at present somewhere in an old Bosche dugout containing two beds 2 armchairs a tiled fireplace with marble top a large writing desk mirrows and electric light fittings. It is a perfectly palatial place the best I have seen. needless to say the electric light is no longer in use. I am quite fit The Colonel has a very heavy cold and gets very little sleep If he gets much worse he must go away for a while.</p>
<p>Some paper that with the Bn. Colours on it. I have also received a large tin of Watsons "B" which was very welcome. I get very fed up with the mushy tobacco you get in France. I have also received Mother's letter dated I6th. September in which she asks about some parcels. I think those must be the ones I have received with socks Watsons "B" and a few other little things. They are all lovely to get anyway.</p>
<p>I think we have a big chance of being out of the line for Christmas.</p>
<p>I have just found also a letter from mother of I9 August.</p>
<p>Tea is just coming in.<br/>Cheerio.<br/>Your affectionate son,<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
