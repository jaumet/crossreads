 Angel Hotel, Liverpool. Letterhead Bulford 2/12/17 Dear Mum,  I have 3 letters of yours to answer but we have had such a cool day to-day that I could not write.  It has been fine &amp; cloudless but too chilly to sit away from the fire &amp; write.  Ellis &amp; I went for a stroll around the Block after 6 pm &amp; we have had Supper &amp; Ellis has gone to bed. Our first parade is to be held at 8 45 am in the morning &amp; during the winter months.  It will be nice &amp; handy.  I will answer Your letters later in the week.  I am enclosing a few snaps.  I must drop a P.C. to Dad &amp; George before "Lights out" is blown We are Happy, Mum Dear.  Do be the same.  We are just O.K. Lots of Love Harry
