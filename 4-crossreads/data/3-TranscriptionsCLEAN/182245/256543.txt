 1917 JANUARY 
 28 SUNDAY 
 Fine & Sunny, but there was a 
 cold wind blowing off the snow. 
 Cleaning up round huts & grooming 
 horses in morning and 
 exercising horses in afternoon 
 I did one of Bill Constable's 
 shifts of horse picket at night 
 Got a parcel of handkerchiefs 
 from M rs  Lloyd & a letter & 
 some snaps from Mother. 
 There was a very big 
 bombardment at night.
