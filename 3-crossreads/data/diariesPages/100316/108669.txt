making for. The 5th Bde on our right did well but the English on our left seem as usual to have failed. They town of Ville-sur-Ancre is in our hands. The Hun officers are said to have remarked on the poor quality and youth of their men and also say that they were on the point of attacking us. A request came down for more officers to be sent up but I was not having any. With a loss of almost 2 companies and only 6 officer casualties the request was not a reasonable one. So I decided to send up Lanyon and King into action and only to be used as necessary. Set off on horseback to arrange things with Sutherland when I met King handed all orders to him and then returned to my billet. The other battalions seem to have suffered lightly compared with ours and the 24th talk of only 20 casualties. The village by Ville sur Ancre is definitely in our hands. Fair numbers of Huns have been seen moving down the roads towards the village and tonight there ought to be a heavy counter attack. My theory re our standing barrage causing us loss 
1. The guns are right the map is wrong.
2. The Caterpillar is marked wrong 
The road is marked wrong
3. The guns are wrong.
It remains to be seen which of these theories is correct.
