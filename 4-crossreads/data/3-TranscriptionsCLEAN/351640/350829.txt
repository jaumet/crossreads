be the famous Emden, which had created so much havoc among merchantmen in the Indian Ocean.   Shortly afterwards a further message came through stating that the capture was no other than that of the Emden, and that the cruiser had gone in pursuit of the collier, which had left Cocos Island early that morning.   We are informed that the exchange of shots between the two vessels was about 600 from the Sydney and a 2000 from the Emden.  The Sydney used 6 inch guns while the Emden had only 4 point 2 inch.

After a wait of 35 minutes the end came peacefully, and one hour later we had our first experience of a funeral on this ship.   Power was 19 years of age and a native of Victoria, where two of his brothers are now training to go abroad with the second Australian contingent.
On Saturday the 12th we had an interesting fixture in the shape of Military Sports, in which the men cheerfully took part.   The results were very satisfactory, and served the dual purpose of exercising the men as well as cheering them.  On this day the more or less distressing order was received from head quarters the flag ship Orvieto, that telegrams or letters intended for transmission from Colombo should be left open for censorship and further that any
