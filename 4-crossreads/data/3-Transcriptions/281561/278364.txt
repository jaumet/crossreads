<p>2/2/17.<br/>Clear bright, frosty days, hot meals are sent to us at night but the stuff freezes before we can eat it. I have to massage my feet briskly at times to prevent Jack Frost from nipping them. Got some mail this evening, letters from the Lennon girls. Fritz has a new species of unpleasantness, a large rifle grenade we call a "pineapple". They burst beautifully when they strike this hard ground and the bird who is shooting them is most energetic. Will not go to the post tonight, have wangled a job as gas guard on Company Headquarters.<br/>3/2/17.<br/>The Hun artillery sang a hymn of Hate last night. One of his heavy batteries dropped it shells short, right onto the post of my genial Bosche acquaintances. They were badly strafed I am told. A shower</p>
