<p><u>Corpl Ragnell</u></p>
<p>I have had cause to pull him up 2 or 3 times, but very slight improvement has been shown. Is a good and painstaking musketry instructor</p>
<p><u>Lance Corporal Lang</u></p>
<p>Steady man. Is fitted only for small jobs. Liable to be sulky, when given orders by a senior N.C.O. I cannot recommend his promotion.</p>
<p><u>Lance Corporal Mitchell</u></p>
<p>Has a good knowledge of his work, and sees that his orders are carried out. With a little more experience, I would have no hesitation in recommending his promotion.</p>
<p><u>Lance Corpl. Chamberlain</u></p>
<p>Has only a fair knowledge of his work, he can control a small party, is a fine built man, but has no soldierly bearing. I think he will not be fitted for some time for any appointment higher than corporal</p>
<p><u>Private Flanagan</u></p>
<p>Most reliable &amp; steady man. Has a good knowledge of general work, and can handle men. He would make a good N.C.O.</p>
