Beach Thomas, war correspondent of the London "Daily Mail"  referring to the Australian Coup wrote:"  It seemed to me when I walked over it in 1917,after trekking half an hour to surmount wire, that Mount St Quentin was as nearly impossible to storm as a place could be" . Mr Perry Robinson " The Times"  correspondent at British Headquarters, issued this report: " The whole battle shows nothing smarter than the capture of Mount St Quentin, one of the strongest positions on the west front. The Australians, with a comparatively small force, won the position in a little more than two hours. The number of prisoners exceeded that of the attacking party" .
