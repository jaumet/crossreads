 Dear Mr Garling, Thank you ever so much for your kind reply to my letter also for your wishes regarding myself.  I have just bought a place at Drouin &ndash; hence my different address.  I have just received the enlargements mentioned to you by me, and it gives me sad joy in being able to send you some small token of Terence &ndash; his resting place.  I think the enlargement has come out very well. 
 Re the battle you enquired about on the 5th April.  The only name I heard given to it was "the Battle for Amiens".  Although all ranks who went through it called it the 5th April Battle &amp; that was sufficient. Please excuse brevity Mr Garling &ndash; having just moved I am very busy &amp; I do hope you will be pleased by the enclosures.  Thanking you again for your kind wishes &amp; thanks. Yours very sincerely 
 W Mossman
