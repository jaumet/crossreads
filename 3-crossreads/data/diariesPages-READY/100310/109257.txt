7/8/17 Campagne
Marched out as usual to training ground and did some company tactical exercises ? forming a defensive flank and a little wood scheme. General Paton was out and General Smythe was also close. Also did some close order drill c. The ground very soggy and peaty and the extensive view from here very enchanting. Harvest is under way and our chaps are helping the farmers with it. Some cases of fowl stealing occurred today. Lunched out on the ground and after lunch carried on with specialist work and sent A Coy for a route march. Immediately after getting back went to an Intelligence lecture at Wardrecques at which 3 of our officers were late. The Adjutant paraded them to me after dinner and I handed out the strafe. Held Orderly Room and gave some FP. Major Matthews returned from "W"area umpire job. Any amount of clerical work and interruptions taking place during the evening.
