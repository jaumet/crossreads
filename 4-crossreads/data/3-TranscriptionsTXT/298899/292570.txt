 for a long walk in the afternoon round the surrounding villages but could not find the unit I was looking for.  The night being a moonlight one both our own &amp; those of the Huns were out bombing.  Several bombs were dropped nearby, the antiaircraft guns &amp; all making a great din for about an hour. Monday 3rd. September.   General drill etc.  Moonlight night so taubes were over &amp; dropped bombs near by.  One hole left was 10 ft deep &amp; 30ft wide in the middle of a field.  The aircraft guns put up a tremendous effort with no result so far as we could see. Tuesday 4th. Sept.   Had the section out drilling in the morning &amp; introduced the O'Grady drill to make it more interesting.  Inspected Gas helmets in the afternoon.  More aircraft over at night.  Trying to learn French in my spare moments now and will try &amp; stick it out.
