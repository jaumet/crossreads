Monday 3A great battle is raging troops running to and fro. All night long I have been listening to the fierce bombardmentTuesday 4A glorious day with a lull on the battle front not a sound to be heard, excepting a tune "Dixie", from the bandWednesday 5Basking in the sun with a stook of hay for a pillow, my thoughts are good and my mind contentThursday 6They are fighting like hell, the big guns are roaring unceasingly "Ah" it is cruel.
