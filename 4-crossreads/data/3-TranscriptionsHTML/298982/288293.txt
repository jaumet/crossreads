<p>Vernon joined warned to keep low as our howitzer is to shell with lyddite in a few minutes</p>
<p>Mon 24th<br/>A wonderful quiet night which kept us all on the peep. I had several looks over our trench was made much shallower by removal of bags We gave them shots at times Early in the evening we used our Japanese bomb thrower which it appears does great damage &amp; goes up a great height &amp; then falls nearly vertical. Firing trench 9 &ndash; 1.30 The Armistice was on at 7. A great night</p>
