  
 June 29th Quite an exciting day.  Took my little lady to the Bazaar this afternoon in order to buy her some shoes & some material for dresses which the lady of the house promises to make up.  Spent about an hour in the bazaar in buying shoes, material & beads & was just making out when a mob of Persians with the Commissioner of Police at their head rushed along and surround me.  He gabbled off 60 to the minute about taking a Mohammadan woman thro a public bazaar.  I could see that things were thick so told him to come along to his office while we sent for the Interpreter who came along.  The position was that I have unwittingly  done an committed an awful crime in taking a woman of Persia (aged 12) thro the bazaar in broad daylight & bought presents
