However I eventually got into the saddle and bolted with the mob. The bullets were like hailstones something terrific. Saddles were emptied and horses going down One never knew when ones own turn would come I never lost my head I was too much occupied in trying to keep my horse on his feet.

German Taubes were flying over the Camp at Romani and Rail-head dropping bombs wholesale</p>
