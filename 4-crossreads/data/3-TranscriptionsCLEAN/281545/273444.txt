After my mate cleaned his Fire & took water we signed off at 11 am, & reported ourselves to the Orderly Sergeant where received a Chit for Two Blankets & a Waterproof sheet, my mate likewise also for meals.    As this is a new Depot in the formation everything is outside down we were allotted a Tent to sleep in having to lay on the ground it was not to comfortable.   A large number of German Prisoners were busy building huts for the engine men so in a few days all hands will be comfortable.   At meal times you go into a Large Tent with Table & Forms & an Orderly brings in the food & serves it out.   After a good Dinner of Stew Potatoes & Carrots & Rice, we both turned in at 1 Pm & I slept fairly well until 6 Pm, when I arose & went down to the Canal which runs along side of the Camp to have a wash.   This Canal will be very handy in the Summer for the boys to swim in.   After I had my tea I was notified to sign on at 8.45 Pm, & at that time we reported ourselves & I received a chit for 12 hours rations consisting of 1/2 loaf of Bread & a Tin of Bully Beef, also a note to proceed to Devies, where that was I did not know.   Another Engine was being prepared as a Banker for me & at 10 Pm we both left the Depot & stood out in the shunting yard for over 2 hours at the Train was not ready.  My mate & myself sat down & after a while we were both asleep & at Midnight
