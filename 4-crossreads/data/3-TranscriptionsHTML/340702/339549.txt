<p>Left Paris by Gare Du Nord at 1.15P.M. Outside Amiens we were delayed for quite a long time. Fritz Had blown up the line in front   <strike>by</strike> with Bombs an hour or two previously. In front of us &amp; delayed by the same cause were two Red Cross Trains containing men wounded in Fritzs great offensive. They were very pessimistic. Said he was in Roye &amp; that nothing was stopping him. The people are leaving Amiens in Thousands, the road are full of those pathetic pictures shown during the first German onrush. Women pushing Prams, Wheelbarrows, Etc.  Carrying children in their arms. Just like in the retreat from Mons. We got into the station late &amp; a mob of women &amp; children rushed the train. It was now bright moonlight &amp; we could hear several Gothas overhead flying very low. The machine Guns and Archies opened fire on them with as usual no result. The Station was their main Objective and Bombs (very heavy ones) were crashing all around us. Alongside of us on the next line was a Red Cross Train. Two Bombs dropped just on the other side of it abreast of us smashing the windows of the train with Concussion and filling the air with the acrid smell of the explosive. Shortly after our train moved out of the Station just as another salvo of Bombs dropped on our last possy. We went on a short distance, noting as we went, places where the previous bombs had blown in the side of the cutting. We again stopped in a deep cutting, trying to hide in the shadow of one side. while</p>
