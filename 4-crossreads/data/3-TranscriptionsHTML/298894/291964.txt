<p>&amp; was much appreciated fellows locking from all sides. Also had my first drink of Russian Vodka from the russian cruiser in port. Much like brandy but a more fruity flavour. This particular cruiser the "Askold" is known as the packet of Woodbines having five funnels.</p>
<p>26th Thursday Busy day &amp; felt off colour. In fact felt worse than I have done for months past but it passed off by night time. Rain threatening all day &amp; started in earnest about 8 o'clock at night, I then had to get out in the rain to loosen the Guy Ropes. Have heard Lord Dudley our late Governor has arrived to take up position of Camp Commandant. Having great trouble to obtain drugs, the depot treating us very scurvily &amp; our major is very loth to growl but I kept at him &amp; I fancy he will shortly complain.</p>
<p>27th Friday Very busy day. Went round the various wards to examine the medicines &amp; condemned a lot of old stuff etc. added to this 200 new cases in gave extra work. A piano having been presented to this unit, a concert is held practically every night but I do not get a chance to attend as my writing would have to go if I did &amp; I prefer to write home.</p>
