Friday 27th Oct.Very little doing in the station but we have been warned to be ready for 1800 cases within the next couple of days.  As only stretcher cases come here 'tis evidently going to be some push.  A heavy bombardment has been going on preparatory to it & the enemy also has been busy.  Today we had some cases in "gassed", from shell gas & some were serious.  It still rains on & off & the place is a perfect quagmire.
Tuesday 31st OctHad one fine day out of the last four so that the place is still swimming.  The stunt was postponed owing to the weather but rumour has it that it comes off tomorrow.  Things have been very quiet, very few cases coming in & the shelling has not been intense by any means.  This morning a few enemy shells landed just behind near a battery.  Sunday I went to "Maricourt" for drugs passing through "Albert"  which is much knocked about especially near the church whole areas being devastated.  A peculiar aspect of the church is the figure of the Virgin on the spire which has been hit & now hangs down as if going to fall.  French people say that it will fall the day peace is declared.  A shell might alter the prophecy however.  Had a puncture on the journey & ran to "Heilly" for repairs where the C.C.S.'s are, two splendid places with nurses.
