 January 1917 28th   I was put into Convalecent to-day which is a great relief after being in bed.  This afternoon I went for a walk into Albert which is only about a mile away.  I got a few interesting "snaps"  Albert is a fairly large town &amp; although there are very few french inhabitants left the place is full of troops &amp; very busy with motor transport. The ruined cathederal is the most interesting feature of the town.  Although once a fine building it is now a mass of ruins &amp; presents a very wierd spectacle.  Many of the buildings there are in ruins &amp; there is hardly a window in the whole town that is not broken.  Although the Germans still bombard it, the shells are few &amp; far between.
