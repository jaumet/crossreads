Dear Ted
Just a line hoping to find you all well leaving me getting better I think I will be getting up in a few days but it it will be a long time before I will be able to go back to the front. I sent you a Christmas card a week ago   &  suppose you would get it
Well Ted old boy would like to be over there for Christmas I have had five weeks in bed now I am pretty thin I think, I will ring off with best wishes   &  love to you Grace   &  Mavis from you Loving Brother CB
I have no mail from the front yet
