  Sun  Mon. May 14th During one of the Fritzs Barrages Stan Wright &amp; about 6 others failed to get through.  After waiting about 3 hours, we almost decided to go &amp; search for them, when they turned up.  It was a great relief to see them.  The 15th came &amp; relieved us about 7 oclock &amp; never was a body of men more welcome.  We arrived safely back at the A.C.S. in the sunken Road, where we found that instead of having a spell, we had to carry through to the Waggon loading Post. 
 There were a great many wounded coming through &amp; we were kept busy.  About 9 oclock, 4 g.s. waggons came along the Sunken Road &amp; commenced to unload Gas Cylinders.  Fritz was sending over a barrage of H.E &amp; shrapnel.  Over in the Gully, near the village of Noreuil our Batteries were banging away &amp; Fritz couldn't get 'em.  One of the Gas Waggons was standing just outside the A.C.S.  About 9 a shell landed right behind one of the Horses.  It didn't explode &amp; we all thought it was a dud; till somebody shouted out "Gas".  Then it was a rush to get our Gas Helmets on.  Maj Bond kept his head well.  There were a good number of wounded lying about &amp; these had to fixed up with Helmets.  The Heads reckon that about 5 thousand Gas shells came over during the night.
