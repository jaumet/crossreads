<p>FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine &amp; Sunny. Had early breakfast</p>
<p>and marched out of Sutton Veny at</p>
<p>8 AM. Got a special train from</p>
<p>Warminster at 9.30 and came</p>
<p>right alongside the &quot;Anchises&quot;</p>
<p>at Devonport at 2.30. Got a good</p>
<p>two berth cabin &amp; with any luck</p>
<p>will keep it to myself the whole</p>
<p>way over. My word its different</p>
<p>from the trip over.</p>
