<p>brought into this world somehow I feel that if I was to die tomorrow I have not lived in vain but have done my little bit to clear this world of the greatest monster of all times.  I expect we will fully appreciate our position when we begin to get closer to dear old Aussie &amp; our dreams are about to be realized.  I am sure that is what has kept most of us alive all through this awful war, the very thought that we would one day return to our native land &amp; get among our own people again.  I know it has kept me going many &amp; many a time when life has not seemed worth living &amp; everything hopeless, &amp; yet after all fighting is a most necessary evil in this old world.  I reckon nations go backwards without wars look at Spain for instance what a decadent nation she is, she wants a good hard struggle with a nation her own match to develop her manhood &amp;</p>
