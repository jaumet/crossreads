<p>Fine &amp; warm. But it came on to rain a bit in the evening. Out signalling all morning &amp; we were paid 30/- in afternoon. There was a lamp parade at night, but I did not know of it so missed it. I got a parcel (button &amp; Kangaroo) from Linda &amp; a couple of papers. Also a bulletin from Father. Warren came over &amp; he &amp; Jack &amp; Self went to the Vaudeville show in the evening.</p>
