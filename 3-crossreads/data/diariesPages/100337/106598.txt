Flaville. The day was bitterly cold & the wind cut right through our bodies. When we arrived we had to set too & build our own dugouts, during our building operations we were shelled by Fritz from time to time.

The following day saw no improvement in the weather, we had rain in torrents all day & the bitterly cold wind did not tend to make things any better. In the afternoon one of the enemys aroplanes came over & destroyed two more of our Observation balloons, the Ocupants reached the ground by means of the parachute without injury . Our Anti –Aircraft guns succeeded in bringing the enemy plane down. It seems very queer that on these two occasions in which we have lost balloons through enemy attack, Our own aeroplanes have been nowhere about, but on each occasion it was only a few minutes previous that out planes were to be seen every where you looked. Till the 9th of April fatigue duty was the rule, On Saturday we had heavy falls of rain & snow
