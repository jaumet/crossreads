<p>The work is well in hand, and looks magnificent.</p>
<p>9th May</p>
<p>Selecting negatives and arranging pictures with L.ieut Leist.</p>
<p>Leist has been for borne time assisting in producing the pictures whilst I was away in Palestin. Bought a bracelet from Stewart Dawson for Tony &pound;57.10</p>
<p>10th May</p>
<p>To Australia House where I now have office and with Leist arranging prints for the coming exhibition. The work is extremely tedious as I have such an abundance of subjects and find great difficulty in selection. Cold continues to incapacitate my voice which embarrasses me greatly.</p>
