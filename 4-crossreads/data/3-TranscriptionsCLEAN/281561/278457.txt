  
 was being called, just in time to get my ticket for the boat. I break into a cold sweat when I think of my narrow escape. We are off tomorrow morning. 12/3/18. Reveille 5 A.M. Entrained at Weymouth at 9 A.M. A 5 hour train journey to Plymouth through beautiful county all fresh with the green of early spring. The train went right into the docks, where we embarked on the Union Castle Liner "Kenilworth Castle". I have a good position on board. This is a splendid ship, 13,000 tons, carring passengers in the Saloon. There are many interesting sights in the docks here. Just alongside is the German Raider "Czar" which has just been captured. Nearby is the Hospital Ship "Austuria" which the Huns torpeoded. And the American steamer "Palma" that has been badly mawled by a "U" Boat.
