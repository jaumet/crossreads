22nd.  Left Harefield this morning for London & after a short run in the train arrived at Marylebone  here we caught the tube & went as far as Charing Cross, changed there & got out at St James from we had only a short way to walk to Horsferry Road   on arrival there we went through the usual lot of red tape before we finally drew our money & got off,  after clearing Horsferry I went round to Peel House & dumped my bag & overcoat had a meal & then struck out for Victoria, but I could not catch a train here for Eltham for I was going to see Mrs Oliver, so I had to take the tube again & get to Charing Cross, had to wait a while here so I walked off up the Strand & bought myself
