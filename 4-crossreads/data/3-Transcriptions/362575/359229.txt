<p>I have been told by our bank that we go out to India to releave men out there who have not been to the front.  So one should have rather a good time unless one suddenly finds meself in Mespots. [Mesopotamia ?] &amp; even that is a lot better than it used to be.</p>
<p>Met Libby &amp; Mrs. Hordern in the street some time ago, he was home on sick leave after a fairly long spell in France.</p>
<p>Heard from Kitty, she is engaged to some engineer chap &amp; seems rather happy about it as I don't think her home life was very exciting.</p>
<p>Will now close with best wishes to all.  Graham must be one of lads of the village by this time.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Stuart.</p>
