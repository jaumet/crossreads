 18 February 1918 Monday  Zachareyih  Am afraid there are many dead legends drifting slowly bye in the HOLY LAND- such impossible things are shown which our Saviour only made use of as parables-  The Cave here &amp; Zachareyih though are certainly wonderful places on the Summit of the Judean Hills. The men do not like the STEEL HELMETS, complaining of the weight-   I wear one &amp; must say, with a gas mask on at the same time, you would not recognize your son. As I scribble the howls of the jackals echo again in the Hills here, they live on corpses which they dig up.
