for a nice ride to Liberton 2 mile away passing some very nice Houses en route, built of Stone & not near so nice as the Aberdeen Houses, back again I came through the Principal Street of Edinburgh, Princess Street, & out to Murrayfield another 2 miles away, on returning I left the Car which are very slow & a long way behind the times, at the top of Princess St & took a stroll along the Wide Footpaths, this Street is recognised as the finest street in the United Kingdom, one side is the business Premises & the other is Gardens, with Monuments here & there. Edinburgh is built on 7 hills & very hilly, but very picturesque, it has only one main Street Princess St & the Gardens slope down until it reaches the Railway Lines, the Gardens are nicely laid out & kept, & then the Ground rises again where a large number of Large Flats are built, The Old Edinburgh Castle built in 626 by Edwin as a Northumbrian Fortress, stands up very high & is very large, & is supposed to be the Oldest building in Edinburgh, This place is a beautiful City & very large & has a population of about 1/2 a Million People.
