May 22ndThe "Anzac Coves" journey to "48 Squadron" R.F.C. and prepare hall & stage for the night - Oh what a change from London - A very old "unshapely shed is our new theatre. At 8.30 p.m. with our "English Programme", we open to a large audience of Australians. Pommies. Canadians & Americans. The show theatrically speaking is an absolute "riot". For first time I recite, "If" (by Kipling. After the show we are most kindly spoken to, by our Organiser & Officer, Major Churchill, who is leaving us in a couple of days.
