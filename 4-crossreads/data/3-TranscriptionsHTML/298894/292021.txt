<p><u>The Grousers</u><br/>Oh: we grouses w'en  we trudge<br/>Though a sticky stream of sludge,<br/>And we mustn't light a pipe without permission:<br/>And we 'as our little chunt<br/>Wen we 'as to sweat an grunt,<br/>With our pouches crammed with bloomin' ammunition<br/>Oh! We cusses till it's blue<br/>At the daily round of stew,<br/>With a special cuss to fit the cook wot sent it.<br/>But you precious soon will find Quite a different frame o' mind<br/>If we hears a fellow grouses as if 'e meant it.</p>
<p>We enjoys our little cuss<br/>When the major makes a fuss,<br/>An' we likes our playful grumble at the colonel.<br/>An' we grouses good an' 'ard<br/>When we 'as to go on guard,<br/>While inspection makes us chunder most infernal.<br/>But although we grouse an' swear<br/>W'en outsiders interfere,<br/>They are given the straight office to be keerful:<br/>They receive a big surprise<br/>W'en they start to sympathise &ndash;<br/>'cos it's just our funny way of bein' cheerful.</p>
<p>When we chunts with all our might<br/>You can bet that things is right<br/>An' there's nothing that's particularly riling.<br/>But w'en things is goin' bad<br/>And we should be raving mad</p>
