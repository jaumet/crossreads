 Nigs at Colombo getting a bad time with the potatoes &amp; onions which are stored on deck &ndash; if the boys are not allowed to land. 
 Tuesday 15/2/16 
 Very calm but heat most oppressive &amp; sickening. Most of the Boys are growing a Charley Chaplin moustache &amp; look very funny. Beyond a few fights on Board, nothing of any consequence to report. 
 Wednesday 16/2-16 
 Very sick in bed all day. Heavy cold &amp; Dengue &ndash; don't give a continental who wins the war. My temperature 100&deg; pulse 100. As calm as a river &amp; nice cool breeze blowing forard.
