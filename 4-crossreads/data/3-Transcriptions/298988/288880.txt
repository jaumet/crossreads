<p>May 12th  Fourteen Transport steamers left here (Gaba Tepe) this morning &amp; 6 tonight.  Do not know where they are bound for.  We are sending some letters down to Port Said with a water ship that is going there for supplies.  We got word at 6 p.m. to be ready to proceed at any time tonight.  It was a confidential report to the Master from the Admiralty as a precaution.  We understand that there are German submarines around in the Midetteranean or Aegaen Seas, hence we may have to get somewhere more safe.  The Queen Elizabeth just passed by &amp; she looked fine.  It was an amusing sight in some senses as she went by.  She looked a huge, powerful monster &amp; trailing about 200 yards astern of her was a small Destroyer which looked like a pup following its parent.  Everywhere she goes this Destroyer follows.</p>
<p>There is a terrific bombardment going on at Cape Helies now &amp; one can see shrapnel everywhere.  The pictures hung in my room are shaking the whole time &amp; we are six miles north of them.</p>
<p>Presume the Turks are getting driven down this way, so that our Troops can join up &amp; cut them off.  Got some English papers today dated April 18th &amp; nearly everything in it was new to us.  We were quite surprised to learn that the Heavy weight boxing Championship had returned to the white race.  We got a wireless through today about the capture of the Australian submarine A.E.2 in the Sea of Marmona, &amp; about a Turkish Army Corps that tried to advance under cover of a Warship &amp; were completely annihilated.  The audacity.</p>
