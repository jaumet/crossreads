<p>round giving concerts in "St Omer" instead of to the men in the field.<br/>Sunday 16th Sept.<br/>  Spent the day in packing up the remainder of our drugs &amp; going off to the Depot for a few odds &amp; ends.  Had a good drive on the old Ford.  At night had a final dinner at our late billet in the village as a send off.  The madame excelled herself in her cooking especially in preparing potatoes, specially mashed with egg etc &amp; baked in boiling fat.  Perfect.<br/>Monday 17th Sept.<br/>  Reveille 5.30, an early start in order to clean up camp.  Marched out at 9.30 passing through Wallen-cappell, St Sylvestre-cappell &amp; so on to "Steenvoorde" a very fair sized place, the march being about 9 miles &amp; very trying in parts as we  met roads with cobbles.  The whole division were on the road.  Reached Steenvoorde about 4 oclock tired but feeling well &amp; fit.  Had a wash &amp; clean up in a creek &amp; then after tea a few of us strolled back into</p>
