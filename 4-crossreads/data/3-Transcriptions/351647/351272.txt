<p>See how nicely &amp; causually I bring to your notice the fact I'm a Sergeant.  Of course it's only <u>acting</u> but I have the stripes &amp; the authority &amp; as soon as I know the ropes <u>all</u> the privileges also the title.  My really truly rank is Corporal but anyhow the pay is the same (net) as a Sergeant's &amp; I can't be a real Sergeant here.  But its near enough.  I'm really very fortunate to be here, my luck is wonderful &amp; hope I do all right but its tricky &amp; one never knows.  I shall have to walk warily &amp; not get dreaming.  I'd like you to see this country, of course its desolate &amp; heartbreaking but to see how it was</p>
