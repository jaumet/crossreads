<p>Saturday 11 September, 1915</p>
<p>Watches changed, have to do 18 hours on &amp; 18 hours off.</p>
<p>Heavy firing during night. It is reported that Hill 971 &amp; the railway have been captured. If that is so we may safely anticipate an early move from here.</p>
<p>Scored a tin of concentrated cream &amp; made some rice &amp; milk which was very acceptable, am looking forward to a repitition if I can get good with the Quartermaster Sgt who has a couple of cases.</p>
<p>It continues cold, especially at night. The artillery on both sides was very active during the afternoon, several shells landed on Courtneys.</p>
<p>We find our dugout a great blessing you get a bit of peace &amp; quietness.</p>
<p>One of our men, Gibson, has been sent to Lemnos suffering from Dysentry. This is the first man we have lost.</p>
