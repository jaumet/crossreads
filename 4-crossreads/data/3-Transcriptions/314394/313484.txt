<p>The failure of the heavy guns to prove satisfactory was most annoying but the same thing was experienced by the 47th Division who had relieved us on the BLUFF front and again in a few days time the firing of the gun was stopped from Headquarters.<br/> I made arrangement for another stunt straight away. The Battery Commanders had done very well and they soon managed to get up more ammunition with authorised help of the Infantry.<br/>Herewith a report on the second operation:-<br/>Battery X4A. In accordance with instructions received  Z4A Battery opened fire at 2 p.m. on the 10th inst.<br/>No 1 gun was unfortunate in having great trouble with the mechanisms and finally the gun blew out of the frame; the gun was in action only 45 minutes but during that time fired 50 rounds.<br/>No 1a gun was firing on the craters had even worse trouble, after 18 rounds had been fired the gun bed split down the center and the steel cRoss head blew out of the wood work.<br/>No 3 gun fired 101 rounds<br/>No 4 gun fired 100 rounds, the mechanism had to be changed on this gun also. A field clinometer was used with this gun. Great damage was done all along the line to enemy trenches and wire at 0.4.a.5.51/2, the enemy front line is breeched for 30 yards and the support line for 10 yards.<br/>The bombs fired from No 4 gun threw up timber, wire bags and etc. The damage was far in excess of the expectations of Lieut. ANDERSON the Battery commander.<br/>Enemy Artillery retaliation was very feeble except on the craters where he put over numerous whiz bangs. Enemy Mortar retaliation was heavy, particularly on ESTAMINET LANE and OLD KENT ROAD. ESTAMINATE LANE was blown by torpedoes for about 20 yards. Several enemy torpedoes air burst occurred. No casualties to personnel. The battery commander reports that his men worked in excellent fashion and hopes that they have carried off the championship from the other T.M. Batteries.<br/>No 1 gun numbered 186 Gnr Wookey N. 50 rounds<br/>No 1a gun numbered 723 Bdr Edwards V. 18 rounds<br/>No 2 gun numbered 4619 Gnr Smart J. 46 rounds<br/>No 3 gun numbered 1703 Gnr Davy C.J. 101 rounds<br/>No 4 gun numbered 4907 Gnr Wilson T.J. 100 rounds<br/>Average per gun 63 rounds</p>
