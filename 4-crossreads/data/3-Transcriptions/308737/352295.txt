<p>we are allowed to indulge in. You'll get a good few conflicting reports no doubt but dont believe anything till I write. That is to say rumours. I am sending you an old photo found of the Toowoomba crowd, taken just before we marched to the station. We are all mad with excitement you can imagine at getting away. I hope you are all well darlings &amp; the house is going strong <strike>When is Nance</strike> When are you going to become Mrs Claudiboy-Jones Nance? &ndash; you per-sty - ...kerpuss, - stopit!! &ndash;"nuffsaid". Anyway wish Claude good luck &amp; cheer-ohs from me only dont let him see this epistle. Well darlings I'll say cheer-oh &amp; God bless you all. Dont worry you'll hear from me again before we get into it. Best love sweethearts to you all.<br/>Your boy<br/>John Site-Pot</p>
<p>I am writing to Gran &amp; Jane now too.</p>
