 It is such a change to live in quietness, could not imagine such a war was going one, in the same country. The old Hun, did not get very near here, so no ruins -   &  the crops are fine. 
 Shall try and get my Xmas Cards off this week, so hope I won't forget any of them. 
 Dorothy was well when she last wrote. 
 I should love to get home for Xmas or New Year to see you all. 
 Fondest love   &  kisses to you all   &  hope you are well. 
 Give my love to my friends. 
 From Yours lovingly Edith
