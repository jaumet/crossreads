You will never be happy until  you get rid of it. You will have to try the bee sting on the arm & leg so that the bee poison will travel into your hands & feet.If ever I feel I want something tasty, I go to the Cafe right on the left hand of this Picture & have fried eggs or cutlets or Ice Cream. Nearly all Restaurants have a Piano. You can imagine the noise when all the Australians were here. Every Cafe used to be Packed & someone would be playing Choruses & the whole lot roaring out. Of course everything is dead now. The poor Pommies only draw 3/6 a week & they can't stand 2/- feeds on that. Try the bees.  Love Harry.
