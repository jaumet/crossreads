it was raging hot and burning sand to walk on. 3 of our men were left behind. Bricky Howard, and ?Pitt of A. Section in Hospital and Hugh Reid is still "missing" leaving Ismalia, we struck the desert once more and got a bit downhearted again, as we hoped to be camped near the canal. Instead of that we are stuck out here in striking desert, short of water and almost driven mad with flies even now we are not settled, but have to go out 8 miles further in the desert, where there is nothing but eternal sand. After dinner we pitched a few tents, then Major Williams took us down to the Canal, about a miles away for a swim, which we thoroughly enjoyed.
Thursday 30th
It seems as though our troubles are only just beginning. This morning we were looking forward to a decent feed of stew, but the cooks discovered there was kerosene in the water, so stew being "off" the menu, we had to fall back on bread and Jam. Just after breakfast a sand storm swept across and carried tents and everything before it. After it had passed we had to pitch our tenets again, and search for the things that had been blown away, and we are supposed to be "resting" to get over the effects of the march. Last night the mail came in I got 3 letters 1 from Mother and 3 from France. We have just got our kit bags back again, which we thought were gone for good. They are not sending any mail away from Egypt, so it is not much use writing, "Lizzie" Payne has just arrived full of news, so I'll have to knock off writing.
