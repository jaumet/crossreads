<p>him this evening so I having nothing to do gladly accepted so I tidied myself up &amp; off we went, his uncle turned out to be a parson &amp; not a bad sort of chap.  I thoroughly enjoyed my evening &amp; we had a jolly fine tea.  I had 3 big cutlets of salmon &amp; a piece of sole, 2 rissoles, jam tart, custard &amp; fruit, cakes bread &amp; butter &amp; a few odds &amp; ends, not a bad war time tea for a parson, they have a lovely home &amp; it was quite a pleasure to sit in a big easy chair &amp; yarn after scoffing a good meal like that.  We had lots of little arguments &amp; as usual drew all sorts of comparisons between England &amp; Australia, these were the first people I have met in England who prefer old Asquith to Llyod George &amp; we had quite a heated argument over the pair.</p>
<p>21st.  Another cussed boat roll was read out this morning &amp; I missed again so tonight I am not feeling particularly bright.</p>
