15/7/18LondonWalked down to Horseferry Road and there bought a few clothes but could not get a decent hat. Went to the Army & Navy Stores but could do no good there either. The day was muggy & oppressive. Was struck again by the whitened stone of the Abbey and of Whitehall. It gives these old places a most venerable look. To Piccadilly and had a shave and a haircut before going back to the Royal Automobile Club for a good lunch. Afternoon took 'bus out to Wandsworth and found the hospital rather empty. Saw Major Dooley who is off to Australia in a few days and also saw Southwell who was up. The V.A.D. girls here are fine capable and womanly girls. My trunk and suitcase here
