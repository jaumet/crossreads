<p>................for home, after he got us well lost he let us find our way to camp between then &amp; morning, so from when we left the trail till we reached the camp, we walked about ten mile. The morning found us at physical drill and we were all eager for night fall,&nbsp; to make up for the lost sleep during our leave. The next few days I was away from camp on guard duty at the hospital at Lovant</p>
<p>25th&nbsp; We had a rather exciting night, We were living 34 in a hut there and at 1100 that night half of the number came home much the worse of liquer, and brought some visitors from other huts in the same condition, and it was a battle scene before long. The hut sargent was the desperado of the crowd, He threw a form from one end of the hut to the other, at one fellow but luckily missed his mark, broke two ribs for one other, threw one on top of me in my bunk. They finally quitened down about midnight, but that was a common occurence in those big huts.</p>
<p>26th ?27th One oif the inmates was a supposed case of Meningitis. So the doctor made his appearance with his swabbing instruments. They kept us in contact for six days, but took us out after the parades had moved off and made us dig up the ground, between the huts for potato growing.</p>
