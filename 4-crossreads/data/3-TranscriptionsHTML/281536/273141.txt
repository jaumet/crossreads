<p>30/8/19 Chemnitz<br/>Out of sight of land today and having a quiet passage over the Bight. Fine and fairly smooth. Usual inspection &ndash; no complaints. Most of the officers play cards all day and concert at night where I made a speech of thanks to the concert party.</p>
<p>31/8/19 Sunday. Stayed in bed till midday. A lovely sunny afternoon. Read.</p>
<p>1/9/19 now 5/9 in a Tote on the day's run &ndash; 236 miles. It was raining this morning and most of the men were down below. Received message from Adelaide that we must arrive before 4 pm if our SA &amp; WA chaps are to disembark. The "Orsova" passed us during the day en route for the same port as ourselves. Capt. Young thinks we'll arrive before 4. The Chief Engineer (in grease overalls) reports his engines going better.</p>
