Examination showed that a fragment the size of sixpence had entered his chest in the right axilla and had tracked downwards & forwards to the left, through the pleural cavities finally emerging through a large ragged hole just below the apex of the heart.  In fact soon after the injury the apex of the heart could be seen emerging with each thrust.  A piece of the sixth rib had been carried away leaving a gaping wound.

The patient rallied considerably, but later on haemorrhage occurred, and he died two or three hours after operating.
