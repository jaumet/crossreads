Sunday 4thWent for a ride along the line & got my horse a good feed of barley        The country as one goes East improves splendidly, what with crops, orchards & green pastures.  An enemy plane came over & was heavily fired at.  It seemed to us as though it was hit but she turned straight back.  One of our planes was brought down in our lines and they fixed her up alright.
Monday 5thThe Brigade was out all day.  We hear the Turks are evacuating Shellal so the long promised big scrap will be postponed.  Posted letters to Arthur Blomfield & Aunt Carrie.
