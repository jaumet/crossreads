  
 as there are about 12 men to be paid & here this takes about 3 hours. 
 19-3-19 Have decided to go quiet this week in order to amass cash & have sworn off drink. Lecture to night on Rhodesia which was very interesting. Land abounds in parts & wild animals - land is good but little is agriculturally used cattle raising being the main industry. Fences do not exist. Land is freely given but somehow I dont fancy going there. In fact huge wealth is necessary to make wealth while the climate is not exactly nice for a white woman. 
 If farm fail you cant hire yourself to next neighbour for manual work is left to the blacks who are given a small piece of land in return for so much labour. 
 20-3-19 Thurs. Usual routine - went to town with Mansell. 
 21-3-19 Friday Usual school with a lecture in evening by Mansell on his air experiences.
