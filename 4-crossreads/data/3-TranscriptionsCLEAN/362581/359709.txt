My darling Eddy,
We have had a sample of hot weather to-day   &  now it is blowing hard - Hope we will soon get out of here, do not wish to spend another summer here. I am on night-duty   &  sleeping very well in the day-time. Tell Grandma I'm getting quite fat again   &  give her a big kiss   &  hug for me.  From Auntie Eadle
