<p>Dear Uncle</p>
<p>Very pleased to get your letter from Liverpool and all the news. We are back in the trenches again after a spell from them of about 5 weeks, we were put back into our own old position and the Turks gave us a very warm reception and some casualties resulted. I had better not say how many, big howitzer shells somewhere near 6 inch and weighing over 100 lbs have been lobbing everywhere on the position the whole time making life a very uncertain quantity, they are so erratic. 75s have been having a pot too, today I am Batt. orderly-sergeant and this morning have done nothing but walk trenches, so had a good idea of the damage done, at one time I saw shells going both ways, could see them quite plainly and in fact one landed within 15 yards and I can assure you it shakes ones nerves up some. I thank the Lord that my nerves are in fair order, some of the chaps who have had narrow escapes have entirely lost whatever nerve they had and fairly do their block if a shell comes over. Some very puzzling and mysterious things have been happening of late so we are on the watch for a big move, by the look of things we will be fair in the centre if there is a scrap. We are just getting a bit of our own back, big shells are falling every few seconds on the enemy trenches immediately in front, we can feel the concussions here.</p>
