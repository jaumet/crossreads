<p>Fremantle is a very busy town but dirty with narrow streets, boasting of a tramway system (electric) like the Pitt St system.  Perth is a few miles away by rail on Swan River which is much like Sydney Harbour in Places.  The city itself is small but fairly busy &amp; can boast of, in Kings Gardens, a beautiful playground.</p>
<p>Oct 14  That afternoon we left Fremantle &amp; watched Australian shores sink under the horizon &amp; a day or two after we entered then tropics.  The weather was fine but very hot most men sleeping on deck.  On 16th a concert was given for our benefit by the passengers &amp; on the 19th we crossed the Equator with usual ceremonies.  Oct 19 [in margin]  The ceremony is traditional in the British navy. "Neptune" comes on board &amp; after ridiculous carryings on as emptying each person who hasn't previously crossed into a bath, certifies as to his enrolment in the Log of Nep.</p>
<p>Oct 21  We were expected to reach Colombo on Oct 21st &amp; that morning I found the horizon dotted with black specks which on approach proved to be native boats or cadamarangs &amp; by 7 o'clock we passed through the breakwater into Colombo Harbour.  Colombo is a typical Indian city.  All boats anchored out from shore there being no wharves &amp; passengers are conveyed to shore by tenders.  The harbour swarms with small boats, motor &amp; otherwise, the police boat being very prominent.  No sooner the anchor was down than the boat becomes the centre of attraction.  Natives swarm over the side to offer their wares &amp; to exchange their money as curios for many more times their worth.  The coal barge comes alongside with a crew of dozens of natives &amp; hand loading with bags, soon have their cargo on board.  Then the merchandise, mostly tea comes on board in the same way.</p>
<p>The harbour is beautiful &amp; sheltered by a fine breakwater &amp; has for a land mark a huge lighthouse of high power.  The City is on the right &amp; to the left is a stretch of beach fringed with palm trees.  Off the beach is the wreck of the P &amp; O Steamer "Nubia" which ran aground.  The Town is fine, boasting of a tramway system &amp; some fine gardens.  Rickshaws are in great prominence &amp; are very cheap.  A very interesting journey is to the Cinnamon Gardens &amp; back through the Esplanade.  En route you pass through the native &amp; Malay quarters which are very filthy.  Of Mosques there are many &amp; a Banyan tree covering &frac14; acre is a good sight.  In the Gardens, Colombo Lake is the best sight &amp; beautiful it is when the shores are dotted with native women of high caste in gorgeous coloured silk gowns.</p>
