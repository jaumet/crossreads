and drove out to the Galle Face Hotel where we had Tiffin & what a meal it was after the sameness of the Kyarra dietary - no salmi of teal aux champignons, no boiled Dhu fish, but decent soup decent bread & butter, decent fish & a host of other decent things.   We had to rest on the verandah for quite a while after tiffin.  We then took rickshaws back to Colombo & to the railway station where I caught the 3.30 train for Kandy.   Grey was down for duty on the following day so could not make the trip to Kandy.   I went up in the train with Misses Carter Todhunter & King, the former's parents recently went up to Wahroonga to live they bought the house that the Littles were living in.   The train journey up to Kandy was very interesting, for the first two hours flat country is passed through, rice, bananas and coconuts are the principal things grown here.   It got dark as we started the ascent of the mountains so could see nothing of the beautiful country.   We arrived at Kandy at 8 PM & put up at the Queen's Hotel.   After a very sumptuous dinner we went for a two mile walk round the Lake which looked very pretty by night.   Saw numbers of fireflies.   The hotel is a very comfortable, the fine big lounge with plenty of easy chairs is one of the features of the place.
