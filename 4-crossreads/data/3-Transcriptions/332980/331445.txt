<p>&amp; going steady all of a sudden I found my self out again on to the Main line &amp; was not sorry as I had a very anxious time in &amp; out of this Depot, after making a good run, receiving all clear Signals everywhere I arrived back at St Omer at 3.30 am where I was relieved also my Mate &amp; Guard &amp; a new crew took the Engine over &amp; worked  the Train on to Hazebruick &amp; I signed off at 4 am.</p>
<p>Saturday 14th.<br/>I worked a shift on the Shunter at St Omer starting at 9.30 &amp; my Engine was relieved at 7 am after an easy night's work having a spell from 1 am to 5,   I brought my Engine into the Depot, &amp; had to wait my turn for Coal &amp; Water, I was kept waiting in my turn a long while, as they were very busy &amp; after grumbling to the Shed Foreman as I was tired &amp; hungry, he told me to leave my Engine at 9 am &amp; take another down to the Main Depot at Malhove, which I soon did &amp; eventually signed off at 10 am &amp; into Bed after a Meal</p>
