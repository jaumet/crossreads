that House & also in the other.  Well, Mum, I've to write to Marie to-night & it is getting on for time.  I have been relieved of one rotten job that I had & at the end of this month of another one.  I will be "Home and the Buick" as Dave used to say.

Best Love to you all, to Lily & Her Mother, The Miles & to Otto & Family.
Your Loving SonHarry
