<p>June 24th<br/>During the last day or two, apparently out of the void, has come upon us a plague of black crickets.<br/>We had them at Romani I remember about the same time last year. They are quite harmless, but are the devil of a nuisance, for they sing all day &amp; night in bursts, in season &amp; out of season. And one finds them swarming in boots, saddle &amp; blankets.<br/>This is roughly their appearance only a little larger [line drawing of a cricket]</p>
