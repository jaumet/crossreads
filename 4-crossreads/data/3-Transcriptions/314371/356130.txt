<p>Several of the officers are old friends of mine.  The village consists of a farmhouse &amp; a large heap of Bricks.</p>
<p>May 8th, Tuesday<br/>Started at 9 p.m. for the Front line.  After a strenuous march we reached our positions near Bullecourt.  Mine was with a Gun in a strong position, one of the forward positions on the Hindenburg Line.  Heavy shelling all night.</p>
<p>Wed. 9th<br/>Still in Trenches</p>
<p>Thur. 10th<br/>Still in Trenches</p>
<p>Friday 11th<br/>Fritz started shelling at 6 p.m. &amp; kept it up until 6 a.m. on 12th, in all, a 12 hour bombardment.<br/>The Huns evidently intended making an attack but our division (5th) took the job out of their hands, hopped over the top at 4 a.m., succeeded after 3 attempts to take trenches &amp; over 300 prisoners.  We stood by our gun all night despite the heavy shell fire &amp; only I got a crack on my tin hat.</p>
