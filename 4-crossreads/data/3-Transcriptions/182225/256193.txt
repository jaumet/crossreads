<p>1916 &nbsp; MONDAY 7 &nbsp; FEB.</p>
<p>Fine all day but rained at night. Took the horses out for exercise in morning, &amp; went for a 12 mile ride on them in afternoon on them. They are a pretty poor lot &amp; too light for artillary. I had a real good hack though. Horse picket in evening till 6 AM Tuesday morning. Its a better job than guard but not much of a job anyway. Wrote Linda in morning to say I could not get in at night.</p>
