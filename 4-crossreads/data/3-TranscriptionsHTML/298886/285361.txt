<p><u>DIARY</u></p>
<p>of Signalling Sergeant. W Peterson</p>
<p>Head Quarters 2nd LHR A.I.F.</p>
<p>From 1st to 13th of January 1916</p>
<p>During this period we were all bustle and excitement with fitting ourselves out with clothing and equipment which took some time plenty of articles not being in stock. Saddles had to be refitted. I had fondly imagined that we were in for a spell after being over on the Peninsular for over 7 months but that thought was soon dispelled however its war now the spell will come later I hope when the Big job is finished. On the morning of the 14th we packed up in full marching order and proceeded by road about 18 miles to the Barrage enroute for our new Camp. Arrived at Barrage about 5 pm. and Camped for the night</p>
<p>The Barrage is one of the places on the Nile where the water is damed up and made to flow through Great irrigation canals to various parts of the Delta. Each of these great Barrages has 61 lock gates with road way over the top very solidly built</p>
