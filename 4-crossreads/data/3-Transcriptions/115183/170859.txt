<p>(93)<br/>(Written 25/2/18 at Dead Horse Corner relay post in Ploegsteert Wood, Belgium)<br/>27 Sept 1917. We had an early reveille 5 am and breakfast 6 am. then resumed our trek at 6.30. I was one of those pushing a pair of stretcher wheels on which we put our gear instead of carrying it on our backs &ndash; an easier method except up hill, but much easier if you tie the wheels onto the back of a transport wagon unobserved.</p>
<p>Thus we passed through Ebblinghem on the Hazebrouck and Bailleu railway and Staple which village I had visited once before in my search for Will. Thus we were going by unimportant roads and therefore by roundabout ones. Cassell perched on its high lone line was in close view nearly all day. From Staple nearby which we halted for lunch we passed through Longue Croix and by a roundabout route to St Sylvestre Cappel with its tall spired church. From here  we marched down the main road to Bailleul for a short distance and then turned to our left taking the road to Eeecke [Eecke] here we halted and were fortunate in finding a NZ.
