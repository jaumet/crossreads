changing.We availed ourselves of this although we were disgusted that no train was running to Amesbury since we had carried out instructions and arrived at the rendavous very early.Arrived at Eastleigh at midnight and left at 1.30 arriving at Salisbury 2.30.After a considerable delay we found a garage and knocking up the people we were successful in coming to some arrangement.  Leaving Salisbury at 4.20 we simply flew along and I do not remember being in anything that covered the ground quicker.In swerving to avoid a rabbit the tire came completely away and it was only a miracle that the car was pulled up without mishap.He had another wheel and soon remedied the defect and we were in Camp at 5.A short sleep of half an hour and up again.
