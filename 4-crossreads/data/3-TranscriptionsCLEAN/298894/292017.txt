Sonny, it seems like twenty year,The while since you've been gone,And left me lonesome for you hereTrying to do my bit - oh ,dear! -By keeping steady on.
I promised and I've meant to do,But now and then at nightI've been to blame the time it blewLike guns that answered guns, with you -My you - amongst the fight.
But in the morning "Dear old fool"I've seemed to hear you say;"Mother, no need to fuss, keep cool,"Just like the Cheeky brat at schoolYou was the other day.
You wasn't always quite so grand;Once you was mighty glad,Chased by a puppy-dog, to standBehind your mummy, slip your handIn hers, the way you had.
Small son turned big, now that you're grownAnd in a real war,And set to face it all alone,I'm wild to run & guard my ownSame as I did before.
