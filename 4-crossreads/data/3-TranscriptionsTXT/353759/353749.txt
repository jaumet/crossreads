The gods hear mens hands before their eyesAnd heeds, before all light of sacrificeLight of things done, and noise of labouring men,Swinburne

SonnetsHow fever'd is the man, who cannot lookUpon his mortal days with temperate blood,Who vexes all the leaves of his life's book,And robs his fair name of its maidenhood;It is as if the rose should pluck herself,Or the ripe plum finger its misty bloom,As if a Naiad, like a middling elf,Should darken her pure grot with muddy gloom;But the rose leaves herself upon the briar,For winds to kiss, and grateful bees to feed,And the ripe plum still wears its dim attire;Why then should man, teasing the world for grace,Spoil his salvation for a fierce miscreed?1819, John Keats.
If I should die, think only this of me:That there's some corner of a foreign fieldThat is forever England.  There shall beIn that rich earth, a richer earth concealed;A dust whom England bore, shaped, made aware,Gave, once her flowers to love, her ways to roam.A body of England's, breathing English air,Washed by the rivers, blest by suns of home.And think this heart, all evil shed away,A pulse in the eternal mind, no lessGives somewhere back the thoughts by England givenHer sights and sounds:  dreams happy as her dayAnd laughter learnt of friends;  and gentlenessIn hearts at peace, under an English sky.1915, Rupert Brooke
But - There are wanderers in the middle mist, whoCry for shadows, clutch and cannot tellWhether they live at all, or loving whom:An old song's lady:  a fool in fancy dress,Or Phantoms:  or their own face in the gloomFor love of love, or from hearts loneliness,Pleasures not theirs nor pain.  They doubt and sighAnd do not love at all:  of these am I.Brooke
From memory.  All I have left of her than which I sent home, which I'm sorry for and knew when I did, I would be.  Maleish [?]
