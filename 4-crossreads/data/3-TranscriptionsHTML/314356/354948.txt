<p>Diary VIII<br/>1.<br/>December 18<br/>Solre le Chateau<br/>All the day grey rain blowing in mist past the cold shadow of the tower, and the square puddles of mud and wet-glinting cobbles, and in one corner, a huddled group of covered lorries.</p>

[Assistant Director of Medical Services]:  great debating over the latter shield, Ken objecting loudly to introduction of the Blue Lamp, but consoled by thought that its explanation could be an R.A.P. [Regimental Aid Post] lamp:  George's brilliant suggestion that a Bed pan schould take the place of M.I.D.</p>
