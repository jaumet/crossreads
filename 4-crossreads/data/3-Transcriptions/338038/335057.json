<p>No. 1 Section Div. Ammunition Column &ndash; A.I.F.<br/>Mena Camp<br/>Egypt 18th Jany 1915</p>
<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>I am very ashamed at having let so long a time pass without having written a line home but what with the irregular mail arrangements here, and with the very broken time we have at our disposal, I can assure you letter writing is very difficult. It is six weeks now since we landed in this country &amp; the weeks just seem to have gone like hours.<br/>I will try and give you an account of things in general during our sojourn here.<br/>After getting ourselves off the good old "Argyllshire" we repaired to a rest camp in Alexandria, to await our horses and vehicles from other ships. I put in four days altogether in Alexandria and was very glad to be out of it and on the train bound for Cairo, a distance of 120 miles. From Cairo we marched out to a place called Ma'adi where we went into camp with the 1st Brigade of Light Horse. The five weeks spent there were exceptionally agreeable. It is a delightful little town, 10 miles</p>
