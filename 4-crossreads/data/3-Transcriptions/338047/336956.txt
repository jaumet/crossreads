<p>1919<br/>March<br/>liberated from the Hun.  The officers managed to get dug in somewhere but I don't think that they are too comfortable.  (letter ends)<br/>The sanitary arrangements at the back of the house were of the crudest description.  Hessian was apparently not available &amp; the WC's were in full view from the street below &amp; also from several back yards.  Naturally we had been too long in France for this to disconcert us &amp; the madams from the adjoining houses used to bid good day to the men while there.<br/>The orderly room was put into the front room of Jules Charmanne, the local forester.  He had two very nice daughters Emilie &amp; Reine, who were a cut above the general run of French girls that we had met.  The day after we arrived, what was left of our four Battalions, being formed into one Battalion, 29th being A Coy, 30th B Coy 31st C Coy &amp; 32nd D Coy.  Faddy ran the orderly room for our Company, &amp; I ran the phone</p>
