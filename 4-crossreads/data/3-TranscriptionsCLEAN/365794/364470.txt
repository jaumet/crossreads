  
 Saturday 9th March 1917 [1918] Saw Matron re photo of grave she asked for & very delighted she is with it.  They recused late pass 2nd this week.  Went whist drive at Railway Institute & very weird was the drive down only with Mr. Shaw I felt safe, played 20 games with "all sorts & conditions of men" and found them well behaved & quiet - do not understand me I think playing with them as one sister, Hughes, refused to play cards in the ward, infradig. Home through curious back lanes & streets, places not to be through if alone but came with 2 nice people - 27th G.H. 11.45 p.m.
