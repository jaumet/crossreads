<p>affair. A change of occupation would do me the world of good.</p>
<p>April 14th. Sat.<br/>What a mixture, Snow Rain and sunshine.</p>
<p>April 15th. Sun.<br/>On duty all night again</p>
<p>April 17th. Tues.<br/>The "wee small hours of the morning again."</p>
<p>Good news from the Arras sector and also at the part where the British and French lines join, down in the Somme.</p>

<p>Walking out into the country this afternoon I saw a Frenchman trimming the hedges surrounding a farmhouse. He ingeniously avoided cutting the tall stems but instead he bent them across diagonally and intertwined them with the branches, this went to form a strong fence, and looks well when kept neat and trim.</p>
<p>April 25th. Wed.<br/>Anzac Day. Church Service was held in the convalescent ward. This occasion was also taken to celebrate a "Drunk Day". The men who celebrated this day most, were men who never had been on Anzac. Fools!</p>
<p>April 28th. Sat.</p>
