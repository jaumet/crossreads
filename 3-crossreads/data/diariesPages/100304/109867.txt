Up at 8.30 and after breakfast went to Cooks and booked for Trossachs, then walked up the hill to the Castle. An old guide, so Scotch you could hardly understand him , showed us round the place. Perched on its crag it dominates the city and its batteries of old guns must have been a good influence on the conduct of the town beneath. Mons Meg is a 20 inch gun and fired big stone balls or a hollow iron globe. Some N.Z. nurses were with us. The old chapel of St Margaret and the room where Argyll took his last sleep, the old banqueting hall the window from which James was lowered were all explained to us. Troops drilled doing goose step and ceremonial on the flat parade ground outside the main gate. Called in at St Giles Cathedral, a fine old place with much recent stained glass but many old, old things. Jenny Geddes threw her stool and Knox thundered here. Saw Knox's house in Canongate Street. To Surgeons museum and had a good look at some of their specimens. All the wets still here. After lunch via squalid old Canongate to Holyrood Palace and saw Mary Darnleys rooms with original beds connected by staircase. Good tapestries on walls. Saw the little supping room where Rizzio was murdered the brass plate denoting where his body was left. The old Abbey is ruined and adjoins. The vault of the Scotch kings was locked many stones denoted old graves. To the foot of Arthurs Seat and watched raw Tommies drill. No one allowed to the Seat for military reasons. Good view nevertheless
