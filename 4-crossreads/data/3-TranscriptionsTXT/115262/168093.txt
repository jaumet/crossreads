 Thursday 22 November 1917. 
 Went to Ramleh with 15 patients in sitting cacolets to Anzac Receiving Stn. which is in a  modern  building of modern architecture &amp; was formerly a church &amp; a hospital. 
 Had a look through the Monski. What struck me most was the ancient oil press &amp; Bedouin plough shop where Bedouin plows are made &amp; repaired by ancient methods. 
 Returned to bivouac at 4.30 pm. 
 Moved to new position on advance 5 miles further on the Ramleh-Jaffa road. 
 Reported to Bgde Hd Qrs as despatch for 24 hrs.
