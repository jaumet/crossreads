Jan 28th  Arrived at Etaples 9.A.M. where I got out had a wash & brush up & breakfast & walked up & saw Marion at the Hospital & as she was on duty she asked me to come back at 2.P.M. - I went to Paris Plage & met the sister of one of the boys of the section, as he asked me to look her up if I would be near where she was. I took her to dinner at Paris Plage & was sorry I have to say good bye so soon, but she had to get back to her place of duty & I had to go back to my sister. I met her & a friend of hers & the three of us went for a walk to a small village about five kilo's away & we had tea at a farm house (the village was Stella Plage) then we walked back to Paris Plage to the restaurant wh we had visited the last time I had seen my sister & we had a good supper & walked home with them & back to Etaples. by that time I was dog tired, having had no sleep much in the train & walking all day, & I tried to find a hotel or room to sleep but could'nt get in any place . at last I in desperation I went to the Y.M.C.A officers rest & got a bed for the night which I was very pleased to get into -
