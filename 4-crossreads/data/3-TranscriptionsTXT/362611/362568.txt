Re Total Abstainers Abatement &ndash; I can hardly sign declaration as upon one occasion recently I was induced to try a glass of light Danish Lager which was being taken by one of our men as a Tonic. I notice too in the Declaration that no provision is made for Stimulants ordered by Medical Adviser to.
I want to get this business letter safely out of the way in case there is a rush later for mail.
With much lolma
Your loving son,
J H L Waterhouse
P.S.
Under separate cover am forwarding per Registered Post 1 Pkt Photos &ndash; was much interested in them &ndash; my own from  Lau are being developed in Suva &ndash; some may be in time to forward this mail.
