I dont think we will be here long, I expect we will be taking part, in the push we read so much of in the papers but do not know for certain, This is one of the old fashioned French villages quiet and sleepy I should say at the best of times, Last night we marched through a fairly big town the place was practically in the darkness, and no one about at all I wonder where we will be next week. When you see Bea again give her my love and thank her for the Sox. They just got here at the right time, I still have a good pair that I brought over a couple of the heavy pairs I put in my black kit bag, I think that it is at the base in Eng. now and I gave Simmons a couple of pairs as I could not carry them, we can nearly always get a pair of sox if we require them, By the way a parcel, sent out to Summons from home had a handkerchief for me in it a lot of parcels have been posted to him but so far only a few have reached him. the Authorities must have a job to handle mails etc, the papers you send get here sometimes. I have not received one for some time now. Min sends them too, and sent me a copy of the S. Mail with an Account of Anzac Day doings in it but so far it has not reached me. now I must ring down the curtain much Love to all from your loving son C.G.P. All well so far no need to worry -
