<p>service to be held but the beautiful scenery of Marseilles is in sight - &amp; twill be lovely to be on land again.</p>
<p>31.6.15<br/>We landed or anchored at 3pm but the business of getting pass ports took us till 7 &amp; having to be back on board by 9.30pm we saw little &ndash; but next morning we were up &amp; away by 7 am having 4 hours.  Everything was most interesting &ndash; only we found our French diddent help us much.  The most notable place to see was the Church of Notre Dame de la Garde &ndash; which is built on one of the highest peaks &amp; where you get a beautiful <u>view</u> of Marseilles &amp; the surrounding Country.  I am sending most of you a picture of this &ndash; you will see at the top a statue of The Virgin &amp; child &ndash; which represents them guarding the Sailors of the Sea.  Saw also the Cathedral of Marseilles &ndash; a grand building.<br/>Marseilles is a busy port &ndash; numberless large boats along the wharfs which seemed to me to extend quite 2 Miles in length &amp; boats either side.  There were several troops marching in the streets.  Many of them Indians</p>
