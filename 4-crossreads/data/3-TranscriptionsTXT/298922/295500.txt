 Our new Commander in Chief is chief topic of conversation.  Tommy officers say &ndash; "Really rough sort of fellah" &ndash; you men should get on well with him!!   After we got home from last STUNT I asked Troop Leaders to give me a List of any deficiencies caused through crossing Barrage of Shell Fire, meaning such equipment as NOSEBAGS, SHOE CASES etc. likely to fall off saddle &ndash; one put in 4 pairs of PANTS!!! 1 pair of BOOTS!!! 
 Going Port Said tomorrow  on continued business &amp; pleasure for 3 days  so will post this with some snap shots.  My Table manners will be lacking I'm afraid &amp; I'll find the BED too soft.
