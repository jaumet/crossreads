I also have another box marked Farriers Tools, so when we land I will be running round looking for boxes

We passed Malta at 10 pm last night it looked well from the distance. Their Search lights were put onto us for a good while, I suppose many guns were trained in our direction.At the time of writing we are passing the Southern part of Sicily" on the Starboard Side Tunis on the port. Some time tonight we will change our course head across the Medit. for Marsailles passing Corsica Sardinia on our Starboard Side. We are without Escort now, but I expect there are Warboats within
