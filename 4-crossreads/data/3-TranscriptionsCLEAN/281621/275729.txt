Sunday 16Move from Senleques to Warrams. Snowing tonight & prospects of more tomorrow.
Monday 17A very cold night last night. Move today to Wizernes & there entrain, disentrain at Ballieul & thence to Danoutre, about ten kilos behind the line at Messines. The bombardment on the left, Ypres is fairly heavy
Tuesday 18Rumour has it that the Germans are going to make an attack on this front. Certainly the artillery is very active, day & night.
Thursday 20A very heavy hoar frost to-day & tonight & the hedges etc are covered with frost crystal. No rain & the ponds etc are frozen over
Friday 21Visit Ballieul again. The town is the same as of old. French customs are queer. To-day I saw a man carrying an empty coffin under one arm & the cross under the other. The effect of this hoar frost is just fairy like, beautiful.
Saturday 22Visit 9th Field Ambulance & have tea with Verne Cocks & quite a good yarn. En route passed through old haunts, Neuve Eglise & Steenwerck.  Still freezing
