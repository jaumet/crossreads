<p>24-3-19 (Mon)<br/>Instead of one of the lectures we had a demonstration &amp; a post mortem on a horse. At the killing of the horse Young who had seen bodies in all stages of decomposition &amp; mutilation in the Somme offensive had to go into the open air for fear of fainting. On same Mansell who flies at heights up to 15,000 feet in bombing raids could not mount steps about 50 ft high the other day because he began to feel &amp; had to come down.</p>
