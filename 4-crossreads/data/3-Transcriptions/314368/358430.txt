<p>been up there now ever since last September. A good sized town that you will easily find which is close to where I will be for the next few months is Ypres. Do you remember me telling you of a friend of mine, Reg Gilligan in Dubbo camp, well he went away some months ago, got to the O.T.C. in England , and came back as an officer a month or so ago. He is here at the school with me now that is why I can tell you all I am, for he censors my envelopes. I had a letter from Mrs Cust yesterday but she did not mention receiving a letter from you so I suppose it has not turned up yet. There are a few Yanks around here now, they seem decent fellows but of course we don't know what they can do yet.</p>
<p>I'll have to sign off now dear Ida, with fondest love to mother, father, Aub and yourself.<br/>Your Loving Bro.<br/>Gordon</p>
