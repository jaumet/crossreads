<p>have been well looked after by the Y.M.C.A.  They have provided us well with Tobacco, Cigarrettes, Biscuits, Chocolate.  Very hot here.</p>
<p>Oct. 4th<br/>Large numbers of Naval men here.  Numerous battleships in the bay.  Reminds one pretty much of Lemnos Harbour.  Up at four o'clock this morning.  Sailed over in barges to the fine big vessel "Ormonde".  It was well camouflaged with blue &amp; black.  I have not landed into very good quarters.  We are well down below the water line and there being no port holes, there is not much air getting in.<br/>Wherever one sees crowds of men to-gether and if there is any waiting to be down one finds them playing cards, games of house, pitch and toss.  These games of chance seem to have an intense fascination for men.  Means are provided on board for the change of our foreign money.  This is very convenient and very necessary.</p>
<p>Oct. 5th<br/>A big number of Hydroplanes flying about the Harbour.  A big number of young Tommy Officers came on board, said to be going to India.  Plenty of Fatigue work going about.  Officers and N.C.O.s full</p>
