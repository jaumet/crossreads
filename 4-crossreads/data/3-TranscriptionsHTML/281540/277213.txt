There are always olives and raisins.  This regularity I had not seen at school<br/>2 Sep 1915  In firing line are instruments for seeing closer without being seen.  I had hardly lifted instrument when bullet broke it.  This welcome not too pleasant.  I am careless of the dum dums bursting round me <br/>4 Sep  Bomb dropped from aeroplanes cause us great damage.

My ears are deafened, the ships ceased firing, with fixed bayonets we await enemys attack<br/>5 Sep  Our battalion will take over the trenches today. I say that our part was safer than the other because while on the right the  opposite trenches are almost touching each other, our distance is about 150 metres</p>
