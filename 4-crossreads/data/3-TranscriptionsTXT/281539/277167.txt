20/9/15   Before we left the boat for Anzac, every man was told put a few sticks under the straps of his pack as kindling wood was scarce in the trenches. One gentleman was heard to remark "It's bad enough going to hell, but it's a fair --- having to carry your own firewood!!"
At 2146 after receiving word that digging was going on in front near a row of black sandbags all the firing line "stood to" - ready and eager. And to the minute we put two rounds from each rifle into them and then down. We did not get one shot from them in reply which seemed to indicate unreadiness on their part and we probably caught a few Bed 2200.
21/9/15    Letter from D.R.Adams. Jack in Connells last time he was in there inquired after the "dark gent" and sent his regards. Such is fame!! Artillery bombardment after breakfast, stood watching shells burst. No sign of any splinters just a filmy white cloud first and then a few seconds after a reverberating crack. Went down firing line and had a look through the secret observation station. The German officers trenches marvellous, with barbed wire and so on quite impregnable. Back to H.Q - mail in. very ill all the afternoon and had to go to bed and stay there for 24 hours
