<p>from newly arrived troop trains were being embarked, the scene was one of great activity. After lunch started to  write a letter but was interrupted by the call for officers parade at which Capt. Evans, the O.C. troops read two staff communications, one referring  to submarine guards and the other about "Conduct in France" both of course being listened to with great attention. As soon as we were dismissed I scribbled a hurried note to Oll letting her know what our destination is to be and sent Davies my orderly, up town to post it.<br/> About 5o'clock we pulled out into the stream, but meantime it was amusing to watch several Egyptian craft hovering round the vessel with oranges, chocolates, cigarettes etc. for sale. They would come alongside throw up a cord to which was attached a basket; the order would then be given by the men for so many oranges etc. and on receiving them on deck they would lower their cash in payment; frequently to judge from the gestures and language I fear our boys forgot to put some of the money in the basket! Presently a water police boat with two "gyppies" in jack-tar uniform and red Fez's came along to hunt the traders away, but over and over again they came back. When we got out in the stream we got a better idea of the large amount of shipping in the Port which is made by a big breakwater perhaps &frac14; mile in length. We were up against the hospital ship   "Laetitia" for some time. After dinner spent time writing and turned in abt.10<br/>Thursday 30th March 1916<br/>A bright clear morning but later a squall carrying with it a little driving rain struck up. Nothing doing until abt. 9.30 in the morning when our companion troopship the "Corsican" weighed anchor and headed out of the channel, the entrance to which we afterwards found was mined. With the glasses we could see that she was presently joined by a light cruiser to keep her company. About 10 o'clock while I was holding a muster parade to definitely see whom we had on board we weighed anchor and started to move out down the channel and into the Mediterranean; it was hard to believe it. The water was very blue and there was no smell of "niggers" such as we had been accustomed to for some time. A fresh breeze tempered the heat. We followed in the wake of the "Corsican" and her consort, all the time zig-zagging in our course. Further protection was afforded by 2 trawlers keeping about 2 miles abeam while in front of us I believe a mosquito-like destroyer led the way, tho I personally could not see it.<br/>All day long life-belts are worn by all ranks, excepting at meals when it is allowable to take them off. A parade was held in the afternoon but it was not possible to do much work. Scarcely any motion at all but no room for movement. After dark all lights that were exposed were not lighted and all port holes, windows et. obscured with brown paper or other arrangement. Writing after tea and turned in abt. 10.<br/>Friday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31st March 1916<br/>A bright sunny day with a fairly stiff N wind blowing but with very little motion of the vessel. At daylight we were still heading N and high land which we were told was the E end of Crete was showing on the port side. Our escorting light cruiser, the "Campanula" was standing by on the port side and away on the horizon on the other beam were the 2 trawlers. During the morning a business-like little destroyer ( the "Rattlesnake") tore up to abt.100 yds.of us,</p>
