 22/8/18 Vecquemont A hot boiling day. The 3rd Division attacked up front somewhere and the 1st Division go through them in the morning. The rumour is that we go in on the 25th. The Battalion paraded at 9.30 a.m. under surrounding green trees  and did Lewis gun and other work. Mills with his staff and a limber went  all through the lines and collared blankets and equipment galore. Our new reinforcements are settling down and should prove to be good men. They came via Panama Canal and U.S.A. Walked around and yarned to a lot of our old sergeants &amp; others. The ground down near the river here is peaty and shakes when a horse is ridden
