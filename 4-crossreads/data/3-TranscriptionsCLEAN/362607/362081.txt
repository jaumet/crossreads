 Dear Mum, This is the Quay of Le Havre & the Museum which I intend to go through when I get the chance. The Museum is the big place on the left. The rue de Paris, one of the best Streets in town for Business begins here & runs away up into the City. The building on the Harbour front & right up to the electric light structure are without one exception Cafes. Smelly places they are to. Gee if one could only go to a place that did not stink of food. Fortunately we have good meals here & no one has no need to consort to any Cafe.  Kindest Regards to all the Friends & Neighbours.  Love Harry.
