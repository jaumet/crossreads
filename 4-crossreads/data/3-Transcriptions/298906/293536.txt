<p>I am right as rain.<br/>9th. Here we are at 3.30. A.M. &amp; lying just outside the boom at Southampton waiting for the port to open so as we can get in, was rather surprised to find that I stood the little trip well, have not felt the slightest bit sick, the ship was crowded &amp; I slept on a sort of counter which had been overlooked in the crush.<br/>Landed at 7. &amp; struck off for the town to get some breakfast, got in to a restaurant, &amp; had the following a minute piece of bread, &amp; still smaller ration of butter, cup of coffee, fillet of plaice, small piece of steak &amp; chips, we got the shock of our lives when they made the bill up, 4/- each, well you could have knocked me down</p>
