<p>The life of Paris is proceeding with normal calm, undisturbed so far as regards the bulk of the population.  The pop. of the capital incl. outlying suburbs is now about five million.  In view of the proximity of the enemy (39 miles) large numbers of the inhabitants are being sent into the interior and quantities of art treasures removed.  Everything, as regards theatres, restaurants, cafes, shops, etc. is still going strong.<br/>Amiens which is distant now from the enemy lines about 9 miles, is suffering a grievous martyrdom.  It is estimated that about 10,000 shells have been thrown into the town since the shelling began.  The damage is incalculable.  One house in every 27 has been hit and one in every 7 demolished.  The Cathedral has been struck for the seventh time.  St. Omer, Boulogne &amp; Abbeville are being heavily bombed.</p>
