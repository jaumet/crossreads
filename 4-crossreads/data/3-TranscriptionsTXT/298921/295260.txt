October, 1915Saturday 16Went Cairo to get some gold & sundry Kit ready for my second Marching out - I wonder what will be in store this time!!!Going to dinner with Mardi & Miss Cook tonight at their Pension Heliopolis She gave me a book 2 Kharki handkerchiefs & a Pipe from Aunt Louie & Kathleen. Please thank them in case I cannot write as I am very busy now but hope to do so ere I leave, am taking plenty of paper & envelopes - My job in Camp has been to open dead men's letters & re-address them to senders or destroy if advisable, a pathetic job - people should sign in full.
