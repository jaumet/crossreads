 The fireworks display contains fire portraits of King & Queen & beautiful rocket displays but cannot equal the display on the other side of the channel. Then English display cost 20,000 the other must has cost 100,000 or more 
 As room is not certain to night & stretcher is all I can expect I do not go home but try RAC & am advised to go to Savoy Baths which I do. This is really a Turkish Baths but the cubicles used to recline on are used for sleeping apartments by night, a cooker is kept on premises & breakfast can be obtained so it is as good as an hotel. 
 My word I have slept in some queer places since leaving Aussie. 
 20-7-19 Leaving Baths at 12 30, I do not know what to do & decide to visit Madelins friend Miss Gallagher &
