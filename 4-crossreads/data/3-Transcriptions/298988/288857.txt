<p>April 27th (Tuesday)<br/>The bombardment went on intermittently all last night, increasing in violence at daylight this morning.  The French Troops that landed in Asia Minor, off Tenedos Island are forcing their way across the plain of Troy.</p>
<p>I can just imagine how the outside world must be watching with eagerness these operations.  I daresay too, that they know more of it than we do here.  Have been speculating how long we will be here.  Perhaps they may send us away with a batch of Turkish prisoners, after we get the rest of our Troops landed.
