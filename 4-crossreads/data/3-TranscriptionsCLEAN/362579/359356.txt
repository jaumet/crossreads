 My dearest Mother   &  Sisters, 
 Had another move to-day, much to our surprise. Awakened at noon   &  told to be ready at 2.30 p.m. to go to another C.C.S. at Ficheux, so one's life is never certain. We are fearfully disappointed because the other sisters of our C.C.S. left to join the Unit in Belgium   &  we were promised but maybe sent for in a few days.
