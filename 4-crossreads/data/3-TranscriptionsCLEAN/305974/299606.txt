  
 24 Monday A very hot day.  Sea rather calm.  Sports held on promenade deck in afternoon & Boxing at night.  Wrote P.Cs to Olive Turner, Mrs Blackwood & Florrie Whitehead.  The next thing to look forward to is Egypt & going through the Red Sea.  A good few games introduced in the sports, handsome prizes are given to the winners, such as an apple or a chocolate, etc. 
 25 Tuesday Sea very calm.  Rather a   very  hot day with westerly wind blowing.  Passed Minnaco [Minicoy] Island about 9.30 am.  Boxing arranged for but no pugilists turned up & was therefore cancelled concert held on promenade deck in evening.  The O.C. seemed very annoyed at the non-attendance of the "pugs" 
 26 Wednesday Got Films from Dispensary.  Wrote letters to George Owens, George Handley & Jim Griffiths.  Sports held on promenade deck in the afternoon.  A very nice day.  Sea very calm.  The ship seems very slow & can only do on an average about 9 knots an hour.  Every day there is a guard put on to guard the gang ways etc, also fatigues.  I have been fortunate as I seem to miss all these.  Each state takes it in turn.
