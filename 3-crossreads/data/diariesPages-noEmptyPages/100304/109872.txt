Oban. Passing out of the Kyles we glimpsed the open sea around Arran and then continued our course via Turbert to Ardrishaig. Land on either side all the way. Got a motor at Ardrishaig and motored from there to Oban. Very good roads past crag, fell torrent and a lot of our 6 hour drive was taken up in the windings. The scenery was splendid, such shades of green and brown. In places the country is most barren and precipitous in others soft and well suited to the arts of husbandry. The lochs always have an impressive background of mountain. Reached Oban about 6.30 and put up at the Caledonian Hotel. The town seems to be a favourite tourist resort, of course this is the tourist season. Apparently most of the local folk are seafarers. The air is very cold which is rather unusual they say for this time of the year. Tired and have a rotten cold in the head the result of the trip down the Clyde two days ago. The sun set in a golden flame behind the Isle of Mull. At dinner the thought struck me, how tired waiters must get of the sight of food and ministering to the selfish gourmandising mountains of gut you encounter so often.
