<p>around. One can hardly realise being right in this ancient France the scenes of all great battles &amp; especially Rouen, one of the oldest &amp; most famous of all towns, birthplace &amp;  death place of Joan of Arc. I look around the hills &amp; conclude it is really a pretty town, the very old buildings, cobbled streets, street-cafes, ancient inns &amp; courtyards    &amp; the great old romantic Cathedral, so conspicuous, of marvellously fine    &amp; beautiful architecture, built in the 14th Century. Take  a tram to Bonsecours, a long walk to the farms &amp; woods, seeing many nice residences en route typically French</p>
<p>A great view of the town from this hill. At 8 pm down comes the rain in torrents. Hasten home, have a long talk to Madame &amp; her daughter, teaching them a few words in English &amp; to bed</p>
<p>27th August:- Sunday<br/>After work until 12-30 pm</p>
