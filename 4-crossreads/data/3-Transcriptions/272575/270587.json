Soldiers civilians and various small boys who were out to get as much as possible boxes of cigars etc were taken and cigars were handed round amongst the crowd, some of the windows broken would not have been touched had it not been for civilians egging the men on,   One was a civilian wanted me to get some of the boys together and start operations on a butchery business then he said that once we had started the crowd would be able to join in, of course he did not say that the civilians would share the blame, but that did not matter much.   Perth is rather a nice town far better than Freemantle,   I did not manage to see Mary B.   Northam is about 72 miles from Perth and [indecipherable] is 20 miles from Northam, so I did not go up as I was short of funds,    I visited the Musuem &amp; Art Gallery in Perth, they do not compare with Sydney &ndash; at all.    we sighted the first land today   must stop now. with love to All heaps for Yourself &amp; Bet. from Your Loving Son C.G.P.</p>
<p>Wish J. Many Happy Returns of 16th &ndash;The same of [indecipherable] or Me.</p>
