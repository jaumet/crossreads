<p>"Parramatta"<br/>per S.S.Murex<br/>Dear Guy,<br/>Just a line: a signal has just informed Fleet in general that too much news has been sent in letters. ergo: I presume some or all letters are being opened and so shall withhold those I&acute;ve written you as they are not at all in accord with that one of the "Laws of the Navy" which says:- "Take heed what ye say of your rulers Be your words spoken softly or plain Lest a bird of the air tell the matter And so ye shall hear it again."<br/>I don&acute;t think I have given away any valuable information tho&acute; as a blind German could see that half our commanding Officers are a pack of old hens. I wonder if you got mine from Port Moresby? Our policy seems to be one of careful avoidance of any hostile ships, as I heard one of "Yarra&acute;s" matelots say of Pateys strategy: "&acute;Strewth! hes tryin* to kill &acute;em by kindness!" Can't tell you of our doings or prospective doings. As "Nil" would nearly meet the occassion you don&acute;t miss much. Love to all, very glad to get your letter &amp; Nell&acute;s by "Grantala" Send us more when you can<br/>Yrs<br/>A.B.D.<br/>The funny flagship tells us "to stamp our letters with N.S.W. stamps" fear I can't, hope you don&acute;t mind; we have no factory for &acute;em here. Wish I were going with Force to France, might get something to do, am sick of these funny play acting stunts up here."<br/>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oct 15th 1914</p>
