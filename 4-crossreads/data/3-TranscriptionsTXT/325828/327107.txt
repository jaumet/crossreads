 Naturally I was awfully pleased that you were not averse to my "engagement news".  Elsie informed me, after I had told her the result of your letter, that had you been in the slightest way against the engagement she would have broken it off "tout de suite" hard &amp; difficult though such an action would have been. However everything is quite O.K. &amp; we are very, very happy in each other's love.  I thank you for your various hints &amp; will do well to keep them before me.  Now about monetary matters I sha'nt cable for any more money, in fact as soon as I get my commission I intend to increase my allotment to 10/- per day.  With 3/- p. d. deferred this will still allow me 8/- p. d. to draw which should be sufficient In my pay book I have made out a Military Will, dated 3.9.1918 leaving everything I possess at the time of my death to Elsie, and have added a rider to the effect that should I meet my death whilst in England, it is my last wish that I should be buried in Shrewsbury Cemetery, Shropshire, where my grave would be well looked after by the Lawsons.  It is not altogether a choice subject to debate, but at the game I am at now, much may happen in 10 minutes, &amp; it would be too late after a fatal crash.
