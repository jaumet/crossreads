Having purchased each a Ticket we went along the platform & joined our Train & soon was speeding on our way & in due course arrived at East Croydon & there had to change into another Train which duly arrived & off again until we arrived at Brighton, the Weather here was a lot brighter & not nearly so cold. After joining another Train was soon off again to Barnham Junction through some very nice country, gardens everywhere & Nurseries. We had to change again into the Bordon Train this making the 7th Change of Trains in a run of about 100 miles I was just about full of changing & was glad to arrive at Bognor,.
