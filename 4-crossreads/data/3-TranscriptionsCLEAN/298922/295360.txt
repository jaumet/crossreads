  
 Saturday 3 February 1917 
 Another mine washed up on the Beach, it looks like a big 3 legged POT turned upside down - the legs are the percussion caps to be touched by boats & then exploded - A machine gun was played on this & up it went. 
 Nearly full moon & at 12.30 I turned out ranks just as a Plane flew over but no bombs were dropped - It gets on the nerves of some of the troops & they cannot sleep, personally I worry not KISMET.
