 My dear Father Since writing from Epsom I have been moved twice - The first time to the Australian Hospital at Hanfield which was the worst place I have been in and from there to this beautiful place right on the banks of the Thames. I have been examined by one of the first eye specialists in England and he decided to operate. The operation takes place this afternoon and I have another one in a weeks time - He says I'll be able to pass the eye test when he is finished will me - J and R visited me here when they got back from Penlee - they look simply magnificent both of them and are far the charmingest girls I have ever met - The Commanding officer
