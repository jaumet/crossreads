The railway station was fair size.  Saw many of 1st Div Pioneers who were quartered in the town & also the British Butterfly Div (19th)   Rather a pleasant surprise came when we saw a lion cub in a garden attached to the Divnl H.Q. and later on when we witnessed a tennis match by girls from the local convent.  Later we saw the train from Boulogne arrive and was pleased to see some English YMCA girls on board & they sent some papers over for us.  Then we caught the midnight railway back to Ouve. 
 Saturday 25th We received orders to move again today from this area (11th Brigade) into that occupied by 9th Brigade.  Our billets allotted at a small village called Eseque [?] near Thembrionne  [Thiembronne] which was about 5 kilos from Faughemberghes [Faquembergues] on the midget railway.  Major Williams had our packs forwarded by car & therefore the march - tho it was hot - was a pleasant one - the boys whistling the while.  On arrival we found the billets rather scattered and B Section had to walk perhaps 600 yds to meals & parade.
