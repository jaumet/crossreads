 My darling Eddy, 
 Your birthday, Xmas   &  New Year's have passed.  I hope you had a very happy time   &  lots of presents. You will be enjoying warm weather   &  we are having     a  very cold time now. It was very pretty at Xmas, the white frozen snow   &  a little sunshine, now it is dull   &  raining. Hope to sail in a few weeks. Fondest love   &  kisses. From Auntie Eadle.  OXOXOXOXO
