Anzac20/12/15filthy condition very different to our usual spotless cleanliness. Word came by phone that I was to leave 5 minutes before Pedler. I wont forget the excitement of this time, the trenches deserted except for an occasional sniper pottering away in an absolutely isolated position, Sketch "A" Co particularly walked up and down and from "B" Co down to B8 there was not a soul. A daring enemy scout had only to put his head over and look round and we were done for.
It was cold and a bright moonlight the rifle and machine guns reports cracking sharp. Biscuits bully beef and other stuff lay everywhere and I carried a small miners pickaxe and carefully punctured any tins I passed so the contents would be useless. Flare oil was running to waste, waterproof sheets slashed to pieces and rubbish & blankets lying deep on trench floors. It was a remarkable sight. Time seemed to drag and we kept looking at our watches, the excitement caused excessive secretions and the rear trenches and dugouts were systematically fouled, the need for the observance of the rules of sanitation being passed. Hostile sniping was fairly heavy.
At 0235 I was due to go but stayed laughing with Pedler at the splendid joke we were putting up on Abdul over a bottle of stout so we left together the last Australians out of Johnstons Jolly. We formed up near Dressing Station and on road respectively and then set off down valley. All our trenches were now empty & Abdul had only to come over to take them. There was now complete silence from the whole of the Anzac position except for the straggling reports of a few fuzed and timed rifles we had rigged up with cord weights &c so they would automatically fire some minutes after we had cleared out. The enemy continued to plaster the trenches with the usual hail of bullets. We went straight down by road to the Lower Banks.
