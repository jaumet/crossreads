<p>Sunday<br/>27/2/16</p>
<p>Very Cool &ndash; a Bit Rough. It was so quiet you would never dream that over 1500 men are on board.<br/>A passing Cruiser at night honoured us with her flashlights. Very pretty looking over the railing at phosphorous &ndash; in great quantitys tonight. I notice a lot of stars that I have never seen before &amp; much more brilliant than most of ours. The Southern Cross has disappeared to view.</p>

<p>Rather warm &ndash; a lot calmer &ndash; Passed several large Boats.<br/>Passed Socotra Islands in the forenoon &ndash; Very high &amp; barren. I don't think they are inhabited.</p>
