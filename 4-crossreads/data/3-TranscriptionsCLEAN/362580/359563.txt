 My dear old Alice, 
 Well, I've been discharged this morning, but have to come down every morning to have my abscesses dressed, then most likely go to Alexandria for a week, I have had three wretched abscesses - the last two were opened last Saturday, hope to goodness I shall not get anymore. 
 I received Ethel's very newsy letter on Friday, you are all very good writing so often to me.  I just love little Eddy's letters & can always read them. 
 Col Maudsley leaves us to-day, he came down early this morning & was so pleased to find me well.  I shall have to come here for my meals for awhile, have to be on special diet.  Essie Craig is much better walking about a bit & will soon be coming upstairs to sleep.  I had a very sad letter from Mrs. & Mr. Osburne telling me of poor old Laing's illness.  I feel so
