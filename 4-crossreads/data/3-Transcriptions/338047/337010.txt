<p>1919<br/>Apl 28<br/>[Sketch of lorry]<br/>A lorry similar to those that we travelled in.  Our view was a back view.</p>
<p>We had no tucker with us, but got tea there. Those that had cash (not me, I was poor &amp; penniless after the Paris trip) bought biscuits &amp; chocolate.  We then re-embarked &amp; proceeded on our journey.  The river was much broader now, I should say 150 yards across.  Steep hills bordered it on both sides.  All means of communication seemed to go in the valley &ndash; the river, railway line, road, tow path &amp; telegraph line, all running along together.   There were fine houses at intervals on the hillsides.  At last we reached Dinant, crossing over the river by the bridge.  The Huns behaved particularly badly here.  They systematically burnt out part of the town by setting fire to about 600 houses with petrol &amp; also lined up 650 of the men, young &amp; old, against the church &amp; shot them down.  The fort was on the cliff</p>
