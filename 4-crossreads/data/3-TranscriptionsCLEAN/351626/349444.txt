  
 perhaps you did not get all my letters.  The wound was in the calf of my leg   & was only serious in that it cut all the muscles   & caused foot-drop which took some five months to get alright, but was not dangerous. 
 I will let you know as soon as possible my next move after my furlough is finished. with love   & best wishes to all I am Your affectionate Son Charlie
