 Dear Mrs. Jack, 
 Your letter No. 4 of Boxing Day reached me last night and I was very grieved to hear of your Father's death.  Of course he was not too good when we left & Miss Hilda told he has was having a very bad time so I can understand in a way that he was glad to go & that you all feel relieved to think his suffering is ended.  It is terrible to watch people one loves suffer &  not  to be unable to relieve them. 
 Still it is a terrible loss & I know how you will feel it & I am so sorry & wish I could do anything at all.  But I can't & by the time this reaches you
