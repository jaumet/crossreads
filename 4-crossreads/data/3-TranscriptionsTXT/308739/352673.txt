 Sunday 12 March 1916 Col. Fuller &amp;amp; Major White left for Port Said with Col. Onslow to visit the surrounding sights. I left for Cairo by same train arriving 2 p.m.  Stayed at new Khedival Hotel, paid 25 PT. for Bed, Breakfast &amp;amp; Hot Bath. Went this Evening to Maadi to see "Said" re assisting to Buy Mess Stuff. 
 Monday 13 March 1916 Met "Said" at Shepards Hotel at 8-30 a.m.  Drove about the City with Him buying up Officers Mess Stuff.  Went to Anglo Egyptian Bank &amp;amp; placed to Col. Fuller's Private account &amp;pound;60. Left by 6-15 p.m. Train for Serapeum, arrived at 10-30 p.m. Limber waggon at Station to meet me. Said has a fine equipment in the shape of a Garry beautifully Finished off &amp;amp; a Horse of the Arab Breed.  The turnout would cost at least &amp;pound;150. 
 Tuesday 14 March 1916 Regimental Parade &amp;amp; swimming is the order of to-day. Lieu. Cunningham of Post Office, Alexandria is now Capt. &amp;amp; is stationed at Cairo.  The postal work for Light Horse Men is now principally done at Port Tewfic on Suez Canal entrance.  The mail is taken direct off the mail Boats &amp;amp; sorted in a large Stone Building specially erected for the purpose, &amp;amp; then sent on to the different camps. 
 Wednesday 15 March 1916 Reg. Parade today.  Swimming parties are formed under an Officer to proceed to Canal for Swimming.  The men thoroughly enjoy the outing.  Artists in the Regiments arrange the Name &amp;amp; place of the Brigade, with Stones &amp;amp; Sand on the Banks of Canal so all &amp;amp; sundry can distinguish the country we spring from.  There is very little currants in Canal which is strange, as two Great Oceans connect.
