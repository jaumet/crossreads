<p>I&#39;m told that the Authorities are cutting out soldiers&#39; parcels, after the Christmas ones. &nbsp;Although the Lads will feel it generally, perhaps there are a few in particular who&nbsp;will feel it most, I&#39;m sure.</p>
<p>Well, Dad, this is Thursday, I&#39;ll keep it and it will form my weekly budget. &nbsp;Good night.</p>
<p>16th Nov.</p>
<p>Gee whiz, you should hear the drum fire at the moment. &nbsp;It&#39;s simply appalling.</p>
<p>This envelope looks tampered with, but it&#39;s just one that I opened a week or so ago, and took out the cigarette packets, for it was too bulky. &nbsp;And I can&#39;t afford to waste one, they&nbsp;are so scarce.</p>
<p>Sunday 18th</p>
<p>Yesterday I received Lockhart&#39;s of 24th Sept readdressed from A.A.S.C. Parkhouse. &nbsp;I&#39;m mighty glad to hear that Mum is keeping well. &nbsp;I see that the shop was able to keep its end up during the strike, and it&#39;s nice to notice the cheerful tone of it.</p>
<p>I had a letter from Mrs. Boydon telling me that Alex McDonald was wounded &amp; missing.</p>
<p>Well, Dad, this is not a bad attempt &amp; will keep you going for a little. &nbsp;There&#39;s not much more to mention, except that it&#39;s dull and sombre but quite mild. &nbsp;I&#39;m OK and hope are are well.</p>
<p>Fondest love to all,</p>
<p>Your loving Son</p>
