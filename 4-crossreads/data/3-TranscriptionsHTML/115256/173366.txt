<p>Saturday 27 April 1915</p>
<p>Yesterday's rumours were today's realities.  For we received definite news that one of our fellow troopships the "Manitau", with British troops on board had been attacked by a hostile submarine.  Three torpedoes were fired but without result and beyond the fact that everybody got a severe fright and confusion got the upper hand no damage was done.  The enemy's boat subsequently ran, or was run ashore so all this by wireless, accounted for yesterday's precaution as well as an armed guard during the early hours of the morning.</p>
<p>At 6.30 a.m. we passed Lemnos Bay light, and steaming up Lemnos Bay, we finally dropped anchor in the waters of Port Mudros.  They were all there, those British ships which are making history, including the "Queen Elizabeth" and the "Agamemnon".  And the troopships.  The bay was swarming with them.  Vessels of all sizes and descriptions taken from the mercantile marine both of France and England.  As a background not the sands of Egypt, but the welcome green hills of Lemnos.  And what with Britain's mighty warships, the ever moving small craft flying the Tricolor, and the innumerable merchant ships, this sight of the concentration at Lemnos was one of a lifetime.</p>
