<p>plane came across &amp; flew low down over our trenches.   I was trying to locate the Mortar which had been firing.   Machine guns &amp; rifles blazed out from all sides but he seemed to lead a charmed life as he was still going strong when we left.   Back again through Ravine Wood we touched at another post &amp; reached Camp shortly after 5 P.M. after a day of great interest.   The ground we covered was the scene of the great Messine battle &amp; the trenches, notices &amp; fill boxes of Fritz still stand &amp; serve to show what a wonderful advance it was.   It was a grand day, bright &amp; clear &amp; we could see, Ypres &amp; such places quite plainly &amp; shewed what a death trap it was for us prior to this advance.</p>
