Laying out the cable was really very much more dangerous than digging the trench for the coils of wire had to be carried from the dump about 4 miles back, the wires unrolled formed into a cable & hauled by hand into the position along the line of which the workers at night would dig, during the day time, & as the Huns could plainly see that this work was being performed they were able to make things quite lively at times but although the shells occasionally burst too close to be comfortable for those working on the cable, strange to say not a man of the party was hit.
