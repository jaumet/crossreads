<p>Sunday, 24 January, 1915<br/>In the morning before C.P. there was a large parade to headquarters where the Brigadier addressed the men, he told them that they were to move off and then gave them a severe lecture on keeping up the good name of the Australians, a Maadi resident had some fowls pinched and we are blamed.</p>
<p>My English friend called in the afternoon &amp; after showing him around the camp we went to Cairo to his house to tea.  Spent a very pleasant evening it is great to sit down to an English table with English friends, without being pestered by native waiters.</p>
<p>Monday, 25 January, 1915<br/>All the bearers of B sect went for a fine trip to Mons well [old Roman quarry] and Napoleon's Fort &amp; the Colonel &amp; Capt Fowler started revolver practice whilst the horses were eating and they nearly all cleared out.  They were caught after a long chase.</p>
<p>The drivers went for an all day march to Helouan.  Very hot day, the worst yet.  God forbid when summer comes.</p>
<p>The army service are transporting every day to Zeitoun.  At night all on leave in town were hunted up by a picket and made to return to camp as they had marching orders for the morning.</p>
