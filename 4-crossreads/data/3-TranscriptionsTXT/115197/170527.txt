 Good night and goodbye to Mr Higgo and family.&nbsp; These good people are friends of only a few hours acquaintance but we are not likely to forget them. 
 Back to the &quot;Rio Pardo&quot;. 
 During the day the &quot;Aeneas&quot; has left for Australia (bearing our mail) and the &quot;Beltana&quot; has arrived in Cape Town.
