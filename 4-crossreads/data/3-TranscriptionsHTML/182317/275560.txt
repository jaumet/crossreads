<p>26 Salisbury Rd Rose Bay 10 June '65<br/>Dear Fergie, I would have liked to have been present at your last appearance but was unaware of it. You were one of those that upheld the highest ideals of judgeship &amp; were one of perhaps a very few whose court could be relied on as being a place of peace &amp; courtesy where barristers knew a fair &amp; patient hearing would be had. Congratulations on your record &amp; every wish for  happy years of retirement. Kindest regards to Madge &amp; yourself. No reply necessary &ndash; a wave of recognition at the club quite sufficient. Yours sincerely B.V. Stacy</p>
