It was quite a pleasant little episode, and she was a very sweet piccaninny. 
We were issued with Rations, and stacked in cattle trucks "36-40 Hommes or 8 cheval". We got aboard the trucks about 5.30, but did not leave Le Havre station till 8. The floor was covered with about an inch of cement, and we were packed like sardines. Whenever anyone moved, the cement flew about and started us all sneezing.
