  
 been closed the previous evening and that I might be delayed a couple of days as the result, a loss of time which I could ill afford.  In the afternoon I went out to Auteuil and dined with friends.  Armed with a couple of Baedekers guide books on Italy I returned to the Leave Club and left by the 8.30 p.m. train for Modane & the Italian frontier.  I did not like the look of the weather - it was cold & windy with a few flakes of falling snow. The next morning the countryside was covered with snow and the train made slow progress.  Finally through an accident on the line or a block of snow, we had to go back some distance and go on again from Macon through Bourg, Amberieu, Culoz, Aix-les-Bains
