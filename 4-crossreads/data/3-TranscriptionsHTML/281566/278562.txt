<p>[Sketch of four German soldiers, in bunker with a bomb (60 lbs) ready to drop on top of them, captioned: When the Tadpole drops]<br/>The Effect  we Hope For]<br/>Our artillery further annoyed Fritz on the 11th  &amp;  during the night he had another shock. At 10 oclock (PM) the loud bomb explosions began to reverberate through our lines  &amp;  on standing to we perceived the   <strike>uneven</strike> space dividing our trenches from the Germans was left as bright as day by flares while machine guns rattled  &amp;  rifles cracked  &amp;  bombs crashed intermittently. It was our bombardment keeping the German sentries awake. Looking  over the parapet we saw on the German front for about 100 yards a dense cloud of fumes  &amp;  dust rising in the light of the flares. As each new bomb burnt a fountain of earth  &amp;  parapet flew upwards  &amp;  the Germans failing to root out their tormentors by means of machine gun  &amp;  rifle fire sent their red  &amp;  green flares streaming skywards as an appeal for artillery aid. It came in the shape of shrapnel which gave our lines a good peppering  &amp;  with a final salvo from our howitzers, the night resumed its normal conditions.</p>
