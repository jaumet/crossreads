<p>during the night 2 chaps died in the ward, &amp; to make me sleep they gave me a dose of morphia, this had the needed effect for soon I was in the land of dreams &amp; when morning came I felt quite refreshed, &amp; a lot of pain had gone, I was the only Australian in this Ward, &amp; I must say the sisters treated me real well bit of a difference to when I was in Rouen last year, &amp; the food was plentiful &amp; good but how these nurses had to work for the wounded were coming in so fast, they were working practically night &amp; day I felt sorry for them.</p>
<p>That day one of the Sisters told me I would be going to Blighty during the night this cheered me up a bit but the pain had started to come on again &amp; it got worse &amp;</p>
