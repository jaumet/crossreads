<p>31 January 1915<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>Reveille at 6<br/>No lunch today as we were on fatigues straightening camp &amp; lay out new lines shift tents up towards the mess room after lunch we all set to get new correspondence by the 12 oclock I had eight polished off so more than content to sit back in the afternoon Tob &amp; I went over to the hangar &amp; inspected [indecipherable] biplane which only a few months ago flew from Cairo to Khatoum a distance of 20 mls. This machine has flown lots of miles &amp; not one accident.  The  [indecipherable] is just swathed in names of well wishes of his admirers. At the rear is another [indecipherable] to judge by the [indecipherable] Bed at 10</p>
<p>1 February 1915<br/>Monday 15 wks from home</p>
<p>Reveille at 6<br/>Stables per usual which now is much easier because the troughs are attached to our lines &amp; for our use only. The squad Sig commenced work after a few days holiday &amp; they were a bit lax in this job, tonight Brits have to lay down after a good deal of trouble. After lunch huge motor transports began to arrive then later &frac12; battn of infantry put in an appearance later on in the night the other half also arrived these men form part of the second force &amp; are from [indecipherable] if possible [indecipherable] a real good time which follows a right royal feed after parading the streets for a while &amp; visiting renowned places we fill in the evening at the [indecipherable] Bed 11.00</p>
