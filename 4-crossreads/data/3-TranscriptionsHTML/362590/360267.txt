<p>experienced such a feeling of relief &amp; freedom, as when we were on the war ship beyond the range of bullets. The most anxious time I spent was when there were four hundred of us packed on a lighter, only a few hundred yards from perfect safety, with bullets now &amp; again splashing up the water within a few feet of us.</p>
<p>I hope that when we get into it again, which we expect to do in a few weeks time, it will not be trench warfare. It seems strange, that although we were all overjoyed to get clear of the Peninsular, we are all anxious to get back into action again. The thing that worries us I think, was the cold wet weather &amp; the knowledge that we were inadequately entrenched against the new guns they laid on us during the last few weeks.</p>
<p>If you don't get this letter write &amp; let me know. As soon as I get a chance to visit Cairo I will send out a few more things.</p>
<p>Give my love to all</p>
<p>Your affectionate son</p>
<p>Arthur</p>
