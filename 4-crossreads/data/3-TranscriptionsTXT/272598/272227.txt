Tuesday 28.8.17Arrived at Ebblinghem 6 Am, detrained, slung the old pack & equipment on my back & set off on foot to the unit, where I arrived at 7.15 Am in time for a much needed cup of tea & breakfast.  The day was occupied answering all enquiries & relating my experiences.   Fine budget of mail awaiting my arrival which I was pleased to get & read; it conveyed the good news that my diary had arrived home in good condition.  Feeling collar proud, find it difficult to get used to the old conditions again.
Wednesday 29.8.17Orderly Corporal for the day, feel rather strange at work once again.  Wrote home fixing up
