 Arriving at our destination we at once recognised the same place that we were in 17 months ago. It is a very quiet place being only a small villiage, but the surrounding country is all that is required for the rest that the Artillery are having. 
 Dec 20th - 17 After nearly a month of doing nothing we set out this morning per motor lorry for Dranoutre which is only a small villiage, a one horse show. 
 We are very lucky this time as regards our camp in every detail
