 A Turkish deserter, Ismail Mahomet Ali, 5th Co. 2 Bn. 24th Reg. was brought in today.  He appeared to be in good health but complained of sore feet.  He was only wearing thin shoes.

Examined, he said he came from a vilayet of  Sym  Smyrna, but that he was fed up with fighting, like a lot more of the Turks in his Co.
