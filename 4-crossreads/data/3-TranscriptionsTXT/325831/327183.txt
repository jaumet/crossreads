My dear Mr Justice Ferguson
I have received your letter, & quite agree with your dislike of the course proposed by your friends.
I do not think the Minister will hear of it except through the Adjutant General, so I think it best it should be known to that officer, & I have sent it to him, as he alone deals with questions of personnel.
Yours very kindly
Hubert Foster
