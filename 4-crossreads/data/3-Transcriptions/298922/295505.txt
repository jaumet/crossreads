<p>GAMLI</p>
<p>[The following paragraph is crossed through.]<br/>Nowell is only 1 mile away &amp; for the past 2 months has been quite close &ndash; I have seen him a few times, but he generally rakes up a Lord or a Duke from somewhere &amp; exudes that very English superior air &amp; of course is a Lt. Col, so we don't talk much about Carrakoorte &amp; old days. YES, I got DAYS SOKS with night ones long [indecipherable] &ndash; good soks too am start wearing 'em.</p>
<p>Last night a total eclipse put the moon out at about midnight, so got home without giving the HUNS a chance to bomb. Heavy DEW each night &amp; a blanket wanted, by day 110&deg; in the shade, <u>if any</u>.</p>
