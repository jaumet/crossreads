<p>1917<br/>February<br/>thinking that it was only a tale went careering about in a rickshaw with two others.  Military Police told them to stop, but they took no notice, yelling back at them that they were going to the pictures.   After the pictures were over they were returning to the town from the direction of the ocean beach, when the MP's stopped them and got them out of the rickshaw and put them in the lock up.   Next morning they were taken before the beak.   They asked to be sent down by rail to Cape Town but in reply were charged with being undesirable aliens and put in quod till the arrival of the next boat.   They were shipped across the harbor to the gaol and left there.   Miss Campbell several times visited them and brought them fruit.   The Borda was the next boat to arrive and they were shipped aboard as prisoners.<br/>However at Cape Town they were allowed on shore.  Before reaching Blighty Hawkins became ill and on arrival at Devonport</p>
