 10/7/16 Had a very quiet day yesterday, after tea went for a spin to the Coy & had a good yarn to the lads. About tea time a hostile Aeroplane was sighted right above us & our guns opened fire & the sky was a mass of bursting shells. We were afraid the bits would lob on us. A peice did drop over at the Coy quite close to one of the chaps. We have all been "under fire".
