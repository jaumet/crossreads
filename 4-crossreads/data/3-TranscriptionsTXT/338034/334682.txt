We were between two & three hours watering all the Brigade so did not get moving again till about 3 p.m. We camped for the night about 5 miles further on, at Bir el Arnussi which is our destination for some days I believe. We are about 5 miles South East of Mazar & 18 miles from the Turkish base at El Arish. The nearest Turkish outpost is only 5 miles beyond here, but it is apparently only occupied at irregular periods.Dec 5th Left Arnussi about 10 a.m. & moved another 2 1/2 miles Eastward to New Wells. Our regiment only is camped here
