4 DecemberSaturdaySoldiering here at present consists of endless watching & snipers & Pick & Shovel gangs, digging SAPS, trenches, & Dug out - About the only Parade we have is our Rifle Inspections. We are on half Rations, but the men are cheerful; & arrangements are being made to get a Canteen going on the Beach -The YMCA have been struggling for some time to run one but Freight from the Islands has been the trouble; the YMCA is a boon to the Soldiers giving them occasional Paper & envelopes, but not much else. The Allies are a wasteful people compared to the Germans & go in for much more luxury for their Soldiers.
