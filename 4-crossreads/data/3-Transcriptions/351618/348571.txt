<p>sleep till early morn. Very early our officer Mjr P.J. Ross with Howarth &amp; Matt &amp; ohs[others] left for Imbros Isld for a short spell. So far I am left in charge of the gun &amp; detachment. I was inoculated yesterday for cholera epidemic.</p>
<p>A German Taube dropped several bombs over our camp this evening. Luckily one of them did not explode. The one dropped on the beach exploded without incurring any casualties.</p>
<p>Sunday 18th<br/>A quiet day. Bought a tin of Nestles milk today for 2/-. Some of the soldiers bring over a packages of goods in their trips and can get anything they ask for them almost. Fancy 2/6 a packet for envelopes.</p>
<p>Monday 19th July<br/>Harvey Turton[?] arrived. Of course it meant plenty of chats about our drivers at Alexandria etc.</p>
<p>I must say candidly my health &amp; the weakness which came on me has interfered greatly with my nerve just now. One requires perfect health to be in good fighting trim.</p>
