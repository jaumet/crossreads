  
 12th I have got a dose of bronchitis but not [indecipherable] back - I am wondering how I would stand a  winter in France if I have to go there 13th Censored 14th Not much [indecipherable] & the days are slow I am not able  to go out at night at all just going along quietly - What a bevy of letters must be following me up, When they do come what a day I will have reading them all. 15th I went to Head Quarters AIF & got sick leave, one month, hope to get advance. Going to St Ann's on Sea tomorrow 16th I leave at noon for St Ann's, it is warm  & I am better - I have a lovely photo of my ribs & [indecipherable] 19th Raining hard - this place is colder than London I think - Probably go to Ireland end of this week, then return here
