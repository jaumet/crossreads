Saturday Nov 30The last week or so there has been nothing of interest to write. We have built a Divisional Race course with stand & Steeplechase track. All the good horses are in training for the coming Divisional Races which promises to provide a good days sport. First day Race Meeting. Second day Children's & Divisional sports. The kiddies of Richon are delighted at the prospect. We have had several inspections by our OC in preparation for the inspection by Div, Corp Generals & GOC. General Allenby.
