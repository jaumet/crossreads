<p>Sept 5th<br/>Sun 5th<br/>Sergeant Nelson went off duty yesterday morning sick, &amp; I am in charge of the Signallers at present. Stan &amp; Les was on duty from 8 oclock to 12 last night; Today Cpl Yule was sent away sick; Fleas appear to be very bad here and I put in a very uncomfortable night last night in consequence; The same party of 200 men were sent out again last night putting out barbed wire entanglements, &amp; as the full strength of the Regt is only 235 men they are not getting much spell as there are several fatigue parties told off every day for small jobs; I have had a swim every day since coming to Old No 1 Outpost; The Welch Pioneers who have been in the trenches here were sent away today, &amp; C. Sqd went into the trenches in their place; a Cruser has a bad habit of standing out about a mile from here &amp; firing her heavy guns kicking up a hell of a row.</p>
