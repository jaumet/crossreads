22/4/16Saturday night 11pm instead of having lights out &asleep the boys were playing cards. The major happened to come around & caught the tent behind ours. Our light went out before he saw it but B in the tent next to ours let out a few choice words. The major immediately called out - fall out the man that used that word -. Nobody moved in our tent so he came & made us all get dressed & fall out. We were absolutely innocent & B - had not the pluck to own up so we got pack drill & were called liars fools & pigs by the major. Frank Gow answered him back & he roared at him & sent us back. In the end we beat him & next morning  23/4/16  we had to sign papers give evidence etc etc just because he major heard our tent use the language. Spent the day writing letter.
