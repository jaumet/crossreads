<p>March 1917<br/>(5th continued)   When the lady came home from the job I was on yesterday I heard that Fritz had been shelling the place heavily during last night &amp; this morning &amp; had put two guns of a battery of three naval guns out of action.   The battery was about 100 yards behind us, &amp; an anti-aircraft gun about 50 yds on our left suffered, but only slightly.<br/>6th.   Last night I left here about 6 o'clock &amp; proceeded to Needle Trench.  I picked up a fatigue party there, detailed to take our material to the front line.  Leaving "Needle" we went on &amp; I picked up my four sappers at Rose Trench &amp; proceeded on past Miller's Son Post through</p>
