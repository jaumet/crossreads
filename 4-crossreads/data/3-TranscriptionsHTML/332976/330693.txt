<p>April 1916<br/>6th   The Engrs are doing the fatigue and guard of the ship to-day &amp; I am Sgt. of the guard.  The weather is clearing up considerably but the wind is very cold.<br/>We are now 150+ miles off land &amp; don't expect to see land before Colombo.<br/>8th   We sighted land unexpectedly this morning &amp; passed the "White Top Rocks" at about 1 PM and Cape Lewin about 7.30 PM.  The sight of land came as a surprise to most on board as it was rumoured yesterday that we would keep too far out to see it.  A steamer passed us on the Starboard side about 8.30 P.M.</p>
