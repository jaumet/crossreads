<p>[Wednesday 30 August 1916]</p>
<p>275 miles in 24 hours<br/>Calm Hot night   Steaming along Tripoli coast rugged &amp; Timbered:-<br/>Passed an Italian Hospital ship it was near here that this boat ran into an Italian Tramp &amp; cut it in two, easily done in the dark &amp; caused by the NO Light rule.<br/>This day week we should be in England.  I must be careful not to tell too many back country yarns there!!<br/>We are over the Spanish coast from here &amp; so on to Gibratler.</p>
