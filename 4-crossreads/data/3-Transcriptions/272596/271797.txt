<p>We arrived at Suez about 12 oclock thus making a very fast trip of 13 hours from end to end.  the day was nice &amp; sunny all the way, traces of trenches barb wire entanglements camps piers &amp;etc are still showing where they were going to defend the Canal if the Turks got that far.  apart from this there is very little else to be seen, you would be surprised at the wash a ship causes going through the canal itself, seems to suck all the water from the bank about 20 yards in front of the boat &amp; when she passes the water gets very agitated &amp; beats itself in to a passion &amp; tears at the sandy banks  its a most peculiar feeling gliding for miles through these sandy wastes &amp; only a thin ribbon of blue water stretching in front for miles, just before passing through the "Bitter Lakes"</p>
