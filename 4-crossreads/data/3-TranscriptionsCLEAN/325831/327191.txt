 Dear Sir 
 You told me to write if I was in any difficulty, & I am taking the liberty of doing so now. About a fortnight ago I was warned to hold myself in readiness to proceed to the front at short notice. As you know, my name was withdrawn from the list through outside influence at the very last minute, & most of my friends went forward. This week a further list of officers to proceed to the front has been published, & my name has been left off, probably for the same reason. Now that the only obstacle in the way of my going forward has been removed, do you think it would be possible for me to proceed with this draft? I have been in camp now for fourteen months, & all my pals are over there. I unfortunately missed my turn through no fault of my own, & the longer I stay in camp the worse it is for me from every point of view. 
 I remain 
 Yours respectfully 
 K. Ferguson
