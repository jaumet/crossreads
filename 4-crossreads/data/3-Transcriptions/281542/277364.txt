<p>Am feeling better, much to my relief.</p>
<p>Arthur Gray called on me with Red Cross Sergt.  Had a chat about home &amp; the war.  He had received no letters beyond a couple from Clara.  Gave him 6 pkts cigs, 2 tins bloater, 2 lemonade powders, 1 pkt tobacco, as he had been short.  I was glad of his call; it is indeed refreshing to come into contact with one so closely connected with home.  I live a pretty solitary life here &ndash; no pals, no one to chat with as they are mostly N.Z's &amp; complete strangers to me.  Beyond a good day salute &amp; the usual formal talk connected with my work with those around me, I have little distraction.  It's a long day &ndash; I am awake at 6.30 &amp; go on duty not later than 8 am.  9.30 pm is my average hour of knocking off &amp; there is nothing to do but to creep into one's dug-out &amp; try to sleep.  My active brain does not give me much peaceful sleep however.  Each night I am visited with grotesque dreams of vivid variety but little coherence &amp; in the morning I awake with a thick head &amp; no remembrance of the fantasies of the night.</p>
<p>8 pm &ndash; Seem to have entirely recovered from yesterday's sickness.  Hope recovery is permanent.</p>

<p>Wednesday 8th Sept. 1915</p>
<p>Decided to walk to Walkers Ridge as I heard mail had arrived.  Set out 2 pm &amp; on arrival was rewarded for my trouble in receiving 2 letters from Mab, 1 Mum &amp; 1 from Gran.  No letters from Grace, Dad or C.M.</p>
<p><strike>Mab's letters dated 18th &amp; 26 July Grace's 19th Mum 23rd July</strike></p>
<p>Mab says in her <strike>first</strike> letters she has been expecting another letter from me every day.  She does not realise I was on the water right up to the 26th July <strike>when</strike> on</p>
