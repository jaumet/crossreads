<p>replied to from Doles.  Also had a letter from Ella Sutherland &amp; a parcel of cigarettes &amp; tobacco from Uncle Charlie &amp; Aunt Annie which was very welcome.</p>
<p>Sunday 10th to Sunday 17th<br/>The weather has been quite dull of late &amp; we have had several light showers.  The days are lengthening out &amp; getting warmer.  Work is as usual fairly slack &amp; I get a chance to put in a bit of time learning Arabic  Take 3 lessons a week, on Monday, Wednesday &amp; Friday nights.  It helps to put in some of the evenings.  When the nights are a bit cold I generally go round to Mrs Warners get warm by the fire &amp; then turn in.  They only live about 2 or 300 yards from our quarters.<br/>In the afternoons Burrows of the 10th LH &amp; myself generally go round to the British Recreation club &amp; play billiards &amp; read the latest papers.  At the Quarters a piano has been installed &amp; the big hall furnished with tables &amp; chairs</p>
