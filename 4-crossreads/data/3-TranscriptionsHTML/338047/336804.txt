I was fairly tired so did not go into the village, which was further up the valley. We thought we had come back for a long spell so made a fine big dugout out of salvaged Fritz galvanised iron etc. In this valley was a railway shunting yards with damaged locomotives. They had been either shelled or bombed, and belonged to Fritz.<br/>[Photograph is included titled No 64 9th Btn Mopping up German Dugouts at Cappy 25.8.18]<br/>Fritz had a big gun here that he intended to use for firing at Amiens. It only fired a few shots</p>
