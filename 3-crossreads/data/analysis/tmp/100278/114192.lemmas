 sinc the push start . Sinc I have been in Franc I have taken particular notic of the German I have seen , and they have been quit a number and one thing has struck me forcibl and that is the peculiar nose that the major have , the nose is veri thin at the bridg and as it goe out it get broad and thick and the nostril stand out promin , and in near everi case the nose tilt upward and then again the face seem to reced from the eyebrow to the mouth which give their face a milkdish look , although we are descend in a way from certain peopl of Germani there is a great differ today , in the featur of the British and the Bosch . 7th Did not get too much sleep last night , after the nice soft bunk we had in our last billet , the hard floor seem much out of place .
