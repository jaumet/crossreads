<p>Dear Mr. Fry,<br/>Can you oblige by letting me have a contribution from your pen for publication in the next issue of the P. S. Journal? I know you can produce good stuff and I am desirous of getting some of it. In a paper like ours variety is half the battle, and I wish therefore to have a good many contributors, provided, of course, if, like you, they possess brains.</p>
<p>Very truly yrs<br/>John Osborne</p>
