104 Dec 31stas a new year gift, in return for their many Kindnesses to us since being here -
We all caught 8 pm train for Doubledays, where we spent a most enjoyable evening, meeting a lot of new friends - It was the first time we were afforded the pleasure of listening to Miss Doubleday play the violin & it was really splendid. I cannot express how gracefully she plays.
