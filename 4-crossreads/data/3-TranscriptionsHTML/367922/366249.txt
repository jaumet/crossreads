<p>Finally, I beg your acceptance of the two little photographs which are enclosed. The one of Dene shows him rather young, it was taken a year or two before the War commenced, he is standing among the trees at home which he loved so much.</p>
<p>The other is interesting because it shows what Dene could do in the way of photography sometimes, and it shows what the War can do to break up happy homes. The boys and girls are all Dene's playmates on many a happy occasion. Counting from the left, the youth balancing a ball on the racket is Lieut, Randolph Magnus, now in Randwick Hospital with severe wounds. Next, Private Alec Magnus now returned after two years of weary and wearing life on the sands of Egyp and Palestine. Next Alan Fry, killed at Pozieres, lance corp. in the famous 13th., "which is only a name now." On the right is Sergeant Edgar Cliff, a bonny lad over 6 ft 1 and a gunner in the Australian Field Artillery, who was wounded in France and is now convalescing. Under him at the butt of the tree is Dorothy Fry, Dene's sister, a most gifted artist, and at the other end in black is my younger daughter Hazel, now the mother of a war baby 14 months old, whom the father Capt. Watson (now in Harefield Hospital convalescing) has never seen. You must forgive me for inflicting these details upon you, but they are more or less connected with your late member, my well loved son Dene.</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
