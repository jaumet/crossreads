they reckon it's the best Mess on the Plains & I believe it for it is really first class.  There is a draft going way to France from here tonight.
14th Had us out on an early morning parade doing platoon & Company drill, after this breakfast & an interview with Capt. Foster about our future work & when we start.  I think we will go on General Instruction work.  Hot & muggy again today wants a good fall of rain to clear the atmosphere.
