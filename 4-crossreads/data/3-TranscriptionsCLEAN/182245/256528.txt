 JANUARY 1917 
 13 SATURDAY 
 Very cold, with rain snow & sleet 
 Cleaning harness & exercising 
 horses all day long. Some 
 of the boys came back from 
 the trenches today & they 
 say the conditions there are 
 a lot better than they are here. 
 Got a letter from Mother & one 
 from Bob Worthington also 
 a cable from Linda. 
 I was on horse picket at night 
 Warren Hogarth went up . to 
 the front line trenches with 
 the others.
