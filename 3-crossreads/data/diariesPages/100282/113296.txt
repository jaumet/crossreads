we left him alone, cursing swearing like a trooper, he was little more than a boy . Another beautiful sunny day. We are having bonza weather now, such a difference to this time last year.
23rd One of Fritzie's planes caused a mild sensation here this morning, there was a very heavy mist, we could hear the hum of an aeroplane very plainly of course we took no notice thinking it was one of our own, imagine our surprise to see through the odd break in the mist a German plane, she was too low down for our anti aircraft guns even to fire, but the machine guns opened out on her properly, some of A Coy opened fire on her with their rifles, but she got away from us, although she was brought down over Ypres, they reckon why he was so low was because his "controls" jammed so left her unmanageable. The Battalion played the Brigade Machine Gunners beat them easily
