11/8/17 Rouenthereafter.  The river is navigable right in the centre of the town and troops were being embarked on a channel steamer.  Some showers of rain.  Made an excursion up the street and bought a necktie and then had a look at the wonderful big church of Notre Dame - the front very elaborately carved and ornamented.  The Tour de Beurre is very fine and was erected from funds obtained from indulgences to eat butter during Lent and is quite unlike the other tower which is whitened with more years.  Between the two a tapering spire rises and you can see through it.  Inside the church is not as airy as the Amiens one & carries the impression of having more building in it.  Some of the side portals are wonderfully carved and the stained glass fine indeed.  Being the scene of the death of Joan of Arc the town is naturally full of memorials and references to her.  another pretty old corner is the Grosse Horloge, the markings on the clock face as very extraordinary.  Everywhere there are old buildings leaving the mark of many years on
