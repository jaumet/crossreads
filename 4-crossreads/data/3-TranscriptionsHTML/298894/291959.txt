<p>rather upset about the rush of work. We actually should have 70 more orderlies &amp; 8 more medical men. There appear to be plenty ambulance men on the island but they are all under orders to move off at once &amp; are held in readiness to deal with the wounded at the new landing by taking them off in ships.</p>
<p>5th August Thursday. Still going strong but have managed to complete all scripts etc. to time, my fear now is to get drugs enough &amp; quick enough as I have used up a large quantity. Rumours have arrived concerning the new landing. Tis said it has been carried out without opposition. The guns which shelled w beach I believe are now controlled by moniters.  They have 2 &ndash; 14 inch guns &amp; are trained to a foot on  Chanak. When they start we reply which causes them to shut up shop. my stay there would have been more comfortable if the moniter had been available before</p>
<p>Friday 6th. Kept pegging along briskly. Had an invitation to visit the "Swiftsure" but could not get away.</p>
<p>7th Saturday. Extremely busy day, could not have my usual dip. Patients increased to over 1000 and drugs for treatment of diarrhea running out.</p>
<p>Sunday 8th. Arranged to go out in Colonels motor boat to visit the "Swiftsure"  Arrived about 6 P.M. but unfortunately she was under orders to sail at 7.30 so only had a short time aboard. In that time, however, we were conducted down to our officer friend's cabin treated to drinks were given cigarettes etc, regaled</p>
