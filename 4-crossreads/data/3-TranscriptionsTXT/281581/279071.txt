 I noticed a patrol of come 12-15 Cavalry on our right, with about 6 on the left; naturally thinking they were our own patrols, we leisurely walked in their direction. When only 400 yards distant, we were speedily disillusioned by a volley of rifle fire. There was no mistaking identity now; for I discovered we had all but run into a patrol of Turkish Cavalry. As the distance between us and the car was too great to make, and I did not wish the whole of the rifle fire to be directed against us, should we attempt to escape in the car, I gave the order for the car to immediately get out of range. As it disappeared from view, the batteries enfilading the road from the east bank of the Jordan, opened up and sniper its retreat with 10 pounders.
