<p>August 7<br/>colour of the skies, glinting with stars, gold in the clear air, and the Chateau and its trees, its broken roof silhouette against the stars, and the vines and plants about its masses, promised some of the unrealised beauty of French old buildings, but this morning, its beauty was gone, and remained only the fine colour of old bricks and stone dressing slowly decaying.</p>
<p>Grounds overrun with deep grass:  trees in groups, great splendidly foliaged chestnuts.</p>
<p>A Drafting room under the slates, on the corner tower, from the line the irregular guns beating hollowly and deeply.  Tomorrow?  All today on its plans.</p>
<p>Tonight by the water point met Frank Hungerford:  he now, since the first Somme stunt in Corps Sigs.  Changed and pale, all his old fine colour is gone:  and he is thin and lacking in all his old animalism.</p>
<p>The telling tonight is of leave increasing.  August 9 sending the first lot of twelve a week.</p>
<p>Again with the dark comes back the old beauty of the place:  standing on the steps, in the high doorway, spread in front a broad drive terrain and a great lawn behind:  and full fronting the building centre, from the cleaness of the lawn two great chestnuts of black-blue stand sentinel, and behind the long line stretches of darkling green and blue, breaking at the left and right, to far stretchings of misting country:  the sides are deep tread, and the soft colourings</p>
