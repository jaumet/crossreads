Friday 3 December, 1915
Sent to Gozo. Up at 5.15, a breakfast by candlelight & a drive down to the boat in the grey dawn. It felt like being at the fitout again.
Our boat left at 6.30 & arrived at Gozo at about 8.30.
Our quarters are in barracks in an old fort here. I have been put in No 3 Section.
I am with a New Zealander who knows Ernie Kennedy in N.Z.
The name of the fort is Fort Shambray [Chambray].
Did my weeks pay at cards.
