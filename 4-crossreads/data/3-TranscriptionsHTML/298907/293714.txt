<p>In the afternoon I went out as arranged to meet the girls, we spent an enjoyable afternoon round about the Park for she is a real nice girl &amp; so sensible her father is an Accountant in the city &amp; they seem fairly well to do, the girl has not long come from her "finishing School" &amp; is real interesting to talk too I took her into Birmingham for tea &amp; sent her home with flowers &amp; chocolates its wonderful what a chap can mix with over here if you only go the right way about things, her mother trusts her with me, so she's as right as rain the old camera accompanies me on all my expeditions so she will be able to tell some tales in the years to come.</p>
<p>They have been expecting a General to come &amp; visit the Hospital, but he phoned down this morning that he would not be able to come for some reason</p>
