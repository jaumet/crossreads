looking building it was not equal to the Brook War Hospital either in appearance or suitability
I struck trouble as soon as I reached the hospital on account of having somebodys wheel-chair It wasn't my fault. I found the chair in the ward and in it went for a tour round the ward to see if I could find anyone who had been in the 3rd Battalion
Arriving at "A" Ward where all the double amputation cases were kept somebody taking me unawares that is coming up at the back of the chair laid hands on it. I foolishly lost control of myself.
The front of the schools was nicely laid out
