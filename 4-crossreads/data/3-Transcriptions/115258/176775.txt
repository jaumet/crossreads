<p>I will wait a bit and see if they are really going to keep it up before I cable, but if they do my plans are to go to Cairo, see Miss Davidson and get my photo taken, as Mother asked for it, and then make a dash for Luxor and have a couple of days down there - Jim Ayre wants to go too, so it will be fun if we can work it together. But of course one can&#39;t be too certain of these leaves, as a lot depends on how the train line over the different wadies etc. between this and Kantara behaves itself during this rainy season. One thing about Egypt is that they only have about two days ^<sup>rain</sup> down there whereas we have about three months up here.</p>
