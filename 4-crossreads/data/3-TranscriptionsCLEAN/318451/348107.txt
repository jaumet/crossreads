  
 As I have not been able to keep a daily record of events while at Alquines, I will set down a general account of our stay.  The past ten days has been a time of very solid training with a march of about 3 miles every day to the parade ground.  Men have been instructed in Bomb throwing.  Every man threw live bombs, fired Rifle grenades & most of them Lewis guns also, besides going through a course of musketry.  Then followed Battalion drill & Brigade drill in preparation for "going over the top".  Each Batt. & each Coy. in the Battn. had its place allotted & the practice was very satisfactory. A holiday was given the men on Tuesday last.  It was a lovely spring day & the country looked fine, the trees bursting into bud & wild flowers peeking up by the roadside & overall an air of peace, which was quite inconsistent with the
