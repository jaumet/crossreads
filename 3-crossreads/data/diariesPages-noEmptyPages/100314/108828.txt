30/1/18 London
of "worms and flyes" Lunched for 10d at a Lyons cafe and then went into Old Bailey and heard the Recorder try and acquit two soldiers for assault. Then heard part of a case of procuring charged before Judge Athelan Jones (?) Walked down Fleet St. and then to Blackfriars bridge where I bought a surprising number of packets of biscuits for 1/6 and had to carry this large parcel back via tube to Hotel. There cast off my mufti and resumed uniform once more. Packed up all my belongings. Went for dinner to Ye Olde Cheshyre Cheese in Fleet St and in the old place dined off the Pudding Pancake Toasted cheese and Ale having as table companions an NSA naval officer and his consort! To hotel about 9 and did some writing. The whole city very dark after sunset.
