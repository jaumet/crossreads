 Revielle as per usual. 
 Went up like a lamb to the slaughter this morning &amp; had a pretty gruelling time, the injections settled me for I couldn't stand the stuff &amp; I went clean out to it a couple of times consequently he only drew three &amp; I have to go again on Wednesday. Felt pretty ill all day, I was foolish to go so soon after the inoculation &amp; I guess I wont be caught the next time. 
 Started the Pitch last night &amp; secured a good spot to play on if only the niggers keep off it. 
 Horses went out as usual &amp; Norm took out Pards lunch for I couldn't hold a bar let alone see the road. 
 Wrote letters &amp; then turned in early 8 pm.
