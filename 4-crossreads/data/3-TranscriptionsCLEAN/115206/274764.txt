 Vaux- sur- Somme.2nd Bty.Position Weather fair but cloudy. Our balloons very active. Hear we are being relieved by 3rd Division to be correct the 30th Battery. Played cards - no luck. At 5pm Five Fritzer planes came across our lines. At this time our balloons were well up forward with no fighting plans guarding them. At this time, only three planes were visible. Two planes made for a balloon each and caught them, bringing them both down in flames. A beautiful piece of work
