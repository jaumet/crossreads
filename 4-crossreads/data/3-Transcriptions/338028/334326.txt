<p>Wednesday 7/6/16</p>
<p>Wrote home, beautiful day, swimming nearly all day, received severe shock when news came that Lord Kitchener and his staff were drowned, we are not getting the best of it lately, and shudder to think of what is ahead of us if our arms are not fulfilled.</p>
<p>Thursday 8/6/16</p>
<p>Officer came down to pay us and told me I had to go in charge of seventy men to Tel-el-Kebir that night. I had to pack a big box of drugs etc which went on a transport, I fell my men in at six pm and marched them to Kantara thence by train to Tel-el-Kebir, waggons took our stuff and I then marched the men up, reported and dismissed them, then saw the Dr and he was pleased to see me for her wanted to go on leave and moreover he could not get through the sick parades without drugs, and my man was not much good.</p>
<p>Friday 9/6/16</p>
<p>Unpacked my things and did big sick parade and was busy all day getting supplies in then we heard the latest orders owing to our horses being sick we will not be able to draw them for a time and the regiment has to move off to Kantara at six am to0morrow, leaving a troop of each squadron to attend to the horses, so I had to pck up once again.</p>
<p>It is heartbreaking this rescindering orders and I am getting so used to this moving that am quite callous to it now. Dr got out of it all by going on leave leaving me to carry on.</p>
