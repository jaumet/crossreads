<p>I am so glad to hear that Keith has been having a really good holiday &amp; hope that he is as nearly his old self again as can be expected in the time.

<p>I have now had a long spell in England and am looking forward to its end. My board on the 9th inst. passed me for another month's Home Service but I think the next one should mark me as fit for General Service.

<p>For a fortnight we have had the same mild &amp; fine weather that I experienced in January two years ago</p>
