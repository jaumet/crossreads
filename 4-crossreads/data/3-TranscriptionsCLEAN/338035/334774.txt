  
 Maguire our O/C paid us a visit from the "Argyllshire" on board of which were our A Section. We cannot see the mountains or the city at all now as a thick mist has completely blotted them out.  Capetown  During my short stays on shore and the route march of yesterday I had a chance to see some of the City and was very well pleased with the surroundings and the management of the City.  The policemen are dressed a little different to ours and seem to be mostly Dutch people.  We were told that there are seven black to every white here and it just about looked it.  The trams mostly double deckers seemed to run very frequently to the different suburbs. I had runs to Russell St., Tamboerskloff [Tamboerskloof] and part of way to Sea Point in the trams. Other trips were Wynburg, [Wynberg] Kloff St. [Kloof] & other places.  The trains run from the Docks to Sea Point & runs through the streets in some places. The Town Hall & General Post Office are good buildings as also the Musuem & Public Library. The streets are well kept and sanitation excellent.  Electricity seems to be universally used even in suburbs. The Pier (a new one) is the pride of Capetown and on it they hold Promenade Concerts.  There are two main  theart  theatres and Ethel Irving was acting at one.
