<p>Whoever told you or anyone that the Y.M.C.A. gave anything away.  The certainly do give papers &amp; view books &amp; now &amp; then a bit of writing paper.  These are all right for fodder, no one ever reads them.  But for a small cup of cocoa, unsweetened I have paid 3d. in a Y.M.C.A.  In London one does get a real good meal for 1/- or so &amp; that is practically a gift because it would cost every bit of that to produce.  The Volunteer Ladies work the business &amp; they deserve all the credit.  It is the individual efforts of our People (I am English now) that give us this boon, not the Y.M.C.A.  Red Cross I don't know about.  The Boys in France know better.  We can get anything we want here for Patients but not Staff, i.e., in ordinary comforts.  But, we have had Cricket, Tennis, Hockey</p>
