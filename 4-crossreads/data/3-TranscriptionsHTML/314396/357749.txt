<p>quickly got out. The water boat came up alongside on the port side &amp;  it was the fun of the world watching them. They are manned wholly by niggers &amp;  they couldn't tie up. One of the boats broke away &amp;  the tug had to pull it up again. Took them nearly all the morning to get them fixed. Our boys threw down money to them &amp; they would let the ropes go &amp;  grab for the money.<br/>The English cruiser "Yarmouth" came in this morning. The water boat men are real funny. Two of our boys went ashore &amp;  I ordered 6 silk handkerchiefs  &amp;  a field manual of Engrs. The German prisoners from the Emden. 45 men 2 warrant officers, 2 Officers &amp;  the captain also a nephew of the Kaiser's were the total strength of the prisoners. They came <strike>onboa</strike> aboard &amp;  the guard fixed bayonets &amp;  charged their rifles in front of the prisoners. They were put in the after end &amp;  they were stripped &amp;  all their clothing examined.  Some had on their caps SMS Emden, others 4II Torpedo Division. &amp;  Scheiff Artillerie Sch<strike>arez</strike> warz. The name of the nephew is <strike>Count</strike> Prince Franz Joseph of Hohenzollern. Nothing much else only watching the boats coming back with our men. We took on tea, &amp;  marrows.</p>
<p>Tuesday 17th. Nov 1914.<br/>At 12.30 was awaked by the Kidlets here. The YMCA man had only just got back then bringing oranges, cocoanuts, &amp;  bananas. The boys bought &amp;  we ate. Got up at &frac14; to 7 &amp;  felt very tired. It is real hot here in the daytime &amp;  cool in the morning &amp;  night.</p>
