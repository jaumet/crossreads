<p>is rotten to see everyone getting letters &amp; I can't get one but never mind Bill every dog has his day but my day seems a long time coming: The routine while we are here will be reveillie 6 am: phisical jerks 7.30 to 8 am: breakfast 8.30 am: actual parade 9.15 am to 12 noon &amp; 1.45 pm to 4.30 pm with dinner at 12.30 pm &amp; tea at 6 pm so we are not going to have an easy time of it:</p>
<p>Saturday July 1st <br/>billets: fair day: reveille 6 am: physical jerks 7.30 &ndash; 8 am: on guard at the main gate 9 am: plenty of saluting &amp; presenting arms to the "Knuts" all the time: plenty of planes about also a couple of taubes: after tea a mob of our "fighters" were kicking around &amp; Fritz pasted into them a treat: they are monster planes all right: a very heavy bombardment down La Bassee way started at dusk &amp; kept up all the night: Fritz also had search lights going &amp; done a lot of anti-aircraft firing so I suppose our 'planes were on a raid: got a letter from Mum &amp; one from Len (the first) &amp; the news was certainly new to me: They were addressed to B. Coy. so I might to get my mail all right now:</p>
<p>Sunday July 2nd <br/>billets: good day: on guard till 9 am: Capt "Fossil" informed us that our old billet (streaky bacon) was "mafish": Fritz turned a sausage machine on to it &amp; set it on fire &amp; all that is left is the chimney &amp; a few bricks he also got another church in Armentieres: This must be the last efforts of a desperate foe: our side is showing who is who now &amp; I reckon the war will be lucky if it sees this month out: Holy Communion 10 am &amp;</p>
