Got leave and went into Melbourne for a final visit. We went to see the comedy "The Girl in the Taxi" and enjoyed it immensely.

Dec 6th Sat.

Early this moring the P.O. came down to our sleeping quarters and found a large number of the men in hammocks after Reveilie" had sounded, half an hour previously.

He went upstairs in a rage and ordered the bugler to sound the "fall In". The result was a large number failed to put in an appearance. Those who turned up were taken out for a march. Those who did not turn up were paraded before the O.G. and given a word of comfort.

Some of them discovered that they were put on extra picket, later, and put it down as a punishment for being late. After dinner we paraded in full dress. Marched to the Royal Park and treated to drinks by the Officers. Got back to the ship about 5 o’clock and found a large number of people waiting to see the ship go out.

Moved off from the wharf at a quarter past six. The send off was partially spoilt owing to the people being kept off the wharf.
