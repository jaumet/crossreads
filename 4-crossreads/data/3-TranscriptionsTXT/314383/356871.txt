May 14thUp at 3am 18 miles today.  The track very dusty & weather extremely hot.  A party of nomads were sighted a few miles ahead when we started & and after going a couple of hours, a group of Kurds rushed them from a sheltered valley.  Our advance guard hopped in & and the Kurds soon got tho about 20 remained on the road & cooly watched us pass.  The Nomad outfit was a scream, about 30 people in all, driving a flock of sheep, a few cows & carrying all their paraphanalia, fowls tied by the legs in pairs slung over the backs of quiet sheep.  The shelters strapped to the cows.  The men riding small pack donkeys & the women walking carrying spare gear.  We escorted them as far as our camp.
