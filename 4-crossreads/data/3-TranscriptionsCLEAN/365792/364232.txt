Ewart my son, I'm afraid you're in for it; & it's a pity too, because you hate visiting & kidstakes. And again you'll have to behave real well - perhaps "Gods demesne, Australia" is for "mine" always.  Just licked a couple of other patients at Croquet; rather a nice, quiet game it is - for one eyed men. Left for Harefield per motor bus at 2 pm. My mate & I were on top & had a glorious view. We passed through some beautiful Country, made a fellow feel happy to be alive & well. Arrived here about 4.30 changed into Hosp suits, saw the Doc, & then had tea. It's a ripping place & our own nurses too! The village is just close by & the grounds & country round about are beautiful. A fellow can go for a nice [in margin] Harefield
