<p>to everyone, I would give something to be let reorganize this Camp &amp; also the work.  goodness only knows how many instructors are hanging on here trying to get out of going to France some of them are afraid to look us in the face they have been away from the Battalion so long, thank God I'm not afraid to meet anyone for I have done my bit &amp; little more. &amp;  can look them square in the face &amp; not turn all colours</p>
