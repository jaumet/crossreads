<p>4.  to know that Tom Porman is still well.  I suppose you know that this is the 3rd year now for us.  We've completed 2 years in the army.<br/>Last Sunday we had Young Wally Paterson, Reg, Close &amp; Milton over to see us.  We had quite a good long yarn about old Times.  I went to see the "Merry Widow" played on Monday night.  It was very nice of course.  Gipsy Love is on for next week.<br/>Well, Mum, I will write to Dad &amp; George within the course of a few days.  It is<br/>Time for me to go the rounds now &amp; I'm pretty tired too.  I can lie in bed Tomorrow till 8 am. so there's one consolation in that &amp; also to hear Ellis grumble when He has to turn out at 6.45 am.<br/>Best of Love to You all &amp; Kind remembrances to those who are interested in us.  We are both well &amp; feeling fit<br/>Love<br/>Harry X</p>
