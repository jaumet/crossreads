<p>I did my bit &amp; then arranged with one of those guarding other goods to look after mine.</p>
<p>I managed to get some Post cards, nuts etc and did a little buying off the celebrated "Bum" Boats which can even be found at Embros.</p>
<p>Thursday 4th Nov 1915<br/>Did further buying to-day and managed to secure a few more items. It looked like rain &amp; QMS Maclaren who I had chumed in with decided to leave next day by trawler but I was inclined to stay another day. How I am to get all my cases away I don't know. The task for one man is an impossible one</p>
