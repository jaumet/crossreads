<p>April 16 1918</p>
<p>My dear Judge Ferguson<br/>I have just chanced on to your Red Cross appeal on April 16. It is, if I may say so, admirable. Nothing is harder to write: it should have won your fund a million.</p>
<p>And what a very beautiful piece of prose is that of [indecipherable] in the "SMH" of the same day.</p>
<p>Down here for a few days' work. Very hot everywhere &amp; in Jordan Valley it is hell. Often up to 120: a lot of primary malaria &amp; much other sickness</p>
<p>Kindest regards to you all<br/>Harry [Gilbert]</p>
