Sun. Feb.16There was a Church Service on Deck this morning but I was too busy to attend. Last night I had a most peculiar dream. I dreamt that I was Home with Lill.  The going home to our place was rather hazy, but when we did get there, I dreamt that Lill went down on her knees &amp; commenced to pray.[indecipherable] she was offering thanks for my safe return or asking for strength to stand my company is what's got me thinking.This is our second Sunday on the mighty ocean, &amp; the trip has been quite comfortable, so far.Mon. Feb.17The weather is getting quite hot now, &amp; the sun is beginning to tan our faces. The crowd are a healthier  looking lot now than they were when they came aboard. We had some very nice mutton for Dinner which went down well. We were paid today &amp; I drew the magnificent sum of 7 shillings. My Pay Book showed a credit of about 2&pound; when I handed it in to the Pay Office, but they managed to find an item of 2&pound;.6.0 which put me in debt, that was why I drew such a small sum. I hope I manage to get a couple of Pounds for Colombo, as I have very little in the way of souvenirs &amp; I'd like to take some little items Home to B.E. Gee: its jolly Hot. I've even raised a sweat as I sit writing
