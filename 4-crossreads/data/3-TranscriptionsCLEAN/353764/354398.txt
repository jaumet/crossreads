Today I heard that promotion was near for me, in as much that I am to be appointed a Warrant Officer in a short time.  After this I don't think I will have to wait long before I gain my Commission.  I will Cable when this takes effect.Still no mail.I also heard that we are to be The Head Qrts Coy 3rd Div.  So I suppose it will alter address considerably.There is nothing much doing here to-day, so will wind up.
7.2.16Very quiet & ordinary day with nothing of any importance happening.  W.O. in trouble with Major.  But everything eventually patched up.  Have felt sick all day but am very much better to-night.  Days work consisted of Rifle Drill & route march in the evening. Held Concert to-night & there were some very good items rendered. Special lookout being kept for Niggers.  Had a few kit bags stolen, so poor beggars have lost all their belongings
8.2.16  TuesdayHad a very busy day
