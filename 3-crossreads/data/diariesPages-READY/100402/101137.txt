Tuesday 17 September
Last night a night of incidents. In a motor ride to C.C.S. at La Chapelete we got lost went all over the country in moonlight. Fritz bombed the other side of the village (Buire) causing casualties including killed. A most terrific storm flooded me out my place in hut.
Fritz shelled the camp area causing us to take refuge in dugouts. The big stunt is for to-morrow we expect to be very busy. Dummy tanks are to be used to draw fire from the Boshe.
