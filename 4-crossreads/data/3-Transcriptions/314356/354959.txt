<p>December 26<br/>One disappointing episode &ndash; Hardy arrived, self-invited, with the General.  He'd made up his mind for a programme, and he beat us.  In the early afternoon he offered two bottles of whisky &ndash; and we refused.  So he joined the General's party &ndash; issuing instructions through Q to Richards to call on him at 6.45 when they would meet the General together.</p>
<p>The G.O.C. [General Officer Commanding] was great &ndash; absolutely genuine and without "Bulleeh" [?].  Later Geoff blew in and confirmed his popularity.  George, half screwed, wailed on him.</p>
<p>Altogether a bon night.</p>
<p>December 26<br/>Last night I watched Racy:  and later &ndash; after a dozen exquisite punches &ndash; I tackled him.</p>
<p>Once at Courcellette, Arthur, of the Amb. and I (drunk perhaps) yarned of the difficulty of obtaining good models:  he told of a dozen "seduction" experiences &ndash; of girls &ndash; and men &ndash; suddenly asked to pose.  Morality outraged.  Yet, the whole concern is so rotten, that I asked Racy if he would remember my asking:  both of us were half over, but even then he &ndash; by the very request &ndash; thought I was quite over.  Then he promised.</p>
