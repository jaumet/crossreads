Made Fulton cart 2000 pieces of brick to represent bombs from the village. Most elaborate organization in this operation. In the afternoon busy writing orders preparatory to another stunt tomorrow and a night operation tonight. At 5 o'c attended a lecture by Capt Johnson on Court Martials & Military Law - rather good. After mess walked out with all the officers and NCOs & went over the ground for tonights operation. Then returned and did other work until 9.40 pm when all moved off and silently defiled to our positions getting on to the J.O.T. to the nick of time and in silence that was contrasted markedly to the noise of the units in rear of us. The attack went fairly well on the whole and would have been a success in the actual thing. After supper to bed 12.30 am.
