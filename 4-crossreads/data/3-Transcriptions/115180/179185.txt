<p>My dear Harry</p>
<p>Your two nice sweet little notes arrived safely, We are so glad you had a nice passage, and such nice travelling companions, you always seem to get near &quot;a bottle&quot; don&#39;t you? Marie and I both wished, we had, had our hats on then we could have walked with you, to the Station, in that case you would not have been too soon, never mind, dear, better too soon, than too late, I trust all was well, on arrival at Bulford.</p>
<p>Marie went up stairs and watched the train leaving,&nbsp; and so you were not altogether unaccompanied, any way, your carriage was seen and you were safely inside, we can see the train, quite a long distance from the bed room windows. We said poor Harry is now, out of sight, but time passes very quickly, and we shall have you, with us, at home</p>
