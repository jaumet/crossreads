out & waited for a Car. While I was sitting on a Seat alongside the Tram Line another Lady asked me if I enjoyed the Scenery & seemed anxious to know about Australia so I had a long chat with her, we joined a Tram together & told me about different points of interest while we were getting back to Town. The Journey to the Zoo is 21/2 Miles from Town & the fare is 2d & the return Journey 21/2 miles practically a Circle is made up through the Hills amongst beautiful Residences & Gardens. There are very few fences in front of Houses mostly Hedges, the same between the Houses. The Houses are built of brick & high off the Ground as I am told the White Outs are very bad in Durban. In Town & Suburbs a lit up with Electricity & look Beautiful of a Night
