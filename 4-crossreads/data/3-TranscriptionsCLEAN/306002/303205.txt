25.6.15Fri. 25th.  One of the boys on the beach was riddled with shrapnel this morning but the Drs. say none of the bullets struck a vital part & he will live, another shell exploded as it hit a stack of cases containing cigarettes, tobacco, etc. & I believe it lifted cases & tobacco & cigarettes into the sea wholesale, swimming was barred for a couple of hours in consequence.  I believe there were several lads hit, some say 15 were struck by one shell.  On the 'phone again at midday.  I have had a head-ache all day & am not feeling to bright on it.  At 4 o'clock this afternoon the Lord Nelson came up opposite us escorted by 5 torpedo boats, & fired 40 or 50 shots from her guns (heavy) she had a high elevation on her guns, so was probably firing at something across the Peninsular.  The Turks had the hide to try & drive her away with shrapnel.  Just before
