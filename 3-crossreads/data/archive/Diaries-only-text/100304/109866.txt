Slept in until nearly 10, it being Sunday. After breakfast met Colonel Hutchinson and two other Australians and caught a char-a-banc for the Forth Bridge. Being Sunday the city was quiet and the weather was very dull and lowering. The road soon ran into open country and the scenery was delightful many little glimpses of wood and water and the most exquisite shades of green in trees and grass. Reached the Forth Bridge, the height of which is very great and the engineering of it is not realised until you walk across. It is 1  mile from one side to the other and a double line of railway runs across. The enormous size of the masonry pillars and the thickness of the steel girders now becomes apparent. On the far side (we crossed from Dalmeny) is a little stone village with plenty of soldiers sailors and we dined at an inn there. The harbour towards Rossyth was full of ships of war and was an impressive sight. Returned to North Britain hotel for tea and after that walked round a bit. The girls are very goodlooking with lovely rosy faces and all the children are sturdy and rosy cheeked. Passed Arthurs Seat which was wreathed in mist and did not ascend it. Everyone has broad Scotch accent. Noticed boards up ?Land to few". A couple of miles takes you out among farms ? the place is charmingly pretty.
