And they deserve great credit for what they had done.
The whole day was a day of festivity and jollity amongst the men but it was exceedingly cold and the field was knee deep in mud. In the evening we had a very heavy fall of snow which covered the tents, ground and trees beautifully. This fact coupled with the brightly shining full moon made one think of a good old fashioned Xmas.
Dec 26th.Plenty of cleaning up in the wards after the Xmas Festivities
Have caught a very heavy cold.
Dec 27th.Decided to provide a surprise party on the farm people
We got a lot of foodstuffs to-gether filling a couple of sand bags with them we slipt over to the farm house with them Took charge of the house and with the assistance of Marie Louise spread the table with the things that we had brought We had a great evening and everyone thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
After supper Bill played his mouth organ and we had games which lasted until ten o'clock The priest came in, and he upset things for a few minutes We left the farmhouse and crossed over the snow covered fields and landed into camp
