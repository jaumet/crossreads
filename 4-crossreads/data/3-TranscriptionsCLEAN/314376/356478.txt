  
 167 just on dark when we arrived. 
 Out way lay through the village and along a sunken road (just in front of Hermies) before we reached the front line. We found some very nice dugouts waiting for us which had been built by the previous occupants. 
 The position was a very level one away in the distance and it was possible to see Courtrai which was in the occupancy of the Germans. We stowed our packs underneath a tree and left. 
 Unfortunately a shell landed amongst them and scattered them all over the place. It blew up also a young man by the man of Stringfeller. 
 It was snowing as we took over the trenches and the ground was covered.
