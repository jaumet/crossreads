<p>It is wonderful the work that has been done there, trying to make things do. The men are all very happy    &amp; everyone about tries to make it as pleasant as they can. Have a piano -  &amp;  one of the patients was playing beautifully while we were there. We had quite a nice time, &amp; returned to hospital in time for dinner. This afternoon Sister Murray, Charlie &amp; I went to see three Mosques. I shall tell you about them in next letter. We had a lovely afternoon, had tea in Cairo with Charlie &amp; just got back in time for duty. We were paid to-night but only 227 P. about  &pound;2. 4. 0. that is all I got last fortnight &amp;  I had to pay 98 P. nearly a  &pound; 1. for mess., so you see I have not much to spend on extras. Fortunately I have been taken out a lot. We are to get more soon. Are you getting my pay alright? Hope so. Just as I was going on duty who should I run in to but Fred Hutchings. He is looking very well. Out here one is delighted to meet anyone from your own country. We were both pleased to see each other  &amp; he is coming to see me Friday &ndash; afternoon. I'm really spoilt in this</p>
