 2.  but Ellis was done &amp; passed A.1..  Nearly all the Unit are going to France for Field Work but Ellis &amp; I are to stay here to help run the Hospital.  Our Unit are being replaced by C Class Men &amp; they are terrible.  There is not an A.M.C. Man amongst them.  Our Orderley is Paralized in the right hand &amp; fore arm &amp; can just write &amp; that's all.  Another cove is a Russian &amp; speaks several languages but can't write His own name in English, so he is not much use.  They are all very weary sick men but I suppose we will have to manage somehow.  It throws a lot of unnecessary extra work on to Ellis &amp; I but never mind we are here to work &amp; never grumble now. Well George, nothing happens &amp; as I have yet to write to Mum after a long day, I will wind up By wishing all the Porman &amp; Miles Family the best of wishes &amp; also Frootie &amp; Jack Lord.  Jack is an old Sticker.  I will try &amp; write to Him, just a few lines. Best wishes to all the Boys From Your Loving brother Harry X
