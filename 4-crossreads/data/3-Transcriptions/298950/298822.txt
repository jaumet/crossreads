<p>yours obediently, Sgd. Zimmermann Camp Resident<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sgd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Hauser&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camp Secretary<br/>German Concentration Camp, Liverpool, N.S.W.</p>
<p>To this petition the Camp Office never recieved a written reply untill 3 months after when we all found that it had brought a change to a certain extent in our treatement, some turned out for our benefitt, some however made our confinement still more unbearable.  So on September 1 1916 we wher informed through a notice on the noticeboard in the following strain.<br/>Scale of Rationes from September 1st 1916.  Each Man per day Bread 1&frac12; lb. Meat fresh 10 oz. Tea or Coffee 1 oz. Pepper 1/72 oz. Vegetables mixed &frac12; lb. sugar 2 oz. Salt &frac12; oz. Condensed Milk 1/20 of a tin Margarine or Jam 2 oz. Peas, Beans, or Oat Meal 2 oz. flour or Rice may be issued in lieu of Bread Rationes.  So our food got cut down, the first result of our petition, wich still got reduced in regard of Meat Rationes by 2 oz. per day for each Man in November.  During October we recieved a new Camp Comandant &amp; we all prayd that same wher better than the last one, for it wher impossible that same could be worse.  The former Camp Comandant R.S. Lands left, as per report in Sydney News Paper "On a Secret Mission to Hong Kong China &amp; Major Hollmann toke Charge.  We noticed also that mostly all superior Officers places wher taken Charge of by New Officers.  So the Camp came under a new Regime entirely from October 1916.</p>
