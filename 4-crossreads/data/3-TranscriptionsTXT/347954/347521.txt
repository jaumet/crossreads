The naval marines relieved our boys in the trenches on the right wing but did not do any so very good although no doubt we were glad of their help.  A very large number were wounded in the head, probably due to curiosity.  A humorous thing here today is the disregard shown by our men for Turk shells.  You see them in constant use for cooking as they provide excellent fire brands.  Also when 18 lb. shells burst in vicinity of camp area & bury in the ground an immediate scramble is made by our boys to get them out with pick & shovels.  Snipers are the one thing we mostly dread just now as they are safely ensconsed away in almost impossible places on the lookout for defenceless & wounded soldiers - our boys organize search parties & prod & search every bush & they have met with great success.
