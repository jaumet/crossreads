<p>They cooked us eggs &amp; feasted us splendidly. Many of them had been working with our chaps on shore taking off the wounded &amp; they could not do enough for us. At night we had church service by Dean Talbot, rather a good sermon for him.</p>
<p>Monday 31st. Had a route march to a country village about 5 miles distant. On arrival we saw the usual scurrying females &amp; pulled up at a caf&eacute; for a drink &amp; were supplied with German Beer no less. Then three of us went round to the school &amp; the Headmaster called them out to form up for me to take a photograph. Then I snapped them scrambling for backsheesh. The youngsters were highly pleased &amp; when we first showed ourselves called out Australia &amp; pointed to the map. Comparing them size for size they seem to be more forward then our youngsters. We carried on some kind of a conversation with the teacher by means of a mixture of Greek English &amp; French &amp; on him giving me his address promised to send him a photograph. About 9AM a German aeroplane flew across &amp; dropped two bombs on the French camp killing &amp; wounding a dozen. Luckily they missed our camp. We could first hear him &amp; then see him soaring up at a great height. We also heard it rumoured that the "Goeben" was sunk.</p>
<p>Tuesday 1st June. Reveille 5.30AM as we had orders to quit. We packed up camp &amp; had to carry the major part of our equipment to the wharf as the mule cart's</p>
