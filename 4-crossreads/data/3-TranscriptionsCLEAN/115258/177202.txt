 My dear Mother, 
 Just a little note which may beat us home if it goes by the railway. We have been having a very good trip so far; arrived here just after dark last night and I received a telegram from home & one from Aunt Katie, also a letter from Uncle Walter. Sounds very flash being met in Sydney with a car, but I hope you wont come down if the flu is on badly in Sydney. We have all been inspected by the Medical people this morning, but are not being allowed ashore
