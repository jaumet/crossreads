The railway line follows the canal which is in sight practically the whole way on the way to Moskar Moaskar camp, Ismalia [Ismailia]. A lot of ships were seen in the canal.
 
Notes in Lt Col Crowl's lectures.
A few important points.
At one point of the foghting round Gaza in the Infantry & Light Horse attack they sufffered a reverse with 15,000 total casualties. The allied troops have not on any account had a straightforward advance here if these 2 advances stunts all along have only been made by losses of men in gaining experience first to make  second attempt. The site where this camp is was the part of the canal that the Turks attempted to cross at.
