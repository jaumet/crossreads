<p>11/3/16   Go to the Citadel with Eric &amp; Freddy. Eric won't come down Joseph's Well. Go to Ezbekia Gardens for tea &amp; then to "The Kursaal" &ndash; vaudeville show. Eric shows his appreciation of the singing by comparing the singer with a man sharpening a saw. A dag of a show.</p>
<p>On the way back we went to Ezbekia again for supper, &amp; whilst waiting for a tram at Ataba-el-Khardi we saw a native marriage. The procession is headed by a score or two of youngsters then a torchbearer with a cage full of flaming material, then more natives &amp; then more torches &amp; last but  by no means least a bagpipe band, two drums, &amp; bassoon &amp; about a dozen youngsters with candles in glass globes surrounding the bridegroom</p>
