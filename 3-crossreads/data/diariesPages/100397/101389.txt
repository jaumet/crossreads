showing them to the crowd, the looters were assisted by W.A. Soldiers civilians and various small boys who were out to get as much as possible boxes of cigars etc were taken and cigars were handed round amongst the crowd, some of the windows broken would not have been touched had it not been for civilians egging the men on, One was a civilian wanted me to get some of the boys together and start operations on a butchery business then he said that once we had started the crowd would be able to join in, of course he did not say that the civilians would share the blame, but that did not matter much. Perth is rather a nice town far better than Freemantle, I did not manage to see Mary B. Northam is about 72 miles from Perth and is 20 miles from Northam, so I did not go up as I was short of funds, I visited the Musuem Art Gallery in Perth, they do not compare with Sydney ? at all. we sighted the first land today must stop now. with love to All heaps for Yourself Bet. from Your Loving Son C.G.P.

My Dear Mother. We reached Port Suez after a splendid trip all the way the weather was all that could be desired, although the last couple of nights on the ship were windy and cold we disembarked at Port Suez and then proceeded to camp by Rail. I was detailed off with five others to guard some of the Baggage which was left on the wharf and, in the evening we were able to take a walk round part of the Port. it is a dingy dirty little place at the mouth of the canal the town proper is about a mile away I did not manage to have a look through it but I dont think I missed much as the accounts I heard of it were not very alluring ones, I believe it is even dirtier than Cairo and that is not saying much for it, I arrived in camp, on Tuesday morning about 3 a.m. after a very unexciting trip Per Rail
