<p>March 19<br/>234.<br/>Evening.  A day of insistent rain and periods of shelling:  One of the morning's shells wreaked the house of the only Belgian in the village &ndash; the house of the Belgian M.P. and his two women, casualties, their dog.</p>
<p>Mail:  Literary Supplement of March 14, March 7's contains announcement of a new book of war verse by Gilbert Frankeau, writing tonight for it, will post it after payday, and enclose &pound;2 on account.  From Paris leave, out of &pound;20.18.0, 50 odd francs left.</p>
<p>A parcel today from Mother, sox, handkerchief and chocolate and pastes.</p>
<p>Bailleul, Hazebrouck, Reninghelst and all villages of back areas receiving an issue of shells.  Bailleul's great, stolidly beautiful towers may perhaps follow the towers of Dranoutre and Ypres.  Today reading awhile Verhaeren's "Belgium's Agony", it is a splendidly true book of a great man, and to place aside "The Letters of a Soldier" and Masefield's "Gallipoli".  Posted away home books of Synge &amp; Aubrey de Vere.</p>
<p>March 19, 20<br/>235.<br/>Back after wounding at the Menin Road, Lofty H. &amp; Sapper, and from Blighty arriving today Willie L. and Wilk.</p>
<p>236.<br/>On night duty &ndash; all A.N.S. &ndash; in hut:  station kept cleared on account of shelling so only four in, 10th and 17th Batt. chaps, dead to the world.</p>
<p>Talks of rumours of our shortly leaving the line, going out for a 16 days reorganising &ndash; one Batt. to be cut out of each Brigade, and then a big hop over stunt, to clash hard against the one we're expecting from the Boche.</p>
<p>March 20<br/>237.<br/>10.30 p.m.  Shelling Dranoutre, shells passing over and seeming to land there.</p>
<p>This morning a deep mist around the hill and Kemmel, up at six, the sun shining, and a clear sky.  Tonight a &frac34; moon in a deep sky.</p>
<p>Boche planes passed over about an hour ago.  Station empty.  Keeping clear owing to regular shellings.</p>
