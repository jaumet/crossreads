 Still at  Salonika  so no use posting this- Had Service on board our ship-   I do not know if this war has made men more religious or not, but it certainly has made them  think  more seriously-  I know I'm thankful to be alive-  & hope to find you little Mother as bright as ever when I come home,  but it's a "Long Long Trail" "The Balkan News" reports the death of Austrian Emperor &  says the Kaiser considers Salonika show to be another Dardanelles  We leave tonight for  Alexandria  at 6 pm & will once more travel the  Aegean  Sea, among the torpedoes-
