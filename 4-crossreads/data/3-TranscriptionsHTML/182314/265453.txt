<p>The trunk (with key), suit case and hat box which you authorised this office, on the 7th December last, to transfer from Messrs. Thos. Cook &amp; Son, Egypt were duly received here on the 31st ultimo and are now held in safe custody, free of charge, on your behalf. Inventories of their contents are attached hereto.</p>
<p>When required by you the three packages will be available on personal application or- if more convenient at the time- they may be expeditiously delivered to any address in the London area or despatched to any destination in the United Kingdom. If you are unable to inspect your property at an early date you are advised to communicate with this office requesting that it be opened and some moth balls placed therein as some baggage recently received from Egypt has been found to be infested with moths.</p>
<p>Messrs. Cook&#39;s account for storage, etc charges on the property amounts to &pound;3:18:4. This will be settled at an early date by our Chief Paymaster and a corresponding debit made against your pay ledger account.</p>
<p>This opportunity is taken of suggesting that if you have additional property warehoused at any point in this country you should authorise me to effect its transfer to this store where it would be held free of charge and immediately available whenever required.</p>
