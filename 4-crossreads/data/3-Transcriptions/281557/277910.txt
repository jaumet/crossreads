<p>Wednesday June 14th <br/>Trenches: wet &amp; very cold: on observation: a pretty good sniper is opposite us &amp; pots at the periscope when it goes up &amp; got very close at times: heavy bombardment round Armentieres &amp; Yres still seems to be going strong: we got a few shells during the day: Jim Marsland looked me up &amp; we had a good yarn: I took a "P" of Jim &amp; Bert: one of our aero's braved the elements &amp; went up &amp; Fritz sent some shots at him: F Poole came down for a few minutes after "stand down" &amp; had a talk: Told me that W Barham &amp; others had joined up the 18th so I must look them up when I go out.</p>
<p>Thursday June 15th  Daylight Saving<br/>trenches: we had to put our watches one hour ahead this morning as the "day light saving" started today: got a P.C. from J.B.J.: on fatigue 6am &ndash; 10.30 am building up a parapet: an aero' came up after tea but did not stop up long: a fair few shells of both sides kicking around: cold showery day: our guns bogged in all day:</p>
<p>Friday June 16th <br/>trenches: cleared up during morning &amp; turned out nice day with glorious moonlight night: plenty of mortar "strafe"during day &amp; usual shell "strafe": wrote after dinner: about 11 pm our guns gave a "demonstration" all round on the left &amp; we certainly have some guns: It looked well with all the guns flashing:</p>
<p>Saturday June 17th : The day they forgot to proclaim peace on:<br/>trenches: fine day: gas alarm on the left about 12.30 am but it did not get round our way: our guns shook him</p>
