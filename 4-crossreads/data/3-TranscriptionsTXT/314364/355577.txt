Thanks to the War Chest &amp; Comforts Fund, our stay here has been made very pleasant. Last night a Southerly Buster blew &amp; down came many of the tents. Luckily ours was well pegged down &amp; stood the strain. The mess tents were blown down &amp; we had Breakfast in the open air. I was rather disappointed at not getting a Letter from B.E. but I suppose they have been busy preparing for tomorrow. After Dinner we erected the Mess Tent. It rained almost all day &amp; made things rather unpleasant. We had a sing song in the Y.M. tonight, which passed away a very pleasant couple of hours. It is 9 o'clock now &amp; we are going to Bed to prepare for the  Great &amp; Glorious Morrow
