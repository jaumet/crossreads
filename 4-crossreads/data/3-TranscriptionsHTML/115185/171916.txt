<p>5 &ndash; see me &ndash; also Major Man &amp; Col McCheane came to see me on Xmas day. I went for a walk with Capt Davidson on Monday &ndash; to rest him after the strain of the past three weeks constant firing etc. He came to say goodbye yesterday and went with a very precious burden in his good ship this morning. I'll send Mother his letter to me from Imbros.<br/>I must stop &amp; go to sleep now.<br/>January 6. 1916.<br/>I must finish this letter now and post it. I am very well and have nothing to do now but rest. We do not know when we go away from here.<br/>I went to lunch on the Minnetonka two days ago &ndash; and Col McCheane gave me a heater for my tent. They are going to try to take me to Castros before we leave.<br/>Dearest love to you all<br/>In Australia or England<br/>From your devoted<br/>daughter &amp; sister<br/>Betha McMillan</p>
