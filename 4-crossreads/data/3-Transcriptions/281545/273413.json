<p>Institute where I bought some Biscuits &amp; Cake &amp; a Cup of Tea for 1 Franc.   I sat down to a Table &amp; enjoyed them afterwards it being 5 Pm (17 oclock) I went along to the Pavilion Picture Hall &amp; saw a splendid show which I enjoyed.   I remained there until 7 Pm when the show terminated when after having a glass of Stout I went back along to my friends for Supper &amp; a chat.   I left there at 9 Pm after a good time &amp; arrived back at Camp at 9-30, as another chum is using my stretcher until I return from Boore I made by bed up on the floor &amp; after chatting with my two chums in the Hut we all turned in about 11 Pm &amp; I had a good sleep.  Next day I did a lot of washing &amp; hung them up on a cord above the Fire Pot &amp; by evening time they were nearly all dry.   I received word in the afternoon that I would not depart for Boore until Sunday &amp; the other batch of Drivers learning the System there were not ready to return, so I was booked up at 8 am next morning 4 Pm (16 oclock) on the shunter &amp; at that time turned to &amp; had an easy shift of 8 hours finishing at Midnight.   Next afternoon Saturday I again obtained a pass for Poperinghe &amp; went in for a walk.   I had nothing to buy so</p>
