A busy street runs right alongside this Hospital & from our windows you can watch the traffic passing up & down the roads, this a very big & important city & I am anxious to get out & have a look at her.
28th. It is Sunday & very quiet, went outside in the sun the first time for a fortnight & found it very nice, as I was hobbling along the corridor a lady pulled me up & started talking about one thing & another & finally ended up by giving me an invitation to come out to her place when ever I could for tea & have a look
