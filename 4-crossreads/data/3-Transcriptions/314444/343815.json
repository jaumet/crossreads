<p>France<br/>21.9.18</p>
<p>Dear George</p>
<p>I received your very welcome letter dated the 10/7/18 &amp; very pleased to hear that you are both keeping so well.</p>
<p>I believe Auntie is very bad sorry to hear it &amp; I expect to hear the worst any day now.</p>
<p>Glad to hear that you still get your motor trips I have had plenty of late following the troops with rations only we have those big lorries. things are going some now &amp; Fritz is getting well paid back the americans are making quite difference &amp; they are great boys Something like our own boys and not afraid of Fritz our boys have got Fritz bluffed.</p>
<p>All the Originals are going home this week 16 are going from our company tomorrow &amp; by the time you get this letter they ought to all be home in Australia We expect to be going out for a long spell it is about time &amp; I can tell you they get the most out of the Aussies &amp; they are not getting a fair deal.</p>
<p>The slips of paper you sent struck me very funny I would like to have seen the finish</p>
