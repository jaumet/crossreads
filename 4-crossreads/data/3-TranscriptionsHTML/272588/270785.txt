<p>Monday 14 October<br/>"The first thing which I remember as an event in life was being taken by my nurse to the brow of Friars Crag on Derwent Water."  John Ruskin. Arrived at Keswick on Derwent water from Glascow, via Carlisle &amp; Penrith this afternoon.  Friars Cragg &amp; Castle Head, are spots glorious, both commanding views of Derwentwater &amp; the latter of the finest panorama I have yet seen in my life. The run down from Glasgow is great, crossing &amp; re-crossing river after river &amp; the colouring of trees &amp; bracken is glorious.<br/>Royal Oak Hotel.</p>
<p>Tuesday 15 October<br/>An all day trip to Buttermere &amp; Crummock lakes. This country the poets country is all I expected it to be &amp; I cannot say more. This trip is unique along the Borrodale Valley &amp; over the Honister pass, back via Devils Elbow.  One walks over the Honister Pass but it is well worth it. The hills crisscrossed with many waterfalls, red with drying bracken &amp; the colouring of the trees is magnificent.</p>
