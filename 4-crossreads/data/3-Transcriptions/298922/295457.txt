<p>Friday 11 May 1917</p>
<p>Time runs on &amp; we are still facing the Turksbut well entrenched &amp; Barb wire entanglements in front. Our daily bombs are dropped 1st by the Turkson us then our planes visit them &amp; do likewise. Did I tell you of the GAS practice, we have had marching through our own GAS FUMES wearing our Helmets, a suffocating experience at first, &amp; in appearance makes men look hideous. Some day I hope to be rid of it all &amp; back among Rabbits, Fires, Burrs Blowflies &amp; even Strikes. Saw 2 Curlews tonight which made me think of old shooting days <strike>with JOE</strike>.</p>
