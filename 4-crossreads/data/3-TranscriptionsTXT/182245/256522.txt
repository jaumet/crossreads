 JANUARY 1917 
 7 SUNDAY 
 Fine &amp; sunny. They called for six 
 volunteers to go for a warm bath 
 &amp; I was one. We marched about three 
 miles &amp; we had a luke&nbsp;warm 
 shower, but it was the most enjoyable 
 bath I have ever had. It was the 
 first bath - or rather the first time 
 I had had my clothes off for that 
 matter since the night before I left 
 Larkhill, ten days ago. Cleaning 
 harness and dragging guns out 
 into position ready to move off 
 tomorrow morning all afternoon. I 
 was on horse picket at night. Saw 
 an airoplane brought down in 
 flames in morning. Got lots of letters 
 in afternoon &amp; parcels, the first from 
 home for six weeks.
