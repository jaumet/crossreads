<p>21 May, 1916<br/>Romanai [Romani]<br/>We went out to the sea &amp; had a swim, it was near the old Roman sea port &ndash; seemed a fairly extensive city built - it was all in ruins, mostly buried.  I found a few old Roman coins not much good but quite curios to me.  My mare &amp; I had a good time in the breakers only she was frightened of them a bit &ndash; I got a letter from Bert to night but none from home. We are going out for three days to morrow, hope it will be a better stunt than our last one.</p>
