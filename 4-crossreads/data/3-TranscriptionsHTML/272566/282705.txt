<p>Thursday 15 November</p>
<p>Misty &ndash; Roads greasy.<br/>In the morning I had a run back to Remy Siding via Kemmel, La Clytte, Reninghelst and Poperinghe, returning by the same road.<br/>To Lindenhoek.<br/>At 8 p.m. to A.D.M.S. in Dranoutre via Lindenhoek and Daylight Corner.  Travelling without a light on greasy roads is by no means easy work<br/>Canteen opened today.<br/>Guns last night were carrying out a terrific bombardment.<br/>Amentieres can be seen from a hill close by.</p>
