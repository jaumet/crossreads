Our chap made anoth charg today clear the German from anoth trench , they still continu to come in , one fellow they question reckon Germani had control of the sea that England was near done , they reckon that Germani would win in August I saw plenti of their black bread tast it , it is sour heavi to the tast I would not care to eat it at ani rate .
