  
 Embarkation is now supposed to commence on Wednesday, & our day is to be Friday.  I think this is nearer truth this time. I am doing more packing on the strength of it anyhow. Have discovered Hanna (George) of Whiporie in the bell tent nearest the Hospital. One day he came up sick & with a temperature. I was called to have a look at him & a mutual recognition took place. He has been here some 5 weeks. Harold Clarence dropped in yesterday afternoon & I am to meet him at the Pictures
