<p>patron of this place. Lady Billairs however <strike>was</strike> is out of Clevedon just now.<br/>We had a very nice time, there were three of us. After tea we played cards untill supper time.<br/>Wednesday Oct 2.9.18 Clevedon.<br/>Raining this morning.<br/> We had to stay in all morning on account of the doctor comming, my left arm had swollen a little &amp; he put it down to the bandage which was first wound round it.<br/>This afternoon had a walk through the town, posted a few post cards.<br/>Played chess in the evening<br/>Oct 8th. Clevedon.<br/>Plenty of wind and rain.<br/>Went to the pictures this afternoon.<br/>Am getting tired of this place, it is too damp. All the Australians are being shifted on Monday to Dartford, it should not be so windy there.<br/>The wound is feeling sore lately, the sister has been rubbing it with caustic, this is done so that by keeping the flesh down allowing the skin to grow.</p>
