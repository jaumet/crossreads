Assisted by the 13th Light Horse, we pushed on after Fritz and a couple of days after entering Bapaume we found a solitary Hun hiding in the sugar Factory about 1 mile from the town. He told us that two others and himself had been left in Fremicourt to explode a mine on the X Roads, and they had decided to give themselves up.
He had set out alone to find us and having told the Intelligence officer, myself & 2 others were sent up with an officer and German Interpreter, to get them out. Armed with 2 Mills Grenades & our Rifle and Bayonet
