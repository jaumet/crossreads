Bay, Lions Head and the red roofed houses of Cape Town, I see nothing of the City, and so pass a quiet and rather a slow day.
In the afternoon mail is despatched to London & Sydney.  At midnight Roy & Alf return with great reports of Cape Town and its people.  A midnight meal of cakes and pastry is much enjoyed.
June 22nd
(Sunday)
A wet day!  Malteureusement!(?)
