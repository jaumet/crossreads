<p>9th.    Last night we were that short of men that every available man including all N.C.O.'s were down on the "ration fatigue" that is as you might guess carrying the Coy's. food from where the "limbers" dump it, &amp; include's water, &amp; etc.  There was also a welcome mail in last night.</p>
<p>Had a few big bombs over last night &amp; at "stand to" 5 oclock this morning, 3 of them lobbed quite close to my dugout &amp; I have a pretty severe headache this morning from the concussion of the "strafers"</p>
<p>I killed an enormous rat last night with a stone while waiting for the limbers the place fairly swarms with the pest.</p>
