July 12th  Glorious sunshiny day.  We went out to the Grounds again &amp; fell in behind the Artillery.  For once we were on the Ground before the14th or 15th.<br> \r\n The King arrived at 11.45.  His arrival was announced by the yells of the mob.  George had about a dozen Generals with him.   The Infantry gave their display first &amp; put up a very fine show.  Then came the physical culture crowd.  Part of ?em wearing white shorts &amp; the rest blue.  They formed up on the Ground in the shape of a St George's Cross.  The Artillery gave a very fine display.  As they were galloping off the grounds, the W.O. got thrown from his Horse.  Our show followed the Guns, but was very tame.  The King was talking to some Nurses while we got through our performance &amp; saw very little of it.  We got a good close view of him as he left the grounds in an open car.  Our Amb. Waggon got first prize as usual. </p> \r\n <p><a name=\"a5300098\"></a></p> \r\n <p>[Page 98]<br> \r\n Friday. July 13th  No bloomin? mail in yet.  Wonder where the deuce it's got to.  <br> \r\n Gee!

Then our Soccer Team played the 8 M.G.Co. &amp; lost by 6 ? 0.  Col. Shepherd &amp; most of the officers played Cricket.<br> \r\n Finished my weekly epistle to Lill, but it was a mighty poor effort.

The mob are going for a Route March tomorrow, but thank the Lord, the Sanitary Police are exempt.  Received a nice long Letter from Mrs Jack B.<br> \r\n Its about time we got some mail from Sydney.  Some of the Nightbirds\" are out on the track of a Piano.  The horses they had in the Amb. waggon bolted, &amp; they nearly came to grief.  Blanton was aboard, so we can look forward to a full account of it in this next issue of the Tattoo  <br> \r\n The Piano arrived after Tea &amp; we had a sing-song &amp; Buck dance in the Mess Hall.  It was quite one of the most enjoyable evenings we have spent for some time.</p> \r\n <p>Tuesday. July 19th.   We got going today for a Concert at an early date.

At this morning's rehearsal Orace fell on his sword &amp; got knocked out.  Capt. Howard fixed him up.  He said that Orace had a touch of hemmorage of the Lungs, so he must have got a nasty knock.

No mail in yet.  It's about time we did get some.  Fine, sunshiny day.  We had dinner at 11.30.  Fell in at 12 &amp marched down to Brig. H.Q. where we picked up a Motor Lorry &amp; got a ride into Contay.  The 14th Brigade were formed up into 3 sides of a Square.  Gen. Birdwood presented us with our M.M. ribbons.  We had to halt 3 paces from \"Birdy\", salute, then step forward 1 pace, &amp; the Gen. pinned on the medals &amp; ribbons.  One chap got the Serbian Gold Medal, &amp; another the Croix de Guerre. </p> \r\n <p>(Gen. Hobbes &amp; a big crowd of Heads were present &amp; Birdy shook hands with us &amp; said nice things.  Then he marched the Brigade past us.  Truly it was some day.</p> \r\n <p>Monday July 23.  Our Concert came off in \"the Tivoli\"  It was to have started at 7, but by that time there were only about a hundred in the Building.  This was due to some bungling son the part of the Y.M.C.A. chap.  The Hall quickly filled as soon as the crowd knew that a show was on.  Things went off very well.  After the Show the Y.M. gave us a Feed.  Jack Edgar, Ted Jane &amp; Toby Barton worked very hard all day getting the place ready.  Our new scenery looked very fine.<br> \r\n What's up!
