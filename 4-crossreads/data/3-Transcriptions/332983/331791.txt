<p>Their only worry is how to get out of fatigue work.<br/>The 90th Battery 60lb has got only one gun in action, she is firing away now.<br/>8/9/15<br/>Another night out last night. We had to furnish 4 four horse teams to move C Battery 56 Brigade into a new position  We had to report at dusk. Then the work began. The new position turned out to be at a place known as Pink Farm, away on left flank, I recieved this information afterwards. A guide met our teams at the origanal position, and had instructions to lead us to the new position. He had already been there three times that day. We started off and after a while wondered where he was going to, We were sure he was on the wrong road, as he was making towards our wagon line, but naturally thought he had found a new road, Eventually we landed at 1st Battery wagon line. That was the end of that guide. Anyhow we found the Battery position, and went back to draw ammunition, got four loads again went to the Battery, and found them all asleep. We then went back to our own wagon lines. It was now 12.25 P.M. We again recieved orders to be at old position by day break with four wagons</p>
