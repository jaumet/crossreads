<p>from the sand</p>
<p>17th Jan (Monday) Digging dug-out. Xmas comforts given out &ndash; mostly from Mosman people. A raft was overturned on the Canal today and 17 men were thrown into the water. One man was drowned. Another was in our tent tonight and the incident seems to have upset him. I was talking to some Engineers tonight and they were referring to certain "bonza" graves over the other side of the canal. One man says he intends taking a shovel over to unearth the German major and get a few curios.</p>
