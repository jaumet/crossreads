<p>The British White Ensign &amp; French flags are flying on all the forts &amp; government buildings.  It makes one sad &amp; gloomy to gase &amp; think how many thousands of lives were lost at this partecular spot a few years ago.  A few hundred yards above The Narrows, which is only about 2 miles wide is seen the mine field &amp; nets used by the Turks against our ships of war &amp; submarines.  After passing through the entrance of the minefield our escort &amp; leading destroyer left us &amp; wished us a Merry Xmas.  We proceeded on our own up the Dardanells &amp; up the Sea of Marmara &amp; arrived off Constantinople at 11 p.m. &amp; dropped anchor for the night.  Fine weather prevailed rather cold.  Hills all covered with snow.  Temperature 48&deg; mean average.  The British troops that we embarked on the night of the 24th it appears they were kept on the wharf awaiting a transport ferry to bring them off to the H.M.T. Indarra.  Whilst there for hours they dozens of them were very drunk &amp; disorderly brought aboard in that state at 8 p.m.  Our Captain protested re leaving that night considering these men were in such condition &amp; in the event of anything happening useless to serve out lifebelts &amp; no boat drill &amp; send a letter ashore to the General Head Military Quaters &amp; also to the D.M.T.O. for further instruction.  The Signal came back by Morse to carry on &amp; proceed to sea immediately to the disgust of all sensable persons aboard.</p>
<p>25.12.18<br/>10 a.m.  Shifted our position &amp; anchored near a line of Battle Ships &amp; cruisers &amp; torpedoe boats &frac12; a mile from the Centre of the City.</p>
