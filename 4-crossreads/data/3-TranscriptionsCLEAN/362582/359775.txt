  
 Norman this day, he wants me to take a party of sisters out to visit their camp. Matron Cornwall is much better & has gone to Alexandria for a rest. I see Sister Murray every day but we cannot go out together, because our time off is different. She was very good to me Saturday night, getting sodi-bi-carb & hot water for my bag. She stayed with me until I felt better. I also took a hot brandy, which soon fixed me up. Dorothy was out & when she came home, was very surprised I was not well. She is getting quite fat and is very happy - this love affair does not worry her like the other. She is a hard-case and when Connsie Murray & she get going it is awfully funny, they have me in fits of laughter. I get letters from Mrs Barrie often, she is a kind old dear & her sister writes awfully kind letters & sends papers. So glad to hear you are having some visitors, it is very lowly for mother
