<p>humble servant. During dinner Crudge comes in &amp; he &amp; I spend the afternoon together walking along the banks of the Scardon for a long way &amp; return to town passing on way a very old church situated on a hill very much above the street level.</p>
<p>We then tried to ascend to Lower of St Wulfram but found permission has been barred by the English authorities who always seem to be interfering where interference is least justified. Then finished up at Elat where we dined 4 fr. Elsewhere in town dinner costs 10 to 30 fr. These EFC are the salvation of officers who otherwise would have less money than they have now.</p>
<p>After dinner I visited 43 Rue de la Caseine looking for Crudge &amp; after to Green shutters but he was not in either. I visited Bar of Hotel de la France &amp; had coffee though there is no dancing here to night as is usual. Finally at about 12.30 am I went to Club &amp; was given a bed (2 fr) in the long dormitory called annexe.</p>
<p>2-3-19<br/>Have made arrangement to meet Melhuish at 10 am. I rise fairly late being Sunday have finished breakfast by 9.30 &amp; spend the time upstairs &amp; talk to a WAAC who is cleaning up the room. I tell her that I must meet someone at 10 &amp; she laughs outright &amp; tells me that it</p>
