  
 "Quaker Girl" 
 Come with me  Come to the ball Music & Merriment call Golden & Gay are the lamps above Every tune is a song of love Ladies that come to the ball I am in love with you all Each has a part in my heart At the ball  At the ball Come to the dances while you may Flowers & Romance fade with the day Come in your beauty fair as a rose Dancing's a duty everyone knows 
 A Long Long Trail 
 There's a long long trail a winding Into the land of my dreams Where the Nightingale is singing And the White moon beams Theres a long long night of waiting Till my dreams all come true Till the day when I'll be going Down the long long trail with you
