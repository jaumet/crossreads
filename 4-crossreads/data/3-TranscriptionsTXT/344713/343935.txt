 Fri. Feb. 9th Went back to support tunnel for 24 hours. Received letter &amp; parcel from Mother. 
 Sat. Feb. 10th: - In line again &amp; the raid came off tonight. Our Artillery failed to cut the wire entanglements on the Maze trenches, although they have been ranging the guns for the past few days &amp; our chaps could not get through. Kerrigan, Turpenny, &amp; Brinkwall &amp; two others wounded. The raiders were rigged up in white gowns, steel-helmets whitewashed &amp; also breastplates. This was in order to match the snow-clad country. We had a good nights work out mending all the 'phone wires after the artillery had finished their performance.
