<p>[Letterhead of Australian Light Horse Camp, Ma'adi, Egypt]<br/>Sunday night<br/>10/1/15</p>
<p>Darling Mum Nance &amp; Joan<br/>I got your letters of the 6th safely, &amp; was overjoyed, they were the first I'd received. I got one from Jane at the same time. I've written to Jane Aunts Leila &amp; May, &amp; Uncle Edwin &amp; Aunt Lucy tonight &amp; this is my next, Doin' meself proud &ndash; aint I? I hope you got the cable Charlie Bean &amp; I sent. Uncle Edwin will have telegraphed it on to you I'm sure, saying that the two Jacks Harry, (Butler) Duncan, (Maxwell) Charlie all well.</p>
<p>I never knew Charles had come. You only told me about Jack (until this last letter) &amp; one Sat. afternoon after we had come in from a long ride to some caves &amp; were grooming our steeds I was called to the head of the lines, &amp; there stood Chas. I turned four sommersaults, got up &amp; threw 7&frac34; fits, turned one sock inside out, then after smoking 194 cigaretts I finally recovered saying, "Hello Charlie"! in four gulps. ie: one gulp to each syllable. But really I was surprised.</p>
<p>Well we straightway went into Cairo &amp; Chas shouted a swell dinner at a swell Hotel &ndash; The Grand Continental. We strode around the city afterwards not like this [arrow pointing to two well drawn figures striding along] but quietly, &amp; after we had sent the cable we went to the hotel &amp; had a game</p>
