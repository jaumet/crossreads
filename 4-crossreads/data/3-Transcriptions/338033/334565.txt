<p>Governor House, lighthouse.<br/>Showed us a plant which dies immediately you touch it and called touch me-not. The natives are always chewing to make their gums hard. They take a bettle leaf, and put a piece of Arica nut and some lime which makes the gums a dark red. We took a ride in the tram which costs 5 cents to go three sections, equal to one in Sydney.<br/>I noticed that the separate classes of trade were kept to their respective streets, but nearly every second shop is a fruit shop. The streets in the main portion of the town were very clean with rick &ndash; shaw stands just as we have cub stands</p>
