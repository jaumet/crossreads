<p>From Mansfield Station I caught the train to Pleasley village, from the Terminus I walked to Pleasley Vale a distance of about 3 miles.</p>
<p>I took Uncle by surprise, I had not written to tell him to expect me &amp; when I walked into the Post Office &amp; told him who I was he was very surprised indeed. Auntie was very nice &amp; made an awful fuss of me, she dragged me around to see everybody at Pleasley Vale. Later on I saw Cousin Tom &amp; Lily &amp; Wilfred and I was also introduced to Mr &amp; Mrs &amp; Miss Robinson, Cousin Lily's Mother &amp; Father &amp; Sister.</p>
<p>At night I went to a Social &amp; played wist most of the time with Uncle John, Mr Robinson &amp; Cousin Tom</p>
<p>The following morning I did not get up until about 9 o'clock. After I finished breakfast I sat by the fire talking most of the day. Toward evening Uncle Fred came over from Clipstone Camp to see me. He is working for the Army &amp; Navy Canteen Board in the camp there.</p>
<p>Uncle Fred is very nice &amp; jolly. He could not stay long so I went back with him</p>
