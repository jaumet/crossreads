<p>course they were terribly surprised) with the result that the whole hut was squirted with a most evil smelling liquid, which succeeded in getting into our lockers and staining our clothes.</p>
<p>When we turned in that night only a few of the vermin attacked us, but the awful smell of the stuff prevented us from sleeping.</p>
<p>These vermin I understand breed very quickly, I should imagine they do as in a few nights they were as bad as ever , but we never complained again, we got used to them, but the awful smell I&#39;m sure we could never have stood again.</p>
<p>The next day I&nbsp;was put on &quot;fatigue&quot; duty. This was a job which required the utmost vigilance on my part. I had to clean-up round an officer&#39;s tent. Only just round one small bell-tent. During the whole of the day - from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. I succeeded in picking up no less than six cigarette buts, an empty match box, and a couple of pieces of paper (one was an unreceipted bill I fancy). I had to carry the rubbish in a sand-bag and tip it into a box some hundred yards away. Most of my&nbsp;time was taken up by springing to attention and saluting the many officer friends of the one which occupied the tent (I&#39;ve no doubt they all called with the one object, viz:- whiskey). I didn&#39;t get one myself, but I often got a whiff of it as they passed out.</p>
<p>Of course this job got me thinking again, wondering what picking up cigarette-buts etc. had to do with slaying the enemy. I&#39;d had no drill at all so far.</p>
<p>One afternoon my wife and daughters called&nbsp;at the camp, so I naturally wished to show them over. Will you believe me I went to no less than nine officers for permission, and not one of them seemed to know if it was allowable. The last&nbsp;one I saw however, said that he didn&#39;t think it was permissable, but that if he were me he would take the risk and show them around. I did not. I didn&#39;t want to be crimed.</p>
