<p>41<br/>A Division of Grenadier Guards went through to-day, they looked fine.</p>
<p>26/8/16. Left Canaples for Rubempre at 10 am per Motor Lorry. No billet there for us so had to turn to &amp; build one with a large tarpaulin. It turned out very cosy I slept on the table.</p>
<p>27/8/16 Sunday.<br/>Rained nearly all day, called to see the petite fille of the Estaminet. Went down for the mail after dinner &amp; was lucky in getting 6 letters &amp; a parcel containing cake &amp; sweets. Spent the evening singing hymns it was great.</p>
<p>28/8/16.<br/>Left Rubempre early &amp; are now quartered in our old billet at Senlis.</p>
