<p>Dear Vol</p>
<p>I got your note and papers re election &amp; will do all I know for you tho' opportunities are not very frequent.  However, I think &amp; certainly hope you'll do the heck this time.  There's no doubt that the Hughes mob isn't the thing, in fact, I think that theirs is a very fair sample of dirty politics.  Yes, I voted <u>NO</u> not from your influence or anyone elses but because I know.  My old man tells me he voted Yes because by so doing he is sure to get me a spell home.  What blithering rot.  Anyway Hughes' scheme has come the proverbial gutzer (to which it was pre-doomed) and after all the old hands <u>are</u> getting home for a spell.</p>
<p>I got a letter from George who has by now joined his unit.  I should like to see him and will do my best to look</p>
