 Friday 15th Dec. More rain & cold weather. Mud now as bad as ever except when we are using boarding to walk on. One man had a narrow escape. He walked into some mud & found himself sinking, probably into a shell hole into which the mud had run, and before he was rescued by 5 of our chaps, only his head & one shoulder could be seen, another few minutes & he would have been finished. Walking at night off a settled track is impossible & even when on boarding is very risky. The only way possible is to wait for the gun flashes, take a few paces & then wait for the next. Had a case in last night where the femoral artery could be seen beating in the wound, being missed by a hairs breadth. Had it been cut death in the case would have ensued in a few minutes.
