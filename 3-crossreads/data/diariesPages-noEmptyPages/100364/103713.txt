Johnson my indispensable batman who swears and speaks amazing Arabic, kept the army of small boys which followed, in our wake, at peeping distance.

We stopped at the old Crusader tower at Ramleh on the homeward journey, from where there is a transcending outlook over the country. The run through the budding orchards, lit by the low evening sun to Dieran is always fresh and pleasant. I exposed 20 plates and took 600 feet Cinema film.
