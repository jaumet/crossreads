<p>Monday 12 June 1916<br/>A wintry day with no sunshine &amp; drizzling rain most of the time. No early morning parade but at &frac14; to 9 the exams in the ground covered during the school were commenced. Nothing very difficult in them &amp; got a "Very Good". The squads of men were not completed until nearly 3 o'clock when we fell in &amp; moved off to the firing line near Fleurbaix. It was drizzling as we marched out &amp; the slush &amp; mud on the cobble-stone roads made marching heavy &amp; difficult. Met Capt. W. Hindmarsh (Vet. Sci.) en route. At Fleurbaix picked up a guide from Bge. H.Q. &amp; was taken thro' the shell zone to the start of the communication trench, &amp; here again the walking on the slippery wet duckboards was very heavy &amp; difficult. At one spot we were stopped by an artillery observer because the enemy were shelling the commun'n. trench further along. It was abt. a mile over the duckboards &amp; then we suddenly came upon the front-line breastworks arriving abt. 6.30. After tea went out into Noman's Land for a little way, but awfully wet &amp; muddy. Raiding party meant a bombardment &amp; standing to. Received Aust. mail.</p>
