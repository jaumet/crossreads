Burgomasters where the billeting party was living, consisting of a Major, & 2 S/Sgts.  With the help of a violin we had a singsong, the old chap providing cigars, wine, coffee etc, a very fine family.
Friday 20th Dec   Slept until 8.45 & then had breakfast at the Burgomasters also dinner, they adding extras to our rations, as extra vegetables, & beer coffee & pastry so that we did well.  After breakfast I inspected the billets getting them to give me more room for the store.  At 3.30 the crowd arrived having had a little lunch on the road & then we gave them a hot meal at 4 P.M.  Having great difficulty with the rations coming forward & we only just managed to get tomorrows rations at 11 oclock at night.  Had a good evening in our mess, it containing a piano etc so is very comfortable.  More rain & cold.
