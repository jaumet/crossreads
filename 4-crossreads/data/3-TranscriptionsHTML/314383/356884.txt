<p>to be very friendly.</p>
<p>June 9th<br/>15 miles today, morning cool afternoon dusty.  Found it hard to pitch camp in the wind.</p>
<p>June 10th<br/>14 miles good camp.</p>
<p>June 11th<br/>Arrived Zenjan 18 miles absolutely done.  This is a very pretty place nestling in a valley.  We are camped in an orchard of a big place on a hill overlooking the city.  The sight of trees a wonderful relief after such a tramp thro a treeless country with only barren mountains on either side of the road.</p>
<p>June 12th<br/>Breakfast in bed, what a treat, rested all the morning.  Scotty &amp; I went into Zenjan in the afternoon.  Usual bazaars tho their lingo beats us.  It's more</p>
