  
 regularly now? Of course you knew I altered it from 2/- a day to 3/-, didn't you? They may even be making the mistake of paying the two lots, though I think they are too fly for that. Should I get wounded and sent to Hospital, I may have the luck to get to England, so don't be surprised if you should get a cable saying to send me a "couple of bob". I would like to go there, as I have an open invitation to Tommy's place, it would be a good idea to go there when I'm convalescent. Golly! I would like to see his cheerful dial again. 
 Well, Mother dear, I'd better turn off at the meter hadn't I, and I shall probably send you a cable just before leaving for the "fun" though of course if I'm broke (& quite likely too) I won't be able to, but in my case don't you worry about me one bit, I'll be O.K. and remember - KEEP SMILING . 
 With Love to all the family, - and OTHERS (Hazel will do that part!) 
 Your loving son
