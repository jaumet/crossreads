At 9.30 am the Battalion moved off, followed by transport and cookers and marched via Millencourt . Troops in fighting order and the band playing. Little Chretian and her beaupere were out in the street to see the soldiers go by. A pleasant day and the country looked so soft and gentle with neat groves and the rolling undulations.

Formed up the battalion in bivouac formation in the rear of the paddock and piled arms, blew cook house and had a picnic lunch. On the side of the field nearest the Chateau rose a wood and a high grassy bank which formed a natural grandstand. A boxing stadium had been erected in one place here. The sports commenced after the other battalions had in turn arrived.
