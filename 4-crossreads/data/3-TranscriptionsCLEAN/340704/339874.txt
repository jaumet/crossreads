  
 November 1917 Sunday 25 Still camped on side of hill near Saris. All very tired after yesterdays stunt. Col Todd had us road making and shifting stones. His pet mania is road making. 
 Monday 26 Still camped on side of hill in Enab and Saris. Got ready to move  and when we came back from water orders were cancelled. Very cold.
