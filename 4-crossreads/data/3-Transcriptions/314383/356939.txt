<p>Resting today.  Cholera is raging amongst the people &amp;   Many of the women come along in the morning &amp; afternoon to the Dr. ? (myself) established quite a reputation as such since taking the two girls in hand,  their wounds now clean but the poor unfortunate shot thro the shoulder looks terribly ill.  Gave the women one or two pills according to their size, look at their tongues &amp; feel their pulse beforehand. The poor wretches have implicit faith in us.</p>
