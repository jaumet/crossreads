Plenty doing with fresh admissions etc. All patients much the same. A few of the better ones sent to Blighty. They all go ultimately from this ward all them being serious cases +& taking a long while to recover  Mac & I walk to Wimelle & stroll around the pretty lanes  Generally too tired to go far. Sleep generally from 8 a m to 4.30. p m. or at least try to. There are too many noises & distractions to sleep soundly in the day
