  
 July 1917 in at the baths for a swim finishing up with dinner at the Savoy.  There is nothing much to do here in ones spare time.  The picture shows are rather poor, so there is not much left but read & sleep.  Got my mail posted up to date & letters answered. 
 Tuesday 10th to Tuesday 17th On Tuesday morning Sgt Gurney & myself got our week's leave & caught the 10 oclock train to Cairo getting there shortly after 1oclock.  We went to the National Hotel & got a room there.  Had a splendid dinner & then went to reacquaint ourselves with the town.  On Wednesday afternoon we went out to the 14th AGH & saw Sister Holmes, Sister Parker & afterwards took Sister Holmes for a drive around Cairo & Gezireh in a car.  Saw Lieut Alford at the hospital & had along yarn with him.  Quite a number of the boys are going back to Australia tomorrow.  Stan Rogan being one of them.  On Thursday after lunch we got a car & picked up sisters Holmes & Cuthbertson at the Hospital & after doing a little shopping we had a nice drive out to the Barrage
