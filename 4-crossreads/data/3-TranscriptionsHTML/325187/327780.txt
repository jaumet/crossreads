<p>We seem to spend a lot of &pound;. S D. nearly all goes in Tucker <strike>but I'm not in debt like many Officers</strike> Cairo was an expensive place.<br/>Here in camp there is no amusement when Patrols &amp; Field Days are over, tried to buy a Football but there was not one in all Cairo.<br/>Talking with a native who spoke English today he wanted to know how long the mares reared their foals as our Horses were so BIG compared to Egyptian Horses.  The Arabs have a custom of carrying their foals in their arms as soon as born &amp; then the Colt is never frightened &amp; knows the smell of a man.</p>
