  
 14 January 1918 Monday. Much Wine is distilled here & Oranges are cheap & plentiful   The Jews sell us eggs, & Bread & Cake sweetened with honey- Many Vineyards & plantations of Gum Trees & Poplars.  Naval Guns bombarded Turks all last night, the Enemy only destroyed bridges & works of military value & left all their Camp sites in a very sanitary condition, we have captured a lot of Waggons, ammunition & Stores- but wood is still the great difficulty- At night Jackals come from the Judean Hills & make cries like a pack of Dingoes
