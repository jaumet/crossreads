 Sorry I can't send you some some medicine for your growing plumpness that you complain so much about.  I fear it myself lataer. 
 14th Field Ambulance A.I.F. France 
 24.8.16 
 My dear Mrs. Jack, 
 I have just got your letter of 24th June &amp; sit down straightway to answer it for several reasons, amongst which is the fact that getting letters has made me so chirpy &amp; bucked up I must find an outlet somewhere &amp; work off generated energy in this way and also I must at least correct one very erroneous impression you have of me but more of that anon. 
 Of course this all implies how delighted I was and [indecipherable] to hear from you,  letter  for though I have been most exemplary in writing since I left Australia (a feat for me indeed wonderful) instead of being overwhelmed with correspondence as I should have been I have scarcely got any letters at all so that quite beside the delight in hearing from you the receipt of a letter itself is quite an event, either the P.O. has been to blame &amp; I must say that the Military P.O. is the last word in ...ness &amp; badly needs setting straight, an augean task, or else ah my former friends have learnt my sticky past &amp; seek to discontinue my acquaintance.  I shudder when I think that it may be so. 
 You say that even the minutest details of one's life is of interest to you, it is well for I'm going to give you a lot of this, but I should like also to take you to task for not letting me have more of your news, you said scarcely a word of yourself &amp; did not even mention John &amp; the son 
 [Comments in margin.] Oh yes!  What a greedy little pig you paint me when we first met of which you say have a memory, I spoke not from gormandization but from sheer absolute timidity &amp; awe &ndash; true bill.  I may not seem so to you now, I am still but try to mask it. 
 [Comments written across letter.] Please tell Mrs. Bettington that the Blanket bag she sent me is the envy of the Ambulance, I find it quite invaluable, its my most precious possession.  This will give you a puzzle to solve.
