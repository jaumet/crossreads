 Wednesday 1 December, 1915 
 Our lads again assulted by the Malitia, they were pelted with shrapnel from a bridge that runs across the road, one man had to go to hospital. 
 They are afraid our lads will run amock so they are sending all the fit men away in the morning. 
 I went into Valletta to see if [indecipherable] was still at Cattinca hospital&amp; found that he was so I spent the evening at Pieta &amp; slept at the Hotel De France &quot;on tick&quot;.
