  
 Dear George, 
 This is a real pretty place. It looks just like a picture. The road leading to the Right leads to Bulford. I can hear the New Zealanders going toff to the fron. About every week a couple of thousands go off to the front from from Sling which is about half a mile from us. No Australians are camped near us. They are all around the plains. I will write a letter to you George when I come back from London. Love to Lil   &  yourself from Harry
