  
 February 9 And fatigues to up, & fatigues come down, The duckboard track to the line, Ten men go up, and six come down, The duckboard track from the line. 
 Huddled shapes four, On the black-smudged snow And a broken track to the line And the wind tells a tale That is whispered low, Of a duckboard track to the line. 
 150. This afternoon, searching for a Venus pencil in Ballieul, some wounderful Brussels lace in one of the square shops & a half hour spent there, my eyes are bad, the lace's exquisite designs half lost in a blurr.  Bought "Guy and Pauline" (Mackenzie 2.50).  I've read it, but it's worth the re-reading, also in a deluxe harlot shop Mais' "Shakespeare to O. Henry" - the 1st edition, 10 Francs. 
 Tonight in the Rec. Hut a concert, Vin S., George D. and others.  George down for the evening. 
 151. Today I'd my desire of the last month, but the result not up to expectation.  When he joined the unit at Bois St. Julien, I noticed him before all the others, today after dinner in the Rec. Hut I made a rough sketch, when I've good pencils & paper, I'll do him again.  A fine star night. 
 February 10 152. Again no mail. 
 Read awhile Mais' "Shakespeare to O. Henry", of Masefield & The Modern Novel, Stage & Poetry, a good book for occasional reading. 
 153. Yarning this night with Basil, of "Gheitz" our new-born unit rag, it's to be suddenly, and without warning, laid in an unsuspecting ambulance.  Frank to do the Colonel for [indecipherable] page, then overleaf an "Old Song", of Brasse, so to Basil's satire "A's", to personal notes and Decoration to Bob's socialistic note to a verse (149) and a finishing sketch of "Bailleul". 
 Tonight we blocked out all the matters:  tomorrow printing and composing starts. 
 Supper of Welsh Rabbit, Toast and Beer, to an arguing on syphilis and its permancy under the present social order of things. 
 Frank S. has from Paris a fascinating 'City Plan' - full of tiny sketches of lovely buildings:  and long boulevards.
