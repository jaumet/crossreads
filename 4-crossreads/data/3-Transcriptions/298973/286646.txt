<p>White or grey tint. The public buildings near the water's edge have long imposing colonnades and piazzas, cobbled squares. The hills rise to a height of 1200 feet almost from the wharves, so that quite a big portion of the town is situated on the hill side.<br/>Vegetation is singularly absent. On the crest of many of the hills are lookout and wireless stations, while a fortified position is visible once you enter the harbor. In the bay lay the first armoured merchantman I have seen. These boats are most formidable looking ships, with their 4.7's, maxims and torpedo tubes. They are well manned and like a warship are painted that drab gray.</p>
<p>We soon had the regular flotilla of small Arab craft around us.<br/>In the Australian Tommy they found a soft mark for their cheap goods, I am afraid.

The result of the Ghurkas' expedition I have not heard; perhaps you have not heard of this little episode? Our chaps would have given anything to have got off for a cut at the enemy, but had to content themselves with thinking what they would have done.</p>
<p>At 2 am on the 7th we drew out of the bay and passing through Bob-el-Mandeb entered the Red Sea. It was as smooth as a plate of glass and as hot as blazes. We soon ran into a slight warm breeze &ndash; I think they call it the sirocco &ndash; which carried quite a quantity of dust and hordes of great red locusts. These are like our</p>
