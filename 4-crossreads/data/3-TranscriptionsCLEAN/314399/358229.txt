Played rummy for about 3 hours after dinner. The nigger who challenged any body on the boat has been matched for s aside. Have 1 on the unknown with Dal. Some slight trouble with the guard last night. Lent my colt to Cooper in case of trouble with the guard. 
 Thursday 21 August 1919 Sea absolutely calm all day. Thick mist about too. Passed a couple of boats. Played cards & read all day. Dropped anchor just outside Cape Town about 8 pm. A boat came alongside evidently with doctors & staff. Finished my long series of letters to Nettie. Was 24 pages.
