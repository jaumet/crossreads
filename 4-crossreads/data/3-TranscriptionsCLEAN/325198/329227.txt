27 January, 1916MaadiWe thought that we would we be getting away either to night or in the morning but after we came in from a full dress parade we were told that it was all off & we had to get our kit bags back & strip our saddles again - There is a rumour of us going away on foot again - goodness what will be next.  [Weary?] Walker (Lieu) took charge of our Squadron this morning, he let us stand easy most of the time.  This after noon it rained very heavily & water is lying every where - its beastly cold too.  Egypt is a dead queer place
