not going too well on the front. Braithwaite rang up that he could see A Coy coming back and an appeal for assistance came from Westaway. Presently McCartin wounded in three places rang up that A Co were not at the Crucifix and that he was in the air. Word now came that A Coy had been held up by M.G. fire and that Fulton and Evans were both wounded. Young Smith rang up and told me how matters stood and old Holloway the runner also came in. On the left Westaway's people seem to have been surrounded. Brazenor was killed ? so was Sgt Ellis of A Co. Armstrong , Westaway Mallinson are missing. The Boche was seen to march off
