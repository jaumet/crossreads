Dear GirlI landed all right & sent a letter card to you. It was hot, wet & slippery in Sydney & on G. Island - I went there at once to GI & reported & had lunch there. I then paid my mess bill up to Dec 1st & went to town. I went to Anthony's & bought your few things which I hope you & Mab will like - I think Mab's hatbox is A1. Green I think looked even better than the brown - It is 22 ins square - The tumblers you will need - also pepper pots - I had a strenuous aftern. I tried to get - "The riddle of the Sands" but could not - you might send it to me if practicable - I got Bernhardi's "The next  war" to study - I had dinner & to bed early -
Friday I was in uniform & off to the Fantome at 9 am - The crew are inboard & the buz is we go out Sunday night - 110-120 all told - We may but I don't think we shall - The 1st lieutenant  I've sent to Hospital for Appendicitis - so he cant come - a nice chap - Colton Stapleton - English & Kentish- I have a cabin - a Dispensary - a consulting room & a sick bay attendant - all small save the attendant - I'm not quite sure if he's the doctor or I am but no doubt our relative positions will turn up shortly - He's zany & positive & has had wonderful cures & is a Know-all but again fancy he must have weak points somewhere - We shall see -
