<p>Next night the 6th I was again detailed in charge of wiring party &amp; after a few minutes work in the moonlight Fritz stopped our job &amp; we had to finish for that night. Our next moved was on the night of the 7th when we went as far back as reserves &amp; from here we had to do front line ration fatigue which meant a trip at night &amp; one early morning. I came a very big thud on the 13th when I was detailed with right half company to go back in the front line to occupy a pill box known as Hall farm for 48 hours. Our duties here were outposts etc &amp; had to patrol to 2nd Battn on our left &amp; the second night in we had a very heavy snow storm. Next night the 15th rain set in very heavy &amp; after waiting a few hours we were releived &amp; it was one of the darkest night I've ever experienced &amp; I led a small party out &amp; had to wait &amp; collect gum boots at the brigade store. After waiting there till the small hours of the next morning &amp; only half the party had reported I took leave &amp; set off to find the battalion who had moved back to Wytschaete. After wandering about on my own for a couple of hours I gave it up till daylight &amp; turned in for forty winks with a platoon of the 4th Bn. About seven o'clock I got up &amp; after enquiring &amp; wandering for another hour I found my platoon &amp; found that half the boys were not home who were in the Pill box with me.</p>
