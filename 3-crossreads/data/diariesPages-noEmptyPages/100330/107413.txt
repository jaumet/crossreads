As we had fine weather for the past day or two the Aerial work by our aeroplanes was very interesting, all day long you could hear see our Boys flying in amongst the clouds now again in the distance hear their Machine Guns fireing. After Dinner I witnessed an Aerial Fight very high up, you could see two machines skirmishing about, one would climb up high the other following you could hear the Rat Tat, Tat, of their Machine Guns, all of a sudden one dropped down turning side to side the other following then came the chase up again as they were rising along came 4 more of our Machines the one who was leading of the two climbing slewed off was lost in a big cloud
