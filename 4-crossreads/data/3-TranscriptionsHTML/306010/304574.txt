The Sergts. are berthed aft in very comfortable quarters, &amp; as the tucker is fair, sea calm, &amp; little work to do now that the mass of work in connection with the embarkation has been got under, everything should be alright.<br/>Monday 27th March<br/>Everything going smoothly, the ship averaging between 11 &amp; 12 knots. So far we have only seen one ship since leaving Alex., the Hosp. Ship Ersiquibo which we passed about 9 o'clock last night bound for Alex. Notwithstanding the fact we are on a Hosp. Ship every precaution is being taken against enemy submarines. We are keeping well out of the usual trade route</p>
