<p>A most peculiar thing happened this afternoon in full view of us all Lieut Rowbottom of D.Coy hopped out of the trench and deliberately walked towards the German trenches &amp; they were only 80 yards apart, when he got half way over he stopped &amp; picked up a German rifle, then the expected happened for a rifle crack rang out but he missed him &amp; Rowbottom signalled a washout, then another crack &amp; Rowbottom spun round like a top &amp; collapsed, by this time nearly every man in the trenches was looking on, &amp; the next thing we saw was 2 of our stretcher bearers hop out with a stretcher &amp; 2 little white flags &amp; go over towards Rowbottom, we all held our breaths for it was a very daring thing to do for you all know what a rotten name the Germans</p>
