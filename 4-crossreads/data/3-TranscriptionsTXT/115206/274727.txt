Battery W.Lines.  near Pont NoyellesWeather beautiful. Received a packet from Mrs Felton, a letter.Very pleased to read that BIlling M.P. was acquitted. Seems there  is a sorry state of affairs in the English aristocracy. Visited and sang at a concert in the open, near 113th Hows [howitzer]  Waggon Lines. Quite a good concert, no lack of artists. Ran across Robbie, North and Theo Meillon. Smith arrived from Guns for the afternoon.Scottie Malcolm went up to the guns
