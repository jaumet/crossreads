<p>months.  Shoeing Smith Doust, rejoined his Bty., the 8th.  Concert by the thistles in our lines last evening.  Good entertainment.  Mostly professionals.  Saddler Sgt. Saunders gone to Australia.  He is a 1st Bty. Sdd. Sgt.  Struck a wicked mule, issued to us from D.A.C.  The Major stopped me from shoeing it;  Kick bite, and strike.  He said that he was not going to have men hurt, or waste their time on such things.  Took me half a day to put a pair of hind shoes on this mule.  The D.A.C. shod him in a pen;  they carry it with them.  When the Bty. get these brutes, you have to do the best you can with a piece of rope and a post.</p>
