<p>I am much better, going out every afternoon for a drive. On Friday I had my first outing for 7 weeks. Sister Rhoden, who came with us on the "Kyarra" accompanied me for a Gharry drive. It was a beautiful day &amp; we quite enjoyed out little outing. I was only out for one hour you can imagine how delighted I was to get out once more. On Saturday I went on with Sisters Hart &amp; Pilkington (also of the Kyarra) to Cairo Gardens &amp; had afternoon tea, getting back at 6 p.m. We had a glorious time. On Sunday (yesterday) I got up at 5.30 a.m. and went to 6 a.m. Communion. The room where it is celebrated is quite close to this room, part of the Officer's Ward. The Chaplain is a high churchman, anyhow it was a very nice service &amp; I was so pleased that I was able to attend. In the afternoon Sister Craig, Ralston &amp; self went for another Gharry drive along the Suez Road. It was a perfect day. Then Essie Craig &amp; I went to the Church Service (C. of E.) in the Shelter Shed &ndash; Quite a number of the Convalescent Patients</p>
