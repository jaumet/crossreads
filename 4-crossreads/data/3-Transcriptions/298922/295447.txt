<p>Bombed again. 1000s of acres of Crops are ready for the Strippers here &amp; we are eating it down by grazing Camels &amp; Horses, &amp; the ground has only been scratched by a wooden Plow yet bearded Barley &amp; Wheat are good. I have already told you of natural grasses but no Timber of any description &ndash; rolling open downs.</p>
<p>This is the great Revolution Day &amp; I wonder if the Socialists in Germany will show up the real feelings of the MASS of the HUNS &ndash; one would think the world was getting tired of WAR. Moved Camp again.</p>
