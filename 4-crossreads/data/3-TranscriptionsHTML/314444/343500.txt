<p>Dear Ivor,<br/>just a card to let you how I am getting on. I was in the biggest charge that has been at the Dardanelles yet. It was a sight I will never forget, there were thousands of dead Turks every where you went. We captured over one thousand, Turks in a couple of hours. I was wounded on August the 9th but not very searious a bullet through my hip. I saw Ted over there, he was wounded on the 6th<br/>From Horry</p>
