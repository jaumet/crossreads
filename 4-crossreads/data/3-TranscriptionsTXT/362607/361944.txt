Dear Mother & All,
I arrived home safely last Tuesday but it rained nearly all the way and I forgot my umbrella, perhaps Marie will bring it. Did the boys get off today. I am glad I saw them. I watched the boat but my word it was stormy will write a gain love to you and all, Your loving daughter  Hannah
