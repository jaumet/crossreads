29.5.15a shrapnel shell.  It fell within a few inches of Les Smithers leg during the night & right inside our dug-out.  A sniper winged Caban (H.Q. Sig.) early this morning while he was going for water.  They have been giving us a warm time also, & this afternoon a bullet went through Les' belt breaking a pouch & a clip of cartridges, it also broke one of the flag poles.  At 4 o'clock we received the order to stand to arms ready to move off at a moments notice, although heavy firing was kept up all the afternoon, we were not called out & received the order to stand easy about sundown.  This afternoon two bags containing parts of Turks, also 30 odd whole Turks were buried by our men, the results of bombs.
