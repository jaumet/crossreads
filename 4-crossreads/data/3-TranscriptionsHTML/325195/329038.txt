<p>14.12.15<br/>Tue 14th<br/>Was on duty from 2 oclock till 6 this morning; One of the sentries of the D Sqd. apparently had a touch of nerves last night as he reported that he could see Turks advancing &amp; seemed very excited over it, but as nobody else could see them we came to the conclusion that he only fancied he saw them;The Regt received orders today to burn anything we have, &amp; do not intend to take with us; apparently <strike>every</strike> all the troops have received the same orders as dense columns of smoke can be seen all along the line<strike> today </strike>men are busy on the beach today breaking up all old rifles &amp; bayonets &amp; throwing them into the sea, also saturating the heaps of old overcoats &amp; clothing &amp; any stores that are left behind with petrol apparently to set fire to as we are leaving; Everything very quiet. Bet the Adj. &pound; 1.0.0 that we would leave before midnight "Mon"</p>
