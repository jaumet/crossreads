number of destroyers & torpedo boats here flying around give one an idea of our naval activity.  Searchlights playing all night in the sky present a fine spectacle, the old Castle on the hill being silhouetted against the darkness beyond.  At 8 p.m. turned in for the night to disembark in the morning.  Heavy gale still blowing.  We sleep on mattresses right in stern (no blankets) & make best of it till morning.  Dead tired, I am not long going to sleep.
Nov. 2nd - ThursdayAwakened at 6-30 a.m. to dress & wash.  On deck & find the weather has abated a little.  At last after hours of waiting
