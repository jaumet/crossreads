Sunday 17 March
Very quiet on the front to-day up till about 5 p.m. when the Bosche guns began to speak in salvoes sent gas all round us. The attack is still in progress at midnight. Beautiful clear day, much aerial work a fine moonlit night. A view of the German line from the top of Mount Sorrel shows the town of Commines (?) (Warneton) almost intact the church spire showing out well.
Monday 18 March
Beautiful day but warm showing a slight tendency to rain. Fritz has shelled Hill 60 to-day all day with very heavy stuff the valley between us the hill has been covered with a smoke pall all day. It is the most vigorous bombardment of one place I have seen since Pozieres. The Gas is being sent over to-night in small quantities last night we had a carry through it. Heaviest gas attack I have seen but only one or two casualties were the results. I doubt whether the bombardment of Hill 60 caused many casualties.
Relieved to-morrow.
