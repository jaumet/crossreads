A Merry Xmas and happy New Year to all
Dear Mother
Just a few lines to let you know that I very near well again. I am allowed up and am walking about in the Hospital now. Now Every where I have been, and I have been in four Hospitals and 2 hospital ships, I have been treated so kindly and so well looked after
