 AUGUST&nbsp;&nbsp; FRIDAY 4&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916 
 Fine &amp; warm. I did a bit of signalling in morning but as there were only three of us, we could not get much practice so we had some practice as setting up the helio &amp; taking it down. Had some battery drill under English NCO&#39;s from the Instruction school.
