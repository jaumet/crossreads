Monday 
Xmas Day!!! In the field. Peace on Earth, Goodwill to Men. Man's answer --- the roar of guns ? in charge of death dealing shells. Christianity travestied. We are all let off fatigue as a great concession. Get dinner of mince carrot, with plum pudding custard. We supplement with tin fruit, tin plum pudding cream. Called up for duty at 5p.m. on evacuation. Several wounded brought down, extra activity to celebrate the day, No less than 4 poor fellows die within hour in dressing room. Thus was Xmas spent.
