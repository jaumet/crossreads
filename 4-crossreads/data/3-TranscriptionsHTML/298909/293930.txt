<p>16/3/16 Thursday</p>
<p>Very hot all day &ndash; Went for a route march &ndash; across the desert a bit.</p>
<p>Went into Cairo at night &amp; met two fellows from Enoggera &ndash; fly flats &ndash; they were going to show us Cairo, which they did with a vengeance, we finished up lost in a blind alley &amp; in a very poor delapidated quarter. All soldiers have to be out of Cairo by 9-15 pm &ndash; this made us late &ndash; so much so that we had to take tram out to Helliopolis &amp; walk across the sand &ndash; got home by 10 pm.</p>
<p>17/3.16 Friday</p>
<p>Very hot a dust storm all day &ndash; sand blowing about freely &ndash; very hard on the eyes. Never gave St Patricks day a thought &ndash; Have a very sore heel I strained a tendon a week ago at the Pyramids &ndash; comes against me marching</p>
