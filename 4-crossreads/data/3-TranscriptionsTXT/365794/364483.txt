 Friday 23 March 1917 [22 March 1918] Nothing worthy of note to report.  Life is as regards work, very monotonous but certainly not otherwise.  We are all going out enjoying life. At 6 p.m. S. Reed &amp; I meet Mr. Dowling &amp; J. Andrews &amp; go Pyramids for motor spin &amp; supper, very enjoyable it all was &amp; two dear boys &amp; what matters if we behave as children once more, eat our chicken like infants, have our fortunes told &amp; heads lean on shoulders &amp; arms are round one another in the car driving home?  We are men &amp; women but it is good to play sometimes &amp; they are two dear boys. Mr. Dowling goes up the line tomorrow, 9 a.m. Rockets are seen on our return journey reminding us that there really is a war on after all.
