Dear old Dad.
this morning bing was very funny first he took a boot then he would take a sook he was all the time getting sox and Anna said it was because his feet were cold. and wee have just finished breakfast. and mum has to go after sily bill. and mum is going to parranater and she has to hurry up. and Anna is real silly to day. and I wish we had a nice big fire in the house. and when I lie down bing jumps on to my back and I jump up and bing clings on to my neck and I run a long.
and I help mum make the bed. and bing is still real funny and mum has to feet Blucher now. and anna said she can find every think and I have just tied bing up. and I do not no wether I can write on
