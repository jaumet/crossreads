Marcinelle14/3/19At 9.30 addressed about 30 reinforcements on their duty to their Battalion and upholding its dignity and then wandered round to the Echo office. Colonel Geo. Murphy C.M.G, D.S.O was with us to lunch and afterwards came up to the University de Travail to see the finals for the Boxing Championship of the Corps. There were some good fights. At its conclusion General Rawlinson made a good quiet speech to the troops and said he was prepared to say publicly that the Australian Corps was the very best in the British Army. This naturally pleased the troops. At mess tonight we drank the health of the 6th Brigade as from tonight it ceases to exist after 4 years active service. Colonel Linton its first Brig. - myself the last. What changes. Tomorrow the 2nd Dvn Inf Group commences & the 6th Bde becomes a Battn.
