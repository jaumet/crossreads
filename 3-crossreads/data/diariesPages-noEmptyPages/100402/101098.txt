No cases last night in spite of heavy shelling on the left Battn. who were raided but took prisoners machine guns. Glorious weather. A raid by the 10th on our left is to come off to-morrow night. This Strazeele front is by far the most mentioned front on the line now almost every night there is a raid on. Our division has held it for over 80 days, a record I think.

Cooking to-day all went well until the evening meal when on a sudden Fritz opened a barrage of H.E. Gas shells. Nothing happened marvellous to relate there was not one casualty in the line. Great aerial activity on both sides to-day. No cases last night. Of course the Boshe Barrage upset plans for the 10th the raid is off.
