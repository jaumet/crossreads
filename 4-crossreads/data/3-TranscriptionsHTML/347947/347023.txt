<p>and after a little messing about with Kits and Baggage  we was soon on the march again to another rest camp about two mile through the city of bolougne  the french people are much like the Egyptians with their ways.  we arrived at the camp about 6 oclock same evening all camp in one large Hut for the night.  everyone was pretty tired after the long journey and slept well on the boards.  next morning after breakfast we were off again back the same way as we came up.  got to the station and after a lot of messing about again we boarded the train and was soon tearing along through some very pretty country for about 70 mile and after about two hours arrived at a large camp at a place called Etaples and only about 60 mile from the firing line.  there are hundreds of troops here all Australians some came from Egypt others from direct from Australia.  we arrived here on Thurs 8/6/16.  it's a large training depot for troops who have to do a course of training such as Bomb throwing.
