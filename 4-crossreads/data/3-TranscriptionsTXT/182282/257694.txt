Re Lt Kenneth Binnie
The Followin brief Summary of my
Father War Service were taken from
his 1916, 17, 18 and 19 Diaries
&nbsp;
At the Outbreak of War Dad was managing
4D. Alan had won a scholarship to
Wxford and the rest of the Family
(including Struan) had gone to visit him.
&nbsp;
Being a &quot;man of the times&quot; Dad was
extremely anxious to &quot;Get Away&quot; and
this was the subject of many letters
to his parents during 1915 beseaching
them to come home and relieve
him of his management duties so that
he could do this.
&nbsp;
January 1916 saw him finally get his
wish and he enlisted as a
Gunner in the 7th Field Artillery Brigade
which were being formed at &quot;the
Warren&quot; /Camp near Holsworthy Tempe.
&nbsp;
At the time he was courting my mother,
Linda Lloyd, who was a Sydney girl. and
Her family provided a welcome venue
for him on his frequent leave breaks.
Apart from leave breaks they looked after
their Horses, which were carefully selected,
cleaned the guns and Harnesses &mdash; which
he complained &quot;rusted while you
watched&quot;.
&nbsp;
The 7th F.A.B. embarked on the &quot;Argylshire&quot; for
England on 11th May - they had an enjoyable
&amp; less eventful voyage with plenty of
good companionship from North Western
