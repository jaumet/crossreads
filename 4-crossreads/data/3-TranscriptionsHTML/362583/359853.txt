<p>difficulty supply you with a temperature of 160&deg;, &amp; consequently you don't take much interest in the machinery in that part of the world, but prefer to try the lower regions, where the temperature was only 105 &deg; when I was there, but is now probably about 120 &deg;. The interest I took in things down there was marvellous. I stayed down there over an hour examining bolts &amp; screws, condensers, pistons, pumps, etc etc, all the time doing my level best to summon up enough courage to wend my way back through the second floor. It may sound strange but the coolest place down there is the stoke hold: if it was a bit more brilliantly lit &amp; there was a little less coal dust about, it would be a more pleasant place than on deck. To day, this is not the same day on which I started the letter, we have had quite a large supply of mild excitement. We've seen several boats &amp; several landscape views, but we have none of us yet had what we are all most anxious for &amp; that is news either of the war, or of what is going on in Australia. For all we know the Kaiser, with a minute "he" might be dead &amp; to put it politely, buried by this, but- questions we would like to have answered are- Is there a war going on in Europe? Are the Germans still in Berlin? How are the Australians doing? etc: but it is no use your answering them because by the time this letter gets to where we are going &amp; back again to where we left, the news will probably be stale.</p>
