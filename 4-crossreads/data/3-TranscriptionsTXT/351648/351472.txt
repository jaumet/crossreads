 Well as I said I got to London &amp; found out that I had been sent over  with the  for the purpose of taking part in a huge Investiture ceremony to be held by the King in Hyde Park but they [indecipherable] informed me that I shouldn't have been sent over, that they didn't want me!! that only V.Cs &amp; D.C.M's were wanted &ndash; they told me to wait till Wednesday.  What hardship!!!  How I protested??  (I don't think), so I waited &amp; on Tuesday I found I couldn't be due on Wednesday as they hadn't my name in to the War Office.  How angry I was!!! (smilingly) you can guess, as it meant that I'd have to wait another week still on duty, how horrible!!!.  I did &ndash; (my duty was to inspect Picadilly Circus &amp; Street, Regent St., &amp; all that part of London including many theatres &amp; Grill rooms).  Finally on Wed. June 13, 1917 at 11 a.m. I was presented to H.M. King George who hung on a medal, shook me by the fist &amp; in 2 minutes exactly by the Town Hall clock finished what I had waited 2 weeks for &ndash; oh! it was a costly duty
