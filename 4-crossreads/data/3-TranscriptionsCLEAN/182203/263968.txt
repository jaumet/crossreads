I'm in a fearful hurry but will start a long letter to you in a day or so to let you know all our movements. This is a magnificent Palace. It is a huge building, I shall try to send you a photo of the building. We are fearfully busy. I'm in the Officers Ward. & the poor fellows are awfully brave. You have no idea the what war is like, until you come here. Now I suppose you have heard that poor old Charlie has been wounded. He is here in Ward 4.A. I can tell you I got a shock when I saw his name on the list
