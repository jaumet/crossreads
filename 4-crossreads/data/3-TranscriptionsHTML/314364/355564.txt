<p>Mon.Mar.10<br/>This morning the sky is quite dull &amp; grey with low hanging clouds. The sea is very rough &amp; there are many vacant seats at mealtimes. The wireless operator is in touch with "Aussie" so that sounds as tho' we are nearing Home at last. Poor old "Poss" is still sick &amp; can't eat anything. Mr Morrison the ship's 4th officer is getting along nicely. He is a very nice chap to talk to. We only have seven patients in now, &amp; none of 'em are very sick. We ought to be on our final stage for Home by this time next week. Up to mid-day today from noon yesterday we only did 266 miles, so we are going very slow. Col. Barrett gave us a very interesting Lecture tonight on the "Origin of the Tanks." Browning our mental patient appears to be getting quite alright again.<br/>Tues. Mar 11.<br/>The sea is a bit calmer today, tho' the wind is blowing strong as well. One of the officers informed us that we were making good headway &amp; he expected we should arrive at Fremantle at about 8 a.m. Friday. I looked thro' my Gear today to see that everything is clean, as I don't want to arrive home with anything dirty. The W.A's are polishing up their Gear, ready for going ashore. Even now I cannot realise that I am going Home. I keep on thinking that I shall wake up &amp; find that I have been dreaming. I must send a wire from Fremantle to B.E. &amp; let her know that I'm nearly Home, so that she can get our Bag packed ready for the wonderful event. I need also try &amp; write a letter before Friday.</p>
