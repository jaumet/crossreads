<p>[Tuesday 15 August 1916]</p>
<p>Dr Fay Maclure of Hay is a M.O. in this Hospital had a yarn with him today.  Heard today I shall be sent to England to finish my "cure" so as you get this I shall be on the sea.  I have had a Mauser bullet, a bomb &amp; a Shrapnel shell.  I have yet to be torpedoed.  We have some bad cases in here-  Poor old Major <strike>Shanahan</strike> had his leg taken off- "there goes a good rider" he said.<br/>My kit Mufti was sent from Cooks today I got a couple of [indecipherable] when to open it. <strike>The Military authorities had been through everything &amp; of course had not repacked decently they no doubt expected to find BOMBS etc &amp; even shrapnel.</strike></p>
