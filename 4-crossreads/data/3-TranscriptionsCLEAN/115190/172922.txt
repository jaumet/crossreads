 Convalescence home until the Hospital ship arrives.  About 500 of us are here.  I may state that B & B has been the diet all through with an occasional bit of custard.  They have one cook here for 500 sick men so you can imagine the rest.  Remain here until the 9 th  Nov when we board the Red Cross Ship Dunluce Castle.  What a relief to sleep on a spring mattress & oh what joy to get some stew & bread & butter. 
 11 th  Nov.  I arrive at Alexandria & hear that the War is over.  We board the Hospital Train at 10 pm & arrive in Portsaid at 8 am 12 th  Nov  where  just when all the ships in the Harbour have let their whistles loose.
