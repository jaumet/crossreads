<p>May 1915<br/>Saturday 22<br/>Wet.   Trenches very muddy<br/>Enemy throwing large bombs but did no damage. Fairly quiet otherwise. The explosion from this bomb is something like that from our "Japanese Bomb".</p>
<p>Sunday 23<br/>Fine Beautiful peaceful day. Just an occasional crack from a sniper to break the silence. Officers from the enemy parleying for a truce to bury dead. In the afternoon the enemies guns got busy &amp; wounded three of our chaps. I went to hospital today feeling done up, been going for a month with nerves strung.</p>
