<p>4<br/>Wagga this time.  Do you remember Maj. Edwards being hopelessly out of direction when we were up there?  Did you see the butter-factory this time?  If I remember rightly it was a German who owned it.</p>
<p>I am going to France to-night with another draft, so will have to stop now.  This is only an excuse, because I have no news &amp; my pen is running out.</p>
<p>Please remember me to Mr. O'Reilly.</p>
<p>Your loving son<br/>Keith</p>
