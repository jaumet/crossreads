Darling Mither,
There's one thing I've forgotten to mention in my two last letters.  I was going to send you an Australia 5 note which I have gotten hold of. I have thought over it and think it is a bit of a risk sending such through the post.  But I want you to take 5 from my account for a Christmas Box, and I want you to write and tell me that you have done so.  Now, do this, Mither, otherwise I will be very annoyed. I still carry with me in my pocket-book the only wee note I've had from you so far, so treat yourself as you wish, and write and tell me you have done so, there's a Darling.
