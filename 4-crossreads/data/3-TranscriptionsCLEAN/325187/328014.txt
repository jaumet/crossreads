 Went to Donoughmore Church & saw grandfather's grave & on to Tullamurry quite a nice old place but only Farmers there now- Off to see Mr Ferrars Mother this afternoon.  The marshals got most of the old Grandfathers things I understand   And the bronze Sundial that was in the garden has gone & all the place is out of repair.  Aunt Anna has had the grave done up for herself she says dear old lady- I hope not for many years- she is wonderfully well at present
