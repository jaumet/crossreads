 When I opened my tin trunk this morning it was found that water had got amongst the books and papers and that many of them were wet.  A nuisance.

 Our clergyman is Colonel Ney [Nye], a  Bapt  Methodist from Victoria.  He told me that he is a Chaplain of the first class, & while holding no substantive rank is entitled to be saluted and addressed as Colonel.  He is of the "fancy" religions, according to the Sgt.
