Dear Mrs. Robertson
I have just got a letter from you written 22 April and was anxious about your having written from Omrah Hospital.

And thankyou for that woolly jacket you have sent me - its a pretty decent sort of affair and I may keep it for use after the war:  also the scarf.
The summer here is a rum sort of climate - some days really warm - most days chilly & all nights cold:  certainly
