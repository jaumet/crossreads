<p>Thursday, 14 January, 1915<br/>Every thing seems to point that we will move shortly our horses being fed six &amp; seven times daily, whilst our saddlery is being well rubbed &amp; cleaned.</p>
<p>Entries closed to night for our sports meeting to be held on Sat. week.  A fine programme has been arranged and I expect to run well in the V.C. race with Sammy and also in the relay race.  They are the only two I have entered for.  More stray mails received.</p>
<p>Friday, 15 January, 1915<br/>We have received a lot of gifts from kind donors such, as rice, tea, cocoa, chocolate, raisins etc. which are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>There is plenty of Aust. news circulated about the camp now, as we have rec. a lot of Aust papers it seems that they know as much about our movements in Aust as we do, and our letters are three weeks late with the news.</p>
<p>Issued with extra pair of blankets to-day, I now have 5 and an eiderdown.</p>
<p>Rec. a letter from E at last to-night dated 11/12/14.</p>
