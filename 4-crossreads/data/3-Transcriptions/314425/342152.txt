<p>We lost our Colonel. He was wounded &amp; when was being helped to a place of safety was killed by a shell. Two of our pack mules were killed but all the drivers escaped safely. Our casualties in men were heavy. All the Battalions suffered &amp; had to get help from the 11 Brigade. The 40. Batl. lost 8 pack mules &amp; the drivers all wounded.<br/>Last night the enemy planes bombed all around here &amp; many animals were killed. Our artillery team of 6 mules were killed a few chains from our camp &amp; 1 driver killed &amp; the others wounded. 3 other horses were killed along side of them and 7 drivers in all wounded. One bomb did all the damage. This morning I had a look at them &amp; saw the tail of the bomb. It had the broad arrow on it &amp; English markings. One of our planes flew over at the time &amp; it is possible they were all killed by our own bombs, through the observer making a mistake. In the adjoining wood several horses were killed &amp; men wounded by Tommy artillery a few days ago. There are a lot of mistakes made in this war. An artillery man secured the piece of bomb &amp; was to show it to his own officer with a view to having enquiries made</p>
