Preparing to move in a day or so. Not at all sorry for this billet has not been a very pleasant one. 31st Battalion raided enemy trenches successfully, but suffered casualties to the extent of 4 killed 22 wounded.

Off duty, walked around the outskirts of Armentieres. Have done a good deal of walking since our arrival in France. German prisoner (wounded) brought in here last night; a fine big fellow of a Bavarian Regiment who were opposed to our last night: Expect to move from here to-morrow.
