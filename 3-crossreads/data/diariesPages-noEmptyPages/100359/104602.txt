It brought back another such item to my mind but oh! what a difference.
 We arrived in the square just in time to see a big upstanding horse "knocked down" for 700 francs. It was quite amusing to hear the auctioneer yobbering away, about the horses, good points, in French. Another thing that rook the eye was about a score of fat little "porkers" asleep in a crate, lying on sweet, clean straw, they had been scrubbed with great care and looked much like a bunch of kiddies just washed to get ready for a school picnic. Stayed home at night and wrote to M.S.
Friday 8th
No bloomin? mail in yet "Frency" and "Jacko" got the pumps working today and several loads of clean clothes came in, so we had the pleasure of a hot bath and a change of clothes. Last night Aldiss met an old friend and got "foo the noo". On his way back to our billet after leaving the estaminet, he passed a post card shop and being in a humorous mood informed the young lady who kept it that it was time she closed and put out the lights, of course she was astounded, but mistaking "San" for a Policeman, she was about to close and wuld have done so, had not an Officer happened to be near by and explained things. Busy today whitewashing the new latrines that Dodson and Bill O?Sullivan have erected. Stan Wright is on the staff with me and we had quite a busy day.
Saturday 9th 
Baths opened for Business this morning. The first batch of rather ancient Ladies arrived on the scene just as we were getting up. There is a huge pile of dirty clothes to carry on with, so that will keep ?em out of mischief till the bathers arrive and change their clothes. Last night our chaps sent over goodness knows how many thousand tons of ironmongery to Fritz and sleep was quite out of the question.
