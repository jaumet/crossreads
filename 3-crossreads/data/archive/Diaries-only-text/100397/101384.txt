I found that the Quarter master had been round collecting blankets, all our blankets had to be handed in, and fresh ones sent aboard ship for us so we just spread our waterproof sheets out and slept in our overcoats, at 2 a.m. we were called out, and at 3 a.m. coffee and chops were brought down, then there was a scramble some had no mugs and some no plates, I had a plate but no mug so I secured a plateful of chops, then we presented Lieutenant Smith with a Toilet outfit amid a general uproar then fell in with our kits. we found that instead of only having one bag to carry to the Rly we had two our Kit bags were not sent to the boat at all, and we had to carry them. I dont think there is much news to give you so I will Ring off with Love to All heaps for yourself Bett ? from your Loving son Chas. G. Pryce
