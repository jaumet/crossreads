<p>My Dear Miss Lidgett</p>
<p>I received your kind parcel about a fortnight ago, and must apologise for not having written before. Things are moving here, in every sense of the word, and I have really not had the opportunity. The special socks are a success and not a bit rough on the feet. Today is a delightful day, a real spring day, but of course the trees are still bare, and it was only yesterday that we had a small fall of snow. We are now in a position in advance of the one we endured the winter on, and my word, the green fields make soldiering very different to that of a few weeks ago.</p>
