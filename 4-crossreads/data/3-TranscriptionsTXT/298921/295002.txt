January, 1915Friday 29The mornings at first like Riverina weather & here at Suez, not a ripple, about 20 large Steamers guarded by a Battleship & Destroyer, with one submarine are ready to go thro' the Canal -Great Oil Tanks line the bay, throwing their reflection on the water, with Date Palms in the background but no grass to be seen anywhere. Our Chief Mate who has spent his life in the Kanaka trade of the Islands has been making Dynamite Plugs as a farewell present to we officers to use among the Turks & Dervishes, he is a character; & thought this the best way to show his appreciation & as a farewell gift.
