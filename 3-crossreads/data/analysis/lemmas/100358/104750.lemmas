 We onli had a week of billet . On Sat 14th Jan . we march about 6 mile to a camp near Baizeaux villag . The camp was one of tent , and we felt it was an unfair thing to put us here after so short a stay amid the comfort of a villag , and so soon after our return from the line . The train began again , on the same line , and heartili sick we grew of it too . On the follow Tuesday snow fell , and a "freez " set in . Drill went on as usual . Everyth was white and glarey , and all waterhol daili show a thicker coat of ice . Then the weather settl to a normal temperatur , and winter was proper upon us . The snow had come to stay , and there was no water , all was ice . I discov that we were camp but a short distanc from the villag of Warloy , and made the opportun to visit it . In the larg adjunct to the civilian portion of the pretti villag cemeteri , I found dear old Alan 's grave . It is in a plot along with six other soldier who die on the same day , 14th August 1916 . It is mark by a simpl pioneer wooden cross , on to which are tack sever stamp tin label , bear name , rank , unit and date of death . But my thought will not bear write in this diari . This is not the place for such reflect , and so I will not dwell on them . The memori of my two visit to the spot so sacr to us all , is not one that cannot easili be conjur by anyon who has lost a veri dear friend , and who has stood , as I did , so near ? and yet so far , and ask as Mark Antoni did , a pardon of that bleed piec of earth . It was not long befor we were again talk of rumour concern anoth visit to the line . We hate the idea of move up amongst the too familiar scene of war-ravag countri ,
