<p>July<br/>Sunday 30th<br/>Church parade held with Bishop of Salisbury (?) in charge. I think it was the whole of 3rd Division in England which was present. There were about 6,000 troops and two generals. A service of this kind is not much of a <u>service</u> for the men who are not near the bishop etc.</p>
<p>After service we were off for the day and the afternoon was spent in writing up diary &amp; replying to letters which I received in the morning.</p>
<p>In the evening we paid another visit to Stonehenge and then packed our kit bags ready for an early move off in morning</p>
<p>Monday 31th<br/>Up at 5.30 am and after a scanty breakfast &amp; clearing up camp we moved off to Amesbury Stn. It was pretty hot but the walk is very nice We caught a train there &amp; changed at Porton and landed about 3.30 p.m. at Waterloo St in London. After a little wait on the platform we were marched to the free buffet and had lunch. We then caught a tube train changed at "Bank" and caught tube train to Kings Cross.</p>
<p>After catching the train there we arrived at Hitchin in 50 minutes About 15 mins. march brought us to the camp which is nicely placed amongst trees. We are housed 11 in a bell tent but this arrangement is only temporary. Except from the Lark Hill camp to Amesbury Stn &amp; from Hitchin Stn to camp we had to carry our kit bags when walking and so</p>
