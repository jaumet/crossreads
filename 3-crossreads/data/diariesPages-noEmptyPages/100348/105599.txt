On again today till we came to Bonneville. Halted here and I went and had a swim in a stream. The first good wash I have had for many moons. I feel much better now. This town is not much chop.
30/7/16.
Today we reached our destination a place called Pernois. I have a good billet so I won't mind staying here. The country is very pretty in this region; Picardy it is called I beleive. We had a church parade, it was more like a memorial service. We have lost many of our comrades, but they have died even as I would die. Our Colonel seemed very upset; he is a fine young fellow only 23 years old.
