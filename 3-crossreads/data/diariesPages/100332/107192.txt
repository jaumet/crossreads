number of girls are employed cleaning Engines various other duties about the yard also as Clerks in the Offices. They are totally different to our Australian cleaners, they are so smart quick in their work made a good impression. I soon made myself known to the Driver of my return Engine soon was quite at home. As my knowledge of the Westinghouse Air Brake is very little the Driver explained the various parts to me I was very much interested in the working of the Brake on the both journeys, we left Bethune on time which was 1.20 Pm after an interesting run we arrived in Hazebruick also on time. The country all along the line is looking very well as it was another glorius day, it was a treat to be out in the sunshine, it was a real spring day the French People all along were busy ploughing sowing the seed, there is very little land about which is not under cultivation of some sort. The French Peasants are a very industrious class of People have very little land lying idle. After leaving our train which continues on to Dunkirk we came back to Borre in good time signing off at 3.40 Pm, receiving instructions to go over the road to Bethune again tomorrow Thursday at the same time. After having an enjoyable tea I spent the evening in the Y.M.C.A. Hut at the rear of the Boys Huts, were a large number congregate for a game of Draughts etc.
