  
 France. 9th August 1916. 
 Dear Dad, 
 Think I must have missed a mail home last week, but have been going so brisk that haven't had a chance to write bar sending along three or four Field Service Cards to say I was still on top.  Can't of course, say what we have been doing, but if you have been reading the news around this date, you can get a fair idea.  We are now right back again for a short time after a very severe time in.  Harry and I are still on top, but pretty well knocked up, but with a day or two's rest will be O.K. again.  Charlie Witney is wounded, but as far as I can find out, not seriously.  The Colonel is still going strong.  Naturally, we are all feeling a little proud of ourselves for what we've done and are going back to repeat the dose when we've had a bit of a spell.  Could talk for a week on the events of the past fortnight, but they will have to hang over.  The Censorship is naturally stricter than ever just at present. 
 Thanks for fixing up things for me in case I get to England - (I am still dreaming of it).  I had a letter from Kreglinger & Fernan to say everything would be in order. 
 Also had a letter from Billy in England.  As far as I know he and Tom Croft are still there.  The other two must be mixed up in that affair on the Canal.  Hope the family luck still holds. 
 Have had a spell of real Summer weather here lately.  Did not think it could get as hot as this over here.  The Farmers are starting harvesting here now and causing great arguments amongst the so-called "Cockies" amongst us. 
 Hope you are now quite O.K. again.  Glad Ruby has gone away for a trip and hope it does her good. 
 Kindest regards to all in the Office, 
 Your affectionate Son, Roy.
