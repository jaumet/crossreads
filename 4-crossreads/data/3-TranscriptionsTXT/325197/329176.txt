 Wed 290th November. Spent the afternoon in London, but had to return to the Hospital on account of the fog. Got a lift from Ealing Broadway to Hospital in one of our motor ambulances. Would never have got home otherwise as all traffic was stopped. The fog was so thick that we could hardly see the gutter when looking out of the car and we had to go dead slow. 
 Thur 21. Nov. Discharged from the hospital this morning. In charge of two other boys. 
 When we got to Paddington Stn. London we decided to have another day in London, before going into camp. And we did have a good fly round 
 Fri 22nd Nov. Met the other boys at Paddington Station at 11-45am and left there by the 12-15 pm train, for Warminster where we arrived at 3pm. 
 Got a motor car to No 8 Camp No 1. Command depot Sutton Veny Wilts.
