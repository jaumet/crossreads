<p>December 4<br/>From 8th to 12th, the first of the new drafts away for England:  from 1st Div. men &ndash; up to June and past.  2nd draft rumoured for 18th-20th &ndash; if our leave is granted, back to time will bring England closely following.</p>
<p>Old Tom away on special English leave, takes to post old collection of maps and papers.</p>
<p>No mail.</p>
<p>22.<br/>Later.  Tonight, alone reading Thompson's "Poppy" and each following reading the lulling sweet musick has broken it.</p>
<p>But where I go your face goes too<br/>To watch lest I play false to you</p>
<p>and Bill's face has come to my mind, shall I know how well? &ndash; or shall I just have his friendly smile and acquaintance till H.Q.s are left for home?  He remains:  and a 1917 man he'll be a long while here &ndash; each day &ndash; how can he help it! &ndash; coming more and more under the horrible influence of Ken.  Then the laugh comes &ndash; twice we have known each other well &ndash; twice then we were half drunk &ndash; Christmas day and on N. Year's eve.</p>
<p>Tonight to sleep in the Lodge &ndash; under that damnable bell that rings early about 7, at 8 and 9!</p>
