who were listening were all thinking of our Dear ones at Home.Now that we are about to embark on our very dangerous voyage it makes one look at things in a sterner light.We all have to hand in our surplus blankets to-day, only retaining 1 per man.This is not inconvenient on this side, but I am afraid it will be a trifle breezy on the other.Today is the last day that letters will be accepted so I am afraid that all my good people will naturally become anxious, but it cannot be helped in the slightest.

All cameras had to be given in to-day many were the naughty words spoken by the owners, as they thought they would be allowed to retain them. Pamphlets are being issued relative to the use of Gas Helmets, also how to adjust them. This takes time to do quickly so we have all got to have so much drill every day after receiving them until properly efficient.We are not going to get any more pay for a long time, then I understand it will only be 1/- per day, so as the Aust's will not be flaunting money in the Tommies faces, as they did in Egypt.
