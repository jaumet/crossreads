 [Following paragraph is crossed out]  Letter from Mother &amp; Joe written on Xmas day so that is not bad   I should have called but guessed the Papers would let you know we had left ANZAC. We are expecting Gen Birdwood here this afternoon he is a popular Officer with the Australians &amp; N. Zealanders &amp; we all recognise he got us away from ANZAC very cleverly. Will post these notes with love to all it is great luck to think all my notes have reached you &amp; of late, your letters have also been delivered most regularly.
