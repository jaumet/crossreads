<p>are totally insufficient and unprovided for should at any time an epidemic break out here<br/>The Photo No/. 2 enclosed herein <u>shows </u> 3 &frac12; year 36 workers encaged in a small scanty barbwire exile in Torrens Island, S. A.  in there they had to  exist for 14 days some them ill and Hungary because they had to  subsist on Bread and water with exception of one cooked mean every third day - meaning rations of a criminal institution indeed worse.  These poor wretches had to live in that cage as you see it,  no shelter of any description being allowed only 3 blankets were given to each man.  Smoking was prohibited and one unfortunate youth named Fritz Mueller alias Tipp.  now here in camp was strapped to a tree with his hands above his head untill he fainted about 1 hour afterwards he was half naked and exposed to the bitter cold - this penalty was for breaking the order.  This is only one case out of thousands of illtreatments received at the hands of a capitalistic government.  All what happens in Torrens Island Langwarren Holdsworthy ect.  also the conditions on the transport of internees  from Western Australia to barely 2 years ago is too much to be enumerated.  Just a few cases</p>
