 1917 3rd June. Yesterday's events seemed unreal &ndash; dreams &ndash; on awakening this morning.  But the brown hammocks swinging in rows quite brought back the reality of things. 
 "Breakfast" was at 8. 
 On the tables (bare, of course) were a couple of dishes of bread &ndash; vile-smelling blackish dough which resembled nothing so much as well-chewed "Spearmint."   Black, sugarless coffee came along also &ndash; was very good. 
 We mess in the partitioned off "Officers Quarters".  Dinner (at 11.30 am) was considered "special", being Sunday.  Consisted of soup, a small piece of Hamburger steak &amp; large quantities of dried potatoes. 
 The method of serving is rather funny.  A steward carries along a couple of tins to the galley for each table; he returns the tins to the head of each table and serves out the contents to the expectant "diners".
