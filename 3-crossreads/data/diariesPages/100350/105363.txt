(18) Violent storm passed over this afternoon. Things were real merry for a time, several large beach trees were blown down, one of our observation balloon,s broke away from its moorings and soon was out of sight among the black clouds, both the observers came down in Parachutes, after being tossed about like feathers.
(19) On the move again. 45th left "Renescure" in motor lorries at 10 this morning and reached our destination near "Neuf-Berquin" at midday, and were billeted in the usual way.
(22) One of the enemy,s Aeroplanes had a day out to day, he came over and shot down no less than 5 of our observation balloons which all came to earth in flames. The observers lost no time in hopping out of their cages, of course each man is equipped with a Parachute as a life saver.
