After having a spell we set out on the marched reached the town of St Ouens in the afternoon it is a big town had a good time there that night the people in the town were very good to us for we were about the first Australian troops they had seen. After staying over night we moved off next morning marched to Vignacourt a distance of about four miles. At the place all the houses barnes are fitted out with electricity but the town is partly deserted for very few people live there. We only stayed there one day next morning moved to Allonville where we were put in tents in the grounds belonging to Hennissy the brandy distillers. We stayed there about three days went through training in wood fighting during one skirmish passed through an aerodrome some planes ascending descending.
