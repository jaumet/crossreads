How these poor devils of infantry men stand the strain is beyond me. We arrived at the A.D.S. about 4.30 and very soon got outside some Bully Beef and Bread as we had not had anything to eat since about 7 a.m. just to our left is High Wood and to our right Belville Wood. Both the scenes of fierce fighting. There are thousands of graves about, with crosses made out of amm. Cases and any old timber available and most of them have hats or caps hung up also. The ground is shewed with shells, (both Germans and our own) rifles, coats, bayonets, overturned guns and last but not least we saw a tank. It was partly buried in self mud, and was an object of much interest to us. It is certainly beyond me to describe it, but is a very weird looking object and no wonder the Huns couldn't make it out. It is driven by motor engines and instead of wheels, it has big caterpillars with which it clambers over trenches or any other old thing that comes in its way. The trees in the wood are without leaves or branches, and look just like so many old posts standing out of the ground. The 98th F.Amb. is carrying on the A.D.S. which we are to take over tomorrow. There are hundreds of aeroplanes about and they hover over Fritz's lines as cheeky as sparrows. We are all camped in a big tent. The mud is ankle deep inside it, so we went over to the Amm. Dump and got a pile of empty cases to put on the ground. It made a hard bed but it was better than sleeping in the mud. The Corp. Cook of the 98th made us some cocoa for tea which was a great treat. We sat round his fire and had a good warm till he sent us off, then we went to Bed, Four of us slept as close as possible. First came Mac, then Myself, then Billsy May and lastly Roy Knowles. "Billsy" is nice and fat and kept us all warm. We didn't get much sleep as the guns made such a terrific din, and at times fairly shook the ground. A few shells lobbed very close but nobody was hit.
