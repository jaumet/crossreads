<p>11.11.15<br/>Thurs 11th<br/>We had a rather busy time of it this morning running messages I had a trip to Divisional HQ &amp; found a shell had landed just before me killing 3 men &amp; wounding 4 others Tomlinson who was on with me had a much longer trip to the 1st Inf. Bde which is on the extreme right at Gaba Tepe; I had another trip to Bde HQ tonight with the daily state as Les was feeling a bit off color, apparently apple tarts &amp; jellies are a trifle too rich for him; I came on duty from 9 till 2, &amp; our switch board is not working too well. Nelson was on the phone &amp; there was a row with Bde as they could not get us, it is rather a  complicated matter &amp; we can see no reason why the plug will not work in the centre hole, I believe there is to be an enquiry tomorrow</p>
