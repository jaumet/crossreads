<p>To Resume the Diary I may say that the night on deck was a complete failure.  High wind, sleet &amp; rain and I got little sleep and much chill.</p>
<p>We arrived in Constant. under the very worst auspices and a weary waiting on the wharf for transport of our luggage did not improve matters.  The nice General (one) Croker who had been kind to us at Chanak passed by and recognising the outfit followed Bean &amp; self into ordnance where we were trying to buy necessary details of equipment for Palestine and passed us the time of day &amp; gave us good wishes.  (A very nice General too.)  We got somebody to take notice of us finally and got a good possy in the Offices Rest House where they do us better in regard to grub and do us less as regards charges than would a local hotel.</p>
<p>Constantinople from the picturesque point of view consists of the picture so</p>
