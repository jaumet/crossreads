There is Pinto the cabin boy to do anything you want &amp; anything I can do for you at any time I will do it.

He then talked about his life on board &amp; I thought what a cosy little cabin it would be. On the bulkhead &amp; on the table were the instruments of two wireless stations &amp; never being familiar with a complete commercial station I was very eager to take a watch at the instruments, but Mr Sharples (henceforth Teddy) assured me not to be over anxious, as I would get all I wanted later on. Teddy was an Englishman, with always a faint smile on his face. He came from Wigan in Lancashire.</p>
