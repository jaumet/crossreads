Hospital bombarded again. Got our patients into the saps and dug-outs for safety. Met M. who left us when we were at No 2 A.G.H. and who had gone to England. He stayed with us in our dug-out as No 2 Station of which he is now a member are only getting this Hospital ready. Spent a very pleasant time with him giving our past experiences since we parted in Egypt.
Dec 8th Wed.We evacuated our patients during the night. This is a pretty difficult job as there is no lights bar one right on the point of the pier. However we have carried stretchers this few hundred yards so often that we seemed to know every step of the way, even in the pitch darkness.
Dec 8th Wed.Hospital again bombarded with howitzers. One of the shells went right through our operating tent  but did not explode. They would not have been left to tell the tale. It is marvellous that only one person has been wounded in these now frequent bombardments of the C.C.S. L.R. and G.P. dug the unexploded shell out of the earth in doing so they had to dig about four feet down for it.
