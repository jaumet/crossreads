 Very early this morning a large batch of men were sent away from this camp to go on board the Czar for Australia, another batch will be going on the Port Denison. Tonight I was at church at Chickerel. There was only a local preacher &ndash; congregational. After the service the choir came to the Y.M.C.A. and sang a number of hymns, &amp; an official of the Y.M.C.A. gave a short address on love being the greatest power in the world. 
 Monday March 24. 1919.   134 A fine morning. I was up early this morning and had a hot bath. The education officer Mr. A.Wollard is leaving Monte Video to morrow to act in a similar capacity on board a troop ship. I was detailed for guard this morning. 
 I have finished reading an "Introductory Atlas of International Relations" by Henry Clay &amp; Arthur Greenwood which I had on loan from the A.I.F. Education Department. I was at a concert tonight in the Y.M.C.A. Hut , given by the Bournmouth Concert Party. It was a very good entertainment. 
 Tuesday March 25. 1919.   135 Fine but windy.
