  
 Mch 21 it; a glorious spring night & we of the are bivouacked on the bank of the Suez Canal. Merrily blaze the camp fires against a background of pines & River oaks. Immediately behind is the railway with its siding & splendid lights. Men - hundreds of them pass in & out of the trees & everywhere there is life & movement. To top everything the 3 Batt Band is playing like one thing - and - we had a jolly good tea  And this, perhaps will be our last night in the 'Land of the Pharaohs" How many of us will ever pass again through the Suez - I wonder? 
 22 Cold as blazes last night. Left for Alexandria at 1.45 am & did a freeze until about 9 this morning. Travelled on top of baggage in an open truck & minus an overcoat or blankets Bought fresh cooked eggs & bread for breakfast.
