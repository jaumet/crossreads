 lately. No sooner had he finished zonking than he sent over a large number of high velocity shells  on the  round the wood below us (evidently aimed at the railway), shelled the main road (apparently), &amp; put over high bursting shrapnel  over  on our ridge. As I learned this morning he put pellets through the Q.M. tent &amp; an Operation Tent. 
 The next excitement was a very fierce storm, which was a natural result of the oppressive evening. Thunder claps created far more noise than the crashes of near bursting shells, &amp; the wind &amp; the rain tore at everything with terrible fury. Tents collapsed or had to be held up in one camp, &amp; a wall (ruined) collapsed on the Sergeant's cook house, I was immune from discomfort in the cellar, but the noise prevented any sleep. 
 A Section has just had orders to move up so I am left alone in the cellar.
