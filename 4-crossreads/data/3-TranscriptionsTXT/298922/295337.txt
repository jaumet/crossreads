 El Risa 
 "Pow Wow" at B.H.Q. re our action &ndash; General  Chauvel  rode alongside coming home &amp; said "The boys did well" a little courteousness &amp; thanks go a long way when all a mans nerves are on edge &amp; he's dog-tired. 
 We brought in a number of Bedouin &amp; their Camels along with Turkish prisoners. Prisoners were fat &amp; fit. What I have told you is only a part of proceedings. The 1, 2, 3 Regts. &amp; N.Z.M.R. were all in it with Tommy Batteries of 8 guns. Will give you more particulars later, busy reorganising. 5th Mtd. Brigade of Yeomanry were on one flank &amp; got badly cut up. Gloucesters Warwicks &amp; Worcestershire brids. did well &amp; many died gallantly.
