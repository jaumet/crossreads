  
 24.6.15 Thurs. 24th.  About dark last night the Turks opened fire with high explosive shrapnel shells, & there was no fault with the range, they fired quite a number of shells & wounded 16 New Zealanders between here & the Supply Depot.  The Turks opposite us have been busy the last night or two reconstructing their trenches & the bomb thrower here has been firing bombs at them on & off all night.  A Sqd. Signallers relieved us at dinner time to-day & Les, Stan & I went for a swim this afternoon & it was lovely.  The Turks succeeded in shelling & sinking 3 of our water barges yesterday & Tuesday & have been short of water in consequence & had to go about two miles towards the beach to get any to-day (to the wells), a battery of 5 inch Howitzers were landed on the beach this afternoon.
