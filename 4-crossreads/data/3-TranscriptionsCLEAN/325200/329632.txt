wick well basted in hot grease .... I think I shall take it as an omen.I don't think I am very popular in the tent just now; four blanket wrapped forms looking more like contorted corpsed than men are lying down preparatory for sleep, and from the exaggerated sighs  &  polite requests to shade that - candle I gather that they are wooing Sweet Lethe in vain.But then, the time honoured maxim in the army seems for the most part to be "Blast you Bill I'm all right".
