<p>1st. October. The weather is inclement and miserable, inspite of this, I spent several hours in the garden, talking with the officers. There are seven British officers imprisoned here to receive Surgical attention. Their mode of living is similar to ours, but they are allowed a small amount of money weekly. From this meagre pittance the Huns deduct the cost of their rations. They are unable to procure anything in addition to the Hun food. Capt.

Most of us display the contents of parcels in a conspicuous place, merely to tantalize the Huns; this is our only means of revenge. Huns are persistently worrying us to sell them food which is unprocurable in Stettin. The few household articles obtainable are abnormally expensive.
