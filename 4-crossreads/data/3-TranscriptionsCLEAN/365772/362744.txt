  
 You will think I am going a bit strong dear I know but the uncertainty of life here makes one live for today only & let tomorrow look after itself. I am getting on O.K. in the regiment, have a good name with the heads & being an old hand "one of the few left" I have a good time, my second star will be out shortly & if I live through the next scrap will have hopes of a captaincy & then I will be contented. Well my dear I will close now. Wishing you, R & B the best of health & fondest love, from your loving brother Ken.
