Reveille as usual
Had an exceptionally heavy night last night only had one operator to get over the work we handled over 300 mss in the first 12 hours.
A detachment of the Squadron came in during the afternoon including all the outcasts of the troop they are here for the stunt that is coming off tomorrow night at the same time are installing a Divn Signal Office so will relieve us of a lot of traffic.
Out of touch with the outposts at 1700 was out till after 10 climbing round hills gullys cliffs etc at times out in front of the cossac posts. DRs doing trips up to 7 miles taking 5 hours to do it in heavy sand, the New Zealanders are doing it day about with us.
Bed midnight.

Reveille at 5
Heaps of work today in preparation for tomorrow when great things are expected, we got all equipment together in good order. The aeroplanes reports were favorable for no activity of unusual occurrence was noticed amongst his troops.
Mail is expected although I don't suppose anything will come to light for me.
Downing is treating me like a trump, he has given me an officers saddle (having no further use for it) in many other ways he is extending the glad hand. Hal his section have got the Sig office fixed up now our traffic should be much lighter, we did 323 today which is a record for any Signal Troop compliments are flying galore.
