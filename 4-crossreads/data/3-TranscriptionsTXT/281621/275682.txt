 Tuesday 23 The weather is still bitterly cold and today we moved to Albert where we were billeted in the old girls school. We are going into the line near Martinfuchs and forming an H.D.S. at Bazentin le Petit. 
 Wednesday 24 At Albert still but weather still freezing. Fritz has shelled the town today but I have heard of no casualties. I go on leave on 29th so cant see much use in going up to the line. 
 Thursday 25 March from Albert to Bazentin ADS &amp; from there up to the line on the left of Flers &amp; in front of High Wood. We came up through Contalmaison &amp; past Casualty Corner but law &amp; order prevail there now so the place cannot be recognised. Things are quiet here but the division's not in yet but comes in tomorrow. The snow is still on the ground which is frozen hard. 
 Friday 26 Ground is still snow covered and frozen hard which makes almost all shells burst. I move back to Edwards post this afternoon in anticipation of going on leave. 
 Saturday 27 On ration fatigue to Bazentin A.D.S. It is rumoured that leave has been suspended on account of traffic congestion.
