Monday 14 JanuaryLast night was very cold & freezing but early this morning was quite warm and the ground was snow covered to a depth of six inches. Not a breath of wind and the result is the snow is heavy on the trees & the landscape presents the same faireyland appearance as it did about three weeks ago.  Snowballing in force. A walk, very slippery, to Ballieul again. News that "Lea Brook" has been sold.
Tuesday 15 JanuaryA true winters day.A heavy westerly wind blowing up gusts of heavy rain in intervals, raining all day.  Not cold but the prospects are of more rain.
