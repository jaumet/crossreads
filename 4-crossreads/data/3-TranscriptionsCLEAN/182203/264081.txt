My dearest Moth. & Sisters, To-day is Sunday and the anniversary of our dear Father's death, what a blessing he did not live to see his own loved country in such sorrow. It is really very sad to see this wonderful country shaded in gloom. The climate is the opposite to the Egyptian & has rained nearly every day since we arrived, although we have managed to get out every day. Am not settled in a position yet, it is rumoured that the remainder of us (ten) are going to France. I should much prefer to stay here but must do as I'm told. I'm really feeling very miserable to-day at not hearing from my beloved. Have only heard that he had "Malaria" & in Hosp. in Ypres on July 12th , cannot find out anything else. Poor old chap.
