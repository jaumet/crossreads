  
 In the afternoon there was no parade.  I went on main guard at night. 
 Saturday 17th [Apr] Was let off main guard as there were too many warned.  There was a general clean up of the lines in the morning.  In the afternoon there was a buckjump riding exhibition but nobody managed to ride the horses.  A Squadron played C Squadron cricket resulting in a win for C on the first innings. 
 Sunday 18th Did nothing all day except stables.  It is pretty slow in camp.  It is impossible to sleep or rest as the flies are so troublesome.  Was warned for picket tonight.  B Squadron played C Squadron cricket, C Squadron winning. 
 Monday 19th Got ready for town police patrol.  About 68 men of the 6th are to put in a week at [indecipherable] Barracks.
