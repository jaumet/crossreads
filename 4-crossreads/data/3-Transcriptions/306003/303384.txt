<p>7-6-16<br/>Wed 7th<br/>Last night I was kept busy till 10 oclock as the post (No 1) had been shifted out &frac12; a mile.  I connected onto a line running within a couple of hundred yards of the post &amp; found it was a dead line, so had to go back to another &amp; after connecting up found the line was broken somewhere &amp; had some difficulty finding the break;</p>
<p>This morning at 8 oclock Les, Reid &amp; I went to Bde. H.Q. for telephone instruction, but learnt nothing I did not know before, but heard the naval battle had turned out very well on the English side &amp; that the Australians had very heavy casualties at Verdun;<br/>The Taube came as far as Oghratina this morning &amp; it is rumored Samson is coming here with a big war-plane; Samson is rather a dare-devil &amp; was idolised on the Peninsular</p>
