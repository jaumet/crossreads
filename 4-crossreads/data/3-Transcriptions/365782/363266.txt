<p>Summer Song<br/>Down by the river,<br/>Ere morning had grown into noon,<br/>A thrush with his singing began,<br/>And as sudden was silent.  Again<br/>His note came trilling, and soon<br/>With a song that rippled and ran<br/>To a constant happy refrain<br/>The trees were aquiver.<br/>While the dew-light around us still glistened<br/>A thrush with his singing began.<br/>And we stood, and listened and listened.<br/>For hearing this joyous new-comer,<br/>We knew you were too, O Summer,<br/>Down by the river.</p>
<p>O, our hearts rang for you,<br/>All through the morning of haze,<br/>The tremulous song of the thrush,<br/>Till you rose in a glory of light.<br/>Then, season of radiant days,<br/>There came a wonder and hush<br/>That spread over hollow and height.<br/>And no song rang for you.<br/>Ah, though our lips may not follow<br/>The tremulous song of the thrush,<br/>Yet, when over the hillside and hollow<br/>You break through the morning of haze,<br/>That parts from your splendor asunder,<br/>We too, may be mute in our wonder,<br/>With him that sang for you.<br/>Harley Matthews<br/>Fairfield<br/>N.S.W.</p>
