<p>24th January 1917 (Con) stack this afternoon. Good job none of us were on  top. Most of our staff out today had narrow squeaks from shrapnel &amp; 5.9s lobbing near them. The Germans seem to have very crook ammunition &amp; a good many of their shells strike without bursting. I hope 'his' stock is all like the present ones. Did not do much after coming off at 10.</p>
<p>25th January 1917. Day opened very fine but cold. Went on duty at 6 oclock till 830. Fritz's artillery active today Some of his big shells were bursting over our position. Big pieces of shell came flying into our garden. I walked down "Cherry House"  way &amp; did not venture too far that way for artillery fire. Walked to the town &amp; bought a few things. Went on duty again at 12.30 &amp; came off at 5. Didn't go out but went to bed to rest till 12 when I do the next shift of 2 hours.</p>
<p>26th January 1917. Got up at 7.30 &amp; had breakfast. Walked down toward Cherry House looking for more loot for our dugout. Came back with crockery etc and intending to get a stove tonight . After dinner went on duty at CH one of our Ops and afterwards went to "L" another OP. Both chimney stacks by the way. Spent a cold afternoon there at the phone. Came back at 5 &amp; had tea. After tea went down for the stove &amp; had a rough time bringing it along. Fixed it up &amp; went to bed tired.</p>
