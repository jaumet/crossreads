<p>some putty stuff, and almost breaking my jaw with a horse-shoe arrangement, told me to call the following Sunday to &quot;try on&quot; or &quot;fit in&quot; or something of that sort.&nbsp; I duly called and after sitting in his chair and having my mouth mauled about a good deal, explained my visit.&nbsp; He at once took a &quot;set&quot; from a basin and started to try and make them fit me.&nbsp; After pushing down one side and then the other and the opposite side rising up each time, he seemed to think something must be wrong.&nbsp; He &quot;stood off&quot; and looked at me for some time, making me feel quite nervous.&nbsp; At last when I had been able to get my mouth back to something like it&#39;s normal shape, I managed to tell him that the &quot;plate&quot; he had been trying to make fit my mouth had front teeth, whereas I already had some of my own.&nbsp; He then asked my name and found that he had been trying to fix another chap&#39;s teeth in my mouth.&nbsp; However later he told me that my &quot;plate&quot; had been broken while being made.&nbsp; I did not worry him any further, but carried on with what remained of those which nature had provided.</p>
