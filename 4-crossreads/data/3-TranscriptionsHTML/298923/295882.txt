<p>4 August 1918 Sunday<br/>Went Church in YMCA very close &amp; stuffy-<br/>Many rumours on this front that Germans are leaving the Turks, &amp; that an Armistice may come out of it, this is to be seen ere you get this.  Also hear Soissons retaken by us &amp; many prisoners-  Just learnt that the facetious telegram from Cairo was a pukkha one &amp; a little daughter was born last Thursday Aug 1st so of course I am off tonight to the little wife poor KIDDY all by herself I think she deserves the DSO</p>
