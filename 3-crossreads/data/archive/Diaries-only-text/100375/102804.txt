most inconsiderate surgeon I have ever come across, and that is saying a great deal.
The night of the 28th. and 29th. a terrific bombardment took place but seemed to be some distance away. Between the thumping of my finger, the thumping of my head, and the thump, thump, thump, thump of the guns, I was almost driven crazy. The wounded who have been dealt with here are all French troops They had been rushed up from the south into Kemmel Sector and not having hospital accomodation of their own up north here, we had to open up and take them in
Trying to get the conditions of labour altered in the O.T. If we do not get things altered soon I am afraid the strain is becoming to much for us. I am determined to get out of it by hook or by crook.
April 30th.Had to get Gas and Oxygen in order to get my finger opened up
Feel very much better, now that, I have got it opened up. Have been put into hospital
Had a letter from John, in which he stated that his batt has been twice mentioned in Dispatches within the last three weeks
Very light cases are being received into the hospital now.
