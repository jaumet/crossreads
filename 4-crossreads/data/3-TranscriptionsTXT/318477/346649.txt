I've been lately thinking over Bil the KaiserThe man that wants to rule the Land & seaNow when I think of Balmy bil the KaiserI wonder does he think the same of me.in fighting he is very fond of fireling [firing?]John Bull will find his points without a doubt.Now here's a man with fame as bad as Nero'sWhat do you think of him I like to know.
Now all you have to do is to boo boo boysWhen I ask you what you think of Kaiser Bil.In fact well you can call him what you like BoysAnd when your's on your own I know you will,Your often heard him speak in praise of heroes,in chorusus you will let your voices rise,Before he has a chance to throw towel inCount up to nine & put the blighter out.
