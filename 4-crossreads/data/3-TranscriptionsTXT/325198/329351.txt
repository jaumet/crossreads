25 Aug, 1916Our Brigadier is full of cheerHe shouted out "Hooray""Youre making history" he said,And then he rode away.
And in this tale if you read on,You'll find out how its done,Of how old Abdul came to fight,And how a victorys won.
When Abdul left DamascusWith an Army Corp or so,He never even asked usPermission for to go.
He came along the sea-coastAnd swanked  at Ber el AbdAnd uttered there a big boastOf the land that he had grabbed.
He marched to OgrabinaAnd stayed there for a weekAs much to say "We've seen yerSo don't give us any cheek"
And then he came to QuatiaAnd camped around the wellAs much to say "We'll face yerAnd give yer ---- hell"
