<p>with people in the train about customs etc. tea drinking &amp; so on, they being astounded at the amount of tea we drink in Australia. We caught the Metro tube at the Gare du Nord to Opera station &amp; after enquiring the way a couple of times found our Hotel Montana in Rue l'Echelles, the streets very misty &amp; dark. Engaged a room with two beds with bathroom attached 18f per day for two. The night porter spoke English so had no trouble. Lovely beds &amp; a wash before turning in, the luxury of it all after our late home being taken quite naturally. At the station we were met by a representative of the Soldiers home who tried to persuade us to stay there but we were only in Paris for 4 days so did not mind the expense of a decent hotel. The work these people are doing is of great value and makes it possible to men with little money to see the city without being robbed or getting into trouble.</p>
