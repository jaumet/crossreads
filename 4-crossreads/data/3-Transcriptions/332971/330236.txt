<p>Yesterday 4 of us obtained 4 hrs leave to go for a drive &amp; though we can scarcely keep our eyes open 'we are so Sleepy' we enjoy seeing these spots.  The alleged spot where Moses was in the bulrushes &ndash; The oldest Coptic Church in Egypt.  The ancient City of Babylon.  The old Slave Markt &amp; the present cemetery, where our soldiers are buried.  Of these again the camera will tell the tale.</p>
<p>This little tit-bit I meant to have mentioned before &ndash; that the Arrogan is stranded on its own bottles in Mudros Harbour &ndash; <u>glass</u> not <u>brass</u>.  Serve them right.</p>
<p>13th  The Hospital seems to be emptying fast.  Yesterday morning crowds went away by the Runic &amp; more today by the Karoola.</p>
<p>I'm feeling helplessly flat again, for on reading the orders for the day I see we must be inoculated for Cholera.  When we come back we'll be walking bacteriologists for germs, but what will it feel like to have a few will again?</p>
