<p>I had leave for two week-ends after that. Then King George 1V held a review at Bulford and granted us all another four days leave &amp; off to London I went again. It was not long after this that we completed five months solid training &amp; on the 21st November we left for France.  On arriving at Le Havre we got off the boat &amp; did what I reckon was the hardest march we ever did from the wharf to the rest Camp with full packs, 2 blankets, 2 P.H. gas Helmets, 250 rnds ammunition &amp; reserve ration.  We were a bit puzzled at first with the French money but we very soon got the hang</p>
