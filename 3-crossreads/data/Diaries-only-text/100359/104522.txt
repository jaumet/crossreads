We returned to Cairo and had some light refreshment then we took a Gharry and drove to Mouskey St. where the Bazaars are. This is a very interesting part of the city and one could spend hours there. Here we saw the silk weavers, metal works in brass, silver, copper etc. grinding spices, making jewellery and amber adornments. There were beautiful things for sale and made one wish ones banking account was a large one. We wandered around these narrow streets for about 2 hours, then we returned to the vicinity of Shepheards?, had tea (not at Shepheards?) and by this time it was near 7 o'clock, so we got aboard the train and arrived back at Tel.el-Kebir about 9.30 p.m. after a most eventful and enjoyable day.

Wednesday 8th
Field day, Nursing Section cooks and transport all out, together for the first time. We were just settled down nicely to our work when Serg. Marshall arrived to inform Major Williams that Capts. North and Donald had received orders to join the 2nd Division at once, so he and Capt. Wooster returned to camp to say Goodbye to them, and our gallant B. Section was left in charge of Serg. "Cut it out" the result being ? a days loafing. We got back to camp about 3.30 and I printed a few pictures.
