  
 June 19 buttercups & daisies sway gently to & fro in the breeze. From the oaks & beeches which border the Road come the horse cries of the rooks; & thrushes, blackbirds & robins fill the air with song. Many thoughts flash through my mind as I lie full length on the yielding grass beneath the overspreading branches of a mighty  oak . Gnarled & weather beaten he is, like some old veteran, & yet firm as a rock. But now the sun lies hidden behind the cloud veil & something of a quiet seems to creep in almost unawares; the wind grows colder & not a few of my feathered friends cease their carolling - and here in this quiet spot I say farewell to England - the dear Homeland, but still my thoughts stray ever to "Gods Demesne" Australia! & the loved ones waiting there, and let us breathe a prayer for our gallant boys in the trenches - aye - for those who die suffering silently in the Hospitals.
