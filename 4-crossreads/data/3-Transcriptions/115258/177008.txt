<p>As we got near Mafrah we could see signs again of our aeroplane&#39;s work on the retreating turks: A column of transport had evidently been caught going along the road here, and although many of them had got into railway cuttings and under bridges; it had not saved them from the MG&#39;s of our airmen. Then we got into Mafrah. Our planes had caught a long train standing in the station there; and I wont try and describe to you what I saw. The accounts <s>of</s> you read in the paper of the condition in which sheep are in after a long delayed stock train arrives at its destination would give you some idea of what we saw - only not in sheep, and on top of all this the whole place as well was a wreck.</p>
