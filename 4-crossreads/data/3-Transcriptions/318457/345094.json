<p>The flagship came into the bay early this morning, also the "Encounter" which did scouting work down the Channel. She took possession of a merchant vessel  Zambezi which was brought along with us when we sailed. It was known from wireless signals that the German chiefs, one at least was only a few miles away. They were asking about us. However they did not appear. About midday the "Encounter" signalled "German cruiser 10 miles away" &ndash; Everyone was alert &ndash; stations occupied and preparations made but it was a mistake. The smoke seen proved to be the merchant ship abovementioned.</p>
<p>Rabaul is in a pretty situation. On the right her impressive conical peaks of volcanic origin and about 1000 ft high stand up boldly, and on the shores of the bay in which is the harbour are hundreds of acres of cocoanut palms and residences around them. Splendid deep water is found everywhere right up to the shore. There are white sandy beaches for some miles along the bay but generally speaking the foreshores are rocky and bald.</p>
<p>We sailed about 4.30pm for Rossel Id where the "Melbourne" was guarding a collier which she is supposed to have captured. We are all in need of coal, so this is very fortunate.</p>
