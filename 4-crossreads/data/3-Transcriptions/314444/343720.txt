<p>Rollestone,<br/>23/1/17</p>
<p>Dearest Mother &amp; Father,<br/>Recieved your very welcome letter written on the 6 December. I am doing well &amp; as you see still in England. It is very cold here. and always raining.<br/>I was up to London from Friday last until yesterday. I had a very enjoyable time. Miss Astin &amp; I went to the Theatre on Saturday night. Mark Hamburg was one of the performers. He plays lovely. I had just got off the train at Waterloo when the big explosion took place. It made some noise I can tell you. The chaps about surprised me they were rushing everywhere, saying the Zepps were here. It took me &frac34; of an hr before I could get a taxi to venture out to take me to the Grafton Hotel. The theatres &amp; restaurants are always packed in London. They all seem to have plenty of money.<br/>News is scarce but I am feeling well &amp; hope you are all the same. Good luck<br/>Best wishes &amp; love<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom</p>
