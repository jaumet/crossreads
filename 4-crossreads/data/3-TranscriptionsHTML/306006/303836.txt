<p>20-4-17<br/>Regt came East of the Wadi &amp; put out outposts for the night,<br/>Heard today that the Tommies took Gaza yesterday with the aid of gas &amp; tanks but the Turks counter attacked &amp; retook them &amp; the position today is very unsatisfactory. Our horses had no water from 2PM on the 18th till 2 oclock this morning as we are afraid of the wells being poisoned.</p>
