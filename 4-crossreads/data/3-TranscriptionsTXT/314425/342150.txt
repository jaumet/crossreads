I earned 5 francs this evening by taking another man's horses to water. He is very windy. Our brigade goes over the top tonight and 6 pack mules &amp; drivers carrying each 2 boxes of ammunition goes with them. We are to remain here tonight although we expected to move with the Battalion. The Battalion will proceed up accompanied by a barrage on each side of them and it is not expected that they will meet with any opposition. Tanks have been over the country &amp; reported it clear of the enemy. This is the first time that pack animals have accompanied the Battalion into action. 
 Sunday Aug. 11. 1918. 1468. The weather continues fine. Today is hot &amp; sultry foggy in the morning. The stunt last night was a failure. Every battalion in the Brigade was severely handled by the enemy.
