<p>20th March 1919</p>
<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>With reference to the report of the regrettable loss of your husband, the late No. 3770, Private T. Bell, 20th Battalion, I am now in receipt of advice which shows that on 8th April 1918, a shell hit the dugout in which he was sleeping killing him immediately. He was buried &frac12; mile North of Hangard and 5 miles South of Corbie, a cross being erected over his grave.</p>
<p>The utmost care and attention is being devoted where possible to the graves of our soldiers. It is understood that photographs are being taken as soon as it is possible and these will be transmitted to next-of-kin when available.</p>
<p>These additional details are furnished by direction, it being the policy of the Department to forward all information received in connection with death of members of the Australian Imperial Force.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>J M Lean<br/>Officer i/c Base Records</p>
<p>Mrs. B. Bell<br/>15 Edwards Street,<br/>Merewether,<br/>Glebe,<br/>Newcastle,<br/>New South Wales</p>
