I issued just over 650 all told &amp; at last when I knocked off I had some supper &amp; was glad enough to crawl into bed without a murmer.<br/>On Friday morning- Good Friday-  things were much quieter &amp; I went back to the Medical Room  When I woke that morning, Nature had draped the earth with her mantle of purest white &amp; up till 11 a.m. the snow was still falling fairly thickly  At 12.30 the sun was shining from a beautiful blue sky &amp; I have never, in all my life, seen a prettier picture <strike>that</strike> than Nature on Good Friday Afternoon in London here- overhead a blue sky with a few fleecy clouds about, below, a pure white covering where it had remained undisturbed.</p>
