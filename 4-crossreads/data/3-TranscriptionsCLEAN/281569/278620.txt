 Revielle as per usual 
 The CO never put in an appearance last night they got to Waddy Natrune OK at 3.15 then set out for El Bookir then later Bir Victoria the three got there alright & as juice was running low they sent Charlie on to Kattaba to see if he could pick up some more he wired back to the effect that none was available, he thereon set out for home where he arrived at 7.30. Mel & the boss had in the meantime met a car coming in from the Waddy & they got each a bottleful of juice & the Boss thought they had enough to bring them home, they then set out at 5.15 for here everything went OK for a couple of miles then the Boss did his nut & shot out of the desert, by this time it was pitch dark & none of the lamps burning. Mel kept straight
