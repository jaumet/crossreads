 JULY &nbsp; SUNDAY 23 &nbsp; 1916 
 A nice warm day. Had a church parade in morning &amp; fell out with the Presberterian &amp; other Prodestant denominations &amp; went to the YMCA hut. It was very like a salvation army meeting outside a pub. A couple of fellows from Mooki came up in afternoon &amp; had a yarn. Polishing up to go to London tomorrow.
