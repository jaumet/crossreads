 14 To my darling Esme and Stella and little Beatrice I must write Also to Mother 
 By this mail I send heaps of postcards I have addressed them to everyone but you can all arrange what you like about them 
 My reason for sending them is that they give a good idea of some of the places and are almost as good as letters in that way 
 Thank the dear old children for their fine letters to me for this time I fear there is no time to write to everyone. 
 I thank my good old friend Wallie [Courthope?] once more his great goodness and will write 
 Much love to you all my dear wife and to my Mother 
 Geoff
