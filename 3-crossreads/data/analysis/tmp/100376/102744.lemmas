 Menton , Mont Carlo . We got a splendid recept all along the way . A stop was made by the train on the sea shore near Menton . No sooner had the train stop than out jump the men in hundr and strip themselv quick they plung into the brini . We pass Mont Carlo in the dark . About 10 p.m. we enter Itali . Sept. 30th When we awok this morn we found ourselv well into Itali at a place call Savona where we were taken in charg by the Electric engin . Veri high mountain in these part . Had a long stop at Geneva . It is strang to see the mani larg town built high up on these mountain . These mountain side are well cultiv appar with vine and fruit tree . The hous are all paint a yellow or pink colour . They look cheap like . Even paint are done on the hous but to my mind they are not artist . The Italian have a peculiar way of wave their hand . They hold up their hand with the back to you and bring their finger forward
