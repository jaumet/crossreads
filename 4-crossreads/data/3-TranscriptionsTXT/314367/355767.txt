We are abreast of Marybro (Double Island) as I write this - Sunday eveg or Monday morning seems about our time - all being well -The more one reflects the more one sees that the Pacific is washed out - The Grantala is discharged - The Submarine AE2 has gone home - All Imperial!! Naval men (Why Imperial, why not British?) have been recalled - One destroyer only is in Sydney we believe - No war ships are here - What on earth is left for us to do? Nothing save dull, deadly, ordinary routine - I'm off =Talking things over with others I touched on a point that many agree with - Is it a good thing to denude Australia of its fighting men in toto? - especially of its volunteer crowd - we can & may do it but is it advisable in a young land which wants population? - Why not compel the villages of the cities of Great B & Ireland to drill & fight & save our men for their own country - There must be tens of thousands of hoodlums at home who should be rounded up, trained & given a fighting chance -
