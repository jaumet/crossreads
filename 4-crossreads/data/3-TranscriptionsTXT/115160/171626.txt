 Dear Bessie, 
 I am so very sorry to have to put your visit off from next Sunday as I have been waiting for you to come up here quite a long time now. 
 But we always go to my sisters&#39; place at Ashfield the Sunday before Xmas day, so I do hope you will not mind, but if you will just drop me a line&nbsp;&amp; let me know what other time will suit you after Sunday I will promise to keep that day clear for you. &nbsp;I did not answer your letter sooner Bess, as I have been trying to put our visit off but could not manage it. 
 I was very sorry to hear that your Mum was not well again, but hope she is much better ere this. &nbsp;How is your head now. Strange to say I had a terrific headache these last days as well and even today it is not right. 
 Well, Bessie &nbsp;my dear, I will manage&nbsp;to slip in to see you before or on Xman eve whichever day I may be in town. &nbsp; 
 Give my love to your dear Ma &amp; take heaps for your own dear self&nbsp; 
 I am  with  your loving friend, 
 Ethel xxx
