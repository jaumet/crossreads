<p>December 1916<br/>23rd    The weather has been very miserable to-day raining &amp; blowing hard.  I have been on light duties but we finished work at dinner time in order to get our gear packed up.  Fritz has been shelling fairly hard all day &amp; has sent a lot of his high Explosive schrapnell over our camp, causing a few slight casualties.<br/>24th   Reveille at 4 a.m. this morning &amp; after our gear had been packed up &amp; blankets loaded on wagons we moved of at about 8 o'clock &amp; proceeded to the Quarry station, where we entrained &amp; left at 10.15 A.M.  Before we left camp we were inspected by the C.R.E. Col. Carey</p>
