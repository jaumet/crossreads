  
 & the post is closing-  If we do go to Aldershot by any chance the first thing I shall do will be to go out to Hampstead-  I was so hoping we would go to Sydney first I might have had a chance of seeing you-  It would have made things easier-  However come what may you can rest assured I'll do my duty- Please give my love to all the family-  All my belongings such as they are are stowed at Archibald Clarke & Sons. Good-bye Father I'll write every chance I get- Fondest love to you Your affectionate son Gilbert McMillan P.S.  I have given your name & address as my next of kin- My number is 13/604 11th regiment -New Zealand Mounted Rifles
