<p>[19 &ndash; 20 September 1914]</p>
<p>With reference to AE1 it has since been heard after our arrival again at Rabaul, Simpson's Haven, on Sat at 4pm, that a small steamer about 150 tons was found on a reef partly buried. She is supposed to have come from Wilhelmshafen with reinforcements, from reinforcements, from Germans and some natives and on board was found  the working of a Nordenfelt Gun and several empty 1 pounder shells which had been fired. It is conjecture that she may have attacked the submarine and sunk her. The gun had been loaded.</p>
<p>Lieut Jackson captured a govt. steamer in a bay and fitted a 3 pounder gun on her. She is used now patrolling and will serve the purpose splendidly.</p>
<p>The troops in the Berrima escorted by the i.e. two flagships "Australia" and  [indecipherable] are to go to Wilhelmshafen on Tues. 22nd. Sept. The idea is to destroy fortifications and stores. Possibly a garrison may be left in charge. But occupation is not the main object.</p>
<p>The Governor of German New Guinea which includes all the German possessions in the Pacific except Samoa, which has already been taken, is to give himself up today Mon 20th Sept.</p>
<p>If the surrender does actually include all these possessions it is a great haul. But we do not know if this is really</p>
