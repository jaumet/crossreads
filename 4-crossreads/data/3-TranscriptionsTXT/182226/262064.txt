Friday 11 February, 1916
Felt very off in the morning but bucked up in the afternoon.
Our tucker was of the starvation order again today, tea & dry bread for dinner & no spuds in the stew for breakfast.
It has been a beautiful clear day today, from our drilling ground at the trenches we could look over some 10 miles of sand hillocks & desert bush to the dark purple ribbon of the canal, it is most distinct, you can clearly see where it widens out at the Bitter Lakes with the town of Ismalia there still further in the distance. At present there is a cargo steamer lying at Ferry Post while the 4 funnels & tapering masts of a large cruiser peep shyly over the smooth summit of a far distant sand dune while the mutter of her guns floats fitfully to our ears on the heavy desert air.Further to the South on the Suez side the land rises to the nearest approach we can see to a purple line of hills. Such is our piece of desert scenery from pinchgut.
