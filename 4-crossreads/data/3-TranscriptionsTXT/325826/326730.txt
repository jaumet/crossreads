Pension Wales.          Recd 19.4.16 initials.Cairo.March 13th. 1916.My own dear Home People,There is a mail advertised to go on the 16th. but one dare not leave it till just the day before to write, so I must write what there is to say now.  The rumour is round everywhere about all outward mails being stopped and the date now given is the 15th. March.  Some say that it has been publicly given out in some battalions, someone from Ismailia & another person from Alexandria say that it has been published in those papers.  One does not know what to believe.  There is a great unrest here among the troops, every soldier that one speaks to is sure he is moving presently and nearly all of them have it that it is to France they go, though some say it may be Constantinople.I have just had the idea dawn on me that it will affect me here too if Rid & Wal should be moved as they seem to feel certain.  Rid at any rate will be, belonging as he does to the Artillery.  I have great hopes of Wal being one of those whose duty it will be to stay in Egypt for certainly there must be some.  We don't know whether to think Le will be moved or not for a time.  It is all an uncertainty isn't it?  And we can only leave these precious boys of ours in God's hand after all.  There is great hope over here now of some end of the war being in view now, dear People; people who know something of the events are so much more cheerful lately and think a few months will finish it, and who knows but what you'll have all four of your children come trooping back before long turning "Cairnleath" into a proper babel.
