<p>not relish the job.  I can assure you all through the day the enemy kept dropping shells around the camp. Shelling a Dressing Station is not a sportman-like action. I noticed two of Fritz' observation balloons up &amp; of course with their powerful glasses the observers can easily see what the camp is. The cars &amp; red cross flags must easily be seen. Very often we all had to run like blazes out in the open fields when shells were coming a trifle too near to be pleasant. One must laugh at the comical scene, officers &amp; men running for their lives.  It is marvellous spirit of the men the majority were laughing &amp; treating the affair as a joke. One shell blew a red cross car to pieces killing the motor transport sergeant instantly. He belonged to another ambulance. One member of our unit had to be sent away with shell shock, the poor chap is only 19, too</p>
