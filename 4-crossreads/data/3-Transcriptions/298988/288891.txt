<p>at Grove Park, Kent &amp; they made me very welcome, taking me around the beautiful Parks shrubberies &amp; a lot of nice sceneries.  They asked me to stay all night &amp; made me very comfortable.  Young Mr Henderson &amp; Miss Henderson then came one evening &amp; had dinner with me at the Imperial &amp; went to Daly's Theatre, "Betty" afterwards with me.  He had only been back from France a few days where he had been for 9 months &amp; was wounded.  He is to return there when better.  The rest of my time I spent working.</p>
<p>July 26th (Monday)  Leaving London today after 3 weeks stay &amp; we are bound for Middlesbrough in the North sea up past Scarborough &amp; Whitby where the German Naval raids were made.  There was 7 ships sank yesterday off Lowestoft, which point we pass on the way, but as the submarines responsible will now get hunted out of that we ought to be pretty safe.</p>
<p>July 27th<br/>Arrived Middlesbrough after an uneventful trip.  Passed a lot of our Fleet &amp; Trawlers sweeping for mines &amp; saw two of them rake one up right alongside of us.</p>
<p>Aug 15th (Sunday)<br/>Left Middlesbrough for Australia via Durban at 5 a.m. with 4,500 tons of steel rails for the Victorian Railway Commissioners.  Middlesbrough is chiefly an iron smelting &amp; ship building place.  They are at present building Monitors with shallow draught &amp; big 9.2 guns, as big almost as the ship itself, one on each &amp; an anti-aircraft gun on the poop.  They build these at the rate of one a week</p>
