<p>Cold &amp; Frosty. Got a chance of seeing a bit of country in a Motor Transport &ndash; so forfeited my days sleep &ndash; Had a run as far as the Somme &ndash; around Happy Valley &ndash; Suzanne &ndash; Bray &ndash; Meaul &amp; outskirts of Albert. Got permission to inspect a big Aerodrome &ndash; where there was hundreds of planes &ndash; ascending &amp; descending &amp; in all stages of repair. Also saw a big German interment camp &ndash; where several hundred Fritzs  - they mostly work on roads &amp; look a jolly sight better than our own boys.</p>
