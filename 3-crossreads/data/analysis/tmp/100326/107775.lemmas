 25/9/15 on Friday next . Glad to have an Australian back although Smyth veri fair . HQ say noth can come up to our men , and mention the Territori 's want of "gut " so veri evid here . Vacat a trench when attack by mass battalion 15000 strong . Our hold on ? 5000 kill and wound by our artilleri m.g .s and then Australian leap out to meet them . No "vacat " for them . Insect here not veri numer . Two speci of ant somewhat like bulldog varieti alway at war with each other . Occasion dragon fli to be seen . Myriad of small hous flys most persist . Kept down veri much by the scrupul thorough of the sanitari arrangemt . The blowfli a small genus with beauti golden belli . A gay bird for the loathsom banquet he come from . Saw one corps , good look young fellow , he had been cover with these golden flys and just of a blaze of gold . Crawl in one eye and out the other ! Hear Luscomb is a prison of war at Constantinopl .
