 E-9 St Patrick's Hospl Malta 21/8/1915 Dear Mother Thank you very much for good wishes   &amp; cash which I received safely.  You will see by above that my address is changed.  St Patrick's is a Camp Hospital to make rooms for fresh cases in the usual ones.  My leg is very nearly healed   &amp; is not at all sore but the muscles prevent me from walking without crutches.  I expect it will be three or four months getting right.  I may go to England or return to Australia soon but if I could get back to the front there would be a good chance of getting a commission as I know several others have done. &nbsp;
