Well we got to Kawieng about 3 pm - Thorold - the administrator came off - At 4 pm we put out to sea without having landed - The weather was perfect - Once & again I saw  those wonderful seascapes that attracted me so much the first time - To day - they were clear cut as cameos & as beautiful as ever - Seen thro driving mist with the roar & lash of the combers I think the effect is even more magical -  We are chasing the Destroyers with a message for them & wireless went - crack - crack - every 15 minutes all night until we got them at dawn - We have changed our course & are said to be going back to ?Rabaul - War without wireless seems impossible -
Monday Jan 25-15  Up at 6 am Cocoa - Then I read - I always read if its cool enough - Reading the words of great writers
