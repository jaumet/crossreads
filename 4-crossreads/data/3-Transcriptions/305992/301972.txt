<p>24  [Apr]<br/>Fine weather prevails so far &amp; making a splendid headway.<br/>N.B. Re the Malwa it is a frequent occurance of cargo boats colliding in convoys with bad results in troop transports it would be awful.</p>
<p>26<br/>Naval Commodore on Kaisar I Hind continually at signals from daylight to dark.<br/>10 pm Malwa altered her course the wrong way per zig zag &amp; narrow escape of ramming the Indarra (the 2nd time this ship has made a mistake &amp; near collision).</p>
<p>27<br/>Similar occurance at 6 am &amp; 11 am this day. Malwa within 400 yards abreast altered his course 20&deg; to port instead of starboard. To avoid collision Indarra turned sharp around Malwa. Censured by Commodore by signals.<br/>Noon All transport 8 miles off Alexandria formed in single line 400 yards apart destroyers ahead side &amp; astern. Hydroplane 50 miles out to meet us. 15 miles out trawlers monotors as extra escort whilst in single file steaming through swept channel.<br/>2 pm Dropped [anchor] in harbor<br/>4.30 pm Moored to transport wharf.<br/>The convoy brought from Marsailles 600 officers, 3000 Jewish troops, 4000 Indians from the West battlefield &amp; 60 sisters &amp; nurses for Mesepotamia &amp; Palastine.</p>
