<p>Sunday, 5 September, 1915<br/>Feeling better still weak.  Part of the 6th Bde landed to-day, it was true about the Southlands being torpedoed &amp; the Brigadier was killed.  I soon got plenty of tent mates chaps from the 1st L.H. &amp; the 11th &ndash; the 11th &amp; 12th L.H. have been split up and are acting as reinforcements for the 1st Bde.  We had some casualties to-day that were typical of newly landed Austs.  A party of the 20th Batt went out to look for the machine gun sniper a sergeant in charge but so zealous were they that they exposed themselves and the result was six of them got badly wounded and we had to go out at night to bring them into our hospital.</p>
<p>Monday, 6 September, 1915<br/>Discharged from hospital to-day and as the [indecipherable]th Bde landed last night I asked permission to go around to them in Monash Gully expecting to see my brothers who are in the 6th Field Amb, I found the amb. alright but got a shock &ndash; when I heard my brothers were not there, one man told me that one of them was on the boat that was torpedoed, after a lot of enquiries I found a friend there and he informed me that they were both in C. Sect, and they were due to arrive at night. I was surprised at the number of men I knew in the 6th Bde, one thing we all notice about these new Bdes, that is their confidence to hear them speak out most think Gallipoli will be taken by them  - Returned home made a dug out then at night went down for a swim.</p>
