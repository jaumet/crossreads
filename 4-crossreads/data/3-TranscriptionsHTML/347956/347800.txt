<p>Dec 2nd</p>
<p>Wed 2nd<br/>Was awakened at 3.40 AM to go on the bridge.  had a cup of tea going on duty; was surprised when I woke to find we were still at anchor. the cause of the delay being no pilot available.  I witnessed one of the prettiest sunrises I have ever seen this morning.</p>
<p>The bow of this boat is barricaded with ropes, pieces of iron etc. for the troopers to take shelter behind going through the canal.  It was rather cool during the night &amp; all men on duty wore overcoats; at 6 AM a fleet of ships were sighted on the horizon which proved to be Indian troop ships &amp; a big French <strike>battleship</strike> cruiser escorting them.  A Japanese boat (the Satuka &ndash; Maru) passed us at 6.30 she came quite close &amp; we see nothing but Japs on board.  we were speaking to her by semaphore.  Creighton is on the bridge with me.  I believe the Hororato is held</p>
