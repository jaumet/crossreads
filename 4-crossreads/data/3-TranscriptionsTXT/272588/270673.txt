 Monday 11 March Very quiet on the front to-day.  Infantry changed over last night, but no casualties.  A raid about 11.30 p.m. on our right appeared to be in progress.  Only two casualties so far from R.A.P. Beautiful day. Our post is the easiest I have yet been on &amp; we push the patients on a tram line for about &frac34; of a mile. The country about is hilly sloping away to Ypres on the north &amp; has been much battered about in the Battle of Messines. 
 Tuesday 12 March Glorious day &amp; very quiet except on Hill 60, which is intermittently shelled. A beautiful day &amp; Ypres Cloth Hall, Lake Zillebeke &amp; a couple of ruined villages are plainly discernible on our left.
