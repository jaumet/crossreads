impressed we were by the picture in the illustrated papers before my setting out.  Bill and his six sons were but the expression of the state of preparedness to which the humblest member of the empire had been brought.  By jove it was great.   Now, of al the peoples only the Teuton can have left enough of the backbone to keep stiff the soldiery who must do the fighting, it is this backbone that gives to me cause for thinking that all the success for some time will be with our foes.  In times of peace it is very hard to obtain the services of a really well trained and sober set of non commissioned men to train others, how must it be now when all those who were worth considering have been killed or wounded in France and other places.
Yes two letters from Kitty, they will be answered when yours have been done justice to.  It is very pleasing to me to learn from your letters that my Kitty is keeping in such first class health as to her eyes and generally.   Good.
Cohen always was a man of good intentions, with the breaking of them he is freely paving his little block in hades.   I hope that you have not paid Buchanan and Smithers money.   Do not bother with them if they are not attending to your requirements.   Mr. Buchanan told me that he would look after y our requirements without charge while I was away.   It is pity if he is degenerating because he was getting together a first class business, to it he received much assistance from me, because his father was a friend of mine and John himself worked well during his younger years, recently he has been giving too much time to horseracing, which is all right in its way, but it is dangerous because few men can be reasonable in the face of success, being led by degrees to excess, unless he be possessed of that uncommon quality which makes him know that 'tis but the smile of fortune that gives him winnings, the average man credits how own cleverness with the gains, this is often fatal, leading one out of depth sometimes to drowning, this is the danger of gambling in any way.  Should you require to make a change ask Andy Watt to advise you as to whom you should employ.   But Mr. Finney can tell you most of what you require, and he will have no charge against you.
It will be good news for you when I write that during the two weeks in which Jerome has been feeding me my weight has increased by eight pounds, and the meals have been the most enjoyable since leaving home.   The rice & porridge in the morning are of the very best, the bread is first class, there is never taint of onions in the food, and no vegetable mixtures come before me, the little piece of undercut that is fried for my breakfast is delicious, and the rice pudding just completes my dinner.  My cook gets drunk on occasions, but a little stiffening in the way of my opinions upon such happening and the stoppage of pay has the effect of limiting his indulgence.
