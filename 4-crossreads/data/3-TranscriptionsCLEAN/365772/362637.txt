 My dearest sister, Yesterday was a red letter day for me I received no less than 8 letters & two enclosures besides from you Sister Josephs letters & Beres's card which took some deciphering. They were made up as follows 3 from your dear old self 2 from Mother 1 Dad 1 Ralph & 1 from Ulmarra the YMCA man got them from Cairo for me, they are fine chaps Lizzie, they will do anything for us, open up libraries supply notepaper instal pianos in fact anything that tends to make things easier for a chap they do it. The Government ought to subsidise the YMCA for the work they have done & money they have spent here. I am so sorry you have had trouble with your throat you should have had it done years ago, you are under a good man in Dr
