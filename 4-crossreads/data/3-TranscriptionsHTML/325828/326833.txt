<p>Tichborne<br/>20th May 1915.</p>
<p>Bitterly cold weather now with strong S.W winds.  Your birthday present of sweater very acceptable.  Have to wear 2 sweaters shirt, singlet coat &amp; overcoat with 2 pairs of socks to keep warm whilst I am team-driving- winds go right through a man, to his bones.  Leo.</p>
<p>My dearest Father,<br/>I must thank you for your letter of 16th inst. to hand on Tuesday.  Evidently you were interrupted, as the letter reached me in an unfinished state.  You had just written about my writing to you about the matter of the war, when it ended without any general ending or signature.  Thank you very much for your advice as to volunteering etc.</p>
<p>The leg is continuing to heal (the old sore on the other leg has completely healed now)&amp;without any more proud flesh so ar. I am still taking the blood-tonic &amp; it is working a great beneficial change in me.<br/>We have had splendid rains up here since I last wrote.  A total of 152 points have been registered here.  It started last Thursday night, &amp; all day Friday it rained without a stop.  It was a beautiful, steady rain- in fact by Friday night only 60 points were registered altho' it rained without a break.  Saturday &amp; Sunday were also wet &amp; every night this week so far we have had heavy showers lasting perhaps 20 <strike>mint</strike> minutes.  As a result the ground is thoroughly soaked &amp; the crops are growing apace.  We are busy sowing still &amp; have another 10 days work ahead of us.<br/>As to the war.  I have thought &amp; yes have prayed</p>
