2appears to be improving.I have not had such a treat for months as I had in reading all the home news contained in your various letters, and am pleased to see by Mum's that Father's rheumatism is slightly better, and I do hope the next mail will tell me it has disappeared completely.I have little or no news of any of our Friends who are in the scrap over here. Our Major of this Battery (8th), Bevell-Browne, has been promoted to Lieut-Col and given a Brigade. His place has been filled here by a Captain Spurge another West Australian and a good sort. A few more D.A.C. officers have arrived here including Tommy Swallow who is for the present attached to our Battery, but I am not sure what his ultimate job is to be - wish he could stay with us as he is a fine chap, and a very good gunner.Major Lucas is still in Egypt - I forget whether I mentioned Eric Lenehan in my last letter. He should be nearly home by this. He has my sympathy, poor beggar, having had such rotten luck, but I trust the trip will fix him up, and he may yet be back in time to "deal" out some "hate" to "John" Turk.II
