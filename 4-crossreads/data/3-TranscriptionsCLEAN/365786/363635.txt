  
 fairly substantial but the upper looks unfinished being seldom roofed over & is used as a place for storing everything from manure downwards - we even saw goats, chickens & geese congregated with the children on the house tops.  We had  dinner  lunch in the dining car on the train & arrived in Cairo about 5 p.m.  The distance is 148 miles & the train takes 5 hours.   At Ismailiyeh the line branches off to Suez branches off.  In Cairo we went first to the Hotel Continental & here we stayed for 4 weeks, but after that we were lucky to get a nice flat  with attendance & food provided inclusive  & in this we were freer & more comfortable than at the Hotel besides being about 1/2 the price.
