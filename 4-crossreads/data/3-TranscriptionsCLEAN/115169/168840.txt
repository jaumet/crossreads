March 8th at 5 am. H.M.S. Glasgow (made famous by the battle off Coronel and Falklands) appeared on the horizon, in company with our collier - at 6.30 Glasgow anchored abreast of us followed shortly afterwards by collier doing likewise - we were then informed that the 'Glasgow' had just been recommissioned with a new crew at St Vincent and that she was returning to her previous station
