we got out of the place quick lively went over to the billiard room had a game, Graham who is a pretty good player gave me 50 in a hundred for I am only a novice you know, at any rate I finished up by beating him by 12 points, after this display we went back to see if we could get a bit of supper, there was plenty of it there alright but the whole show was badly managed the supper room resembled a ticket office in holiday time more than anything else I could compare it too, why there was scarcely standing room blokes half drunk were running or should I say staggering about with a plate of blanc mange in one hand a junk of cake in the other the stuff kept slipping off on to the floor so you may guess what
