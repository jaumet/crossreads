<p>quite a good lot of tea &amp; sugar from the cookhouse; &amp; there is the Red Cross  Coffee &amp; milk too.  During the last few days we have only had a few fatigues, and no one has been called upon to do more than one a day.  I was out on  a wiring fatigue near our old front line position last night.  Tonight my job is merely bringing up rations from Clarks Dump.</p>
<p>Jan 10<br/>Our platoon is told off for ration carrying to the front line for 8 days; and I got the job of going to my old post, 5011, which is the hardest job of the lot being the farthest out &amp; jutting into Fritz's line, so to speak.  Its bad, because the sort of feverish cold I still carry with me brings the rheum to my eyes, and makes it more difficult than ordinary to see my way.  Still I volunteered for it, thinking the posts would go round so that we would have turns of the difficult &amp; easy ones; &amp; although this is not to be done, there is no use in complaining.</p>
<p>Bowen, who went with me, complained about my being slow, so I told him to go ahead if he liked; which he did.  At 3011, a post on the way out, I heard that he was about 12 minutes ahead of me, so I apologised when I reached 5011 for being late, thinking he would have got there fully twenty minutes ahead of me &ndash; but he had not arrived.  After waiting for ten minutes</p>
