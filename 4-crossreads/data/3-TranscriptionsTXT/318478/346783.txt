Dear Mick
Two Golden Butterflies skim gracefully over the House tops of Cairo.  I say Golden Butterflies because Maurice or Tim failed to instruct me properly in the intricate nomenclature of aeroplanes or they lost interest too soon.
These two beautiful Machines swoop, twirl, & describe beautiful curves in the air and note you that even the Kitchener Kite (Cairo Hawk) perhaps the most wonderful of flyers is impressed and keeps out of the way.[Drawing]I am about to find out if I go on board tomorrow or Saturday.
