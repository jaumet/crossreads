<p>Sunday 11/3/17<br/>Quite a mild day  Plenty of excitement.  In morning one of our observation balloons was attacked by 3 German aeroplanes and after several attempts they succeeded to setting fire to it &amp; destroying it.  Meantime the observers had descended in parachutes.  The scene was very pretty.  After the incident one of our machines attacked one of German planes but the whole time Germans  made a combined attack &amp; our machine had to do some marvelous flying to escape which he did.</p>
<p>During the day the guns concealed all around us (5 inch howitzers) opened out &amp; were firing practically all day.  Went over to the gun pit of one &amp; stayed there while she fired two rounds.  It is wonderful the way the air is disturbed by the report.</p>
<p>Monday 12/3/17<br/>Tuesday 13/3/17<br/>Raid on tonight  Commenced about 11.30 pm  During the barrage Dick   Watts &amp; I went over to see the 5" howitzers in action &amp; came away nearly deafened.  They were firing a round a minute.  They are new pattern guns &amp; throw a shell 60 lbs in weight &amp; do not require shell cases but they put in its stead what is called a 'doll'</p>
