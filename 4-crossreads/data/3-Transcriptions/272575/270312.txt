<p>when out on a march.  I can only give you a poor description of the place &amp; People.   Lack of Building space seems to be one trouble, here or else it is that these people are far more sociable than the majority for the houses if they can be called by the name, are huddled together, or rather built together and roofed with all sorts of rubbish.   The place is about as clean as a badly kept Piggery and the people themselves, are if anything worse than pigs.  There are a few that seem to try and keep themselves decent, but the majority, are absolutely strangers to soap and water.  When you write again be sure and note the change of address &ndash; I have not been issued with new number yet, so will still use the old one.   Give my Love to all friends &amp; Relatives, when you see them.   much for yourself &amp; Bet from your loving son Chas G. Pryce</p>
<p>New Address No. 3598 B. Coy. 2nd Battalion 1st Brigade<br/>Intermediate Egypt Base Depot</p>
