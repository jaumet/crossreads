RAID.
We got home after a 70 mile ride at midnight last night - all ranks very tired but we did our job, blew up 2 large Stone Bridges & 5 miles of Railway & burnt many stacks of wheat. I could have got plenty of mutton & Fowls but TIME was the essence of the Contract so only got 2 Sheep & 10 Fowls.
As a consequence the enemy are bombing us today. We could have taken many Camels but had not the time, it was just a quick rush there & back. My Squadron was in the advance & we went 32 mile the other side of the Railway line & first cut the Telegraph line each side of Station. All well built German controlled.
