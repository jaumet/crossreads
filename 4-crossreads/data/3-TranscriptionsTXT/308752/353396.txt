be in number 1 squad, so had first carry before dark. Fortunately it was very quiet during the night & our turn did not come round again till daylight. Our Artillery was giving Fritz hell, the noise was deafening.
Friday 22nd December.Very sad news this morning,  two of our Bearers were killed near No. 4 Post. I have spent 24 hours in the same dug-out as these poor chaps were in. it is really very said, more especially as this is our first serious casualty it was a great shock to all. The said event only took place half an hour before we were relieved, & on our last day in the trenches too. Proceed back to camp all are anxious to get well away from the Straffe. The Colonel of one of the other Ambulances spoke to us on Parade, congratulated the 8th Bearers on their good work & that tomorrow we would leave the Straffe & rejoin our Unit. (Met Arthur Holmes from H. & H. He enlisted a few days after me).
