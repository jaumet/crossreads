  
 is that I have been struck off a boat roll. No reason for this action has been given me and as late 1914 1915 1916 & 1917 officers are going by this boat, (the H.M.S. Orca) I have written an official letter to the Gvt. A.I.F. Depots in the U.K. and if I still receive no satisfaction I shall write to Gen. Birdwood from whom every man in the A.I.F. gets a square dinkum deal. Several other officers are in the same boat as myself. I have often been disgusted with the  A.I.F.  underhanded methods of different people in responsible positions as a private but neve have I been so fed up as now.
