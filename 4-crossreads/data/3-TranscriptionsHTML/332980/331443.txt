<p>Watten I passed a Bifur Board which indicates a Junction ahead &amp; which is a Triangle to a Branch line, I received the first all clear signal &amp; crept on to the next, I could not see it for a while as it was very dim &amp; all of a sudden I found it &amp; applied my Brake but could not stop in time &amp; ran past it an Engine length exploding the Detonator which is placed on the line &amp; is removed by the signal coming off, anyhow the French Signal Man was more anxious for some Coal than the Detonator &amp; I soon satisfied him &amp; off again &amp; did not stop until I was received a Red light at a Semaphore Signal outside of Vendreu Marshalling yard where it was decided where my train was to terminate as between Vendru there are several yards &amp; Calais, after a few minutes stop I was shunted into Vendru Yard &amp; left my train &amp; ran Light Engine past [indecipherable] Station &amp; into the Loco Depot, from Vendru [indecipherable] [indecipherable]</p>
