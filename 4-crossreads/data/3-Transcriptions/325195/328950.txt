<p>25.9.15<br/>Sat 25th<br/>At 9 oclock last night the warboats opened fire, also our artillery &amp; put a few rapid shots in &amp; at the same time all the  firing line opened up a rapid fire; I thought for awhile that an attack must be in progress for 971 but it proved to be only a demonstration but it was the biggest I have heard, it is rumored that an attack is to be made this afternoon or tonight on 971, one of our machine guns was taken around to the left yesterday in anticipation of some lively work; Captain Broadbent is our Adj from to-day on &amp;  Chisholm is going back to his Regt (the 2nd) ;Hobson &amp; McGee were on  the 'phone box again to-day; I was with them all this afternoon, the 'phone has not been fixed up yet &amp; we have no phone work to do tonight in consequence: Everything very quiet.</p>
