<p>1916<br/>Nov 17<br/>anchor at 11.45 am.   The "Captain Cook" followed us and took off the pilot just outside the Heads.   A girl on board semaphored "Good Bye and Good Luck".   I answered her as no one else seemed to know the code.   An officer then put out the log line and the boat started off down South.  [Inserted a photo of "The Log Line".]   The coast was easily recognisable as far as Kiama but after that it became a bit misty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt a little bit squalmy on leaving the Heads but after an hour or so felt OK.   Tom McCann and I went for a tour of inspection.   We found the entrance to the engine room and went down.   The Port Napier was a twin screw cargo steamer of about 10,000 tons with triple expansion engines.   The engineer told us that at a pinch she could do 16 knots but we subsequently found this to be exaggerated.   She did about 13 knots all the way to Durban.</p>
