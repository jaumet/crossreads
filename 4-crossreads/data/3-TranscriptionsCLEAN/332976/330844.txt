  
 April 1917 21st continued   We received the news to-day that the Anglo-French captures on the Western Front since the offensive began on the 9th are now:- British 14000 prisoners, 228 guns, - French 19,000, & more than 100 guns, - total 33,000 prisoners, 328 guns. 22nd   The weather is glorious to-day-   After parade at 9 AM. we were "dismissed" & free for the rest of the day. During the afternoon three of us went over to King George's Hill, not far distant from here.   It was here that the great push started in the Spring of last year - 9 months ago- & from where King George viewed his troops some time later.   The hill commands a fine view of the country for miles around, & situated between Freecourt & Mametz.   It is one mass of trenches.
