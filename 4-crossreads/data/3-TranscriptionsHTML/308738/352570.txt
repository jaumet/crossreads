<p>Dec. 18 Saturday 1915<br/>Got up &amp; went to Mena House as a convoy was expected with a lot of wounded.<br/>Commenced to evacuate Anzac. The men were taken off in small launches at night.<br/>All the mules that had done such good work for us were shot &amp; much of the stores &amp; other things were blown up before the men left</p>
<p>Dec. 19 Sunday 1915<br/>In bed all day<br/>6th Regiment L Horse left Anzac for Alexandra. Lieu Col Fuller was last to leave the trenches with 12 men</p>
<p>Dec. 20 Monday 1915<br/>In bed all day<br/>Our chaps did not like leaving the "Dead"comrades behind them.<br/>We all feel the evacuation was necessary, but it is hard to have to crawl back, after hanging on so long.</p>
