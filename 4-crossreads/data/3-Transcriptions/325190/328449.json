<p>Wednesday 24th Oct 17<br/>10A.M.   We are still in the train.<br/>Left Rouen at dusk yesterday, our train about a mile long, &amp; were not so crowded as before, thus I slept warm &amp; comfortably.<br/>Since daybreak this morning we have passed St. Eloi, Aubigny, &amp; St Michel, at the latter place noticing some baths for the troops with many girls washing clothes, &amp; hundreds of socks &amp; shirts hanging out to dry.<br/>Evidently we are on the line to Arras &amp; Lens, &amp; not very far behind the front at that [indecipherable].  Germans</p>
