Reaching secret galleries on Tambour warned him on no account to show a light but just at a ticklish spot he switched it on. Was annoyed, but one of the "warbo" a good big Australian with bayonet fixed rose to the occasion. "Put out that - light, you ? old fool". The light went out and stayed out. Interpreter called out to Turks and they said "don't fire". He told them where to come in and how but only answer was 12 shots aimed at him. Walked back along trench and with Slater could hear them calling out from their trenches. They called out "At ten oclock". 
Went back to HQ Yarned to Drummond. At 2710 went up trenches again and tried a little ruse ? dragging tins across his our front from C to D. Got about half way and wire broke. In disgust fired 6 out of revolver at them and went back and turned in. 
At 2240 "D" xx a nasty position to handle, 21st have Quinns Post Bloody Angle. Wire netting to keep bombs off

Had a nasty tumble in dark. Pioneers grading path left a step about a foot high. Cut knees open (wearing shorts) think also broke funny bone. Very tired slept soundly and was nearly late for stand to 0430. Went back to bed after and slept till 0830. Another man shot through brain not dead yet. Unfortunate that the only part of body exposed in trench warfare should be a vital part ? the head. Bullet struck a man's bayonet broke in two. A lovely morning. While at breakfast heavy bombardment started shells bursting everywhere and the air full of fumes. Dirt dropping from the walls of mess dugout with concussion.
Gully full of shrapnel. Cooks shaken up - splinters
