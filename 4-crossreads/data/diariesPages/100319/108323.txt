Pulled out at 10 a.m. to the Bde HQ to hear the exciting news from the General that we are to attack at dawn tomorrow. A busy prospect with all sorts of reconnaisances to be made. The 1st Division who we relieve appear to be pushing ahead on peaceful penetration lines and doing good work. Went back to camp to eat a bit of lunch and conduct a very hurried conference before getting into the saddle and pushing off towards the front line with Thewlis. Passed Chingnolles and there found the 11th Bn.HQ in a dugout where we got full details of their dispositions. This little village bearing many signs of German occupation is much knocked about. Leaving the village we passed a dead Hun his head covered with a bag
