<p>over &amp; went to sleep  again. Thought we were there until eight but had to get up at seven. One of the drill instructers came round to put us through our bayonet drill.  I had a narrow shave of getting one a bayonet through the arm. The fellow along side me went to sheathe his bayonet rather awkwedly &amp; pinned my cardigan Just graezed the arm. Will feel the bayonet soon enough I dare say. Certainly have no ambition at present. We got flooded out again last night or evening Think I will speculate in a life belt. Well Father there is a very good concert on here &amp; want to drop Miss Smith a line so will close. Hoping the cold is OK. Love  &amp; best wishes<br/>from your sincere son Clyde</p>
