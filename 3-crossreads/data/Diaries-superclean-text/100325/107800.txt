8/8/15
Returned to Camp at 9.40 am.
?C? Co fought a rearguard action attacked by the rest of battalion. I was with supports, country very good, a succession of ravines at close interval allowing the force to be spread out between "traverse" of rentrants and yet close at hand and compact.
Word from H.Q. 10 leave for Cairo now - Plenty of work in office.
Think it a mistake to be there too much as something always turns up if you wait
Jack came up; we had a few minutes talk then had to attend to about half a dozen different matters that cropped up just by going over to office for a minute
