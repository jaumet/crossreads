<p>thought of hearing a debate, wanted to go today! Men with power &amp; influence want to go! Men with the interests of the whole Country at heart want to go! So vital were the issues at stake, every class of men &amp; women wanted to be present so what chance would a stranger like you, have of getting in. These answers summed up the situation.</p>
<p>However the Sentry thought notwithstanding all this discouragement that he would make a big try!</p>
<p>Meeting a business man who would probably "know the ropes" the Sentry explained his desires &amp; then chatted about general topics. After a little while the business man said Wait here a moment I am going to see a friend about a commercial transaction &amp; I may be able to help you!</p>
<p>On his return he just handed the Sentry a card with instructions to go to a certain man in the "House" &amp; if he could not help you, no one would be able to! Immediately the sentry presented the card, the official "went off" into a temper &amp; very sharply said Mr [dash] has no right to ask such favors on a day like this! It is really impossible to do anything! The House is quite crowded now &amp; he knows it!</p>
<p>This was disappointing but the Sentry asked where the entrance was, this was pointed out, but not the faintest hope "held out" for him "getting in".</p>
<p>However standing still would mean the acceptance of "failure".</p>
<p>Walking up to the entrance it was greatly depressing to see 4 or 5 Australians, officers &amp; men, just idling there, having been refused admittance.</p>
<p>Just at the moment the Sentry approached the door, after discouragement from those waiting, a lady &amp; gentleman rushed up the stairs to the Usher</p>
