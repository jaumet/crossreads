<p>Sunday 30 September 1917<br/>Sunday once more, our 3rd on board and such a "thinking" sort of day.  H.C. 7.45 a.m., 5 sisters, then matins 10.30 a.m., very good address, "How shall we sing our songs in a strange land?"  Suggestions &ndash; never neglect opportunities of H.C., go to church services to enable us to do our work faithfully and help others as we are going over to do.  Always get Padre if pt. is dying, never neglect opportunity of saying a word to help if possible.  Hymns, Eternal Father, Peace perfect peace.<br/>2 p.m. visited gunnels &amp; took snaps.</p>
