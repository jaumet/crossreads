<p>we at times had a pretty hot time.</p>
<p>After getting into tents &amp; being issued with blankets we had tea at the YMCA here &amp; then walked the town. There is a "merry go round" here at present. Of course the shooting galleries etc were there also. The chief attraction was confetti throwing. It was a rather rough shop and of course Australian Soldiers got a good share of the confetti.</p>
<p>Tuesday <strike>31</strike> August 1st<br/>Up at 6 a.m. And then parade at 6.30 from which we were immediately dismissed. The breakfast was great, the organization being splendid and the only thing prohibited is waste. Eat as much as you want but do not waste.</p>
<p>We then had to arrange our kits for marching order (a pretty good job) &amp; then fall in at 10-30. We were marched up to the common (I think) and were inspected by a brigadier general. Then we returned to camp, had dinner which showed again good management. We then waited about to be told where we were going next day &amp; all arrangements. I was detailed to go to Haynes Park. We then had tea after which we visited Hitchin.</p>
<p>Various rumours as to the dreadful state of the camp were being circulated by the Tommies and so we were not much looking forward to Haynes Park. I was not very pleased with things as Pynor was going to Fenny Stratford</p>
