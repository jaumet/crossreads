<p>7 June 1916</p>
<p>Did no drill or fatigues today save take patient to ambulance from segregation ward.  Trio walk up through hospital grounds to Tommies' camp &amp;amp Gordon Hut  in No. 2 Div. Aust. Camp.  Boiled eggs &amp;amp bread for tea. 9[penny] Post-cards.<br/>"Soldiers' Christian Hut". The English woman &amp; the gratuitous snub she gave us.  Trespassing--- hut barred to Australians <br/>Same old tale.</p>
