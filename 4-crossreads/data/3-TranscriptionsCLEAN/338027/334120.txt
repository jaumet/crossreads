Had a half holiday & went to Mena & saw the Pyramids & Sphinx then went to Mena Camp where all the infantry, Artillery & Vic LH are.  I do not like the camp.  I prefer Maadi much better, the sand at Mena is as Nile delta & must be heavy on the infantry.  All the men out there are sick of it and anxious to be on the move.  I saw a lot of my Melbourne mates, they are all well.
Whilst we spend our recreation time in talking horses the infantry spend theirs in boxing.  They have a fine stadium & fight every night.  I spent an enjoyable day & returned late at night.
Sunday 17 January, 1915Usual Sunday routine, in the p.m.  I wrote all day & night and set a lot of views & few home truth - E -.  And Ess.
More talk about going, Heliopolos & Zeitoun this time.  The infantry at Mena had a last march a couple of days ago.
We all turn out & feed our horses with lucerne at retreat now, they are doing better now.
