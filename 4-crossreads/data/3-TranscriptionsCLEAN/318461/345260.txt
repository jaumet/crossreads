  
 night got it in the arm also three others one of the A.M.C fellows was one of them. fairly quiet today only artillery fire. Tonight will be the usual thing I suppose though they say fritz  is blowing up the Village he is in & is on the retire again. 9. P.M. the guns have started their infernal din again just getting dark. Thursday 10/5/17 had an awful night & a wonderful escape A shell burst in exactly the same place as the night before & a piece of it set a bag of bombs off that were on top of our little dug-out the din was fearful & the smoke also thought it was all up this time & expected the D-O. to fall in. However nothing happened but I don't want any more as close as that. Ltn Gardiner & 3 men were killed in a dug-out in the same way so we must consider ourselves fortunate. The two shells have made a nice hole opposite so if another comes tonight it will go a bit farther in. A beautiful morning again & not a gun on either side firing, quite a relief, but not for long I think as a lot of our Planes are up over us. Got no sleep of course had 3 gas alarms. just had a look where bombs went off Rifles are smashed Bayonettes are Broken & all along the side of the road, is eaten with holes surely a special providence is looking after us to escape being hit last night & they tell me its far worse down the front line, this is supports. Have to go for Rations 9.30. back to Village of Vaux. Pay 11/1 25.5.0
