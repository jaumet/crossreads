  
 Friday 21 January 1916 Commenced musketry course.  Taught how to aim a rifle & pull trigger etc. Of course I know it all thoroughly.  Heard result of N.C.O's exam.  I did not get a job.  Still everything is for the best and I may get one later on and that will suit better. 
 Saturday 22 January 1916 Musketry course all the morning.  Left Camp dinner time and came to Mosman.  Bought pair of spurs, 5/- & puggaree.  Had dinner Sargents at the Station. Sam called at Aunt Katies to see me but I was not home. After tea a mob of us and Mr. Radcliff went for an ice cream and a walk.
