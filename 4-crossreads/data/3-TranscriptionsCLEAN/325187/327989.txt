 Cold better  Practice Boat Drill last night & one Scotch officer is still shaking badly he was a Shell Shock case & was getting better but the excitement started him off again poor beggar  I'm more sorry for nerve cases than any. Took off outer bandages today, discharge nearly finished  ribs  a bit tender otherwise OK. Church at 10.30 AM   Saw a Whale this afternoon & the last of the Spanish Main. Ours is a big Ward with swinging Cots like Bassinettes tonight I found mine swinging- usually locked - consequently by sitting carelessly on the side [indecipherable] & all my property [indecipherable]
