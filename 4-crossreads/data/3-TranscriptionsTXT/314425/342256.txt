We were busy cleaning up the limbers for an inspection tomorrow.On Tuesday 3 big new blows were delivered by the Allies in France. 1.  By the British American & French on a front of 20 miles between Cambrai & St Quentin. 2.By the French under General Gourand on the little river Arnes N.E. of Rheims, on a front of 4 to 5 miles. 3. By the French & Americans east of Verdun. Very important progress was made in every case.
Thursday Oct 10. 1918. 1528.Fine but cloudy [shorthand symbols] I wrote to Katy Martin yesterday.
[shorthand symbols] I also drafted a letter to the Officer commanding this battalion to apply for my discharge.
There is a great shortage of good water in this village none except what is in wells for domestic use. There is a dam here filled by street drainage and it is thick black & filthy. So this evening we took the animals to the next village Halllencourt 1. K .7 away and there the water supply was the same source and only a little better in quality.Tonight I done some writing in a French farm house & had some hot coffee.
