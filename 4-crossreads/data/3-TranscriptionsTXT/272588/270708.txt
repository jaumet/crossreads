 Saturday 18 May Absolutely glorious days, now hot.  We indulge in cold baths daily &amp; enjoy them.  I think this is about a record no stretcher cases since the 8th Battn. has been in. More fires in the vicinity to-day.  Moonlight now &amp; aerial activity day &amp; night is great.  In number of 'planes up, ours are greatly in the majority.  We are to be relieved soon, worse luck. 
 Sunday 19 May The 8th Battn. was relieved to-night after having done six days in the line with only one man wounded &amp; he walked out. Still glorious weather &amp; the country here is a blaze of colour, buttercups &amp; daisies. The Boche has been shelling round about here again, but nothing close.
