<p>Disembarked about 9 a m &amp; marched 3 miles (must call them miles now) to our Base Depot Had a good meal &amp; were issued with the ballance of our kit Waterproof sheet &amp; cape combined Rifle Tin Hat &amp; I had enough to carry before What we saw of Harve it is a livly old place</p>
<p>Friday 25th<br/>Issuing the extra Kit yesterday was done more expeditiously than anything of that kind I have struck in the army. We marched straight through a hut &amp; the things were passed out as fast as we could take them. Had to sleep in the YM Picture Show last night Saw the pictures first &amp; then slept the sleep that is issued to small children &amp; soldiers Had a march about 6 miles with full wads &ndash; No we have no ammunition &ndash; It was quite hot &amp; the troops felt it. One has to put on a lot of clothing for the morning &amp; after <strike>t</strike> you have marched a while with the Sun shining you warm up some. The tucker here is the best I have struck in the Army. Went to pictures to fill in time before turning in</p>
