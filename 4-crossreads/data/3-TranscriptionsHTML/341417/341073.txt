<p>writer, for I sooner do a hard days work, so you will have to excuse me for not writing more often. Before I do finish I shall have to wish the Firm "A Merry Xmas &amp; a Prosperous New Year". I dont suppose you will be very busy there, as they are all very slack here. So I shall have to conclude now, thanking you once again</p>
<p>I Remain<br/>Your Obedient Servant<br/>Pte W. Rowley</p>
<p>P.S. Excuse writing, as there is no ink in the firm.</p>
<p>Remember me to all the rest of the Firm, also their wives and families.</p>
<p>A Merry Xmas<br/>and a<br/>Happy New Year.</p>
