<p>look on but how cold. My feet were like lumps of lead. I can now well imagine the scenes pictured of Xmas snow storms etc. How the snowflakes dance merrily along sometimes to cling to me or to go on to some shrub where it hung till it became part of an icle. Some were whirled away down to the gullies where the snow was feet deep. The wind made it piercing cold. We had a meeting of Canteen Committee &amp; fixed prices of goods on hand as we had to provide for boxes etc for transport. I went &amp; visited 7th Battery &amp; slipped &amp; slided all over the place. Mud &amp; slush everywhere &amp; the snow commenced to fall a little intermittently &amp; in places it was thawing. It looked a thoroughly Siberian Scene</p>
