<p>Can't get any change here or rather it is very difficult to get. We have an officer in charge of us now a small little fellow called McConnel who when introduced to us next morning said he was surprised at our lack of discipline. Wrote a decent letter to Melva and read up some bridging construction during the day and after waiting about an hour in the evening for the French parson went early to bed.<br/>6.6.16 Sick parade again this morning. Still raining and fairly cold and the rest have gone up to the bull ring but I s'pose they'll come back if it goes on raining. The returned at 2 P.M. in a terrible mess. It had been very windy and they had to do skirmishing in all the wet and their rifles and [indecipherable] were very dirty and they were in a bad mood when they saw us reclining at ease in our tent. They were sopping through but it cleared in the afternoon and brought more pleasure. During the day I did some reading and got my things in order.<br/>7.6.16 went out to the bull ring with the crowd but my feet were pretty sore.  <strike>First</strike> Directly we came in our names were called out and we had to parade at 2.25 for medical inspection <strike>only</strike> was very superfluous &ndash; the doctor (major) putting us through at about 3 a minute. We then had forms filled in of our age, place of birth, occupation, etc and then tea. Orders came round that we were to parade at 6 o'clock for the bull ring so we all fell in. Our little officer McConnel, was in charge of us and things were rather funny a favorite saying being "come along, come along". The whole thing was a farce and we only went up to our miniature trenches and relieved <strike>our</strike> a company the rest of the time we sat about doing nothing. I was in charge of a bay which contained a section of 8 men. Bull ring bayonet, company drill, lecture on fire control and skirmishing. Very cold out. letter from Auntie Sarah.<br/>8.6.16 Reveille late as we were late getting to bed. Bull ring at 8 to 2. Bayonet, gas lecture, saluting, sand-bagging. Afternoon spent in getting my things ready for departure. Evening letter writing. Rotten cold trying to force itself on me.<br/>9.6.16 Bull ring in the morning nothing else interesting In the afternoon we all wandered under a corporal into the sandhills and sat down until 3.30 when we were called to come and have a steam bath getting back about 5.30 route much shorter going by the beach and at back of mammoth laundry on road to Etaples. Went early to bed and was reading it being too cold to stay up and at about 10 o'clock the orderly sergeant came round and said that the draft to go away was to fall in immediately at the orderly room. We went down and found we had to leave early in the morning reveille being at 2.30 by which time all our kit had to be packed</p>
