out in consequence of yesterdays happening, as usual all suffer for a few. No bearers allowed out of camp in addition to leave being stopped. Sent on duty to Edge Hill C.C.S. Had a couple of packets of P.C's sent from Amiens one to Balmain the other home.
Monday 16.4.17
All bearers standing to, to again go out to line. Plenty fatigues to fill in the time. Fritz heavily counter attacked drove our boys back some considerable distance, but our chaps attacked again drove the Huns still further back than they started from inflicted very heavy casualties on him.
