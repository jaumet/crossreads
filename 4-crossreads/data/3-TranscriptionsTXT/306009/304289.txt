 1915 Apr. 13 Tue. Yesterday received a letter from District Scoutmaster George Rainsford of Kidderminster &amp; Dist. B. Scts. Assn. His address is 89 Wood St., Kidderminster. Still very busy. Have received 12 letters &amp; a newspaper this week. Learnt from Aunt Louies's letter to-night that it was appendicitis Kitty was operated for on in December. Feeling a bit crook to-day about the "innards".
