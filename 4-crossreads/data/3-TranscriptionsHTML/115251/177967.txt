<p>that residents would carry out their ordinary avocations in a peaceful way with full confidence in British rule, and satisfied with the ample protection such British supremacy was prepared at all times to afford.</p>
<p>A full copy of the agreement entered into between the Governor and myself has already been forwarded through the Chief of the General Staff, and I will now proceed to deal with the clauses to which, according to your telegram, objection has been taken.</p>
<p>Clause 3 stipulates that the force still in the field when surrendering should do so with military honours.</p>
<p>The Military Commandant, who is a Regular Officer of the German Army, accompanied the Governor during our interview, and was very insistent that this privilege should be conceded. The enemy has put up a gallant fight and was prepared to surrender, and as the granting of military honours was after all a small concession and means very little, I agreed to the request.</p>
<p>It might also be of interest to mention that the Commandant, who is at present a prisoner on this ship, in conversation with the Brigade Major only yesterday, informed him that had this concession not been granted he would have advised the Governor not to surrender.&nbsp; He further mentioned that trenches had been prepared and mines laid at different points along the road to Toma.&nbsp; If, therefore, the fighting had been continued it would have resulted only in a useless sacrifice of human life. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am, therefore, more that ever satisfied that I acted rightly in the best interests of all.</p>
<p>I would also point out that the country here is a dense jungle, and an attacking force is entirely restricted to the road as it can make no progress whatever on either side.&nbsp; Any military man who has had experience in bush fighting will appreciate the difficulties, and readily realise what a formidable opposition could be offered by only a handful of men in such circumstances, and how long it was possible the hostilities might have been continued.</p>
<p>Moreover, I regard it as most fortunate that terms of surrender were concluded on the 17th instant, as on the 20th I received the following letter fron the Governor:-</p>
<p>Vunadider,<br />20th September 1914</p>
<p>Sir;</p>
<p>&quot;During August current year I had given an order to the District Commissioner in Friedrich Wilhelmshafen to call in to the armed forces of the Colony in my name, a number of white men being members of the German Army Reserve. I have just received a message that the Lieutenant Army Reserve Lauer, has landed in Weberhafen from Kaiser Wilhelmsland, with a transport of men and has commenced marching this morning from Wimaplanting in the direction of Nanderlit to Nanlil (place A).&nbsp; I am sending to him to-morrow early the following order:-</p>
<p>&quot;In the whole Protectorate no more armed resistance takes place against the military occupation by Great Britain.&nbsp; You are ordered to march with your men to Rabaul or Herbertshohe<u> under the flag</u> of <u>truce</u> and to report to the British Military Authorities.&quot;</p>
