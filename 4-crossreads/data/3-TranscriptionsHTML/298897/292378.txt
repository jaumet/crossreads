<p>&amp; horse vehicles all going through a sea of mud.  A large number of German prisoners were employed on the roads mostly a poor lot of men, the worst of them being shown our chaps perhaps to demonstrate how easy they might be overcome.  All night long I could hear the motors going &amp; trains shunting there being no cessation in the traffic.  The weather was bitterly cold &amp; the men with only one blanket had a bad time.  Had breakfast at 8 AM next morning</p>
<p>Saturday 21st Oct<br/>We left Dernancourt at 11 A.M. wending our way through the everlasting mud &amp; being blocked every few yards by the huge transport on the roads.  Motors were passing in their thousands without exaggeration &amp; we, the new troops marching in the same time the old troops coming out made a tremendous mix up  We passed "Albert" &amp; went on to "Fricourt" now nothing but a name, no buildings now standing.  The railway extends pass here to the trenches.  Our march of 4 miles took us 3 hours to perform owing to the traffic.  Here I had my first view of the German dugouts we had read of.  The entrances went down very steeply to a depth of 20 ft or more into perfect rooms lined &amp; floored with wood.  In many they were lined with green &amp; red cloth picturing framing round the sides &amp; Electric light throughout, absolutely. luxurious.  These dugouts were plentiful many extending into one another, all dry &amp; fitted with beds, shelves, pegs etc.</p>
