Wal was as charmed with the inside of the Mosque up at the Citadel as Rid & I had been & also with the grand view of the town, for it is on a steep little hill & commands the whole countryside.  We loitered about there for a while & then came back to the Pension & I ordered ka in my room here & then Wal went back to his tent home. On Saturday afternoon he was in again about half past two and we went out to the Zoological Gardens.  It is a tram ride of about 40 minutes & quite an interesting one that takes one past mud villages occasionally & peeps of the Nile & plenty of camels & donkeys & those sort of typical things. The garden part of the Zoo is really fine & some of the animals extraordinary.  When Rid first took me there & showed me the giraffes I just pinched his arm hard lots of times to keep from squealing, they were so extraordinarily huge; now Wal could hardly do that to me so he simply went into roars of laughter & endless "By gums!"  You should have seen him! Sunday afternoon he was in again & we just yarned here in my room, & had tea here, till it was time for him to go.  He usually catches a tram at 10 past 5 that just lands him home in time for mess.     I should have mentioned that the afternoon before, after coming back from the Zoo we went to Groppi's, the place of renowned cakes, for tea- a wonderful place Groppi's!            Hardly what either of us came out here for was it, this gadding about, but I know how thankful you will be to know that we have had such times, & the only pity is Le can't be with us.
