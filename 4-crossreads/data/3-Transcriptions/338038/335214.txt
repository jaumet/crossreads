<p>While writing this letter I am supervising an examination of N.C.O.'s who are going for promotion. We have had to send a number of our old non-coms away for the reason mentioned earlier in this letter and consequently have to appoint a fresh batch. I have had them at practical work all day, and have set them a short paper for tonight which they are just at present poring over. They are as keen as mustard and so eager to get on that we have considerable difficulty in selecting the best men.</p>
<p>Still no word of our  moving out but I suppose we will hear as soon as it is good for us &ndash; We are having a very comfortable time here and am afraid we will be too lazy for service unless we are moved soon &ndash;</p>
