<p>16 Dec, 1916<br/>Bayoud<br/>Yesterday morning at 3.0 clock we were turned out &amp; saddled up, at least A &amp; B troops did &amp; at four oclock we moved off East, we went out about 13 miles to Zagadan &amp; waited there until three in the after noon until the Camel corps who were making a raid on a Bedioun camp had signalled "All clear".   I rode "Paddy" who is not doing much work &amp; spelled Dick who got over the rope &amp; [skinned?] his heels.  Some more reinforcements came in yesterday &amp; A troop got two.  Last year this night I was getting ready to emshie from Anzac.  Ill not forget that night.  The work loading the barge &amp; wondering all the while why "Beechy" [Turkish gun] didnt try to find us</p>
