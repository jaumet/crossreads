- 7.7.16 Friday
It has been raining hard again here all day but has cleared up this evening although it still looks overcast cloudy.I have just come inside from witnessing a very pretty aerial fight.3 of our planes have been fiddling about over the German position at Armentieres the Germans suddenly opened a terrific fire on them. None of them were hit however, after fooling about for a while ascended to a great height went on observing.It has been fairly quiet on this front today, although fierce fighting is still in progress further down on the Somme Sector.We are still working hard have a big Convoy every morning to go out at 2 a.m. to the various Batteries of Artillery. These waggons go right up to the Gun Pits. Consequently they always move by night. I have heard today that we are likely to be ordered out on the road again very shortly I will be very glad as I like it much better than being in a Standing Camp.

Last night turned out to be one of the worst nights I have yet experienced. The air was full of rain to cap all at 9 pm the Germans started a particularly heavy bombardment of our Sector
