<p>France, 11/8/18<br/>VILLERS BRETONNEUX<br/>I went out again this morning to look at the sights. The impression is just as I told you before. The prisoners' cages keep filling up as the last lot are emptied out, and put to work. They are given picks and spades and set to repairing the roads and railways; or mending their own cages! On the front, now far out, the brawl still rages, we being top dog. Without cessation our supplies and men are being rushed up and the traffic is prodigious. So is the dust. The lorry I hopped this morning was full of great big gun shells. The men on the lorry were a fine type of English artilleryman, kind and full of information. Their babies, these big shells, are their pride. The big 3 ton lorry can only carry 8 of them. They fly 22 miles through the air, rise 18000 feet burst on graze, "and only made a hole in the ground as big as a tin hat." They bragged, with loving pride, of their major, who, they said, was a marvel. He didn't need to make calculations, bracket his shots or do any of the ordinary things. By some uncanny magic he pin-pointed on whatever he set out to hit. Their admiration was good to hear. For three days and nights these fine chaps had been working without any sleep but what they snatched - half an hour at a time; but they were full of jokes. But then everybody is in high spirits. We hear rumours of success up N. and also of a great naval fight.* This afternoon, with intervals for a swim and tea I have been painting. I've just stopped on account of the failing light. We are told of great success on the part of the French down south. We, for once are having splendid weather. Gott is mit uns for a change. I can hear a Jerry plane, well loaded, approaching, so I'll stop for to-night.</p>
<p>France, 12/8/18.<br/>As soon as I can, I am going to apply for a board to get my discharge. I will, if this turns out successful, go to the base and then to England for more boards. The whole thing is very perplexing but I have come to the conclusion that it is foolish in the extreme to hang on. Were I well I should most certainly stick<br/>*A canard</p>
