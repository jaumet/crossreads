<p>Ypres</p>
<p>29/9/16  Dull and cold and miserable in these shattered ruined billets.  What it is like in very bad weather I cannot imagine.  The ceilings all falling in and the floors wet with rain and walls damp and mildewed &ndash; absolutely cheerless.  There are guns close round us and their sudden barking is a shock to the nerves.  During the morning the Hun put some shells in close round here and I found that my nerve is not the steady imperturbable thing of the past but that the once unheeded swish of  an approaching shell now makes my bowels turn to water and my knees quiver.  James is our MO vice Craig.  C.O. Crowther &amp; Stewart all away and I am in charge.  All the men are asleep in cellars underground getting some rest before tonight's fatigue.  Arranged for the baths.  There are three baths and they are kept going all day so the whole battalion can be bathed in two days.  This building was the hospital and its decorations appear to have been of a rather tawdry character plenty of gold paint, cardboard moulding and indifferent statues mostly of a religious nature.  The enemy trenches are only two miles away &ndash; this salient is a mistake without doubt.</p>
<p>30/9/16  Left at 8.30 am on horseback for Bde. HQ and passed through a small village on the road which is as badly "dinged" as Ypres.  Noticed the names of streets up in two languages &ndash; French and Dutch.  Reached Bde H.Q and found that the prisoner we were to courtmartial had been sent to hospital so we rode home again.  Passing the Cathedral on riding up to our billet we were struck with the huge blocks of stone that have been blown up whole by shell fire.  Coming across the square a shrapnel shell burst directly overhead but fortunately missed us. Spent the afternoon and evening writing.  After dark the enemy commenced sending odd shells over into the town  and we replied with a strenuous bombardment of dozens of guns that rocked the old town. After we eased he still continued to send some over.  This hospital (Notre Dame) bears date 1680 but the front portion is far later in date than that.  The men are all on fatigue at night and the junior officers accompany them.  They trudge off cheerfully.</p>
