Gifts were distributed. Practically nothing else but tobacco & cigarettes - no earthly use. Had a very merry dinner in the Sergeant's Mess in the evening. Escaped early from the Dinner & went into Cairo. Town crowded with troops (some the worse for booze). A few rowdy chaps pinched a motor car & burnt it in the street while others sacked some houses of ill fame & threw furniture etc. into the street. Plenty of military police but no use at all. Pretty disgusting.
