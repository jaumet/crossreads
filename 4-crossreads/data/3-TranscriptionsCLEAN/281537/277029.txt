Had to rouse our stretcherbearers up today for casually getting a man buried before we really knew he was dead!  Man of 24th got bullet in head.  SBs took him direct to our pioneer grave digger who promptly put him into a readymade grave & filled it up ready for Padre on his next visit.  All done without any doctor seeing the alleged corpse - though no doubt the chap was dead enough. A case 2 days ago man with brains protruding from wound lived 24 hours.  Inquiries into this other case seem to show that the chap had his brains pretty well scooped out.  Still our stretcherbearers are too damned casual.  Another instance of laziness - a man dropped hit. S B walks along turns him over says "Oh he's dead.  It's a job for the Pioneers to shift him" and left the chap
