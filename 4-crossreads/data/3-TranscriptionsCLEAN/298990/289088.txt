  
 Longueval - Fricourt 22/11/16  fog and we resumed wandering again but could not see more than a few feet in front until we struck the road when we made for D.H.Q and got a guide.  He also lost us and last we reached the camp.  Frew took over command of the 24th Battn from me and after breakfast I went over to my old tent and found them all cleared out.  The next spasm was to walk to Fricourt which makes about 30 miles I covered on foot altogether.  Pushed on along the railway line and eventually staggered into camp covered with the sweat of faintness, 4 days growth of beard and inches of mud.  They gave me some whiskey and soon made me feel better. In huts again. Slept after lunch and then walked down for a hot bath which was a shower and lovely. Found one of my kitbags has disappeared and roused up all concerned.  Plenty of letters and papers now here and a degree of comfort.  We talk over the battles we have fought and so on and I must say that the last 24 hours have been about the most strenuous ever experienced by me.  Everyone very much engaged in letter writing and glad to be out safely from our second bout in the Battle of the Somme.  The mud round here is also very bad and quite an army is ever working on the road sweeping and mending.  Dark early and a cold evening followed.  Very rarely have been as dog tired and weary as tonight the last 24 hours has indeed been most strenuous.  Every muscle had an ache but it was not long before we all were fast asleep in our valises.  It is delicious to get into pyjamas once more.  The men appreciate this rest and change.  The night was intensely cold but I slept as snug as could be. 
 23/11/16  Breakfast in bed.  Shaving involved the removal of long black bristles a quarter of an inch long, the growth of these last days. At 11am turned out smart and clean in best uniform cap leggings and spurs.
