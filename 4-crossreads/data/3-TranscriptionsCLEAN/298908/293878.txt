  
 bad but us they catch the "Diggers" for such trifles as these. 
 28th.  Never felt so rotten for many a long day as I have done practically all last night, I had a fit of the "blues", & nothing could please me.  I just felt as if I wanted to be left alone.  The lady who I was with tried her hardest to cheer me up.  She took me to a dance thinking the music & life would do me good but she could not have picked a worse place for I can't dance & this only made me feel worse.  We did not stop there long so she took me home & there we spent the rest of the evening with the family.  I soon came round then & by the time I left I was in the best of spirits.  The last time I had a fit of these "blues" was nearly a year ago at "Rossignol Wood" just close to Ypres.  The only thing I can put them down to is restlessness & dissatisfaction with the whole concern & I am sure until I get out of the Military I shall often have them.
