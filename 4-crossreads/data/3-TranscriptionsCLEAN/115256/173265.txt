  
 Wednesday 6 January 1915 
 To-day was a fair "scorcher" and a spirit of listlessness pervaded the whole ship.  Hardly a breath of air, and the night seemed hotter than the day.  The muggy, tropical heat is taking all the energy and vigour out of the troops;  it is also causing everyone to be snappy, irritable and bad-tempered.  In a word everyone is getting on everybody else's nerves, as is want to happen when a great number of men are living under confinement and under the most trying conditions. 
 To-day I had a good conversation in French with a most remarkable linguist.  He speaks eight languages, including Hebrew and Arabic.  His French, as far as I can judge, is spoken with an excellent, cultured and refined Parisian accent.  So you may be quite sure that I intend to see a good deal of this individual during my trip. 
 To-night, a mere sprinkling of rain has made this stifling night absolutely unbearable - "hell with the lid on" as one fellow said.
