<p>I visited several fine Cathedrals &amp; Churches &ndash; La Madeleine, Notre Dame, Sacr&eacute; Coeur, St. Augustin, St Chapelle, St. Germain l'Auxerrois  Sainte Trinit&eacute;,Egilse Russe, Eglise St Louis.<br/>Had a look at a French Hospital at Auteuil in the 16th arrondissement (Paris is divided into 20 districts or arrondissements).<br/>One afternoon Mr. Clegg put a car at my disposal to go out to Versailles, about 16 km. from Paris. Went out through the great Bois de Boulogne with its lakes, grottos, lawns &amp; forest of trees. At Versailles which is a military town of fair size, I saw the Palace park &amp; gardens and the grand Trianon.<br/>Darracq Limited are no longer turning out motor cars &ndash; they are doing war work with 4000 employees.</p>
