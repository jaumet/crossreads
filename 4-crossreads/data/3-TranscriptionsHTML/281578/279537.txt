<p>darkness, &amp; overhead shells shrieked each way. It must cost him a lot for flares, we rarely send any up. We dug a trench 6 feet deep, then the engineers laid a cable in it , &amp; we shovelled the dirt in again, &amp; arrived back, weary, at 3.30 a.m. Friday 14 June Very cold &amp; windy today. Slept &amp; read papers during the day. He didn't send more than a few shells our way all day <u>Later</u> A Fritz 'plane was up before dark, &amp; our Lewis gunners had a crack at him without result. Later on, Fritz sent over some big shells, &amp; we watched them from our dugouts bursting near the dugouts of 15 platoon of our company, on the slope below us. They seemed to burst fair on some dugouts &amp; it seemed certain someone would be hit. It was funny to see some of the chaps scurrying across like rabbits to battalion headquarters, where there is a deep tunnel dug, evidently the shells were too close to risk staying where they were. When Fritz stopped, I took a stroll over, &amp; it was wonderful how some escaped. One chap was standing near his dugout talking , &amp; heard it coming, &amp; before he could crawl in , the shell burst &amp; made a big hole in the ground, not more</p>
