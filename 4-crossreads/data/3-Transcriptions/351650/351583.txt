<p>Dear Mrs. John</p>
<p>I've just had two letters from you dated 17 September and 24 September, for which thank you very much and I've enjoyed reading them immensely.</p>
<p>On the 27th you wrote from "Omrah" and the next one from Toganmain, so that although your leg hadn't quite recovered, I trust it had got much better.</p>
<p>The trip to Singapore was a surprise to me.  What the devil you would wish to go off to these rotten shores for, I cannot imagine:  and specially rushing off there, just after being only three days back at Toganmain:  and when you say yourself that the garden was looking so lovely.</p>
<p>However, don't go and forget to write to me occasionally even if you are in one of those places.  Singapore is the only place I can think of up that way:  but I shall continue writing to you at Toganmain as I don't reckon on your residence in the Malay Peninsula being very permanent.</p>
