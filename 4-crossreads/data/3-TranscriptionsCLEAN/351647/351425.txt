  
 feel so frantically keen on it, I'm still a bit down over Jim & also I have to go alone.  Madame Herault (who used to live in Sydney) is away in the country et ma petite Jeanne (de Amiens) que ete a Paris pour  deux  huit semaines  revendrai  elle retourna a Amiens dernier Lundi, par consequent je sourrai personne. 
 Interval of 12 days!!! *** (Have you any rows of asterisks in your book?) 
 My dear I've been to Paris & I feel  almost  as if I'd been to Heaven.  It is a simply enthralling place.  Even those first spring days in in dear old London with Tan didn't uplift me as much as my little stay in Paris.  It is a good thing I have the magnet of you dear people in Australia pulling me back irrestibly otherwise I don't think I could stay away from Paris & London for long.  Its the most beautiful place, Paris lovelier far & more fascinating than I ever even dreamed a place would be.  I feel almost ashamed to enjoying it so when so many of my pals have gone or suffered & when I won't see Jim any more I must have a light nature after all.
