20.6.15billycans of tea was brought up to us, the same at dinner time.  Sometime during the night one of our warboats & a battery on land had a go in, the flashes from the guns lit up the valley & hills here despite the fact that they are some miles to the South of us.  It was a fine sight to see with the search light of the warship playing on the land & the flashes from the guns every second or so.  Gibbs brought his camera with him & gave all his films to a Tar off the Triumph to finish off for him, but the Triumph went down filmns & all, so he is worse off than ever.  Everything is still very quiet here & only an occasional rifle shot & a few shells remind us a war is on.  Peak went to Heliopolis to-day, he has gone deaf I believe.
