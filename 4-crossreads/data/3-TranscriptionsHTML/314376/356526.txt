<p>215<br/>Bullecourt. About a quarter to 5 I left to return to my "home" (at Bullecourt) before dark.</p>
<p>Whilst here I attended a Communion Service in the 1st Battalion lines which were quite close to ours. Close by us were some old German dugouts. We were well prepaid in a visit of inspection made.</p>
<p>The dugouts were constructed in a hillside the interior was reached by steps. The bottoms were all lined with board and positioned into rooms with doors attached! Some rooms were lined with shells. The corridors too were quite long ones. Outside were heaps of clayey white soil taken out when the dugouts were constructed.</p>
<p>We didn't have much</p>
