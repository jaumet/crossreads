<p>Wednesday Aug 16, 1916</p>
<p>Occasional showers all day. A very heavy shower at dinner time. We were busy all day cleaning up the lines in addition to the ordinary work. After tea I walked over to Harrington a little Village on the Avon about a mile away. It is a quaint little Village with some very old houses with thatch roofs and most of the two stories high. In one part called New Haven there is a street of new brick houses. We also saw an old water wheel that was used for generation power for a flour mill. Further on we came to Bulford passing some wheat fields on the way. There is a Church of England [indecipherable]<br/> there. Both of these villages have old churches. I got 6 Post card views of the villages. The Manor House</p>
