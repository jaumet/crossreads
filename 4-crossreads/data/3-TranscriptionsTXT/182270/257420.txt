 Fine &amp; warm. We got off the &quot;Anchises&quot; 
 into the ferry at 10 AM &amp; went to 
 Wooloomooloo Wharfe &amp; from there 
 in Red X cars to the barracks. Met 
 Linda, M r &nbsp;Lloyd, Mum &amp; Dad there 
 &amp; then I got fixed up &amp; discharged 
 straight away. All had lunch at 
 Carnavon &amp; then yarned. Linda 
 &amp; I went on to &quot;The Terraces&quot; after 
 &amp; saw M rs &nbsp;Lloyd &amp; then on to the 
 Barracks &amp; got my kit &amp; came 
 over to &quot;Lisheen&quot; with it. I stayed 
 here &amp; its just like old times. 
 Linda &amp; I went down to our 
 lookout after dinner. Its just 
 too good for words to be 
 back once more.
