<p>In Action Flers 20/11/16 What delight to get a clean change and a bath.  In the evening about 10 our rations and plenty of water arrived per carrying party.  Fellows chatting in the dugout and the talk the whole evening was of shells big and small, of operations and stunts, of men getting killed and wounded and of the dead men out in front.  So absorbed is every mind in the war game that very little else enters into our conversation.  Heard tonight that young Camp had been killed.  Tomorrow night we look forward to being relieved by the Royal North Lancs and after returning to our camp at Carlton Trench we entrain for Dernacourt.  Many of the chaps will fall by the way before we reach that camp I am certain.  For food we "pig" it eating bread and jam Maconachies with any knives or forks about.  Food rations arriving for the boys tonight &ndash; plenty of food and water for each and some solidified alcohol for the Tommy cookers.  We all have about four days growth of whiskers on and are generally unwashed and unkempt.  Sleep in old blanket or two with wet mud off boots, pieces of food and God knows what underneath. Our aeroplanes buzzing over tonight.  Fritz has put thousands of shells the last few days into the ridge just behind us until it is just like a torn up heap of dirt.  All these shells are wasted as only a few lone m.g.s  are located there.  The weather has much improved and things are not too bad in the trenches now albeit sticky &amp; slushy.  Our phone wires cut again by shells this evening but the fault was soon located by the linesman.  We also ran a branch line out from my dugout to that of our excitable friend the English liaison officer.  Our runner was out with him when the bit of shell over the heart laid him out.  Liaison remarked "never mind its Blighty for you". Runners reply was characteristic.  "B.. Blighty" and he stayed on here to avoid being sent away.</p>
