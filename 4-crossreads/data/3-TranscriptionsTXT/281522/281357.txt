 20/6/17 Beaulencourt Being extremely tired slept in and had breakfast not rising till 10 am. Sent the Battalion out under Dooley for specialist training. At 5.30 p.m. rode out to Villers au Flos where a complete battalion containing 1 Co from each Battn. carried out an attack on the wood and portion of the village. Acted as umpire for the defence. The attack was slow in developing and was preceded by and carried out in heavy drenching rain. These woods are lovely and delight the eye with their delicious green. The folly of crossing open spaces was very evident but the right flank worked round cleverly and got the enemy in rear. In the chateau grounds is a little rock grotto and shrine and this property has been very nice in its time. Now the chateau is a heap of ruins. A B &amp; C Coys went out on an outpost scheme &ndash; night outposts under Bunning. Plenty of mud everywhere by reason of the heavy rain. General Gellibrand in good form. Nice bar  C.M.G.  C.B. D.S.O. and bar &amp; S.A.
