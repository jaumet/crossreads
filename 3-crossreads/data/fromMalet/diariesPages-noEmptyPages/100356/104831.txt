March 13, 1916 Monday
73 weeks of soldiering 
Made several trips up the town for different things met an Italian family who asked me to tea. They have one son at present fighting in Italy, heard we have to move on the 16th.
Got orders to catch the 12.30 train to Cairo with the prisoners with two men so intend going to bed early.
Aerodrome is stationed here in Sports Ground, they have a lovely take off but the skids are not doing too much to benefit the lawn, the planes themselves have been very busy down South, they are out twice a day on reconnaissence. 
Got a few letters today but nothing from home.
