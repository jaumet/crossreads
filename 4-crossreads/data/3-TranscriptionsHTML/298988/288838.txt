<p>the Indians were sea sick, but this morning they are playing jokes on each other &amp; then they all laugh heartily.  They are great chaps &amp; quite different to Ceylon natives &amp; Egyptians whom I never saw laugh <strike>[indecipherable]</strike>, the whole time I was there.</p>
<p>April 7th<br/>Passed the Island of Nikaria at noon.  This is in the Grecian Archipelago.</p>
<p>6 p.m.  The 3rd Mate &amp; I have just been entertaining Indians.  We started by walking up &amp; down the deck &amp; a couple of Indians became interested, so I bet the 2nd Mate that I would have 350 around us in half an hour, so I produced the skipping rope &amp; did a bit of skipping &amp; tried to get some of them to do likewise, but only succeeded in getting one &amp; he slightly amused the others.  They are great chaps these Sihks &amp; look, or at least their actions make them appear, like a lot of boys with beards &amp; they nearly all are 6 ft in height too.  Theres no doubt they have a sense of humour also, thoroughly enjoying a joke.  The 4th Mate &amp; Wirless operator are now talking to them &amp; there are about 150 there, so I lose my bet, but as it was only a bet, no money on anything, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>April 8th<br/>Arrived Lemnos Island 6 a.m. &amp; proceeded up Mudros bay &amp; anchored.
