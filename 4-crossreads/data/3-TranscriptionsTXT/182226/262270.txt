Sunday 5 September, 1915
One man killed in trenches. It is now getting very cold at night. A foretaste of what we may expect later on.
The usual bombardment by the enemy. We are getting quite used to this now & take no notice.
Am well again today.
Roast meat for dinner a rare treat, makes you think you are back at home.
