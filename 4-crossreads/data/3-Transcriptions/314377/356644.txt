<p>names that I well remember</p>
<p>One day I gave the boys of Southall Congregational Sunday School class an outing to Mr. Lobjoits meadows. He very kindly gave me the required permission to use them. How the boys enjoyed the outing! Owing to the shortages of foodstuffs I got each one to bring his own luncheon also tea Mrs. Lobjoit very kindly supplied us with the hot water to make tea with. After asking God's blessing on the meal we set to and enjoyed the meal very much.</p>
<p>Going through the gates we came upon a party of German prisoners of war who were doing the work of Farm labourers They gave us "good day"</p>
