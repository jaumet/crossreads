8th Raining heavily for the last 12 hours but this morning broke fine clear with a strong westerly wind which is fast drying the mud slush up.
Our old Brigadier, General Leslie was very much upset about having to send the boys in again so soon after their cutting up, he met our Battalion on the road last night told them how sorry he was that he had to send them in again but never mind he says you will have a good time when you come out, he wanted to take the whole Battn over to a YMCA buy them tea biscuits, but the boys reckoned it was too far to walk, that's the sort of a Brigadier to have.
Started out on our burying job early this morning, but we had a walk for nothing never buried a man, couldn't find any, other parties had done it. If you could only see the guns we have on this front, they are easily 6 mile deep if put in a row would be more than wheel to wheel, wherever you look there is nothing but guns, guns
