<p>one of my letters that I had been told that the Chaplain Capt McKenzie had been killed, it was not true.  I got quite a surprise when I saw him here.   I tried to find out about Simmons and one man told me he was killed.   I was not satisfied and asked a second, and he told me that he was allright and had been transferred to the Transport.   I also made Inquiries through the Base but never heard from them.   When I rejoined I found Sim. going strong and he asked me to thank you for the Xmas Wishes which he received.  he intended to write but I fancy felt a trifle shy.   The parcels have never arrived but they may later on.   The one that Mrs. Barker sent came along in January, and was opened by the boys.   They enjoyed it.   I am glad that it got through safely.   The weather has been cold, but not unbearably so.  I daresay that when the wet weather starts, if we are in the line, I will feel it a lot more.   at present it might be worse.   How long we stay out here I dont know and where we go from here I dont know.   I've no doubt that it will be to some nice lively part of the line but that doesn't matter.</p>
