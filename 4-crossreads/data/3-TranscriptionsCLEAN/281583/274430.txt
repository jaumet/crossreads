my feet being like blocks of ice made me feel fairly miserable all day.
They have approached me to take up Depot Sgt Major whilst at Montauban, over three Brigade Coys, & on the understanding that it is temporary  I have agreed to act in that capacity. A batch of 3000 prisoners has been passed back through our cages, having been taken by the Guard Division.
Troops still continue to pour in & everything points to a big battle being fought for Bapaume. At the present time Fritz is again shelling. Whilst our guns are heavily engaged in shelling him. Everything points to a heavy fight tonight.

Last night proved to be in keeping with all the other & we all very nearly gassed ourselves. The weather being so utterly cold we made a fire of coal & coke in our hut & did not notice that all ventilation was blocked. As a result we all inhaled the poisenous fumes & have been vomiting off & on ever since.
It is extremely hard to keep away from the spirits this weather but after a certain little indulgence I had I am not going to have any more.
We have had the worst day experienced & goodness knows what the night will bring. This morning broke without a cloud in the sky
