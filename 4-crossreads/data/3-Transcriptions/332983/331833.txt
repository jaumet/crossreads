<p>Artillery fire all night, section fire and salvos, This morning is foggy and cold. A few shells over today. A nasty accident happened at the base this morning. A despatch rider on a motor bike, run into a G.S. wagon, There were four mules drawing this wagon, and the motor rider hit the lead riding mule. The driver fell, his foot caught in the stirrup, the mule was kicking at him all the time, and to make matters worse, the leaders swerved, and the wagon run over the driver. First aid was rendered, but I think his case is hopeless. So you see it is not only shells we have to contend with. The Navy has just opened fire on Achi Baba 2 P.M. exactly. It lasted till 3 o'clock hundreds of shots put in<br/>8/11/1915<br/>Last night was a terrific night. Shooting all night. Rifle fire at 4 P.M. was very pronounced. At exercise last evening some shells dangerously close to the ride. They were flying all over the country. Inspection of horses, horse lines and camp generally this morning by the O.C. Details.
