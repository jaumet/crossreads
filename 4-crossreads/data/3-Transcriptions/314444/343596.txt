<p>Memo: Explanatory of letter written at Mudros West &ndash; Rest camp - 20 Sept/15 &ndash;<br/>The artillery (as well as other arms of the Service) had been through a strenuous time &ndash; and had recently been in great deal of action &ndash; Since the battle of Sari Bair 6th/7th August, matters had become quieter and advantage was taken to give some of the troops a spell and rest &ndash; thus a detachment of Artillery went to Limnos Island where they rested for three weeks, returning to the front at Gallipoli Peninsula on 6th Oct/15</p>
<p>Note. Will contrbute letters from Lieut Eric Lenehan &ndash; Artillery &ndash; Brigade Ammunition Column now in Sydney ill &ndash; and [Driver] R. Wise &ndash; Army Service Corps &ndash; who was wounded and returned to Sydney &ndash; Since discharged being found unfit for further service &ndash;</p>
<p>Wish to have my letter typed before depositing in Library &ndash; intending to furnish another letter later on &ndash;<br/>over</p>
