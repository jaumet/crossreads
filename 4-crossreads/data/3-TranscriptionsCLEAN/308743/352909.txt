 Stables per usual Cooking a bit of a trouble as wood is very green after break back to Reg Sigs.  The coms in British Army are still open & Toby is making all inquiries & we learn that they are good oh.  The boss has had his teeth fixed up at last the mail for Aust left today. The case against [indecipherable] turned out the right way for he only got 2 days. [indecipherable] must evidently have the folly of his ways and then to try & make amends for his arrears after tea I've been compiling a code & I also wrote to him giving him a graphic account of the different towns we have visited.  The Sigs all have had riding practice with jumps this afternoon no accidents. Lamp works at night I wrote to Eric. Bed  9-15.

I wrote home & to Nell and I think I really forgot myself for I really waxed sentimental & I also gave Eric a fait dinkum report of both Alexandria and Cairo. Planted road [indecipherable] & plotting for the N Bnd of left one first because was yards out but the next was right on it, the protractor was [indecipherable] had it explained properly until now.
