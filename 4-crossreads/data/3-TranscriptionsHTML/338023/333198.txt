<p>My Dear Mother</p>
<p>You will see by the above that I am still at Seymour, though, as far as communication with the rest of the world is concerned, I might just as well be in Siberia.Since leaving Addison Rd have not had a word from N.S.W. &ndash; not even able to get Sydney papers. Would not have time to read them anyway so c'est n'important. Still very cold. We crawl out in the rain and essay a little drill, then crawl under bushes &amp; stumps, light fires where possible, and wait for a change. The change is normally <strike> noticed</strike> signified by the rain giving place to sleet &amp; varying winds. At night we go to the camp "pictures," &ndash; very rough films abt 25 years out of date &ndash; the "stadium," where arguments are settled, or church. As regards the latter, we are well supplied. Pretty well every denom. has a building, making a little one street city all</p>
