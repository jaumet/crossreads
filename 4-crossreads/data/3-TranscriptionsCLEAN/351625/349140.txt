  
 B. Caldwell, Esq. 
 at their side in France with these helmets on one could stay in gas for hours & it would have no effect on him.  Don't go worrying about me going over too soon as nothing is certain here & anyway a month or so won't make any difference.  I am very glad to hear that Ingledene is looking so well & that you are so comfortable in it & only hope that you will get strong & well.  I am sorry to hear Bruce is so unwell.  I think he should knock off office work altogether as it is the worst thing out to pull a chap to pieces who is not too strong.  A couple of years in the country is what he wants.  It is just on time, this Y.M.C.A. closes so I will have to finish now.  This letter will have to do for all at home in case I can't get time to write to them individually. 
 Love & kisses to all I remain Your loving son Douglas
