<p>19 &ndash; E deM<br/>Melbourne the Saturday before we left. She has some of the lost boys belonging to the signalling school.<br/>Great excitement. A motor launch came alongside with 3 armed American soldiers. It appears that one of the engineers got a uniform off on of the American soldiers &amp; went ashore and deserted. The American in the meantime got a suit of private clothes and stowed away amongst the munition workers where he was unearthed during the day and handed over to the American Soldiers. They seem to think that Uncle Sam deals rather severely with these sort of men.<br/>Our engineer was arrested ashore and brought aboard still with the uniform of the American soldier on. Don't know yet how he got on.<br/>Some of the Miltiades boats took off their boys ashore for swimming purposes, but would not let them near the town. Of course we were not allowed, too much bother for our O.C. to do anything of that kind for us. We wanted the same concession &amp; after a lot of bother it came out in orders</p>
