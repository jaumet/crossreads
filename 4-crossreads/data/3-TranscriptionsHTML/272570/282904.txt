<p>over the parapet tonight. There was a very old trench which we made use of, thank the Lord it was here, as I don't know how we would have dug one. The night is fine to luckily, otherwise we'd get wet through, as we carried neither greatcoats nor waterproofs in the attack. About 11p.m. our weary bodies were revived by hot tea &amp; stew which came up. It was a God send, &amp; awakened us up a bit. At midnight I had to take a working party to dig a strong point, a pioneer officer pointed out the spot. Needless to say the tired chaps did not dig much. One of our chaps was lying dead near a knocked out tank, &amp; I got the sand bags off his back --- they will be handy to lie down on in the trench.<br/>Friday 9 Aug.<br/>Oh well, the long night ended at last, &amp; rations were issued at daylight. They were good, a tin of cocoa &amp; milk to 2 men, Tommy cookers, biscuits, &amp; the usual bread &amp; jam. Fritz didn't counter attack last night, thank Goodness. I lay down on sand bags on the bottom of the trench: (there are no sleeping possies dug in, of course) &amp; slept till 3 p.m., then made a drink of cocoa on Tommy cooker &amp; had a snack. A lot of Fritz's black cross 'planes came over spying us this afternoon. It is a lovely day, the weather is kind so far. In the evening a tremendous barrage was opened on the ridge to our left, &amp; I watched the white smoke from the bursting shrapnel. Our side must be advancing there. Then we got orders to be prepared to move at a minute's notice, so perhaps we'll have to advance again &amp; dig in. Lor' it wants men of cast iron for this game. No. 14 platoon was split up between 13 and 15, so we only have 2 platoons. I am in charge of No. 2 section, 8 men. Well, at 11 p.m. when we were all feeling tired, worn out &amp; and hungry, &amp; anxiously awaiting the hot stew &amp; tea, we got word to put</p>
