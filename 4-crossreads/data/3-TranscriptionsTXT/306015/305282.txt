Ruskin:-
"We need examples of people who, leaving Heaven to decide, whether they are to rise in the world, decide for themselves that they well be happy in it, & have resolved to seek - not greater wealth, but simpler pleasure;  not higher fortune, but deeper felicity;  making the first of possessions, self-possession;  & honouring themselves in the harmless pride & calm pursuits of peace."   "Unto this Last."  p 191
