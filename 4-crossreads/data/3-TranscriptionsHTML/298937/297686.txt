<p>Tales of Gallipoli<br/>The 3rd F.A. at the Landing</p>
<p>At Lemnos<br/>The 3rd Field Amb. had been practising with the infantry, landing from a line on to the shore, &amp; generally training, for some weeks &amp; at last the time had come.<br/>Previously they had been under the impression that they were destined for France, but they soon found that the Turks were their objective.<br/>The fatal day arrived &amp; in its first hour they seem to have left Lemnos for that now historic stretch of country round Anzac, north of Gaba Tepe.</p>
