Monday Mar. 11
Another Glorious day.
The Band returned to Camp after spending the week in London. They played in Trafalgar Square and the other places where the Tanks were selling War Bonds.
Arthur Foster, 3rd Miners Batt was too sick to come to work today so we did his work between us.
Finished Letter No 12 to B.E.
Tues. 12
Weather continues good.
Spent the afternoon quietly in my Bunk. At night had a a few games "Housie" and nearly won 6/-.

Hubby: And now, if you please, you are actually telling people that you married me for my money.
Wifey: Well, I had to give them some excuse.

Too oft the Jewel lying in our Hand
Is treated with contempt, is underprized
Till it is stolen ? then we understand
The value that we never realised.
