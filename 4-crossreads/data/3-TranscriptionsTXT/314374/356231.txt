(47)The machine gun emplacements on top of the trenches were fixed on to solid concrete foundations and proof to withstand any bombs and shells.  We were tired and knocked up and all lay down in our safe shelter to rest and were soon fast asleep.  At dark the Sergeant came and woke us up and asked for twelve volunteers for patrol duty.  As none of us volunteered we drew lots and I was very lucky this time drawing a blank, allowing me to remain in the dugout and sleep.  The patrol was out for several hours and had excitement.  Ran into a German patrol, and one of our men was grabbed and taken prisoner.  The rest of the men returned safely.
The next day we explored the canal.  It was a wonderful sight.  Picture to yourself a large underground river with tow paths both sides.  It was pitch dark of course but the Germans had it electrically lit &ndash; they destroyed the plant before retreating.  We used candles.  The Germans still occupied part of this tunnel about three miles up, so we had our machine gunners on sentry at the end we occupied.  Large barges were on the canal and on these the Germans could billet hundreds of their men in perfect safety.
We also saw the large vats where the Germans were supposed to have boiled down their dead to obtain fat, of which they were very short.  But this was not correct.  The large vats were used by the Germans to cook food for their troops, and during the battle many of them were killed as they were coming out of the entrance of the tunnel, and some of their legs, arms, bodies &amp;c were blown into these vats amongst the food, and were there when the Allied troops entered the canal &ndash; hence the false stories that got around.
There were hundreds of dead Americans and Australians lying about and the grave parties were very busy burying them.  The dead were buried with their uniforms on (it was disrespectful to take it off) &ndash; the only things being taken from the dead were their identification disc, pay book and any private papers to be forwarded to their relatives.
Most of our men souvenired the Americans before they were buried and some got great hauls of money (in French notes of course) as most of the Americans were wealthy and had plenty of money on them.  This was quite alright as we may as well have had the money and made use of it (which we did) instead of burying it with them.  I found a very good silver German revolver in a dugout, which I exchanged for an American watch, as I had lost my wristlet watch when on patrol one night, and I felt lost without the time on me.
