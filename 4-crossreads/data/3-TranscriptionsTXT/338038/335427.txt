VI came across an old photo of the Brigade tonight taken at Bailleul in France - amp; enclose it.  Unfortunately I was away with Maurice Fergusson at the time & did not get into it.  I probably won't know the old crowd when I get back there are so many changes - Col Williams has gone to the 12th Army Brigade, and Col R.M. Edwards D.S.O. who used to be a section commander with me in the old 8th Battery has our Brigade -Must say goodnight now with fondest love to yourselves & the BrotherYour affectionate SonTerence
