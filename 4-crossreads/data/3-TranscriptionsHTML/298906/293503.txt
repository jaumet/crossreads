<p>so far from what I have seen of it.<br/>24th. Went to the open air concert last night at Group Headqrs. it was given by a party of civilians who style themselves the Pierriots", was not bad, but not enough life in it, while we were waiting for the concert to start, an airman gave us a fine exhibition of tumbling, corkscrewing, looping the loop, tail diving &amp; etc. he was really good, &amp; once he went through the whole lot without a stop, started a couple of thousand feet up &amp; looped the loop 5 times in succession, then corkscrewed a fair way, followed that up by tumbling, &amp; then a fine taildive &amp; finished up by flying straight</p>
