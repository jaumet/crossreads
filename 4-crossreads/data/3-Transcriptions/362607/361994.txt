<p>24.11.17<br/>Dear George,<br/>This is the Hill on which the original Cathedral Stood It has only the foundations left to shew that any building ever stood here. The Present Cathedral was started in the year 1400 I think. I have to climb this Hill on the Bike. It is a nice Hill like Dee Why Hill. The River runs on the far side of the Trees which shew in the Centre of the Picture. It is 2 miles from the New Sarum or Salisbury, the modern name. How did you get on with the Pony. Did you ride. I guess You'll feel sore. I once sat in the saddle [indecipherable] in DonK in Egypt for 5 hours &amp; could not sit down for 3 days.  Well, George, Regards to all &amp; best of Luck  Love Harry</p>
