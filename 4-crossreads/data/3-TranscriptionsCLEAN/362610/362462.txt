Sunday 3 1916A similar dull day. Breakfast at same place in Oxelaire. People everywhere in their best clothes & turning out in large numbers to Church. A lecture & demonstration in the morning, followed by lunch at the place in Oxelaire. We then had to wait until 3 o'clock for the motor ambulance to turn up, & then we driven back into Belgium.I was taken out to Ypres where with a little difficulty I found Bde. H.Q., my dug-out, shared with Cuthbert, being quite a comfortable one. A large corrugated iron cupola, sandbagged outside covers a floor with an area abt 10' x 10', the max. height in the centre being abt. 6'. There are 2 bunks in it & a couple of tables. It is built against a railway embankment abt. 3/4 mile out of the city, & at night time the sight of star shells on 3 sides almost gives one some impression of what "the salient" really is. Altogether very unlike a Sunday.
