<p>My darling Eddy,<br/>I received two letters yesterday from you also kisses   &amp;  rose petals in Auntie Annie's letter. You are very clever writing such nice long letters   &amp;  I do enjoy them.</p>
<p>the camels here are very tall   &amp;  are not very comfortable to rise but the little donkey's are lovely   &amp;  I should just love to bring one home to you. We go for long donkey rides   &amp;  do enjoy it. I like the nice white ones   &amp;   usually get a good goer. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses from Auntie Eadle XXXOOOXXXOOOXXXO.</p>
