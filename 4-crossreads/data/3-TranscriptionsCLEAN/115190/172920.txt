 of  decayed   decomposing  Turk haunts me in my dreams. 
 (23 rd  Sept)  
 Awaking at daylight I discover a Jacko - very dead - near our lines & am very glad when we shift our camp  ^  on  to a ridge some distance away.  Here we open our first signal office.  I sit on a rock with my telegram pad on my knee & a bivvy sheet stretched over head.  We work like blazes all day & night as there is a lot of back work to make up 
 24 th  Sept 
 At  dinner time   midday  we are off again.  More rotten dust & decayed Turk.  The bodies by this time are getting very ripe.  We reach Wadi Jordin about dusk & relieve the 3rd Brigade who have on hand about 10 000 prisoners.  Signal office again & plenty of work. 
 25th Sept.  I am dirty & unshaven.  Dirty - God. I was never so dirty  before  in my life  ^  before .  I havent washed nor shaved for a week.
