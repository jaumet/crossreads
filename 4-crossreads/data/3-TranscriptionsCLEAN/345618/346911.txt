  
 Though fighting's not your special work, We know you're not the sort to shirk A rough & tumble with the Turk. You will not spare 'em, And you will prove that you're as stirk Where there's a harem. 
 You'll find promotion rather slow Unless you blow up Jericho, Or do some deed of dering do And win the V.C. 
 If that should happen let us know - Drop us a p.c. At times you may be short of grub, For Palestine is mostly scrub. You'll think of us chaps at The Club, While you're away. Conder will dun you for your sub, We hope you'll pay! Now - whether you be pictures [indecipherable] - Or in the ice-cold ocean swimming - Or killing Turks or kissing women I know one who's a limb Of Satan - so - in bumper brimming Here's to Jerusalem!
