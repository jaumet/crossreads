a French dirigible escorted us over. Sometimes it was just over the top of one of the masts. Marched through Bolougne up on top of a hill to a rest camp. Bolougne is a fair sized joint but nothing up to date about it like most European towns. The boys do a lot of calling out yelling etc. it makes things a bit lively. Next morning marched down to station entrained for base Havre. It took us about 2 days only about 60 miles. Nice country we passed through. Stayed a day at Rouen. Very nice place what I'd seen of it but weren't allowed out from our river side Promenade.
