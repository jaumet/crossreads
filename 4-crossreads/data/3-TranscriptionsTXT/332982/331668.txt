We did not get any more leave during our stay in Sierra Leone.While lying in the Bay the natives came alongside every day in canoes and rowing boats selling fish and fruit (Oranges 24 for 1 shilling, Bananas 1 shilling per doz, Coconuts 3pence each, Limes 3 pence per doz).The Boys were greatly amused by the natives diving for silver.
