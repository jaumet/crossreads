 [Sunday 11 June 1916]    Bayud  at 4 AM a fog came off the coast, &amp; we had to halt, everything was quite wet &amp; we sucked the dew drops to save our Water bottles- At 7.30 the sun came out &amp; soon "hunted all the Pearls of dew away"   By then the enemy had been alarmed &amp; we were fired on by about 80 men with Camels, 2 horses wounded.  We destroyed the Wells burnt the Native Mia Mias &amp; started off across the Desert home- via Og----a.  By then both Horses &amp; men were shewing Signs of fatigue &amp; want of Water- so we kept on, arriving in Camp at Midnight &ndash; 40 miles without unsaddling for 27 hours.
