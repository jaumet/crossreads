<p>about the ship now with a huge book entitled "The Commonwealth Year Book" giving statistics on all subjects and with that book he can put up some fearful arguments. Sergeant Dill is also a noisy member but he doesn't care about giving in when cornered Sergeant Pascoe is most telling in his discussions but he has an unfortunate voice &ndash; too pitched &ndash; too soft and with Fallick and Dill and myself he stands a poor chance of getting a word in edgeways when once the discussion gets going<br/>Sergeant Tyrell is also a local politician but he has a difficulty in speaking coherently as he had the misfortune at the actions at Rafa to have his bottom jaw blown off with a Turkish bullet. McSweeney and Campbell and several others are hopelessly outclassed</p>
<p>16th April. Monday 1917 at sea</p>
<p>Great ructions in the Starboard Dormitory the other night. The boys were skylarking about and their lights which were showing directly out to sea were not screened which is the usual procedure now a days. The Second Mate came on the scene and told them to screen the light or else put it out. They did neither and some one in fun</p>
