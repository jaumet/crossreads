November 191616th   This morning there was a very heavy frost & the water was covered with ice 1/4" thickFour of Fritz's planes flew over this morning & dropped two bombs near the railway ammunition dump.  One did no damage but the other fell on a wagon, killing 6 horses & a man, & wounding two of the drivers.17th   There was another heavy frost this morning & last night was very cold.  The ice on the water is now about 1/2 an inch thick & although the sun has been shining during the day it has been very cold.  I am still on the drain & have started on a culvert under a road near the dump.
