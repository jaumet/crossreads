 Thursday 6.1.15 (15) It was raining this morning when I woke up &amp; it rained all day. We had a bonza lecture by Captain Bray in the afternoon &amp; I played cards at night. We are a very sociable lot in our unit. Every day or night you will see different fellows from different wards playing at the one table. There is absolutely no clickerism. 
 One of our chaps was operated on for appendicitis this night. He was only attached early in the day. He is doing well. 
 If we had been a sailing ship we would be much further ahead. We have had the wind behind us nearly all the trip.
