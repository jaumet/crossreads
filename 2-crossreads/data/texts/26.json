When there is no difference between copy and original, the aura fades and rarity can only be artificially simulated. Yet, is this always true?

The article described this practice as an «attack on the commercialization of Web Art», yet it was more than that. With their thefts, 0100101110101101.org wanted to state clearly, on the one side, that the Web was – and should always be – the place of free access to knowledge; and, on the other side, that the digital medium finally turned the word \"original\" into a nonsense."

		"p" : "This is true, of course. Take a given file, copy it, and you'll have a perfect copy of the \"original\", described by the same long string of 0s and 1s. Copy it again, and again, and again, and you'll get the same. No loss of quality, no material difference between the first file and the last one. Put this file online, and everybody will make a perfect copy of it just viewing it on their browser."

		"p" : "If the difference between copy and original fades, the concept of the \"limited edition\" turns into a convention as well. In visual arts, limited editions were introduced with print. Printing technics such as xylography or lithography used a matrix that deteriorated over time, and the number of good prints that you could get from a single matrix was limited. Modern printing technics, photography and video turned the limited edition into a mere convention: an artifice that still made sense someway, related as it was with access to the means of production and to the \"source\" of a given content – i.e. the negative in photography."

If I have access to the same image file and the same printing machine, I can make a perfect copy of a digital print. In the digital realm, rarity doesn't exist: it can only be artificially simulated."

		"p" : "The Invisible Original<br />Yet, this is only part of the truth, the macroscopic difference between the digital realm and the material world that made some enthusiasts announce the end of intellectual property and of any cultural market at the end of the 20th century. In actual fact, the digital medium doesn't destroy concepts such as \"original\"; \"rarity\" and \"aura\": it just forces us to reconsider them. In his essay \"From Image to Image File – and Back: Art in the Age of Digitalization\" [2], Boris Groys does it discussing the difference between the digital image and the image file. According to Groys, there can't be a copy without an original."

		"p" : "In the digital realm, the original is the image file. Yet, «the image file is not an image – the image file is invisible» [3]: an invisible string of digital code that turns into an image only when \"performed\" by a machine. The digital image is just a copy (a documentation) of an invisible original. In the process of visualization, «the digital original […] is moved by its visualization from the space of invisibility [...] to the space of visibility [...]. Accordingly, we have here a truly massive loss of aura – because nothing has more aura than the Invisible.» [4]"
	},
	{
		"pid" : 7,
		"p" : "For Groys, visualizing a digital file is a sacrilege. In the computer environment, this loss of aura is permanent, and can be \"cured\" only by curating: bringing it to the exhibition space, adopting the sacerdotal role of visualizing the Invisible. In other words, the digital image is only apparently ubiquitous and infinitely reproducible in any place: in order to «guarantee its own identity in time» [5], the digital image has to be located in a specific place (the exhibition space)."
	},

		"pid" : 8,
		"p" : "The Topological Aura<br />Groys is here relying on Walter Benjamin's «topological definition of aura», as he calls it in another essay, discussing how the medium of installation can turn art documentation into art again [6]. According to Benjamin, «even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be. […] The presence of the original is the prerequisite to the concept of authenticity.» [7] Benjamin calls this presence (better translated as \"its here and now\") the aura of a given artwork."
	},
	{
		"pid" : 9,
		"p" : "So, mechanical reproduction doesn't destroy the aura: it just depreciate «the quality of its presence», because «by making many reproductions it substitutes a plurality of copies for a unique existence. And in permitting the reproduction to meet the beholder or listener in his own particular situation, it reactivates the object reproduced.» This is a crucial point: aura is not lost – we just lose the ability to perceive it, because we depreciate the here and now. But aura can be restored, thanks to the increasing importance of what Benjamin calls the «exhibition value» of a work of art; or, in Groys' words: «(post)modernity enacts a complex play of removing from sites and placing in (new) sites, of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, of removing aura and restoring aura.» [8]"
	},
	{
		"pid" : 10,
		"p" : "Now, let's go back to the digital file again. According to Groys, the aura of a digital file is the consequence of its own invisibility; any visualization of the invisible original sacrifice its aura to the needs of documentation; and the only way to restore it is to locate the piece in an exhibition. Thus, a digital image is translated into a print, a digital animation into a video installation, a 3D model into a sculpture, etc. Let's take, for example, Thomas Ruff's recent series Zycles (2009). The project includes a series of large-format inkjet prints on canvas displaying abstract images generated by a computer program. The \"invisible original\" is an algorithm (probably not written by the artist) visualized on a computer by a specific 3D program. The artist takes hi-res screenshots of the computer-generated image and translates them into editioned, high quality digital prints: the photo documentation of a performance (the computer performing the program written by a programmer), turned into \"original art pieces\" by virtue of the way they are produced and displayed (localized in an art space)."

		"p" : "The Unbearable Aura of a Website<br />Of course, this process is totally legitimate, and, in a way, it's embedded in our (post)modernity. Yet, we shouldn't forget that these prints are surrogates. And we should also wonder: is it possible to preserve the initial aura of the digital file or to restore it in a digital environment? Is it possible to create an auratic, digital original? At this point, we may be able to translate this question into another: is there a \"here and now\" for a digital artifact? Can it be located, and where?"

		"p" : "Any file has, of course, a specific location on a computer, described by the file path: Apple/Videos/Cremaster.mov. But this is a private location, that can't be perceived as an \"exhibition space\". It's just a file on a computer. Now, open a web address. The same artifact appears in front of your eyes. It's not a file on a computer: it's an object you meet during a trip, in a specific place called, let's say, Youtube, situated in a bigger place called World Wide Web. You can see all this in the location bar of your browser, where the URL of the site is displayed."

		"p" : "Now, please read Benjamin's definition of the aura of a natural object. He writes: «We define the aura of the latter as the unique phenomenon of a distance, however close it may be. If, while resting on a summer afternoon, you follow with your eyes a mountain range on the horizon or a branch which casts its shadow over you, you experience the aura of those mountains, of that branch.» [9] Can you find somewhere a better description of Web surfing? Can you find another place that can be, at the same time, so close to the visitor and so far away from her? When you visit a website, it's simultaneously on your computer and on a server somewhere else in the world. If you are lucky, a bunch of other people are visiting it at the same time: an old German lady, sitting on her sofa; a Japanese secretary in her office; a Swedish teenager in his bedroom. This is the \"here and now\" of a website: download it onto your desktop, and you'll lose it."

		"p" : "In other words, a Web address gives to any file a presence, an aura. A website – or any file experienced through the Internet – is an auratic, digital original. Technically, a website is a collection of files located on a shared computer space, associated to an IP (Internet Protocol) address (a numerical label assigned to any device participating in a computer network) and to an URL (Uniform Resource Locator). If a website is a building, the IP is its position on the map (i.e. 1071 Fifth Avenue New York, NY 10128-0173) and the URL is the name currently used to identify it (i.e. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum)."

You can go to that place using a browser and clicking on a link. As any real original, if the link is wrong, or the website is not there anymore, you can't experience it. You may experience an identical copy locally, but it won't be the same thing: you will miss the aura of the original piece [10]."

One of the first sites cloned by 0100101110101101.org in 1999 was Art.Teleportacia, described by its author, the Russian artist Olia Lialina, as \"the first online art gallery\". Opening a Web gallery, Lialina was not contributing to the commodification of the Web, but she was making a statement, at the time provocative, about the unique aura of a website. In a later text, she defines the URL as «the only parameter which protects copyright» [11] of an online work, and makes a series of examples where the location bar becomes an integral part of the work. One of her works is particularly useful to show it."

The central part of the story is a \"trip through the Internet\", told using the location bar content in a literary way. Agatha and the Sys move from server to server, from country to country, only by means of a click. The work is full of Internet jargon and displays the formalism typical to early net.art, but it's still one of the best and more enjoyable online works ever made, also thanks to a recent restoration."

In 2000, Manetas launched the Neen movement, a label that gathered a wide number of artists [12]. Most of them were working online. As Manetas wrote in a prophetic essay: «Websites are today’s most radical and important art objects. Because the Internet is not just another \"media\", as the Old Media insists, but mostly a \"space\", similar to the American Continent immediately after it was discovered – anything that can be found on the Web has a physical presence."

Thus, francescobonami.com is a website displaying a theoretical text about Neen; jacksonpollock.org is an interactive Flash animation allowing you to paint a Jackson Pollock; jesusswimming.com is a silly animation displaying exactly what the URL says; so does jesusdrowning.com, an homage to Manetas by Rafael Rozendaal, one of the best and more prolific authors of Neen websites. Neenstars (as Neen artists call themselves) create \"places\" for the Internet, where one can stop for a few seconds, take a rest from the information overload, be surprised, and go ahead."

Most of Paul Chan's publications, animations, fonts and sound works can be downloaded for free from nationalphilistine.com, his place on the Internet. Trecartin doesn't even have a website, but he got well known through Youtube before starting building a reputation in the contemporary art world. One might wonder which version of I-be Area has more aura: the online, low-res version, visited by up to 50.000 people, or the hi-res, editioned gallery version of the video."

		"p" : "Another legitimate question might be: why websites didn't become the ultimate collectible? Why collectors still prefer to buy offline, editioned versions of a digital piece instead of websites? Both these choices require faith: you need faith in the workings of the art world in order to believe that the editioned DVD you bought for 10.000 euros is more valuable than the online version of the same video. This is a kind of faith a collector can deal with. But what happens when you buy a website? You have, at a first level, to get used to a different concept of owning."

Furthermore, you need faith because you are buying an invisible original: a bunch of data stored on a server and accessible from a specific online location. In other words, you need the faith required to recognize art out of the context that, along the last century, acquired the ability to turn everything that is shown there into art: the exhibition space."

A copy uploaded on another website can, in turn, acquire a new aura by virtue of its relocation. When Slovenian artist Vuk Cosic put a copy of the Documenta X site on his website, declaring it an Internet readymade, he added the aura of art to an object that up to then only had the aura of the \"natural object\", in Benjamin's terms. We could develop this even further, and say that the Internet is probably the only place where aura is not connected with authenticity. A work by Vuk Cosic has the aura of the original artwork and of the located object; a copy of the same work by 0100101110101101.org has, again, the aura of the located object and of a work of appropriation art. <br />11.
