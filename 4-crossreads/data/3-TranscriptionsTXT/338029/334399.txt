 Sunday 24th, Xmas Eve I was busy all day arranging for to-morrow's Dinner, I am priding myself on my catering abilities.  Managed to get hold of three live ducks so we intend doing it well  &amp;  I spent  &pound;15 on the mess.  The troopers had a baksheesh barrel of beer and they sung all night.

I even obtained a table cloth and the table looked lovely.

The dinner was perfect, one that I will never forget
