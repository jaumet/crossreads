<p>Friday 3 Nov. 1916<br/>Up at 4 &amp; went up to the line with the Brigadier, the morning being fine. There was some rain about midday &amp; then a clear beautiful afternoon very fully taken advantage of by our own &amp; the enemy aeroplanes. They somewhat resembled a swarm of mosquitoes : the enemy planes were very bold &amp; seemed rather to do as they pleased.</p>
