I have many duties to perform now as Brigade Major & o/c 1st L.H.R. the Col being acting Brigadier so far as pay is concerned I get no more but I do not mind. Last night I rode over & saw Ralph Arnold he is a big strong fellow of 26 & is the same Brigade & Camp - I was glad to hear news of May. Very hot midday now.
