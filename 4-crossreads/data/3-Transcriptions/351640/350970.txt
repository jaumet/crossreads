<p>Bobbin Head reminds me of old times.  Wish that I had been with you.  Some day perhaps, and if not, why to you many more happy visits there.  Drink deep of the perfume of the gum trees and the wattle, and look upon the blue coloured waters of Cowan creek.  Bobbin head is to me as picturesque a spot as fortune has taken me to.  I would not say that Maria was, or is, a coward, but that she has always been full of fun.  How time does roll by.</p>
<p>Joseph dear:   Mine is not a lovely hospital, but it is a very difficult one to manage, the patients number 550 to night, a more troublesome lot than ordinarily, but tonight I spoke to them seriously and threatened to stop their luxuries in the form of tobacco and fruit unless they turned over a new leaf, since they like these things, especially tobacco, more than anything else in the world, they will do much to have it kept coming, they are now perfectly settled down.</p>

In a letter Jerome received it was stated that two members of the Legislative Assembly had volunteered, viz.  Chaffey and Fern.  I suppose that the information is correct.</p>
<p>The Ypres post cards came from Sister Blanch Sutton, a Sydney hospital girl who has been working since the beginning of the war at the Belgian hospital in La Panne.   She went to London carrying with her a letter to little Hyman, he got her a position and she has been in it ever since.  She has been in full view of all the fighting by land and sea, and has for working companions the king and queen of Belgium.   The hospital is probably the best fitted in the war area and is well managed.  She writes to me letters that I send to you.  Her last was an enclosure with yours yesterday.
