<p>Dear Mum, Just a card this time as I feel too tired to write a long letter &amp; it is very late, I have been getting along famously with my work &amp; so has Ellis &amp; we have very responsible jobs. I will tell you all news in a letter by another mail. This is a Photo &amp; is typical of the villages we have passed on the way from Suez. We are all well &amp; we were very glad to receive letters in answer to the ones we sent from Freemantle.  Love Harry.</p>
