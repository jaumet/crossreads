In other words if troops are lined up facing north, the enemy can fire on them from the east or the west.Pinnace - this is a light boat carried by merchant and war vessels to serve as a tender.  It would ferry passengers and was also used to communicate between vessels, convey provisions etc.Quid - a quid is 1.Street's Post, Courtney's Post, Steele's Post etc. - all locations on Gallipoli about 1250 yards inland and east of Anzac Cove.Walkers Ridge is about 500 yards N of Steele's Post.
