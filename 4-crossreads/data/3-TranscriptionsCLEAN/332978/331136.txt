 The adjt of this camp can speak English very fluently & in the course of conversation with Commr Lewis he said that he was the first German officer to land on Suvla Bay after our evacuation. He said that our evacuation of the peninsula is the finest thing ever we attempted - The Germans & Turks did not know anything about it. He also said it was just as well we evacuated when we did, as the Germans were preparing to bring up their big guns.
