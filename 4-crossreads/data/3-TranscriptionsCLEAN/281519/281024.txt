The takings were soon over 100, our prices cost price. Profit arises from our 5% cash discount. Some mess stuff also to hand and one tongues a bendictine or curacao after dinner. Colonel Smith and his staff came in before lunch. Forbes rang up regarding officers so I put in two recommendations for first commissions to make us up to establishment. We fight with only about 15 officers, all the rest are away at schools &c At Orderly Room tonight I dealt with a case of malingering - the man has been constantly on sick parade trying to dodge work and I had him examined by two doctors found fit and then handed him 7 days No. 2 by way of reward. Pedler's promotion held up temporarily, will see Smith about this on the morrow and get him to hurry it on if possible. Heavy stunt started 5 p.m.
