Church Service at 9.30 in Y.M.C.A. First time I have had the opportunity to go to church for months. Paid a visit to the cemetery here, where a great number of our boys have been laid to rest; Afterwards walked through La Gourge, on to Lestrem took another road to Merville returning by the Canal road to Estaires. Leave list drawn, my luck out drew 217th place. Received letters from home acknowledging receipt of cable sent from Fort Rompu after the stunt.
