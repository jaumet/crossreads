 issu of coal is 6 lbs per man twice a week , 4 of which goe to the cook hous toward the prepar of his warm food . This is just about suffici to keep the stove go from 4 in the afternoon till midnight ? a real comfort . The sleep is better than the Australian camp too . Three board , about the width of a bed put togeth , rest on two tressl . A tick ? straw mattress ? and four blanket per man . You need it all tho ? and it must be bare suffici in the coldest weather . Littl work was done for the first 3 day . On the second day a batch of 1500 wound , but convalesc Anzac , came into the camp . They were 3 month light duti men , all from Posier and other part of the Somm . We gave them a great recept as they enter . Everyon swarm round them to inquir after friend . It was veri heart stir to see some of our old boy , who were return to Australia from Gallipoli , greet their old pal who again did their bit in Franc met their fate . A real good fellowship exist between these old campaign which will last for life . Its great to see . There quit a few of the old "light blue over dark blue" , the 13th Battalion , and I proceed to ward them concern Alan . I had on my arriv written to him , think that he may have been wound dure the time I was cross the brini , and I determin to find him if in hospit in England . Two boy told me they thought he was kill in Franc , but a third said they were think of a Cpl . Fryer , whose number was peculiar 1340 , the same as Alan 's and who left the 13th Btn , to join the 45 Btn , when the troop were in Egypt . You can bet how I wait for the repli from headquart . I cannot rememb be more figeti and out of sort in my life . I simpli could n't go near the boy again for fear that they would tell me they knew for certain that the poor chap was dead . These boy do n't wast word they have seen too much and suffer the loss of too mani good
