<p>anointed our bodies and saturated our clothing with the latest inventions for their destruction, the stronger and more vicious and ravenous did they become. We nearly went mad through the tactics of these little beasts.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The continuous roar of the guns and shrieking of shells, and constant bursting of the shells from &quot;the other fellow&quot; made sleep for the first night or two, absolutely impossible.</p>
