<p>Moascar<br/>10/3/16<br/>Feeling very unwell after my inoculation. At 0830 took the Company down to Lake Timsah for a swim. Over a pontoon bridge through irrigated plots along the sandy. High sand bank leaving a narrow beach. The lake a fine wide one with salt blue water. A monitor and other war vessels lying at anchor. The North edge of the lake fringed with palms and other tropical vegetation above which rises in the distance the minaret of the Ismailia mosque. The water deepens very quickly and a few paces out takes one well out of depth.</p>
<p>After a pleasant swim all hands basks on the beach for an hour lousing themselves. A launch running round the lake on patrol duty. A captive balloon and several aeroplanes up. The other day an aeroplane alighted near two of the men out in the desert and brought them in as passengers &amp; so saved marching. A picturesque crowd kept passing on the narrow beach of the lake, camels with the loads donkeys almost hidden by loads of green stuff and robed people coming and going. Boys selling "eggsacook" &amp; "orankis big one".</p>
<p>Returned via DHQ to lunch &amp; afterwards all the men were inoculated against parathyphoid and had the rest of the day off duty. Interviewed the Brigadier with regard to transfer to the 53rd but being up against the government all the way, do not expect to go. Received a wire from Colonel Norris offering me the appointment of second in command to him. What a pity it did come a week ago! As it is I shall almost certainly have to remain on here in an inferior job without promotion. Brigadier is to see the General tonight. My batman Spendlove after being absent all day turned up hopelessly drunk at night and fell asleep on my blankets while trying to make bed. Kicked him out &amp; will sack him in morning.</p>
