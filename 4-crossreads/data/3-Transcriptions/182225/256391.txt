<p>SEPT. &nbsp; FRIDAY 29 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Cold &amp; raining most of the day. All the signalling class was in the huts all day doing buzzer work. Poss &amp; I went into Amesbury in evening to have dinner with Colonel Abbott &amp; Miss Ross but we could not get a car to come back so we went to the pictures on top of Larkhill &amp; they were not much good.</p>
