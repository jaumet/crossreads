  
 January 1916 march to Helouan across the desert & several parades in full marching order, so that we can pack up & get ready to march out quickly  I went to the races on the 22nd & spent a good afternoon winning a few shillings after paying expenses.   I met Henry Newing there & arranged to meet him on Monday.  On Sunday I remained in camp & wrote some letters.  I have received letters from Frank, Violet Blair & from Aunt Carrie & replied to all.  On Monday I went into town & got my pay book fixed up, making a new allotment of 5/1 drawing the remaining 3/5 here. 
 I called on Newing at Ordnance & had dinner with him & he gave me a good new military riding overcoat.  I also called at the Vacuum Oil Co & had a yarn with some of the heads.  They said they were pleased to see me & asked me to call again.  There has been a fair bit of rain lately & more has fallen this year than for years previously.  I had tea at York House
