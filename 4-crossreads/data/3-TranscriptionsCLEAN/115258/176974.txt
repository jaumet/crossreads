  
 We are still in the same old camp in the wadi near the spring and there is still absolutely nothing doing. I cant talk about the sprign this time so I'll just have to make this letter a gossip. I feel in a good letter writing humour to night Mother, so I may be a bit like the spring, in this letter; sort of go on for ever. There has been no mail in since I last wrote but I have posted you, as well as that mosaic picture, a tin of seeds and a Kai-ora Coo-ee news to Fred. The seeds are Lotus Beans I think, they grow on a tree and are good feed for stock, especially camels, but are some times issued for our horses and the pods are not bad to taste yourself. I picked these pods off a fairly big bushy tree  &  which was covered with them and the tree was growing on its own amongst some ruins of an old castle, on the very top of one of the hills near Enab on the Jaffa - Jerusalem road
