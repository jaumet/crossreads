<p><u>15th February, 1917</u>:&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking across these peaceful snowfields one</p>
<p>finds it hard to realise that but a few months ago they were the</p>
<p>scene of some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting the war has</p>
<p>seen.&nbsp; Here were villages, factories, woods, cemeteries, roads</p>
<p>and railways;&nbsp; now all has been levelled and what traces there</p>
<p>still are of former days have been covered by a couple of feet of</p>
<p>glistening snow.&nbsp; The wet weather has caused most of the old</p>
<p>trenches to fall in, and even where a particularly well made trench</p>
<p>has withstood the weather it is now full of frozen water and being</p>
<p>snowed over is unrecognisable as a trench.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one gets closer to the present firing line, however,</p>
<p>this peacefulness gradually merges into activity of a military</p>
<p>nature.&nbsp; The French population had not been allowed back so that</p>
<p>no attempt has been made to rebuild villages but in their place</p>
<p>are camps, workshops, dumps, railways and the thousand and one</p>
<p>things required behind an army in the field.&nbsp; Streams of vehicles</p>
<p>of all classes occupy the numerous strategic roads day and night</p>
<p>carrying amuntiion and supplies to the armies in the line.&nbsp; Baths</p>
<p>have been erected where men fresh from the trenches can have a</p>
<p>bath and obtain clean underclothes for their old ones.&nbsp; Soup</p>
<p>kitchens are dotted along the roads to the front line where tired</p>
<p>troops returning from the trenches may obtain a mug of soup anytime</p>
<p>during the day or night free of charge.&nbsp; Everywhere is activity</p>
<p>and everywhere are soldiers all bent on making this the last year of war.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A visit to the Australians old Battlefields at</p>
<p>Pozieres was of interest even though not many of the old spots</p>
<p>were recognisable.&nbsp; Occasionally a familiar object would be found</p>
