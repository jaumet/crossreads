Wilkinson I came out of the line at 1.30 last night to take over billets at "Rose Wood" what a trip we had down pitch dark raining I'll bet we trod fell in every shell hole between the line Rose Wood, to finish up we both fell in to a muddy trench that had been "camouflaged" talk about drowned rats well you should have seen us, to finish up I had to go back as far as the "Ravine" tell the Coy to go round the tram track for they would get bogged taking the short cut as we did
Len was nominated today for the 1st Training Battalion in Blighty hope he gets over I'll feel more relieved, one of us at a time is quite enough at this mad game, especially now Stans gone Everbody is under the impression that we are going to Egypt shortly, wouldn't that be great, a chap could write home say "Mother I'll be home" for he would be dead stiff to get knocked out there it seems quite feasible for look at the transport alone it would save we
