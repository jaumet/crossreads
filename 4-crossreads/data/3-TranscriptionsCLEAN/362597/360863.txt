  
 not allowed to lay a hand on a Corporal & it is a crime to put a Corporal in the cell. 
 I had to go before the 2nd in command & things were pretty soon fixed up. The 2nd in command almost asked me to let the matter drop because the guard - he was a sergeant - & if I had pressed the case would have lost his 3 strips. Anyway he got a blowing up from the adjutant. It was quite an experience & caused a great amount of fun. 
 Wednesday 12.1.16 (21) A hell of a hustle today. At 9.30 the 5 sirens went, which is the signal, stand to the boats.
