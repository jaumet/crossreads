 Monday April 8.1918. 1344. A wet miserable day, and it was a misery cooking at an open fire in the rain. After tea the lads collected some saplings &amp; a [Indecipherable] bags &amp; hessians and put up a cook house against the side of the quarrie. The fire is still in the open, but we have a dry place to do the cooking &amp; to keep the food. 
 Tuesday April 9. 1918. 1345 Misty but fine today, but started to rain again tonight. There was a constant bombardment of the enemy by our artillery this morning. 
 Today all the Transports were marched into Heilly, and examined by the doctor. Several were picked out for further examination on account of lungs &amp;heart. 
 This morning at Merricourt Hughie Gannon was gassed and Bil Gray wounded while camped there last night. They are both cooker drivers and were there with the cookers. 
 The enemy shelled Heilly &amp; other villages early this morning. [One line of shorthand &ndash; I wrote to my wife to night letter 122]
