  
 read these things in French that are read all over France when the British Forces appear to be doing so little. (75) Tuesday 9th May Yesterday was a red-letter day for us. A  march  route march of the British Colonial Troops in Marseille was held in the afternoon when several thousand men took part. Never have I seen such an enthusiastic demonstration - the streets, shops, balconies & windows were packed with people shouting & clapping (a few crying) waving flags as well as throwing flowers & distributing cakes, postcards (& kisses) to the Officers & Men. The only Australians that took part were 200 from the Base Details, Moussot  and  4 Officers & 100 N.C.Os & men from No. 2 G.H. We moved off from Moussot together with 100 New Zealanders at 1.15 pm on our 5 mile march into the city to Place Castellane (the place of assembly for the route march)
