Sat. Apr. 28. Dodson, Bayliss & Nash went away on Leave this morning, which makes me 8th on the List now. After Dinner we found that no wagon was obtainable to take us to Mametz; so rang up Major Bond who promised to send along some vehicles. About 3 p.m. Normy Adams, Jack Edgar & Stan Wilson left, with our "Props" in a Tip dray. At 6 p.m. the remainder of the "N.B.s" left some in a Limber & the others in a Maltese Cart, both from the 59th Batt. 
The Y.M.C.A. Hut was crowded & our Show went off tip-top. Maj. Bond greeted us on our arrival. Maj. Clayton & Capt. Riley were also there. After the Show, Mr King of the Y.M.C.A. & the Padre gave us a slap up Feed, Fried Sausages Bread & Butter, Cakes & Cocoa. After that Maj. Bond took us up to the officers’ Mess & produced some Fire Water. The officers of the 59th are a jolly decent crowd & they gave us a good time. Plenty of Whisky & actually Schweppes Soda. I’m glad to say that our Crowd played the Game & arrived back Home at midnight quite alright.

Sun. Apr. 29th Glorious, sunshining day. Our crowd are football mad. They have played 2 or 3 games a day lately but have lost every one. Maggs, Wally Saunders, & a no. of others are suffering from Injuries & today our W.O. Roberts was admitted to Hospital with a sprained ankle.
