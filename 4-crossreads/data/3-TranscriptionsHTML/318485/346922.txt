<p>A word or two about the camel may <strike>be useful may</strike> possibly be of use to some of you who by way of expiation or other motive find themselves in the desert with a camel <strike>for</strike> the only means of transport.  (to the reader but don't say read)</p>
<p>He is beautiful to draw &amp; paint but he is an animal I cannot love.  Never attempt to caress a camel.  If he should try to caress you &amp; he will if you are not watchful hit him with anything that is handy &amp; heavy, the butt of the rifle, an army boot hobnailed or the Colonel's best <strike>folding</strike> armchair.  Hit him on the Jaw &amp; hit hard.  When mounting screw his neck right round <strike>until you</strike> as if you were trying to dislocate it &amp; snub him short so that he can't bite, his bite is <strike>fateful</strike> fatal.  When on him much may be forgiven for with little urging he keeps up his not unpleasant shamble <strike>for</strike> with regularity &amp; persistency.  On dismounting revert to the original antagonistic attitude.  <strike>The only bond between man &amp; camel is mutual hate.</strike>  The common bond of man &amp; camel is undying hate.</p>
