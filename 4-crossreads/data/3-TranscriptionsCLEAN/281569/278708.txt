 In touch at VMM VGBA 
 Left early this morning & again missed the bivouac & had to get traffic through 21A one of the outposts, moved off at 0300 & passed through Katia at 0530, all clear but it wasn't long before we were in touch all along the line & we eventually drove there line back at VMM VGBA one patrol under a Sgt got right into Oghratina & were looking down the Hod before Jacks spotted them & it took them all their time to get clear, other patrols did well also, we shelled them to some time again firing about 50 rounds at different targets & works completely demolishing same. Left at 2108 for home arriving two hours later tired but happy after putting in an enjoyable day.

 2nd Bde out this morning & officers patrol reported considerable activity along the whole of the enemys line & at dawn they commenced their advance on VMM-VGBM which they held at 0600. Their left had in the meantime swung round Sagia & enveloped Hill 245 which they held all day, at 1400 the Wellington Mtd rifles made a demonstration against them at VMM-VGBA & succeeded in driving them back for 1000 yds captured 16 prisoners & on the whole did real well our casualties were 3 killed 3 wounded. 
 Jacks has made his former line of defence very strong & will take some routing out probably his idea is to fall back on these positions should he get a push from there and Hostile planes engaged ours on two occasions, no losses.
