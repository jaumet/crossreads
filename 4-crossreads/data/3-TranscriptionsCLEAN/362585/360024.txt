pleasure at seeing us.
As money was no object to us, we procured a taxi & told the drive to go where he liked provided he could show us something worth seeing.  First we went through the city itself, & then out onto a beautiful new concrete road that wound round the side of a mountain overlooking the town.  It was a beautiful drive, & every now & then we would run into an avenue of firs so thickly planted as to be like a forest one either side of the road.  The trees are no more than five or six feet apart anywhere, & instead of there being merely being a single row like in our avenues at home, they stretch back for about a hundred yards.  We returned to the transport in time for dinner & the whole afternoon only cost us five & sixpence each.
I am enclosing some leaves which I believe are very pretty if you keep them long enough.
Remember me to everyone & to uncle & auntie & Ethel if she is still in Sydney.
Your affectionate sonKeith.
