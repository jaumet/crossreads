<p>Wednesday 19 February 1919<br/>Rushed around in the morning. Met Marie after lunch &amp; we went to Westminster Abbey &amp; Cathedral. Gee it is great. Beats the frog churches easily. Went out to Janet's hospital for dinner &amp; had a gay old time. Janet &amp; I broke a glass as I was drinking. It cut her finger &amp; my lip. Not very serious tho. as usual it rained all day.</p>
<p>Thursday 20 February 1919<br/>Rained again. Great hobby of London this rain. Went out to Brixton in the afternoon. then rushed out to Dad's place &amp; had dinner &amp; then he took his Aunt, her Cousin &amp;  Kris to see Chu Chin Chow. Enjoyed it immensely. Was excellent &amp; could go again.</p>
