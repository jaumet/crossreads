that Australian troops have been landed in France.

Some chaps will alway get their own back if they think that they have been cheated in any way. After we left this High Class Restaurant one of our number showed me a nice fork which he had picked up of the table in order as he said to get a bit of his own back for the high price he had paid.

Left station at Marseilles at eleven thirty at night. It was raining heavily. After a bit of hustling we got settled in carriages, eight to a carriage, and in this position we were to remain on our way right to the "North of France".

It was not very comfortable this position, either for sleeping or sitting to long. However, nature asserted herself and we gradually went to sleep.

April 6th. Thurs.
When I awoke this morning it was about five o’clock.

At that time we were passing through beautiful fruit growing country. This being springtime the Fruit trees were clustered with beautiful pink blossom. The previous nights rain had freshened everything up, making the grass of the fields lovely and green. Situated amongst these fields and fruit trees, the pretty little Red tiled cottages of the inhabitants made a very peaceful picture.

All day long we passed through country such as I have described. This being a slow passenger train we stop at every station. This gives us a good view of the country. But for the difference in language
