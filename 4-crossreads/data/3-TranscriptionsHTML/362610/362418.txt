<p>Friday 21 July 1916<br/>In the same spot under much the same conditions. Had one or two narrow escapes, one piece of shrapnel puncturing my great coat, while on another occasion a pellet hit my ankle a glancing blow without doing any harm. Great aeroplane activity, it being not unusual to have 15 or 20 planes up, &amp; 20 or more sausage balloons. We saw one German plane brought down &amp; fall end over end into our lines far to our right. Several casualties in the company from shell fire, but fortunately only a few.</p>
