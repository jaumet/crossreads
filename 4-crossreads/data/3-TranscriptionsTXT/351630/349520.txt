 P.S. our flag is a green &amp; white one like this [sketch of flag] Dear Auntie I am sailing on Saturday morning early from no 1 Wooloomooloo wharf per the "Orsova"  &amp; will be parading through the city to the Domain on Friday afternoon.  We will be passing down College st &amp; past St Mary's cathedral so will look out for someone or other from Homebush. I am sorry I could not get out to see you again, I arranged for last monday night but had to do some dirty work.  Last Tuesday night we went to the Criterion theatre &amp; wednesday night I was moved to the showground to get ready for sailing.  I am afraid I will have to bid you good bye again on paper as I dont think I will be able to get out to see you personally.  Farewell with best wishes from your affect Nephew Walter
