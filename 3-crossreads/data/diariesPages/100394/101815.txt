Anzac Day – We were presented with colours today on parade by the O.C. of the Battery Lt. Prior. Plain blue for those who were on the Peninsula and red and blue for those at the landing. I am mess orderly of all things. I felt quite proud to be one of a dozen out of the whole Battery. They are practically all "deep thinkers" as we call them. I went to a splendid concert tonight given by the 8th Brigade.

Today has been almost unbearable, and consequently nothing much of interest has occurred. As a matter of fact it is too hot for one to do anything. I don’t know how the troops are going to stand the severe training they are having at present if this weather continues.

Today we went to an awful lot of trouble and put in some hard work to be ready to be inspected by General Godley in charge of 2nd A. A. Corps. He was in charge of the N Zealanders on Gallipoli. We had to stand out in a baking sun for about an hour and a half and then he gave us about 3 minutes of his valuable time. However we might get to France quicker if he sends in a good report. Got two letters today from France, one each from Moll & Liz. Also box of chocolates from unknown address.

Today we are having another inspection by a Major General Long-Smyth or it may be just plain Smith. I hope it is any rate as he will be more likely to put in a good word for us.

[The following is a note added at the bottom of the diary entries for the 26 and 28 April]
A drunken soldier was travelling in the train from Cairo the other day and opposite him sat an Army Chaplain. The soldier wished to start an argument so he said "I don’t there is a Heaven" The parson reading the "Egyptian mail" took no notice so the soldier repeated his remark. Still no notice. The soldier snatches paper away from Parson and repeats his question "Well" says the Parson "go to Hell and be quick."
