 Dear Bett.   No chance of going to sleep just yet so I am going to start a letter to you.   The day has been fair, cloudy, but no rain, this afternoon two of us went out for a walk and saw a little of the country round.   it is pretty, but does not come up to some parts.   near here are some very large pottery works, and when the furnaces are going full force, there is very little to see round except clouds of smoke.   This morning I saw them and was struck by the volumes of black smoke rising from one quarter so made inquiries and found that the potteries were just putting a little fresh fuel on the fires, not a very pretty scene    I have a P.C. that I will send along,   A Whiff from Hanley, it is quite close    Another batch of wounded coming in tonight, so I should not be surprised if we do not get to sleep till late, but that will not be anything new, for me as I generally manage to keep awake, till 4 P.M.
