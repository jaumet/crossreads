<p>On Tuesday I rose early &amp; caught the train for Oxford (at Paddington Station at 7.30 a.m.  The trip in the train was enjoyable, the country we travelled through was looking at its best. I am certainly very lucky striking such good weather, it was all that could be desired.  Arrived at Oxford at 11 a.m. strolled around the town, &amp; made a few purchases, (including presents for my little nephews &amp; nieces, whom I visited a little later on, during the day.)  I called at Wadham College, to see three pals of mine, from the Ambulance, Sgt. Price, Pte Wiggins &amp; Tovey, who are training there for a commission.  I found the three of them looking tip top, the drilling etc, has certainly done them a lot of good.  Of course they were surprised to see me. You will notice in my Diary that during the end of May, Price &amp; Wiggings left the Unit for the Officers school.  I watched the cadets drilling for a while - a wonderful display, just like clock work.  In the train again at 4.30 p.m. and arrive at Fairford at 5.30, &amp; drove to Aunt Kates home in a buggy. The country in Fairford was looking splendid, I could not help noticing the wonderful harvest.   Found all at Hatherop looking cheery &amp; bright, and as before I felt quite at home there. Aunt Kate was very kind to me, &amp; the following morning I had breakfast in bed, &amp; enjoyed a good lie in till 11 oclock. I needed it, travelling about is very tiring.</p>
