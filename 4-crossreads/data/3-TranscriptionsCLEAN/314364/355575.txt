it didn't arrive sooner. We had stew for Break. It wasn't bad, but the very fact of it being stew turned a good many off it. The War Chest Club are making our stay as pleasant as possible by raining Fruit, Biscuits & Smokes & Daily Papers. The Military Rations are mighty scarce & need augmenting. I got a Parcel & Letter from B.E. during the afternoon. A jolly good Parcel & very welcome, but the Letter was the most welcome. B.E. writes the most beautiful letters, & then calmly says she wishes she could write as nice Letters as I do. Why mine are not a patch on hers. Gib & I had a swim & at night we went fishing, but didn't catch anything. It was glorious scrambling down the rocks, & sitting on the Beach watching the Manly Boats go by. I wrote a Letter to B.E. during the Day also to Nell &am; Mother. I wonder what Luck they had in getting a Cottage. I'm anxiously awaiting the arrival of another Letter now.Sat. Mar.29.Another Glorious Day. For Breakfast we had Mutton chops Bread, Jam & coffee. After the Tent Parade "Gil" & I scrambled down the rocks to the Beach, where we spent the morning splashing about in the water & sunning ourselves on the Beach. It was great. The only thing to make it perfect would be to have B.E. here with me. I got another Letter from B.E. this morning, & this afternoon I got a Parcel containing Home made Cake, Tinned Fruit, &  cream & a tin of "Soner" Tobacca. A real sensible Parcel. Didn't the crowd enjoy the cake, my word they soon made a mess of it. We have a good deal of "shop" cake lately but anything "Home-made" appeals to the crowd.  We spent the whole of the afternoon on the Beach, & I feel deliciously tired tonight. The fellows are enjoying being here. To see them on the Beach, romping about on the sand, & playing Leap Frog, etc, one would imagine they were a lot of Kids. Tomorrow I must write to Mother & reply to the Letter she wrote to Lill & me.
