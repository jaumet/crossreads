 1916 July 18 Tuesday 
 An exceptionally furious bombardment began at 7 p.m &amp; continued without interruption till daylight. Something must be doing  This part is considered one of the hottest of the line. Stayed about our billets all day expecting orders to move on. Did not come. Went to see some trenches further in wood. Wonderfully constructed, deep &amp; long. Artillery arrive in wood several batteries. Mud &amp; slush. Short rations  Go down to village and augment our tea with fried eggs &amp; bread.
