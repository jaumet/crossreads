 Thursday 23 August 1917. 
 Turned out at 6.30 am. Breakfast 7 a.m.&nbsp;Not feeling quite up to the mark I never went into the surf this morning. 
 At 3.30 pm. a Taube came over but the anti-aircraft guns fired&nbsp;16 shells at her and she flew back again, apparently unharmed. 
 Wrote 2 letters. One home &amp; one to D&#39;nong 
 Had tea &amp; after a dip turned in.
