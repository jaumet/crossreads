  
 I saw some sheaves of beautiful green lucerne & red clover that was brought into the Stables this morning. It was a treat for the horses, and reminded me of Merrigum, the green fields there. This country is similar to Merrigum, green fields everywhere but unlike Merrigum it is thickly populated & the farms are small. The whole landscape is dotted with farm houses & villages and little shops and estaminets, The "Daily News" reports important gains on two points on the Arras front, first line positions abandoned near Armentieres. An Zeppelin was brought down in flames in the N. Sea by the Navy. An enemy observation balloon was brought down East of here. It came down in flames. It was several miles away and there was only a great cloud of smoke when I saw it. We were paid this afternoon. We were paid short as there was a shortage of funds. I received 10 francs = 7/2, though there is about  1 due to me. We were also issued with tobacco & cigarettes from the comfort funds. I received 2 packets of "Volunteer S bag" & 1 stick of "Half Dark Nailrod" a scotch tobacco. The tobacco on issue before was "Imperial" & "Crown" in flat cakes. I received a short letter from my little niece today, (Maggie Kittson) dated April 9. I heard last night that Charlie Bayley of Shepperton died from wounds in the Hospital
