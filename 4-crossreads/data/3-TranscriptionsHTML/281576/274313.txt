<p>Sat. Dec. 29.  For a stroll until Dinner Time.</p>
<p>Sun. 30.  Spent a quiet morning by the Fire telling yarns.  After dinner we went for a walk to Ern Harvey's.  At night we went to Church, St Michaels.  Ibby &amp; I paid a visit to Mr Clough's where he showed us St. Michaels Roll of Honour, on which Sam's &amp; my name appeared.  Wrote Letter 49</p>
<p>Mon. 31.  Ibby had to return to Felixstowe  this morning, so his wife &amp; I saw him off at the Station.  He only had 3 days Leave.  His wife is staying till Wed. morning, so I am staying on to keep her company.  Mrs Ibbs, Fanny Buckley, Jenny Ibbs &amp; I sat up &amp; saw the old year out.</p>
<p>Tues. JAN. 1. 1918. New Year's Day.  Last night, at about 10 to 12, I went outside, so that when the clock struck 12, I could walk in, &amp; wish 'em a Happy New Year".  Stayed outside about 20 minutes then they came &amp; told me that the Clock did not strike after 7.  Good Joke.<br/>This is Market day in Stone, but very quiet to what it was in the old days.  Stone is very quiet.  Mrs Ibbs &amp; Jenny &amp; I went to a Whist Drive &amp; had a most enjoyable time.  At every table I met someone I knew.  There were some jolly nice Girls there. I never dreamed that Stone had so many Girls.  They all called me Jack till they found out that I was married, then it was "Mr Moore".  B.E. will always do me anyhow.</p>
