<p>we are stirring them up properly &amp; as I <strike>wit</strike> write this our artillery is pouring in the shells from all sizes of gun's.<br/>Yesterday a shell came right through the roof of an estaminet, but wonderful to say no one was hurt.<br/>This morning most of the Coy. went to Bac St.Mair for a hot bath &amp; very nice it was though we had a fair walk.  I saw several Frenchmen working on the road's  with only one arm, I suppose they had lost it somewhere in this war<br/>There are splendid crops all along the road now, oats wheat, peas beans, clover mangels, corn etc. the recent rains have done them the world of good. &amp; the country looks beautiful<br/>On our way back from the baths we dropped in at a little estaminet &amp; had our dinner, chips &amp; eggs are the most</p>
