<p>[28.3.17. S.M Herald]<br/>Lieutenant Fred Phillips.</p>
<p>News has been received that 2nd Lieut. Frederick Stobo Phillips, has been killed in action.  He enlisted shortly after the declaration of war as a private in the A.M.C., and was afterwards transferred to the 1st Battalion, A.I.F.  Prior to his transfer he was awarded the Military Cross, and was given a commission for conspicuous bravery at Pozieres as a stretcher bearer.  At the time of his death he was in charge of a Lewis gun section.  Being in a tight corner he ordered his men to retire with the gun and leave him.  He was last seen bandaging the wounds of a comrade, though badly wounded himself, within 40 yards of the German trenches.  He was the third and only surviving son of the late Major Henry and Mrs. Phillips, and grandson of the late Captain Robert Stobo, of Sydney.  His sisters are Mrs. Edward Owen, All Saints Rectory, Hunter's Hill, and Mrs. W. H. Read, The Wurley, Wahroonga.  He was 34 years of age, and was educated at the Sydney Grammar School and the King's School, Parramatta.  For some years he was in Messrs. Dalgety and Company's (Sydney) office, and left that firm's employment to go on the land in the Casino district.</p>
