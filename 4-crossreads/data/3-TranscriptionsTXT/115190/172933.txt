my neighbours nag wanders on to my stomach & legs in his search for a bit of picking, & ^occasionally my old nag snorts & blows down my neck occasionally & tugs at the shoulder strap.  I cant say that I sleep peacefully & I wasnt am not sorry when I saw see the dawn.
28th Septr  We climb down the steeper rocky side of a ravine and cross a bog at the bottom.  On the other side we halt in a boulder strewn ploughed field for breakfast.  Hitherto we have seen no Taubes, but now as I sit nibbling at the good old B & B I hear a whirr - r - r - r - r - whush & 2 Taubes come sailing up the valley dropping bombs as they come.  One of them strai flys straight for us.  I hear the order "Lie down by your horses" & I lie on my back with my arm thro the reins.  He swoops straight at us & dear oh dear
