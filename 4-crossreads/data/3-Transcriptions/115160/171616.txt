<p>of the sun I will get this summer. I was&nbsp;down at the sea last week on my afternoon of we cycled down &amp; had a dip. the sea was rough&nbsp;&amp; a high wind blowing &amp; to put a finish on it the rain came on in torrents &amp; we had no coats &amp; no shelter there are lots of young officers in training down there &amp; they had all to have a talk with us in all the rain they did not seem to think anything&nbsp;about it for a soldier I suppose he has a lot of that to come through &amp; we did not get enough as we fully intended going down again today only it was so wet &amp; it had to be put off for another week. &nbsp;The Egyptian mail yesterday brought us another letter from John &amp; he is still well &amp; bright he is looking forward to the winter</p>
