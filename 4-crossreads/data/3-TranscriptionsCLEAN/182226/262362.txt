Monday 6 December, 1915
We all went for a bit of a route march in the morning, we went about 3 miles all together & had a pint of beer given to us when we got back & it went well, it is the first I have had since I have been on Gozo.
Cards again after dinner & right on till about 3.30 a.m. I am beginning to get a bit of cash back which is very gratifiying. 
Every one gambles here & it is very funny to see chaps who have never done any of it before catch the fever, after a very few sittings they are just as bad as the rest.
