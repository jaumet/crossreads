  
 Friday 23 March 1917 [22 March 1918] Nothing worthy of note to report.  Life is as regards work, very monotonous but certainly not otherwise.  We are all going out enjoying life. At 6 p.m. S. Reed & I meet Mr. Dowling & J. Andrews & go Pyramids for motor spin & supper, very enjoyable it all was & two dear boys & what matters if we behave as children once more, eat our chicken like infants, have our fortunes told & heads lean on shoulders & arms are round one another in the car driving home?  We are men & women but it is good to play sometimes & they are two dear boys. Mr. Dowling goes up the line tomorrow, 9 a.m. Rockets are seen on our return journey reminding us that there really is a war on after all.
