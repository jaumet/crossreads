works there & there were plenty of Iron rations for Fritz in the making all sizes from whizz bango to the big monsters: women were mostly employed even on the coal heaps: Etaples is a large camp alright: got out a little past Amiens at 2 am & marched off:
Wednesday July 12th marching through Amiens took nearly four hours & it is a fine city: the roads were nicely laid out & had the road in the middle footpath at each side with a row of large trees on each side of the footpath making four rows of trees in all & they would be nice & shady: the trams were funny little things: the river runs right through the town: the outer suburbs were a bit dowdy & the people did not seem too much claso: passed miles of motor transports & there were plenty of hospitals in the town: this is the Somme district: left Amiens behind & passed through a little village: while resting a young woman came out with a jug of cafe & handed it round. I got a cup & it went well: passed through & then along a lovely shady road for a couple of miles: the large trees met overhead & looked well: arrived at Argoeuves about 8 am & billeted: there was a rush for "scran" be we got a loaf & a couple of dixies of milk each so done well: wash & clean up & then laid down: we struck a bit of a wire netting affair & used as a bed & it went well: up for tea & went for a walk: had a look round the village cemetary & it was full of wreaths made out of beads & they did look well: met Barham Bolt & Brown & they look well: our plate of meat have had a rough passage the last few days & we are a bit tender: these farms have plenty of pets, rabbits, pigs,goats, etc: our barn is not too bad & electric light is all through the outhouses: Good luck to King Billy & his white horse: it is two years to day since I went to board at Ethel's place:
