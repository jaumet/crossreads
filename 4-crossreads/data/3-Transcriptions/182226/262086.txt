<p>Saturday 4 March, 1916</p>
<p>Now I must say goodbye to my little diary, the recorder of my pleasures &amp; hardships &amp; the times of peace &amp; war through which it has been my lot to pass since leaving my civilian life for the sterner one of a soldier.</p>
<p>I am sending it on a long journey which I hope to make myself ere long but if perchance I am long in coming this little book will tell in brief what my fortunes have been in these distant lands to which the call of the Flag has led me.</p>
<p>God grant us a speedy victory &amp; a safe return with honour.</p>
<p>L.K. Stuart</p>
