<p>Saturday 6 May 1916<br/>A fairly fine day, one or two light showers falling. Re-reading letters, censoring &amp;c. during the morning &amp; in the afternoon watched a football match, 14/2 V 12/2 resulting in my company being beaten by 6 to 3. In the evening went into Etaples with Prescott &amp; several others to a little dinner. Coming home at 10 o'c we saw lights above the clouds in two places, in all probability Zeppelins. One appeared to be over Boulogne &amp; the other S of Etaples. Later on in the night while lying awake I thought I heard one or two explosions.<br/>A "Methodist" (E.H.) &amp; pair of socks (W.E.C.) had come to hand during my absence.</p>
