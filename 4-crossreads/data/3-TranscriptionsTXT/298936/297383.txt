July 1915
Wednesday 28
Day of embarkation.
Took men down to boat at 8 A.M.
All arrangements in good order.
Splendid system of fixing men up
Huge crowd assembled on wharf & great excitement as the boat slowly moved away.
I sat on forward bridge & watched vain endeavours of friends to hear what each of other said [indecipherable] till afternoon & then left for Melbourne 2 p.m.
