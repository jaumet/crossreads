<p>of my voice arranged to be sent to Hospital.</p>
<p>Sunday 23rd</p>
<p>The Hospital seemed a very decent place plenty to eat but I did not feel like it.  The Dr. had a look at me this morning asked my age, mocked my wispering &amp; Marked me for a Board.  So have just got back to the Y.M. am to report in the morn.  Was under 24 hours in Hosptl.  It is a funny way to do things.</p>
