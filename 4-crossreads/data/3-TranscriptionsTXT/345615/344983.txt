Our chaps have had a heavy time of it - the Roads were very soft & the waggons getting bogged continually - so it was a case of pulling each other out by turns consequently there were G.S. Waggons all over the countryside, in addition to bogged Motor Cars & other vehicles. If the roads had been better so as the armoured cars could have joined in, the engagement would have been more decisive
As it is there we have inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy & driven them away from the wells, but as they can reoccupy them at any rate time & also inflicted serious casualties on us it seems to be a stalemate
The weather is has been miserable today
