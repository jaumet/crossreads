  
 Saturday Jan 30-15 -  Swim at 6.15 am - I am Medical Guard to-day - This means this ship flies a signal & any ship in harbor who wants a doctor sends off for me - I have to remain inboard 7 Bells to 7 Bells - i.e. 7.30 am to 7.30 am & do what comes along - There's a little innovation started which I have not previously mentioned - We found we had a bugler on board & that he got 3d per diem for bugling - He now has to start the revelly at 5.30 & right thro the day till 7 pm you hear the calls going out - Each evolution has its call Divisions - General quarters - Fire - Gunnery - Evening quarters at 7 pm & so on - All hands are piped to dinner & to fold 'ammicks by the same style of pipe as in Nelson's day - a pipe much like a pipe but the stem ends at the top of the bowl - [Sketch].  It takes time & practice to use the pipe efficiently - They are made of Silver & only issued by the Navy - [Sketch] The day was hot & heavy & the Ward room disgusted me by its talk about Sydney - mails & girls - I wanted volunteers to climb Die Mutter 3300 feet & got no encouragement - I cursed them for soft girls & townies.
