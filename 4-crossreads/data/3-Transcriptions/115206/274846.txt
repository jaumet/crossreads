<p>October 1918.<br/>Thursday 3</p>
<p>On right of Bellicourt, Bty Position.<br/>Weather fine and warm<br/>I feel very sad today for one of my very best pals Smithie has left for Australia. Several other fellows in this Battery have all gone to Australia today.<br/>An attack this morning resulted in the capture of Ramicourt with over 3000 prisoners.<br/>Packed up to move out for a spell today, but did not go. We are to go into action for a stunt on 5th tomorrow morning, as this mornings work has left us out of range. Believe we are to go in the line again tomorrow.</p>
