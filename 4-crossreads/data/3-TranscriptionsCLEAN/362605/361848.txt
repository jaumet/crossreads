  
 Aunt Hannah came down on the previous Day but we could not come down on that day as it was so wet.  We had to cycle through a snow-storm to the Station as it was.  I visited Mrs Grundy & Mrs Gibson both Sisters of Captain Collister.  They gave me a very cordial reception.  Gran was pretty stiff about the shoulders with Muscular Rheumatism but I took some dope over to Her to rub with.  I had good weather most of the time & good voyages across.  The Germans are nearly all repatriated back to Germany from the Island now & the Government is to release more steamers by Whitsuntide.  All are well at the island & we had a real nice Homely time together. 
 Well, My Dear Ones, I must go to bed now.  It is just on "lights out" & it is getting very cold.  Dick Toppin comes down for the weekend this week & I am to meet Ellis in Salisbury on Monday or Tuesday next. 
 We cannot send cables re our return but Ellis aught to be Home the latter end of June or beginning of July & I should follow a month or so later. 
 Au Revoir Best Love Harry
