<p>hoped to get in touch with the German Fleet. Everyone was keen to avenge the loss of &quot;Good Hope&quot; &amp; &quot;Monmouth&quot;, which the Germans had sunk with all hands off&nbsp;Valparaiso&nbsp;on November 6th;. I had lost several good friends in these&nbsp;two ships. We felt that now there was some hope of meeting the enemy, as we knew them to be at this side of the Pacific. Up to this time, since the outbreak of hostilities, &quot;Australia&quot; had steamed over 21,000 miles,&nbsp;over an average of 180 miles a day. As we proceeded South the temperature rose, and at night with all ports obscured by deadlights, the ship was almost unbearable between decks. One&#39;s cabin now only contained a bunk, everything else of a wooden nature having been thrown overboard. One day I saw&nbsp;several turtles afloat quite near the&nbsp;ship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Nov. 30. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few days out we heard by wireless&nbsp;from our Consul at Iquique, Chili, that German Cruisers had called there &amp; left on Nov.27th; proceeding north. &nbsp;Hopes ran high &amp; we looked forward to meeting them after filling up with coal at the Galapagos Islands. The &quot;Newcastle&quot; which had been sent to Manzanillo to despatch cables &amp; mails, reported that all telegraph wires had been cut &amp; that the whole country of Mexico was up in arms. The Americans had only the previous day left Mexico&nbsp;City thinking that order had been restored, &amp; therefore withdrawing all troops.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dec. 3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a 6 days journey we arrived off&nbsp;Chatham Island &nbsp;</p>
