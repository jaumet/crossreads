My Dear Pater Mater Dora Stan
I received a letter a few days ago from Dora but none since Albany from you, Pater mater. I spose they are astray usual. 
I wrote last mail again hope you get that. 
Ive just returned from a long march in the desert glad to get a wash shave rest. So are all our horses poor chaps. Viva will swap letters with you. I write every time I get a chance. We are worked from 5.30 am sometimes till 8 or 9 at night lights out at 9.30 pm so we don't get much time. Ill write a bit more before this is posted but for tonight adieu or Au revoir I should say. Best love to you all
From Jack
