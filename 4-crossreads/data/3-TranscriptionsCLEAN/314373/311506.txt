  
 Hiding a portion of it and stretching as far as the eye could see were the hills on the horizon of rich blue colours, whilst separated from them by a band of purple was the endless red desert looking as vast and endless as the ocean we had lately crossed and as pitiless as when seen at midday when the sun makes it a waving mass of heat.  Draped over it is the morning mist and through this veil thousands of camels  from the camp silently wend their way across it, led by their Arab drivers swathed from head to foot in their loose black robes, making it all look like one hugh procession of spirits. However, the thoughts that such a scene as this gives rise to are dispelled only too soon by the order to double, for every one of us has sore feet, and unless spirits can use some rather strong language we could certainly not be described as above.  During the afternoon we just marched to the other side of the railway line and sat there till it was time to come home.

This was according to our guide who was a little French Scout Boy, but the masonry around the pool was certainly not that old, and as he gave us wrong information all through he is most likely wrong. Another point of interest was the Nilometer which is a scale marked in a rock pillar, in order to show how high the Nile rose, at any time, and the Natives used to be taxed by it, for if the river rose higher one year than another they were taxed more heavily. From here we drove to the Coptu Church - Abou Sirgeh,  where the wood carvings inlaid with ivory were exquisite. There were three altars, one
