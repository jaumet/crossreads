 (57) at eight o'clock in the morning and waited until the doors opened at 6 p.m. &ndash; the performance starting at half past eight.  It was a very interesting day and pleasantly spent.  We bought boxes from the Covent Garden Market boys to sit on, and it was an unwritten law that if one went away for lunch &amp;c no one would "jump" their claim.  The street musicians put on records of Melba on their gramaphones and every hour or so the newsboys would sell us the latest editions of the papers.  At 4 p.m. Melba arrived at the stage entrance in her car and made a speech to us.  It was a wonderful and memorable performance. 
 I also heard Madame Clara Butt sing in the great Albert Hall London (which holds 11,000 people) one Sunday afternoon for one shilling. 
 Next day went and saw the Crystal Palace, a huge building built of glass.  A lot of German prisoners were interned here during the war. 
 Then went and saw the British Museum (most of the treasures were removed for safety &ndash; against damage from air bombs), Kensington Museum, The Art Gallery and Bow Street Church with its famous bells associated with the legend of Dick Whittington and his cat.  Also saw the Monument (commemorating the great fire of London) and the only wooden house in London. 
 London is a wonderful city of 7,000,000 people and it would take months to see everything interesting in it.  Also visited Carlyle's house in Chelsea. 
 There are no trams in the city proper &ndash; only 'buses (two storey).  The tubes are wonderful.  One can travel for miles, hundreds of feet underground, even under the river Thames. 
 Next day I saw the Prince of Wales perform the ceremony of the Trooping of the colours in Hyde Park. 
 My leave was now up and next day I returned to Weymouth.
