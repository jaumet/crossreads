<p>18/2/16<br/>Great improvement in early morning turnout. Organized permanent working parties will allowed "B" Co this morning to do bombing and other field work. They were practising the assault from trenches against sand bag dummies and enjoyed it, swinging along at a jog trot and getting good thrusts home. A report from an agent that O.C. Turks Camel Corps has issued orders for an attack on outposts for reconnaissance purposes. Advancing over desert under cover of darkness and attacking at dawn. We are ready.</p>
<p>Rode round outposts and defence works wearing shorts pulls hairs out of legs, riding. New Brigade Commanders today. Also Brigadier returned from D.H.Q and told Smith that Norris was to get command of the new unit and that Pedler's name and mine had been sent on for company commanders, the other two recommendations being turned down and that our names were now in the hands of the Army Corps Commander.</p>
<p>Went round the works again in the afternoon "D" Co. hard at work on the railway and making good progress. Large cutting to be made through sand hill but the ground easy enough to work in all conscience. Some mail arrived for Brigade 14 camel loads. Good fight this afternoon between Rhoden and Lawson. Lawson won doing very good ducking. Word received that G.O.C will inspect us on Sunday next at 1330 so perforce our sports were cancelled. Message received advising 40 Turkish cavalry and some patrols about 3000 yards out. "B" Co. and M.g.s all got into fighting kit ready to move out at a moments notice and take up positions in front and will stay so all night. Great clicking of bolts and bustle down the lines the old heads quietly and affectionately caressing their rifles and praying for dirty work. Do not expect anything will transpire. Bed.</p>
