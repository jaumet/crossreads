  
 convoy of Rifles & ammun passed thro the place two days ago bound for Kutchik Khan.  Rotten luck we didn't meet them. 
 June 18 Arrived at Bijah much to the consternation of the Governor on a/c of us coming in from the north due to us striking the main road north of Bijah.  Camped on the outskirts near a poplar & and vine plantation.  Plenty of food fresh water.  Extremely tired dusty & footsore. 
 This last stage was a nightmare.  Food was terribly scarce & the water nearly drove us mad.  Thanks only to Capt Hooper we were able to get anything as he rode off from the beaten track to mountain villages & and got a little food, otherwise we would have had a very thin time.
