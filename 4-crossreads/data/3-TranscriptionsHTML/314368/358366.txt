<p>Duston War Hospital<br/>Ward 3<br/>Northampton<br/>England<br/>16.5.17</p>
<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>I sent you a fairly long letter last week, with a fair detailed account of my being in Hospital and I trust you have received it safely by this. I am pleased to be able to tell you that I am feeling real fit, the ankle is getting on fine, the cut is healing up well and gives me very little pain. Although it was not dangerous, the size of the cut in the ankle will take a few weeks<br/>to heal up so I shall be here for some time yet.  I am now able to get up and wheel myself about the hospital grounds in a chair so the days don't seem so long as they did while in bed.  We have been having splendid weather here for the last week or so, nice and warm, such a change after the cold winter.  I see by the papers that the weather has been quite warm</p>
