Saturday 24 Aug. 1918
On Wednesday the bearers moved up the line, (Hall & L. O. Walton being left behind, to my pleasure), & on Thursday morning we moved off to a place about 2 kilometres away from Vaire, just outside Hamelet. The latter village is only visible as a battered heap of ruins, little better than razed to the ground. We found a couple three of huts let into the ground about a couple of feet & heaped up all round with earth, in the usual manner as some protection against splinters from bombs. These, with a couple of marquees plus a quartermaster's marquee constituted a main dressing station. One of the former was for sick parades & the other for dead bodies.
Fritz came over bombing that night & let a few drop all round, but none on or very near
