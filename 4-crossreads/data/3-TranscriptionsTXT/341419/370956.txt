there when up steps a gentleman & enquires if it would be possible to get a message to a friend of his on board ship.  I was going back there so of course I offered to take the message.  He thanked me, wrote a message & had bad taste enough to put a shilling on it for me.  It took the wind out of my sails for a bit but I did not like to refuse it & so I sent it back by the sailor who accompanied me.  But ye Gods, I must have developed into a very low down looking individual!  But then, Australians have eyes to see & see not.
Tomorrow we disembark into the train & reach Sydney on Boxing morning.
