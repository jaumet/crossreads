 France 7th May &acute;16 My dearest Sister, To-day being Sunday &amp; things being very quiet, although here one day is the same as another &amp; the only thing that makes the 7th any different from the others is that, if it is at all possible the Padre comes round &amp; addresses the boys on the evils of drink &amp; bad living etc, he is going to pay us a visit this afternoon, that is if the Huns dont shell us. Our C of E pilot is one Ashley Brown whose father taught school at Harwood some time back, we had an interesting chat on the boat coming over, he is a very decent fellow. Our Company are pretty good at Hymn singing, so this moming we issued out some books &amp; marked off the ones we would sing:- "Abide with me""Lead Kindly light" &amp; "Sun of my soul thou Saviour dear" which everyone knows so we should have some good singing when he comes along, it is remarkable the way the boys turn up &amp; enjoy a short service, "not that they are a wowseristic lot by any means", we like to encourage that spirit. I was sorry to read in your last letter that you were sick again. I wish you could get over that complaint of yours &amp; be your old self again.
