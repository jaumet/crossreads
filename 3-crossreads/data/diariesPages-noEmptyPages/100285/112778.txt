I told him that if I could get no satisfaction from him I would go further one word brought on another so we had a good old row, I then went round to the Admission Hall found the Orderly Sgt got him to parade me to the Colonel, he listened to what I had to say said straight away that I was to have my name scratched off the list that I was to get my leave, he then went into the office blew the Sgt up properly for it was his mistake all along only he wouldn't admit it, you see if I had held my tongue had not spoke up for my rights I would have lost my leave, for once you get as far as Sutton Veney you have one leg in France as the saying goes, for you will be there in no time.
