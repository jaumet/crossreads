1918Sun 24th Feb.Our best meal for many months was at 6 p.m.
Beef (yes, Beef!), beetroot, potatoes, and coffee ersatz (that word Ersatz (substitute) was to become well-know to us).
We gorged till we could gorge no more, and then the hungry German sentries came in and devoured the scraps.
Tue. 26th.Yesterday a procession of doctors dug around all over me, consulted my Doc's report, & mumbled "operation".    Today I moved to the hospital proper.
The hospital is the Festungs-lazarelt, Kiel-Wik, & consists of about 10 separate buildings, each complete and detached, yet all connected up by underground tunnels.
I am in Haus B, ward 25.
The wards are small, comfortable, & beautifully lighted - a row of big windows stretching right across one wall.
