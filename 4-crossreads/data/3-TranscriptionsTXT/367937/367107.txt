well and have made a wonderful recovery.Aunt Katie and I are just going into town and Aunt Katie is going to hold my hand at the photographers.I saw Mrs Meares and Sibbie on Mudgee railway station they were at the gates when the train passed and I waved to them so they came up and talked to me.My Eileen was not there though.  After I had my tea I was up at the end of the station talking to Mr Marks and when the whistle blew for the train to start I ran to get in my carriage only to find the rotton door was locked.I grabbed a porter but his key would not fit the lock it was miss my carriage or get in through the window which I did (my word was tight).This is at the P.O.  Hope you all got home safely.   Love to F & kind regards to MassYour loving sonRob
