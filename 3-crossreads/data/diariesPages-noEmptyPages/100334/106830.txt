I returned at 6.30 and formed up in the Queue outside the Cinema Hall and at 7 Pm the doors opened and we all filed in, It did not take long to fill the Hall and at 7.30 when the Orchestra struck up a lively tune the place was packed, it was quiet a treat to see the W.R.A.F Girls all over the Hall. The seats raised at the back were filled with Officers and N.C.O's with a fair number of Girls with two and three stripes on looking around one could hardly notice two or 3 girls together, they all mostly had Boys as companions. Several W.A.A.C.Girls came in and they did not receive a too good of a reception, several lads in the Hall started Hooting and I knew in an instant something was wrong, on making inquiries, I was told that when the W.R.A.F.Girls went promenading down to the village, the W.A.A.C. Girls hooted and hissed them when passing their Camp, evidently jealous of their positions, that easly explained the Hooting in the Hall. The Aeros Concert
