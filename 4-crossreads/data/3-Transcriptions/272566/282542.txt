<p>Saturday 7 April</p>
<p>Mild Day.  Making &amp; fitting a stove for a coal fire in our huts.  An oil drum serves the purpose well, with piping to take the smoke out.  13 of us occupy these huts and are getting quite comfortable.  Stretchers to sleep on.  The dinner passed off very well and so did the concert given by the "Nightbirds" later in the evening.  "The Nightbirds" is the name given to the 8th F. Amb. concert party.  Officers provided the pig for the dinner tonight.  In response to words of thanks expressed by one of our sergeants at the concert, Col. Shepherd said the 8th has put up a record above all other ambulances on the Somme during the past 6 months.  He is surprised at the way some of us have gone through it all.</p>
