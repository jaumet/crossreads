birds in the air.  I have seen as many as 40 up at once & we can only see one little part of the front.  One one day I saw 6 planes brought down, mostly Germans, two German planes were brought down just by us within about a 1/4 of hour came down in flames, they would be sailing along having a good look at the country when all of a sudden one of our planes would come along, make a dive at him & put a burst of machine gun bullets into him, a little smoke would come from Fritz then
