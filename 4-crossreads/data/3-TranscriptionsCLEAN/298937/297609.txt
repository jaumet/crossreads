 After fooling about a great deal all thoughts have been put out of our head of leaving for England, & although I have heard from good authority that in ten days time we shall go to England, the general opinion seems to be that we shall not go at all. They have been picking out groups of men for various jobs in Egypt, such as details to the Light Horse. This will probably go on till we leave, so that if only we are not picked for such jobs, we stand a good chance
