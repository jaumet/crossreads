15/1/16To Saults for tea with Curnow and then took train for Heliopolis riding on step. Met J. and took her for gharry ride to Mattaric giving her a squeeze. Walked to obelisk and meditated for a few moments on its antiquity. The carvings so plain & the obelisk delightfully situated. Took a turn up and down the winding paths between the growing crops.
Returned to Heliopolis hotel and had supper met J. who seemed to me too smart to be good. Arranged to meet J. tomorrow afternoon. Returned by train with Nicholas whose wound is pretty well all quiet in the town and the occasional stink and perfume of the streets gives that so Oriental touch. The trenches have so changed us that we are quite sobered indeed almost wowsers and these things no longer stir our pulses as of yore. The niggers seem to sleep out these cold nights noticed 12 in a row under a verandah huddled up together sitting heads on knees fast asleep.
Shepheards very gay a dance being on. Bare shoulders fine dresses and soft eyes looking into soft eyes. Shepheards is not the place it was five months ago nor is Cairo the same vicious city. Rumoured that no men are allowed in Wazir now and picquet is hell of a size. Tired slept like a top between white sheets, the doctor with a cargo of drinks followed.
