 Friday 8th Nothing doing bar ordinary regimental duties. 
 Saturday 9th Nothing doing bar shelling a taube over during the day but very high up 
 Sunday 10th O.S. for day.  Received a visit from two of the 1st Field chaps &amp; learnt all about the old unit.  They had just returned from the Somme stunt &amp; had had 9 killed &amp; 30 odd wounded.  Casualties to the 1st &amp; 2nd divisions about 15,000 &amp; a goodly number in the 4th and 5th divisions so that there has been some wastage in our crowd lately.  Practically all caused by shell fire, men being continually buried under debris etc. 
 Monday 11th Wrote a few letters during the day &amp; made an attempt on French 
 Tuesday 12th O.S. for day. Usual routine fatigues etc. etc.  Mail coming along in driblets almost every day bringing something.  Weather much improved again.  A good bit of sickness about so much so as to call for a rebuke from D.H.Q.  In orders they gave out, that a large number of sick would be put down to slackness of discipline &amp; the officers would be held responsible. The local water is not fit to drink without being chlorinated although the local inhabitants seen to thrive alright.
