 [Sunday 2 April 1916] 
 Inspected a Camp 13 miles South &ndash; The only trouble appeared to be the number of Scorpions- in the old mud walls around the Camp   Expect to be going North soon   We have all had enough of Upper Egypt.  The natives do not like us down here- more Mohammedans &amp; Copts.   Owing to the teaching of Australian one Copt in all innocence today approached me to sell fruit in Camp-  Baring his Arm he showed me the Coptic +  &amp; said "I'm a b--- Christian".
