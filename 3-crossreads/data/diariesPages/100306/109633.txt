Firing Line (Needle Tr.)
27/12/16 Played patience in the small hours of the morning and after many vain games found the pack was one card short. The intelligence summaries were slow in coming to hand and disclosed nothing of importance. 2 Huns gave themselves up to the Shropshires on our right. Our snipers killed a man in front of Zenith and a Lewis caught a party at Finch and put a magazine into them. Groans and cries were heard which died away after a few minutes. Our boys sniped hard and more groaning aloud followed. Slept during the morning but had some visitors in the shape of Col. Forbes, Col. Bridges G.S.O.1 and Colonel Cary R.E. and we decided to shift this H.Q. further ahead when chance arises. A man wounded today by one of our own shells falling short and it was not the only one. Put in a strong report about it. Some heavy shelling round here this afternoon. Word came that we could send 11 men on leave and I decided to send men right from the desolation of the front
