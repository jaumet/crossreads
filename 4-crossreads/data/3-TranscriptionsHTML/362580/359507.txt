<p>but quieter these last few days, so are having a whole day off to-morrow &ndash; all we old ones are having it in turns.  The new ones are releiving us.  I had this afternoon too.  Matron is trying to arrange for us all to have a day &amp; a half &ndash; so things are looking-up.</p>
<p>Last Sunday afternoon I went out with a party from here to see A Religious procession (R.C.) at the Virgins Well &amp; the Holy Tree &ndash; It was most impressive.  We drove out in Gharreys &amp; got there at 3.30 p.m. left there &amp; the drive back to Heliopolis was lovely &ndash; a most beautiful sunset, the days are very short now &amp; the sun sets about 5.15 p.m.</p>
<p>We reached The Palace about that time, met Sister Ester Hart &amp; three of us (Sister Bonnin &amp; self) went into Cairo to Church.  6 p.m.  Enjoyed the service very much &ndash; the church was crowded but we got a seat.  Returned in time for 8.30 p.m. dinner &amp; then to bed.  Slept soundly all night.</p>
