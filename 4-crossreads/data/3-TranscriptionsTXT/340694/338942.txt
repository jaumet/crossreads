2/11/16Got away from Steenvoorde alright in the car & spent 3 or 4 days in Ailly le-Haut Clocher. Left there yesterday & are now in Vignacourt & have a very nice billet. Am a member of H Qrs NCO's mess now & am living well. It's not known how long we will be here.
At Ailly the folk where we messed were fine. Fell in love with Ernescile a rosy cheeked damsel with roguish eyes.
