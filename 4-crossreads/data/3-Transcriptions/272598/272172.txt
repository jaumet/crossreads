<p>out in consequence of yesterdays happening, as usual all suffer for a few.  No bearers allowed out of camp in addition to leave being stopped.  Sent on duty to Edge Hill C.C.S.  Had a couple of packets of P.C's sent from Amiens one to Balmain &amp; the other home.</p>
<p>Monday 16.4.17<br/>All bearers standing to, to again go out to line.  Plenty fatigues to fill in the time. Fritz heavily counter attacked &amp; drove our boys back some considerable distance, but our chaps attacked again &amp; drove the Huns still further back than they started from &amp; inflicted very heavy casualties on him.</p>
<p>Tuesday 17.4.17<br/>Hanging on</p>
