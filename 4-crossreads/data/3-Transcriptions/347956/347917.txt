<p>11.3.15</p>
<p>Thurs 11th<br/>Still on light duties although I feel well enough for anything;  another windy, dusty day; No parade for the troops, some of the men from the troops were told off this morning to learn signalling but I think they are starting too late to do much good at it;  Went to Luna Park after tea to witness some boxing contest, the principal event being between an <strike>Irish</strike> ex-champion welter weight of Ireland &amp; a lad from the South Australian Light Horse;  It was a good fight &amp; the Irishman won in the third round;  Plush was with me &amp; we had a feed at the New Zealand Cafe</p>
