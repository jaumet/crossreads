 We arrived at Oghratina OK about 6 last night &amp; took up our position in the same old place at dawn the different Regts moved out, one to Saqia the other to Debabis &amp; then commenced there advance on Oghratina burning &amp; clearing all the Hods on the way in &amp; very soon a huge ring of fires were to be seen the 2nd Regt got 5 prisoners at Saqia &amp; another five got away, they being too fast for our horses, they run up the banks &amp; slide down the other side while the horses have to go round,  we finished up at 2 pm we had a great signal station on the old battlefield &amp; were in touch in all directions. 
 Moved back to Romani at dusk &amp; got in amongst our tea at 11.30.

 Had a quiet day today, nothing doing, the men went down for a swim after dinner &amp; it went great, plenty of surf etc, the horses enjoyed it even more than we &amp; several of them you could not get out of the water. 
 Got home in time for tea &amp; then wrote letters to home. 
 Nelson communications were up to putty again yesterday &amp; an inquiry is to be made into it today as to how he employed his signallers &amp; what he did with them.
