After leaving the trenches we were all marched to the village of 
Ecort St Quentin & were put in a large church for the night, after having my wound dressed. It was very painful. The interior of the church was in an awful state, some of the interior fittings were broken & destroyed, others had been removed. The night was bitterly cold & it was impossible to get any sleep.

The next day Thursday we were moved by rail to another village where we were put into barns to sleep for the night.
The next day I had my wound dressed again, It was very sore & the Germans were none too careful when attending to it.

At 4.0 o`clock we entrained for Germany after being seperated from the unwounded men. The men that were unwounded were taken to Germany, but kept at work behind the German front Line, Where in time the Majority were either killed by Germans or our own artillery fire, Some managed to get through
