<p>had three wings on them. They seem to be able to climb up in the air like climbing a steep hill. The other 'planes have to mount up circling as they go but these ones seem to mount straight up.</p>
<p>Jun 4th. Mon<br/>Took a walk by a circular route round by the village of Meteren. Expected to be transferred to the Dressing room staff but the S. Specialist would not allow it. A bit of a squabble. I desire to get on the D. Staff but others want to keep one on the O.T. Staff.</p>
<p>Early this morning, just at day break an enemy 'plane dropped a bomb right on to an ammunition train which was lying at a railway siding, near the town. The train went up in flames. The vibration from the bursting of the ammunition was something terrific. Every few minutes explosion, shook the earth and buildings.</p>
<p>Interested in what was going on I went into the square. There one found scarcely a window whole, each vibration of bursting shell shook the houses and shop and smashed their windows causing glass to clatter all around.</p>
<p>Women and children were running across the square in a direction away from the disturbance</p>
<p>Children were hanging on to their mothers frock</p>
