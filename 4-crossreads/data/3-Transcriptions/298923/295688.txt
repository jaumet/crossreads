<p>22 January 1918 Tuesday<br/><strike>Richon-Le-Zion is shown on most maps as Ayan-Kara.</strike><br/>Anzac Div. Headquarters are in Baron Rothschilds house in <strike>Richon-Le- Zion-</strike> Nicely furnished, water laid on, two storied, standing among Oranges &amp; Palms- with a photo of the baron on the wall-  He settled many Jews here &amp; the Richon Winery is one of the biggest in the world-  The Turks damaged nothing.<br/>Rode 8 miles into Jaffa or Joppa  &amp; bought colored book of Holy Land cities in German!! but the colouring is <u>absolutely correct</u> &amp; you will be safe in copying if you can find time <strike>little Mother</strike> to paint.  I searched the Town for this, the only one so hope it arrives safely</p>
