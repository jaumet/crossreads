  
 time, we are kept going plenty of parades. 8.8.18 Le Quesnay. Yesterday we were on loop set wireless, had a very interesting morning. Today we were on the Power Buzzer & Amplifier, which is quite as interesting. This afternoon I was trying to take the wireless from the Eiffel Tower Paris, which was sending out war news. But as it was in international code, could not get it all. The Eiffel Tower sends out war news every afternoon to the world. Aug. 8th 18. Le Quesnay. Today we have been on a scheme, had breakfast half an hour earlier &  received  finished up at 4.15. I had a very easy day, & did very little. The war news now is exceptionally food, especially as it comes so soon after the Chatteau Theirry German defeat. Aug. 15th. 18 Le Quesnoy Am doing the first guard that I have ever done, though this is a very poor sort of one. We have the school on the 17th I believe.
