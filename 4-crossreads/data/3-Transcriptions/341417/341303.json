<p>Fear of God, Endurance of Earthly Hardships, opens the Hearts of the Wicked and gives Knowledge to all. R.T.W.<br/>May be you think I am getting a bit of a psalm singer more-or less, but I cannot help being a little insane, at times I consider the Fijian has more brains and common-sense in his simple life than my civilised educated Fast life.</p>
<p>Those socks came in very handy and the trinkets were amusing I remember seeing those two nails at home now I come to think of it.</p>
<p>I have not recieved any letters from you lately either from Uncle Jim but hope to get a big mail soon. Hoping this letter finds you and your family all in the best of health as this leaves me at presant. Remember me to all I know.</p>
<p>I remain<br/>Your Affectionate<br/>Brother<br/>R. T. Wharton.</p>
