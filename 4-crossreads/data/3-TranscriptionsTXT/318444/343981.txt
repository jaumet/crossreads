 Mon March 25th Hurriedly taken out of reserves without doing our turn in the front line. I suppose it is owing to "Jerry's" big push down south &amp; we are now at Tournai Camp situated at  Confuasion Corner awaiting a move. 
 Tues March 26th Not moved yet though 3rd DIV. has gone &amp; the 4th DIV. are said to be well into the stoush by this. 
 Tues April 2nd 1918:- We had our Easter Monday yesterday at the Tournai Camp in peace &amp; left today by light railway to  Reninhelst. Marched out a few miles to a cap at Hoograaf situated about a mile from Poperinghe. Nissen huts 
 Fri Apr 5th:- Left Hoograaf at 8 pm &amp; marched to Godewaersvelde. 
 Sat Apr 6th:- Entrained at 1 a m &amp; passed through Calais, Etaples, Abbeville, Longpre, Hangest (where the 2nd Bde disentrained) &amp; on to the St Roch station at Amiens. Marched on to Rainnville (6 &frac12; miles) &amp; billeted. Motor wagons are mostly engaged in carrying wounded through &amp; there are plenty of rumors flying around about the "Aussies" being left in the lurch.
