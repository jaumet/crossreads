  
 19th Dec. 15 We are still at Anchor & likely to be so for a while. I saw this morning one of the prettiest sunrises I have ever witnessed, it seems to be a regular thing in these parts. One of the N.Z. Transports has gone over to the wharf & is unloading Troops & baggage now. An Indian Transport came in last night, loaded with Troops, & is at anchor not far from us.  There seems to be something "doing" up the Canal as 3 Warships went up this morning. The "Natives" are all round this Boat selling things & it is funny to see our Chaps take them in.  They want Sixpence for a Newspaper, but some of the boys give them a Ha'penny, snatch the Paper & run.  We held Church Service on board & it sounded very well on the Harbour.  We seem to be the only Boat with a Band on Board. Some of the Egyptians are the biggest thieves unhung, it is just as well that they wont let them all come on board. This afternoon the Boys knocked one of the Egyptians over as he was carrying a bag of oranges on board
