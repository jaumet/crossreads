Two newspapers, Table Talk & The Sydney Mail, from Mrs Knowles are the last packages to hand for me.  Suppose must be content.  Of course with mine one source of delay is, Coghlan's office in London passes the correspondence to some body of Colonials, to do the forwarding.  It is just like Coghlan and his officials.
