<p>Sake keep John &amp; Arthur back. One is quite enough &amp; I have got their share of Germans &amp; am still good for a mob yet. There are a lot of the boys get shell shock. I'm blowed if I can. When I was hit the shell was not three yds above me &amp; I hit the ground like lightening. The force from the explosion is terrible. I was up quick &amp; lively &amp; found I was punctured in the thigh. Dont worry over my wound as it is not serious &amp; I will have at least ten weeks spell.<br/>I recieved all your letters &amp; the snap shot of the stall.<br/>Well there is a chance of us being home for Xmas, but dont build on it. By Jove Mum, the <strike>Schot</strike> Scotties are the boys. The Germans are terribly frightened of the Kilties &amp; they can fight never retire &amp; never take prisoners. Dont forget to keep this news to yourself. I dont know how Lloyd Davies got on he joined the 18th the last two days they were up there &amp; was in the charge I expect It was his first time under fire &amp; by jove it was rough.<br/>Hoping you are all well Best wishes &amp; love<br/>Your loving Son<br/>Tom.</p>
