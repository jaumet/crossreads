Fine, but cold. Grooming horses
all the morning & in the afternoon
we had to harness up & swap
all our black horses harness &
everything to the 118th Battery
for their grey horses & dirty old
harness. We got a very bad
deal, but it was orders & had
to be done. Saw an observation
balloon brought down in
flames. They are having a
hell of a "strafe" today & after
dark the sky was just lit
up with flashes of guns.
