<p>We caught the lighter without as much minus as we expected and crossed over, a voyage of 30 minutes or so, to Skutari and there were appointed to two horse trucks in which we were to travel the long long trail to <strike>Madana</strike> Adana at least and possibly further along in the Damascus direction.  Rogers and self were left to stand by baggage and trucks and as we were to sleep in 'em and were not getting a start until next morning we did not lose a second in getting one of the trucks converted into some sort of kitchen.  A carpenter belonging to the Railway and two others of some lesser calling made several attempts to help and I honestly believe that their intentions were sound and not actuated by a desire for buckshee but unfortunately not one of 'em was worth a damn at the very simplest boys guide to carpentry stunt.  So it was tunics off, and thanks to odd pieces of cases, stolen nails, borrowed hammer &amp; saw we got together a table, seats, meat safe &amp; other receptacles likely to be useful.</p>
<p>On long journeys crowding is the great trouble, a little loneliness seems priceless even when one is with the right kind of people so I appointed myself as cook's orderly &amp; Rogers is cook and my "Superior".</p>
