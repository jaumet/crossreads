<p>I see the dear old school house<br/>Where we spent some happy days<br/>As bathed in golden glory<br/>From the suns last glowing rays<br/>Those days I cant forget dear<br/>Oh could they with me only stay<br/>What things I would as different<br/>As I go through each long day.<br/>They are the happiest days<br/>of memories golden store<br/>And could I but go back again<br/>I would not ask for more<br/>But still the years go by my friend<br/>And seasons come &amp; go,<br/>Many lives are made &amp; marred<br/>In this world of weal &amp; woe<br/>But the sunshine &amp; the shadows,<br/>they both walk hand in hand<br/>Until our cares &amp; sorrows<br/>Pass unto a better land<br/>But the memories of the past</p>
