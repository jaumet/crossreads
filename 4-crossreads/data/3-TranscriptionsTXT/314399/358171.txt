Monday 23 June 1919Cold & windy today. We got the 9 am boat. Janet & Violet came down to see us off. Got the train to Glasgow. Arthur met us there & after taking our luggage to Queen St Station we went out to Alice's for lunch. Saw them all. Broke the news & they were all pleased. Came to Edinburgh & Janet went to visit pals whilst I went to Corstorphine. Told Auntie & she was pleased. Saw Adolph again. He annoys me. I put up with him tho. Met Janet at Frasers. We told them & poor Janet got a lecture. Had a huge rush for our train but got a whole compartment to ourselves whilst the rest of the train was packed.  A guard even locked the door for us. Had a bonny sleep.
