11/3/18 La Basse Ville
almost impregnable place. On three sides are is a deep wide and unbridged moat full of water. They enemy evidently strafed hell into this place but even his biggest shells make but little impression on its wall of solid concrete feet thick. We crawled inside and found it quite habitable and also chanced on many belts of Hun machine gun ammunition and old beer and mineral water bottles. The surrounding trenches are delapidated. Walked back to bed but constant visits and all sorts of interruptions occurred until afternoon. Slept then all night. At 10.30 we raided on the left Divnl front brought back 6 prisoners no casualties. The two rear coys here relieved the firing line without incident
