<p>Wednesday 17 February 1915</p>
<p>No early morning parade this morning, and only a short 9-11 parade after breakfast.  At 2 p.m., the battalion was assembled and moved off at full strength, on bivouac for the night.  The transports and travelling kitchens accompanied the main body, so that there were only a few left in camp &ndash; those on the sick list, including myself, the guard and only the absolutely necessary fatigue parties.</p>
<p>If you have ever been in a deserted or partially deserted military camp, you will recognise my feelings of to-day.  A shadow of dull dreariness and great loneliness seems to spread over the whole place.  The contrast is so marked.  Instead of the busy life and bustle of a camp, uniformed men rushing hither and thither, you have the almost lifeless step of the sick men &ndash; those who are marked on the sick report as "light Duties", who do not go on parade but are responsible for all the light fatigues.  Then there are the sentries, ever on the move along their respective beats.  But they are always there, you are quite accustomed to seeing them that they are part and parcel of the camp.  An empty camp is a far more dreary affair than is a house, half full at the theatre.  In fact, to some, it is intolerable.</p>
