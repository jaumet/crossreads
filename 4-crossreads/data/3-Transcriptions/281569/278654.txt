<p>10 April, 1916 Monday</p>
<p>78 wks from home</p>
<p>Hopped out at usual time.</p>
<p>Nothing to do at all only messed round to fill in time &amp; at lunch time went out for the usual ride to the Palms.</p>
<p>More "willys" visit us today &amp; 5 were to be seen in the air at once &amp; as usual heaps of wind &amp; dust accompany them, the niggers don't seem to mind how many there are.</p>
<p>Burrell rang up against a nigger last night &amp; got two lovely black eyes, he was after a writing pad but finding none at this particular place he walked off when the nig called him back &amp; quilted him one each in either eye, Frank then pitched into him &amp; gave him a few beauts, the nig [indecipherable] off for his life, [indecipherable] then gave him in charge for assault.</p>
<p>Played cards &amp; turned in early. 10 pm.</p>
<p>11 April, 1916 Tuesday</p>
<p>Revielle as usual</p>
<p>Burrell's eyes look lovely &amp; at lunch time the nigger came down to be examined by Col Dixon, &amp; he got well-nigh killed by our chaps. I ran over him with the bike for one &amp; now I don't think he will trouble us too much although we expect to give him a rough house, he's by no means unmarked either.</p>
<p>Chas Cox again off duty for bad feet &amp; it looks as if they are going to take some curing. Opie too is still suffering from the effects of his fall off Kute so Wills &amp; Watkins have been told off to take their places temporally.</p>
<p>Pulled my old bus down again, she was in splendid condition inside despite a little carbon, the niggers amused themselves pulling the pump handle up once or twice.</p>
<p>Mail in a few days. Bed 9.10.</p>
