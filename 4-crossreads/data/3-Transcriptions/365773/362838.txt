<p>now. I am looking forward to it, although you know the old saying re the cup &amp; the lip. The trouble in most of our units is:- we have a lot of senior officers away wounded, sick etc. &amp; they are holding up promotion. I now have a horse which is an acquisition on a route march.<br/>I am very fit now in fact never felt fitter in my life - we are getting a decent Battalion together again, the heads wisely promoted a lot of old N.C.O's to commisioned rank, naturally being a ranker myself I think they make the best officers, in our democratic army anyway.<br/>I will close now with fondest love to R B &amp; Self from your loving brother Ken</p>
