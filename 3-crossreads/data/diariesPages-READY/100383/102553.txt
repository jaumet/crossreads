 
February & March 1917

& strengthening our position of a night. Our stay only last 52 hours there & we were not troubled much although he tried to find our position with artillery, trench mortars & machine guns but we only had four casualties in the company. It was well into the night of the 1st of March when we were releived by the 5th battalion & then moved back to dug outs in the maize. We stayed six days there & during that period I was able to have a good look over the ground which fritz first evacuated & it was no wonder he did so for his 1st 2nd & 3rd lines where simply torn to pieces by our artillery & his dead were very thick everywhere & he had mines set everywhere too but luck favoured us & all of these were unloaded without suffering any Casualties. We were relieved from this position on the night of the 7th by the 20th Battalion & moved back to Bazentin camp No. 2 & turn in about midnight all completely tired out for we had had a fairly strenuous time without much sleep the past eight days. We moved off next morning however but our march was not far & we went to Marmetz camp where we stayed a few days & was able to clean ourselves & felt much better. On the 16th we again moved off & went to the village of Dernancourt & it was my first visit to a village since the end of January & we were able to buy plenty of food & lived high during our stay there. On the 21st we marched to billets at Ribemont & on the 25th played the Brigade Trench Morter
