  
 any sickness aboard, "no" righto he said stand by & wait for instructions, while we were waiting the Y.M.C.A. distributed a lot of cards & we hurriedly scribbled a few lines & sent them off.  We did not stop more than an hour we then pulled out & are now getting for our lives down the Mediterrean under her famous blue sky & a glorious sun all are on deck sunning themselves.  I took 3 snaps of old Gib. in different positions.  I have always wanted to see this world famous fort of ours & now I am satisfied for we could not have had a more perfect day & a more glorious view & I shall never forget how she stands like a sentinel on guard watching the opening to two oceans & also keeping an eye on Africa she is a never to be forgotten sight as you swing out from the harbour & pass her end on, of all the massive bold steep rocks as ever I have seen she is easily first & no wonder she is classed as the most impregnable fortress in the whole world & valued by England as she is.
