 Wednesday 17th Jan. The day of my return. Called at Cloak Room Charing Cross for a tunic & waterproof cape given me by Ramsay & later left mine there for him to pick up & keep for me. Saw my friends off to Winchester & went out with Mrs. Furber as she wanted   me  to buy me a scarff for a present as I had lost mine. After that I picked up my gear at the Hotel & went to Waterloo to catch the 4 P.M.
