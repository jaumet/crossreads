 Monday 14 May 1917. 
 Up at 6.30 am. Feeling crook, but soon seemed to pick up again. 
 Sea at present not quite so rough.&nbsp; Nothing in sight but water. &nbsp;All the boats in sight number 10 transports, 2 cargo boats &amp; 2 destroyers. &quot;Warrego&quot; &amp; &quot;Encounter&quot; 
 We have now caught up the boats from Sydney. Seas heavyâ€•boat shipping a few. 
 &quot;Shropshire&quot; in front of us rolling terribly. Able now to stand it down below. Took 2 snaps of &quot;Shropshire&quot; rolling. Went below &amp; wrote 6 letters. 
 Glad to turn in at 6 p.m. as the seamen told us that towards morning we would be entering &#39;the bight. &nbsp;Have now turned West towards direction of the Bight.
