I noticed the mosaic was reproduced in the Australasian lately.A man named Miller from Mathoura came into my Tent & wanted to know how to become a "Stock Inspector"!!  He said he knew Joe & had been a drover!!There are 20 1st L.H. buried in cemetery among young Gum Trees & 4 miles out among 38 of the 4th & 12th & where my old Sergeant Major lies Paddy Lenehan.
