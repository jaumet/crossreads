<p>an Australian Guard placed. Amongst these troops there must have been some one with an artistic temperament. On the slope of the bank of the canal they had sketched by means of small white stone, huge diagrams, one depicting the map of Australia marked of into the states and encircling the map were the words, "A part of a Great Empire". Another was a sketch of a British Cruiser, and the other was the engraving which is to be found on the Australian shilling, the Kangaroo and the Emu with the words "Advance Australia".</p>
<p>Large numbers of Egyptian barges loading up the white stone which is being used to make the roads across the desert. This stone is being brought down on Light Railways probably from the Mokattam Hills.</p>
<p>There was much amusement caused by one of the small trucks running away and upsetting as it collided with some trucks standing stationary on the line.</p>
<p>The canal widens considerably as we approch the Lake of Timnah. On the banks of the Lake there is a great deal of sparse scrub and large numbers of wild duck are to be seen flying about.</p>
<p>As we entered the wide expanse of water which is called the lake we could see a number of battle ships, one was anchored right in the centre of the canal, apparently a French Destroyer called the "Requin". High up in the air, above the other side of the lake, was a huge observation balloon which was brought down soon after we reached Ismaelia.</p>
<p>Ismaelia is a fair sized place and a number of pretty villas,</p>
