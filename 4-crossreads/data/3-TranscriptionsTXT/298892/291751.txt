 France, Wednesday, 22nd. August 1917. 
 My dear Parents/. Since my last letter home I received a long and most interesting letter from mother. Your recollections of Ireland make me long to make the trip and I should have the opportunity now very shortly.  When we are out here in the country resting some of the men are going on leave every week and as soon as I consider I am sufficiently financial I will put in an application. Each man is allowed ten clear days leave in England but before proceeding he must show ten pounds in cash or else have that amount to his credit in his pay book. I have been existing on half pay for some time and have now almost the requisite amount but I would prefer to wait awhile and amass a little more as some of this will go in travelling expenses.  Of course, even after I apply it might be months before leave is granted as only a few go at a time. I think it amounts to twelve per week from the Brigade that is three from the Battalion (almost 1000 men) although half of these would not be eligible owing to the money difficulty and about a quarter have already had leave.  I have not written to or heard from the Healys for some-time. I wrote last thanking Mrs. Healy for a nice sweater she forwarded but I will re-open the correspondence as perhaps my letter went astray. It must be very lonely in the house by yourselves but I daresay Kit will have returned long before this is posted and will be enlivening you with accounts of her numerous triumphs amongst the knighted college youths.
