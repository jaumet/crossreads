<p>Sunday 3 October, 1915</p>
<p>Have been given clearance certificate which will take me off the Peninsula. I am sorry in a way because I don&#39;t like leaving my pals but I am too jolly weak to do anything.</p>
<p>Mac &amp; Bernie helped me down to the beach hospital.</p>
<p>Mail came in today. Had a letter from Beryl &amp; Hilda. I am very disappointed at not getting one from the Mater.</p>
<p>As soon as I got to the beach hospital Beachy sent a shrapnel along which splatted all over the cases that we were behind &amp; hit one man in the arm, just a few yards away &amp; later killed a man in swimming.</p>
<p>Went aboard S.S. Hospital Ship Assaye.</p>
<p>Had a bit of stiff luck, lost my watch, may be lucky enough to get it back.</p>
<p>Met Bunny Abbot &amp; Arthur Taylor.</p>
