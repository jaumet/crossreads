  
 "Friend"  L. Gard 
 He had no gift of charm to win his way Into the hearts around                                      He had no dream heights where his thoughts might stray                                              He walked on common ground 
 But just because he eased the ruts of road                                                   Where comrade feet must wend                 Lifting, all cheerily, his own life load            He earned the name of "Friend"
