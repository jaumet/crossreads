<p>Gallipoli Peninsula<br/>5th September 1915</p>
<p>Dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>Since writing last week I have received Mother's letter of 12th July enclosing the cutting on "Father's Housekeeping" and also a letter from Pat dated 12/7/15.<br/>I am awfully glad to hear you are all keeping well, and the letters were most welcome of course. I think the article on housekeeping is splendid, but one thing I noticed, the Pater doesn't say whether cold or hot water was used for the washing up!<br/>Last week I received a letter from Sis dated 4th August also 2 cards from the children and the day following their receipt I had the enclosed cable. In view of the fact that I have written them regularly every week since they arrived in England I think this is about the limit. Of course I immediately sent them a cable saying</p>
