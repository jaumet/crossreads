March 19177th.   "Eternal Ally" is a sap between "Needle" & "Rose Trenches," in which is some time ago, our company made a "deep dugout" of considerable size   We are living in a part of this & with bunks made along the walls (cabin fashion) we are fairly comfortable.This morning I was detailed to take three sappers & work them in shifts of 8 hours each to take charge of infantry fatigues doing work for us, in the nature of carrying material.Our rations are sent down to us daily from "Warterloff Farm" & our water is carried from "Miller's Son," where a well has been dug by No 3 Section.
