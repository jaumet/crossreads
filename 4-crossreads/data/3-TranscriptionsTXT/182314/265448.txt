Corpl Ragnell
I have had cause to pull him up 2 or 3 times, but very slight improvement has been shown. Is a good and painstaking musketry instructor
Lance Corporal Lang
Steady man. Is fitted only for small jobs. Liable to be sulky, when given orders by a senior N.C.O. I cannot recommend his promotion.
Lance Corporal Mitchell
Has a good knowledge of his work, and sees that his orders are carried out. With a little more experience, I would have no hesitation in recommending his promotion.
Lance Corpl. Chamberlain
Has only a fair knowledge of his work, he can control a small party, is a fine built man, but has no soldierly bearing. I think he will not be fitted for some time for any appointment higher than corporal
Private Flanagan
Most reliable &amp; steady man. Has a good knowledge of general work, and can handle men. He would make a good N.C.O.
