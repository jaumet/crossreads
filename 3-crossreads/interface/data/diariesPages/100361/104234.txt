Thur. Ap. 25 - Anzac Day
Glorious sunshining day.
Had good dinner and some were supplied with Beer. I had none, but as it was heavily watered, did not miss much.
George Lawson, Tich and I attended the Sports in the afternoon. Two Bands were there and a good number of Ladies.
After Tea went into Warminster to the Pictures.
