Sunday 20
 Since last Sunday night I have been in bed in B.4 Ward looked after O.K. The nurses, VADs are very good
Monday 21
 the sisters vary. The head sister told me off a treat a few days ago for getting out of bed, but Sister Dobson has already introduced me to a very nice friend, who I think will be a lasting friend, Miss Jelly. The Officer in charge of the ward is Sir Alfred Pearce Gould a very eminent surgeon. 
 The weather lately
Tuesday 22
 has been wet thundery, but now it is again beautiful. Our ward is decorated with very nice flowers tulips, roses lilac. A character of an outback Australian occupies the bed opposite to mine. He knows Burro is a typical shearer the way he speaks to the head sister is very amusing.
