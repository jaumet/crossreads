11/5/18 Franvillers 
Slept all night in a bivouac that was a rude enough shelter. The little canvas cover was dug down about 2 feet below the level of the surrounding clover patch. Despite cold and too much air we all slept well. The day broke dull and chilly and looks like rain. There is a great tendency among our men to get hold of irregular dress. The morning when the horses went to water two men were wearing caps and two others wearing cap comforters. Intend to give Burke the SO a rousing in up about this. Breakfasted out in the open field. There is nothing but green grass and young crops everywhere. Last night was talking to two old Frenchmen who recalled the War of 1870 and the Battle of Pont Noyelles. These men were ploughing but their work as they said was "without heart" for they never know when an enemy advance will ruin all their labour and everything will destroyed. The spirit of this wonderful French nation is marvellous. In the village the little children and the women carry on where troops have been shifted out owing to the place being considered unsafe. The cellar is a very present help to them and their refuge in case of need. All have their gas masks of a French pattern for use in case of need.
