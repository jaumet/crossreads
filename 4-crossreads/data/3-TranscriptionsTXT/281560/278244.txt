4/5/16.Went to the "Bull Ring" and had instruction in grenades. Threw live Mills Hand Grenades and used rifle grenades. The hand grenades are peculiarly deadly; and it is a strange sensation to throw one for the first time. There was an accident with one today and the instructor and another was killed, and five were injured.5/5/16.To the Etaples Steam Laundry for a bath, and to wash my clothes. A big Australian mail was distributed. A very popular day.6/5/16. At the training ground today the company went through a sort of obstical race over high walls and trenches carring all our gear. Very strenuous.
