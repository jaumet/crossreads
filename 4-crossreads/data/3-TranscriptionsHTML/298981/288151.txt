<p>PART 1</p>
<p>Chapter 1</p>
<p>From Australia to Gallipoli</p>
<p>The first and second contingents of the Australian Imperial force were fine, typical Australians with their strong muscles, brawny faces, well over the average height, of a determined and adventurous disposition.</p>
<p>They were tired of the daily routine of an office <strike>life</strike>, industrial or country life. And when in August 1914 England declared war on Germany  their imaginations were immediately raised.  A spirit of rebellion and excitement fired their restless and adventurous minds. They wished to see  life, the world, and real fighting of which they had heard so much of and read so much about, but the realities of which they had little or no experience, except a few Boer war veterans who were intermingled through this vast host of Australia's manhood.</p>
<p>It was not good of them to join hands with England they reasoned.  It was Australia's war as much of the Mother country's.  Australia's freedom was of more value to them than the precious air they breathed which was in grave danger of German domination.</p>
<p>So it happened that during the early days the flower of Australian's manhood flocked to the barracks, and various recruiting depots, and voluntarily offered their services to their king and country.</p>
<p>Camps of temporary standing were erected at the most convenient localities, and every use was made of the pavilions and sheds</p>
