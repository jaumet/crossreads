  
 April 1915 last minute.  The boat left at 3.30pm & I caught the 6.10 train back to Cairo arriving at 12.30.  It was too late to get back to camp.  I was tired so I stayed in town all night. 
 Tuesday 13th Got the 8.15am train back to camp.  The Regt was out on a field day, so I settled down to read Austn papers I got on the boat.  The day was very hot & dusty & the worst yet experienced this summer. 
 Wednesday 14th All the Regt went out to gully past quarries & formed a perimeter camp.  We dug trenches & built a wall & had explained to us how it just would be occupied in real hill warfare.  I was assisting the farrier in the afternoon.  Got letters from Roy Blair & Doug & wrote of Roy & Doles at night.
