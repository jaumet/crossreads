5 April 1915Monday 24 wks from homeRevielle at 6.I've never experienced such a day for one of the Philmus winds sprung up at 4 oclock blowing right off the desert. They're called 50 dayers for they say that they blow for that period at a stretch. Dust! why we know what dust really is the horses are nearly stifled with it. To make matters worse I had to go to the Barrage (31 mls) to take an order to the 2LH who were swiming their horses there its a most beautiful place possibly the finest of its kind in Egypt a most beautiful bridge spans the river & opens out into a lovely park about 1/4 of a mile long. I then had to go to Mena to visit the 3rd Troop on bus for PSM Latham. Got home at 2.5 in time for more dust. We live, breathe, sleep & eat it now. Mail arrives at 3 I get 6 one from Nell & the rest from home Bed at 8.30
6 April 1915Tuesday
Revielle at 6.30Stables as per usual after break I got on to the bikes & gave it a thorough over haul. The Sergeants position in the 1st Reg has been filled by Billy Nelson. Got news yesterday that Arthur Fox killed himself whilst riding his J.A.P. Received a letter from [indecipherable] who gave us the exact destination of our chaps. Another mail arrives & I get two more from Nell real beauts. Whilst shaving the morning I cut about two inches of my nose off with the razor. Bert Larkin asked me where I placed his towel & in returning my head I ran foul of the razor. Heard that we are off within 14 days to Alexandria & to go into Barracks. Toby has been appointed to home defence & is going crook some & J Shaw likewise. Spend the evening reading & writing letters Bed at 9.10 pm
