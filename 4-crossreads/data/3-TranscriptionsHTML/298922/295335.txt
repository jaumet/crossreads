<p>Left Sheik Zowabin at midnight &amp; attacked Rafa 1st L.H. in advance, after riding all night we were not too fresh but our boys kept up their tradition &amp; after a long day's fighting we captured the position by 5 o'clock together with 4 guns 2 machine guns &amp; all personnel &amp; Slova.</p>
