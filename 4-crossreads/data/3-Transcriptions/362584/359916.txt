<p>"Koyong"<br/>Forbes<br/>6th June 1918</p>
<p>My dear Mrs Ferguson</p>
<p>Thank you so much for repeating Ronald's cable on to me yesterday &ndash; but I am at a loss to understand it &ndash; I don't know what he means by saying "returned to duty" &ndash; I did not know he had been away, did you? &ndash; I wonder if he had been sick again &ndash; I have not had a letter from him for a long time.</p>
<p>I am glad to say my other two wounded lads are progressing favourably, Willie the elder of the two is on furlough &ndash; Jack is still in France &ndash; I had a letter by this mail from Willie written in Hospital, telling me how the accident occurred &ndash; they were in action in front of Amiens, had been there for two days &amp; in the afternoon of the 3rd day about 2 o'clock they were very busy with their Gun &ndash; firing 4 rounds to the minute. Willie was taking the time &amp; Jack laying the fuse &ndash; then all at once Willie said he found himself hit the ground &ndash; he got up at once &amp; ran towards his brother, &amp; he said great</p>
