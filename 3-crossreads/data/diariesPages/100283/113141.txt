stock of knowledge concerning bombs explosives etc. 
In the afternoon all the bombers Trench Mortar people had an hours ceremonial drill, at this school officers and all have to carry rifles it was dead funny to watch the antics of some of them, after this a march home a lecture on German bombs to finish the days work 
They have a number of German prisoners working on and around this school they will eat anything the poor devils can't be too well fed judging by their wan looks what they eat, I have seen them picking the scraps out of the slop tubs eating them greedily, our chaps always give them what is left off the tables you should see them dwelling on this.
