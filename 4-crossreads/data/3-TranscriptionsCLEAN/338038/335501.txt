  
 [Letter from Genl. W.L.H. Burgess] [Edge of letter obscured] In the Field. France, 27th Aug. 1918 
 Dear Sir, I am so glad to [kn]ow that my letter to you [was] of some help & comfort [in] your sorrow & loss.  I always feel when [wri]ting how very inadequate XXX are common words [and?] [phr]aseology in endeavouring to [conv]ey sympathy in sorrow such [as] yours. To know that they have [been] helpful, does much to [lessen?] this feeling of inadequacy,
