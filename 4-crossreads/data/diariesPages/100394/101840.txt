Just heard tonight that Bruce Elliott was simply blown to pieces during the last attack I must try and look Clive up as they were very much attached to one another Romania has declared war on Turkey and Russians have again taken Lemberg. Our boys have also taken observations Hill on the Somme one of the most important positions on the whole front and the Tommies have tried for months in vain to take it.

Posted long letter home. Going into Fleurbaix this afternoon. Jack Burke and I spent a very pleasant afternoon in town. Had a good meal of eggs and chips. I never saw such beautiful eggs as one gets here, much larger generally than any one sees in Australia. Fleurbaix must have been a fine little town at one time and I can’t understand why civilians remain the place as it is shelled severely every day.

August 3I was on duty at 30th Batt H.Q. today at F.O.O. So far the 8th Brigade has been disappointing. Fritz has them bluffed. They don’t like us shooting at all as Fritz retaliates, but the moral effect of his shells is much greater than the actual damage he does. They asked today for a certain number of men to volunteer for a raid in 3 weeks time but couldn’t get them. However I don’t believe in this volunteer business at all as all the best men volunteer and the other don’t.

August 4Got back about 10 a.m. from F.O.O. The boys managed to get some eggs for us for breakfast. Slept all day as I never had a wink all night as I was on duty from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. and have to go on again tonight. This continual night work plays on one so we will welcome reinforcements. The last few days we have been preparing our winter’s quarters about ¼ mile down the road and will have everything ready before moving in this time
