<p>November 1918.<br/>Saturday 2</p>
<p>Hosptl. Birmingham<br/>I've certainty had a very pleasant surpise today. My beloved brother paid me a visit and I was ever so pleased to see his smiling face again. He is going to get me to Southall and that place will do me. I know Mac, Preston and Milliard also Barron are four names that I want to remember. Roy left for London this afternoon.</p>
