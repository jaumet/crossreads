Fine but it was very cold & miserable. I was on the manure waggon in morning & went to Amesbury  & unloaded it about the stables all the afternoon. Saw Campbell about my transfer in evening & he said he would fix me up all right but I want a couple of particulars from Alan before sending in my paper.
