 MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 1919. 
 Hot &amp; dry. Tickle mustered 
 Wheelers Ewes to 4D Yards and we 
 marked them in the morning. Marked 
 69% on a shearing count, &amp; put 
 them back in Wheelers. I went up 
 to Top paddock and lopped after 
 Tickle got a couple of draught horses 
 from the station to shift Darby. 
 Darby came over and fished up 
 the pump from Middle paddock 
 bore. 
 Dad &amp; Peter went to Quirindi 
 &amp; back for lunch. All the Rowntrees 
 were out for the day.
