Then I observed and wondered at the supercilious expression of the Sphinx, that caused Napoloen's artillerymen to try and blow its nose off.

Have joined the bombing class under Leiut Loveday. The work is interesting, and we have a saying that "a change is as good as a spell." We went down into the native gardens near Zeitoun for periscope practice today. Heard the song of the Camel Drivers.
