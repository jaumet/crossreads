 6th Dec. 1916 . Just a year to the day sinc I land back on the " Karoola " in Sydney . [ From his previous servic in the Australian Armi Medic Corp ] Well , it was a beauti day on the 4th and no less than 17 of the huge observ balloon were up . These stretch away to Combl front on our right , and along the British line to our left ? the Somm upper . Fricourt lie just behind us a coupl of mile with Albert in our left rear about the same distanc . Baupaum , [Bapaum ] on which we are concentr our interest as present , lie about 7 mile straight in Front of us . Our camp is right besid Mametz Wood with the South Africa n 's nightmar ? Delvill Wood ? ( call Devil Wood by them ) , to our right front . The fourth , be a fine sunni day , brought the aircraft out like a flock of migrat bird . There are so mani that they are quit uncount . Hundr and hundr of plane are up at onc . Everi now then a Taub , think it saw an open to get abov one of our observ balloon , would dart out over our line . A rapid churn of propel , a congreg of our machin ? all spit fire , a few report from the anti-aircraft gun , and Fritz either sacrific himself to get his object , or think better and beat a hasti retreat . Sometim he is too quick , and , get abov the stationari helpless balloon , drop an incendiari bomb . But sometim too , our anti-aircraft gun quick get their aim ; first a puff of smoke mani feet below ; second shot a short distanc underneath the Fritz machin , then , one which burst right amongst his vital , like a wound duck , he come crash to earth . Period the balloon descend . A few minut elaps , they rise again . Then , just a few round from the artilleri to test the rang , which , onc found , lead to troubl for Fritz 's line of communic . So , as I said befor , the fourth be fine sunni , the aircraft had the time of their live ? and incident , our heavi gun batteri opposit Baupaum , got their rang . They were pretti quiet till even .
