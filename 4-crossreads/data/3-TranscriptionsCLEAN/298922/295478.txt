 Here's one - a subaltern of the 7 L.H. wanted to buy some fowls from Bedouin - unable to talk clapped his arms & crowed. MEN on return to Camp would flap arms & crow whenever he came into lines (not being too popular). Later a Patrol brought in a Rooster & kept him alive till next day. Rooster crowed at dawn, shout from dug-out "STOP that row". Again Cock crowed "STOP that row" from the 1 dug-out. Then one of the Stable Picket rushed at the rooster with Bayonet saying "I'll cut your b- head off if you crow again" don't you hear the Officers order!!  The men are great wags & generally score.
