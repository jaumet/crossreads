  
 March, 1915 Monday 1 Dog tired from doing all I can to see the old Mosques & Drill etc. too but feel the opportunity should not be let go to see these wonderful old places. Beautiful Glass stained windows, black granite pillars, Alabaster columns & inlaid marble floors built 1000's of years ago & Tombs in every one. As for the present diseased beggars die daily around walls & are carted away & the drab slums are filthy but the Architects of old knew how to build. Trench digging & outpost work today.
