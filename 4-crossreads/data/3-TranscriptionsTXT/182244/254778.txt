What some think at Anzac.
1. "That if the Turks possessed one or two batteries more of Howitzers the position presently held would be untenable.
At the present moment there is no spot where bullets or fragments of shell cannot be land from the side of the enemy.
2. A large access of strength to the enemy would make their position practically impregnable."
The first I know as far as the landing  of shot & shell are concerned to be correct.
