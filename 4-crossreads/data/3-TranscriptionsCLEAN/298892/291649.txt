off a bath and a change are a rare relish.We witnessed some fine aerial duels whilst the weather was fine. First one hears the buzz of an engine and looking up some of our Aeroplanes can be seen making for the German lines. Before they get anywhere near them the Anti-aircraft guns open fire and one can seepuffs of smoke bursting out of the heavens all round the 'planes. It is shrapnel and how the aeroplane escapes is marvellous. On several occasions I have seen our planes surrounded by these bursts and still they glide tranquilly along way up in the heavens without the slightest deviation from their course. I haven't seen one brought down yet.Well I am afraid I am here for the duration of the war now. The men whom we relieved as A.M.C. detail had been right through the thickest of the fray in all parts of France and, none of them have been wounded. It is an unheard of thing for an A.M.C. man to be wounded on the front so I am quite safe as long as we remain here but have no prospects of seeing Blighty or Australia until we knock out Kaiser Bill
