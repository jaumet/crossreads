<p>of fighting ships in it.</p>
<p>31-5-18<br/>It was a beautiful morning here just like Sydney Climate. It makes one feel like jumping out of his skin. The boat we are on is the worst boat to live upon I could get the Decks are of Iron &amp; one slips all over the place, the food is awful.<br/>We left Lemnos Island the harbour I mean 7.30 PM. for the Dardanelles the lads a joyful at going. We passed the Shropshire as we going out the harbour I am told that she has been to England since we left her &amp; brought more troops to Lemnos Island for the Dardanelles.</p>
