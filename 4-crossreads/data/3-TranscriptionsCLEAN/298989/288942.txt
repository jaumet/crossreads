8/1/16It is 0400 and we are still on the go. Occasionally we stop at a station & native vendors run up and down calling out Orinkis (oranges) or Xecook! (eggs to cook)! The men buying and much shouting of Yallahoos &c. Most of the stations are well lit by electricity. The smell of Egypt is everywhere - a smell of wet straw with a bouquet of pigsty.
Reached Tel-el-Kebir in rain and darkness and received the cheering intimation no tents were on the spot and the men would have to sit down on the ground in the open until dawn. Fortunately it was not far from station to camp and as we swung along the usual slinging off was indulged in just to cheer us up. From round comfortable fires fellows would call out "No tents, boys!" "How do you like your eggs". The latter remark provoked the instant retort "As hard as your - dial". When we turned the men loose their first question was "who is in these tents (the few that were erected). On hearing they were reinforcements they immediately passed the word to "stand to" and slung all the reinforcements out on their ears! remarking that they were not going to stay out in wet & darkness & let cold footers have comfortable tents. Our veterans now consider themselves entitled to all the good things. Daylight came and found most of them lying out in the open with a waterproof sheet over their heads and the rest of the body getting wet.
