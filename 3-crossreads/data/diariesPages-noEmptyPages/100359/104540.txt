Saturday 15th
Peter came to see me, last night. His Batt. the 30th and the 29th marched away this morning about half past five. Their bands woke us up, and we turned out and watched them go by. The 57th and 58th Battalions came in this morning and took their places. To-day I was told off as Sanitary Police for 3 days, with "Mulga Bill", for a partner.
Sunday 16th
Church Parade, without a band, miserable. We miss the music now the 29th and 30th are away. Wrote to Lillenclosed number of snapshots. Sanitary Police is a good job, as we miss all Parades, and are not killed with hard work.
Monday 17th
Party of 12 went into Ferry Post for a swim. This number
32.
are to go in each day, so it's something to look forward to. We packed our tent around the sand bags and made it much cooler. It was read out to us on Parade this morning. The Light Horse had engaged with a party of Turks at a place called Jiff-Jaffa. We lost 1 man killed and 33 taken prisoners, four were wounded, also captured an Austrian Engineer Officer. This is the first scrap that has taken place since we've been on this Canal Defence, so we are all mighty interested. Tonight there is a Parade from 6 till 9, but thank the Lord I'll miss it as I'm Sanitary Police. 
Tuesday 18th?
Made one of a swimming party, Jack Keen and Mac also in the mob. They both brought their cameras and took several good snaps which I hope turn out alright. We enjoyed a swim in the canal, then we went into Ismalia, and had a good look around.
