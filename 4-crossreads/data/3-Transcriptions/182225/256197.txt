<p>1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 11 &nbsp; FEB.</p>
<p>Showery all day. Made a table for the Sargent Farrier in morning &amp; played cards in his tent all morning. We had a riding test in afternoon the biggest farce imaginable &nbsp;You rode about 20 ft &amp; back &amp; they say they can tell if you can ride or not by that. Cleaning harness in afternoon as well. The Colonel said we had looked after the horses well. Caught early train down &amp; came straight to Lisheen. Gave Linda a bit of a surprise as I told her last night I was on horse picket &amp; could not get off.</p>
