Last Wednesday, 4th October at about 2 am. we steamed into the harbour of St Vincent, in the Cape Verde Islands, West Coast of Africa.  The harbour is a shallow bay but it has the appearance and advantages of a good harbour, for it is protected by a large island directly opposite the township.  The Town is not large but like Cape Town, it is situated at the foot of a high hill and looks pretty &amp; well laid out.  I should say 30000 would cover native &amp; European population easily.  The niggers here are a fine athletic stamp, and are better than any I have seen at diving for money.  You can imagine our surprise on arriving at a Portuguese port to find two British men-o-war lying at anchor there.  But Britain is everywhere and leaves nothing to chance, and, since some of her transports were calling at this port, she was looking after them herself.  Several Portuguese gun boats were lying in the bay too, and their work is patrolling the islands which are a small compact group.  One of the boats was the \"Highflyer\"  which, you will remember, was responsible earlier in the war for the running down of the German cruiser \"Konigsberg\"  and for the sinking of the \"Frederick der Grosse\"  - an armed merchantman.  <br>\r\n\r\nWe only stayed here about 6 hours for sunset saw us out of the harbour.
