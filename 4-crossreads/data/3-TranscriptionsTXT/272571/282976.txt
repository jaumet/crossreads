As possession is nine-tenths of the law, that, in time of war was to us sufficient. We fixed up three stretchers on boxes and made comfortable beds. A box fixed up in the centre acted as a table and another box fixed up at the side took the place in our home of a cupboard. In it we kept a few books and our eating utensils. We cut holes in the walls of our dugout and fitting biscuit tins therein we kept some food safe from the interference of vermin, ants, rats etc. We got some old canvas and lined our walls as best we could to keep back the falling earth. On this canvas we stuck P.P.C. pictures cut from newspapers etc. The three different temperaments of the occupants of this mansion? Were shown in the choice of the wall decorations. B. had his part of the wall covered with photos of famous actors, D had his part covered with humorous drawings from Punch and other comical newspapers which we managed to get the hold of, while M's particular frame of mind was appealed to by placing cuttings, poetry, etc from newspapers on the wall. From the manner in which our home was decorated we found no end of mental recreation which passed many weary hours away.
