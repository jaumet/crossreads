<p>Wednesday 9th A great sameness about the days now hot weather &amp; calm seas &amp; the same routine of work.  There still continues the same sports for those at liberty with the inclination, cricket at present holding premier position.  Today the nurses from France played those from Palestine &amp; judging by the cheering and laughter, provided amusement if nothing else. At night four boxing contests were held, after which-  lecture with lantern slides was given on Lord Nelson, whilst the band rendered sweet music at the other end of the ship.</p>
<p>Thursday 10th Nothing fresh.  Evening brought with it a concert by the concert party, their best effort so far but endangered by the fact of items being given which date from the Ark. Why oh why  have we to suffer G.  and "Mad Karou" from every man who wishes to entertain his comrades?  Kipling I am sure never intended us to be tortured so</p>
<p>Friday 11th The same as yesterday only more so except we did a record run of 345 miles.  Boxing Contests at night.</p>
<p>Saturday 12th Listened to an oration on Palestine</p>
