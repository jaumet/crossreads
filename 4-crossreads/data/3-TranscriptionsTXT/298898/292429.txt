of 4 miles, receiving a great welcome from them. They were a typical old English family doing things in good style without any false nonsense. Had a few hits at golf that afternoon & ended up with a walk, sleety weather but exhilirating. At night had a long discussion on things in general with the eldest girl, a very brainy person & much travelled, quite a treat. Slept very well that night a thing I could not do in London.
Wednesday 10th January
Went for an 8 mile walk through very interesting country saw Milton's Cottage with many of his relics & then went onto the home of the Quakers. Here we visited the meeting house of the friends & saw other places of interest reaching the house about 1.30 after a very fine walk indeed. Milton's Cottage at Chalfont St. Peters and Quakers at Jordans, William Penn
