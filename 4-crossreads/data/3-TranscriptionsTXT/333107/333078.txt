 Wed 25.  The war news continues good. Had quite a bust day at the Dentist. Hughie Reid is warned for draft. After Tea went to Pictures and then on to Salv Army Hut, where we had some Tea and Jam Roll, which was mighty good. After that we attended a Sing Song. 
 Thurs Sept. 26 Just a year ago today, since I was wounded at Ypres. Reidy went away today. We were all issued with Comforts Fund Parcel which should have been handed out for last Xmas. There being a few months late did not make them any less welcome. They contained some "Aussy Cigs and Tobacco, which are a very pleasant change from the Issue Stuff. 
 After Tea dropped a few Lines to France. 
 Fri 29.  The Yanks had another "hop over" yesterday and got a few more thousand prisoners. Went on Sick parade this morning and got marked "Digitalis" for 7 days. Stayed in Camp and wrote a Letter. 
 Sat 28.  Busy day at Dentist. Bought a few Cards from Salvation Army Hut. 
 Sun Sept. 29.  Miserable, wet day. One good thing we had a jolly good Dinner, which made things better. 
 Went into Havre after Dinner. Had Tea at Y.M. Strolled around the City and returned to Camp by 8.35 to Rouelles. 
 Mon 30. 
 Glory: Alleluia. Got a big bundle of mail today. 8 Glorious long Letters from M.S. Good old Girl. I must do some writing now. I've got enough to keep me busy for weeks to come. 7 Letters from M.S. 3 from Mother, 2 from France, 1 from "Oniss", Bth'day Cards from M.S. and Nell. The wonderful Baby has arrived at last and is, of course, the most wonderful Boy in the world. B.E. will be kept buasy now, nursing and looking after "Young Hook" as Mother calls him. Lill sent 8 snapshots, which were simply delightful. Gee: M.S. does look bonnie. 
 Attended French Class at Y.M.C.A. But I won't be much good till I get a Book. 
 Tues Oct 1. 
 Took on a new Job this morning. In charge of drying Room. The dentist's wasn't a bad Job, but I can make a few francs at this Job and I want to buy something special for M.S. and "Young Hook" for Xmas.
