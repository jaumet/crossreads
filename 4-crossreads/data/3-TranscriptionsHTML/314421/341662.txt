<p>At a late hour I went to bed, in a hay loft on top of a stack of sheaves. It was "Tres bon".</p>
<p>Wednesday Sept 26.1917. (1150)</p>
<p>We were up early and left Merck St. Sievin at 8.a.m after a hasty &amp; scantly breakfast. We passed through the villages of Halte D Ouve , Ouve-Wilquin, Celety Bientiques, Wizernes, and Noir Carnet. Here we stopped an hour for dinner. This is a large town, with a busy railway station, many factories and many large quarries of white stone. All the country is very hilly, and the town is in a valley at the foot of a hill, the side of which has been quarried away leaving a perpendicular face of white stone, at the foot of which nestles the town. [Shorthand not transcribed.]<br/>Leaving Wizernes we immediately passed through the town of Blendequen on the Vae-de l'Aa a little stream passing through both the afore mentioned towns. Then we passed through a long stretch of farming country, which appeared to be a very prosperous district. We passed long fields of sugar</p>
