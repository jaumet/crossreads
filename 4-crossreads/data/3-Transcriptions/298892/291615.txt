<p>temperament this will mean a considerable tax.<br/>You need not worry on my account, since, at the expense of promotion, I have secured one of the safest jobs there are on a modern battle field. Why, in another year or so you will have me back again amongst the family and ready and willing to assist in taking some of the burden of the Office off your shoulders! The experience I am gaining now should stand me in good stead. Not that there is anything legal about it but it all helps to form up a character. I know that things can't be very bright in business circles during these perilous times but, please God, they will be over shortly and things will then soon revert to their normal conditions.<br/>Douglas, too, is forging ahead in fine style and it won't be long before he is launching forth on his own account and assisting to "keep the home fires burning".<br/>It would hurt us sorely, I know I can speak for Douglas as well as myself, if, after providing for us in every way, and lavishing affection upon us, we could not repay you in some small way. I myself am hopefully looking forward to the time when I will be able to have the satisfaction of doing something towards the support of the family in order that you may not be continually worried over money matters.<br/>I must beg you, in all sincerity, to make use of my small allowance to help things along. I know you are not in need of it, and, if you were, it would be all too small</p>
