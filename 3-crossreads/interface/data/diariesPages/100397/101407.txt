When we were coming through in The Train, Some English Red Cross Nurses heard that we were coming so they waited on the Rly Stn, for 3 hours, we arrived at 11 P.M. and were awakened, by the nurses - at first I did not know what was wrong. Thought we had to detrain, but soon found out that, the Nurses had just waked us up to give us some Chocolate and tell us how glad they were to welcome us to France. I guess we were glad to see them too, They were the First Ladies we had spoken too since leaving Perth ? They said they hoped some of us would come along to their hospital, when we got wounded. Now My Dear Mother I must stop, my hands are allmost too cold to write, Tell Bet that I will write her a letter soon. much Love to all from Your loving Son C.G.P.
