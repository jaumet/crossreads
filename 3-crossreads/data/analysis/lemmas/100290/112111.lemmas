 16 Decemb 1916 Saturday Up at 9 a.m. Feel a bit better . On duti at evacu point . Still the dull cold day . noth much do all day , but all thro night , Oh what graft . Hump heavi 13 stone patient thro the dark slush . Hardest work of my life . Snow today cold into the bargain . The wheel of truck a hors 's work .
