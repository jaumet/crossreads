<p>14th<br/>Passed small island thickly covered with palm trees.  Dozens of sailing boats out fishing, &amp; the remains of a wreck on a reef.</p>
<p>16th<br/>Very bad throat for 4 days, the after effects of vaccination.  Cured by ship's doctor.</p>
<p>20th<br/>Arrived at Aden, and began coaling.  The antics of the natives are very amusing, as they come alongside in small boats selling fruits, cigarettes, fish, etc., trade being conducted by means of small baskets tied to thin ropes.  Moored to same buoy as R.M.S. Morea.  On guard again.</p>
<p>21st<br/>Saw funeral of an infantryman from the Ceramic.  He was buried on shore, and we could see the coffin on a gun-carriage, covered by a Union Jack.  The battalion band and a party from the Ceramic formed the cortege.  Aden is a dry desolate looking place.  The coaling is done by niggers who make a most awful noise as they work, (or pretend to).</p>
