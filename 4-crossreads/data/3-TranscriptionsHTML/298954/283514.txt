<p>1917<br/>Sun. 26th Aug.<br/>The "Matunga" was emptied, all rubbish put into her holds, and at 11 am the two vessels put to sea.</p>
<p>In the muggy unventilated hospital we gasped with relief as we felt the sea-breezes again;   we shall never forget Affak Bay.    At abt 2.15 pm we stopped in the straits before Waigiouu &amp; the "Matunga" was bombed.</p>
<p>I pulled myself up to the port-hole and saw her just before she sank, but did not actually see her go under owing to a "spasm" coming on.</p>
<p>The old ship made noises like a crockery warehouse collapsing as she went down.   "Wolf" left then for Singapore.</p>
<p>Sat.  1st Sept.<br/>My "cure" took the drastic form complete starvation for 7 days, then condensed milk for a few more days.</p>
<p>Today the horses which were brought from the "Matunga" appeared for the first time and I dined sumptuously on roast horse and sauer-kraut, preceded by meat soup with <u>prunes</u> in it.</p>
