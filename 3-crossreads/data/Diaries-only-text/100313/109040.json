9/1/18 Bath Oxford
The afternoon continued dull and cold so remained by the fire until 3 o'c when settled up caught the Oxford train. Had a good journey to Didcot passing through pleasant country with odd old farmhouses and green thatched little villages nestled round the small church. The countryside differs from France in being so covered with hedges ? every little meadow is hedged or planted with trees. Some of the country hereabouts is heavily timbered by reason of these "hedges" c but still the cultivable land is not encroached upon. Changed at Didcot and had a quick run into Oxford to the Randolph Hotel per taxi. A very black night with cold whistling wind. After dinner sat by the Smoking Room fire and was edified (?) and amused by the conversation of 3 R.F.C subs ? "lardedah" foul and affected.
