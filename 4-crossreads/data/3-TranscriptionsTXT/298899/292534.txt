 Friday 2nd Nov  Italian breakout now total 120,000 prisoners &amp; 7000 guns, we are reported to be rushing help to them, they need it. Wrote a letter in the morning &amp; turned in at midday. At 4 P.M. I was awakened &amp; handed a letter from England &amp; shortly after two of our Sgts came for me to go on leave to Paris straight away. Great excitement. Packed my kit and hopped into the car and returned to my unit. After a snack went along to the Paymaster in the dark &amp; through the mud &amp; drew &pound; 9 all my book would allow. With a refund of &pound; 5 from my pal &amp; what I had this made &pound;18 available for the trip of 4 days so I felt safe. I then had a bath &amp; change of clothing, shaved &amp; sat down to patiently wait until time to go for the train. I obtained a signed order which stated that I was a day behind in going on the leave. A very anxious wait. Had no regrets on leaving the C.C.S. 
 3rd November  Trip to Paris in company with Sgt Hopkins.
