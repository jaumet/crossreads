  
 My word the fighting in France must be something awful at the present time, I think this must be the beginning of the end if we can only hold them, which we all think that thy can. 
 Well I think I will close for the present by sending you my very best love and Good Wishes. Take every Care of yourself. 
 I remain Yours loving W. Weaber 
 Kisses for you X X X X X X X X X X X
