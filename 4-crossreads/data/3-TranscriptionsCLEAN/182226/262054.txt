Feeling better today.
It gets very monotomous in this hole. We have to drill just for appearances sake & we are all heartly sick of it as the tucker is very scarce & extremely rough.
Stew & biscuits being about the most apertising dish we have served up to us & when there is not a sign of vegetable in the stew & the biscuits refuse to submit to mastrication till they have been thoroughly soaked you may guess it is no first class hotel out this way.
