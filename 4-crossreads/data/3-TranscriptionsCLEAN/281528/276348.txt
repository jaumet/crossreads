24/4/18 - LavievilleWaxman meantime fired his revolver but it jammed.  The Hun's superiority in every weapon costs us a price of human blood & life.  He then threw two bombs and the Huns ran - one screaming evidently wounded.  Barker was still conscious as Waxman pulled him to cover but soon died and W. dragged his body back to our lines.  At dawn I went outside of here and it was lying stiff on a stretcher with staring eyes.  I ordered the Roncers to cover it with a blanket.  At 4.30 a.m. the Hun opened a gas and shell bombardment and soon had us all sucking our gas tubes.
