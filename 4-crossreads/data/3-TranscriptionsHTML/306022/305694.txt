<p>Friday 22nd<br/>Very little done today and a general feeling of gloom on all. Most of the talk was about home and Australia.</p>
<p>Saturday 23rd<br/>Weather still good, getting a bit warmer. Nigger barber starts work, and most of us get our hair clipped, including officers</p>
<p>Sunday 24th<br/>Had a concert last night; it was pretty good for an impromptu affair. Church parade again otherwise, only rest, after strenuous week we have(n't)</p>
