the moon had entirely disappeared & a thick mist was hanging round, it was impossible to 10 yards ahead. We were afraid of losing our way so kept to the road where the mud was feet deep. At every step we sank up to our knees in mud & I can assure you that it was a very hard task carrying under such conditions, on arriving at the A.D.S. the perspiration poured out of me, I was completely done up. An officer told me that I looked about 55 years of age. The remainder of the night was a miserable one, we were all nearly frozen before morning, our feet were like blocks of ice.   3rd November.   Five men of another Ambulance working in conjunction with us were wounded to day, also one of our men were wounded seriously in the head. A great number of bearers have been sent away to the hospital, some of them very ill. At 4 p.m. our party 26 men, made for the 7th Post, to do the remainder of our 48 hours. About two miles to walk & a terrible walk it was too. Fritz sending shells all round us & we had some marvellous escapes. All will want a new outfit when we are out of this hellish place. I can see our Quarter Master having a fit. At 6 p.m. we were in a snug German dug-out, waiting for patients. We have over a mile to carry to the next Post, do not feel equal to the job, but I will do my best. At 8 p.m. two walking patients came along & I thought it would be better for me to take them along to the next relay post, as I did not feel strong enough to carry a stretcher. I shall never forget this night as long as I live. Not being on this post before
