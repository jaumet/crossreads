 1/9/15  "Scotian" Up at 6.  Sea at its best and very enjoyable after 3 months in desert.  Some seagulls about.  This route we are on is perhaps the oldest in the world and its tides have borne Phoenician galleys.  Perhaps the "dark ribbed ships" of the Iliad were past here in the days of Trojan wars. 'Twas from Lemnos the galleys returned "freighted with wine" &ndash; now this is our Base for Dardanelles.  At 11 am we pass land (Crete?) high and mountainous.  During the afternoon all officers met at a conference and decided to make a common stock of all belongings.  Those of any casualties to go to the "pool".  More land in sight later about 10 miles long with large town or village.  White houses perch on the heights here.  Troops slang: - "Imshi Yallah" a handy word.  Songs. They chant "Down where the water-melons grow!" to the tune of a well known Salvation army hymn about "living waters".
