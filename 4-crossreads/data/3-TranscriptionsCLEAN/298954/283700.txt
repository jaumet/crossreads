  
 Mon 25th Nov. I am ashamed to confess it, but as the "Kong Haakon" drew away from Hunland with the disconsolate 200 still seated in their 3rd class coaches, all I could spare for this dramatic leave-taking was a hasty glance through the saloon window before settling down to more Good Food.    Past the white chalk cliffs of Rugen & North across the Baltic - and I snoozed in the dainty little cabin.    Lunch was plain & perfect - delicious plain foods in any desired quantities. 
 A couple of unobtrusive notices warned us against overeating till our stomachs had become accustomed to Plentitude and Second Helpings.  Then I slept again - coming on dusk to find ourselves in the grey misty Cattegat approaching the entrance to Copenhagen - a destroyer (Danish) accompanying us to be "on the spot" if we bumped a mine, presumably.   In the misty sunset Copenhagen reminded me of Melbourne as seen from the river.
