Quite a number of the Red Cross goods we are using in the Hospital come from Lismore. Towels, pyjama, sheet, pillow slips and cushions and a number of writing tablets. Most of the pyjamas and the writing tablets have small slips pinned to them wishing the soldier luck who receives them a speedy recovery and requesting him to write to a given address.  Quite a   This is how I know they are from Lismore & District.They put large canvas baths on the deck at each side a few days ago. They are about 18 feet long by 8 feet broad. The men have great fun in them. I would like to tell you our whereabouts but as this is forbidden and as I have exhausted by stock of permissible news I will draw this scrawl to a close.Your loving sonEugene.
