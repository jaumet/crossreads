Went to bed very tired last night slept till about 1 am when I was awakened by the terrific cold, all of us only having one blanket coming straight from the Arabian Side of Egypt felt it more keenly than others.I dozed off again but could not sleep, so I will have to pinch some Bags or something to keep warmI had a royal breakfast this morning. A couple of us went to a Farm the French lady gave us 4 Eggs, 4 slices bread Butter 2 huge cups of coffee.My word it was a treat, after comparing the same articles with what we used to get in Egypt.
