2/11/17 Naples
A little rain this morning and an overcast sky. The Castel dell?Ovo spoils the outlook from my window across the Bay. Vesuvius this morning is dimly seen through mists and the slight winds have roughened a little the waters of the roadstead. Went about 10 a.m to the Museo Nationale and saw the Drunken Satyr, Farnese Bull, and many other masterpieces. Many of these have come from Herculaneum and Pompei those from the former have been turned black by the action of the lava and those from the latter have been turned green by the same agency. They also have many marvellously fresh paintings taken from the house walls and also some masterpieces of the middle ages. Admission was gained to a locked room where obscene but beautifully artistic articles and pictures are kept. The glass and earthenware of ancient buildings is preserved
