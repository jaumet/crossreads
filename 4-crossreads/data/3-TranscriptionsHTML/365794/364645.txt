<p>Saturday 30th [31] September [August] 1918<br/>Laurie R. &amp; Laddie Lawton called 3.30 p.m. for me, 4 p.m. Mardi first then Helouan, then San Govanni's for 4 p.m. tea, took snaps for these boys (Mothers).  Nile looks very fine with the water spreading &amp; boats floating far up as far as one can see both ways.<br/>The glorious old Nile!  One can well believe the saying, He who once drinks of the Nile waters will always come back again to Egypt!.  It is a year today since I entered T'mba for the last time!  When again will I return!</p>
