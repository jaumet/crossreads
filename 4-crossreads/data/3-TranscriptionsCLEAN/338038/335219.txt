The other lot of snaps of Anzac have been despatched some time ago.
Later 10.3.16  Have just quarter of an hour to lunch so will finish this off. No home mails arrived yet.
Things are settled now as regards postings in this Division. I am to remain as Adjutant of the 11th Bde, so I suppose it wont be long before you hve to address me "Captain T.W.G." The three Brigadiers in this Division are Majors Hughes, King & Rabett, with a commander for the Howitzer Bde still to be appointed.
Address me in   future until further notice .
