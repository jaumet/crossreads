  
 in Diameter place across the Deck & Mattresses underneath & the Boys each with a Pillow had to sit astride of the Pole & on a signal given had to hit one another until one fell of or around the Pole & then the other lad hat to beat him off to win, the Winner proved to be a burly Chap from our Batt & he kept his balance well, in fact his opponents made little impression when hitting him, he was to big & heavy to knock off. After Tea another Concert was held & enjoyed by all who attended. All hands amused themselves, one way & another until bed time. Lights out at 8.30 & all was quiet. 
 7/2/17. Wednesday Up again at 6 am, Weather Wet & Stormy in fact it was the worse
