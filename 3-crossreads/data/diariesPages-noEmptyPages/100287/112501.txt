he then proceeded to give us a good lecture ended up by remanding us for a D.C.M in Melbourne that's pretty stiff I reckon it's a pity that this has to take place right at the finish of our Military career for myself I don't care a rap but for my people I am sorry for they don't understand such things will no doubt think it a terrible disgrace etc etc, the privates he gave 20 days pay fine, if it comes to a case in Melbourne we will give them a go for it for we will get a good lawyer to defend us everyone on the ship reckons it is a thundering shame, of course we don't. I am very sorry that Bill May is missing, he may catch the train to Suez pick us up there.
