Hospitable, warmhearted and ingenuous, they remain. Every man is a horseman. The general and his officers have not assumed that rigid militarism, which is so obvious in France and so one finds more harmony, sympathy and kinship. No doubt of course this is produced by dissimilar conditions. Life here is more Australian, open air and expansive. There is not the strain of war nor the eternal fear of death. It would be a man's bad luck to be killed here in action, whilst in France he might consider himself fortunate to escape with life. France is hell, Palestine more or less a holiday. True, here they have arduous times, but they are neither longlived nor does the shadow of death eternally accompany them. The Australian in France has lost much of his charm, due to association and intermingling with society.
