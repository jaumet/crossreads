this one cant be hard on the poor lads  I suppose we are all more or less eager to get some letter etc from those near & dear. The mail never waits to be distributed nothing holds that back. and it is a great nuisance if it happens to come along at night over in the Peninsular I had to distribute it in an open space in the centre of the Camp and it was dangerous work sometimes we were quite exposed to Turkish Shells. I have often had them burst overhead right in the middle of sorting which was rather awkward. The trouble generally was that all hands would be talking at once and calling names and one could never hear the shells coming and consequently one never had any warning before they burst. The shells never seemed to bother the lads so long as they got their letters. Setting up Heliographs today for the first time a lot of the spare mirrors missing which happened when the panniers were conveyed across the water from ANZAC. the boys got among the Heliographs and practically denuded the instruments of mirrors they make beautiful mirrors being of the finest quality glass and very expensive.
