regarding the Pater. Who should I meet in London, the same day;  but brother Oscar, we had tea together, & off to a dance in the evening.  He is still the same old character. Spent the day at Mort Lake again on Tuesday, & then bid farewell to all at Palmers Road, as probably I will never see them again. If I do happen to come over to this side of the World again, I hope that it won't be in a troop-ship. Strolled round London on Wednesday, & met Eric who had just arrived from Fairlie in Scotland, and in the evening I attended another dance at the Irish Club.

Professor Spicer who delivered the Lecture, was a captive in Germany for four years. On Wednesday the 9th of April the A.M.C. party are moved to Fovant, which is about 7 miles from Salisbury. Inoculation against the "Flu" (for the second time took place the following day.  Two days afterwards I was down with the Flu, & sent to the hospital at Hurdcott.
