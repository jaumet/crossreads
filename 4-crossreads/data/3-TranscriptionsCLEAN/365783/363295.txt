I managed to hear that you were all well & that is the main thing. Thanks for sending me the Australasian Medical Gazette. I'm afraid I'll not get the letter you spoke to me about, there is no afternoon delivery here on Saturday, but it will probably be sent on & will be at Fremantle before we get there. Major Gray & I went to Sweet Nell of Old Drury last night   Nellie Stewart is still very good in the name part, but the rest of the company were quite second rate.The ship is very dirty just now but they have just finished coaling & it will not be long before the decks will be clean once more. Dont forget to call at Squires for
