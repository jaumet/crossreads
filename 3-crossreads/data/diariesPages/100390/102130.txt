I hope you got the few little things I sent for Xmas bone poor but well intended. 
Also the various photos at different times. 
Got a letter from Dora for which thank her. Also Bulletins Lone Hand up to date for which also thanks. Ive got a bad hand, poisoned wound but everyone here gets septic so that's nothing. These septic states are most stubborn last for weeks ?give one fits. I suppose 100percent of the men here have septic wounds sores. It's in the air the earth, the water. A beastly Arab cursed country. Must close now with love to all. A Happy New Year
Yours affectionately
Jack
