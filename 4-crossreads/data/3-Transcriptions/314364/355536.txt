<p>Mon. Jan. 13.<br/>My confrere, Riley, got word to go away today &amp; board the Boat. Very quick notice, too.  So she must be going soon. [indecipherable] the chap in the next Bed to me is on the same Boat. Sgt. [indecipherable] his Q.M. is married &amp; his wife lives in the village, so he gets Home every night. I wish I was so near to my wife as he is. Anyhow I will be soon, with a bit of Luck.<br/>Tues.14. The next Boat Roll should soon be out if she sails on the 20th. Gee I'm mighty anxious to see it. "Andy" the Q.M.'s assistant returned from Leave last night. I slept in his store between sheets. Some class. Bill Beard also came back last night. He tells me that he got engaged before leaving. It seems catching. There's a chap in my Hut "Taffy" Evans, who is going away on marriage Leave on the 28th. There won't be many single men in the AIF soon.<br/>Wed. Jan. 15th<br/>Another wet day. "Andy" &amp; I had a busy day sorting &amp; stacking washing. They put me on a new Job today making out the Tobacco List. We are able to buy Tobacco &amp; Cigarettes at "duty free" prices instead of having to pay 5 &frac12; d for a Packet of 10 Cigs we get em for 2 &frac12; d which is a mighty big difference in these days of cash shortage. Bert Berry is on the "Marga", so I'm hopng to see my name appear on the [indecipherable] Roll. Sgt Cropley (who is in charge of the Hospital) says this Roll is not coming out for another week or so. I really ought to write some letters but I'm hanged if I can settle down to the Job. I did manage to scribble a few lines to Mrs Sano &amp; asked her to send my Diary along.<br/>Thur.16. The sun is actually shining this morning &amp; it looks like being fine. Beautiful, Greasy stew for Breakfast again. Had a busy morning making out the Tobacco List &amp; collecting money for same. It's such a long time since I did any clerical work that I felt quite awkward.</p>
