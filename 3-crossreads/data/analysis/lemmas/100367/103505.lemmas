 She roll like a drunken man , and so do the boy on board . Walk in a decent way is imposs , and it becom an amus nuisanc to have to shift from one posit to anoth . Near all are down to it , both offic and men , and instead of the usual regiment activ and alacr of action , utter confus and chao reign .
