<p>Notes from diary of the late Private Roy Richards "D" Coy, 19th Batt, 5th Inf Brigade.</p>
<p>Sunday August 15th 1915  Left Heliopolis Camp about 8.30 p.m. and entrained for Alexandria, which we reached at about 4.30 a.m. Monday morning.</p>
<p>Monday 16th August 1915  Came on board "Saturnia" a rotten tub filthy and covered with coal dust.  Have mounted the guns on the after deck and the Section is on guard on lookout for Submarines.</p>
<p>Tuesday 17th August 1915  Still on guard on deck.  No excitement so far.  Lifebelt parade to-day.</p>
<p>Wednesday 18th August 1915  Same as yesterday.  Expect to reach Lemnos Island to-night.  Submarine guard doubled.  Saw Volcano at night.  The blue of meditteranean is remarkable.  Did not reach Lemnos.</p>
<p>Thursday 19th August 1915  At Lemnos.  The Harbour is filled with hundreds of Troopships and Battleships etc.</p>
<p>Friday 20th August 1915  Had a swim.  Are now on board "Osmaniet" which is a fine boat.  Very clean. Bound for the Dardanelles.  Time 6.30 leaving.</p>
<p>Saturday 21st August 1915  Arrived at Gaba Tebe at about 3 a.m.  Landing uneventful.  A few stray bullets, but no wounded.  An awful climb to the rear of trenches with the guns.  Am leaving to-night for the firing line.</p>
<p>Sunday 22nd August 1915  Am camped in dugouts just behind the line.  Great danger from flying bullets and shrapnel.  Several wounded.  Just leaving for the front.  Later:-  have had a rather gruelling experience.  Just up in a trench as reserves in the firing line.  Had to double across about 200 yds by shrapnel swept open land with the guns was no light job and am still absolutely knocked up.  Several killed and many wounded, including Mr. Killeen.</p>
<p>Monday 23rd August 1915  Still in trenches as reserves, but are moving still further along to-night.</p>
<p>Tuesday 24th August 1915  (Morning)  Orders came along last night cancelling and we are still in our dugout.  Very cold of a night and we have no coats or blankets.</p>
<p>Wednesday 25th August 1915  Still in the same place.  A party went back to base and brought all our overcoats.  Also went down to have a swim.  On guard to-night.</p>
<p>Thursday 25th August 1915  (Morning)  Still here.  Had another swim.  Moving further on to-night.</p>
