 I wish you could see me in my GAS MASK like a Teddy bear will send you a photo if possible - all ranks are issued with them. 
 Night march on SHELLAL infantry attack GAZA at dawn. 
 Arrived SHELLAL 5 A.M. My Squadron left Flank Guard. Good country - large quantity of cultivation Barley & Wheat - Grasses including all I gave before plus BARLEY & TIMOTHY Umbrella & Couch. Just been over to the 6th L.H. to see some old friends. They tell me they will meet me in the Hospital Clearing Station tomorrow - Cheerful.
