7/3/19 Marcinelle
Usual round of 22nd. c in the morning and after lunch went up to the fine Charleroi railway station where one gets a fine bath after dodging military police about. The tram system here is good and up to date and in a town as scattered as this proves of no small value. At BdeHQ we had an early mess and at 6 all hands went to the Cinema with little Andre the 7 year old kiddie of the people of the house. The pictures were splendid and the audience large as all the troops had taken their ladies to the show with them. Afterwards we had a supper of oysters and beer at the mess and then I found at my billet a chapter of history to edit for Gorman ? les Belges! After mess teased little Les Simone chez eux.
