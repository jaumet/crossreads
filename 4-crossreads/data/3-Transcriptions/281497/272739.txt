<p>23rd.  This morning Tom Scott &amp; myself went for a long walk along the sea shore, we followed it for 5 miles, skirting the low sandy hills most of the way, every here &amp; there we came across the remains of old boats that had been driven ashore by the fierce storms that sometimes sweep over the North Sea" in winter time we finished up at the ruins of what had, at one time been a beautiful summer residence, about 5 storeys high &amp; fitted with lifts" &amp; all the modern conveniences but the sea had smashed</p>
