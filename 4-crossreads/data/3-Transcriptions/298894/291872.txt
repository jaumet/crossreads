<p>II. Ours is No 1. tent &amp; full of decent lads.<br/>    Each one just a soldier with individual fads<br/>Herbert is the captain &amp; sings a decent song<br/>He's made himself quite popular<br/>Though we haven't known him long.<br/>He's pretty good at tennis, in church he has some rank<br/>and serves the mess as treasurer, as experienced in the bank.</p>
<p>III. Greenwell is his neighbour, his place he proudly fills<br/>He's got a troubled stomach, so we designate him pills.<br/>He turns in pretty early &amp; isn't long awake.<br/>He'll pass his time most pleasantly if sitting near a cake.</p>
<p>IV. Then we have Young Jonesy, a lad who's here to learn.<br/>He wants to get a cross or two then safely return.<br/>There's not much doubt about him, he's willing and<br/> he's bright.<br/>We'll one &amp; all stand by him &amp; help him in<br/>his fight.</p>
<p>V. Brother Andrews &ndash; Padre bears a double Cross<br/>The red one on his arm &amp; the other &ndash; Life's great loss.<br/>Today he's just a soldier with a dollar clear a day<br/>But his precept &amp; example preaches more than he could say</p>
<p>VI. Gissing is our tallest mate a chemist &amp; a sport<br/>Possessor of a camera (which hasn't yet been caught)<br/>There's no nonsense about him though above us all he towers<br/>He tells us that in sleep he likes to spend his full eight hours.</p>
<p>VII. Bingham is our baby &amp; causes lots of mirth<br/>If he hasn't any funny jokes he'll promptly<br/>give one birth.</p>
