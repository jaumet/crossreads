so odd.  All the tram conductors & drivers wear khaki suits & look very neat & cool.  By jove, this is a lovely Hotel.  I suppose the Metropole & the Australia are as good in Sydney, but of course we would not care to stay in those places in Sydney, they hit you up too much.  We had a 4 course breakfast & had a nice French waitress to attend us.  We all threw in 6d. & tipped her.  Well, we must run up the town & buy some things as we have to catch the 11 a.m. train back to Fremantle.
Remember me to Mrs. Park & the Girls & Mr. & Mrs. Allison & Stephen & assuring you, that we are having as we said we should have, a picnic, I will wind up.  We may take the motor to Perth it is so much nicer & more to see.  We will make up a party.
Much Love to allFrom Harry x
