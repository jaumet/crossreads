<p>July Tuesday  11th Sailly<br/>Here we are in another town three miles nearer the firing line. This place is very near the front &amp; could very easily be shelled, but it seems that the reason why it is not, is that on the other side of the lines, the Germans have a similar town, which they use for billeting troops, &amp; if they shelled our place, we would shell theirs.<br/>The Germans once had this place, &amp; on their big retreat they destroyed the bridge over the river. There is a very fine church here with a square tower, &amp; I am told, that to cover their retreat, the Germans mounted machine guns on this tower, &amp; were so strong that is was necessary to burn them out. We had a good display of bursting shells yesterday evening, &amp; bombing of airoplanes.<br/>Thursday 13. 7. 16 Trenches<br/>We are now in the trenches, entered Tuesday, &amp; were so fortunate, as to not having any casualties. I am on the phone here. This morning I spent a couple of hours in the front trenches, had a look over the top at the German trenches which are about 200 yds away. Every body there appears to be well contented. The night we arrived we had shells bursting</p>
