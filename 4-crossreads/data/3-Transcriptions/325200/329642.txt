<p>This meant watering (about &frac34; mile) then in two lots, one after another  &amp;  with other camp duties quite a full days work.<br/>I have the tent to myself tonight. JHK. has gone down for 24 hours to the Vet Corps to look after 6 of our horses these.  D.M. is in charge of the picket. The rest are at Alex. Very nice  &amp;  quiet.<br/>I go to Alex. on the 13th the day after tomorrow. I don't anticipate a wildly amusing time but it should turn out better than Port Said.</p>
