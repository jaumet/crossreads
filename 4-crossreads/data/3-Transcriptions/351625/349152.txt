<p>For ever with the Lord</p>
<p>"For ever with the Lord!"<br/>Amen; so let it be;<br/>Life from the dead is in that word,<br/>'Tis immortality.<br/>Here in the body pent,<br/>Absent from Him I roam,<br/>Yet nightly pitch my moving tent<br/>A day's march nearer home.</p>
<p>"For ever with the Lord!"<br/>Father, if 'tis Thy Will,<br/>The promise of that faithful word<br/>Even here to me fulfil.<br/>Be thou at my right hand,<br/>Then can I never fail;<br/>Uphold Thou me, and I shall stand,<br/>Fight, and I must prevail.</p>
<p>So when my latest breath<br/>Shall rend the veil in twain,<br/>By death I shall escape from death<br/>And life eternal gain.<br/>Knowing as I am known,<br/>How shall I love that word<br/>And oft repeat before the throne,<br/>"For ever with the Lordo"</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
