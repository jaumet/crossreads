 that we were both &quot;fed up.&quot; 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; It was not long before we were walking back together in the direction in which my (temporary) home lay, swapping the news from home and telling each other that we had been living for this moment for many months past, and it was then too, that I learned of my good fortune in finding Les, for he had almost started in search of Albert and myself on that same Sunday, I think the date was August 11th. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; We got a quiet room in an Estaminet, and had a meal together, comparing photographs from home; photographs taken by our two selves while abroad; we compared news of friends from home, of our special interests, we told of leave, of our work and our stunts.&nbsp; Old Les appears to be very well though a trifle thinner; he is like all of us &quot;fed up&quot; and wishes the war well over; he has a jolly good job and an important one too, and I hope soon to hear of his promotion for one of his assistants is an N.C.O. and Les should have rank. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it is nearly time for Lights Out, so I&#39;ll have to finish; speaking of Lights Out reminds me that after leaving Les at about 8 o&#39;clock I walked, rode, walked rode and walked arriving at camp at about 11 o&#39;clock, going into the tent Capt.Treb. wakened, I whistled Lights Out and then assured him that I was in the tent before it blew, so that was all right. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Well with every good wish, 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harold.
