We chew sand at each meal and when I was at the school of Signalling I went to a dentist in Cairo and it cost me &pound; 2/10 to get my teeth repaired in consequence of so much sand- I suppose I shall be busy here surveying the whole outpost line the Brigadier and all Commanding Officers were out this morning viewing the positions for outposts to be placed. A Bedouin arab was brought into camp this morning by some of our patrols but I believe he is one of our intelligence branch of which we have quite a number who get periodically "Captured".
