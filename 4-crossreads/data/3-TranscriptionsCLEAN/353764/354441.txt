to-day was feeling very queer & had severe pains in the Head.  I also began to get feverish & perspired profusely, so late last night I went to the Hospital & was treated by a friend of Uncle Charlies.  He asked me if I had ever had Malaria Fever & said that he thought I had a mild form if it, but that I was to report back again if I felt worse.He gave me some Cooling Powders to take during the night & they have done me the world of good.  You will no doubt rouse when you hear this as I do not intend to tell you of it, as it would only worry you.
This morning one of the latest Aeroplanes flew just over the top of our tents & we had a fine view of it. They are a very large type of Machine & also particularly powerful.I was offered a Warrant Officers job in the Supply at Serapeum to-day & refused it, as I don't want to go there until I have to, more over it is a clerical job & I would much rather be with the men.  In any case I have been promised a Warrant in the Transport in a few weeks time, which will suit my books much better.
