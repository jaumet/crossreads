<p>Lemnos I went into the 1st Australian Field Hospital at Mudros Village.  I stayed here till the 4th October.  I was then sent to the 4th Clearance Hospital inland about a mile.  Whilst there I went for a walk on the hills close by, on which the Turks &amp; Greeks had some heavy fighting during the Balkan War 6 years ago.  The remains of barricades and trenches were plentiful, but I was unable to secure a cartridge case as a memento.  However, I secured some coloured stones, rather than come away empty handed.  After a fortnight I went on board the transport &amp; Hospital Ship "Acquitania" and sailed for England at 7 a.m. on October 21st.</p>
