 It was in 1911 that we landed in Honolulu  despite the warnings of the Captain that we could not return to the ship as there was an outbreak of cholera. Fortunately, we managed to get accommodation at Cottage Grove, right in the midst of the nursing staff, but things were quiet and we came to the conclusion we might yet end up washing dishes at the Alexander Younge Hotel. Following the day of our arrival we called on several Drs. who gave us a very nice reception but little encouragement. However, within two days I was called up and asked if 1 would go to the cholera settlement, to which I agreed. There were few patients and little we could do for them but keep them clean and push fluids - the poor things died very quickly. I had asked the Superintendent at Kalihui detention camp for a night nurse and one was supplied immediately, so we were able to look after the many contacts who were kept apart. Strict hygiene was observed - hands washed before meals- all drinking water boiled - vegetables cooked and only fruit with peel was allowed. The native's bread "poi" was kept in separate dishes and not left in the bowls in which fingers were washed. We stayed three months, delivering babies and doing general nursing. We got to know the Hawaians well and liked them. We saw some of the native dancers, were probably shocked but did not show it. Today we would not turn a hair. They were a very happy people who gave us much pleasure. On return to Honolulu there was plenty of nursing to be had and in between cases we toured the different islands. Went to Molokai and, at a distance, talked with Father Damien and Brother Joseph Dutton. It was the latters Silver Jubilee 1886-1911. What wonderful men they were and I was glad when Robert L. Stevenson wrote letters giving them full credit for the work they were doing for the lepers. At the same time in Honolulu there was cruel gossip going around regarding their morals. Also visited the famous volcano of Kilauea on Hawaii. It was quite a trip to get to Volcano House. Firstly by boat, automobile and lastly a donkey. This was 1912. One would expect a volcano to be situated on top of a mountain, but Kilauea is about 3000ft above sea level and you look down into the boiling fire. A spectacular sight and well worth a trip. It was early in 1913 when Elizabeth Hunt and myself decided to go to Vancouver. She was an Australian nurse and had a small private hospital in Honolulu. We booked on the "Niagara" in March, which was her first voyage. Had a great send off with leis, streamers and the native band playing ''Oloho Oi", as they do when all ships leave the mainland. We felt sad leaving the Happy Islands.
