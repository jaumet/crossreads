 Monday 24 December1917 Busy for Xmas day &ndash; "Connaught" scheme is red shades, plants &amp; flowers, very effective though &amp; strangely enough, the pts. in their blue suits &amp; the white ward &amp; quilts carry out the "Red, White &amp; Blue" well.  Off duty 2-5, town &amp; shopped, without doing much, then duty &amp; shook hands with L.  Allenby  Wingate &amp; rec'd gracious word &amp; a card from them both.  C.G. very nice &amp; very scotch. I find only 12 men to cook for 1500 pts. C of E Padre is coldly friendly like the rest. Absence of home &amp; love &amp; weighing very heavily these days.
