Dardenelles, don't they? I daresay we shall go straight there, & not land at Egypt at all, or any how only for a few days to get all equipment etc in order. Does Dene know when he will be leaving? I dropped into Tom's Office yesterday to see him, and he fairly gasped when he saw me. We had a bit of a yarn but I had scaled away from the Barracks to see him so I could not stop long.
It has been decided to move this camp to Seymour, some 50 miles further away, on account of the complaints made against it by the public. They have just had about 2 weeks rain here & the place is worse than a pig sty, but I suppose you have read about it in the papers. Still you had better address my letters to Broadmeadows & they will forward them on to Seymour if we have left.
Well, Mother, write by return post if you can, as I am tired of cadging smokes and if I have asked too many questions tell Hazel to answer some of them. By the way I did not even know she had undergone an operation, but am very very glad to hear she is right again.
With lots of Love to you allYour SonAlan
If you know what boat Uncle Jim is leaving by, let me know, & any way tell me what crowd he is with.
