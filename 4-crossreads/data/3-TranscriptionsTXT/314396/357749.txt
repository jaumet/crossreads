quickly got out. The water boat came up alongside on the port side &  it was the fun of the world watching them. They are manned wholly by niggers &  they couldn't tie up. One of the boats broke away &  the tug had to pull it up again. Took them nearly all the morning to get them fixed. Our boys threw down money to them & they would let the ropes go &  grab for the money.The English cruiser "Yarmouth" came in this morning. The water boat men are real funny. Two of our boys went ashore &  I ordered 6 silk handkerchiefs  &  a field manual of Engrs. The German prisoners from the Emden. 45 men 2 warrant officers, 2 Officers &  the captain also a nephew of the Kaiser's were the total strength of the prisoners. They came onboa aboard &  the guard fixed bayonets &  charged their rifles in front of the prisoners. They were put in the after end &  they were stripped &  all their clothing examined.  Some had on their caps SMS Emden, others 4II Torpedo Division. &  Scheiff Artillerie Scharez warz. The name of the nephew is Count Prince Franz Joseph of Hohenzollern. Nothing much else only watching the boats coming back with our men. We took on tea, &  marrows.
Tuesday 17th. Nov 1914.At 12.30 was awaked by the Kidlets here. The YMCA man had only just got back then bringing oranges, cocoanuts, &  bananas. The boys bought &  we ate. Got up at 1/4 to 7 &  felt very tired. It is real hot here in the daytime &  cool in the morning &  night.
