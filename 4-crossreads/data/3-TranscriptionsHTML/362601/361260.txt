<p>1 September, Monday</p>
<p>Engaged at Walter Watrons.</p>
<p>We have a nice time &amp; music. I miss train but arrive at Tiksdale in time for telling of fortune.</p>
<p>2 September, Tuesday</p>
<p>Go to Town with B &amp; Hanna. I go Home to House of Girl. I nearly knock down on the wharf with Ellis &amp; Etta. We go to flat &amp; lay linos. Terrific thunderstorms &amp; a water sprout off the Heads.</p>
