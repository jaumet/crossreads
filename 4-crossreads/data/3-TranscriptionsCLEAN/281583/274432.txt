have been of them & many incidents have come to my memory of the last days in Australia & I am wondering if I will be home for the next one. I have been day dreaming most of the day only coming out of my reveries when the hiss of a shell passing over would send ones heart into ones mouth.
The intense cold is playing up with us all & I can assure you that the hardships are both great & numerous. I have given up washing &  shaving as one suffers for too many hour after each time. The ice this morning averaged 9 to 12 inches thick it is still laying on the ground. Needless to say my chilblains are very sore.
There was the finest display of Aeroplanes to-day that I have ever seen. I counted as many as 40 planes in one place. There were many duels & we saw one fall from a great height. Another one fell on the top of a hill which the Germans could see & not one of us was game to go & have a look at it, as Fritz was putting in shell after shell in an endeavour to smash it up before night fell. It is a prize worth going for as the pilots & observers always have beautiful coats on, made of long fur. Several of our boys have already booked some.
Fritz has been putting over a few occasional shots. He pestered the very life out of us
