<p>[The beginning of this letter appears to be missing.]<br/>bonza season you are having.</p>
<p>I'm very glad to hear all this but its most aggravating, why could it not happen when I was home.</p>
<p>I was dying to see Gum Creek running &amp; I <u>know</u> it won't run this year even if I am back by then although that is doubtful.</p>
<p>We are off again tomorrow back to the line again.  I don't mind much but I hate the moving part.  We have been 4&frac12; weeks out &amp; it has been a good rest for the nerves anyhow if nothing else.</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you lots of things but they will all have to wait for a while.  It is most aggannoying.</p>
<p>I am doing well with my French, can actually make myself understood although my speech is very halting.</p>
<p>Are you at Manly this year.  Is it true Margaret Johnson is engaged.  Alas for my blighted hopes.</p>
<p>Shall you be displeased if I bring back</p>
