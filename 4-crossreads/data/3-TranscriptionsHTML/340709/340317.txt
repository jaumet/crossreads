It was estimated that we should break through the reef a little after midday. This proved to be true; we passed through Cook's Passage at about 2 o'clock &amp; like the schooner "Hesperus" steered for the open sea. Cook's Passage gets its name from the fact that Capt Cook in the year 1770 went through the Barrier at that point. It is very narrow and the fairly lumpy sea knocked up by the South-easter broke heavily on the coral rocks. On either side is a shallow lagoon whose multi-coloured waters are supplied by the trade wind, though they look remarkably tranquil as compared with the foaming swell of the Pacific. It was a grand sight to see the submarines surging ahead &amp; dipping their horns continuously into the dark green seas. Many times the conning towers were drenched with spray, &amp; one could not help feeling rather sorry for the crew huddled together on that small circular platform. I have now to record a most lamentable thing. For the second time in my life I experienced the miseries of Mal-de-Mer. I can give no reason for it, the "Berrima" being a very steady ship. Nevertheless, it was so; &amp; I reminded myself of a picture I had once seen of a woman lying helpless on the deck of a steamer with a man's head in her lap, the owner of the said head being also a victim to the dread malady.
