There are, to be sure, other places also, but both accomodation and character are very often questionable, and none of them compare with the "Nash". Directly the parade was over this morning, the remark was passed, "Oh well, there are always the brothels." Rough as the exclamation was, it contained a world of grim truth. There are always the Brothels and there are temptations enough for the average soldier to spend his time on leave there, without the authorities, in their intolerable exclusiveness, barring him access to the best place at his disposal.

This too, in that most erroneously styled "democratic" army of Australia. Of course, we know that things like the above are the work result of decisions of the English "heads", and are disliked accordingly.
