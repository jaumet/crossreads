<p>officers presumably to make a reconnaissance towards Rafa which latter place by the way is our future objective and I am thinking that it will not be so much of a walk-over as the Maghdaba Stunt this is in their direct line of retirement and those 4 centimeter guns are along this route somewhere. The remainder of the Brigade remains here as a sort of reserve to the strong detachment which has gone forward on the reconnaissance. We go back to El Arish tomorrow sometime. The weather looks showery and we can fully expect plenty of "Mooya" [Arabic for water] during the night. I have one blanket and a rubberized rain-proof coat so I have a chance of being dry. Most of the boys have one blanket and their cloak. Have collected a good quantity of firewood and have a good fire burning.</p>
<p>31st December 1916 El Arish Sunday<br/>Good bye for Ever good old 1916.<br/>Shades of Hades! What a night I had!<br/>The weather was threatening all night and cloudy and there was occasional misty rain and I only had one blanket which [being carried under the saddle was damp beforehand] and my rain-proof coat and the sand was very wet So the only thing to do under the Circs was to ly down on the cold</p>
