  
 We left this billet on the 17th Nov 1917 and marched to Gambercourt, about 6 miles stayed here the night. On the 18th 1917 we left again about 8 in the morning, reaching Tortefontaine about 1.30 in the afternoon A fine pretty little town! 
 We stayed all next day, we had a day's spell to relieve the monotony of route marching. We left Tortefontaine on the 20th Nov 1917, and reached Fontaine-S. Mayne about three hours after. We passed through several very interesting little villages on our way to Fontaine-S. May 
 On 21st Nov 1917 we left again, per boot, reaching Hautevilliers a little after On 22nd Mov. 1917 we left Hautevillies and on our march crossed a part of the beautiful Somme canal! We reached Franleu the same day 
 On 23rd Nov 1917 we left Franleu and arrived at our final resting place Mezieles about 2 in the afternoon. This is where, we were supposed to have 100 days spell, but it proved to be a myth.
