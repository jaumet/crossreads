28/10/17 Mt. Cenis
Mt. Cenis tunnel customs officials went through our baggage. The country now becomes very rugged we are travelling among high snow clad mountains with clouds scudding low past. There is thick snow everywhere but coming down a valley we seem to run out of it. The ground from now on was free from snow and we ran into a very precipitous gorge Le Sorgie where there were great views and narrow winding roads. Had lunch in the dining car and then ran into Turin. The people here hang their washing out on the balconies and it quite spoils the look of the houses. Even now one can notice an untidiness that you do not see with the French. The water power seems to be fully utilised and there are electric light standards everywhere. Found at Turin that we had a wait of 4 hours so went up the street for a look round. The streets are straight and wide
