<p>31 May 1915<br/>Monday (annotated 47) 32 wks from home.</p>
<p>Nothing happened last night they evidently want a little time to reorganize their forces.  News came to hand that Bert Masters &amp; the boys were to return to us today &amp; I &amp; a party were sent down to the Cove to meet them, I got just half way when I ran into them, we then had a swim, Tepe opened up &amp; got Norm a beauty in the back, I carried him to the dressing station &amp; got him fixed up he's goes aboard the hospital boat tonight, News to hand that Italy is at grips with Austria already &amp; we have got two of their submarines &amp; should have had the third only the tracker misunderstood the order to fire, one was rammed &amp; the other was hemmed in, they then found it in one bay &amp; are cruising round after it now we were to attack with the bayonet opposite Quinns but it was counter ordered &amp; then things have to be thought of; NZealanders have taken over all of the L Horse posts today &amp; it is rumoured that the Sig Section is coming to help us also. Go on duty at 10.30 PM again</p>

<p>A little fun last night but nothing much only a little shrapnel as usual, another spy caught he was gunner on No 3 howitzer &amp; was responsible for premature bursts he is charged with disobedience of orders, given range 700 3 &amp; he was firing at 550 .2 so he is up against it [indecipherable] arrived back today from the [indecipherable]; 4th Inf  Bde has been relieved by NZ's &amp; can see trouble ahead for the Sigs.  Another army corps has disembarked at Helsham so more jobs for the troop.  Snipers gain busy &amp; shot one man through the thigh &amp; severed the artery.  Downing who happened to be present put the digigital pressure on the leg &amp; saved the chaps life.  Aeroplanes round again but nothing doing at all.  went for a swim &amp; am still enjoying it even without shrapnel.  Field bakery has been fixed up at Tenedos &amp; bread is due in a day or two, Ammunition arrives by the boat load all calibres &amp; both shrapnel &amp; lyddite, sent for tarp but no luck</p>
