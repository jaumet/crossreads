<p>fine today, put the morning in on Battalion drill, am going on Guard tonight.<br/>Got a letter today from Aunt Carrie the first one for a long time.<br/>Carswell &amp; I have put most of the afternoon in printing &amp; we have got some good results from a new mixture we are using.<br/>2nd. On Guard today but things are very quiet, with the exception of a madman whom I am looking after he is in the clink for his own safety, tomorrow they are sending him to an asylum. I have another peculiar case too an ex Sergt. he is a bad egg but has a good little wife, every day she comes &amp; see's him. &amp; the Sergt of the Guard lets them go into a little room for privacy's sake</p>
