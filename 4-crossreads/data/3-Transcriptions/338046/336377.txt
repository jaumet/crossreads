<p>1916<br/>Aug. 24<br/>On 24th August 1916, I got leave from the office (State Brick Works) to enlist, and enlisted with the A.I.F. for general service.   I was to go into camp in a fortnights time but got an extension of another fortnight.<br/>Sept 27  On 27 September I reported at Victoria Barracks with about forty others including Sol Green and Herman, who had previously tried to get into the Artillery on the same day as myself.<br/>We lined up and had our names called.  As we were about to move off someone stopped us as there was another man joining us.   He had just enlisted and was going straight into camp.    Some ladies on the Barrack Square provided us with a meat pie and a cup of tea each.   Then we were marched to the Showground.   On entering the gates we were greeted with "You'll miss your mother", "You'll be sorry" etc from "old soldiers" of about two days standing.   This was the regular practice and we were ready the following day to greet the next batch</p>
