<p>9-4-17<br/>Mon 9th<br/>Enemy planes very active again this morning coming over us a couple of times followed by a ring of smoke from bursting shells. Had a parade this morning to clean saddlery; Gen Chauvel came past today but did not call; There appears to be nothing doing at Gaza at present, a big supply of gas helmets were sent up some time ago &amp; we believe we are going to use gas shells I received a parcel from Jessie today Snakes are rather plentiful here, Lindsay Rich killed one last night in the moonlight &amp; we saw several during the last day or two</p>
