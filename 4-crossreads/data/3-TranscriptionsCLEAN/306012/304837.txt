  
 This afternoon I went up to the left sector Adv. Dressing Stn. that C Section is running at Wyschaete - two kiloms. closer to the line.  The A.D.S. is a collection of strongly cemented pillboxes and is quite a decent little "home".  The camouflage screens in front give it quite a village inn appearance.  On the left of the road going up there is a great exploded mine crater evidenty sent off when the 3rd Div. & N.Zs. took Messines & Wyschaete.  Several notices show the positions of unexploded mines surrounded by wire fences.  The country, of course, presents a desolate appearance with plenty of shellholes & a few shattered treestumps.  To-day has been sunny & clear and increased aerial activity was noticeable.  Several of our big guns were busy pounding away at Fritz.
