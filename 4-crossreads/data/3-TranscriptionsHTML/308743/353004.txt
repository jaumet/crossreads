<p>The Turks made a few feeble attacks during the night evidently feeling as to our strength &amp; down the right it was a little heavier perhaps. Our howitzers made splendid practice during the night &amp; probably they did much to subdue the Turks. Hal, Bert &amp; I had a narrow squeak from a HE at the batteries possy a 4.5 from Silent Peter came along &amp; burst at our feet but beyond bursting &amp; smothering us in dirt no damage was done only we got burnt in digging for relics. The beach was shelled from all quarters today &amp; so were our positions with both large &amp; small stuff. Bert B &amp; I went out tonight to hunt for caps got 2 &amp; a live shell for the boys to play with. Hal went for a shoot had a little excitement at a Turk observing with a periscope at the Razor &ndash; Boss very crook. OK</p>

<p>The long looked for attack didnt come back last night only at 12 they livened things up a little but only for a time though. Our 5" howitzers were busy all night &amp; had some bonza bursts. Had our usual today &amp; then went up to 701 &amp; watched two Monitors shelling the rear of Achi Baba one was confining her attention to the roads along which troops could be seen moving &amp; the other to [indecipherable] the Turks. at 3 this afternoon on the Northern end of our position at Helles the Turks made a rush at the trenches but although they employed plenty if bombs they only succeeded in getting near the trenches &amp; wounding 2 officers &amp; 28 men while we can count 50 of their dead outside the trenches. I met Cyril O who is OK down at the beach. Went out hunting for caps &amp; were spotted by the Turks who promply gave us a fusillade but luckily no one hit. The Caldwell guns are doing great work at Steeles &amp; their 1000 rds per run are sure to command attention from Turky</p>
