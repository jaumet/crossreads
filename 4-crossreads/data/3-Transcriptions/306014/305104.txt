<p>Having completed the more elementary part of our training, we entered the "Bull Ring" today. In this we are trained in the various drills which are of immediate value at the front and spend an hour on each subject, a change of work taking place at each "smoko". In the morning we had our usual hours march, then did a little "Company Drill" for an hour and then bayonet fighting for the same time.
