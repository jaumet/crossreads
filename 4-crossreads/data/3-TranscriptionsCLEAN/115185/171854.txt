  
 I long for news of you all. I hope Father is well. Much love to him & you my precious Mother. I feel I'm having most wonderful work to do and feel it a most solemn honour to be allowed to do it. Love to Cousin Lily. Mrs Fiaschi is staying in Alexandria. I don't think the War office will let her go on she expects in September but we have to leave a nurse behind with her don't tell anyone, but it will all leak out I suppose later - but its better not to come from me. I got a helmet today for 4/6 we are to wear them. Father will be glad my head is protected. The sun is very strong. I have sent P.C's to the girls & Gibson today, also to Con & Bill. I hope they & their families are well. I have the Psalms & St John in Modern Readers Bible. I got them at Mudres - been great comfort to me
