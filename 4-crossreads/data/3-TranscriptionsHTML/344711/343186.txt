<p>22nd<br/>Reveille 7.30.  After breakfast watched a sale of 250 donkeys held inside the barrack square.  It was the greatest character of a sight I ever saw.  The men who were responsible for keeping the donkeys in line used their sticks freely, both on the donkeys and their owners.  A real good donkey is worth about &pound;6, but, of course, prices vary.  As it turned out afterwards, these donkeys were bought for a special purpose and were used at the Dardanelles.  They were landed in one place, &amp; the Turks, thinking they were troops hurried up re-inforcements, and turned shrapnel on them.  In the meantime, our men had effected an unexpected landing in another place, and taken the Turks unprepared for them.  The donkeys were nearly all wiped out, but they had served their purpose.  It was rather rough on the donks, but war is war.</p>
<p>In afternoon rambled about the lovely Gizeh gardens where are lovely flowers and green grass.  Very enjoyable after Ma'adi.</p>
