 " Blue Nobbi " Aug 13 My Dear Mother I write hard know what to write about life up here is pretti near the same . Of cours we are again in the boom we were pleas to hear from S.B Co that our collect of skin are at present not worth anyth they will be offer again in the summer . which mean of cours that we have got to stay here till then . I do n't like the thought of this , to chase wallabi with everi chanc of their hide be worth noth doe not appeal to me , all the shooter are of cours in the same boat , so to speak . Perhap H.W.P. may be abl to give some advic as to what broker think on the question as to whether fur skin will improv in valu in the summer or not . I do n't see how they can myself . I can readili understand as point out in the onli paper I have seen that thing such as food stuff will go up like one thing as soon as trade is reorgan and safe , fur skin have rather too much arsenic about them to be regard in the line of food . The paper make my hair curl , I have onli seen one the absenc of news is tortur . I can not help think what may have happen or be happen up in the north , where so mani thing have taken place .
