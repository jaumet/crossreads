<p>by which the wounded could be taked from the very door of the dressing</p>
<p>station back behind the lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both before and since I have seen a good deal of ruin but</p>
<p>nothing to compare with Ovillers and La Boisselle which are more</p>
<p>utterly destroyed that any other villages in this battle area.</p>
<p>I passed through Ovillers towards the crest of the hill (it was</p>
<p>impossible to tell when you had left the fillage any more that when</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About midday on the day following the night of our arrival</p>
<p>we were moved up in support trenches for us to occupy, so we</p>
<p>scattered ourselves amongst the shell holes in a field just to the</p>
<p>left and bordering on Contalmaison.&nbsp; The field was in a bit of a</p>
<p>gully up which all troops going to that part of the line had to move</p>
