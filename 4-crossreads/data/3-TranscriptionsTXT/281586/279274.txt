 "Goodbye Australia" S.S. Mongolia  July 9th  1916. I Thy bold outlines growing dimmer, in the sunset's golden glimmer Jutting headland, rocky slope and winding bay And the troops are gathered forward, with strained eyes gazing shoreward, Just to catch the last glimpse fading with the day. 
 2 For a passionate devotion, strong and boundless as the ocean, For a Home of  Homelands, glorious and Free With a solemn strange insistence, as we swing out in the distance Thrills our hearts anew with sacred love to thee. 
 3 All the tender ties that bind us. All the memories that remind us Of thy Shores, thy sun kissed lands, thy beauty rare Every golden recollection, stirring chords of deep affection Builds anew the heart's High Throne, and sets thee there.
