 Friday 2nd November 1917 
 Breakfast in bed!! &amp; wrote letters &ndash; lunched in Regent Street &amp; got Circular Notes for journey. Visited No. 6 Aust. Auxiliary Hospital &amp; Mrs. Crawford a sister of Katies &ndash; then Sports Club to write letters. 
 Rang up MARDI who could not come to tea today, but hope to see her tomorrow. 
 My Bronchial trouble still worries me but Egypt will do it good &ndash; all fog &amp; mist &amp; rain here. 
 Saw Mardi in evening, as pretty as ever.
