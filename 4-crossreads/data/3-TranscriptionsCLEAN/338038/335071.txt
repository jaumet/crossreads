 My dear Father, Many thanks for your long letter of the 6th Feb. I trust mine are turning up regularly now. I see no reason for their not doing so as I am usually careful not to give any information of "strategical importance to the enemy" so there should be no fear of them censored. Your apparent difficulty owing to scarcity of news seems to have been more successfully coped with than the similar position in which I find myself at the present time. I too must fall back on the weather. To sum it up it is "damn hot", at the same time we get occasional cool spells of two or three days as at present, which bucks us up considerably. I duly received D'Arcys letter and was very glad to hear all his people were well. I sent him a post I.
