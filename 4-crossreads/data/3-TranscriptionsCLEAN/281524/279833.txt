  
 7/10/17 Hannebeke Wood & Front Line of 100 details from Caestre seems to be our only hope. At 5 p.m. started to move up and had a nightmare of a journey over the mud. When we reached [indecipherable]  the S.O.S  went up all along the line and heavy shelling started. Shells started bursting thick and we rushed for the nearest pill box which happened to be De Knoet farm. Crouched in against the back we had a little refuge. I was struck by a piece of stone on the shoulder and at first thought of a wound. Some of the others were wounded. Ducked into the place and took shelter there for a while. A rough walk up to BattnHQ. Just at the entrance a shell burst and I saw someone being pulled out and put on the parapet. Smothered in mud from head to foot we staggered inside dreadful looking people. This promises to be a second Flers. The relief dragged on hour by hour and it was indeed a crucifixion of the flesh for the poor tired out fellows. Some were nearly crying. For those who did not turn up from Ypres there is no contempt too deep.
