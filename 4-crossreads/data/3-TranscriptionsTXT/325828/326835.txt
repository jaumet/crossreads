Please thank Anna for her note to hand to-night.  Am enclosing stamps as requested & tell her she can have the post-cards if she wishes.  Leo.
My dearest Father,I must thank you for your letter of 24th to hand yesterday.In a short note to Walter last week I told him that I had finally decided to go to the front & do my share.  I expect to be down leaving here next Monday week (7th prox) providing the Dr. passes me alright this end.The leg is nearly healed now but there is an angry looking swelling about an inch below the wound.  To-night it is about the size of a pigeon's egg.  I am keeping it poulticed & it is owing to the awkward position I am in (that of lying up with a poultice on) that my writing is all skewiff.  I am going in to Dr Alan Walker (an old S.H.S. boy) on Saturday to see if I'll pass for pig-sticking, & if the boil affair hasn't broken then I will get him to lance it for me.We expect to finish sowing on SaturdayExcuse the brevity of the note for I am anxious to get to bed & rest the legLove to all,from Your loving son     Leo
