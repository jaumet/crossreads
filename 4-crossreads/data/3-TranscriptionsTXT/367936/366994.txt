Thursday 15 June 1916Rostron and others left for Ras-el-tin Rasseldoon convalescent camp near Alexandria.  In evening five of us and a sister went for an hour's motor drive round Cairo, old Sava car.  Beautiful roads, asphalted all the way.  Saw the Nile and bridge.  Saw Sheppards and some very fine buildings.
