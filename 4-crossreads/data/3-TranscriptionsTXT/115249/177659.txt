 Have already recommended withdrawal of Troops from Wireless Station to Kaba Kaul, thence to Herbertshohe as garrison. &nbsp;Infantry now at Herbertshohe to come on board &quot;Berrima&quot;, which should then proceed to Rabaul to carry out original intention. &nbsp;If approved please instruct Beresford.
