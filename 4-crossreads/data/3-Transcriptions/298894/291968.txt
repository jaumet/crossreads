<p>remainder of the day. Our first place of call of the Greek Church rather fine in a way but the carving was rather crude &amp; the gilding etc last done 30 years ago was looking very tawdry. Various hanging silver lamps were of good workmanship as also the chandeliers. Various incidents of the bible were portrayed on the walls &amp; altar screen all giving one the impression of the ancient worship of the figures &amp; pictures. The man in charge received Franc 1 in backshish for his trouble from me. We next did our shopping my purchases consisting of  one pair of Greek shoes to send home for Gwen &amp; a Turkish rug of rather fine work for which I paid 15/- after some bargaining. From here we proceeded to the Ancient Turkish Fort about 600 year old &amp; were shewn over it by theLieutenant in Charge who afterwards returned with us to the village where we exchanged cards &amp; cracked various bottles of very fine beer from Salonika. It was now getting late but on looking for our donkeys we were amazed to find them gone, the boy evidently being afraid of doing the pass after dark. There was nothing for it but to set off rapidly to try to do the worst before</p>
