Miss Carell [Edith Cavell], an English nurse in Brussels, who was tried by Court-Martial for aiding British, French and Belgium prisoners of war to escape from Belgium, has been brutally murdered by order of the German authorities. A full account of this atrocity is given in papers issued by the Press Bureau in London on the 20th inst. Miss Carell was not allowed to see her counsel before trial, and was not permitted to inspect the documents for the prosecution. She was found guilty at a second CourtMartial and was condemned to death. Desperate protests by the United States and the Spanish Ministers in Brussels were ignored. Both Ministers pleaded for delay in order than an appeal might be lodged, but the Germans were unmoved. The execution took place at an early date after sentence had been passed. On seeing the firing party Miss Carell collapsed and was shot by a German officer while she lay on the ground. Intense indignation has been roused all over the world by this tragic example of German inhumanity.
