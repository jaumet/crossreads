a despatch. My rolled g.coat &   oil sheet w.p. cape actually  saved me from joining the great majority and when they were disentangling me from my gear somebody went to a lot of trouble to wake me up & tell me I'd topped the list of the Lucky.
Anyhow it was a great kick and what worries me most is that it blew my souvenirs to glory - they were good ones too, including buttons, a watch & pr glasses which had only been in my possession 20 minutes!
It took me 8 days to get this far & I'm expecting to be hopping round to-morrow or next day. After that I may
go to an Aust. M. or Conv.H.
Yesterday Austn RedX visitors called and left me papers, writing material etc, for this letter & bless them, a complete toilet outfit including a tip-top razor.
Ypres is a good place to be away from - war there has got down to about the lowest possible hell of filth and black ruin. Theres not a yard of ground that has not been torn up by HE. Just at the part I got caught in there are only three foot tracks in a mile to get through the shell holes, many of which are from 10 to 30 ft deep & half full of water - death traps full of death itself. Awful.
