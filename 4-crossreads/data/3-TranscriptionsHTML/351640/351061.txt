<p>During the afternoon I went along to Captain Pierro Fiaschi. I found him with a Mounted Infantry regiment at the left of the Australian position. The English force prolong the position still further to the left at Sulva Bay [Suvla Bay]. With Fiaschi I tramped up to the hills visited the most advanced posts where the men are ever on the look out for Turkish heads or bodies to show themselves above the trenches about three hundred yards distant. With a periscope I looked at the trenches held by the enemy, surveyed with my eyes the positions where Turkish snipers have their posts, with watchful eyes seeking for a chance to shoot one of our people. The Turks still hold the dominating ridges in this region. The marvel of it all is how our men have managed to perch themselves upon the eminences where they are situated. Wonderful! Truly wonderful!<br/>Manly, fearless Australians, night and day, conserve the interests of the Empire by, <strike>look</strike> fully armed, looking across the valley for an enemy to show himself, mayhap a Turk or his German mentor. The man from every section of our Island Continent who came as a light horseman does his turn on these dangerous perches.</p>

I found him busy</p>
