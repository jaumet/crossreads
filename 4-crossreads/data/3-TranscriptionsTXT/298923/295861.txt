14 July 1918 SundayI have much to tell you if I could write it all down.  GERMANS attacked us & at 2 AM. I galloped out with my Squadron & got into action just in time to save a Battery, we charged them & took 176 prisoners  Machine Guns & Automatic Rifles, then we were shelled very heavily by 6 inch HOWS *.  All day we got more prisoners:  Heat terrific-   Young fresh Rosy cheeked boys a lot of them & Officers with "gloves" & gloves & walking sticks - Took 3 Officers prisoner & killed a lot.  Water was our trouble, we had to stay out all night in the Trenches, the old 1st L H Brigade did very well.  We took very few Turks, all GERMANS.* 6 Inch Howitzers.
