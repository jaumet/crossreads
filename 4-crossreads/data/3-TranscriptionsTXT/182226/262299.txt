 Monday 4 October, 1915 
 Very heavy bombardment in the Anzac zone by both sides. 
 Am very comfortable here. The food is first class &amp; everyone tries to do all they can for you. 
 Have had a shave &amp; bath. I hope I don&#39;t catch a cold (?) 
 Am just lying about all the time yarning &amp; reading. 
 I am sorry in a way at being away from the firing line but I was not much use there as I was.
