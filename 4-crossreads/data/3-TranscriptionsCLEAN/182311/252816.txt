My Dear Ones,
   At last I have the opportunity to write a few lines and some kind friend to wit Gladys Moor has posted me a note book so now lack nothing and can go right ahead with the story.  Details as to dates and place names must of course be omitted, but that will not interfere with the yarn.
   'Tis only three weeks since we left Lark Hill, but really it seems like months, for in that time so much has happened, and as old Bailey says in "Festus" - "We live in Deeds and not in figures on a Dial."
   Well, "Perigrinations of Peters" recommenced when we left Amesbury by rail, journeyed to a port ^Southampton and crossed to France; the crossing in a small speedy and crowded steamer was safely accomplished, then a weary march of about six miles uphill to a "Rest Camp;" ^Le Havre. tired from the crossing and carrying an exceptionally heavy pack and two blankets - (my kit 65-lbs, the men much more) - the march was hardly joyful and all seemed pleased when the camp was reached and food and rest obtained, chiefly rest.  It was here that we made our first attempt at the French language, laughable too, in many cases, but here I found that my picked up French was much more useful that the academic French of companions.
   Here we had our first experience of French Cookery and very delightful too, beans cooked in butter, roasted chickens and French coffee served in cups without handles,
