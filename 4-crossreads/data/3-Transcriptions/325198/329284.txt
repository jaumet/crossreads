<p>16 April, 1916<br/>Salhia<br/>I received a letter from Bert last night, he is in Ypres in France lucky beggar, he says its cold though.  We had a beautiful two days wind storm through the week.  I slept out side &amp; could hear the boys tapping in the tent pegs all night.  Our tent collapsed &amp; fell across Godber, he only murmured some thing befitting the occasion &amp; went to sleep again.  We got paid to day thank goodness.  Ive been broke for a long time.</p>
