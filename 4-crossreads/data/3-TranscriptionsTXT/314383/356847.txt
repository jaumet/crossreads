Mar 19We reach Amara, a large town on the river. Said to be noted for its wonderful brass work.  We stay for three or four hours & go ashore.  Latchford & wander across to the officers club, then cross the stream in a native boat & put in an hour at a picture show, filled with yabbering Arabs, the fat only  [indecipherable] to do ones sitting on the easy seats   thatnear us.  The pictures are antiquated but evidently enjoyed by the audience who became extremely excited at times.  We nearly miss our boat but fortunately bribe a tommy motor boat driver to chase our craft which we board while on the move.
