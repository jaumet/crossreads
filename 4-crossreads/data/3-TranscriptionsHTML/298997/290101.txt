<p>June 19<br/>I am at Clapton Hospital, London, a rather bare place, which used to be  a workhouse &ndash; it must be cold &amp; cheerless in the winter.  Left No 2 C. Stationary Hospital on the 16th and went on board the "St Denis" at Boulogne.  Whenever the stretcher was going to be carried I wanted to walk; but was shoved back again.  When we were going on board, the man on the stretcher ahead of me proved to be Hampton, a new arrival, since it was smashed, in my platoon, and a man who was with us a Marie Cappel when I became ill.<br/>He has it in the leg, &amp; has come, also, to this hospital.  His wound came in a hopover, a week ago.  The curious thing is that I wrote to him &amp; two others to make sure of having my pack &amp; things in it looked after; and Hampton tells me that the other two, poor Somerville, (who got the fictionally frequent but war-rare "shot through the heart"), and Leyton, have both been killed.I came over to England in a pyjama coat merely, the Hospital being short of things; &amp; I have very little with me, though what I have includes the inevitable pen &amp; bottle of ink.  I don't seem able to keep fountain pens, having lost three.  I suppose the souvenirs in my pack are gone.</p>
