<p>Last week we went to Mrs. Jims as he had 3 days final leave. Jim is very busy at Liverpool now, late &amp; early, he does not know the actual date of sailing, but expects it to be very soon, &amp; believes his boat is the "Ceramic". With us there were Mr. &amp; Mrs Hugh McM. &amp; Harvey, a Miss Ramiocoth, a corporal, Wint, &amp; Jim's 3 boys. He showed us the things the football crowd had given a few nights ago. The best gift was a personal one from T. W. Henderson, pair of &pound;10-10-0 Ziess glasses, the best made.</p>
<p>Somehow, I dont think Jim will be good for much hard physical exertion, but he is strong on tactics, &amp; it is said the men all like him very much, especially since he did the 19 mile days march with them. His orderly tries to keep him as tidy as possible.</p>
<p>Have heard nothing from Harold yet &ndash; he should be about in Egypt now. Last heard of Reg, he had been sent with 15 companions of signalling corps to the island of Lemnos. He had sent home some small photos, but I have not seen them yet.</p>
<p>Before I forget I may mention that all the photos you left have been distributed, some by</p>
