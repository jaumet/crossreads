<p>the party on board only received abrasions. These mines are fairly common, the enemy using delayed action fuses &amp; all hands are wary. Collected more supplies from the M.D.S. today &amp; sent some forward to the R.A.P.'s. The A.D.M.S. has made our camp his H.Q.'s &amp; we expect a move owing to the advance. Sent home today a parcel containing german drugs etc.</p>
<p>Thursday 29th August<br/>Good weather again. Collected dressings &amp; stores from Daours in the afternoon also went to the car workshops at Petit Camion. It was a good sight to see all the crops harvested &amp; the Frenchies old &amp; young are certainly working overtime, in some places troops are used for the purpose. There are now 5 C.CS. at Daours &amp; two are moving up forthwith to keep face with advance which still continues. Wanting some Sod. Carb. which I had forgotten to order, I went down to the C.C.S. with patients about 8 P.M. &amp; arrived back about 11.30. The night was cool &amp; very dark but the ride was enjoyable, very little traffic on the road. Had a stroll round viewing some german ammunition dumps near, which were well concealed, a second dump</p>
