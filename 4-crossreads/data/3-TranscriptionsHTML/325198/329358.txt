<p>8 Sept, 1916<br/>Montazah<br/>I am all ready for a move once more.  The hand is blistered on the sore <strike>again</strike> I hope its not going to turn septic again. Eggs for breakfast this morning.  Its always a lively scene when eggs are on.  One boy said he got one good egg out of four.  he was told he was lucky.  I got two out of three.  In the boom.  Some whisky knocking about last night evidently by the liveness of certain lads.  "?" Where do they get it?<br/>Bottled stuff prohibited;  One bright lad said it was possible to get the chap behind the counter to sell a bottle to himself &amp; influence him to make  you a present of it.<br/>It seems red hot in clobber again after doing the [indecipherable] act for so long.</p>
<p>9th  Sat<br/>Got my watch &ndash; its quite important I feel to be able to tell people the time in stead of asking it.  Nine letter were given me also</p>
