<p>The whole of our Platoon was in this position but about midnight last night I had to occupy our present post, which we are holding  with 7 men &amp; one gun, and things are very quiet just at present, and our post is just like the one I was in 10 days ago. The one I have just left was a German post, with a good lot of stuff of theirs about, and a couple of dugouts started that were evidently meant to be very deep &amp; big, but they did not have a chance of finishing them. 22-7-18 We were relieved from our posts last night and back moved into the front line. Mr Williams took over the posts occupied by our Platoon. Sgt Galland (who came over with us from Aussie) took over my post. Fritz's Artillery was very active this morning, and shelled very heavily, especially with Gas, we thought he must have been going to have a "hop-over", and were "standing to" most of the night expecting him, but nothing happened, he must have thought <u>we</u> were going over, and was trying to get in ahead of us. 23/7/18 Last night</p>
