9th Fighting continues all night, first in favour of one then the other. In several places the British gained a position and held on. The Turkish fighters very troublesome, picking off many men,
About 7.A.M. a force of about 200 Turks jumped from their trenches and attacked us on "Saliers Post" we were about 130 strong and the boys were very fatigued after the last few days hard work, but every man sprang to it, grabbed his rifle and got to them, the range being about 200 yards only, it was almost impossible to miss hitting someone. As the Turks left their trenches and ran down the opposite slop to attack us led by a big German Officer, we let them have it properly. They went over like "skittles", of course the German got more than one bullet. More than half the attackers must have fell, a few got close to our trenches 3 of them were just about to Bomb our Machine Gun when they were shot. Their wounded that were able crept back to their own lines, our casualties were slight 4 of our chaps being wounded. They came at us again after dark but our bombs being directed well kept them off, but our loss,es were heavier They attacked the K.O.S.B on our right and were repulsed.
