<p>I have been to London again on Duty.  I had to go with the Sgt. of the Guard to take 10 prisoners up to Lewes Jail near Brighton.  I left the Hospital at 8 a.m. &amp; arrived in London at 1.5 p.m.  We hurried on the Police Motor &amp; had a mad gallop round over Westminster Bridge &amp; past the Houses of Parliament &amp; Abbey along Victoria St. to Victoria Station.  We just caught the train to Brighton.  We had dinner of Bully-beef &amp; Bread &amp; margarine.  We eventually arrived at Lewes &amp; handed over our prisoners at 4 p.m.  We walked back to the Railway, Sgt. 10 Guard &amp; myself.</p>
