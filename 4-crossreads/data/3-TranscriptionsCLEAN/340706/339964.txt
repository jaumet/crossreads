 On arrival we pass down Rue de Paris examine Bassin & then on to Jetty round by way of St Addresse. Then return & go up the Funiculaire from the street on the top we have a splendid view of the city which is even more picturesque by night. Then visit Tortonis an overrated cafe crammed full of girls & officers seated at tables which are so close that it is impossible to move. 
 We leave here soon after chatting to a little girl in the corner & so to Cafe Gabriel an American Bar. Here as tables are few we drink our whiskies seated on high stools. We wander into Majestic Cafe & then into Cafe Moderne which is the best & most decent place in town & much patronised by the respectable French element. 
 After dinner we went to a cinema & then caught a train which leaves after usual hour runs for officers only & leaves at 10 am We get in as car is going wrong way & shunt about for a quarter hour - finally get back in camp
