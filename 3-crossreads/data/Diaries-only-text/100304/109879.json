9/9/16
After breakfast walked over the old bridge and across the other side of Torridge along lanes in the direction of Torrington The roads are mostly sunken and enclosed with hedges. Glimpses of very quiet peaceful country, browsing herds etc. All trees are in full leaf ? winter must be a different spectacle. Returned for lunch, the tide racing through the piers of the bridge and transforming the river from a shoaly stream into a fine estuary. The arches of the bridge are irregular ? some small and some large. Walked round the older portion of the town along streets that twist in most tortuous fashion and made way back to Tantons. Caught the 3.40 p.m. train for Waterloo, changing at Exeter. At Salisbury one of our lads parting from his dainty little piece of fluff. Very affecting. Most resonant kisses. The country looks very snug and compact all along. Taxied to G.N.R. Hotel at Kings Cross and put up there. Little devil of girl in office all on for a joke.
