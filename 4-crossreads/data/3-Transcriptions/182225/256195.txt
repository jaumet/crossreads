<p>Fine, but came on to rain at night &amp; I had to sleep in the tent at night. Working for the Sargent Farrier in morning and carting dirt from Stables in afternoon. They put the horses in the waggons for the first time &amp; they went first rate. with a few exceptions. Nicked away early &amp; met Linda, Jo &amp; M<sup>r</sup>&nbsp;Lloyd on the wharf &amp; came over with them. Got back to camp by 9.45 train</p>
