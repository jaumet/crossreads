<p><u>Private [Carnegie?]</u></p>
<p>The same remarks apply to this man and also to</p>
<p><u>Privates Tingle &amp; Brown &amp; Kirkpatrick &amp; Cruikshank</u>.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it would be hard to find steadier &amp; more reliable men in the whole battalion.</p>
<p><u>Private Martin</u></p>
<p>This is another good man. Has had Imperial service, &amp; passed some military examinations. His control is good.</p>
