Artillery. Park section) - & our colour patches consist of a red shell with  S / 6  in blue  We started up & went up to Neuve Eglise for amunition, but there was nothing doing when we got there so we went back to park. We went for a five kilometre walk before we went to bed. 
   
 Jan 2  nd    We were all put on fatigue work taking down a Y.M.C.A. Hut which the 3  rd   D.S.C. intended taking with them when they moved, which they are anticipating  - Weather very soft & a little rain fell. 
   
 Jan 3  rd    3  rd   D.S.C. moved to Bailleul Armentieres road next to 1  st   A.S.P. & we moved with them. in the afternoon we did a bit of cleaning on the lorry. Weather mild & bright & sunny. Fritz put over a bit of shrapnel trying for the baloon over K column workshop 
   
 Jan 4  th    We were busy all the morning cleaning underneath the lorry thoroughly as our new officer (Joe Grim, as he was known to the section) went crook at us for the filthy state of the lorry (as he expressed it)
