<p>to have its back broken. Who would have thought last April &amp; May such a sudden change would come over things? The Aussies have more than done their bit in this great push &ndash; just on our own sector prisoners constantly poured back &amp; we advanced a terrific distance since it first began. We have lost some grand men though, part of war's hellish price. God grant, there may never be another one on this earth! Our brigade are all out for a thoroughly well earned rest, but there are French, English &amp; Yanks galore to carry on the big advance unceasingly &amp; Fritz will get no respite.<br/>Saty. 31 Aug.<br/>I have been very crook lately with diarrhoea &amp; pains in the stomach, &amp; was sent today in a motor ambulance to the 61st Casualty Clearing Station. There are 3 wounded Huns in the ward I'm in, &amp; to complete the mixture, a tall Indian came in.<br/>Thursday 5 Sep.<br/>Arrived by hospital train at Rouen, &amp; was taken to No. 10 General Hospital. The advance goes on on all sectors &amp; Fritz is getting the hell he deserves. The whole of the Aussie divisions are to have a long spell, so I won't be destined to see any more German stoush &amp; fireworks. Our numbers are so small now that I think the heads have brought our chaps</p>
