<p>September 1917<br/>Mrs Warner's &amp; had lunch there.  They sent my parcel OK.  Went down to the National Hotel &amp; saw Jack Garden who is up on leave &amp; had a game of billiards.  Caught the 4.15 train to Alex.  Went down with Sergt Markwell of the 1st LH who is at the School with me.  We got to Alex about 8.30 &amp; I went &amp; got a room at the Windsor.  Afterwards went round to Mrs Averinos place &amp; spent the evening there.</p>
<p>Sunday 9th<br/>Had a good sleep in followed by a hot bath, shave boots-a-clean etc &amp; a good breakfast.  Could not make myself believe I was not a civilian again.  Went to the beach with the family.  There was great crowd there.  It was beautiful &amp; cool &amp; an English military band was playing.  It is not much of a place for a swim being too rocky.  Had lunch in the box &amp; smoked &amp; lolled about in a deck chair till nearly dark.  Took the girls out for tea &amp; spent the evening up till the train went at the house.  Got a first class apartment from the guard by arrangement, picked up Markwell &amp; had a seat each to sleep on all the way to Cairo</p>
