<p>little nook in the rocky Hills. The rocks were all colored &amp; interspersed with green shrubs the appearance was fine. Everything looked comfortable &ndash; Tents &ndash; Hats &amp; other conveniences. I saw some of the Surrey Yeomanry chaps who came over on the "Southland" when I returned to the front after being wounded. After a chat we walked a few miles to the aerodrome &amp; saw the celebrated Samsons air ship &ndash; a converted Seaplane. Had talks with mechanics &amp; enquired for Capt Japp &amp; found he was over at No 3 Wing on the other side of harbour. Retd to Camp &amp; had dinner of Salmon &amp; cabbage. It tasted like lobster when mashed together &amp; I can recommend it.</p>
