very serious offence, for they can so easily give the show away cause a lot of trouble for noise always attracts fire.
Funny to say the neutrality ceased tonight for they fired at me while going out to our outposts they also had a pot at the machine gunners going out, so I had to take the 3rd Batt. relief in a rotten old trench, it was pretty late by the time the last of us got away we had a long weary march in front of us to Bazentin No 5. Camp I was just about knocked out by the time we sighted our camp I simply threw myself down went to sleep did not wake up till 10 next morning.
We had a good breakfast for there was a lot of parcels waiting for us
