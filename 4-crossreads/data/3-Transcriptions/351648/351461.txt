<p>Surprised indeed &ndash; I should say I was when I got your letter, but I shant leave my reply quite as long as you did yours, the correspondence would be too attenuated &amp; if things fell off in the corresponding line, as they generally do, they would average about 1&frac12; each in 3 years or so which would be too strenuous.
