<p>1915<br/>July 29 Thu.<br/>Have great fun in Gezira Gardens after tea in the evenings now.  Strike up acquaintances with kiddies of all nationalities who play about there, &amp; speak to them in a mixture of French &amp; English. Quite decent practice in French conversation.<br/>My companion in these strolls is Ray Smith &ndash; a very decent chap.</p>
