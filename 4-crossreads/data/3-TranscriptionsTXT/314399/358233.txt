Sunday 24 August 1919Stomach upset. Will have to take some Gregory's. It doesn't take much to put a color on my tongue these days. Think I want a lot of football. Read today & did a bit of printing. All my photos of Cape Town turned out well.Feel upside down tonight. Just can't be bothered doing anything.
Monday 25 August 1919See the coast all day. Saw a few farms. Very little of the ground tho was cultivated. The majority of it looked very bare with trees & shrubs here & there & plenty of rocks. Nice big breeze. Read all day. Played a few hands of rummy & sevens after dinner.
