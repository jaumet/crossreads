<p>Ribemont, not far from Albert. On this trip we passed through the city of Ameins where later on I spent 2 days leave &amp; which in the latter part of the war, we were to defend in one of the hottest battles on the western front.</p>
<p>At Ribemont we stayed one night, and next morning 22nd of October we were told to put everything in our packs except 1 Blanket, our equipment, Rifle, &amp; Ammunition, also our overcoats and waterproof sheets, as our packs were going to be stored away while we were up the line.</p>
<p>About 8 am we left Ribemont &amp; started for Mametz Wood, which was well in the battle area, where we were to spend one night before going into the Line at Flers to relieve the Tommies who were then in occupation. The march from Ribemont was uneventful until we arrived at Mametz when a couple of coal boxes or High explosive schrapnel shells went overhead with a whiz &amp; a Bang.</p>
