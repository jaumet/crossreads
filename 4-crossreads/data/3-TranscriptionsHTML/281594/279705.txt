<p>banks of the River Somme  To-day all is quietness and peace, but all had not been peace at one time, as right along the banks of the river were shell holes in large numbers</p>
<p>In the afternoon we walked out to see the huge gun which had been captured by the Aust. All over the fields there lay ammunition of every description, a few graves of German soldiers with their rifle with the point stuck into the ground and their helmet put on the butt end of the rifle</p>
<p>The captured gun, the barrel of which lay on the ground was the biggest that I have ever seen. The barrel had been blown off by the Germens before they had retreated  To get on to the top and look down into the pit was like looking down into the hold of one of our large ships</p>
<p>An ordinary railroad led right up to the gun. The shells for this gun are said to weigh a ton and had to be taken up on a narrow railway on specially made trolleys  Splendid dug-outs were made here and the site of this gun was hidden amongst a clump of trees. In a radius of a few miles there were five clumps of trees exactly similiar to the one</p>
