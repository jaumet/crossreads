 After 5 weeks in Cyprus I asked to be sent home or back to Alexandria well now they have sent me to a convalescent home a magnificent private residence, the lady in charge is the mistress of the house every thing is of the very best beautifully situated near the sea about 2 miles out of Alexandria. 
 Terry has gone across to the Dardanelles has been there now for some time and is doing well I am sorry to say I can't  give you any definite news except that he is quiet well of course in Artillery we are pretty safe if we take ordinary measures of safety. So far our casualties have been very few. 
 I hope Mrs Garling &amp; Pat are in the best of health and I will write to Pat as soon as possible. 
 Yours sincerely Eric Lenehan
