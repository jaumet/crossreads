to Salisbury for some time but expect to go in next week.  I went to London last Monday as I told you.  I met a Jack O'Neil on Marylebone Station.  He is Brother to Billy O'Neil, one of Petersham's best Lacrosseurs.  I am very fortunate in striking old acquaintances or their Friends.  He is working on Munitions over here.  I met His wife & we all went to Dinner together.  She is very much like our Ida.  I am telling you all this in case you meet
