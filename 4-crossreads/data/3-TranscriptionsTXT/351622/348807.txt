6 April 1916 ThurAn uneventful day nothing in particular happened save that we received orders that we are to pack up to-night & march back to Thiennes to join our Head Quarters. Left Steenbecque 5.30 pm after bidding farewell to Jeanie & Madeline. Thus ends the happiest week I have spent in the army.
7 April 1916 FriReveille at 5 am early breakfast & with packs up left Thiennes. All the 5th Brigade leave Steenbercque to-gether. A great sight. Pass General Joffre & staff on the road. Passed through Hazebrouck dinner time & several other villages during day. Arr Outersteene about 5 pm. after doing some 15 miles. Camped for the night in an old school room.
