then pushed over to a little copse where we located headquarters. I then saw Colonel James. There is a rumour that we advance this afternoon pass through the present front line. James I work together and have a battery of field artillery attached to us. Held a conference of my company commanders and then gave them all the information I could and allotted such frontages formations as was possible. This little copse is full of small bivvies and yesterday dead Germans were lying around but they have now all been buried. Our cookers and L.G. limbers have now moved off up to us. The men are all disposed in the front line (Black line) and there await any orders that may be wanted. Wall came back to us here this morning.
