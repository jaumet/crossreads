<p>I dread the Mess room below. The stench there is terrible---stale beer, stables and rotting straw, grease, foul air, and all the multitudinous odours from the lower hold.</p>
<p>Thursday, 23.<br/>We arrived at Marseilles at 10.30am. Towers and warehouses typical of a big sea port. Parade, full kit, 10.45am. then stables. Attended both and did my whack. Sent for in afternoon by L. I was in hospital getting some stuff for my neuralgia. On presenting myself to him down at stables, he accused me before an officer of not having been on parade at 10.45am. or doing stables that day, and that I had done nothing but moan since I had been on the boat. I corrected him afterwards, and he half apologised and said he had been told to give me a slating by the Brigade W.O. who had seen me in hospital and did not know I was under treatment. Went and slogged into stables. Took charge Baggage Guard at 5pm. till 12 midnight. Everything entrained by 1am. We departed at 1.30am. Dry bread and tea for evening meal.</p>
<p>Friday, 24, and Saturday, 25.<br/>A little sleep. France! We pass up the valley of the Rhone, through the land of Daudet---Avignon, Lyons etc. It is beautiful. Here an old battered grey castle---quaint, red tiled cottages---beautiful towns---and the charm and smile of the daughters of France. The elms and poplars, cyprus, pines. It is all beautiful---one drinks it in---but to describe it must be left till later---the beauty of it all leaves one powerless now.</p>
<p>Sunday, 26.<br/>Havre-disentrainment. March through town with horses and mules. Bleak and grey sky---muddy streets. No. 2 Camp two or three miles out. Put horse lines down. Finished at 8.pm.</p>
