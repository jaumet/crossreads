<p>As regards allowances during the period June 7th-Aug. 11th.  In no sense can Aberystwyth be looked upon as my Headquarters for this period.</p>
<p>If reference is made to letters and telegrams of parallel date it will be seen that the choice of Headquarters and a clear definition of my position was pleaded for.</p>
<p>I was forced to stay at an Hotel while the London Office was reorganising the Division and I was waiting to hear definitely what my position was and where my Headquarters were to be.</p>
<p>During this unsettled period I worked at developing the Hafod and Crosswood Workings from early morning to late at night the while planning out in co-operation with Mr Penney the scheme for working the Haverfordwest and Cardigan Workings.</p>
<p>By continually asking the London Office for a definite ruling on this matter of Headquarters, I eventually received visits from Capt. Stabers and later Mr Robert Money and although these two gentlemen were sympathetic and approved of my plans for the future, settlement of Headquarters was still further posponed, and it was only after I had been in charge of the Haverfordwest area some considerable time that it was settled that I was to look upon Haverfordwest as my local Headquarters.</p>
<p>When this assurance was given I immediately made arrangements accordingly.</p>
<p>For further evidence, if required, please refer to &ndash; Prof. Fraser Story, Arvonia Buildings, Bangor.</p>
<p>In conclusion I beg to state that since taking Office under The Board of Trade Timber Supplies Dept. all my time and energy has been expended in serving the Dept. to the fullest extent and I do not consider it to be just or fair that the disorganisation in the Department which obtained during the period alluded to, should result, in my case, in the curtailment of allowances which I now claim.</p>
