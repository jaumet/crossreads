  
 Thursday. 31st. Dec 1914. Got up at 7.30 &  had breakfast  in pygamas. Then went back to bed. Got up at 11 for a lecture. Went to Geo Reid big parade at 2 o'clock. He spoke to us but we couldn't hear much. We marched past him. The parade was very good. Went down &   found Major Bennetts tent but he was at Mess, so couldn't see him. Went to bed at 8 o'clock & asked to be awakened at 10.30 but woke up myself at 12.5. And so started the new Year. Must start a new book now so good night or rather morning. 
 Finished
