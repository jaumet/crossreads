ThursdayLeft camp again at 9 oclock, marched into the Station & entrained.  It is now 2 oclock & we leave at 3 for 36 hr. journey.  The men are in Cattle trucks each holding about 30 men.  This is the first time they have had the experience of Cattle trucks & the comments are amusing.Spent all day on the Train & all night, travelling very slowly.
Friday, 24Still in the train.  The country is not much good and the houses poor.  We are travelling up the coast.  Passed through Abbeyville, Boulonge & the suburbs of Calais.  Arrived at Balieul at 10 p.m.  The Trenches are not far away.  The flare lights & star shells light up the sky & the Guns can be heard quite distinctly.The Batt. set out to walk 6 miles to Billets.  The Guides lost them & it was 5 oclock before the men got to Billets.  The sacks were very heavy and they were quite exhausted.
