their officers contrary to our practice, using whistles very freely. Their halts under barrage were as frequent as they were short and here to my mind, the operation fails. Throughout the density is too intense and numbers so many that the men are nothing but food for m.g.s. In the latter stages the dense lines doing these frequent halts under barrages must afford great chances for the guns on the slopes in front. At about 6 a.m. formed up and marched back to Camp. Went to bed after a bracing hand gallop over the fields and slept until about 10.20 when Hunt brought some breakfast. Then slept on till 1 pm when the C.O. returned from an F.G.C.M. in the afternoon put the whole battalion through wire traversing with mats and the keeping of their waves after passage of obstacles. Went at 6pm with the Dr Spiller to the Baths in the village for a good hot shower.
