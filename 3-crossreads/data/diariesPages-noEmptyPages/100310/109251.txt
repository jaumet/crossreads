4/8/17 Campagne, Roquetoire Aire 
Parade in billets. Weather slightly finer. Made an inspection of A D Coys and found work progressing satisfactorily and then walked part of the way down to Wardrecques. Winding leafy lanes with red thatched farmhouses with walls new whitewashed. Along a field track to the 21st and there saw Padre Lamble and Henry Crowther just back from leave. Returned to our own billets and found Padre Major F H Durnford M.C back from leave laden up to the eyes with comforts for the troops and sports material. Also a new gramophone which we tested and soon collected an audience of M'selle and the 2 little youngsters. The little girl became frightened at the music cried. after lunch dealt with several cases of absence without leave and applied the acid where needed. The horses were there waiting for the doctor, Davis and myself, and we set off first off all the visit Roquetoire and Ligne de Roquetoire ? our first billets in France after landing 18 months ago. The ride was very nice
