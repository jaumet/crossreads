<p>the parcel I sent by Captain Richardson &amp; hope he managed to get out to see you. He is such a quiet man but an awfully brave, good fellow. Hope you all liked him?<br/>I should love to receive a Photo of dear old mother &amp; Eddy taken together in the garden. Suppose you are nearly frozen, while we are nearly <u>cooked</u>    <br/>Fondest love &amp; kisses to you all &amp; trust you are all well. I am expecting a few letters this week, just got a few odd ones last week.<br/>I am,                                                                                                                                                                                                             yours lovingly,                                                                                                                                                                                             Edith</p>
