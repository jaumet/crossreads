the first of the 59th Battalion came up and marched through to our relief. All went well and smoothly. Going out to a listening post they had a man wounded and in our trench we had a man killed. Discussed the defence with Colonel Scanlon and handed over also to him our U.S.A. Major. By 1 am. All coys had reported "Relief complete" and Sutherland and I set off on horseback. It was an extra quiet night on the front. Rode back to Franvillers and found our mess quite comfortable under the Presidency of Habel. Yarned here with our fellows and then went over to our old home in the trench to write for a while before going to sleep. It was breaking down before I turned in.
