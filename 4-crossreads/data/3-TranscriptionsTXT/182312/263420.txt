 old London motor bus after the show and brought them up to our mess 
 for some morning tea.&nbsp; Our Commandant Major Vaughan (son of Canon 
 Vaughan) rang up their matron to ask could they stay to lunch, but 
 he got such a NO back over the telephone that he won&#39;t try it on any 
 more matrons. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are having some baths erected for the officers here - typical- 
 ly English no shower, nor cold water tap all the water having to 
 come through a bath-heater.&nbsp; English folk still hold the idea that on 
 one hot bath per week is better than a shower or two every day.&nbsp; They 
 certainly look well on it, and I have not noticed them scratching 
 themselves much. 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The System of Forestation is very complete in France.&nbsp; As soon 
 as a piece of land has become worked for farming purposes it is im- 
 mediately planted with trees so that there is practically no waste 
 land in France, for what isn&#39;t growing crops for feeding stock is 
 growing trees.&nbsp; This must have been going on for many years past, as 
 you will frequently come across what on first sight would appear to 
 be virgin forest land, but on closer inspection it will be found that 
 the trees are in rows showing that the importance of Forestation 
 has long been recognised by the French people.&nbsp; All roads throughout 
 the country are bordered by trees - deciduous trees which give the 
 roads a chance of keeping dry in the winter and afford shade in the 
 summer.&nbsp; Australia could with benefit adopt both these ideas and 
 thus show a proper appreciation of the value of trees which at pres- 
 sent seems altogether lacking.
