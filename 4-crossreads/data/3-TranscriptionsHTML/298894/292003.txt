<p>Later I met a Captain of a Collier having a stroll &amp; he has promised to bring me ashore tomorrow any papers he can gather. Weather dull but fine.<br/>Monday 6th. Spent a very fair night although I went to bed till 10 after taking some Aspirin. Pains were running all through my nether limbs but had eased considerably by 10 P.M. when I went on duty. In the morning I went to get a sleep in the sleeping tent but found a fellow ding carpentering there who refused to shift necessitating me bringing along the needful authority to do so. This afternoon I went to meet my Captain friend &amp; received 3 magazines &amp; a paper. It was all I could do to walk from the pains coming on very badly. I hope the Rheumatism is not getting me.<br/>Tuesday 7th. Put on a  new shift. 7 A.M. to 3 P.M. Nothing much doing however. Had Rheumatic pains all day &amp; have felt off colour generally. Received a parcel 2 pairs  socks. Weather mild but fair &amp; dull.<br/>Wednesday 8th. Feeling dead off but manage to get along without going sick. Received an issue of Red Gross Gift.</p>
