1917 Friday 26 Jan.
A day of varied experiences. We left our main dressing Station at 10 a.m. walking along tram-line to Miller's Post. Frost still holding surface slippery as glass. Left our packs at M.D.S. taking only our blankets tucker. Arrive at Edward's Post after 3 narrow escapes from bursting shells. They all lobbed too close to be healthy smothered us with clods dirt. Shrapnel too. Shortly after leaving Edward's Post for relay stations further forward 6 Shells in rapid succession lobbed all round us. One of our chaps hit on shoulder. Ridg. self render first aid. My squad Reynolds selected for farthest post forward. Dubious honour,? Waiting for one of my squad new man, lagging behind we miss the others get lost in sap. Ultimately arrive at our possie safely. Deep dugout, terribly overcrowded tho?. Make the best of it. Almost immediately have a carry down to next relay. A lucky "dud" lobbed just beyond us once.
Anniversary Day! I wonder what they did at home?
