Lunch 12.30 - Aft tea 3.30 - Dinner 7 pm & you keep the time yourself - Food is very very plain & simple -  No  fresh meat no courses - two things for dinner & that's all - we are supposed to provide our own soap. Towels - (10d each) - I've bought 3 - We pay for our messing - We're only allowed a 2nd rate cook (isn't that rot). When I return I shall claim for my expenses - By the way - if you don't get 29 each month - write to Staff Pay Master - Hoare - Garden Island & raise a long, well drawn out, well sustained moan & go on moaning until you get it - The blighters in Melbourne are dead one wd think - At 9 am - The commander read prayers to the assembled crew - Caps off & on he went - This took some 7 minutes - I know we want to be protected against "the violence of the enemy" & get back to our own land & to follow out "our lawful occupations" for Jesus Christ's sake - Amen -
