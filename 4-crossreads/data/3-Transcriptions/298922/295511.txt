<p>Friday 20 July 1917</p>
<p>Heavy Fog &amp; both Turks&amp; our own Battery kept up a Bombardment. We were out on a driva all night &amp; got some Bedouin spys &amp; Patrols, and 13 Turk prisoners. Killed a few. Night &amp; day have been turned into one lately, it is hard to keep count. We were only in Camp long enough to fill our NOSE BAGS &amp; get some Tucker &amp; off again &ndash; "Taubes" killed a few New Zealanders with bombs. I opened fire but the Target is so small, a square yard only vulnerable &amp; that travelling at the rate of 60 or so miles an hour, takes hitting.</p>
