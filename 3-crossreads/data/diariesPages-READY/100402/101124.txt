At 4 a.m. or a little later our barrage opened the 1st Division went over advanced at least 3000 yards more likely more, but news is scarce the actual result is indefinite. However, it was a success over 3000 prisoners have been taken, many coming through our post helping to evacuate the wounded. The wounded of course were many but not extraordinary I believe Fritz shelled heavily but here in the back area I only heard about ten all told .Our casualties, all lightly wounded till now and Pearn, Cartaar, Bourke Fritcroft, all lightly wounded. A big percentage of wounded were Boshes. Still at loading post Mericourt-sur-Somme.
Saturday 24 August
A very quiet night. This morning we moved up to 4th Battn. R.A.P. in front of Chyvolles where yesterday there was plenty of work, but everything is quiet to-day in fact we have a Ford car right up here. A good dugout, old French, about a kilo or so over the old front line dug in the leeward of a good hill. Spasmodic shelling but no casualties.
