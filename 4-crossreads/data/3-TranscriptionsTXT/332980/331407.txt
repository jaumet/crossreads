following the Train line through the Square & in a few moments arrived at the Salvation Army Hostel where I went in upstairs & obtained a Cup of Tea & having some Rations with me I had a light Meal, then I continued on passing over another Canal to the Australian Supply Depot, where I met some friends & was invited to come back at 12 for Dinner, after a stroll around the Docks I returned & had a Bon Dinner with the Boys, after a Smoke I thanked them & off I went, I was directed to follow the Train Line & soon I would be at Milo Les Sands which was a favorite Promenade along the Beach in Pre War Times, After walking some distance I arrived at the Ramparts where a Sentry demanded my Pass & then I was permitted to proceed & arrived at Milo Les Sands in a few minutes & found the Promenade & Beach almost deserted & in a very neglected condition, Nearly all the Beautiful Buildings are nearly all empty & closed up & the place is very desolate, As my Train for my return Journey did not leave until 5 Pm
