Morning one of our aeroplanes was hit by the enemy managed to fly as far as our lines where he volplaned down, both he his machine were saved. Late yesterday evening one of our stationary observing Balloons broke away drifted towards the German Lines, it was great to see the our aeroplanes trying to catch it. The pilot descended in his parachute our machines finally exploded it with bombs.The 15th of this month is called Asumption Day here is commemorated by big feasts, a religious rite, having some connection with the Virgin Mary. It is generally thought by all hands that a terrific offensive will start on that day, especially as our Engineers have made fast the suspended Image of the Virgin Mary, in the Cathedral Tower in Albert. If this falls the French peasantry are bound to regard it as an ill-omen, unless the Bosches score a direct hit, it will not come down.Our convoy has just left Senlis for a place beyond Albert, the Germans are at the present time busy in shelling the Road, whether they succeed in getting any I am at the present unable to say but I do not like it.We are all looking forward to a spell in a weeks time hope that they do not disappoint us.Received a batch of letters but am unable to write at present.There was a blessed Group of machine guns firing close to us last night
