<p>fully recognised</p>
<p>This recognition could not be mistaken during the whole of the march. After 4 hours of continuous marching we arrived back at Hyde Park and had tea.</p>
<p>Caching the train again at 8PM. we arrived back at Camp at 1AM feeling just about dead beat</p>
<p>But it was an experience I would not have missed.</p>
