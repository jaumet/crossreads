weight for 8', & nice dairy butter at 1/3 a pound. The wine is 10d a bottle & tastes good, but rather bitter. Fair sized village & a fine big Church. Had cold bath
April Fools Day Got hold of some straw last night & made a decent bed although we slept a little cold. Turned out fairly early and went for a sprint down to the village  Heavy frost but felt tip top after my run. Just like August in Aust, & reminds me of the long past winter mornings when Mont & I used to go for a long walk over the hills of dear old Tamworth. Only tea & tea for brek. Trains rush past every few minutes - passenger, military, red-cross & goods, & some of them travel too, as most of the lines are built for speed & being wide gauge (5ft) the rocking is barely noticeable. There are a great number of Nord Engines with big driving wheels. Have noticed a few hares & rabbits but not many birds (too cold yet)
