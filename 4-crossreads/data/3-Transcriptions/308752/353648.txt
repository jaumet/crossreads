<p>of Peter denying Christ &amp; Hell. Words cannot describe the marvellous piece of work, that is in these carvings. All cut out of solid oak, and were completed in the 14th Century. All round here the buildings were in a dilapidated condition, we were told that this was old Antwerp, dating from the 2nd Century. The next place of interest visited was the Musee Plantin &ndash; Moretus (Plantin Museum).  It contained old printing machines &amp; documents &amp; books, that were written before printing was invented.  I saw a copy of the bible entirely written in Latin. Who ever did it certainly had a tedious job. Not far off was another church - St. Andrew Cathedral, built in 1529. From outside the place is nothing to rave about;  but on entering one is thrilled by the marvellous sculpturing &amp; magnificent paintings, that adorn the building.</p>
<p>A short walk through the beautiful Park brought us to the Harbour or river front. Unfortunately the day was a dull one and we did not view the scenery at its best. The harbour extends for over three miles along the Scheldt, and must have been a very important place for Fritz to hold for four years. We obtained a fine view of the river &amp; the busy scenes on the wharves from the Promenade, that runs along a portion of the bank.</p>
