<p>The 2nd  &amp;  3rd Bgdes are at Bir Salmana, they will attack at dawn tomorrow.<br/>By the way I think we have been a little too ambitious this time as we  - 12<br/>ltus Division &ndash; are attacking &ndash; as far as we know 2600 turks with 4 mountain batteries  &amp;  10 machine guns, all of which are well entrenched  &amp;  will take a deal of digging out unless we make a complete surprise; which is almost an impossibility for an enemy 'plane has been over two or three times this morning. I am afraid it will be a failure.<br/>We are supports  &amp;  do not leave here</p>
