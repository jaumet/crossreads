a lot of changing from bus to train & tube eventually arrived at Paddington at 11.15.London seems to be taking the war news very calmly just an ordinary occurence it now seems to be but underlying all the masked indifference you can see how glad & pleased they are over the prospect of an early & victorious peace.  The flu seems to have got them all thinking far more than the war for people are dying like flies & so suddenly too.  Rich & poor go the same way, people are inclined to think it is some sort of plague.  In lots of towns they are dying far faster than they can be buried, so you can see its pretty serious.  A chap gets it this morning & hes dead the following day.  According to last nights paper the Government are going to take a hand in the matter, they have already released a lot of Drs. to help fight the disease.
