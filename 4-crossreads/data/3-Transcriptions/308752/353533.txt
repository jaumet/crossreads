<p>inhabitants, were exceptionally good to the men. One billet containing over 30 men were each given a cup of hot milk or coffee by the old madam of the house just before leaving. Considering the early hour which we left the place, 3 a.m. it was really a kind action. In fact it was a common occurrence all over the village, some of the old dames had a weep as we bid them Au revoir.</p>
<p>30th January 1918.<br/>Reveille at the early hour of 2 a.m. breakfast 2:30 a.m., fall in at 3:15 &amp; move off at 3:30 a.m. for --------- Railway station about 5 miles away. As it was moonlight the march was rather pleasant. Arrived at the station about 4:45 a.m. &amp; we were obliged to wait till 11 o'clock before we entrained. Along the road our kettledrumer was going his hardest,  it brought back recollections of those marches at Queens Park 29 long months ago. The trip in the train was rather pleasant as the weather has been very fine lately &amp; the country was beginning to look well. About 5 p.m. we passed through a fair sized town which I noticed was considerably knocked about since I saw it last, 15 months ago.  Dis-entrained about 6 o'clock &amp; marched to ----, our destination which turned out to be a big divisional Rest Station. It did not take the chaps long to turn in, as all were fairly tired after the long day.</p>
