<p>Dear Mum,<br/>I'm just writing a few lines while waiting for Dinner. I have been with Auntie since Thursday   &amp;  I'm going back tomorrow. I have had a glorious time. It is the 5th trip I've made to Manx Land. I don't care whether I see Scotland or Ireland. I hope to have a longer stay next time   &amp;  then visit Loxey, Snaefell   &amp;  Peel Castle. I met Mr C. L. Jones in London   &amp;  had a few words with him. It is lovely in July. The climate is quite mild. Marie   &amp;  Auntie   &amp;  I sat out in the apple orchard all yesterday afternoon. Primroses are very profuse here   &amp;   all sorts of mild bulb plants, Narcissi, Wild Hyacinth and daffodil etc. Well, I am Marie's off sider while on leave so I'll have to set the Table. I'll write at length when I get back to Bulford.  Love to all  Harry</p>
