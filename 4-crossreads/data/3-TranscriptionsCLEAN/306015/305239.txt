In the afternoon the Brigade (5th..) turned out in review order to be inspected etc by Mr. Holman (N.S.W.) & Genl. Birdwood, but the gentlemen failed to present themselves.  The unpleasant weather kept the thirteen inmates of our tent "indoors" during the evening.   Of course we were soon "in bed" for comfort's sake & spent the time singing.   Some of the boys sing well and Ron & "Birdy", especially, entertained us with good & sane pieces such as "Daddy" "Jerusalem" , and some of the well-known hymns.
Such hours are to me of more than normal interest.   Such tete-a-tete entertainments make one realise something of the infinite mystery & finesse of human sentiment & emotion  ......   As we finally -over to drop  When the sing-song ceased someone remarked "that's tres bon" & we all agreed in
