 [Tuesday 7 November 1916] 
 Our Skipper has just received a wireless message from the Admiralty thanking him for his Seamanship in bringing us through the storm at one time we were drifting very near to the French Coast- It is calmer today but a very high sea running. The Ship's order O.C. Troops thanked the men who worked in the stoke hold baleing all night &amp; then Captain of the day.  The Tommies are a big hearted crowd &amp;  the life in the troop deck is HELL, they have no room for exercise.
