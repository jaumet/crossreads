 1916   TUESDAY 20   JUNE 
 A fine warm day again  We were issued with our black kit bags for an hour in the morning. I put a lot of things out of my sea kit in to the black one & gave it back. We had a little physical culture in the morning under M r  Neylan. Bill Hunter & Self were down no 6 hold in afternoon looking for some harness. Something happened to the "Marathon" as she dropped right behind  They say she lost a propellar blade but I dont think thats the case. There is a wireless going round that we are goiong to Marseilles & I think there is a lot of truth in it myself.
