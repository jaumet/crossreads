 [Letter from fellow officer, 23/07/17.  Signature indecipherable] Dear Garling 
 I told you a few day ago that I had been experiencing considerable nervous strain and that I had put my case before the CRA.  Today I received instructions to proceed to England tomorrow, starting at an early hour.  Much as I would have liked to wish you and your battery goodbye &amp; good luck, I think it is best (for myself anyway) that I should go without ceremony.  I do not know at the moment what is to become of me in a military sense as D [indecipherable] [Drs?] have not informed me. 
 Will you please accept for yourself and convey to your battery my deepest gratitude for all that you and your officers and men have done for me during many trying and varied experiences.  Nobody better than myself realises the magnificent support I have always had from you under all circumstances. May you have the best of fortune in the future. 
 Yours Sincerely 
 [signature indecipherable]
