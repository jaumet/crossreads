<p>On Wednesday, 11th, we had about 3" of snow.<br/>On Thursday, 12/4/17, took guns up a couple of miles further. Got word to turn out at 6 p.m., during a heavy snow-storm. Succeeded in shifting guns and ammunition. While shifting the latter, the back of the wagon came open, unknown to us, and half of the shells dropped out. When we told the Major, he simply asked "Did any go off?" When told "No", he replied "It was lucky for you."<br/>On the way home, the mules just had the harness on, and we were riding one and leading the other, 8 mules altogether. As we were going through a field, riding at ease, i.e., reins hanging loose and feet out of stirrups, all of a sudden one of the mules took fright, probably at the noise of the shells bursting, and before we were aware of it, the whole eight had stampeded, and were dashing headlong across the field.<br/>Before going very far, my mule got tangled in some wire and came down, and I took a doubler over his head. I got up, but no one else was in sight, as it was pitch dark. I caught my two mules and, after a good deal of trouble, we all found one another again, arriving back at 2 next morning.<br/>On Friday, 13/4/17, we shifted our camp a couple of miles nearer the guns (Velu Wood, near Cambrai).<br/>On Saturday night we shifted the guns to a new position. Left at 4.30 p.m., and got back at 12 midnight.<br/>On Sunday morning, about 9 a.m., the Germans put a few shells near our horse lines. One landed about 20 yds. from</p>
