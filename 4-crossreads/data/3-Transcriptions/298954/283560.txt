<p>1918<br/>Thu. 17th Jan. (cont.)<br/>Also, many of the Japanese are in various stages of syphilis.   One half-rotten wretch was brought into the hospital today and occupies the next bed to me!</p>
<p>He is supposed to be quarantined but the "quarantine" consists of the Germans washing their hands whenever they touch him.</p>
<p>Another patient is my old pal, "Josh" (otherwise Cadet E.C. Cuthill.)   On Christmas day a cow and 3 pigs were killed &ndash; the prisoners got minute portions of the cow, dried potatoes and a kind of pinkish jelly.   The "jelly" was boiling hot when served out and as Josh was bringing a huge tinful along to this table he stumbled and fell down a companion-way.   He was severely burnt by the sticky mess but &ndash; worst of all &ndash; the table lost their Christmas "pudding".</p>
