<p>Tuesday 11 December</p>
<p>Fine but very cold.<br/>2 trips to 53rd Battn. in search of an R.C. Chaplain to come &amp; bury a body which is now lying at our M.D.S.<br/>A number of Spanish gentlemen called to have a look round our Dressing Station.  This being the first place a wounded man comes to from the line our visitors were deeply interested in the up-to-date conveniences we have here.<br/>General Birdwood passed by on another trip to the line.  He invariably wears the Aust. Hat, unlike other "heads" who prefer the red facings.<br/>Our guns nearby were very busy tonight and so was Fritz.  Many <u>Shells</u> came over<br/>5 p.m. Casualty wire.</p>
