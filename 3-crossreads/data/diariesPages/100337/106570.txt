throwing practice. Another man was shot through the arm while burning rubbish from around the camp, It seems that a live cartridge had found its way into the fire & exploded shooting this chap through the arm.

On the night of the 24th I walked into Wylye village to have a look round, I was unable to see much of the place, the night was too dark, But what I did see of it struck me to be very nice & it seemed to be very comfortable . It was very quiet & old fasioned, All street lights were extinguished owing to the fear of Zepplins.

To-day I went to the village of Codford, as there was no parades all day I was able to see the village in daylight, It did not strike me as being at all nice. It was very dirty & not so homely or as comfortable looking as Wylye. I strolled back to camp after a while & got caught in a storm on the way & wet through into the bargain.
