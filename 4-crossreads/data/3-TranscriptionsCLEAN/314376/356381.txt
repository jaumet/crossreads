  
 70 thing. We stopped here for about 8 days in all. I remember "Fritz" started to "straff" us one night, shells exploded over on the hills near by without doing much damage. We were ordered under cover and did not waste much time in getting in. 
 the order eventually came along for us to move up to the front line and we set off one dark night to the front line. 
 We had full packs up and it was a hard matter to find our way along in the darkness. I remember that Lieut Kennirs came along with us. I saw him the other day and he had both legs badly damaged, one seemed to be off. We were posted along the trenches. I had a funny feeling for a start
