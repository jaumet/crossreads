<p>March, 1916<br/>Thursday 16<br/>After the parade this morning I got two bundles of letters, one from Mum dated 4-1-16 which gave me some pleasant reading.<br/>After tea went &amp; played cards w/- dad &amp; had a long chat about the various things the letters brought up.</p>
<p>Friday 17<br/>Sent off a cable to be despatched to mum.  Every spare minute I get during the day I spend answering my letters.<br/>In the evening I went into Heliopolis to get my watch from the jeweller<br/>8 am to 1 pm on Abbassia Range</p>
