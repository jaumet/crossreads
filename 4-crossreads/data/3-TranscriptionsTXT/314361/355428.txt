The country is very beautifull again.Yesterday we went through Stere au Flos, Baraste, & Haplnicourt The ground in places looked like a beautiful carpet.June 6th 17Still in CampOn the night of the 4th an enemy aeroplane filed flew over the camp and dropped a bomb it just missed the lines by about a dozen yds, it dropped about 20 yds from me, expecting others to be dropped, it caused a great deal of commotion & nearly everyone ran out of the camp to the open ground, however he flew off, being afraid of the anti-air craft guns. There were five casualties three very slight, two were admitted to hospital.This morning the brigade has been on a long route march, was very fortunate on duty at phone.
