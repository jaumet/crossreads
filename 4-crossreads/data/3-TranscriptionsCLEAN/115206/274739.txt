Battery W.Lines. nr. Pont NoyellesWeather unsettled. Paid 100 Francs to-day. Played twoup and dropped the whole issue, as well as 50 others.Fritz plane fired one of our balloons, one observerparachute failed to open, but he fell on a tree and came out with a few scratches. The other chap landed in Bty W.Lines and had an explosive bullet drilledthrough his side. He seemed just about done when helanded. Met Gun Adam outside Querrie.
