 I was especially invited to stay in Manchester for Monday evening to go to a Coffee Meeting at the residence of Mr &amp; Mrs Cowell.  These coffee meetings were instituted 110 years ago by a Rev John Clewes &ndash; for 60 years a church of England minister at St Johns is M - &amp; although he was publicly known as such he was at least profoundly a Swedenborgian for he translated the greater party of his most important works &amp; instituted these meetings 'Theological' for the study of the works.  I felt it a priviledge &amp; rare opportunity to be in the midst of this circle of advanced thinkers.  The Host &amp; Hostess were charming elderly folk - first came on hand around delicious tea then the meeting began.  A paper was read by a Rev Ball on the Non-resistance of evils.  A discussion followed which was very interesting.  Yes, I loved being with these folk.  People with letters to their names and gifted people in different Arts are common amongst Mr B's Congregation.  Then there Mr Morriss &ndash; a Master of Chemistry who is making and supplying the dyes that were once imported from Germany.  My evening uniform is much admired &ndash; Sweet Grey Crepe-de Cheyne &ndash; Scarlet Satin Cape &amp; Soft white collar &amp; Cap. 
 27th  Twas good-bye to Mr &amp; Mrs Bulby the morning.  It seemed just a glimpse of renewed friendship and I was gone again. Only 2 more days &amp; They are spent with My curious David Gray &amp; he pretty &amp; charming daughter Millie at Waterloo &ndash; A Seaside Suburb of Liverpool I very much wanted to go to their home in the Isle-of-Man but time won't permit.  The first afternoon Millie &amp; I go into see the Art Gallery at L.  I love the A-Gallerys &amp; as L is the 2nd City in the Kingdom.  There are some fine pictures there.
