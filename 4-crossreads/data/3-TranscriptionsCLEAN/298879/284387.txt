  
 June 1915 Monday 7 Fine    Our platoon having a rest ahem!? We had to do all sorts of fatigues. I was mess orderly for the platoon & Orderly Room Orderly at the same time. Went back into fire trench in the evening. We always knock off work to carry bricks. I wrote one letter. 
 Tuesday 8 Fine. Our chaps attacked the Turks trenches on the left again and held them until 3 AM next day when they evacuated them. The attack was made to draw a large number of Turkish Rein. who were going to strengthen the right flank. Sergt Bramhall and two men went out on patrol and returned safely
