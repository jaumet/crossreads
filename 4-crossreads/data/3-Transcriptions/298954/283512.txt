<p>Mon.  20th Aug.<br/>The natives have been around in a few outriggers trading with the Germans.   (We are not allowed to approach the rails.   A sentry sees to that.)</p>
<p>The sight of the hun hogs wading into green coconuts and pineapples while we can only get a decent drink of water when it rains is sufficient to make us sweat blood.</p>
<p>It seems to rain regularly in this bay every afternoon about 2 pm.</p>
<p>The clouds collect in the hollow between the hills;  we have a drenching tropical downpour for about 10 minutes and then the sun comes out again.   The showers are very welcome for washing purposes:-  we save all the water we can in tin buckets.   The heat is terrific.   At night (we are still locked in the hold at sunset) our quarters are indescribable.</p>
