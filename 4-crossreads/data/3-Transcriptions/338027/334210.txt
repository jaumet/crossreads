<p>Thursday, 15 July, 1915<br/>All day leave we rowed ashore and although the day was hot, we spent an enjoyable day, visited the Chapel of Bones, Armoury took two of our siters to the Military Hospital where we saw some of our late patients.  Then we visited the Antonia [Antonio] Gardens at Birchercara, these are splendid all the earth has been carried there as Valetta is all solid rock, visited a fortress, saw a salute fired and spent an interesting day in the environs of Valetta.  Every body shows us kindness but they cannot understand the free &amp; easy Australians.  Returned to the boat and we sailed at five o'clock leaving a Corporal &amp; the Ships butcher on shore as they missed the boat.</p>
