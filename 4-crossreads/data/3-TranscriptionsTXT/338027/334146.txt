Tuesday, 9th March, 1915Big field day with the brigade and on a sham fight in the boiling heat and the desert hotter than hell, our horses had no water until they returned to camp in the evening.  Our division wore white hat bands and it was remarkable how this simple bit of color showed up from the Khaki.  During the fight we had to retreat and we were all blown up by the enemies artillery, if it was real it would have been good but as we crossed right in front of them.
The Allied fleet are still bombarding the Dardanelles with success, and I think we will occupy them before long.
Wednesday, 10th March, 1915Exercised horses as we do always when we are not on a field day.  The weather is typical of late of [indecipherable] hot, oppressive and hot gales of wind that cause the sand to fly and nearly blinds one & the horses too.  A third contingent has arrived at Alexandria and have gone to Mena.
Mail day to-day & I rec a lot of letters from Aust & home including one from my sister in which she states that she was robbed of her purse by a German but pluckily chased him & got it back, and the case was taken to court and was adjourned for 3 mos.  I am quite proud of my sister as I write this.
