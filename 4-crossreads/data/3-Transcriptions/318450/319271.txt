<p>we went to the main line.<strike>we</strike>  We traveled the most of the day before reaching the port of embarkation.</p>
<p>I may say about half way to this<strike>po</strike> port we were treated to a bun and also a lovely cup of tea provided by the Lord and Lady Mayoress of Exeter, and it was well appreciated by all as we were fairly hungry.  After leaving Exeter we saw some of the nicest scenery, I have seen since landing in England.  We would run along the coast and then run into a tunnel, and when you come out you are looking at the fresh green trees and the country houses.  We arrived at our destination about half past three in the afternoon of a bright Sunday</p>
