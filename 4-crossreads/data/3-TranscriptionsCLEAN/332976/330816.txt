  
 March 1917 18th.   This morning the whole section was taken off their old work, & with our infantry party, we were put onto making a rough roadway to bring the remainder of the guns up, & for "limber" & wagons traffic. This morning I went over to Les Boeufs & on to Le Transloy & the Sugar Mat to within a few hundred yards of Beulencourt.   The latter of these places a few days ago was well behind Fritz's lines.   The country is broken up a lot & in Le Transloy there are signs of many attempts by Fritz to burn the place down. There is a rumour at large that we are going to move forward any minute & that we are awaiting orders.
