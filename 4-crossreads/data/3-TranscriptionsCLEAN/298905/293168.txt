  
 to the train which was waiting for us, the carriage I got into I thought I had made a mistake at first, I could hardly believe that they were 3rd class carriages, they were got up so well the seats & backs are nicely padded & they have bonzer springs, in fact the whole get up of the compartment is nearly as good as the 1st class on the Australian Railways this might seem exaggerated but s   its true all the same, & although they travel very fast you can talk in the natural tone of voice & be heard quite distinctly, it took us 2 hours to travel from Folkestone to London 80 miles I think it is, the whole journey you pass through country very much like the South of France, & when you get into Kent there is nothing but hop fields & orchards all the way.
