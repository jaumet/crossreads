 letter of the end of July and beginning of August, from which I am very pleased to note you have got over your bad spell and were keeping well. &nbsp;You had a very cold snap there too, but now you will be over that and into the warmer weather. &nbsp;I hope you are looking after yourself O.K. &nbsp;I am glad to note you are going about and enjoying yourself, too. &nbsp;It pleases me to hear that Dad is well and bogging in as usual, besides Bess &amp; Lock. &nbsp;Bess&#39; exertions in the recruiting line will be about at an end now. &nbsp;I&#39;m O.K. 
 I suppost the butter shortage will be over now. &nbsp;I tasted the first bit of butter since I&#39;ve been back on leave, a few days ago. &nbsp;It&#39;s about 5/- a lb over here, and eggs are about 8d each. 
 Well, we&#39;re back in a feather-bed again and it is greatly appreciated, for it&#39;s refreshening up very much. &nbsp;We&#39;ve had a fair amount of rain too, which puts the camp underfoot mud. &nbsp;It is not as big a place as we were in rest last year, but it looks as if it will not be necessary to go up&nbsp;
