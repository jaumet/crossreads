 Don&#39;t post any more parcels. I hear that Demobilisation is to commence in February and it is hoped that all the Aussies will be home before 12 months have elapsed. &nbsp;I sent you one box of glassware which I hope will reach&nbsp;you safely. 
 1st Dec. 
 It has turned very cold so may snow shortly. &nbsp;Our wee mob is remaining here, whereas &#39;others have a good 100 kilos before them tomorrow. &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t fancy the trip. 
 Well I&#39;m quite OK. I have just been to our Railhead P.O. &amp; there are abouot 20 bags of letters &amp; parcels to be collected by our Postal Orderly which accounts for the non-arrived of our mails. 
 I hope you are all in the best of health and enjoying yourselves in the warm weather. &nbsp;Its not long now to Christmas, and we will all have a cheerier outlook before us this time. 
 Fondest love to Dad, Bess &amp; Mum 
 Your loving son,
