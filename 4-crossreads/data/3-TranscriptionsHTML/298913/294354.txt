<p>great size &amp; Cheops covers about 10 acres of ground &amp; is over 400 feet high &amp; over 3000 years old. The next striking sight to their siz  is the weather beaten state they are in. In places the rocks (2&frac12;' square blocks approx.) are loose &amp; have been misplaced.</p>
<p>The entrance to Cheops is in the centre of the nearest face to the tram. We did not go inside so cannot mention that yet. Many soldiers had climbed &amp; were climbing to the summit but, I did not feel quite strong enough. Camels &amp; donkeys &amp; Egyptians abound here, The latter pester one to death to come inside for "5 disasters". One can go inside for nix, &amp; instead of paying a guide, just hang on to the ones who do pay, it is just as good.</p>
