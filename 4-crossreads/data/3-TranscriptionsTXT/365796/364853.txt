 On Active Service 3/Sep/15. Dear Alan. I have no doubt that you will get to England. The Dardenelles must fall soon &amp; then our chaps will be in camp. Met some wounded N.S.W. boys in London. They make great chums with the wounded Canadian &amp; we had many a pot together. Met Bert Ratcliffe &amp; he took me to the Piccadilly hotel. Some place &ndash; he paid. England is worth breaking your neck to see. The girls have some complexions believe me
