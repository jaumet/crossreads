Dearest Mater Pater Stan Dora Marjorie Jack,
Once again we are in sight of the blue Mediterranean, on a huge ship ? I cant tell you why or whence we go ? Because ? you understand why ? But Im better again after the fever ? hospital I spoke of in my last, but still weak
Im mending am fairly tough. Sent you heaps of letters ? when Viva told me tells me every mail of non arrival it breaks my heart. Don't think I neglect you I never forget a mail when we are in camp.
Of course for a long while we were away in the desert but on return I always wrote to you. I don't suppose youll hear from me now for a few weeks ? the papers will tell you of our doings. 
I hope you got the parcel I sent to you also all my letters will turn up some day
