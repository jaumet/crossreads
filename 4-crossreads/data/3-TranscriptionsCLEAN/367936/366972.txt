  
 Tuesday 2 May 1916 Very rough today but does not affect me now I have got my sea legs.  It knocks the horses about a lot;  they lost 90 head one trip here. Had a medical inspection in afternoon.  This boat shifted some Indian troops before coming for us.  Hope they fumigated it well. 
 Wednesday 3 May 1916 Felt rather unwell in night (not sea-sickness) went to Dr. who painted my throat & gave me medicine. Three more horses died. I went on picquet from 6 p.m. to 10.  Saw light house on King George's sound in evening. Was put on carrying chaff to bins as I did not feel well enough for stables.
