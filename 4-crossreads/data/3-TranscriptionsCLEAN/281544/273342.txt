  
 the Main line at Wieltje which is practically on the top of Pilken Ridge, Wiltje has two Sidings, Merrytort & Ruby & the main line continues on for about 1/2 a Mile, we had to place a train load of Material  in there  at the head of the line during the night, after leaving Wiltje the line goes down hill through cuttings &  trench  past the Old German First line Trenches & pill boxes which are built of Concrete & by the Moonlight I could see that they had been knocked about a lot by our Big Guns. Owing to excavations going on at Wiltje Siding there were a horrible smell from the Dead Bodies of German's which had to be shifted. After compliting our Work we arrived back at Camp at 6 am & I was releived. 
 Sunday 21/10/17. I signed on again at 18 oclock & both Engines left at 20 oclock for St Jean but we did not have much to do, in the way of placing Material
