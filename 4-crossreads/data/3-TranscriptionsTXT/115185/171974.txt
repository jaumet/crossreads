15 - cousin sent out.They have gone out to Rhoda Island today the place where Moses is supposed to have been found. I would have gone if I'd been off duty.I do not feel these letters very interesting and also I feel my own daily doings so unimportant at this time of such great happenings to our empire and her soldiers - that I almost feel absurd recording them to the family. I hear very little war news. I received a letter from Capt Tyler of the Agamemnon from Malta. I will send it on to Mother. A patient of Sister Blundells was on the Canal and took a snap shot of the Cornwallis - & gave her a film - so I shall get it printed. Major Man is in Alexandria. He sent me a good photograph of himself.I have written other letters to both Mother & Father in Australia & to J R & G in England - this is just an account of what I've been doing for the Family.Your devoted daughter & sisterBetha McMillan
