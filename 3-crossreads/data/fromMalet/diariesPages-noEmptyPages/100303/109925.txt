The Boys
Heard on the march. Tune: "The Church's One Foundation"
We are the ragtime army
The A.N.Z.A.C.
We cannot shoot, we don't salute
No bloody good are we,
And when we get to Berlin
The Kaiser he will say,
"Hoch Hock bock boch
What a b--- rotten lot
Are the A.N.Z.A.C."!
Amen
The Brigadier issued some orders stressing the importance of pushing onwards in assault and never giving ground. He used these words and they were read out to the men on parade:- "If we go forward, we die. If we go backward we die. Better go forward and die!"
"Tucker" Vienna chips in, "Better be like b--- crabs and go sideways!"
Coming from away back to take part in the Battle of the Somme. As we approached the ominous roll of guns sounded, "What's that noise"? said a new chum. "Don't know", replied Gallipoli veteran, "think it's someone "playing marbles!"
