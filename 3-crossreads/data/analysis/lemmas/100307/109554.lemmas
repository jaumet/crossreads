 Pari 7/3/17 sheer beauti cannot be surpass . It remind me of the Chapel of Henri VII at Westminst Abbey . It is love and one mass of stain glass in the side high narrow window and in the altar end also . Above the door is a rose window . One is constant see wonder each of which surpass the other but this littl chapel is easili the best . The snow was now come down veri heavili so took the Metro back to the Opera ? excel clean train and neat dress peopl everywher . Wrote some letter and had 5 o'c tea with Mrs Enkenstein . The littl Rumanian tete-a-tet with a French offic so she could not join the parti wors luck .
