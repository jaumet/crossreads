 From the Thursday till Saturday it was not possible to do much except push forward one or two saps &amp; assembly trenches from our front line. The positions we occupied are rough shown in the sketch, our first position = A1, second - A2, third &ndash; A3 &amp; so on with the other companies. I do not know anything about the other battalions, in fact I saw little outside our company. During this period I saw a good deal of Arnold Hazlewood who was at the telephone with B Co., just adjoining us : later on, (Monday I think, he was badly wounded I heard). Owing to the shelling &amp; the cramped space this spell in supports was by no means comfortable, such details as washing &amp; shaving being of course out of the question. Fortunately the weather remained fine, tho' several times rain seemed to be working up. The ration parties &amp; water fatigues did good work &amp; kept us fairly well supplied : what did it matter if the water did taste of petrol owing to the carrying tins not having been properly emptied &amp; washed out!
