2enjoying a month's leave in London.Did you know his mother died in Feby? & poor little Betty's husband is fighting in East Africa. - Our B. Section moved off today I think for a place about 10 miles from a town with an almost unpronounceable name of 5 letters one of which is a vowel.We may follow at any time. - No 2 General is now at Marseilles. Did I wish you many happy returns of 29 Aug ? If not I do so now. - The clock has been put on an hour so as to agree with the English time, & it does seem so funny to have almost broad day light at 10 P.M. & even later. No news old girl but thought I would write you by this mail.Much love to you all fromYour ever loving brotherFred.
P.S. Don't send any more condensed milk dear for though I like it very much it is so heavy & now they are giving us tinned milkF.J.P.
