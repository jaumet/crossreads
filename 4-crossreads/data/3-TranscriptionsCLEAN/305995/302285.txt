  
 who is the "gamest" man who ever walked, gave orders for bearers & waggons to advance to the regiments late position & collect wounded. I shall never forget those twenty minutes that we spent collecting those men, as we were in the hottest region of the scrap with strays & shrapnel bursting like fun overhead. It was here that one of our boys was shot in the back & who has since been recommended for the D.C.M., not that he stood above others in his work, for only one could be mentioned & naturally it fell to the wounded man & none will begrudge him the honor. Our wounded were quickly evacuated to our base at Romani, but it was just as bad here as in the firing line; for Johnny was sending over high explosives from his six inch howitzer & our hospital was in constant danger for over twenty four hours while the bombardment lasted. Here I must mention the wonderful work that was being done by our Doctors in charge of the base. Over two hundred wounded passed through their hands in about nine hours & while some of them were busily engaged operating & amputating limbs, the others were dressing & consoling wounded.
