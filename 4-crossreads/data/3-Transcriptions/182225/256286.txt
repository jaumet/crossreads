<p>1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 16 &nbsp; JUNE</p>
<p>A fine warm day. The HMS &quot;Kent&quot; steamed up first&nbsp;at sunrise &amp; the band on the &quot;Marathon&quot; played the National Anthem. It looked all right, the 4 transports lying round the warship &amp; Table Mountain for a background. We weighed&nbsp;anchor about 11 AM and the &quot;Kent&quot; leading we steamed off two abreast the &quot;Benalla&quot; &amp; &quot;Beltana&quot; in front half a mile apart and the &quot;Argyallshire&quot; and &quot;Marathon&quot; a mile behind them. We are to keep that order I believe. I got a cable from Father today &quot;Had good rains Love&quot; and a note from the company to say that there was a cable waiting for me at the Post Office, Linda&#39;s I suppose. The fools ought to have had enough sense to send</p>
