  
 24 April, 1916 Anzac Sidings We were up at 5.0 am & formed a guard for Ammunition as we advanced along the line to the Rail Head, near there we met with what was left of the Gloueschester [Gloucestershire] Yeomanry - The rest had been captured by the Turks yesterday morning. We had to return & camp at the place with them as there was no water further on.  None of the horses had a drink except the officers,  I took my mare down & said she was an officers horse so she was dead lucky.  I had a quart of tea but was not able to fill my bottle after.
