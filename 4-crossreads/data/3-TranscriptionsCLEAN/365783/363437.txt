 No. 2 Gen Hosp. Mena 20.4.15 Dearest old Mrs, Your cable received re leaving by Warwickshire in 9 days time please let me know what port you disembark at & I will endeavour to get down to meet you.   We are not very busy just now & I think I can manage it.  As stated in my last letter you must be prepared at any time to hear of a change in our movements necessitating you cancelling your arrangements - I don't think it is likely to happen but it may.   There will be no difficulty in getting a house or flat but I will do nothing in the matter till you arrive.   Nestle's food can be procured without any difficulty & costs about 1/4 per tin.   There is only one variety to be had in Egypt - the label says "suitable for young children" apparently they do not have the under & over 6 months foods.   There are plenty of other foods if this is not suitable for the little man.  Bring plenty of money & get Arch to send more if necessary - I want you to live well over here. Please thank Trix for her letter of 1st inst. which arrived only yesterday nearly a week after yours of same date.   She should address her letters  properly .  No more time for any more news - feeling A1 & longing to see you all.   Best love from your loving husband Will
