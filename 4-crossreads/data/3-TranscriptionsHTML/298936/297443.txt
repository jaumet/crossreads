<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Thursday 14</p>
<p>Wood fatigue in camp [indecipherable] away ill.</p>
<p>Received letter &amp; birthday card from Rita letter from Woodlawn.</p>
<p>Hear we are going to England &ndash; just the usual rumour I suspect.</p>
<p>Wrote long letter to Rita.</p>
<p>Feel in very good health.</p>
<p>Had a good look around trenches yesterday &amp; saw Gun ridge which they say would finish the business if taken.  Seems an improbable task.</p>
<p>The line at Popes Hill on left is very near the Narrows &amp; surely we cannot keep getting across in time.</p>
