The whole scene is a riot of color , and the chant shanti of the labour as they did their round , harmonis with the babbl of the womenfolk , gave just the right touch of life to this interest littl pictur . About 5 mile from Yebna we drew into Deiran where the Desert Mount corp at present have their headquart . There is an extraordinari contrast between this pretti littl villag and the nativ villag through which we have been pass .

The street are well kept and avenu with Australian gum tree .
