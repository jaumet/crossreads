<p>42<br/>Monday 2nd Nov : At 4 o'clock this afternoon the Matunga cast off from the Depot wharf bound for Alexis Hafen. At the Flagstaff we hoisted D.J.X. (Au Revoir) and I had the gig manned to give them a parting cheer. As she moved off all the garrison cheered lustily &amp; the German residents turned out to bid God speed to some of their countrymen who were leaving for Rabaul. Several of the garrison also went thither having been found medically unfit for service. As she rounded Hospital Point my signalman semaphored "Good bye". This was acknged by dipping the ensign. After she had gone things again settled down to normal. The crew of the "Lili" are very much envied as they will have the pleasure of seeing her again at Alexis.<br/>Tues 3rd Nov 10.30 am : No! they won't! for at 9 o'clock this morning the "Matunga's" motor boat was sighted coming from the north. She had come with a message for the Major stating that Mr. Lucas, the representative for Burns Philp &amp; Co, had decided to proceed to Stephanorst after leaving Alexis as there was a large quantity of copra at that place awaiting transhipment. Consequently the motor boat will pick up the mails &amp; meet the "Matunga" off FdkWms Hafen as she steams southwards. Hard luck for us.<br/>6.30 pm (on board "Lili" off Breakfast Isd) : New Guinea is a place where everything is topsy turvy. Even the lizards walk on the ceiling, which of course has nothing to do with the present position of the "Lili".<br/>We have heard that a steamboat of some size is concealed in a creek about 40 miles N.W. of Madang. The "Lili" is too small of carry more than 15 men &amp; as we require a larger vessel for visiting distant points I have obtained permission to search for it &amp; cut it out. All other arrangements (for us) have accordingly been cancelled &amp; here we are with 5 days provisions &amp; 13 rifles, also 1 AMC private. The "Matunga" left Alexis about &frac12; an hour ago &amp; we should shortly see her steaming lights to the S.E. It is my intention to weigh anchor at midnight and make our way northward.<br/>Wed 4th : At 12 o'clock last night half the hands were called</p>
