March 19179th.   I continued with my same job today & have made considerable progress with the consolidation of Bull's Eye dugouts.  Fritz shelled us heavy this morning & again this evening.   The weather has been very cold, but the sky is clear & Fritz's observation over our lines has been at its best.At about 3 P.M. it started to snow again, & continued through the night.10th.   We had more snow this morning but the sky cleared up about noon & about 3 P.M. Fritz opened up heavily onto "Needle Dump."  We received the news to-day that Count Zeplin died, the day before yesterday.
