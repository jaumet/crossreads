<p>2 June, 1916 Friday</p>
<p>Reveille at 5</p>
<p>Our new CO hove on the skyline today, he is out of the R.E  &amp; is quite a nice bird although rather childish but with education will prove OK. he is no horseman &amp; I took him round all the posts in the afternoon up to Katis Gannet, first where we raised Pt Said at one time yo Helio Stns were calling us &amp; heaps of other work. Three of our planes with 12 bombs each went out at nine &amp; gave the Turkish camps what oh, all returned safely, they have got two battle planes at Kantara mounting 3 guns each &amp; theres rumor of Samson coming out to take charge of them if he does we can look forward to good results from the R.F.C. Rogers came back from Pt Said where he left the boss.</p>
