  
 13.5.15 right on top of the hill opposite killing one man & wounding several others.  At 11 oclock we came on to take up positions in the trenches to relieve the 13th Btn.  Penny, Smithers & I were placed in a dug out on the end of a field telephone & soon were quite comfortable & as safe as it is possible to be.  Macdonald of the machine gun section was hit in the leg this morning by a bullet.  After tea the Turks kicked up a hell of a row with machine guns & rifles, but did no damage.  Smithers, Penny & I are taking 2 hour shifts on the phone during the night.  Soon after nine oclock the Turks threw some rockets amongst us to see what we were up to & gave Penny who was on duty a bit of a shock.
