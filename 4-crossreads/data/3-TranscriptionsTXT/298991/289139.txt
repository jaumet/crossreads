Friday February 2ndOwing to the kitchen being shifted this afternoon everything was head over heels. Everything was very quiet during the day. A German airoplane came over this evening & dropped two bombs not too far away, close engh for my liking.
Saturday February 3rdHad a quiet morning, but was kept exceptionally busy this evening. We put through about seventy patients in about two hours, including 22 Scoties. There were four of the Scoties severly & dangerously wounded, it appears that two Coys were carrying "Mills bombs" in sand back, when the pin came out of a bomb & set the rest off. One was blown to pieces (he was due for a months furlough tomorrow through long service). The weather is getting much warmer, & the starlings are beginning to arriving here in mobs too, a good sign of spring. There was a concert & a bit of a cinema held in the recreation hut tonight. I did not go.
Sunday February 4thEach day that passes spring is noticeably coming very quick. Rather quiet all day. All stretcher cases (wounded) go right on to the Casualty clearing station, both by Railway & motor, this means less work for us C section of this ambulance & four out of a section had to go up to the Advance dressing station as reserve bearers for the stunt tonight. The 13th Battalion went over at 9 pm & took their objective. The prisoners are said to have given themselves up very easily, some even had their blankets & overcoats rolled waiting to go over & meet our fellows to give themselves up, they declared they knew we were going to have a pop over, but did not know the time, & that they were utterly sick of the war, in all about 250 prisoners were taken. Both the 13th & 14th Battalions lost heavily through the German shell fire. Keeping very cold. Shifted into another tent in the opposite corner of the camp very convenient place.
