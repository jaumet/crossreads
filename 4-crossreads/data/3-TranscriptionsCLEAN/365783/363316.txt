On one of the decks a boxing ring has been fixed up & every afternoon at six some ding dong battles take place.   We have not yet had a fan installed in our cabin, apparently the one belonging to the cabin is broken beyond repair & there are no spare ones on the ship.   I have already had proof ample of the value of giving tips all round at the commencement of the voyage.   Bath towels at the present moment are at a premium, each officer is allowed one coarse towel every other day.   The bath steward informed me of this & at the same time winked his eye & advised me that as far as I was concerned the rule could be disregarded as he would see that both a face towel & a soft body towel would be available for me each morning.   Bang goes another ten bob.    The pound that I bestowed on the table steward fell I fear on rocky ground - he is very willing but very stupid.   The pourboire to Lance Corp. Winter was quite unnecessary - he is at all time & under all conditions as a batman a perfect admirable Crichton.    The drink steward is next to useless, there is only one man to attend to the drinks of the whole saloon
