<p>(11).</p>
<p>was in no way due to the War (Oh no!) but was caused through the</p>
<p>failure of the wheat crop in some out-of-the-way province in Canada!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At Waterloo and in fact at all the terminal stations,</p>
<p>hundreds of women collect and pelt flowers at the wounded as they are</p>
<p>carried into the waiting ambulances.&nbsp; That they cannot find some</p>
<p>more tangible way of helping the war along seems a pity as I feel</p>
<p>sure they only come out of idle curiosity, the same as would attract</p>
<p>them round a street accident.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last stage of my journey was by ambulance to Wandsworth</p>
<p>- No.3 General Hospital - a distance of about 7 miles out, where I</p>
<p>was to cease my wanderings for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot to mention that whilst at Southampton I picked</p>
<p>up a &quot;London Daily Chronicle&quot; of 1st. August which had this one and</p>
<p>only piece of cable news from Australia:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;with tremendous whiskers and hair hanging down</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his back another &quot;wild white man&quot; has been</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; captured east of Lindenow (Victoria) where he</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; had been a terror to the women and children of</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the neighbourhood&quot;.</p>
<p>and I make no comment on it, except that it looks very much like the</p>
<p>Sydney Bulletin&#39;s style.</p>
