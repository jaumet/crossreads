<p>had a few cases full. Work until 4.30 pm when the last has been sent to the station, guard placed &amp;  we leave for Alexandria to-morrow night. Getting kits packed &amp; various other duties, also a few good-byes until 11-30 pm. The excitement of the unexpected leave prevents much sleep</p>
<p>9th July:- Sunday<br/>To-day is the day &amp;  it is hot too. About 101&deg; . Parade in full marching order at 6.30 am &amp; inspection follows. The rest of the day is taken up with doing odd jobs. Parade at 2.30 pm &amp; at 10 pm we again fall in, parade &amp; dismiss to again; parade at Cairo station at 10.30 pm. This is an awfully messed up affair. Talk about hot. With full marching kit (heavy enough) &amp; two large full bags, we march &amp; tramp about, haul all this</p>
