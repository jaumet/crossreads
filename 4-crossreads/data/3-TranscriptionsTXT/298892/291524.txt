I have arranged to do so several times but have failed to keep the appointments sometimes through accident but more often by design. He is a most peculiar individual and is impossible to shake off. It appears that he has just passed his intermediate. He was armed with a paper containing the results when he first visited me. He came last on the list but was very elated at passing. Let me know whether you know anything of him and whether I must submit to his approaches. I received a note from Dr. Graham informing me he knew Dr. Rosenthal. I will reply to it at the first available opportunity. Dr. Rosenthal is the Medical Officer attached to this Battalion and is to go to the front with it, but is the Junior Medical Officer in the Camp at present. Capt. Hogg (Dr.) being the Senior Medical Officer. A Dr. Paten is also stationed here at present but he is merely awaiting orders to attend at certain recruiting centres. So Kevin is back home again at last. You must be overjoyed to see him again. I was hoping to be able to run home from here for a week-end. I would have to get a couple of extra days leave but when we have coped with the present epidemic I may be able to manage it.
