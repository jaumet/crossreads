 W.G. to Genl. Sir John Monash 
 Dear Sir Your reply to my letter of 22nd Inst. reached me today and it only remains for me to thank you for explaining why the engagement of 5th April /18 was called the battle of Derencourt and the connection of the village of Millencourt therewith &ndash; and for your sympathetic reference to my son.  May I tell you how deeply it is appreciated &ndash; this part of my message now to you Mrs Garling asks to be allowed to share with me. Yours Sincerely WNG
