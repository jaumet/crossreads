<p>14/1/16<br/>The train came into big station which reminded me of Princes Bridge but Lord, how much more magnificent. Glass roof Moorish architecture, an ornamental clock and a general fine look. A buffet and shops. Noticed the dead end was furnished with big hydraulic buffers. A hospital train was in white carriages painted with a crescent and a star upon them. The ordinary carriages are differentiated in their classes by Roman numerals I, II, III,.</p>
<p>Outside the station hailed a gharry, observing drinking water divided into two classes British &amp; Indian. Now that living picture which is Cairo began to unfold itself before our eyes a carnival of colour, the bread sellers with their rings of bread on their arms the sweetmeat sellers, vendors of canes sellers of cloth &amp;c, and with all that quaint smell which is peculiar to Cairo a perfume that speaks of romance and filthy, ecstatic pleasure dreadful pain &amp; disease. The natives have nearly all a small tatoo mark or two above the temple and the faces of many are cicatriced with slashes lengthwise and across usually on one cheek only. Some men wearing an ear ring through the top of the ear. Sugarcane abundant everyone biting strips off and sucking them "Boots a clean Post a cart".</p>
