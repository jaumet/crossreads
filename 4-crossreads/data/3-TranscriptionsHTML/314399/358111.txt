<p>Thursday 24 April 1919<br/>Gee my valise is some size. Still everything is in. Got a lorry for the valise. Going down to the quay had a fight with a frog cos he wouldn't let us go over a bridge before him. Tried to bluff him first but it wasn't any good so hit him. He kicked me then as I did the same. About 20 others closed in behind me but Parry hopped out too. Got the second mates cabin for 10/-. Went to be at 6.30 pm.</p>
<p>Friday 25 April 1919<br/>ANZAC DAY</p>
<p>Off the boat at 9. Sent all the wires &amp; wandered around till 11.30 when I met my girl. Went to big [indecipherable] Road had dinner &amp; then wandered thro' the forest. Caught the 4.54 pm train to town. Had dinner at the station &amp; then came to Jermyn Court.  Got a bonny room. Rang Janet up. She said Marie was home so rang Marie up &amp; then went out there &amp; met Bill. Janet followed so we had a good old meeting. Put them on a bus &amp; a train &amp; then got the tube home. Have to report in the morning.<br/>The diggers marched thro town this morning &amp; put up a bonny show.</p>
