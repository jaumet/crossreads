<p>It is not so long ago, about four months, that I saw your people, and letters tell me how very good Mrs Cuthbert was to poor old mother when the news came thro. And now your dear mater will herself be in grief. God gives all the consolation possible. I had written to hereafter receiving from headquarters London, a letter stating Nim had been wounded, but of course never dreamt of his death. Well old chap, it's no good me trying to write my feelings. Your greatest consolation in this wilderness, &amp; amid a dearth of mutual friends, must be the glorious fact that he died doing his duty, and, as a soldier, you must be proud beyond words of him, and honour him for his sacrifice. I will certainly, if ever the opportunity offers, visit his grave. Thank you very much for trying to locate Alan's, its one of my chief aims. I may join the 3rd Btn (as a private) before you get this even. And now old pal good bye, &amp; the best of everything to you consolation on your bereavement<br/>Yours<br/>Dene</p>
