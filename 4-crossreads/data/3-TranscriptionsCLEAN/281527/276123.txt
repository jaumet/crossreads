At 9.30 met General Smythes staff at Le Grand Bois and did a staff ride going over the same ground as yesterday. The day was blustery and cold and most unpleasant. Went over the ground with Sellick and wrote the orders in conjunction with the 5th Bde staff in a billet of the French Mortars. After a bite of sandwiches rode up to the Wood & Chateau with General Smythe who rides daredevil fashion and at breakneck speed. From here we rode back along a high ridge with a great panorama stretching in both directions. Little farms, ploughed fields and cultivations lay below like a chessboard. An interesting and instructive day & educative for the Staff as well as others
