 Friday 26th January All leave is now cancelled, reasons not stated. I suppose it will only be for a week or two. It was terrific cold here today, with a strong wind blowing. I haven't  a bad job at the Buffet. 
 Saturday 27th January It is still very cold with the northerly wind blowing. There is a fellow who plays the violin in our tent, so we have some music & a sing song nearly every evening. It helps to pass away the time. Sounds of a very heavy bombardment from early in the morning until well into the day, no word of any attack yet though. We were very much rushed with patients last night, 78 being put through in a couple of hours. Word has just come through that the 29th Division went over last night, took 2 lines of trenches & 600 prisoners. 
 Sunday 28th January We are getting very poor food here & C. Section paraded to the O.C. who said that the bacon was to be fried instead of boiled & we are to receive porridge three times a week. Previously we only got cold boiled bacon & tea for breakfast, stew & tea for dinner, rice or sago & tea for tea. Dry rations consisted of bread, jam, cheese, & sometimes butter, which is no good for such a cold climate as this. As all the water pipes are frozen, water is now very scarce, & through the shortage I haven't anything to do, but was put on undressing a dead man & sewing him up in a blanket, & watching over two more who were dying, one was gassed & the other two were badly knocked about. We have braziers burning in the tents here & get very black from the coal smoke.
