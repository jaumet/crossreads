23rd Good news from Palestine this morning once again the "Aussies" are in the limelight theres scarcely a day passes without them being mentioned somewhere or other.
Got a letter from Len today saying that he would probably be going home to "Aussie" by the end of the month, he's lucky enough for anything all I hope is that he gets away, I am making every effort now to get back to the Batt. for I would get mine right off. Went over to the OTB. this morning evening while there a big argument rose as to when certain units were entitled to put their chevrons up it ended in a bet I am holding the money also wrote to Horsferry Rd to have it settled.
24th. Bright lovely morning but the afternoon has been a failure
