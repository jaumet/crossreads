 The Rafa Raid El Arish Midnight, Jan. 11th 1917 We have just returned to camp.  A most curious affair from our point of view.  But I am too tired to write tonight, &amp; sleep too precious so I will report it in the morning. 
 Jan. 12th Soon after the guns started to fire, we found that the turks' artillery consisted in a battery of mountain guns with which they did very little &amp; pretty bad shooting.  The Turks were esconsed in trenches &amp; redoubts along a fairly high ridge.  A very strong position as the ground sloped gently for about two miles in front of the ridge containing not a single inch of cover.  At about 10 a.m. the whole brigade opened out &amp; advanced at the trot extended along this open ground;  reached to within about a mile of the redoubts &amp; then dismounted &amp; the horses were taken well back.
