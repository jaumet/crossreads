 the building of Stone, many storied, much windowed, is in first class order suggesting neatness and education of those upon whom responsibility falls for maintenance in both painting and decorating, these showing to advantage the architectural characteristics.

Many other private houses bespeak, from the outside, much wealth while the gardens indicate the tastes of the owner. 
 Here and there green spaces, recreation grounds, golf links, point to joint action on the part of the residents for common good.   The asphalts roads, the side walks, the shops, the electric lighting, the street lamps, the trees, are of high degree in perfection, as becomes the luxurious.  Were these set out otherwhere than with the dessert as a boundry all would be satisfactory. 
 Today is Saturday.   In good health but in not in good writing fettle this week. 
 11-30 a.m. a copy of the Catholic Press of date 1-4-15 has just come to hand.   Who sent it?   The address was C/o A. G., London, but it must have come direct, there has not been time to reach England &amp; return to here.   I did not find a paragraph marked for me to read.   No other papers have reached me of late. 
 I saw an account of the Norris Lane Mullins wedding.   A lenten affair which went off well.   Good luck to them! 
 To my friends please convey my best wishes and regards. To yourselves Heaps of love &amp; loads of Kisses from your loving and afft faree John B. Nash
