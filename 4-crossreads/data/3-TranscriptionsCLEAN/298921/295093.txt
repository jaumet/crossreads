April, 1915Friday 30On Board of Inquiry today & very hot in the Tent it was -Afternoon visited our sick & wounded at Heliopolis Hospital - some grand work was done but you must wait for details. Whether this is all to be destroyed by Censor often makes me regret the time spent in writing we have so little time to ourselves for writing it seems a pity if all for nothing & if I knew definitely I would not post but hold till war is over.
