  
 18.8.15 Wed. 18th.  One of the Lenster boys was shot dead through a loop-hole at Quinn's last night;  by finding men for outpost duty at Hintons Post & at the end of this gully & at the Bloody Angle, together with fatigues during the day time our Regt. is getting an exceptionally hard time just at present, & every day there is a sick man or two sent away, there are not many of old lads left & what are left have nearly all been sick & are run down & should be sent away for a spell, but all the posts around Monash Gully are rather weak & it would be very risky to weaken it further by sending anyone away that is still strong enough to show fight, we are also on a better diet again rice & desicated vegetables being issued to-day, also a ration of coffee, but I believe we get no more coffee.
