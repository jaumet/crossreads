<p>2<br/>ants, that are annoying me especially on my scalp , which is exposed more than usual &ndash; as yesterday I had my hair cut a la convict. I have written to Miss Rossitter &amp; asked her to send me a book which I left <strike>there</strike> at "Dene Place" entitled "Diseases of Horses &amp; Cattle". It seems such an awful waste of the valuable years of one's life here that I mean to try &amp; minimise the after effect by studying something which may be useful to me after it is all over (if I am spared) should I decide to try &amp; make my living out of the City &ndash;<br/>I Mean to write to Mr Manniton of W.A. &amp; ask his advice with reference to any thing which may be useful for me to study</p>
