<p>pack Kits &ndash; leave ground clear of debris, it is a sin to see what we have to burn as it is too much to carry, only allowed issue. Yesterday it was very funny &ndash; as the lads are stoney, they were auctioning things to the highest bidder &ndash; Boots, Hats &ndash; Curious, Keepsakes, etc. I was orderly Corporal &amp; needless to add I wasn't an important person, only wanted at once in about six places. Had breakfast or rather Bully Beef &amp; Biscuits &amp; Tea at 6 am.</p>
<p>Has the Camp as clean as a new Pin &ndash; all rubbish burnt, all Kits, tents, etc, packed ready for A.S.C Waggons, we moved off at 8.30 am with water bottles filled &ndash; sea Kits &amp; Blankets, no rations issued. Marched to Zeitouin siding where a very cheap looking train was waiting</p>
