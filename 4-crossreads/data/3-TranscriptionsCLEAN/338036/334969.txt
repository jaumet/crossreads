  
 [16th Oct. contd] advised travelling back by 8.0 train from Abbeville.  In the meantime I could have a look round & finding the YMCA I left my coat & proceeded to investigate the place.  The Abbey & Cathedral are excellent buildings.  The town was quite busy - many civilians were shopping etc.  The river Somme runs thro the town & at this point is very pretty.  Called at YMCA again at 7.0 & caught the 8.0 pm train from Abbeville to Noyelles - changed - thence to Cayeax & from there I stumped it back to Camp.  Reported at guard room. 
 Wednesday 17th Had to appear before the beak this morning for returning after lights out but on explanation the case was dismissed.   Cinema at night "Lucille Love". 
 Thursday 18th Jig saw puzzles.  These things are quite the rage now in some recreation rooms. 
 Friday 19th Anniversary of 25th birthday. 
 Friday 19th At night a French Concert party entertained us - one girl being from a Paris Opera Co.  Excellent violinist with the crew named M. Duskin.  Pleasant evenings entertainment.  In the afternoon the band preceded us in a route march thro the village of New Brighton & being a sunny afternoon it was enjoyable.
