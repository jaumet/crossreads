<p>to the proper trench where we had a feed &amp; drop of rum &amp; then a good sleep, but was on duty in the Trench soon after I woke up.  We had 24 hours in the trench then doing ordinary trench work such as patrols sentry duties &amp; then when our turn came again to go out, this time besides the 4  men I had to take out 2 men with a stretcher to bring in the body of a Captain on the staff who had got shot through both eyes at 3.30 pm in the afternoon.</p>
<p>It seems that this captain made his way along the flooded trench &amp; must have been seen by the Huns as when he made his way to where my post was he said to the sergeant that he did not think there were many Huns in front, but the sergeant warned him that there was a sniper on the right &amp; another sniper on the left &amp; not to look over in the day time. <br/>but however he did look over &amp; got a bullet through both eyes, they put him on a waterproof sheet but he died in agony at 6.30 pm so the two extra men I took out &amp; the party going out which I relieved at 8 pm took his body back &amp; it went to Head Quarters.</p>
<p>A poor chap of the 20th Batt: laid out in the open dead, no one thought of bringing his body in, although we went close to where he lay as he was coming in when a sniper got him &amp; we had to pass the body each time we went either out or coming back, but everybody was in such a pitiful state of wet &amp; cold that these sort of things are excusable as the men were utterly exhausted &amp; some had bad trench feet one chap going out the first time lost his rubber boots as he got bogged &amp; could not free himself so he had to pull his</p>
