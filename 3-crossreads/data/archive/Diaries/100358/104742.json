I was working all day, on aerial observation and dugout fatigue ? Fritz had got in a lucky one on several of our exposed dugouts ? and was feeling tired before we started.  At 2 am we fell out.  It was raining and bitterly cold.  We waded along the sunken road to Flers, and gingerly picked our way amongst the ruins of that village to a protected cellar where our cookers were.  Here we found 8 food containers, 4 tea, &amp; 4 stew.  These are huge thermos flasks about 2 feet by 15 inches and oval in section.

He took a spell, and I picked the path and helped him out of muddy places.
