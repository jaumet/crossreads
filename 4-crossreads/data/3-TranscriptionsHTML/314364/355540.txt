<p>Sun.Feb.2.<br/>Glory: Alleluia. After dinner today I was lying down on my Bunk, when "Lippy" came up from the Store &amp; said ,<u>"Eh: Moorey, you are on the ship's staff of the Lancashire &amp; you are to report to the Orderly Room at 9 in the morning."</u>  At first I thought he was only kidding , but he said it was right. I returned to my Hut &amp; tried to realise that I <u>was</u> actually on a Boat Roll, but I'm hanged if I can. The very idea of being back with my dear old B.E. again is a very hard thing to realise considering it has been the main object in my mind since last Xmas 18 months. Anyhow, after a while I managed to pull myself together &amp; went for a Bath &amp; donned a clean change. I ought to have written some letters after Tea, but I felt too bloomin' excited to do anything. Its no use me writing any more letters to B.E. or any of 'em at Home, as I shall be there as soon as they would.<br/>Last night I had a shave &amp; put all my Gear ready fr getting away this morning. Reported to orderly Room at 9 with Sgt Cropley who is also on "Lancashire's" staff. Said "Goodbye" to the crowd in Hut 80 &amp; "Mac" "Andy" &amp; "Lippy" in the Q.M. Store. Got a ride over to Monte Video in a Car. Here we reported ourselves &amp; were allotted to Hut no 9.  Saw Archie Deed &amp; had a great old yarn with him. He is doing a bit on the Educational Staff in Camp so I guess it will be some time before he gets away on a Boat. Also saw Claude Holland, who was carrying with us at Ypres the day I got a [indecipherable]. He was a patient in Hosp. (but did not appear to have much the matter with him. After Dinner Sgt Cropley, Archie Deed &amp; I went to see "The Big Roan" who is in Hospital here recovering from the affects of an operation for appendicitis. He was quite pleased to see us &amp; we stayed yarning for nearly an hour.</p>
