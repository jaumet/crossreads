About 8pm orders arrived for all the survivors of the Brigade to be organized into a composite battalion with myself as C.O. and Stewart as Adjt. Each company to be fully organized and to have 8 Lewis guns. Arranged these details with Colonels Bateman and Forbes and established a headquarters near Brigade H.Q.  At 3.45 am the 1st Bde and the 2nd Gordons are to hop over into Bullecourt making the third effort to capture the place. We act as reserve in this road and are to be ready to move up to the railway embankment if necessary. The evening was bright moonlight and some heavy shelling filled the air with phosphoric dust. There seemed to be a lot of Highlanders and R.G.s about and a good deal of transport. The "Frightfulness" detachment of the R.G. lost their way and drove their G.S. wagons of ammonal out into No Mans Land. The Huns spotted them and started shelling with heavy crumps at last exploding the whole thing  killing about 60. a horrible sight mangled meat and limbs everywhere strewed the ground. Our doctor went forward & some stretcher bearers
