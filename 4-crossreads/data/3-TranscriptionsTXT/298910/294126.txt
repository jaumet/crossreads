 Cold &amp; drizzling rain. Very few casualtys. One of our observation Balloons bombed by Fritzs Aeroplanes &amp; came down in flames quite near us. It was a very smart bit of work, speaking without prejudice 
 Sunday  1/4/17 
 Dull day &ndash; Few casualtys through the day. Two more of our Balloons brought down in flames in our sector. Got orders at midnight to attach ourselves to Dr. Elliott &amp; the 56th Battalion as there is to be a stunt at daylight -. We marched out with the 56th at &frac14; to one o'clock &amp; took post in a sunken road, up to our knees in mud &amp; water &amp; as cold as possible &ndash; we were just behind the firing line &ndash; not allowed to make any noise, strike matches, etc &ndash; just shiver till daylight, some of us made little bits of shelter in the bank to get away from the wind &ndash; We will probably have to act as Regimental stretcher bearers, personally I am quite resigned to act in any capacity &amp; only too pleased to go forward with the boys. Bob Windsor, Adrian Feint &amp; myself if anything should happen, have mutually agreed to look after any personal effects. Luckily feeling pretty fit &amp; not a bit nervy &ndash; The next few days
