  
 August 2.8.15 Mon. 2nd.  Major Vernon has been away for several days now sick;  the Reg. Quarter M. Sergeant-Major (Webb) has also been away for over a week.  We are on a short allowance of water only 11/2 bottles allowed per man to-day.  Went for a dip after tea. 
 3.8.15 Tue. 3rd.  Last night Gurkhas were landed here.  We relieved the men on the 'Phone at dinner time, but were relieved ourselves at 4 oclock as the 1st Regt. moved onto Pope's Hill & went in the trenches, A Sqd. took over the 'Phone, so we made a dug out comfortable & put the rest of the afternoon in reading the papers, as the papers of the last mail only arrived to-day.  About 9.30 to-night we gave the Turks a demonstration.  Signal fires burning green & red smoke was lighted on Walkers Ridge, also red & blue parachute flares were fired.  These flares are in a class of their own here they are fired high in the air by a gun & descend very slow, lighting up the country as plain as day.
