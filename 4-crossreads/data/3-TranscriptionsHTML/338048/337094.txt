<p>For the four days we were at Cape Town we were ashore on marches each day &amp; so had good advantage of the change afforded by being in port. The fact that Tommies who were here for an afternoon &amp; the Portugese had leave while we did not hurt somewhat but we saw a good bit of Cape Town and had a good change. The people were very hospitable and a good deal of fun was always about when we marched through the Streets. Of ourselves we made a great impression. The man in charge of the police was greatly surprised when he was informed that we were not permament troops and a "thorough lot of gentlemen" was the type of criticism which we received.</p>
<p>Cape Town has the appearance of being well looked after the road around the Devils Peak which goes right round &amp; comes out around the Lions Head showing that Tourist traffic is well cared for. The port is good and appears busier that Port Melbourne which has the "Yarra" to take away all but the largest of ships. The shipping portion is like a corner of the bay (bigger that Hobsons) with a pier pretty well right around &amp; jetties jutting in every where &amp; little channels leading off here &amp; there providing berths. The blacks are amusing &amp; strong. <strike>About</strike> Three or four woman with big bundles of sticks (about 8' x 3' x 3') on their heads passed us one time. The children are dirty &amp; even when <strike>very</strike> about 13 appear to be inverate [inveterate] smokers &amp; gamblers.</p>
<p>Friday 23rd<br/>Fine day, calm sea with good swell. Medic &amp; Demosthenes are in front and Warilda &amp; we follow advancing in twos. The Laconia is generally in the centre working up &amp; down. The Warilda has been dragging behind &amp; the pace of the other boats has had to be reduced.</p>
