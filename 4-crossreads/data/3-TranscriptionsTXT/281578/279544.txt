latter is a one star artist named Smith, who has just got his com. Sgt. Dwyer, platoon sgt. turned into his dugout feeling crook, so I showed the new cove over our section of the trench. Found out yarning to him he was in the same officers' school as Dad Ryan & Clarrie Hall. A young American soldier (NCO) was brought to our platoon tonight, a few of them have come up for experience of the trenches, before their huge armies come in to finish the Hun. I could hardly talk to him for laughing, I had heard coves on the stage taking off Yanks, & it seemed funny to hear this chap talking in the same strain seriously. He said to me "We're keen to be right in it, we've got a fine lot of young guys." I asked him what the general opinion was in America about the war, & he said the 'opinion is we'll whip em right soon." The poor Yank didn't have a very nice night for a start, as it was raining, & very mucky under foot. We had no pozzy for him to sleep in tomorrow, so he'll have to dig himself one. Our platoon is only 22 strong. A listening post & digging jobs used up all bar the No 1 & & 2 of the Lewis gun in the trench, so if Fritz only knew
