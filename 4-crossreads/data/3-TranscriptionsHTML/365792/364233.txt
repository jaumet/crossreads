<p>May 29 long ramble too, &amp; although its dead quiet one doesn't mind that in the least. It's a relief too to get away from the squabbling of the Tommies &amp; all the red tape.</p>
<p>30 Slept real well after a good shower last night. Pratted my frame through the door &amp; got a job. You bet I handled that mop to some purpose. First came the brush on a long handle then two rubber scrapers &ndash; also on long handles &amp; last of all the mop. Each bucket of water was diluted with fenile, &amp; we did the job in no time.<br/>Played croquet nearly all the afternoon, but was licked 2 out 3 times. Jolly good games they were too. Slight rain but nothing to speak of. Wrote several letters &ndash; incl one for another chap. Everything one wants here, Library, Billiards &amp; Concert Rooms, Canteen Croquet Lawn, Red x store etc.</p>
<p>31 Dodged toil this mng, &amp; went for a bit of a stroll round the grounds</p>
