<p>allowed to stay another winter in France.</p>
<p>Poor old Kelly is very lonely   &amp;  miserable at No. 3 A.G.H.   &amp;  I think she was very foolish not to have stayed here. Her sweetheart has been wounded again   &amp;  is also sick, in No. 14.A. Gen. H. Egypt. If he gets to London  they will get married   &amp;  if he is sent to Aust. Kelly will get out there. I wonder how much longer this awful war will last.</p>
<p>When I return I shall need a new Cabin-trunk, so if I could get another one at warehouse I should be pleased &ndash; My old one will just see me home &ndash; so if you get an opportunity of getting it for me, do so. I want a strong one, like the one I've got. I shall not be long home, perhaps 10 days but maybe more, so must do</p>
