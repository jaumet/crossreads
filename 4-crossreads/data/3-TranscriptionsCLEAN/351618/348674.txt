  
 little nook in the rocky Hills. The rocks were all colored & interspersed with green shrubs the appearance was fine. Everything looked comfortable - Tents - Hats & other conveniences. I saw some of the Surrey Yeomanry chaps who came over on the "Southland" when I returned to the front after being wounded. After a chat we walked a few miles to the aerodrome & saw the celebrated Samsons air ship - a converted Seaplane. Had talks with mechanics & enquired for Capt Japp & found he was over at No 3 Wing on the other side of harbour. Retd to Camp & had dinner of Salmon & cabbage. It tasted like lobster when mashed together & I can recommend it. 
 Wednesday 24th Sergt Smith left early this morning as the sea had moderated.
