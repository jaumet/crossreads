Rilen & I went out to Mr Jervis home this afternoon & we spent a really enjoyable time, in fact we were all talking so interestedly that it was with a start we noticed it was 6.35 & we had a long way to go so there was a rapid farewell & we beat it accompanied by Mr Jervis as far as Portland Rd. here we caught a tram hopped off at 3 Ways & then caught a bus going Harborne way, we just got home in time, slipped upstairs had a wash & then down for some tea in the marquee.
Rilen has been teaching me to play billiards today I want to learn
