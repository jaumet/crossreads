Tuesday 9 April
Wet to-day. This afternoon to Bertangles, north of Amiens about nine kilometres.
We are camped under canvas on a decent hill overlooking the biggest airdrome I have yet seen. Heavy bombardment on the front from early morning is going now extended back as far as west of Amiens.
Wednesday 10 April
Ye Gods, Fritz has attacked in the north about Fleurbaix, etc. captured Saily sur la Lys, Laventie Estaires. The bombardment, very heavy continued until early this morning on this front was very intense. Wet off on to-day a walk to Villers Bocace. Fritz is marvellous!!! The above is so far only a rumour confirmed by Corps H.Q., I cannot say on what front he has attacked. Our camp here is very decent, but there is no water. Whilst we were in bed to-night we were warned with tragic suddenness to be ready to move in the morning to entrain for the north.
