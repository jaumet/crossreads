<p>August 1915<br/>Saturday 28<br/>Cool    Some of our lads have just returned after being wounded. A good deal of firing is going on over at the left. They have not settled down after the attack, evidently expecting another one. Our lads won an important position although losing heavily.</p>
<p>Sunday 29<br/>Fine. Am now assisting the Company Q. M.S. as well as looking after Mr Taylor. I am not to go into the firing line by the Majors orders. We have had a number of luzuries given us by the Regimental fund as well as cigarettes and tobacco from the Victoria Racing Club</p>
