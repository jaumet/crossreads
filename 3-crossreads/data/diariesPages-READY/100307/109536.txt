Paris
4/3/17
Luxurious hot bath at 8 and coffee and rolls while dressing. Left at 9 and walked down Rue St Honore to Place de la Concorde. Being Sunday most of the shops in the streets are closed. In the centre of the Place (where Madame Guillotine was located) there fine fountains the jets rising from mermen inwards to the second water tier. It is a fine big open space surrounded with statues representing the various parts of France. That of Strasburg is wreathed with immortelles wreaths. In the centre is the Luxor obelisk just similar to Cleopatra's needle. 
The Seine runs past this square and seems a fine clear river, there are many bridges. Across the bridge is the Chamber of Deputies above which the tricolor was flying ? an ordinary building. After a look around here walked up to the Church of La Madeline which does not resemble a church in exterior. It is in the form of a Greek temple with many Corinthian pillars. Going inside found it rather like a bank (Colonial) A service was in progress. A very elaborate flunkey dressed in a cocked hat and gold laced coat and carrying a mace kept going round preceding a piggily fat priest who passed round
