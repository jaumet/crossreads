The Towns looks very pretty from the Bay with its \"Chateaus\" &amp; red tiled houses &amp; tall church spires. There are a large number of vessels in port flying the flags of many nations.

Beautiful green fields &amp; trees flower gardens looking their sweetest &amp; the birds seemed to be having a day out, judging by the whistling. It is a splendid country, and all the boys appreciated it after their sojurn in the dry desert, We had rations issued to us at a station called \"Avigden\".

One can see on all sides how seriously the French nation is takeing this great war At all <br/> the stations there are numbers of women employed as engine cleaners &amp; doing other railway work, thus enabling the menfolk to join the colours. There were a batch of about 300 German prisoners of war here just brought in from the front. They looked a pretty healthy lot.
