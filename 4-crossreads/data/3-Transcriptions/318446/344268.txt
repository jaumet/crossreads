<p>Easter Sunday<br/>Khan Yunis<br/>The enemy 'planes are very active now, one came &amp; saw us off when we left Sheikh Zowaiid &amp; again saw us into camp here, so they know all about us.<br/>The railway goes on from here &ndash; I understand for about 5-6 miles &amp; ends about 400 yds. from our first line trenches!  The turks are a few miles further on from there.<br/>As far as I can make out, we seem to be up against the stone wall of the enemy by guns which &ndash; they say &ndash; outrange anything we have produced up to now.  However I believe we attack again on Tuesday.  There is a rumour current just now that we &amp; the 4th Bgde. are going to Shellal which the turks have reoccupied, to hold them from attacking our flank or communications.  However time will show.  I think we are in for a damned hot time wherever we go, so qu'importe?</p>
