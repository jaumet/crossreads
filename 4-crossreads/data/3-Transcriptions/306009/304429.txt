<p>1915<br/>Sep. 2 Thu.<br/>To-night I visited the French Scouts &ndash; they are awfully military although wearing our uniform with red muffler. A few of them speak good English but I found my French very useful. A couple of the Scouts are nice kids. Had a look at an interesting collection of French Military weapons.</p>
