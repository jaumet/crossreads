<p>I had a good wash down on arrival at the Rest Camp &ndash; my first decent one for ten days during which time I never once took off my clothes. Some life this &ndash; a little different from that down at No 2 A.G.H. I ran across several old No 2 chaps during the stand and we grinned reminiscently at one another from under our steel helmets. Haven't had a sleep for 27 hours so will ring off.</p>
