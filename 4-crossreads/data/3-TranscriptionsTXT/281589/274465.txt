us to afternoon tea. Thursday July 19th wet. The bridge in the town is called Anzac Bridge because every afternoon it is never known to be without Australian soldiers sitting on it. Friday fine, went down town. Saturday July 21st Crayford Carnivol procession passed through Dartford, it was a very good turn-out, some very good characters. Mate & I went to Bexley Heath 3 miles nearer London (Crayford is 1 mile nearer London) Bexley Heath is a very select place quite a contrast to Dartford, we spent a good afternoon there. Sunday fine. H.Little (Fred's brother) and his young lady came to see me today & I was very pleased to see them. Monday 23rd July fine went down Dartford as usual. Tuesday fine also Wednesday Thursday & Friday 27th July went to Dford Saturday mate & I went to Woolwich, it is a fair sized town & very nice. We had a good time there. We left Hospital 1.30 PM & returned at 9.30 PM. Sunday fine wet
