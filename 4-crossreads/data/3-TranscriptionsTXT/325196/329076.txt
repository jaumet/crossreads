This morning there was Church Parade, I evacuated the camp while stables were being done this afternoon, met Arthur at the A.V.C. & decided to call at Abbassiah & see Morgan on our way to Cairo, & we were just in time to see him as he was in the Ambulance ready to go to Hospital sick, so Arthur & I went with him to the hospital & then went on into Cairo & had a very good time, Had an Egyptian supper composed of minced meat & rice mixed & cooked over hot coals; unleavened bread, tomatoes onions, & several other dishes which I cannot put a name to; Arthur had been there scores of times before & knew the Egyptian customs & style of eating, everything is very clean & every convenience for washing before dining, no knives
