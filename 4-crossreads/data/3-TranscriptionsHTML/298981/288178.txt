<p>The Royal Engineers</p>
<p>a distance <strike> of about 80 yards</strike> considerably over a mile, and at one point it was tunnelled through a hill for about fifty yards.</p>
<p>Another engineering feat which also occurred in Lone Pine was the tunnelling forward of several tunnels to a distance of 80 yards in front.  These tunnels were then linked together at the head forming a complete tunnel which was parallel to the firing line and at the Lone pine charge this tunnel was opened up at places which allowed our men to jump through and thus gain a considerable amount of ground unseen, as well as causing surprise to the enemy.</p>
<p>From this parallel tunnel more forward tunnels were dug which formed listening posts, and during the construction of this most dangerous work our parties frequently clashed with the enemies underground working parties, and so encounters of various kinds occurred.  During the Lone Pine charge the engineers, as is usually their custom, performed most valuable work, such as making well protected communication between the old and new trenches by digging connecting saps under cover of darkness.  When the enemy position had been taken and made secure the engineers strengthened and widened the trenches</p>
