<p>Left the station about 8 p.m. with our luggage in a Taxi. I'll tell you we were jolly lucky to get one. Arrived at Queen Mary's Hostel, 40 Bedford Place, London W.C. &ndash; It is a Hostel for Nursing-sisters   &amp;  V.A.D.'s &ndash; We were invited   &amp;  am really charmed. shall write   &amp;  tell you more about it later on.</p>
<p>Had a very comfortable journey  down here yesterday. It took nearly all day. Left Lond. at 10 a.m.   &amp;  reached here 5 p.m. Mrs Copp is a charming woman   &amp;  has made me very welcome. Sorry I cannot stay longer. Mr. Copp is very kind   &amp;  good &ndash; a little like Mr H. Copp. They have a very comfortable home   &amp;  are very happy. Poor Mrs. Copp only returned from a Private Hosp. on Friday. Had small operation on her neck/ she is feeling stronger to-day.</p>
<p>Mr. Copp is Mayor of the Town so has a lot of call oon his time   &amp;  his wife helps him a lot.</p>
