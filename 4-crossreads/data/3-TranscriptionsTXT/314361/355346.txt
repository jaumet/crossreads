This time I went through the largest. It is all dark, slippery stone passages, & chambers. Had our fortunes told in the Queen's chamber the usual Tommy rot. We had a good look round & took a few more photos.I have not had word from home for a month now, so expect a good few letters when I reach my battalion.Do not know how I got on with the exam, did well with the practical part, but not too good with the theory.They stopped the Wednesday afternoon holiday.Am writing in YMCA here. YMCAs in Egypt are made of rush matting, which is cooler than canvas.Ferry Post, June 2nd 16Back again with the Battalion. Secured a 1st class certificate from the school.We are leaving for France I think it is next week some time. We have been fitted out with new gear & clothing. Just now we are on a brigade inspection. Will be very pleased to
