<p>Thursday Dec 6th<br/>We have had a week of very sharp frosty weather but during the day it has been clear &amp; bright The ground is frozen on the surface &amp; the ice &amp; frost in the shaded places does not melt all day. It is fine bracing weather with a keen sting in the air I go for long brisk walks and return with a warm glow up<br/>The church services on Sunday last were held under these conditions It was very cold underfoot &amp; the service was a difficult one on account of the cold</p>
