We get some terrific winds here during the day & clouds upon clouds of dust, sand & grit.  I am in comfortable quarters here & the tucker is good. I am keeping a look out for Walter but it is only chance that I will run against him. There is very little news that we are able to write. Am generally glad to get to bed early as we are up about 6. Must close now with love to all at home. Your loving son Leo Thanks for spare paper & envelope will use them next time.  Have plenty to go on with.
