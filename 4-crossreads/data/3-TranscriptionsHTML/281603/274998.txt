On reporting I was told I was being sent to an Instructional School for a month &amp; of course did not mind in the least for it was a pleasure to get away from the mud &amp; slush for a while.

Next morning the 29th we left the transport &amp; made for Albert &amp; after walking about a mile we caught a motor which took us to Albert where we stayed for a couple of days.  During our stay here we received our packs &amp; had a good bath &amp; a change of   <strike>col</strike> clothes &amp; felt quite new after being in the mud for so long.  Our next move was on Sunday the 31st of December &amp; by</p>
