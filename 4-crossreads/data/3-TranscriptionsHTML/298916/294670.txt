<p>very little sleep on the way from Albany on account of the restive horses &amp; the heat. However I amused myself as best I could to pass the time away. From 2 am till daylight seemed a week sometimes. Suddenly there was a hubbub &amp; shouts of "hey panea (parnee) wallah" (water boy) from Chippy who had been asleep &amp; had just awakened &amp; found that the panea wallah had also gone to sleep &amp; the pump had almost stopped. As no answer came Chippy dropped a great lump of wood on the roof where the water boys were asleep. The result was good for several of them came tearing out, one hitting his head on the doorway on the way out. Being disturbed so suddenly, they naturally gave vent to their feelings by using Cingalee language that I did not understand but Chippy evidently did for he replied in very strong words. By daylight the tanks were filled &amp; the A13 took up her position with the first &amp; second divisions. At 11 am these two divisions headed for Aden in charge of the cruiser Hampshire (British) or as he called himself "Hants". The third division &amp; the N.Z. transports remained to take water as they were fast boats &amp; could pick up.</p>
