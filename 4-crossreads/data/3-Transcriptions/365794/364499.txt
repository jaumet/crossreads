<p>Sunday 7th April 1917 [1918]<br/>Wrote Dr. Falkner re Marg. being unhappy, he will perhaps improve matters.<br/>The C.O. comes in &amp; questions me &amp; see abd. rash but only result is that at 4 p.m. the M.O. arrives &amp; in spite of protests from F.E.H. gives an inj. of cholera remarking that it is a good thing to have all these things over while I am lying here in bed.  At the end of my "21 days C.B." I promise to look like a returned soldier with scars.<br/>Letters 2 from "Mick", J.F.H., Ida, 1 N. Bell, Mrs. Rutledge, Nell Barbour.<br/>All well Q'land.  A.T.B. gone to his long rest, poor old man &amp; never again will I quiver at his stern voice or feel his kindly hand clasp.</p>
