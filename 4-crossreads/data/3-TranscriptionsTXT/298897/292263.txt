Ferry post & how soon we move off we don't know, the sooner the better as there are much better camps than this one
Saturday 8th AprilLast 3 days the same.  Digging pits & sandbagging them to prevent sides caving in.   Owing to striking shale & lime stone the work was fairly difficult but I find no difficulty in keeping going all the time.  Reveille is now at 5.30 A.M.  Start on pits at 6 AM. till 7.  Breakfast 7.30 parade 9 A.M. when we once more start on pits till 12.  Afternoon mostly free with a bathing parade in the Canal.  It is an ideal spot for swimming about 120 yards wide & the water very clean. Large ships pass regularly day & night & look very majestic passing slowly down the narrow channel.  Tis a wonderfully busy scene, in addition to the pontoon bridge which is used whenever ships are not passing, two punts are used for the cross traffic & are packed from morn till night. Motors of all descriptions, waggons, horses, camels, are passing to & fro & the light railway makes several trips out to the trenches.
