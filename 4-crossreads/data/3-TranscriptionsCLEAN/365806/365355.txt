3to make ourselves fairly comfortable and should be more so as time goes on.  Probably however we will move to another camp in the early spring.
I am having all my letters still addressed to Bank of N.S.W. as it seems safer.  They forward them to me according to my changes of address of which I inform them.
I did not see or hear anything of Keith before coming away.  He is probably still in England as I don't know what great use could be found for m.m.g's in this weather out here.  I was lucky in getting a run of about 80 miles down South on Tuesday and saw some more of France but only heard the Somme "booming".  Have not been in any front line trenches yet and will now probably wait for another frost as the mud at present is very deep and "muddy".
Will stop now but hope to hear from you soon and also to have other news to write in the course of the next month or so.
Kindest regards to Mrs. Ferguson & yourself.
Yours very sincerely
Lft. Whitfell
