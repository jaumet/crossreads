I have written to Major Colvin tonight at Horseferry Road (Wally will know who I am referring to) & hope to hear from him in the course of 3 or 4 days.  He may be able to fix me up with a billet of some sort or other.While I think of it Daddy dear, thank you so much for sending that 5 I cabled for about a fortnight ago through the Agent General for N.S.W.  It only took 4 days to get the reply & I got the 5 less cable expenses (out & back) of 16/11.  If at any time in the future I have to cable again I will do it through the same means, as it is far quicker & cheaper than through the Commonwealth Bank.I saw Colonel Sturdee by appointment on Monday morning, & he was quite pleased to see me.  He was unable to assist me, however, as he had had previous experience that interfering in this way only made it harder for the private.  He & Major Dods, M.C. DSO.  are both leaving for Australia in about a fortnight's timeBy the time this reaches you it will be your birthday once again or very near it.  I would like, Daddy dear, to wish you very many happy returns of 3rd March.  I do hope & pray, Father, that you are spared to spend many more birthdays with us, & that before the 1918 one comes round that
