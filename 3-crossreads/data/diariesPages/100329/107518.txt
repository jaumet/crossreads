Am not feeling my real self. A lackadaisical feeling percolates me from head to foot, my head is very hot & has a dull pain. Towards evening I felt better but had a restless night. I have received no mail except first 3 letters from Mum Dad & Mabel (1 each). It is very disheartening despite all the more so when I have been so attentive to my mail to home.

I have a very great repulsion to going sick as I have great hopes with regard to my present position.

Rose at 6.30 & felt a little better but as the day progressed, my temperature gained & I had dull aches & pains all over. I have not mentioned my condition yet & will struggle against it to the utmost.
