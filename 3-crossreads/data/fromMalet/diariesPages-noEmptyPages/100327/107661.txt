watching other bursts. Continued down road to beach passing the mule drivers (Indian) in their neat uniform driving in pairs their mule teams of four. On each mule a wooden frame holding on either side 3 petrol tins of water for Wire Gully tanks. Lower down the 26th Battn watching the shells all round and paying no heed to safety only venting a "gorblime" if one bursts too close
Passed Egyptian Maltese Labor colonies to beach which was very busy ? the water smooth the ships looking well lying out of artillery range, tugs lighters being unloaded. A good deal of seaweed being thrown up and stacks being moved further back beyond high water mark. Bread and fresh meat being unloaded and sentries with fixed bayonets patrolling it. Saw Gurkhas standing near stack of empty rum jars and one pulled a cork out of jar at the bottom upsetting the balance of the stack which crashed over frightening hell out of "Johnny" as our men call Gurkhas.
Passed venerable old man with flowing grey beard evidently head serang of the labourers. Continued along to north beach which was so altered as to be almost unrecognisable a breakwater has been made by filling a ship with sandbags and driving her full speed ashore where wanted. Old paddle steamer hard at work on a tow line New huts of wood built right into the cliff side have been constructed for the beach fatigue party. Men hard at work constructing dugout for officers c. Passed enormous ordnance stacks of greatcoats saddlery equipment and rifles c which have been collected from around and placed in neat piles for overhaul and reissue. A small cemetery with very few crosses the prevailing tombstone being a square piece of wood neatly painted
