<p>back in time for dinner. A friend of the family gives us plenty of music &amp;  the evening passes very pleasantly  There is one thing that will never be replaced in my feelings  &amp; that is music.

The first time I have been    <strike>with</strike>in an English home since leaving Australia. My fight with this cold has absolutely got me knocked right out, there are no two ways of putting it &amp; by jove only for my holding out against it, would be down now. Having got rid of the cold (or nearly so) but feel pretty week &amp;  good hot lemon &amp;</p>
