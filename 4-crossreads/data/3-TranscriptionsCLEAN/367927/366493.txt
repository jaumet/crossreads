 The Editor, S.M. Herald 
 Dear Sir 
 Your issue of 1st July (1972) contains a "Letter to the Editor" re Rosebery Park A.I.F. Tablet, and any information concerning its military life around the 1914 period. 
 If this has anything to do with your writer's request I would like to say that a train left Tenterfield about Aug. 19 th 1914 to carry volunteers from the towns between there and Muswellbrook and filled up the train load to Sydney with horses from the Edinglassie horse breeding property 3 miles out of Muswellbrook. 
 I was one of the volunteers of this town, and went on it to Central Sydney where the horses were unloaded and led out to Rosebery Racecourse and kept there until they were sent to Egypt. 
 I remember this well as I had my 20 th birthday during the few days I was there. We were given a final medical test a few days after arrival but I was classed medically unfit as I had had amputation of two fingers of my right hand 12 months previously. 
 If your Mr P.V. Vernon of the tablet committee thinks I can help him further I will be only too pleased to give him what facts I know of.
