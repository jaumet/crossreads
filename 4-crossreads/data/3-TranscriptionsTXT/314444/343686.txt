Dearest Mother Father & Dolly,Recieved your letters, also sent you a cable addressed to Ross Smith. Everything is going on well & I am feeling better than I have for years. Am as fresh & strong as a lion. We are likely to move off any day but have no idea where to. Get plenty of letters from Aunt Florrie & parcels occasionally. I write to her very often too. Give my kind regards to all friends & tell them I am tip top. Have not seen anything of Normy yet. Have seen Oscar w Walford & Young McCauley. They are all well.There is not any news.Hoping you are all wellWith all my love & kissesYour loving Son
