Absolutely a nightmare of a carry with everyone slipping cursing the patient groaning with pain. Without exageration the mud is over my leggings. This afternoon is fine enemy aeroplanes are very active. Another carry at 7 pm. to night.
Nov 3. Move back to Longueval for a rest find the only accommodation taken we are left in the mud. From the ridge behind Flers a good view of Baupume the road to Peronne is to be had. Also the villages of Les Boeufs, Gaudecourt another. Our position was just behind Gaudecourt. Weather showery. Examined a tank this morning.
Nov 4th. At Longueval on fatigue work at A.D.S.
Nov 5th. At Longueval. This morning 1st 3rd Batts attacked the German positions The latter were successful but the 1st had to retire with heavy loss. Details are lacking. Arthur Fleming was killed collecting on the road, about 50 yards away a shell burst in a lorry unfortunately North was amongst the killed, Briggs, Tweddel (?) Wetzel were wounded, the second very badly.
Nov. 6th Still raining. This afternoon we among others were sent up the line on fatigue carrying timber iron. The work had to be done at night with the result when the material was deposited at its destination we were mud from head to foot. The whole thing was a great example of gros incompetence which is rife among N.C.Os officers generally.
Nov 7th Still raining more mud slush While on duty last night I saw a most wonderful allumination of the whole western sky accompanied by great clouds of smoke low explosions. At the same time search lights were searching the sky. Aeroplanes were heard bombs were dropped at many places. It is said that a big ammunition etc. dump was bombed by Zeppelins.
Nov 8th. Still raining but fine this afternoon.
Nov 9th At the line again to the left of our late position. A few hundred yards past Flers within easy distance.
