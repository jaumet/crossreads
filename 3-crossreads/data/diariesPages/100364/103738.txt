We had to occasionally get out and push until we entered on the wire road which we found in magnificent condition. These roads have been the salvation of transport through the desert. The idea is extremely simple, being simply a carpet of large mesh steel wire netting, well pegged down along the margin. It is remarkable the excellent road this arrangement produces, and in spite of the heavy wear of twelve months is in good condition. We arrived at the Camel Brigade Hdqrtrs (General Smith) in time for lunch. During the afternoon interviewed Battalion commanders and arranged the following programme for tomorrow.
