<p>&quot;With great dash and determination you led your company over ground swept by intense artillery and Machine Gun fire, and mopped up two enemy trenches.&nbsp; Later another Company was added to your command and you succeeded in establishing yourself on the final objective.&nbsp; Throughout you displayed very high qualities of leadership and by your marked courage and devotion to duty set a splendid example to your men.&quot;</p>
