Fine again to-day: has been raining for almost a fortnight on off; a treat to see sunshine.
Saturday 2.9.16
Walked to Bailleul, about 6 miles from here bought a few more articles to send home. Feel the effects of the walk, for I have had no occasion to do any walking for the past month. Bailleul a fine old town of no small dimensions. Church a beautiful building, but very ancient; spent some time inside the building.
