<p><u>4</u><br/>exercise. (I walk &ndash; or rather hobble about a little) should set it right.<br/>The Australian troops, on top of their winter in the trenches on the Somme, seem to have been having a very fair share of the late fighting. One wonders when they will have anything like a rest. By the way I heard recently that Keith's Division went up to take part in the Messines show. If they remain in that part of the front I may see something of them when I get back to work. And I hope my next letter will be written to you from the "battle area" as they call it.<br/>Affectionate regards to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy &amp; yourself.<br/>Yours<br/><u>Whitfeld</u></p>
