2/9/18 Haut-Allaines
seeing signs of forming up for counterattack near above place. General Wisdom rang up about 1 pm and said that the Tommies on the left had received rather a smack and he wanted me to push a company up through Haut Allanes in 4 b to cover their flank. Issued the necessary orders for this. Communications as usual are the trouble again. Shifted H.Q. on to Oder Tr having a few salvoes splashed at us on the way and got into a deep German dugout. The number of these dugouts and the thorough work they have put into them is remarkable. Only 700 ft in front of us lies Mt St Quentin which our troops stormed yesterday while we watched through field glasses. On the left is Feuillacourt ? a mass of green weed covered ruins ? relics of the year 16.
