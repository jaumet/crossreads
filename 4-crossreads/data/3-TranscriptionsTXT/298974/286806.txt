 My dearest Mother 
 Theres a little song which is a great favourite with the boys here, it goes My home in Tennersee, Just try &amp; picture me, Right on my mother's knee, She thinks the world of me. All I can think of to night,  Are  Is the fields of snowy white, Banjos ringing, darkies singing, All the world seems bright. Red roses round the door, Make me love mother more, I'll see my sweetheart Flo, And friends I used to know, They'll be right there to greet me, Just imagine how they'll greet me, When I get back, when I get back, To my home in Tennersee! 
 Well, the first time I heard that song
