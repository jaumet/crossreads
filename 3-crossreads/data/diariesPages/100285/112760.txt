we were roughly run through a good few of us including myself were marked for furlough, after this we went round to our various wards then we had a real good tea to which we did full justice for we were very hungry as of course I for one always am now here I am in the writing room scribbling away with a scratchy old pen, my first impression of this place is not very favourable, I suppose after coming out of the lovely home at Harborne Hall makes it seem crook, this place is all big huts, built on the same system as in France.
21st Have just had breakfast which consisted of porridge with plenty of milk fish potatoes
