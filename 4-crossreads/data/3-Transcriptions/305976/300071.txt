<p>The Trek will be in easy stages to spare the Horses. This I expect will be our last long Trek.<br/>Thursday Oct 31<br/>We are all pleased that the campaign is finished. Our days of travelling seem to be numbered &amp; it is said we will soon be going home.<br/>Good news continues to come from France. The Germans are on the run &amp; the betting is 6 to 4 that it will finish next month. What a grand Christmas it will be if the world is at peace again. Received mail to day. All well.</p>
