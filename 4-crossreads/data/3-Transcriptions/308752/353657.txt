<p>the main streets of London, &amp; came across numerous friends, some of whom I had not seen for years, in fact I did not know that they had enlisted. The Guards Procession was held in the afternoon, &amp; near Hyde Park Corner, a place as reserved for the Australian Troops, so I went along there &amp; joined in the fun. The crowds at this particular spot were immense, &amp; the "Aussies" got covered with confetti. I have never seen such crowds of people before, in London &amp; suburbs, are more people than there are in the whole of Australia. Who should I meet amongst the crowd but Mr &amp; Mrs Fothringham, from Mosman, they certainly were surprised to see me.  In the evening I attended a Dance at the Irish Club in Trafalgar Square, and met some very nice people there. Eric &amp; I visited Wembly, &amp; called on Mrs. Cruickshank, had dinner there, &amp; in the afternoon, we attended the Sunday concert at the Albert Hall. We were amazed at the size of the hall, I believe it will seat ten thousand people. The programme was a good one, all Classical music, the Orchestra consisted of 50 violins, so you can imagine how beautiful the music must have been. We attended a Smoke Concert at Australia House in the evening. The programme was an excellent one, only Australians were admitted, &amp; naturally I met a number of old Pals, including a number from Hooper &amp; Harrison Sydney.  There were also a number of Australian ladies present. At 11.45 p.m. the train for Blackpool was boarded at Euston Station. The journey was a slow one, as we did not arrive at our destination till 10.30 a.m. the following day.  I was surely disappointed with Blackpool on this occasion, the place was very quiet, nearly all the places of amusement were closed &amp; the weather was exceptionally cold. I spent a miserable day there, &amp; decided to return to London the following day. Visited the Tower in the evening, &amp; came across a number of friends whom I met there last August.   Arrived at the Alwich Hut, London, at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, and afterwards I enjoyed my-self at an American Dance, at Bishops Gate Institute. As I went along with a party from the Eagle Hut, the admission was only 1/6. It was a fine dance, &amp; the Jazz Band was splendid. At Australia</p>
