 We were called out one morning at about 1.30 in the pitch darkness and when it was raining and scrambled over rough paddocks and through a couple of ruined villages until we reached the ground on which we were to have a mock "Stunt".  It was about 4 a.m. when we were arranged in 8 long rows, one in front of the other and the signal went for us to advance. The light horse went on in front acting as an artillery barrage, and at the front line on which we had to attack away in the distance were flarelights going up the same as though it were a real "stunt". I was in the signalling section, and we kept up communication with headquarters, notwithstanding the wires were cut several times by the Officer to test us. When the "stunt" was over we had some miles of wires to reel up again. We came back to our camp at Faverail in time for breakfast and had the remainder of the day off, when we visited the aerodrome and some German soldiers' graves nearby. Among the German graves was one of an Australian airman with whom they seemed to treat with respect, as his (the airman's) grave was in appearance prettier than lots of the German's graves. 
 Another item of interest here was a large naval battery of artillery which used to fire at a range of 25 miles, and when the guns would discharge a shell they would recoil as much as 6 feet. Sometimes the Germans would retaliate   and drop a few shells in our camp, but while we were there, there were only a couple of horses wounded. 
 We marched from this camp in the night so as the German balloon observers would not be aware that troops were moving in great numbers to the front line, and we reached Norieul where we stayed in a trench which was formed by a sunken road; and in this trench we stayed 8 days until we had the "hop over". 
 During the time we were in Norieul Trench we had a few casualties and we lost among them one of our best platoon sergeants. One day a German Airman flew over our trenches at a very low altitude when he was brought down by "A" Company Machine Gunners. The observer who was shot through the abdomen was carried away on a stretcher to our dressing station where he died, and the pilot who was rather an oldish man but clean shaven was unhurt.
