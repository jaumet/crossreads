The Water arrangements have been bad, Washing Water only on at certain times, and now the Weather is cold, no arrangements have been made for a hot Bath, either of Salt of Fresh Water, there being no plunge Bath's, and the Wash houses too drafty to bath in, the Troop's will have to wait until they go ashore, and we all could do with a Bath before Arrival, and arrangements should have been made for these conveniences before we left London, a blunder was made somewhere, to their discredit.
