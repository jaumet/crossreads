Friday 13 September
Last night the A.D.S. retired to Tincourt because of shelling. Fine day night the Boshe bomb-birds were very busy but not without opposition. It is great to see the plane caught in a dozen lights from all round, shining like a great moth with archies bursting all round tracer bullets going up from our M.G.s. One brought down in flames another under apparent control both throwing out plenty of flares.
Score 1 for archies!!
