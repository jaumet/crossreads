rending crash of H.E. and the infernal clatter of scores of machine guns. Soon the smoke ?barrage" became so thick that is was impossible to see a yard on either side, the only thing for it was to stumble forward follow the, rapidly leaping barrage. Dawn found myself several other officers in the tangle of Grand Priel Woods. Here we gathered in some 50 Germans who wet horrified by the intensity of our barrage were quite willing to surrender in their machine guns mortars without firing a shot. After a struggle among the wired stumps of the wood we emerged on the flat stretch before
Villeret, the trench in front of which was our objective.
