 France 21.4.16 My dearest Sister Just a note this time to thank you for a parcel I received today it was No 11 contained a fine pair of socks &amp; darning wool, they couldn't have come along at a better time, we are in a wet portion of the line &amp; I changed socks these last two nights, one has wet feet continually. The time now dear is 10 past 3 in the morning &amp; things are very quiet I am on duty in the trench &amp; have a little time to finish this note. It is very close to Anzac day now, I believe they are having some sort of celebration in London on the 25th &amp; some of our troops will be there I dont think any of our Battalion will be there, although we should be represented. Well my dearest sister I will close now with fondest love to self R &amp; B. from your loving brother Ken
