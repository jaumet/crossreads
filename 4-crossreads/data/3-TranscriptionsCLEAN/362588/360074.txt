  
 islands periodically ever since.  We shall, all being well, reach Suez at daylight on Friday morning.  We don't know anything about Arthur or any of the others nor have we any idea at present where we are going. 
 We have lost 2 men, one went out with the heat about a week ago and the other died last night.  The latter man was a bad case of appendicitis & although he got through the operation & was doing very well, the heat was too much for him.  Both were buried at sea.  The burial service is a very impressive one but it seems strange that one death should throw such a cloud over the ship as it does. 
 All the men are very contented.  Their food is still excellent and they work well in spite of the heat.  They mostly sleep on deck and it is a weird sight to see them in very scanty clothing sprawled about all over the place in the most extraordinary attitudes. 
 At Colombo we got copies of all Reuter's Cable reports up to 30-5-15 since when we have had no news at all.  We are, of course, very anxious to get the casualty lists at Suez. 
 Please remember me kindly to Mrs Ferguson, Dorothy & Keith. 
 Yours ever very sincerely C.R. Lucas
