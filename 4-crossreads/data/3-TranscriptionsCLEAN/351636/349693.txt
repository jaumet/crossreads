Dear Mr. LaytonWe should be glad if you would investigate the case of Mrs. O'Connor Haldon St. Lakemba who is rather badly in debt. Her son is in camp & apparently allowing her only 10/- p week out of his pay - she is owing in rent & has received notice to quit unless paid.
Yours faithfullyB. Booth.
