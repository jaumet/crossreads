 6/5/18 Querrieu Rain fall in warm steadi shower and must be splendid grow weather . All the fruit tree in the garden are cover with blossom Owing to the rain I cancel the parad call for the morn and order them in the billet to carri out indoor train . An inspect later on prove necessari and disclos dirti billet and other irregular . Last night an aeroplan of our had to make a forc land and the two "bird " came to us for food and shelter . One was a dear littl boy not more than 18 , typic English and who had onli been out a few day from his Cadet School . On my round of the billet I struck a veri old coupl who were refuge from Ribemont . Poor old folk they were crouch over a stove , homeless and forelorn and broke into tear when we spoke of the War and of their home . The old woman was tini and scrupul neat and cri when she told of her two dead son . Where is the glori of War when you see it product in a sight like this ? one of thousand ! The villag look veri pretti under grey weepi sky , with green border of tree and fruit blossom and old fashion redtil hous , some with littl turret and dovecot . Found a man lie sick in a billet and arrang to send the doctor down to him .
