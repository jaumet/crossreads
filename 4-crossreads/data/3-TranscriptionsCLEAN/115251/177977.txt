  
 RABAUL, 28th September 1914: 
 To the Board, Kaewieng. 
 By the terms of Capitulation of 17th September, I promised to give no resistance to the British Troops under Col. Holmes.  It was agreed that all British subjects who were held prisoners should be released.  I therefore request that Vice-Consul Jolley be given freedom to go wherever he may wish.
