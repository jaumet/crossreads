  
 muffler, balaclava, cap, 2 abdominal belts & about 8 pairs socks, towele & toilet gear & sheep skin vest & a rolled blanket straped round the outside as well as a mess tin which is also attached to the outside, so you can quite understand we have a fair weight to carry but one does not feel it if it is properly put on.  Of course it won't be any fun doing a big route march with it on but I don't expect we will have any long ones.  I am getting the photos we had taken sent to Aunt Greta's, she will send them on to you so I hope they arrive safely.  Excuse this short note but I have a lot to do tonight & not a great deal of time.  Give my best love & kisses to all. 
 I remain Your loving son Douglas
