30 September 1918 Monday10 000 prisoners surrendered to our Division & we had to help protect them from the Arabs.  These were cut off south of Amman-  A strange phenomenon happened about noon, a distinct earth tremor, I thought at first it must be my head going round with fever- till others spoke about it.  We celebrated our victory with a grand dinner-   Fish killed with gun cotton-  Fowls from village, Blackberries from the Wadi- game is plentiful, gazelle, Hare partridge, curlew, & CANARIES a few snipe & duck in Wadi, but have no gun.
