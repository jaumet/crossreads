there, I like "Birdy", he gave me a friendly nod, not that he knows me, but he's not a bit like a general with the boys. Generals Monash & McLagan were also there. Billy came round afterwards, & shook hands with two ranks, & our old Brig., who was evidently busy & wanted to get away, said "Is there anyone here knows Mr Hughes personally?" There was no reply, so he spoke in Billy's ear & drew him away. I was one of the last to shake with Billy, he called me "sir." After tea we all drew extra arms, bombs & grenades, pick & shovel. Lor' knows how we'll go over the top with all this load, a chap won't have the strength to bayonet a plum pudding, let alone a Fritz. Our platoon officer Mr Smith, explained our position on the map, & how to read a map by the numbers & letters, to the N.C.O's of his platoon. We are hoping the attack will be very successful, & that few of our good lads may fall. Our company moved up to the line tonight, Boo's will go up tomorrow night. I saw him, also Smith & Eldridge before we went up, & wished them luck. We got to the front line safely, & the 50th Bn went out. There is a lot of luck in this game alright, on the road up, Fritz was dropping shells both
