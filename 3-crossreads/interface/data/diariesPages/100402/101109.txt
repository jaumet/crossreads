Wonderfully quiet. Have not heard a shell apart from the Archies.
Friday 26 July
Last night a platoon of this battalion were to take a strong post led by one of our officers. They failed the only casualties were two Australians, both killed, the officer a Corporal. Something fishy about it. Very quiet. Change over to-night for the Battn. in the line.
