<p>Received a nice letter from Annie Thomas to-day   &amp;  it was dated July 23rd but I am delighted to hear from her. Shall write a few lines to her soon. Must stop now   &amp;  get back to duty.</p>
<p>Got a scribbled note from Dorothy t-day   &amp;  she is still at 46. C.C.C. (B.E.H.)</p>
<p>Fondest love   &amp;  kisses to you all. Hope you are all well   &amp;  happy.</p>
<p>From,<br/>Yours lovingly<br/>Edith.</p>
