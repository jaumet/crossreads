Slept well and almost unbrokenly, except for breakfast etc, until about noon.   The General then called in for a talk and says that still identifications are wanted so after lunch I went up and endeavoured to organize a party to catch one.   Offered 100 francs blood money dead or alive.   The day was fine and quiet.   Walked along Pioneer Trench and had a yarn with Kennedy and King.   Back and saw Colonel James &ndash; a shrewd nut.   While there BM. Bridges came and we argued.   Then Harris of the Engineers was round.   I put up a request for better cooperation between the Brigade Staff and the Engineers but the General was unsympathetic and did not agree.   Our 6th flying pig fired a few rounds today under cover of a light artillery barrage.   Matthews and others came up when the rations arrived and I took the former up the line and round the posts with me.   A sniper has been annoying "le vieux Major" very much and wounded Sammy Dyest and nearly got Harricks.   This devil has now killed and wounded a number of our chaps.   Our snipers are still superior and captured Huns tell of losses sustained in their platoons.   It was a pleasant walk round the front line posts.   We called at all the company headquarters on the way.   All our efforts to catch a Hun proved unavailing.    He moves abroad very little.   Returned to Barracks and there found orders for relief tomorrow night.   Also a particulars of a minor operation of artillery &amp; [indecipherable] on our left but this turned out to be a very small affair and not at all worth bothering about.
