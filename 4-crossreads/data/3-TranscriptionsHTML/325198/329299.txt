<p>8 May, 1916<br/>Bir el ahb [Abd]<br/>We joined up with the troops as they moved away towards the East about eight thirty &amp; kept going for several miles &amp; then formed up at a place called Oghratina here we fed up &amp; re filled our water bottles &amp; grabbed what sleep we could while holding our horses.  About 4.30 this morning we started again &amp; this time we thought we would see some stouch but when we got to this God forsaken hole the Turks has floated.  A Squadron saw the last of them.  Here we are waiting for whats next. I suppose it will be return.  Bill Ross is [indecipherable] out, his hat off &amp; the sun powering down on him snoring a treat.  [indecipherable] reported all clear.</p>
