<p>wounded in the leg.</p>
<p>Had a letter from Ireland the other day, it was waiting here at camp when I came out of hospital, came out on 25th July.</p>
<p>It is very dull here at camp also very hot, the thermometer rose to 127&deg; a few weeks ago. I will be glad to get back to the trenches again, it is really exciting there at times, even when we go in swimming we are under shell fire, I used to go in every second day when I was over there, it was always lovely &amp; calm &amp; very refreshing, as there was no fresh water to be had for washing there was scarcely enough to drink.</p>
<p>The Turks are all big fellows the majority of them 6 ft or over. I have shot one Turk that I am certain of up to the present, I may have shot others I dont know of, I hope I did.</p>
<p>It has been a long summer for us here, the weather being warm when I joined in Sydney first</p>
