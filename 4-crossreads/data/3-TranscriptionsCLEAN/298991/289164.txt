 Saturday May 5th Started on the physical drill today, & my word it hurt too, as I haven't done any drill for about 10 months. Re-examined by the Colonel today & classed as B1 A2, that is I am getting better. Today is a real summers day. The Camp is  right up  on top of a big hill overlooking the sea, & about 3 miles out of Weymouth. 
 Sunday May 6th Very cold wind blowing. It was a very cold night last night. It is very poor food here, a fellow feels hungry the whole day, & what we do get isnt cooked right. The food is spoilt by the cooks. Went for a walk to the harbour this afternoon. 
 Monday May 7th A lovely day.  Was  Received second issue of clothing today, issued with a good few articles not needed, apparently the military is not short of clothing. Fell in 2.30 pm & was marched to Westham, a distance of about 2 miles. It is nearly in Weymouth. The huts are much smaller at Westham. Had our kit bags carried. Very tired upon arrival here.
