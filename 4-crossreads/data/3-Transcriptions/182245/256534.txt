<p>JANUARY 1917</p>
<p>19 FRIDAY</p>
<p>Fine with&nbsp; cold wind blowing. We</p>
<p>packed up &amp; left our billets at</p>
<p>Strazeele about 10 AM &amp; came</p>
<p>up to our positions at Armenti&egrave;res</p>
<p>The waggonslines are about four</p>
<p>miles behind the lines. Jesus Farm. We have</p>
<p>good covered stables with flaged</p>
<p>floor so we have no mud. We</p>
<p>have small huts to sleep in, &amp; are</p>
<p>very comfortable though crowed.</p>
<p>I was lucky &amp; got a bunk to sleep</p>
<p>in. I came up driving lead of</p>
<p>a G.S waggon, &amp; was lucky to</p>
<p>get it as I came straight to</p>
<p>the waggon lines, while the</p>
<p>others went up to the pits &amp; did</p>
<p>not get back till all hours</p>
<p>of the night. I was on picket</p>
<p>at night. Well I have got to</p>
<p>[??w] at last after a year &amp;</p>
<p>14 days in the army.</p>
