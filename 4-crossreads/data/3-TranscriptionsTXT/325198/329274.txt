 22 March, 1916 Gabul Mirium I hear Perce hunting Lamb out of his place where he is trying to have forty winks.  Lamb is expressing himself with strength but it is no go he has to make room, Perce wants room to join in a game of cards Cameron &amp; some of us put it to the nigger to bring us some lollies he brought us a small box &amp; charged us 7/- for it.  They were the most expensive Ive ever had the pleasure of tasting   The nig joined in a game of cards &amp; won about 35 p.t. off them  then floated &ndash; he is a shrewed cuss that nig.  He comes out every day with a couple of donks &amp; brings things to sell from Ismalia
