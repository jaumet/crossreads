 1917 JANUARY 
 10 WEDNESDAY 
 Fine, but cold. Grooming horses 
 all the morning &amp; in the afternoon 
 we had to harness up &amp; swap 
 all our black horses harness &amp; 
 everything to the 118 th &nbsp;Battery 
 for their grey horses &amp; dirty old 
 harness. We got a very bad 
 deal, but it was orders &amp; had 
 to be done. Saw an observation 
 balloon brought down in 
 flames. They are having a 
 hell of a &quot;strafe&quot; today &amp; after 
 dark the sky was just lit 
 up with flashes of guns.
