[Friday 5 May 1916]
Busy shopping & going to teeth attended to, these notes please are not interesting-Hear our men are doing well in France- a Mail is in but all my letters will be with the Brigade  Will have time to write you decently & also Mrs Forth.  Nowell has quite "Le Grande manner" & has the slow (plenty of time) manner of those who live in the East for long-   We bridged a few years in yarning from old Carrakoorte days-Saw Cuth Fetherstonhough & his wife both well.
