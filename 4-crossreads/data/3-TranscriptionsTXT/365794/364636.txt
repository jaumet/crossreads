 Thursday 22nd August 1918 Find &pound;1 to my credit in pay book, mistake made in Alex. B.H.Q. in May '18.  About the A.I.F. there are 2600 ill out of 18000 on this front principally caused by diseases of Jordan Valley.  Two of our R.A.F. boys burnt to death while flying lately up the line, one Craig from Q'land the other I know not.  9 sick sisters with Spanish 'flu.  Most of Sisters are new &amp; some have ward of 100 &amp; over.  Mine 23 pts. only &amp; practically convalescent. Went Cairo for camera which has a hole in bellows, cost Pt. 5 to mend. Had hair shampooed for 2nd time, 1st on 20/8/18.  Paid for course &pound;2 or 4. One orderly removed from night duty &ndash; remaining one is fairly good.
