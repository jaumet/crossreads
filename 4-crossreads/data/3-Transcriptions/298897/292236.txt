<p>Friday 24th, Christmas Eve<br/>Busy pulling down tents &amp; packing up.  We received a splendid issue of stuff.  An Xmas billly &amp; pudding between two men, also tinned fruit milk etc, more than we could eat.  Received a visit from some friends &amp; after tea visited their camp.  About 9 oclock we had a supper of cake, beers wine champaygnes &amp; Brandy the latter I donated for which act the company sang "For he's a jolly good fellow etc".  Although the drinks were much mixed we had a real good evening with sing song speeches etc.  We also received an issue of Red X goods, a mixed lot for which we <strike>recei</strike> drew by ballot.  The excitement &amp; pleasure attached to opening our billies was worth seeing.  Shrieks of laughter &amp; cheering could be heard from all sides &amp; the reading of enclosed letters caused great sport.  I "tossed up" with a friend for my letter &amp; lost.  The contents of the billies was varied but useful &amp; ranged from tobacco to pins.  Pencils, paper, lollies, cigarettes, laces, knifes, mouth organs &amp; so on.  The puddings were splendid &amp; proved a treat indeed.</p>
<p>A second issue of food stuff to us consisted of tinned fruit, milk</p>
