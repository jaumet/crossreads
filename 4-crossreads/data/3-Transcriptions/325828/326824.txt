He enters the War in the Medical Service   &amp;   details his service throughout Egypt, France    &amp;   England.  His descriptions of learning to fly are particularly interesting.]</p>
<p>Tichborne. N.S.W.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 18.4.15<br/>11-4-15<br/>My dearest Father,<br/>I was sorry that I was unable to write during the week, but for the next 5 or 6 weeks I must confine my writing to Sundays alone.  We are exceptionally busy seed-sowing &amp;  have no time at all to spare during the week.  He pulls me out now at &frac14; to 5 to feed the horses    &amp;   a nice job I have sometimes looking for them as it is pitch dark then.  As soon as dinner is over we are pickling wheat till its time to go out again.  After tea its the same game, pickling by lantern light till 9 or &frac12; past, when we let the horses out, &amp; are jolly glad to go to bed ourselves.<br/><strike>The</strike> In spite of the recent rain we had a terrible dust-storm here on Friday &amp; as I write now it is impossible to see more than 300 yards owing to a storm now on.<br/>Sam Pearce is to be married in Sydney next Wednesday I'm afraid he is going to make a mull of things as he has only known the girl a short time, &amp; has only been engaged for 6 months.  He has bought an orchard (Knows absolutely nothing about orcharding) 10 miles from Hornsby &amp; 13 from Pennant Hills.  "Glenorie" is name of the village.<br/>For some unaccountable reason a good number</p>
