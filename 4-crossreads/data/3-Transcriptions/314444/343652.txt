<p>You should get more than a letter a week as I have written pretty frequent up to date. I hope you recieved that dress material. So far I have not recieved the socks, The hills are so steep that I think they leave all parcels at head quarters  until we come back to base which is every now &amp; then.<br/>I am glad Darcey beat McGoorly. How is young Bill. Give him my kind regards &amp; tell him I could do a dinner at Adams. I suppose you are all busy trying to find the winner of the Cups.<br/>I have not seen Dan Wells since I arrived I heard young Walford was on his way back to Sydney through a nervous break down. Give my kind regards to all &amp; tell them I am well.<br/>With love to all at home, &amp; hoping you are all well your loving Son<br/>Tom H. Hill</p>
