of whom a few men tumbled. Through the Menin Gate to the corner where a traffic man told us that Hellfire Corner was being strafed. Passing the main dressing station noticed many wounded men. Hellfire Corner was churned to pieces and we wasted no time getting past. Some guns knocked out, dead horses putrefying all round and some chaps flung out of their graves by deep plunging shells. A motor lorry was burning and blown to pieces. At Birr Cross roads we got a good lateral view of the rear of the battle field where long flashes leapt out of the slopes of distant rises. Here we found our dumps of water and panniers ready and also our guides. The men loaded up and swung off the road towards a Corduroy track. A fair amount of stuff was flying round and presently a shell got into the rear of a little group about 70 yards in front of us killing 2 and wounding about 3 others. Legs and arms were flying all over the place but Monaghan the sergeant is a good relentless old chap
