  
 Having been completed, an Australian Sergeant & 8 men left on Sat morning 19.10.18 to establish a depot there, after leaving Three Kings I returned to Eypres where I had to wait for further instructions so in the mean time, we had breakfast after obtaining a bottle of tea from 6th Aux Sub Depot, the boys in this [indecipherable] are camped in wagons in the loco shed which has the roof knocked off & large holes in the walls, & all around like the station yard the lines are broken & twisted in all directions, the engine turn table looks a sorry picture, a shell has exploded under the centre & lifted the table up one end & throwing it on an angle & the rail all around & leading to it are blown up & twisted, in fact one can hardly find a space of level ground, one shell hole leading on to another. 
 After waiting for about 1 hour I was attached to a Canadian engine & a few trucks & away we went back to Poperinghe, stopping at [indecipherable] were we shunted into the yard on to an empty troop
