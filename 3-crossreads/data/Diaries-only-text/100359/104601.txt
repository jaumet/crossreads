being Sunday we got orders from "Molly" to pack up and leave our "Happy little ?ome. where we were so comfortable and clear out to the Baths. It is an awfully dismal place. The roof is full of holes and the rain pours in everywhere. We were quite "cup up" about it and had to resort to "the Dive" before we gained our normal spirits again.
Tuesday 5th
"More fire buckets and still more fire buckets until the enemy is crushed" MacDougall is painting flags. "Frenchy" is fixing up the Engine at the Baths, and Peter Dawson is at the 15 F. Amb. building a Rest Station so the 8th is being kept busy. Jolly good news in the Paper today about the Zep. Being brought down. They are turning our school into a hospital and 4 patients arrived today. 
Wednesday 6th
Glorious day, just like a spring day in Sydney. One bloomin? day is so much like another that its hardly worth writing about.
Thursday 7th
Last night about 11, I was awakened by a terrific bombardment. The big guns fairly shook the building and the rat-tat-tat of the machine guns sounded almost like someone throwing pepples on an iron roof. 
Now and then a lump of plaster fell from the roof, and smashed in pieces on the floor. It was a beautiful moonlight night and I lay there gazing out of a big hole in the roof just over my head, and thought about the poor devils out in the trenches. This is Market day and the streets present quite a lively appearance. Mac and I having nothing much to do, took a stroll around and watched the people buying and selling at the different stalls. There were all kinds of things for sale. Fruit and vegetables, bales of material for making dresses, fowls, pigs, hairpins and almost everything imaginable. One old dame took my eye, she was buying a nightgown and held it up at full length. It was a real old fashioned one with long sleeves and fitted close up to the neck.
