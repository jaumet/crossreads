<p>Dear Senator Pearce</p>
<p>It was very good of you to let me see this correspondence. Thank you for that &amp; for all your kindness.</p>
<p>In view of the interest you have been good enough to take in my boy, I should like you to read the enclosed extracts from two of his letters to his mother &amp; myself. The first was in answer to a letter from me in which I told him that I thought he might possibly be offered some kind of Staff appointment, &amp; left him to do as he thought right.</p>
<p>With kind regards</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely</p>
