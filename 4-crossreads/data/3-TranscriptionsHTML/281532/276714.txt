<p>Had a talk to a Lieutenant of English artillery and saw crowds of Hun prisoners in a cage. Late in the afternoon the weather set in cold windy and bleak. Long strings of cavalry were moving up before dark and the railways surrounding here were busy with many trains. Flares show up a tremendous distance off. Although the firing line averages 8 miles off yet the flares seem only about a mile off. At twilight went up again on to the high ground &ndash; a windy dark cold night &ndash; one for a home fire and peace but here in war, bloody war and a hole in the ground for a dwelling. Charlesworth my batman is a good man. Little [indecipherable] as A/Adj is splendid capable little soldier who will go far in civil life.</p>
