 [The following paragraph crossed through.] If my Bronchitis is no better I shall try & get "boarded" for Australia from England, others are doing it so why should not I. Of course I hardly expect such luck but I  don't  want to go back at present. I may feel different after being away another month. 
 My Papers came today & I'm really off tomorrow, all very secret & no name of boat mentioned. I shall be glad of the chance of seeing something of ITALY. Left Alex Sept. 27 wire Cable on arrival.
