<p>Thursday, 9 September, 1915<br/>I got through my morning sick parade alright, this is practically a farce, they are mostly Diarrhoea patients &amp; the Doctor sits down with his pill box in front of him &amp; gives out pills, the main thing I do is the dressings usually about 15, scratches &amp; cuts &amp; minor wounds but they all get septic, apparently the old corporal was very lazy for I got a lot of extra chaps down just to see what I was like, by obliging one does not do any harm.  I have the whole day off bar the parades so went round to the 6th Amb again to see if my brothers had landed they had but the two boys were sent back with the transport the youngest is not very strong &amp; the captain did not like separating them.</p>
<p>Friday, 10 September, 1915<br/>Two fairly big sick parades the Dr is as I heard frightfully lazy turns up late and has a nasty way of speaking although he does not interfere with me, I do my work and allow  him to do his.  I wrote home to-day but we have not rec any recent mail.  Every day they are taking men off for a spell but very slowly, there was heavy artillery fire all day, the Turks put some big shells over but did very little harm, the navy bombarded all day.  Our trenches here are 800 yds from the Turks and one squadron mans them one night &amp; another the next every night one squadron go out sapping until two a.m then return home &amp; get two hrs sleep but have to stand to arms from 4 am to daybreak in case the Turks attack altogether the men dont get half enough sleep.</p>
