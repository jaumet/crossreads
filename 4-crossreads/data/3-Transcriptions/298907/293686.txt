<p>swarming with people all sitting about on the grass &amp; under the shady trees for it was a glorious sunny day &amp; real hot, the people were all out in their summer dresses &amp; the whole ground was simply a blaze of color with what seemed to be countless thousands of happy little kids running about &amp; enjoying themselves I never seen so many children together before, all Birmingham must have been out taking the air, I know I had a good turn with the little Yankee girl we went down to a bonza little Park, private one with beautiful little lakes fountains rose walk &amp; etc, just the place for a camera &amp; I got quite a number of shots which should prove very interesting.</p>
<p>21st Out again this afternoon with my U.S.A. girl, we got a taxi at New</p>
