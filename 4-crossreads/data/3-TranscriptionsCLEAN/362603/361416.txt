2.  & walk 2 or 3 miles & get back before dark.  I am taking a walk every night that it is fine.  I went to Church at the little old Milstone Church on Easter Sunday.  It is so quaint & I had to sit up in the Chapel near the Altar, as the wee Kirk was full.On Thursday I had to go to Southall Hospital on Escort Duty.  I delivered My Patient & being only a little way from Richmond I went to see Mrs Harbert.  Everyone was out, but the maids admitted me & I sat by the fire, & amused Myself at the Piano till Mrs H. & one of the Girls came Home.
