  
 May 1917 13th.   Sunday.-  The good weather still continues & is well appreciated.   We have done very little work owing no-doubt to the fact that the remainder of the  section  Company have started to move down here. 15th.   One blanket was handed in to day, leaving us with one each. 17th   We have been doing very little since the 13th. except small jobs scattered about the village and at Vaux. The weather has not been very good of late, & we have had plenty of rain. 18th.   The weather has been fairly warm to-day & the aeroplanes very active on both sides.   I have been drawing out plans for a bridge to be built on a canal 5 or 6 miles from here, to carry artillery.
