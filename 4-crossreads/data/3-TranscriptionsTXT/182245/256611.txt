 1917 APRIL 
 6 FRIDAY 
 A beautiful sunny day, except 
 for a little shower during afternoon. 
 Cleaned &amp; polished my saddle 
 in morning &amp; reading in feed 
 room all afternoon. I got a 
 letter (5 th &nbsp;April) from Mother &amp; a 
 letter of mine to Alan returned. 
 Well what a difference to last 
 Good Friday; when I had to go 
 back to the Warren to look 
 after horses for the day.
