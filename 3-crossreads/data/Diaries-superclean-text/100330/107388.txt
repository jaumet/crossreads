all around them, one of the Balloons is right over head I was awoke up from a sleep by one shell bursting over the Top of the Balloon, I jumped up covered my head under the clothes hanging on the Tent Pole for protection from the Bullets, as it was none came through the Tent although they were falling on the Roofs of the Huts close by. A little later on Fritz judged a shell nicely damaged the wings of the balloon overhead it was pulled down another sent up, As I write these lines Fritz is trying to hit another balloon near by is getting very close to it. As there is about 20 Balloons which I can see Fritz has plenty of targets to shoot at, I don't pretend to be a hero, still it is not to comfortable to be sitting in your Tent while the Shrapnel is bursting over head, As a shell bursts you can hear the Nose Cap hissing as it falls in the bush so when a shell bursts you dont know where the Cap or Bullets are going to fall. There are a large number of Aeroplanes patrolling up above at
