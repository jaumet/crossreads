I would like the opportunity of meeting him for the title; Taube paid the camp a visit at 9.30 one night while I was away & dropped bombs in the moonlight but did no damage. Two came over again today & dropped a few bombs & the empty cases & pellets from the Anti-Air-Craft guns were a bigger danger to us than the Taubes, but no one was hit. 
 14-1-17 Sun 14th A couple of Taubes came within sight this morning but kept out of range of the guns & dropped no bombs, I was down
