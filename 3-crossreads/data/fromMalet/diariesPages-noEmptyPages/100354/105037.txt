Thursday 8th June saw us again on the move for the trenches. A soaking steady rain fell as we marched in making the foot-hold on the duck-boards very unclean as usual stirring the unboarded trenches into a gummy slush which adhered to everything it touched. Everything was very quiet. The German lines at this point were from 250 to 450 yards apart grass a yard high mingled with the mangled stumps of trees the wire entanglements in the intervening "No-mans land".
Our artillery on the 9th aggravated Fritz to the extent that he threw over a dozen or so coal-boxes which made an awful noise and scattered a few loose sand-bags but did nothing further. However had he been allowed to persist at the game he may have rendered some of us homeless or at least "dug-out-less" for the night but our light field guns quick firers began to play havoc with his parapets he desisted. As the afternoon cleared off there was considerable aerial activity both our A.A. Guns the German's ? but particularly the latter's ? wasting hundreds of shells covering half the sky with a canopy of shell-smoke.
