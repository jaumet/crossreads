<p>Went out to exercise the horses this morning along the sea shore we walked them close to the waters edge and it was good fun watching the antics of them as each big breaker came ashore Sometimes coming up to the girth. The wind has been blowing something terrible during the night and this morning and waves were very high. There is a small mine sweeper run ashore &ndash; close by where she ran ashore several days ago in a gale. Great waves are breaking over her and she lies helpless on one side<br/>There is some sort of a mad rumour to the effect that Australia has asked for a separate peace sounds too good to be true. Kaiser Bill will be saying Gott strafe Austria! He has "strafed" everyone else up to now.<br/>There is also another rumour much nearer our hearts than that and that is "Get ready to move at 12 hours notice"! We may be going to take Rafa it may be soon and it may not eventuate for a few days but there it is.<br/>C Squadron is on out post duty tonight which will require 9 signallers. I don't envy them if we have a night such as last night the wind rain and cold was something scarcely credible for these latitudes.</p>
