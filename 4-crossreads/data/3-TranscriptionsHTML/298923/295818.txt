<p>1 June 1918 Saturday (X to X crossed out)<br/>X During my inspection of the Guard last night- One man "fell in" (after a great bustle round) &amp; went thro' the motions of "Present arms" <u>without</u> any rifle!!!  It was dark &amp; he thought I would not notice among 9 or 10 others-   This after only 7 mos. not bad for a young soldier!!! when he mislaid his rifle- comprenez! X<br/>Bad news from France taking Soissons! how will it all end.<br/>Rode into <strike>Jerusalem</strike> Bethlehem, but wherever Cavalry Camp, the dust becomes dreadful &amp; ones eyes suffer.</p>
