<p>Wednesday 8 December, 1915</p>
<p>Was pretty tired this morning had a bit of a read &amp; played cards till dinner time.</p>
<p>Played handball in the afternoon, also after tea then we had a game of cards for about an hour. At present I am showing a total cash balance of 7/- out of 10/- I had on Friday so I am not doing too badly.</p>
