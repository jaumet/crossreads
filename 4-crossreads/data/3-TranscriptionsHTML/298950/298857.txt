<p>Against the bacteria &amp; germ laden dust.  The Criminals in jail are allowed to take their Meals in clean cells, their food being cooked in clean kitchens &amp; carried along clean &amp; dust free passages, whereas we hawe to carry our food through rain, sunshine or dust storms into the dust covered ally 2 feet shed space, wher we hawe to eat it, nothwithstanding that the bacteria &amp; germs originating from the sputum of tubercoilose persones, from the urinals wich hawe free access to.  The Criminals in jail live in quite cells &amp; whereas we are herdet together so closely that the continual noise of a multitude confined on a smal space is several trying &amp; nervous.  For above reasones every one wich is perfectly true description of the conditiones excisting hier.  The wishe of a large majority of the Civ Internees of this Camp is to be able to exchange this hygienically &amp; sanatorely unbearable place with the jail, wich is in comparission to our modes of living would be far prefferable in this respect.  But we the undersigned do not intend to committ any breaches of the law for the purposses of getting into better sanitary &amp; hygienic condition by a conviction to a term of imprisonement.  During 3 years of internement all petitiones for improvement have been unsuxcessfull in this respect.  In spite of all promisses, no improvements have been made   Our experiences of past sumers in camp tell us that the horrors of past sumers will be intensified during the coming hot weather &amp; will make our mode of live, wich allready is an insult to humanity, still more unbearable.  We now aske you to transfer us into one of the State jails wher we hope to find at least a refuge for the undescrible horrors of the Vermin &amp; dust plagues.  We beg to inform you that we are handing copies of this comunication to the Consuls of Swizerland &amp; Sweden with the request that they may support this application to you.  The Committee.</p>
