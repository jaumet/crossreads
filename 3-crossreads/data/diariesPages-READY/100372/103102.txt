11th on the way, first decent sized houses we have seen. Also several thro several native villages and about 1am on 12th just outside Ejji a bosker storm, very heavy thunder & vivid lightening caught us. Special G[round] sheets proved very acceptable & we were all fairly dry. Camels turned their rumps to rain must have been ¾ or 1 inch of rain. However we barraked till dawn, had a light breakfast and made Julis about 8.30 on 12th (Julis a native village.) Scrapping going on ahead of us, mtd troops I think.
12th Evidently gained their objectives as Jacko counter attacked. Here we heard Jacko pushed right back and that 60th div. within 4 m. of Jerusalem & troops landing at Jaffa. Also German troops reinforcing etc. Not authentic report only. However part must be fairly true as Hebron offered very little resistance. At 0515
13th on 13th we moved to near Wadi Medina & from here I write, guns and MGun fire within hearing. Jacko having instns to hold out on Wadi. Expecting go on any minute. Genl. Allenby seems the one. Native village here much same as other places, mud huts altho larger, being chief and in most villages only type of house. Soil here cracked for want of rain but looks splendid soil, supposed to be most fertile in world no crops growing. Apricots figs, pears or plums trees growing & oranges too. 13 of our planes bombed Jacko yest[terda]y. Saw a scrap between one of ours and two of his at camp on 5th. Both of his cleared home Large number of guns and loads of ammunition captured, at Huj reported a whole ordinance depot taken.
Official reports not yet obtainable. Washing etc. still out of question am as dirtyclean as possible but very dirty
