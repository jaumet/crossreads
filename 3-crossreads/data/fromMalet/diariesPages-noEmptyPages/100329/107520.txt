Am feeling better, much to my relief.

Arthur Gray called on me with Red Cross Sergt. Had a chat about home & the war. He had received no letters beyond a couple from Clara. Gave him 6 pkts cigs, 2 tins bloater, 2 lemonade powders, 1 pkt tobacco, as he had been short. I was glad of his call; it is indeed refreshing to come into contact with one so closely connected with home. I live a pretty solitary life here – no pals, no one to chat with as they are mostly N.Z’s & complete strangers to me. Beyond a good day salute & the usual formal talk connected with my work with those around me, I have little distraction. It’s a long day – I am awake at 6.30 & go on duty not later than 8 am. 9.30 pm is my average hour of knocking off & there is nothing to do but to creep into one’s dug-out & try to sleep. My active brain does not give me much peaceful sleep however. Each night I am visited with grotesque dreams of vivid variety but little coherence & in the morning I awake with a thick head & no remembrance of the fantasies of the night.

8 pm – Seem to have entirely recovered from yesterday’s sickness. Hope recovery is permanent.

Wednesday 8th Sept. 1915

Decided to walk to Walkers Ridge as I heard mail had arrived. Set out 2 pm & on arrival was rewarded for my trouble in receiving 2 letters from Mab, 1 Mum & 1 from Gran. No letters from Grace, Dad or C.M.

Mab’s letters dated 18th & 26 July Grace’s 19th Mum 23rd July

Mab says in her first letters she has been expecting another letter from me every day. She does not realise I was on the water right up to the 26th July when on
