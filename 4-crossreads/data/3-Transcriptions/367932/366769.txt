<p>"We evacuate this week, be ready!" we could not have advertised it more.</p>
<p>Well &ndash; after all! We got off &ndash; we came to Lemnos on a very crowded boat, &amp; went ashore on the afternoon of the 20th.  There was nothing ready &ndash; they had expected wounded.  We set to &amp; pitched tents.  Next day was no good &ndash; it rained most of this morning, there was no wood, &amp; very little water, we lived on tinned fruit &amp; managed to cook a Dixie of porridge each for tea.</p>
<p>Lemnos is a fine harbour, crammed that day with shipping, but there is no town you cannot get a bath, nor a meal, so you can imagine how we felt, when we got marching orders again.  We each have about 100 lbs of kit up &ndash; so these route marches are no joke.  Its winter now &amp; you want a fair kit &ndash; because &ndash; goodness knows where we are going to.  It might be Saloni-ka, but most probably Egypt &ndash; but no one knows we are at sea again, that's all we are certain of.  If its Alexandria we ought to get in about Monday 27th Percy must be there I hope he is &ndash; not a bad boat this she was behind us, in the first fleet that came over it seems a long time ago!</p>
