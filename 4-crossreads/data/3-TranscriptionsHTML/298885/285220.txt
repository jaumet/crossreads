<p>May 13th &ndash; 18<br/>After waiting anxiously I received word 3 days ago from Wal per telegram which contents knocked me all of a heap.</p>
<p>It bore to me the news that I had lost my dear old brother who died of his wounds at No2 Aust Gen Hospital Boulogne on 5th Inst I cannot realise it that Stan has made the great sacrifice and given his All for Home &amp; Country</p>
<p>It is the best sacrifice from which we can gleam a certain amount of consolation</p>
<p>There is not a better way of leaving this world.</p>
