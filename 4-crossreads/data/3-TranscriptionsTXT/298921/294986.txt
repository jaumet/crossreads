 January, 1915 Wednesday 13 Went ashore &amp; had dinner at the Grand Oriental Hotel then a car to Mrs [indecipherable] &amp; the [indecipherable] Gardens. Finishing up with a box at Grace Palottas show. Washing sent ashore came back beaten to pieces &amp; yellow. The currency here is Rupees &amp; cents. But English gold is always acceptable. Soldiering is an expensive luxury.
