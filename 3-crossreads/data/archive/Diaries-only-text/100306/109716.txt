Firing Line Le Sars M16b67-M16a08 
22/2/17 Hours dragged on and there was still no sign of the relief complete message coming through. Eventually at 3.15 it did arrive and the other people moved off. Whilst the situation summary was in transit a heavy shell landed right on top of the dugout and cut the main Brigade line. Except for scattered shells and some heavy rumbling on the flanks all was quiet. Our patrols under Massie early in the night found nothing of note but once got badly lost. Later one of them ran right on to a Hun post and they blew poor little Wittner to pieces with a bomb and riddled him with machine gun bullets. A fine little chap. The others got back safely. What a filthy business this is. Sat up all the rest of the night but towards dawn got dreadfully sleepy and once carried on a nonsensical conversation while fast asleep! Groves questioned me as to the location of an O.P. out in No Mans Land and I next became conscious of having my eyes shut and replying in a far off voice "That it was essential that men of previous experience in the firing line in France be put on!"
