<p>19 May 1915<br/>Wednesday Battle of Gaba Tepe</p>
<p>40 wks of soldiering<br/>The Turks advanced at 3 PM &amp; were met by an awful fire from our troops every arm possible did deadly work &amp; cut them to pieces &amp; at Courtneys they lay two deep.  We held &amp; beat them badly without reinforcements the New Zealanders charged and utterly routed them, gunboats lend a hand on both sides our howitzers do deadly work  in 1 case 500 Turks were assembled below Quinns &amp; two shots from our guns put the whole crowd out of action, 1 m gun got a whole battalion who were reinforcing.  Every move was foreseen &amp; beaten, aeroplane's ours and enemy's are seen everywhere &amp; saw ours giving theirs a go, Turkish prisoners &amp; wounded arrive, one m gun put out of action, water jacket blown off.  Arty fire at 5 AM was stupendous indescribable the scream of the shells carry  A naval battle has been in progress all day over to our right, battle still raging tonight.</p>
<p>20 May 1915<br/>Thursday Armistice 6 PM to 7.30 PM</p>
<p>Stand to arms  at 3<br/>We expected the Joe Mcquirks again last night for aeroplanes reported last night that they observed 3000 Turks in a wood over to our right front &amp; then a further 3000 coming to strengthen their centre, 14 prisoners taken last night &amp; 1 German officer, snipers get cheeky this morning and one pokes his head over Steels point &amp; goes out, aeroplanes give us further amusement, at 6 an impromptu armistice was declared for the Turks to bury their dead we have none. They came right out of their trenches with a white flag, German officers were there of course having a 'screw of our positions in front of Popes, 2000 Turks threw down their arms but we couldn't provide an escort for it would weaken our trenches, prisoners were taken though &amp; were sent into camp under an escort, at 7.30 they commenced to fire &amp; so did we, &amp; our artillery opened, theirs were afraid to give away their positions, and by 11 they had had enough for we gave em fits</p>
