February 1916
we went for an all day route march passed through the village of Tel-el-Kebir. It is only a small place but some of the most foul air I ever smelt were in that place. There are also some big orchards orange groves for orange are grown in abundance throughout the whole of Egypt. We marched right to the far side of the village into the desert the other side had musketry I put my foot on the first patch of grass since leaving Sydney. On the 25th we had an artillery formation across the desert for several miles it was very interesting work, then again on the 28th we went into the desert for musketry. On the 29th we had to strike camp get ready to move again I was put on baggage guard. before leaving we were issued with 150 rounds of ammunition from that onwards always carried it. We got into the train at 10.30 am. went back towards Suez to a place called Serapeum where we branched off went to a siding near the canal. There is some very heavy sand to get through before reaching the canal but now they are making metal roads. There is a punt also a pontoon bridge across the canal it was across this that we had to go. Our camp was about 1 miles the Arabian side of the canal was a terrible sandy place. We were issued with a pint of water for 24 hours sometimes it had to last 36 hours
