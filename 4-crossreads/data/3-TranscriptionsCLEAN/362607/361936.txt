  
 Dear Mum, Dad & George,  This is a residential part of Cairo. It is very nice as you see. Only well-to-do people live here. All places have flat roofs just as Sydney is starting to build them. I find it a hard job to write letters now as I have nothing to write about at all. It is very war, to-day & the flies are bad. They are so strong that a fellow hurts himself trying to kill them. I will get someone to relieve me & go up to Heliopolis for an hour or so tonight. The Censor is very strict now so I can't tell you nothing about our movements even if I knew any.  Love to all Harry
