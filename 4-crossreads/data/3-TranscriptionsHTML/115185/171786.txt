<p>3 &ndash; here. Gibson wants to get to the front &ndash; but I'm sure they wont let him go with one eye. He doesn't like the idea of army service corps but it's better than being in the Tanks.<br/>I think it would be harder to get Gibson transferred to N.S.W. troops than to get him a commission in army service corps here.<br/>Much love<br/>Devoted daughter<br/>Betha</p>
