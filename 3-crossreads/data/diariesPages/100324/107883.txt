18/9/15 Gallipoli
to view with every light glowing and their vivid red crosses. What a cargo of pain is on a hospital ship! Abdul woke up again this afternoon and started to play hell. Artillery opened and bombardment made it hot for us. Right up at Suvla we could see them getting it too. Suddenly the shelling stopped and they opened heavy rifle fire and machine gunning. Bayonets were shown over their parapets and there was every indication of an attack. We replied with steady fire at their parapets and until they stopped. Two aeroplanes up. Shrapnel bullets dropping round. While talking with Hogarth one hit him but was stopped by a pocket book. A few casualties ? one man's eye blown out. Bde Major rang up but phones were useless on account
