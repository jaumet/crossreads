<p>during the night but didn't do any damage. No bombs at all during the night. Fritz must have gone to Blighty.</p>
<p>Saturday 17.8.18<br/>Went out salvaging all sorts of stuff after lunch 'till 6.30.pm. Played cards afterwards. Fritz didn't shell us all day, but put over some at 10.30pm. Again no bombs.</p>
<p>Tuesday 18.8.18<br/>More salvaging. Not a bad job. Had to get the men to bury 4 dead Fritz. They had been in the trench since the 8th. No work in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Monday 19.8.18.<br/>Had a job at Div. H.Q. Had to make paths etc. It was a rotten job. Had to keep dodging heads all the time. Scriven came back from Paris leave.</p>
<p>Tuesday 20.8.18<br/>Back on Salvage work. Had to bury another Fritzer. Found one or two odds &amp; ends. Another Aussie mail in. Do me, altho'</p>
