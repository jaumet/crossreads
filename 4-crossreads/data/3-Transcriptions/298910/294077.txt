<p>shell shock etc &ndash; Three fellows that used to carry with me have gone off with shell shock "Penfold, Weeks &amp; Hand". In my wildest dreams, I never thought war meant anything 'like this' &ndash; our feet are always wet, our clothes are all over mud &amp; we are getting very poor rations &ndash; it is almost unbearable we have to sleep anywhere &amp; on the whole line there's not a decent dug out that would stop a shell, we certainly would all strike to a man on any other mission, tucker or no tucker &ndash; wet or dry &ndash; cold etc, the only thing that keeps us going is our poor <u>cobbers</u>, who are so helpless when wounded &ndash; What a different tune the ignoramuses sing now of Stretcher Bearers. I haven't had a decent sleep for a week. Had many narrow escapes today &ndash; many H.E. burst within 50 yds of me &ndash; have been hit with scraps of shrapnel &amp; covered with mud. Saw two of our Aeroplanes brought down after an exciting air dud with a Taub &ndash; one poor fellow just dropped plane &amp; all within our lines - &amp; within 10 seconds he was just a charred mass, as he touched the ground there was just one violent explosion &amp; flames finished this sad sight. Two Taubs brought down later. The weather is all against us or the Boys would be in</p>
