  
 July 1915 
 at Brigade HQrs, but weren't wanted till 10 pm.  There was a lot more shrapnel - several men of the 4th LH were killed & wounded.  The guard which consists of 24 men & an officer of the  2nd LH Brigade & the same number of NZealanders embarked on a trawler at 1 pm & got away from Anzac at  8 am Saturday 31st .  We reached Imbros Is about noon & found a fine harbour with several supply ships cruisers, battleships monitors (3 of the latest pattern with 14 in guns) & a couple of destroyers.  There is a lot of activity here - thousands of Tommies.  We marched round to Genl HQrs & got donkies to carry our packs.  We were issued with new clothes, burnt our old ones & had a good swim.  There is plenty of fresh water here, so after a good wash & new clothes we all felt new men again.  Turned in early for a good sleep
