<p>Friday Sept. 21.  Had very little sleep last night.  For one thing an overcoat only is hardly sufficient to keep one warm.  I left my Blankets behind in my Pack.  Slept next to Bluey Roberts, the chap who arrived from Base with Roy Wooler.  We turned out about 4.15, &amp; had Break. which was brought up in an Ambulance.  Tea &amp; Porridge.  It was very acceptable.  We walked along to Shrapnel Corner &amp; got aboard motor lorries, which took us through YPRES to our A.C.S.  It was a most interesting trip, as we saw the remains of the Cathedral &amp; the famous Cloth Hall.  They are now only a heap of ruins.  From the A.C.S. we came along to the Left R.A.P. with a load of stretchers.  There were dead horses &amp; mules everywhere &amp; it gave us a gentle reminder that a War was on.</p>
<p>We saw 2 Aeroplanes brought down, one of ours &amp; one of Fritz's.  The general opinion was that they banged into one another.</p>
<p>After fossicking around for a while we got orders to send   <strike>26</strike> 16 men out to relieve the Reg. Bearers.<br/>Pill Box R.A.P.  28 Batt. Capt. Harper.  We had to remove about a dozen dead Germans before we took over the Pill Box.  It is very strongly built of re-inforced concrete.  The walls are about 2 ft 6 thick. It is about 18 feet square &amp; about 6 ft high.  The roof is built of iron girders &amp; about 4 feet of concrete on top of that.  Visited various other Pill Boxes in the vicinity in search of souvenirs.  Found a few, but a crowd of Infantry got in before us &amp; had their pick.</p>
