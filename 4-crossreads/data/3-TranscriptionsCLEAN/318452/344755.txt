Hollebeck. 2 Australian Divisions the 1st & 2nd were allotted a line embracing Glenense wood and Nonne Boschen wood while their 3rd objective was a line from north of Polygon wood through the wood to a point, about half a mile below, and embracing some very heavily fortified country. German "Pill Boxes" - great concrete forts - built of steel & concrete feet thick & bristling with machine guns were studded here & there over the ground to be won. These forts strong as they were availed little against the hurricane of shells poured into them. Huge shells thundered at them from our 12 & 15 inch guns & split them & battered them out of actionThe Barrage was the most effective
