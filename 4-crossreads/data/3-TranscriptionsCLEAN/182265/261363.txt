In billet at Madame Richomme's, Lisbourg. I have a comfortable well ventilated room & very clean. Madame has her daughter & the daughter's children living here. Her son in law is at the war. They are all very obliging. On the night of 29th Aug. we were relieved by 16th Manchesters. After a tiresome & muddy march we had hot soup at Brigade canteen & then came on to Neuve Eglise where we stayed two one nights. Here we all had a bath and a clean change of clothing which were very much appreciated by us all. On the 1st. September we were billted near Vieux Berquin having arrived here on evening of 31st.
