A large amount of her side blown away, 40 x 20 ft of her starboard side & managed to be towed in under a powerful escort. The hospital transport Glenmore Castle departed this day full of invaladed English soldiers from Palastine for England. 
 12 A convoy of 9 large cargo steamers left for England at 9 am. When 3 miles from the entrance a submarine was sighted. A sloop & the North Star, a auxiliary cruiser formally Mr Vanderbilt's yacht (the American millionaire) dropped some heavy depth charges, which could be felt very distinct on our ship moored inside the harbor. (Result unknown). The column of water & black smoke arose fully a hundred feet high. The mine sweepers whilst sweeping for mines found two in the channel & brought same to the surface & fired on them causing them to explode with a terrible force about 2 miles off the port entrance. Laid by some submarines during the night. Took the crew of 2 of our lifeboats for boat & sail drill & also swimming sport. A very pleasant afternoon sailing amongst the shipping & ships of war.
