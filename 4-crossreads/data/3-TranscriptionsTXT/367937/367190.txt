Down in the gully further over to the right of the Sphinx are the tombs of the kings all big vaults they say but I had not time to go over.  We never had time for anything hardly but we saw a lot:  you could put in a week out there and take hundreds of photos.The sphinx is rather a hideous looking monster with its nose knocked which they say was done by Napoleon firing a shot at it with a cannon.  Is that true do you know?We then mounted our various hack;, rode round the Sphinx and then up to the big Pyramid: Going up the two of us on our Camel gave the other chaps a race.  I was sitting in front and as I only had one bit of rope to do all the steering with it was rather exciting; however the camel seemed to know where to go so we both worked our heels like anything and yelled "Higgery" (Hurry up! They hardly pronounce the H) and we got a real good toot out of him bu and beat the others badly.When we got up we decided to have a look inside the Pyramid but we only had about 15 minutes to do it in.  When we got there we were fairly mobbed by guides as each person has to have one to go in and they do rook you.  Mine told me his name was McKenzie and when he started he said "Proceed McDuff": and He was a very dirty looking nigger and he said I could pay him what I liked but he managed to screw 8 Pts out of me before he finished and told me a doleful tale about his large family etc.
