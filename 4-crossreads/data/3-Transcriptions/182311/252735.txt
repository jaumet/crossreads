<p>or a hunger for War Trophies, or perhaps a desire to appear (as they did) amongst their comrades as Super-soldiers?&nbsp; It might have been any of these, but I do not think so. Rather, I think, it was the old lure of Romance; that &#39;twain, Mystery and Adventure which had lured our pioneers, hardiest sons of a hardy nation to our own Southern Land, now sent their descendants &quot;Over the top&quot; - Raiding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Mystery, born of the night when the perilous reconn-aissance of No Man&#39;s Land was made; mystery as the Scouts stealthy crawling along the enemy entanglements, heard the movement of our enemy, the handling of arms, footsteps on duckboards, his speech and even his songs as some incautious sentry cheered his lonely vigil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And Mystery of Mysteries, when on the night before the raid, the enemy entanglements, smashed by our trench-mortars had to be examined and a gap proved before the raid could be launched, when with caution, mud and slime from head to foot, the scouts, silent as shadows and almost as elusive, elbowed, crawled and sidled their way through &quot;The Gap&quot; and close to the enemy parapet.&nbsp; Mystery still, when on the night of the big Raid (for that is what the men of the 38th Battalion will always all the Raid of February 27th 1917) noislessly with blackened faces 350 raiders left the safe cover of the friendly trenches, crawled out over the parapet, through our own scanty wire to lie up cold,<s>and</s> still, and silent awaiting Zero Minute.</p>
