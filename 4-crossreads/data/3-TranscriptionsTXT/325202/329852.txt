survived the early washing & after 11 days there had a week in the Con. Camp & have been back in Base Details about 4 days waiting for another draft.
April 16/17This morning on early morning parade my name was called out amongst others mostly old 1st Division men for the next draft up the line & I am not sorry to be off again as we are all bored with the monotony of this camp life - the little we do has no interest in it & we are all prepared to put up with the mud & hard work in return for the comparative freedom of action up the line where one gets about ones work without eternally 'shunning' & 'Stan at easing'
