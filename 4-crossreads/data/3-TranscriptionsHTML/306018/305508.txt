<p>March 1918  April<br/>Monday 1st April<br/>Got 1 letter only in the Australian mail from Doug.  Cant understand why some letters have not arrived.  2 mails have been missed now.  Usual morning work.  Went to the picnic in the afternoon.  There were 14 or 15 of us at the Pyramids altogether &amp; we had some good fun &amp; took plenty of grub etc.  Felt very tired when I got home.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2nd April<br/>No further particulars as to the casualties in the Regt have been received, but Corp Marriott who was to have relieved me here is in hospital.</p>
