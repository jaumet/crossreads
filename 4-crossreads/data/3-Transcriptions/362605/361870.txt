<p>lovely fruit that you were buying &amp; eating, but I hope to share them with you &amp; also to taste our fruit from our very own trees this summer.</p>
<p>I was astonished to hear of poor Marion's death.  It is an awful occurrence when she was so young &amp; all the world before Her.</p>
<p>What rot about Billy getting married.  Billy Allison is here in this camp with me &amp; is my constant companion as ever, &amp; is no more married than I am.  I shall <u>not</u> be marrying.  I have met one Girl here that I would have married, but everyone writing, "Don't bring an English wife out", deferred my action, &amp; I have lost perhaps the best woman that I have ever met.  It does not matter very much though.  I can be quite happy, single; I shall have to work very hard when I get back &amp; I shall not want to be running about with Girls anymore;  I am past that stage now &amp; have my own hobbies to occupy my time fully &amp; contentedly.</p>
