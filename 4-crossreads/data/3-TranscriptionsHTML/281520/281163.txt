<p>Tent Camp Bapaume Rd near Le Barque<br/>21/3/17<br/>Had need to rise about 3 am and found the ground two inches deep in snow.  Early parties commenced to march down to Bazentin for bathing and the camp was comparatively empty all day.  Very cold squalls and a couple of powdery snow storms during the day.  Men needed their bath as their bodies and clothes were quite lousy and some backs nearly raw with their scratching.  Today in Bapaume  a Taube was brought down with Prince Leopold aboard.  He made an attempt to get away and our fellows shot him through the body &ndash; not expected to live.  The wrecked plane was loudly cheered as it passed.</p>
<p>Traffic much diminished on roads today and control better organised.  Furphies insistent that we are going into rest and move to Mametz on 25th.  Being idle had several discussions with Dr on abstract subjects such as Conversation, Universe etc etc  and with him did some French in the evening.  Bitterly cold evening and night.  Staff Capt. down and well primed.  [indecipherable] got his walking ticket to join the 65th Battalion and Elmiger &amp; Greig are now at Bazentin</p>
