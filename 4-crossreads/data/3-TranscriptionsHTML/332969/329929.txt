<p>On Sunday the 25th when we woke we found ourselves surrounded by a number of small islands which were like small mountains towering into the sky. an hour later we reached the heads of Port Albany," Western Australia. It was a very pretty sight it took us about an hour to go from the heads up to the "Jetty", and during that time we had church service, we also had the Band playing. Just before we reached the Jetty we seemed to be passing between two high walls of rocks &amp; they seemed to be only a few yards away from the boat. When we reached the Jetty it was about 11.Am. &amp; by the time we got close by &amp; were made fast it was 12 pm. Their were not many people on the Wharf only a few children at 12.30pm the Mail steamer arrived from "Fremantle," bound for Sydney there was great cheering which I will never forget the Jetty is only just room enough for a double line of Railway to run along it is very small <strike>gauge</strike> guage only 3Ft 6" about the same as Queensland railways. as near as I can say so we were quite close to the Mail boat there we a good few passengers, a rough guess 350 they only stayed a couple of hours to pick up &amp; drop the Mails.</p>
