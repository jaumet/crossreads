<p>after the hell of camp life. Getting killed is, to my friend and myself, the least terrible part of soldiering &ndash; I wonder will we think the same when we are at hand shakes with Death. Be that as it may, this evening has been delightful.</p>
<p>Feb: 27<br/>Visit the Arab Museum with my friend Bell &ndash; we do not know enough of archaeology to fully appreciate this Museum.</p>
<p>Feb: 28<br/>Visit Mena Camp to see my friend Whitehouse; also see the 11th and 12th Battalions and others leave for the Front;</p>
<p>March  1<br/>Visit Cairo</p>
<p>Mar: 2<br/>Flag wagging. Studies at Caf&eacute; Saulte.</p>
<p>Mar: 3<br/>Manoeuvres &ndash; leave camp 8 a.m. rest 9 a.m. march to second tower. 1.35 p.m. attack across the Desert,  3 o'clock march nine miles across the sand without a rest &ndash; what this means, only those who have been through it can fully appreciate.<br/>Altogether we have done something over 20 miles to-day. Reach camp 7 p.m.<br/>To Heliopolis; though dead tired feel I must get out of camp.</p>
<p>Mar: 4<br/>Flag wagging. Studies at a Caf&eacute;, Heliopolis.</p>
<p>Mar:  5 &ndash; 6<br/>Manoeuvres &ndash; leave camp 9.30 a.m. return 4 p.m.  March out again 8.30 p.m. march all night and entrench &ndash; the cold is so awful that it is agonizing.  Fighting all day &ndash; return to camp &ndash; march 10 miles without a rest; these have been the most fatiguing manoeuvres we have ever done. In the evening</p>
