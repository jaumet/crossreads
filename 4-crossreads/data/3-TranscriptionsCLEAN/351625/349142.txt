At Sea
Dear Mother,
We are on the water once again & seem to be going straight into bad weather.  I am keeping very well on it.  I think we are going to make a pretty quick voyage to England.  We expect to reach another port in about four days.  I cannot write more than a card to you this time as we are restricted to 50 words.  This is my third letter home & I hope you get them all.  I hope you are all keeping well.  We passed several vessels this morning which is more than we saw on the whole of the first trip.
