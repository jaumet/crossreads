know how I am doing please, she will no doubt be anxious about me, I havn't got half the dose I had last time & am getting excellent attention, this is a first-class place also.The Doc in charge of this ward is Dr Spencer-Young, he one time practised at Grafton when Jarvie Hood was at Maclean & knows our family he is a fine old chap.I hope you received my cable & previous letters I sent since being wounded.Well dear I will close with fondest love to self, R & BfromKen
