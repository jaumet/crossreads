 Went for a long walk to MEX where Napolean landed when he took Alexandria. I had for company an A.I.F. Priest, who talked a lot of the coming Revolution in England!!!!  I wonder is he right. [The remainder of the page crossed through.]  He also decided that the masses of labourites would insist on peace before another Winter War. 
 I sleep for 2 hours after lunch & so the day is put thro' waiting waiting - a great waste of time & money but a good change & but for my Bronchitis I would be A.1.
