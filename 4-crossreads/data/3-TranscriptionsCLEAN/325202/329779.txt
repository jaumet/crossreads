 April 23/16 Easter Sunday - Doilleu We arrived here late yesterday afternoon on the pouring rain - soaked through & covered in mud. "Here" is a large roadside farmhouse about a mile from the village - it is also an "Estaminet" or inn & we are billeted in the various outbuildings wherever we can get in. It reminds one of the old song "Fifteen of us on the parlour floor" except the parlour is a disused stable. 
 It wasn't very long we were crowded into the kitchen & Madame was at the stove frying eggs  if  as if her life depended on it
