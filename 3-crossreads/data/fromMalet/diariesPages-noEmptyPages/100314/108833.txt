1/2/18 Desvres
They fixed me up with a billet at a house of a woman whose husband is a Lieut. in the French Army, and a prisoner of War in Germany. Two little old fashioned kids. Chatted away to the family in execrable French and Madam made some coffee and an omelette. A lively person this and she speaks a bit of English. The children showed me their school books and their dolls. the bedroom is a small one upstairs and is void of any religious pictures at all ? rather unusual in this part of France. A neighbour looked in and we had a yarn together. The French get on better with us because we are sociable and polite to them and not proud and standoffish like the English whose manners ways they cannot understand.
