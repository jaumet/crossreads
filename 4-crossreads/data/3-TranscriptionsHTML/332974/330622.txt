<p>German Concentration Camp,<br/>Liverpool, June 28th 1916.<br/>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We as representatives of Three hundred and sixty (360) men, interned at Torres Island, South Australia, have resolved, that Mr Emde shall conduct the present inquiry in the same way as he has done up to now. Every facility, as to witnesses giving evidence will be given to him, and the evidence of such witnesses will be the same , as if nothing had happened so far. We beg to state: that witnesses now coming before the Court will give their evidence in toto, but everyone and all of us wish to protest, that we are not allowed to include in this inquiry the incident of "Flogging Prisoners of War while tied, hand cuffed and stripped," and we beg of you that such protest is especially remarked and noted in the depositions.</p>
<p>We further wish to ask of you, to put yourself into communications with the Authorities who represent our interests, viz. the Consul General of U.S.A. or the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Washington, by cable, to get instructions for a new inquiry to be held relating to the Flogging Incident", as long as all witnesses required for this case are present. We further wish to ask you that all the evidence at present admissible from each and every one of our fellow prisoners should be heard and taken down in the depositions. We trust that you give due consideration to these, our requests and thanking you in anticipation for services rendered and to be rendered.</p>
<p>We remain, Dear Sir,<br/>Respectfully yours</p>
<p>Siegmund I Villiers</p>
