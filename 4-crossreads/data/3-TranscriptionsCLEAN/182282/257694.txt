 Re  Lt  Kenneth Binnie 
 The Followin brief Summary of my 
 Father War Service were taken from 
 his 1916, 17, 18 and 19 Diaries 
   
 At the Outbreak of War Dad was managing 
 4D. Alan had won a scholarship to 
 Wxford and the rest of the Family 
 (including Struan) had gone to visit him. 
   
 Being a "man of the times" Dad was 
 extremely anxious to "Get Away" and 
 this was the subject of many letters 
 to his parents during 1915 beseaching 
 them to come home and relieve 
 him of his management duties so that 
 he could do this. 
   
 January 1916 saw him finally get his 
 wish and he enlisted as a 
 Gunner in the 7 th  Field Artillery Brigade 
 which were being formed at "the 
 Warren" /Camp near  Holsworthy  Tempe. 
   
 At the time he was courting my mother, 
 Linda Lloyd, who was a Sydney girl.  and  
 Her family provided a welcome venue 
 for him on his frequent leave breaks. 
 Apart from leave breaks they looked after 
 their Horses, which were carefully selected, 
 cleaned the guns and Harnesses - which 
 he complained "rusted while you 
 watched". 
   
 The 7 th  F.A.B. embarked on the "Argylshire" for 
 England on 11 th  May - they had an enjoyable 
 & less eventful voyage with plenty of 
 good companionship from North Western
