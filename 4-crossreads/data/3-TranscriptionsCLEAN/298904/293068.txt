There were some big strings of camels coming through here at times one mob I saw must have been 500 strong  Aeroplanes done nearly all the scouting here you could see them flying everywhere.I caught a snifter cold here & all my lips broke out, they were terribly painful & the dust used to aggravate them & make them much worse.I went to the Dr with my cold & he gave me a dose of thick castor oil it nearly made sick to look at it. & I had to close my eyes & gulp the horrible slimy stuff down somehow, I would nearly as soon take posion poison as that horrible stuff again
