 days busy arranging their costumes etc. they had a great time at the Y.M.C.A. Hut. Most of the sisters went   &  they all had a very jolly time. They danced until 9 p.m. Some of the Sisters got up too but I had on thick boots so had to deny myself the pleasure. They were all very excited   &  had a bonza time. Quite a number of convalencent patients took part.
The Hut is a great success. The other day a Cricket Match between Patients   &  Sisters   &  it was very good. Of course I'm not a cricket player.
