<p>by who informed us it was an old preaching cross many hundreds of years old and immediately opposite to it is a church over a thousand years old. These old churches were originally Catholic but now belong to various other denominations, mostly Anglican.<br/>The original "Spreading Chestnut Tree" of world-wide renown is still standing together with the Smithy, in a small village named "Fehldeen" about two miles away. I haven't visited the spot yet but intend doing so to-night. The twilights are so long - light until 9 p.m. - that there is plenty of time for long walks after tea.<br/>Another interesting walk I took was out to the Aerodrome near here. It was a wonderful sight to see them gliding up into the air and sailing down with the greatest ease. In about five minutes after rising they are a mere speck on the horizon. The Flying Corps, of which there are a very large number, mostly mechanics, have very fine quarters, and a splendid sports ground. As myself and friend were there at tea time we had a very good meal at their Canteen.<br/>I hope to send you some more photos in a couple of days. I am forwarding, by even post,<br/>a small trinket which might be useful for mother of Kit about the house. It caught my eye at the time but on further investigation is very frail</p>
