<p>FEB. &nbsp; WEDNESDAY 16 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine. On the guns in the morning &nbsp;At 12 oclock parade they called for volunteers to picket the Central Station &amp; I stepped out amongst 102 others from 15/1. We were given a hot meal at 4 oclock and left in special trams about 6.15. We were &nbsp;served out with service rifles and 20 rounds ball ammunition per man. We went to the Victoria Barracks &amp; the other units were served out with rifles &amp; ammunition &nbsp;We went back to the Central in trams &amp; picketed every entrance till 1 AM &amp; then had a special train back to Tempe. Nobody man, woman or child was allowed on the station without a ticket. The crowd was very quiet as a whole &amp; beyond using the butt of the rifle half a dozen times, nothing happened at all exciting</p>
