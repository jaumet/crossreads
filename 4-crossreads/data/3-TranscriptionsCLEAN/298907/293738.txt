  
 Had a row with the Commandant this morning it happened this way, one of the nurses came up to my ward & said Sgt. The Commandant wants to see you in her office, I wondered what could be the matter, so down I went & knocked at her door, there was a surly "come in" & in I hopped & walks up to her prepared for anything, she starts off "Sgt I want you to take charge of the route marching party from now on & see that they do their work properly especially the men for exercise you will have to put them through physical training & see that they do it, this had the effect of course of making me obstinate for I am not going to be ordered about by a woman
