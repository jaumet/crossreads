<p>At Kautara it is reported that we have taken 4000 prisoners. I don't know whether it is so, it is probably somewhere near that. The fellows left in camp here had a thin time the night before last, strays were lobbing all over the camp  &amp;  big 6" high explosives not so very far off. The two fellows left in out tent had the audacity  &amp; impertinence to make a barricade our our kitbags in the tent to keep off the strays. To the west of the camp the air is heavy with the scent of dead horse &ndash; there are a great number of horses killed.</p>
