  
 tucker etc now & a great line of pipes bring water.  So we don't have to depend so much on camels as we used to.  They had to follow us with our drinking water in cans, horse feed & our own rations until the line was brought further out, so at times tucker & water was rather scarce. 
 If we push on now I've no doubt we will meet with more stubborn resistance from the Turks than heretofore, which is only natural as the country improves & lends itself to defence. 
 Got a letter from you yesterday, but it is a very old one, dated early in November.  Evidently been astray. 
 Will enclose another photo or two. Backhouse came back to us about 2 months ago, he looks & is pretty well. 
 Lots of love to everyone from loving son Jack
