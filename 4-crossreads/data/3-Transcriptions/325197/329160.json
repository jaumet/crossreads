<p>Got into the Ambulance and taken to No 53. C.C.S. On the way to the C.C.S. we changed motors, and where our wounds were again examined by a Doctor. After taking all particulars (such as, our unit, Rank, married or single etc. etc. the usual army questions) we had a tag tied on our tunic or in my case my braces as I had no tunic on. After that I was inoculated (against blood poison)</p>
<p>When we were finished with the Doctor the Y.M.C.A. had hot cocoa, biscuits and cigarettes waiting for us.</p>
<p>There was also a few wounded Germans waiting for the motor, and they received the same treatment as our boys, and the Y.M.C.A. also gave them refreshments.</p>
<p>Got into the motor &amp; passing through Villers Brettonneux, saw one of my old pals Billy Herbert.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the C.C.S. my wound was again examined</p>
