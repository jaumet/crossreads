<p>2 TUESDAY</p>
<p>Raining in evening, but fine all day.</p>
<p>Grooming horses all morning and</p>
<p>fixing our harness in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I was on the court of inquiry on the</p>
<p>death of the horse of ours that had</p>
<p>its leg broken. We&nbsp;are having</p>
<p>good tucker in the kitchen of a farm</p>
<p>house near here &amp; its not too</p>
<p>bad.</p>
