<p>February 1916<br/>night.  We had very little time to get ready &amp; under the circumstances turned out fairly well.  The picket went to the pictures at night.</p>
<p>Thursday 17th  Lt Smith, being orderly officer, I had to take the troop all day &amp; we had a fairly strenuous morning.  The Colonel was hovering around all the time.  He can be very critical &amp; sarcastic at times but I got off fairly light.  Our Squadron is also training to play football against "A" Squadron next Saturday.</p>
<p>Friday 18th  Applied for leave &amp; got it from 9 am.  with Sgt Conrick I went down to Tel-el-Kebir catching the 11 am express, arriving there at 1 pm.  Found Arthur Blomfield in the 1st Battalion &amp; we had a rare old yarn.  Watson was also with him.  I caught the 9.45 pm train back to Cairo &amp; reached Maadi about 2 am.</p>
<p>Saturday 19th  Cleaning up day in camp.  We shifted our line of tents &amp; got new mats for our tent.  It looks well now.  Was warned for main guard tonight &amp; put in nearly all</p>
