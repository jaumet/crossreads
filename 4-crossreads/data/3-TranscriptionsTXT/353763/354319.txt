I then said farewell to Father Fox & the Sisters who are doing real good work  -  I collected a fern new to me on a bank outside their gates & made for my launch at 6 pm  -
Father Fox can speak Fijian like a native  -  He learnt it in 3 amp; cd  speak in public in 6 months  -  He travels & observes both by land & water  -  He tells me that his band of missioners stick to Whites & Fijians while a separate band of clergy & Schoolmasters all make a speciality of Hindustain & the lifting on to a higher plane of our Indian subjects in Suva & the adjacent islands  -
After my strenuous aftn  -  I had a good dinner  -  Some bridge & some beer & then bed  -
