which Jerusalem in one stage, where we fed up and had tea, moving on again at about 9 P.M. and travelling as far as Khunet el Enab, which we reached at about 1 A.M. this morning.
25th Moved on again from Enab last night at 7-30, and travelled to Latroun, or to be correct opposite the village of Deir Eyoub, reaching there about 10-30 P.M. on the 24th. Moving along the mountain top between Enab and Soris was very pleasant. Dimly in the distance one could see the great plain stretching out to the Sea, and wonderfully cool was the breeze as it came in from the ocean. The view from there on a clear day is wonderful.
From there we descended continuously, with the hills gradually closing in on the road in the descent, till the long dusty column at last wriggled its way through the narrow defile past the ancient inn Bab el Ouad, and crept out onto the open country, the Deir Eyoub.

The night was close and absolutely still. The dust hung in heavy clouds as we journeyed. At about 3 A.M. on the 26th (to-day) we finished our journey at the Wadi Heinan about five or six miles from Rishon le Zion. This is a very beautiful place, orange orchards, heavy with their second crop are everywhere. We are camped just near an orchard and the Jewish owner has very kindly given the boys the use of one of his huge irrigation reservoirs as a swimming bath.
So with plenty of cheap fruit, a warm climate, an absence of dust, and plenty of water we are in luck's way. We are, I believe, having a considerable rest here, unless anything unforseen occurs. The pleasure of seeing green orchards, and signs of civilization again is indescribable after the heat, dust and misery in the arid regions of the Jordan Valley. We hope we have said goodbye to the Jordan forever.
26th August How vain are all one's hopes, after all. Here we
