<p>Go into Rest Station.</p>
<p>Jan 31<br/>Entrained, off 2 pm.  The day clear &amp; fine.  Hitchock, Turner Stableberg and I share a 4th or 5th class carriage.</p>
<p>Feb 1st.<br/>Still travelling in this confounded dog-box &ndash; bitterly cold.  Able to get a few extras at various canteens en route which adds to the usual ration.</p>
<p>Feb 2<br/>Arrived St. Germain 8 a.m.  Go into camp, Lyons not far but out of bounds, anyhow too tired to try any tricks.</p>
