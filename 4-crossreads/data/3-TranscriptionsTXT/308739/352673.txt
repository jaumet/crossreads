Tuesday 14 March 1916Regimental Parade & swimming is the order of to-day.Lieu. Cunningham of Post Office, Alexandria is now Capt. & is stationed at Cairo.  The postal work for Light Horse Men is now principally done at Port Tewfic on Suez Canal entrance.  The mail is taken direct off the mail Boats & sorted in a large Stone Building specially erected for the purpose, & then sent on to the different camps.
Wednesday 15 March 1916Reg. Parade today.  Swimming parties are formed under an Officer to proceed to Canal for Swimming.  The men thoroughly enjoy the outing.  Artists in the Regiments arrange the Name & place of the Brigade, with Stones & Sand on the Banks of Canal so all & sundry can distinguish the country we spring from.  There is very little currants in Canal which is strange, as two Great Oceans connect.
