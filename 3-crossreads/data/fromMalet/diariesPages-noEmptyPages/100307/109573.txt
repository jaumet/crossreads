16/3/17
A fine sunny day with continuous distant cannonade. We are just at the gates of Bapaume now and rumours are that Fritz is shelling it which looks like evacuation. O.P Hunt my batman is under open arrest having been pinched in Amiens while I was away. No woman could be more tender in her care of me than he is probably because he thinks all he does now will mitigate his punishment. I slapped 5 days No. 2 into him myself at on another charge. It will be hard looking after oneself after two years having had the entire services of full buck Australian Billjim who does no other work.
Miles went up forward to Battn HQ where they are on road and other work. It is not possible to ride up there well beyond the Butte. The returning empty limbers were cleaning out the dump near the station ? once in No Mans Land. It seems foolish to permit this seeing how hard it is to get stuff forward when mud is with us. A couple of aeroplanes over before lunch.
