<p>Wednesday 12th  After seeing my Sister in the Morning who was very cheerful and progressing slowly. I had Lunch at Holborn and caught a Tube as arranged out to Willesdew Green arriving there at 2 Pm and after making inquiries I arrived at the House and found my friends awaiting me. After a Cup of Tea and Cake, it being a nice day, we all went for a Tram ride out to Hendon to see the large Air-Craft Depot. Before the Was it was open fields and now it is all occupied making Airoplanes of all Sizes. Several large Planes were up for a Trial fly. We walked about until the Whistle's blew for knock off time and saw the large crowds coming out of the different works to catch their Trams and Bus'es home, it was a very interesting sight, they all have to line up two deep in long passage's and their is no bustling or jostleing. Their were about 12 Tram's waiting also several Buse's, which soon filled &amp; on their way. there is no mistake this Cue Bisiness is a splendid idea, and prevent's a large number</p>
