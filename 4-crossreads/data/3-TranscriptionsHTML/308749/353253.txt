While we were there a very good lot of steamers came in the sister boat to this one came in "The Thermosthenes" and a monitor and another armoured merchantman. The Harbour is not bad, the wharves are all in one, about 1 mile in length, and the sheds are 3 deep. There is a light-house and a concealed fort on a cliff called "The Bluff" just on the entrance to the Harbour.
