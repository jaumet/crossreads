  
 Monday 17 September 1917 
 Alex: Today I spent at the MOUZAM Gardens, & in the Orchid house. Alexandria is having one of their best "seasons", all Greeks etc. have made much money & spend it on clothes etc. - & jewellery. Every Hotel & Pension is full  from  of people from the interior or far away as the Soudan. 
 [The following paragraph crossed through.] Letter from Dolly today dated Aug. 30th. She did not know I'm on my way home. I was never so impatient at delay & for two pins I'd go into some Camp for duty but a few hours notice is all we get. Am reading Romany Rye & getting a lot of letters written I owe.
