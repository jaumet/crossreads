Dear Mrs. Jack,
A nice dirty bit of paper but every scrap of it is precious so I'm not going to waste it.
I'm not sure I like being a Pay Sergeant after all, of course I did for a little while, the work was different & it was promotion & things easier & more independent sort of.  But things the last few weeks or days have been most thrilling & interesting & exciting & I'm a sort of spectator whereas if I'd been in my last billet I'd have been right in the know.
However there's no use worrying, is there, one has to do what one is told, I find its the best way, for me anyhow.  But things are interesting just now, painfully so, you will be reading about it in the papers.
I can't tell you much more, in fact not so much.  We don't always know even here until after you, how things really are.  There are so many rumours, if you believe half what was told, well you'd go dilly.
