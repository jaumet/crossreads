<p>Dear Auntie<br/>I suppose you will be wondering what has become of me. I left Holdsworthy nearly a fortnight ago and am back here in the Light Horse. I expect to be down to see you on Sunday.</p>
<p>I was camped out at Roseberry Park all last week but couldnt get out to see you as I had forgotten the address and didnt have the letter with me. I had plenty of time off while I was down there too. I expect to be going on final leave next week as we will be sailing on or about the 23rd.</p>
<p>Well Auntie, I will close now hoping to see you all on Sunday.</p>
<p>With best love from<br/>Your affectionate Nephew<br/>Frank</p>
