<p>9 &ndash; we wont count on them till we see them. Our hospital is just full of dysentery Jaundice &amp; diarrhoea &ndash; very little pneumonia so far &ndash; a good deal of enteric fever &ndash; very few surgical cases if any. The Red Cross things have been invaluable work our bad bread &ndash; impossible for convalescent dysentery cases etc. The biscuits from Arnotts have been life saving. I have never eaten this bread since it made me ill the first try. It's quite sour. I live on biscuits bought at the canteen the ration biscuits are too hard.<br/>The tinned fruit &amp; Tomatoes, Red Cross, have been rushed &ndash; we have no vegetables her no potatoes perhaps for three days a month, we have them in our mess &ndash; we get them from a Greek greengrocer &ndash; But he has not always got enough for 105 sisters. No butter can you imagine how I eat bread &amp; butter when I went to lunch on the Minatonka on Sunday! I felt very materialistic &ndash; one realized how starved one is when biting good bread &amp; butter. Just think of our poor troops facing this winter with their poorly nourished bodies.</p>
