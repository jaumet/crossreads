They left about 16 feet of the base of it which always shows in pictures of the present lighthouse. We had a good look around the Hoe and Mr Johnson invited 
 me for tea to his residence. He showed me over his shops and work rooms. We then had tea, a long talk about Australia and I left catching a car for Devonport and from there another to the Hospital where I arrived in ample time to go to a concert in the school hall down stairs. During an interval in the concert tea, sandwiches and cakes were handed round. In Devonport I got a lot of views of Plymouth.
