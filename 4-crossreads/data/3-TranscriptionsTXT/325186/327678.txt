We arrived at Colombo on 24th May.  We dropped anchor about 2.0 am but slept on until 5 am when the chatter of the niggers woke us & we were soon on deck buying pineapples. There were plenty of ships of all descriptions in port & there seemed to be plenty of life ashore.  On 25th May all hands with the exception of the Battn went ashore in old Barges towed by tugs. The Battn went ashore on 26th & marched through the town & into the Barracks where we were locked in  Every men had a ticket given him for 1 pint of beer  We had about an hour eating pineapples & bananas. I bought some sauce & condensed milk & took it on board with me
