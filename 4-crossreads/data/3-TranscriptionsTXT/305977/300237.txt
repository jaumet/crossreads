 July 1915 till four 
 Thursday 15th Came back to our dug-outs at 6 &amp; slept or tried to till 12.  The afternoon was very hot.  B &amp; C Squadrons came out &amp; took over the trenches in front.  We had a fairly quiet night &amp; I managed to get in 4 hrs sleep in the bottom of the trench. 
 Friday 16th B &amp; C Squadrons got to work on their dug outs behind their support trenches.  John Turk could see us from their look out at Gaba Tepe &amp; he put in 4 high explosive shells.  We worked in the smaller portion after that.  I did a solid day with the pick &amp; shovel.  Was on covering party at night.  The Turks did a bit of firing &amp; tried to bomb us but they didn't get close enough.  Got relieved at 1am. 
 Saturday 17th We went into the trenches at 6pm &amp; came out at 6am.  Was on fatigue in the afternoon getting bags up from the beach for the new firing line. 
 Sunday 18th Went back into the trenches at 4pm.
