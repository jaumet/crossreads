<p>21/6/16  Wednesday</p>
<p>Rather hot &ndash; Yards &amp; Yards of orders read out. Some of sneaked over the side &amp; had a good swim &ndash; Capt Coppleson afterwards got permission for us to swim at our own risk. Capt Coppleson got up a Boxing tournament &amp; I entered &amp; got a man a lot heavier, he only had one hit, but it was a good un &amp; my ribs are very painful if not broke &ndash; he threw in the Towel in the 5th as I peppered him from his chin to back of neck. There is some very hot stuff on board &amp; I don't think I will venture further in the tournament. The Officers arranged a Concert on Deck for us. Still lying in Harbour &ndash; all sort of rumours.</p>
