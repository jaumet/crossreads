Ribemont
25/1/17 Very small morning parade owing to so many men being detached. Had the officers up and chose some ground for afternoon's work and then went in. Very cold and snow still on the ground. German prisoners camp is guarded by young 
Tommies of fighting age and one Fritz seems to have one Tommy to look after him. In the afternoon put out a picture of new French attack system on a two company front (in all 260 ft) and by the time this was finished the hour was 3.30. At 6 went out to some high ground west of the village to see the new S.O.S. demonstrated but through some mess up it was not sent up. At our billet there were some visitors tonight a pretty little tot of 6 named Andette Vacette who was told by Madam to come and shake hands with Monsieur le Commandant and in the sweetest way, put up her small face to be kissed. The old man here and the farmhand are both very unwashed and dirty and their work in the midden heap does not tend to make them any better. Madam has many other elderly dames call in to console with her in her son's death "pour la France" and say how sad it is
