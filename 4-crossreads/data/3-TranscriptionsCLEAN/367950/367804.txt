 After nearly a months wandering we have got so far. This is an ideal spot. A gem of the ocean. Streets nicely laid out - clean, large shops. Everyone busy, no idling about like Towns in Egypt, no filth, clean race of people these Cingalese. The most beautiful heads of hair of any race I have ever seen. Their coiffure is simply wonderful they use cocoa-nut oil on the hair and their hair is black and shiny and all the men wear their hair long like a women and usually worked into a "bun" at the back. Most curious effect to a European and they all wear semi-circular hair combs like those used by small girls in European countries. The hair is well brushed back and the comb inserted hats are only worn by Cingalese in good positions.
