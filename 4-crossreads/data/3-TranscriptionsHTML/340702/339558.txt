<p>30/4   Green letter to Mac. Card to Ciss</p>
<p>1/5   Went to Villers-Bocage today. Shall have to go there tomorrow on Armstrong Huts for Headquarters. Letter from Parsons (Paris) today. While at Villers-Bocage, I heard a French Band (Chasseurs). Their trumpeter made quite a fine display they have small banners on their trumpets and look very flash.</p>
<p>4/ 5   Took on a new job at the Dump today. Stayed up with the searchlight unit last night to witness it operating on German Planes, but came a Gutser, Fritz not coming over. The French Artillery moved on last night. Some French Colonial Infantry with a Greenish, Khaki uniform passed through the village today. A regular Tank parade up to the line is held here every night, it is very funny to see the ungainly monsters struggling along, anything from a dozen to a score in Single file.</p>
<p>10.5.18  The Enthusiastic Fritz sneaked over at Break of day this morning and Bombed our Dump scoring 6 direct Hits. We had erected some camouflage screening. He evidently thought that there was something wrong &amp; he done his best to rectify things in his own particular way.  Wrote two letters today 1 to E.M.M.&amp;B. Coy &amp; another to our Company O.C.. By the way one of those Bombs riddled the Cookhouse, one tent, &amp; a Hessian Camping Shed with Shrapnel without causing one casualty. The occupants all sleeping on the Ground, this undoubtedly saved many of them</p>
