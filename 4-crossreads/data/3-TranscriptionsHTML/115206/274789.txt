<p>Villers Brettoneaux. Bty Position<br/>Early during the morning Fritz had a mad minute barrage.<br/>Ken Gunn left with Sheedy for L'aison. Fritz fired a large dump of S.A.A. and big stuff quite handy. He also set a few stretches of camouflage a fire near a gun position. Weather fine and looks like holding for awhile. I hope it does. Best luck to the stunt tomorrow.</p>
