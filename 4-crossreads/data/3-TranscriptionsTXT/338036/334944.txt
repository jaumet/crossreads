 Friday 31st Still raining 
 September Saturday 1st morning &ndash; not raining but cloudy.  9th Brigade Sports today at a village nearby.  Saw tug of war in which the rope was broken.  About midday it began to rain &amp; continued for rest of day. 
 Sunday 2nd Signs of clearing.  At night it was clear &amp; signs of aeroplanes could be heard.  Anti aircraft guns could also be distinguished.  Walk to village of Thiembronne in afternoon. 
 Monday 3rd Spent all the morning washing waggons for transport and got a wetting.  To day was an excellent clear day with good sun &ndash; the first for over a week.  At night to Thiembronne &amp; met Freddy Clark on return journey.  Am very dissatisfied at treatment by certain L/C in our section &ndash; Witt.  Quite unreasonable to expect men to work under him.  Same applies to other NCOs &amp; also WO.  At night it was excellent clear sky &amp; bright full moon.  Fritz came over bombing &amp; the sound of his engine could be distinctly heard.  Flashes of shrapnel could be seen also.
