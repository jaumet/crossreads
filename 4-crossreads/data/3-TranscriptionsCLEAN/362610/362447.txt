  
 Saturday 19 August 1916 Right through the night was in the dug-out in the advanced position really acting as orderly officer to the General. In replying to our very intense bombardment the Huns sent a few shells very close to us, but the possey was quite safe. The attack was only partially successful, our own artillery fire really doing a lot to hinder our advance : the 4th Bn. reached their objectives & gained some ground, but the 3rd were held up. Casualties were heavier in the former. About 6 o'clock in the morning returned to our Bde. H.Q. in Sausage Valley. Forgot to say that during the stunt a runner arrived with 4 or 5 letters for me amongst his messages : they were a fine treat. Helping with intelligence work during the morning & immediately after lunch was sent back to Albert to fix up billets for the brigade. Had not much trouble but was kept waiting until after 11 o'clock for the units to arrive. Then turned in abt. midnight. Day had been finer, with only one or two showers.
