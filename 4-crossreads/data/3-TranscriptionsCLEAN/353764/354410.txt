  
 it was the funniest trip on record. You should have seen Jack going for the nick of his life on a Donkey all day.  Such expressions as "If they could only see us at home now" & many others alluding to Home people were very frequent & tended to make the day enjoyable. We caught the 4.30 pm train home, had Tea in Heliopolis & arrived back very tired. 
 21.2.16 Monday & 22.2.16 Tuesday Two days of ordinary routine work.  Our O.C. went down to Head Quarters at Ishmalia to see what is to become of our Company & rumour has it that we are to stay in Heliopolis for another 3 months.  I would sooner be here, than down there as the whole place is alive with Lice & there is very little water to have a decent wash. I went into Cairo with Jack & his friends & drove through the various Bazaars.  Jack purchased a Fez & of course is mad to wear the thing.  I bought a couple of hand bags which I will send to-day. 
 23.2.16 Wednesday & 24.2.16 Thursday
