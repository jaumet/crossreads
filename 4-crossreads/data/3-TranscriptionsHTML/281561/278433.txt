<p>27/9/17.<br/>Ordered to rejoin the unit today. The School broke up after a hurried examination. Rejoined the Company at their billet a few miles away. Collected some mail. Went to Steenvorde for the evening.<br/>29/9/17.<br/>Working with the Platoon. Showing them some stunts no word of my being gazetted yet; though I do the work. On parade today the Colonel gave us the "dinkum oil". There is trouble before us.<br/>30/9/17.<br/>A Churchparade this morning where the padre piled on the agony about being killed in action. Then we moved this afternoon, to a point near Dickebusche, being comveyed in motor buses along the Ypres road. Have possies in the old trenches.</p>
