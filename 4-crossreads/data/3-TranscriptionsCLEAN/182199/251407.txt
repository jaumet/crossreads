 to relate he was not spared to see the action through.  He was killed at about 4.30 a.m. on the morning of the 19th May.   Death was instantaneous and was caused by a splinter of a shell piercing his head.  His body was reverently buried the following morning Chaplain McKenzie of the 4th battalion officiating at the graveside.  Needless to say his loss is keenly felt in the regiment.  Personally the loss is very severe.  We had been closely associated in the same company since the regiment was formed and had become good friends. 
 (I [ ] details about his personal belongings). 
 If I am spared through this campaign I will call on  you and give  you any information I can.  Again deploring the loss of a brave soldier. 
 Yours sincerely
