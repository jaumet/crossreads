a flower garden all around.  We have a big orchard on the main land & I suppose that we will be able to buy some fruit.  The government Launch goes to town twice a day so we can always get anything we want.  Bill has just been nabbed to go & help the Sergeant while Ellis & I are sitting in the Cottage.  We will all get our turn though.  We have two bonza Captains & one Lieutenant & 3 Sergeants all good men.  Capt. Bray the Commander is always smiling & walks about & talks to us just like a private.  He is with us 4 days & the other 3 days he is at L'pool.  We have about 150 patients & there are some Characters amongst them.  One of them just passed me on the way up to their camp.  He had a linen collar, a pair of shorts & a wristlet watch.  While we were waiting at L'pool, the patients ran along the line & caught three goats but they let them go again just before we left L'pool.  They tied kerosene tins on the back of the train with wire & had the outside of the railway carriages festooned with sanitary paper.  We have just got a supply of meat so we will not have bully beef to-night.  It is beautiful up here.  The views are glorious & at 4 o'clock every day we have the baths to ourselves.  Of course we can go in any time for a shower but the baths will do me.  I am writing in Ted Grundy's notebook.  He is a cousin of Mrs. Clarke's next-door neighbour & a lady I know well.  Billy also knows her.  Casson is here but is a bit of a loafer but the other fellows are shaking him up about it.  We will not be getting any leave except our final of 4 days & then we will be off to Malta direct.
