<p>We hope Alice and yourself are bearing bravely the awful load of grief with which you have been burdened; and which no friend or relation can mitigate, notwithstanding their willingness to do so.</p>
<p>We are all well. &ndash; Jack leaves here for Chicago this week to fill a position offered him by the General Electric Company, the largest concern of its kind in America. He was notified that he would shortly be transferred to either New York or London.</p>
<p>Give our love to Alice and Dorothy, and hoping more than I can say</p>
<p>I remain<br/>with sincerest sympathy<br/>your loving brother<br/>John A Ferguson</p>
