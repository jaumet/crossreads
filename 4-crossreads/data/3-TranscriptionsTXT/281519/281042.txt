Ribemont21/1/17 Church parade 10.30 on ground near Sucrerie. Men fairly smart in greatcoats and drill order. Afterwards marched past General Smyth V.C. who took the salute. Ground still frozen quite hard and deep in hard snow. Had a haircut and a hot bath during the afternoon. Vey cold and a great scarcity of coal so bed is the warmest place for one.  Asked Madam if she had been to mass and she said no because her son was dead and she did not intend to enter Church again. Killed in action. The light has gone out of the lives of the two poor old folk. In the evening went to Bde HQ and had a talk with Plant on various topics. Dark streets with groups of soldiers talking and here and there a busy illuminated estaminet crowded to the doors. Trees bare of leaf and sombre in colour show up black against the snow and make a dreary scene. No wonder that Spring and its advent are so much welcomed by these old world people and their writers.
