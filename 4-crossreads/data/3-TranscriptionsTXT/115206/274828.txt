 September 1918. Sunday 15 
 In Reserve. Hebecourt Weather glorious. A beautiful spring day. Fritz planes across during the morning. Rumor, we are moving again tomorrow. Played 53rd football &ndash; lost. Heard that Tom Main (wounded at Barleaux) had died of wounds  - correct. Very sorry to hear of this &ndash; he was one of the very best.  Received letter from pal Doug was simply delighted to get it. Seems ages since his previous one arrived. Issue of a chest comforter.
