<p>Thursday 24 August 1916<br/>A heavy shower or two during the night followed by a sunny, muggy day. About 10 o'clock we left for Gezaincourt, a town very close to Doullens passing on the way a fairly big aerodrome &amp; a barbwire prison for German prisoners. The country traversed was extremely fertile, the undulating fields all carrying good crops of cereals, marigolds, turnips &amp;c.<br/>We reached Gezaincourt about 1 o'clock, finding it much the same type of French village that we are accustomed to. In the afternoon I biked the 3 or 4  kilometres into Doullens, quite a large town outside which is a quaint &amp; interesting old Citadel. One wondered what tales history had to tell about this old relic of former days.</p>
