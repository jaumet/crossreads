<p>Mr. Mapelson returned this afternoon to take charge of the 37 Battalion Transport.<br/>Two big naval guns fired shots from the railway. The guns are marvels of ingenuity. The shells are 12 in &amp; weigh about 50 lbs. With others I went over &amp; had a look at them. They are in charge of English Gunners.</p>
<p>Wednesday June 6. 1917.<br/>It is windy and rather cold this morning.<br/>All night long there was very constant artillery activity in the direction of Ploegsteert, and it is being continued without interruption this morning.<br/>The German reply is very feeble. Yesterday they succeeded in destroying some dumps &amp; batteries, and dropped a boom on an ammunition train at Bailleul, so it was reported here.<br/>No one is to leave the camps to night. There will probably be a stand too. A speedy evacuation by Fritz is expected on this front, at any moment.<br/>The Bombardment has continued throughout the day. Fritz retaliated and burned down a large Factory at Pont de Nieffe. The smoke rose in clouds for a long time. A number of civilians has been killed this past few days, and several families have been shelled out of their homes at Pont de Nieffe &amp; passed here this evening foodless &amp; homeless.<br/>There are innumerable sparrows about here,</p>
