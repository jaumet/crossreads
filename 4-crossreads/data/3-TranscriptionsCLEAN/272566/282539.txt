 At various stages today the weather has been wet, snowy, & fine alternately.  Last night the Australians took another village.  All through the night and throughout today the heavy guns have been booming up the line a bit.  According to Div. Hd. Quarters America has declared war on Germany.  When we went to Beaulencourt today for rations we were informed that the 8th Fld. Amb. are to be relieved tomorrow morning and tomorrow night will be spent at Bernafay Wood.  Pioneers are in this village (Bancourt) now getting timber from the ruins to make dug-outs in the front line.  They are also pushing on with the light railway.  All day Fritz has been dropping "heavies" into Bapaume.  About 100 German prisoners were taken last Monday.
