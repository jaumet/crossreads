  
 October 1918. Monday 14 
 Ahead of Busigny. Bty Position. Weather wet and very chilly all day. Played cards and then laid a mile line to O.P. Went across to village near by and procured some fine vegetables, beans, turnips, carrots, potatoes and cabbage. Had an excellent tea, the above vegs and roast beef. Word came through that the Hun had evacuated, no truth in the rumor. Received some fine letters from cousins and Aunt Isa. Feeling fairly tired. Had a few shells across.
