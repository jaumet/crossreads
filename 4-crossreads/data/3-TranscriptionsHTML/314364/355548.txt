<p>Friday, Feb.14<br/>The weather continues fine &amp; is getting warmer every day. Flu' is still in the air &amp; a number of patients in Hosp. have high Temps.<br/>Sat. Feb.15.<br/>A week of our Homeward Trip has gone &amp; we are not doing bad at all.<br/>The ship is quite steady now, &amp; we can walk the decks in comfort. I wrote a couple of letters, one to Sam Ibbs &amp; one to France, but its not much use writing Home as I should be there as soon as the letters.</p>
