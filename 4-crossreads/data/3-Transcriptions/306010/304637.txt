Emerging from the Vall&eacute;e we arrived at the quiet little hamlet of Wimille where , while partaking of some light refreshment in an "estaminet" I had to listen to a long recital from a little hunchbacked girl who worked all day &amp; every day in the "octroi" (village-customs house) &ndash; she had three brothers in the French army, one of whom was killed at Verdun; he had fought in Tunis &amp; Morocco as well and she showed us his 4 medals. We then retraced our steps through the Vall&eacute;e du Donaire to Boulonge, had a glance inside the fine Cathedral of Notre Dame and walked back to Wimereux via the wide beach with its bathing boxes &amp; coloured tents. Further along the coast at Wimereux</p>
