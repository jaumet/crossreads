Gorgeous flower gardens, and surrounded by huge parks.  One can imagine the sport obtainable in a place like this.  Boar hunting is a recognises [recognised?] pastime.
While here a new boss arrives, and at once becomes a general favorite.  It would not be possible to find two men so different in every way.
This man was a gentleman and he and I became as friendly as it was possible for a Staff Major and a Lance Corporal to be.
I have to thank him for many good times in France and Belgium.
His wife was for some time in Paris and she spent much time with me on my first visit there -showing me round -.  Like her husband she was a real good sort - no swank or humbug -.
We move on from here by lorries to a place where we understand we are to remain for two or three months, as it apparently is at last recognised by the authorities that the Division needs a long rest.
We remain for one night at a small village, and arrive the following afternoon at
GAMACHES.
Here we are quite away from all idea of war.  Everything seems absolutely peaceful and quiet, we are fixed up in comfortable and clean billets, and we all settle down to have a good time and try and forget the war for a time at least.  Everyone is happy knowing that we are really out for a long rest.
A very nice town where one can procure almost everything.  Shops and stores, good and clean.  People of a very different class from those we have met with before.  It is the first time that Australians have been billetted here, and the populance welcome us and treat us well, and their hospitality is not abused.
There is not much work to do.  The troops are given more latitude, and so long as they do not overstep the mark, no action is taken against them.  Entertainments are provided and taking all things into consideration we have a jolly good time.
