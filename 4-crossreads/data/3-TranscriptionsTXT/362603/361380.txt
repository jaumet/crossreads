 Bulford 18-2-17 Dear Mum, I have 3 of your letters to answer   &amp;   I am going to answer them.  Nothing ever happens here so I can give no news but I will get something out of your letters to answer.  First the Billies   &amp;   comforts have arrived at last.  The cake was a bonzer   &amp;   is as fresh as the day it was made.  Other cakes have been dry   &amp;   crumbly but this one is Just lovely.  I have finished the contents of my Billy.  I have plenty of hanky's now   &amp;   this last lot of yours are just great, nice   &amp;   strong.  Soft linen soon goes with rough wear.  We gave the other hankies out.

Never in my life before have I gone over 10 st 3 lb.  I am never lazy either.  I am running about all day   &amp;   often go 7 or 8 mile walks.  Only last night I set out for a 20 minute walk, just to get away from the place.  I ended up in Amesbury 3 miles   &amp;   a half away.  I did not have dinner just for a change so I was feeling nice   &amp;   hungry as the time was 4.30, so I went into a shop   &amp;   had a good feed of Bacon   &amp;   eggs.  I had only walked 50 yds through the Village   &amp;   I met two of the Boys from the Hospital   &amp;   they had not dined, so I immediately went in   &amp;   had another meal.  A chap's stomach becomes very elastic in the Military.  In Civi. life I could not had dinner at Home   &amp;   then
