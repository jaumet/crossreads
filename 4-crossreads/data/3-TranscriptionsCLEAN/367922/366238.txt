 Though I am not quite sure whether you are the father to whom  what  this news will be of some value I am writing to you as the only "Fry" of Lindfield, mentioned in the directory. If it does not apply to you, I trust you will be able to pass the information along. 
 The letter which I enclose was recently received from France & the post-script contains the information to which I refer.
