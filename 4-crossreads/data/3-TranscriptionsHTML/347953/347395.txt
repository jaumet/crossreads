<p>Anzac Beach</p>
<p>The name of Anzac will bequeath an heritage of honour to be handed down to future generations of the Australian &amp; New Zealand people.  Innumerable deeds of bravery, of heroic sacrifice &amp; of mutual friendships some of which are  [indecipherable], forgotten, were committed there on the memorable 25th April 1915.   The beach is narrow &amp; at 60 feet from the waters edge, hills of a very steep incline rise to a considerable height, covered in thick gorse &amp; brambles giving it a very rugged appearance.  During the early days all the necessaires of warfare were packed up on the beach &amp; hillside, - all equipment, supply food stores, guns, wood, and ambulance</p>
