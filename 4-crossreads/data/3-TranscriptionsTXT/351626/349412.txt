 Block E Ward 1 St Andrews Hospital Malta 28/6/1915 Dear Papa You will have heard from a previous letter I expect that we have been fighting on the Gallipoli Peninsula  &amp; that the reason I am here is that a piece of a burning shrapnel shell tore the calf of my leg a bit &ndash; it is only a flesh wound   &amp; is getting on alright though owing to the ragged nature of such missiles may take a good while before I can get back to my Regiment.  I am comfortable here but it is monotonous in bed.  The People in Mata are very good   &amp; I am never short of tobacco   &amp; cigarettes etc.  While on the Peninsula I witnessed the sinking of H.M.S. Triumph by a German submarine it was a rather impressive sight &ndash; she was assisting us by throwing shells over our head onto the Turks position when it happened.  By the way will you get a "Tatts" ticket out of my money about once a fortnight   &amp; of course my insurance premiums as they come due.  How is business progressing   &amp; the property etc. I heard the back paddock had been sold a long time ago.  I have missed all my last letters owing to dodging about to different places but expect to get them later on.  Well goodbye for the present.
