<p>some place. Of course we are not told whither we are going and if we were I could not tell you.  Still we all have a pretty good idea and I don't think I am far wrong when I say that I will probably be able to visit some of father's people when we arrive at our destination.<br/>I have sent some cards and letters at each port of call and trust you have received them safely.<br/>I am in perfect health and have not had a day's illness since leaving Sydney.<br/>We encountered a lot of whalers after leaving port yesterday but did not sight any whales.<br/>I would like to write to the Sharpes but have not their address. I searched through all my books but cannot find it.<br/>As letters must be in by to-night I must now close with best love to all.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Eugene.</p>
