<p>There is no sign of a trench left in it &ndash; the entrances of the dug-outs may be found here and there, like rat-holes, about half-a-dozen of them, being dishevelled heaps of rubbish.  They open into craters now &ndash; no doubt each opening has been scratched clear of debris a dozen times.  You have to get into some of them by crawling on hands and knees.</p>
<p>The first charge took the Western Australians far beyond the farm.  They reached a position 200 yards further, and started to dig in there.  Within an hour or two they had a fairly good trench out amongst the craters, well in front of the farm.  The farm behind them ought to be solidly ours with such a line in front of it.  A separate body of men, some of them Tasmanians, came like a whirlwind on their heels into the farm. Part of the garrison which was lying out in front in a rough line of shell craters found them on top of the craters before they knew that there were British troops anywhere about.  They were captured and sent back.  The Australians tumbled over the debris into the farm itself.</p>
<p>The fight that raged for two days on this ridge was not one of those in which the enemy put up his hands as soon as our men came on top of him.  Far up, on the top of the hills to the right, and in the maze of trenches between, and in the dug-outs of the farm on the left, he was fighting stiffly over the whole front.  In the dim light, as the party which was to take the farm rushed into it, a machine gun was barking at them from somewhere inside that rubbish yard itself.  They could hear the bark obviously very close to them, but it was impossible to say where it came from &ndash; whether 30 yards away or 50.  They knew it must be firing from behind one of the heaps of rubbish, where the entrances of the dup-outs probably were, firing obliquely and to its rear at the men who rushed past it.  They chose the heap which seemed most probable, and fired six rifle grenades all at once into it.  There was a clatter and dust.  The machine gun went out like a candle.  Later they found it lying smashed at the mouth of a shaft there.</p>
<p>The Germans fought them from their rat-holes.  When a man peered down the dark staircase shaft he sometimes received a shot from below, sometimes a rifle grenade fired through a hole in a sand-bag barricade which the Germans had made at the bottom of the stairs.  Occasionally a face would be seen peering up from below, for they refused to come out, and our men would fling down a bomb or fire a couple of shots.  But those on the top of the stair always have the advantage.  The Germans were bombed and shot out of entrance after entrance, and at last came up through the only exit left to them.  Finding Australians swarming through the place, they surrendered, and the whole garrison of Mouquet Farm was accounted for.  Those who were not lying dead in the craters and dust-heap were prisoners.  Mouquet Farm was ours, and a line of Australian infantry was entrenching itself far out ahead of it.</p>
<p>On the ridge the charge had further to go.  It swarmed over one German trench, and on to a more distant one.  The Germans fought them from their trench.  The rush was a long one, and the German had time to find his feet after the bombardment.  But the men he was standing up to were the offshoot of a famous Queensland regiment, and though the German guardsman showed more fight than any Germans we have met, they had no match for the fire of these boys.  The trench is said to have been crowded with the German dead and wounded.  On the left the German tried at once to bomb his way back into the trench he had lost, and for a time he made some headway.  Part of the line was driven out of the trench into the craters on our side of it.  But before the bombing party had gone far the Queenslanders were into the trench again with bomb and bayonet, and it was not long before the trench as solidly ours.</p>
<p>The Queenslanders who reach this trench and took it found themselves looking out over a wide expanse of country.  Miles in front of them, and far away to their flank, there stretched a virgin land.  They were upon the crest of the</p>
