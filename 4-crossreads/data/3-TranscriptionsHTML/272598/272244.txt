<p>Saturday 20.10.17<br/>Went up town, surprised to find it such a large town &amp; so busy.  Remarkable the number of perambulators &amp; bicycles on the streets</p>
<p>Sunday 21.10.17<br/>Took advantage of the good weather &amp; again strolled up town.  Caught train &amp; went to Tuffley one of the residential suburbs.</p>
<p>Monday 22.10.17<br/>Took part in whist drive at night given by the Commandant &amp; had a thoroughly enjoyable evening.  Did not know a great deal about the game but finished up with a good score.  Had only once previously played.</p>
