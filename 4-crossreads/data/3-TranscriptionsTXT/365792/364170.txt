Apl 2 appear to have been bombarded but there are lines of trenches scattered here & there. A Taube came over not long since, bombed the village & killed 7 civvys but no soldiers. We are about 60 miles from England & 60 feet from the Railway. As the rattlers rush past the old barn fairly quivers, the vibration being specially noticeable when one is lying down. Bacon on the Menu for brek. The Englishmen in our forces are unstinted in their praise of France, & all agree that although is beautiful this is better, & there is much more of it. Nearly all the buildings are tile roofed, & most of the walls are covered with plaster, although there are a fair number of plain brick buildings & not a few slate roofs. Of iron I've seen not any. Inspected the RC Church yesty. All the seats are turned from the pulpit & a great number of them have the owners name printed on the back. Fairly heavy bombardment proceeding this
