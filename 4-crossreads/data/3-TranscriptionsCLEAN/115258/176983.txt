 My dear father 
 I posted you yesterday an envelope with 7 photos and a paper cutting in it also a Kai ora Coo-ee. The photos are some I got from a Sergt here and the cutting is an account of the Main Patrol which Cpl Edwards wrote to his brother in Sydney. It is a good account but Edie so far has not seen it and I did not see the good of showing it to him because I know he'd be c  terribly wild with his brother for publishing it. In the Kai Ora Cooee you will see "Mussalabeh" mentioned a couple of times - that is the palce I was on for about three weeks when we left our horses behind and were doing infantry work last time we were in the valley. I have tried my hand at journalism this month too, and have written two alleged poems of the "verse or worse description also an article on whirlwinds and I'm going to post them down to the Kai ora. I don expect them to be published but I ought to get a chip in the answer to correspondents column. So look out for next months Cooee. I have kept a copy of what I am sending and will send it home a bit later or perhaps I'll wait till I see what they say about ir first. There has been no more mail in here yet since
