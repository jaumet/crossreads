 H.M.S &quot;Lancaster&quot; stationed at Jamaica, &amp; then transmitted to us by wireless telegram, the message of course, always being in code. 
 Dec. 8 &nbsp; &nbsp; One night a strange light was descried well off the starboard beam &amp; &quot;Newcastle&quot; was at once despatched to investigate. It was found that the light belonged to the British steamer &quot;Trafalgar&quot; bound from Glasgow to Melbourne, via Panama, &amp; she was allowed to proceed. The &quot;Tralfalgar&quot; must have been greatly surprised by &quot;Newcastle&quot;, for the night was very dark, &amp; &quot;Newcastle&quot; approached her with no lights showing, &amp;, creeping up alongside her, at a short distance suddenly brought all her searchlights to bear on the &quot;Trafalgar&quot;. About this period the nights were very starlight, &amp; often rising stars on the horizon were temporarily mistaken for ships&#39; lights. In one case the moon rising behind&nbsp;two small clouds was&nbsp;mistaken for two ships. So realistic was it that every gun was actually trained in readiness- a really practical instance of &quot;shooting the moon&quot;. The days were distinctly hot now,&nbsp;the sun beating down with great fierceness. 
 Dec. 9. &nbsp; &nbsp;The day before we got to our destination we received a communication from the Admiralty that our ships &quot;Invincible&quot; &quot;Inflexible&quot; &quot;Defence&quot; &quot;Carnavon&quot; &amp; &quot;Glasgow&quot; had sunk the German cruisers &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; &quot;Gneisnau&quot; &amp; &quot;Leipzig&quot; off the Falklands Islands on the morning of December 8th; &nbsp;The &quot;Nurnberg&quot; &amp; &quot;Dresden&quot; escaped. Thus our prospective enemy had been snatched out of our hands.&nbsp;
