<p>sleeping quarters may have to be used as a dressing room if the town is shelled much.</p>
<p>On Sunday night, after several hours of shelling the back areas, Fritz suddenly got on to the village. The second shell (a 5.9) landed in our garden at the back, the third in the yard and next door, and the fourth behind the second one. I was in the cellar. While the last two were creating a disturbance, for the Colonel ordered us all below, as there was no work at the moment, nor likely to occur. Very ugly few minutes.</p>
<p>Every night Fritz bombs. The difference from the first night is that he now bombs in an organised way with squadrons instead of cutting &amp; running with single low flying machines.</p>
