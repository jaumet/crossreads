The whole Temple is about 120? across overall.Halfway between the sunrise stone and the outside of the ruins is a large flat stone 20? long and 8? wide and 1? above the ground.  This is called the sacrificial stone. A little distance from the Stonehenge are several large mounds about 20? high with a base of about 25 yds.These are Tubalise  or burying places of the early Romans when Romans Captured Britain.  The dead were piled in heaps and the dirt piled over them.
