<p>4th to 8th July<br/>Under a overhaul. Engin room requirements overhauled. Transport chipping outside &amp; painted &amp; awaiting our turn for the dock. At present a torpedoed transport in dock under repair &amp; 3 other torpedoed ships awaiting plates to come out from Britian. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   was torpedoed twice. The 1st time she managed to come into port &amp; was repaired &amp; was again torpedoed the 2nd time &amp; struck in exactly the same place as she were formally repaired at No. 2 hold. Cotton seed cargo saved her &amp; eased the explosion. They managed to run her into Alexandria harbor  &amp; beach it. During our stay here we saw all the sights of Alexandria. Bathing beaches. Pompey's pillar. Catacombs &amp; several ancient buildings said to be hundreds &amp; some thousands of years old. Everything is very expensive. 100&percnt; dearer than Australia at present.</p>
