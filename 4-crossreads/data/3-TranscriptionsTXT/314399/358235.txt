Tuesday 26 August 1919Reached Durban about 8 am & went in to the stream about 9 am. Tied up alongside another till 3 when we went in to a wharf taking the place of a departing passenger boat for Blighty. Niggers everywhere. The boys threw down pennies then the niggers fought for them. On guard again. Did my first relief at 5 pm. Everything quiet till 6.30 pm when the Adjutant came along & we found two prisoners missing. Some row then. Sent out search parties but they were missing alright. Never found them up to 10 pm.
Wednesday 27 August 19195am. On duty again. No sign of missing prisoners. All sorts of theories. Court of Enquiry at 9 am today about it all. Have warned our sentries to be there for it Came off at 9 am. Had brekker & then into the Court of Enquiry. Gave my evidence. Told everything I knew. It was adjourned till Friday. Went up to a few shops in a rickshaw with Fraser. Came back to lunch. After lunch Shelley & I went up to town. It is a big place but don't like it as much as Adelaide. Did some shopping & then went & saw the All Blacks beat Natal 17 points to 3. Was a good game. Ground was fair. Had turf on it but was of poor quality. Came back to the boat for dinner. More than half the officers did the same. After dinner Forrest, Dalrymple & I went to see a show at the Criterion. It was half picture & half Vaudeville. It was very poor indeed. Had coffee at the Royal hotel & then got a tram & came back to the ship to sleep. The Borda from Aussie came in a midday & is berthed alongside us.
