Tuesday 9th October 1917
Changed trains Engines at MODERN on the border after passing through MONT CENIS Tunnel. This tunnel takes half an hour to go through, & the scenery is very good.
Had breakfast at MONT MELIAN with the Alps all around us - cold but interesting. Changed LIRES into Francs - fortunately the Railway is the same guage & we have not to change our carriages.
