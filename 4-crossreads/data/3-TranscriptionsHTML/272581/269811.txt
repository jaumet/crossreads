<p>February 1916<br/>we went for an all day route march &amp;  passed through the village of Tel-el-Kebir. It is only a small place but some of the most foul air I ever smelt were in that place. There are also some big orchards &amp; orange groves for orange are grown in abundance throughout the whole of Egypt. We marched right to the far side of the village &amp; into the desert the other side &amp; had musketry &amp; I put my foot on the first patch of grass since leaving Sydney. On the 25th we had an artillery formation across the desert for several miles &amp; it was very interesting work, then again on the 28th we went into the desert for musketry. On the 29th we had to strike camp &amp;  get ready to move again &amp;  I was put on baggage guard. before leaving we were issued with 150 rounds of ammunition &amp; from that onwards always carried it. We got into the train at 10.30 am. &amp;  went back towards Suez to a place called Serapeum where we branched off &amp;  went to a siding near the canal. There is some very heavy sand to get through before reaching the canal but now they are making metal roads. There is a punt &amp; also a pontoon bridge across the canal &amp;  it was across this that we had to go. Our camp was about 1&frac12; miles the Arabian side of the canal &amp; was a terrible sandy place. We were issued with a pint of water for 24 hours &amp; sometimes it had to last 36 hours</p>
