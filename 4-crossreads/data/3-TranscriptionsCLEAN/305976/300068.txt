  
 The headgear worn by them showed them off to advantage It is similar to what the Arabs wear. As a matter of fact most of them are Arabs, but we are told that most of their officers are British but wear the Head dress. It is said they take no prisoners. However they look a wild & woolly crowd. How they show up in action I do not know but they have some good work to their credit. They are to take over the Town in a few days & then we are going to do a 7 days Trek to Richon for a spell & HOME in the near future.
