I would love to have a [indecipherable] at the children playing with their hoops in the Park.I am at present sitting in my tent surrounded by a new mosquito net suspended from a hoop attached to the fly of the tent.   I attached a lot of little lead weights to the skirt of the net.    The chair & I must manage to fit in nicely under the net.   I smoke the pipe in peace & write this epistle & outside the flies storm with impotent rage.    Some of the other officers have just spotted me & reckon that I look like a bride.   Fancy the grapes not ripening at the Wurley - they should have cut off a lot of the leavesI like the way you ended your last letter"God keep you from your loving old Mrs."I will be looking forward to a cable from you about the 14th inst. in reply to mine & sincerely hope we will be able to arrange for you all to come to Egypt.  You must make all arrangements for plenty of money to be forwarded on to you - you will find it pretty expensive here.Good bye dear old sweetheart & God bring you to your loving husbandWill.
