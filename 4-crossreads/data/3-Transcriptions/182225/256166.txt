<p>&quot;Forget It&quot;</p>
<p>If you see a tall fellow ahead of a crowd</p>
<p>A leader of men marching fearless &amp; proud</p>
<p>And you know of a tale whose mere telling aloud</p>
<p>Would cause his proud head&nbsp;<sub>^</sub><sup>to</sup>&nbsp;in anguish&nbsp;be bowed</p>
<p>Its a pretty good plan to forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know of a thing that would darken the joy</p>
<p>Of a man or a woman, a girl or a boy</p>
<p>That will wipe out a smile or the least way annoy</p>
<p>A fellow or cause any gladness to cloy</p>
<p>Its a pretty good plan to forget it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest &amp; best way to expand the chest is to have a large heart in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Success don&#39;t konsist&nbsp;in never makin&#39;&nbsp;blunders, but in never making the same one twice.&nbsp;&mdash;</p>
<p>Josh Billings</p>
