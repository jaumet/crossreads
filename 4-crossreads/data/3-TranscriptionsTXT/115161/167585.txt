 We are under shell-fire from Fritz. They fall all round, &quot;feeling&quot; for our batteries and &quot;dumps&quot;. (A &quot;dump&quot; means the place set apart for food supplies, or ammunition, or other materials necessary for the prosecution of the war.

Every morning these straps were &quot;ripped&quot; off and new ones put on. The ripping process was painful, and I wondered why they were not removed gently, without daily tearing open the wounds. Eventually one morning in ripping off the straps, the intervening piece of flesh came out with the straps. I had to give up wearing boots and took instead to wrapping sand bags
