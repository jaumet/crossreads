  
 Shall have to send to Mr Duke for some more money in a day or so, theres one thing it takes a good deal of money to keep me going what with the girls camera's & etc, but it is well spent for I'm having the time of my life. 
 1st June. This morning Rilen & I went to our new home, a bonza motor car called for us & we rode down in style to Harborne Hall Auxiliary Hospital on arrival we were ushered into a beautiful old oaken hall & there our names & particulars were taken & a nurse (V.A.D) showed us to our room which is by a strange coincidence in No 9. Ward. This is the 3rd time I have been in this number in succession first at Etaples then at the Queens & now here this is a most lovely old place & the gardens & lawns around it
