Friday 14 September 1917Last day at home!  Rose 6.30 a.m., went across the line and left "black" box and 3 certificates of nursing at N.S.W. Bank, no receipt given.  Town 10.50 a.m. train & drew all money 120 out of B.T. Ltd. & put in B.T. Ltd. George St., Sydney at fixed deposit (2 years).  Odd money I drew out (s.d.).  Gave mother 20-0-0 gift.  Barracks 2.30, got away 3.30 p.m. & at Farmers 3.45 p.m., all guests waiting but excuse my delay.  Lovely flowers & bright faces and little gifts for me who cannot realize that I am really going away from all these friends of my childhood & nursing days.  When will it be my turn to give them a "return" tea?  Fearful rush round town then home 7.30 p.m.  8 p.m. 4 Fitzies, Jean & 2 girls, Enid, Nell & a happy evening.  Then packing 'till 2 a.m., bed, very tired & sad to leave but glad too.
