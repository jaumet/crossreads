<p>29.9.16<br/>the horse lines &amp; on Head Qrs lines alone we Kept 2 Camels &amp; a horse on a sledge carting the manure away. At 2.30 this afternoon we all commenced work again finished cleaning up the lines, pulled down saddle racks that were a disgrace cleaned up the feed heaps etc &amp; were kept hard at it to have the Camp looking respectable by 4 oclock, (afternoon stables)<br/>The English Army has the name for cleanliness, but they have not been living up to it here &amp; I do not think the horse lines have been cleaned up once since the camp was pitched, even when we were out on stunts</p>
