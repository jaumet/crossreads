  
 Continual shelling & they do "splash" in the bricks & roads but we are well in our cellars when we hear them coming. 
 Fri. Sept. 1st 1916. Battalion came by train tonight & "D" Company were just over 80 strong after we received about 30 refts & details along I wonder where all our new reinforcements are. Some "Furphy" about us having our last go in here & going to India for Winter. 
 Wed. Sept. 6th Left our cellars at 9 o'clock tonight & took over line in salient from 2nd Bn. We are somewhere near Mount Sorrel. Captain Pugh & Signaller West were up here yesterday on advance & were killed. We are about 4 miles from Ypres & 2 miles to the left of Zeeburghe & the lake Hill 60 is about a mile on our right, front & we were on fatigue up there every night before we left Ypres to come here. Weather is wet & we are up to our knees in mud. No protection from rain & nowhere to sleep if we do get a chance of a daytime. 
 Thurs. Sept. 7th. Weather has cleared up a bit but it would take weeks to dry trenches as they are like
