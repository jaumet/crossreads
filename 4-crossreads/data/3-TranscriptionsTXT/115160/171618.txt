as it is very much cooler in Egypt & Jim for you, you will be dreading the winter coming on & you will feeling it awful, never being used to the cold weather here I will knit you cuffs & mits for your hands same as I did for John when he was in this country also a helmet for your head of course you wont need them till October but I will make a start now. Well Jim I will have to quit for this time hoping to hear from you soon again.  How were your people when you heard from them, well I hope.  Remember me to Bess when you write best wishes from all at 89 Campbell St.
Your sincere Friend
Ann Spence
