 I have been sending week end cables to you each week end for the past month &amp; have advised you in my letters of their despatch but I have not yet heard whether you have received any of them, I will send one to-morrow Saturday 10th inst. but will not send them after that &ndash; there is not much fun sending them if you don't receive them.   Of course if I hear from you that you have been receiving them I will continue sending them.   I also suggested in a previous letter that you should send me one each week end "Major Read Mena House Cairo" would find me.   I have sent by same mail as this a registered parcel addressed "C/o Bank".   You will find in it a dozen brass finger bowls  I thought they would be nice for dessert (they cost 6/- per dozen); of course there are others very much more expensive, but I liked the cheaper ones just as much as them.   If you don't like them or if you think they would be too much trouble keeping clean give them to someone else.   The next treasure you will notice is a real genuine antique from one of the tombs at least so says Mr Abdul the gentleman who presented it to me.  Abdul is a sheikh of Mena village &amp; is a great pot in his own community.    He is the man who used to run our mess &amp; he is the proprietor of the native laundry at the back of our lines.   He is a great friend of mine &amp; would do any thing for me.
