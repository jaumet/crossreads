<p>We had a blanket inspection this morning and we are to be issued with another blanket each, this will make 4 and a ground sheet now.<br/>2 of the 3 I have now are double ones so I am alright.<br/>Last night I wore my thin pyjamas thinking I would keep those warm ones for the winter but it did turn cold, nearly a frost, and I had to get up and put on warmer things.  So I think I will wear the warm ones and trust to luck later on.<br/>This is a lovely camp, the more I am here the more I like it, so fresh and clean after Liverpool.<br/>The stars are shining when we revaillie goes at 5.30 and my word it is cold then, we fall in at 6 o clock and double about a mile down to the river.<br/>The water looks terribly cold as we are there before sunrise but you get so warm running that you don't feel it, and it is nice clean water and very deep and it does give you an appitite for breakfast.  The tucker here is even better than before, though it is stew of course, and now we are in A Squadron we are treated like gentlemen and th our officers come in for a swim with us and are coming to the theatre party with us etc.</p>
