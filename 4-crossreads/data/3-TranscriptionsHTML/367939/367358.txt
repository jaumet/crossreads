<p>Dear Ted</p>
<p>Just a line hoping to find you all well leaving me getting better I think I will be getting up in a few days but it it will be a long time before I will be able to go back to the front. I sent you a Christmas card a week ago   &amp;  suppose you would get it</p>
<p>Well Ted old boy would like to be over there for Christmas I have had five weeks in bed now I am pretty thin I think, I will ring off with best wishes   &amp;  love to you Grace   &amp;  Mavis from you Loving Brother CB</p>
<p>I have no mail from the front yet</p>
