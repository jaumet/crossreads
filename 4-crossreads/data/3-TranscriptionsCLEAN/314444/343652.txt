  
 You should get more than a letter a week as I have written pretty frequent up to date. I hope you recieved that dress material. So far I have not recieved the socks, The hills are so steep that I think they leave all parcels at head quarters  until we come back to base which is every now & then. I am glad Darcey beat McGoorly. How is young Bill. Give him my kind regards & tell him I could do a dinner at Adams. I suppose you are all busy trying to find the winner of the Cups. I have not seen Dan Wells since I arrived I heard young Walford was on his way back to Sydney through a nervous break down. Give my kind regards to all & tell them I am well. With love to all at home, & hoping you are all well your loving Son Tom H. Hill
