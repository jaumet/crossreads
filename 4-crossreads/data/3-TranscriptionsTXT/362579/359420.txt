Pleased she liked the present.
How awfully sad about Miss Cameron's death. Poor Mrs Trangmar   &  Ada will find it very lonely. Am writing a few lines to Mrs Trangmar by this mail.
My special pal (man) wrote such a sad letter this week telling me of his brother's death - was killed in action. The dreadful thing is that he got him transfered.
