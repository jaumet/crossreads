  
 Fri 17th Aug. (cont.) When the hullabaloo on deck had quietened a little, "Little Willie" and and escort bravely ventured down amongst us (flourishing revolvers) and marshalled each ship's crew in turn up under the poop-deck. 
 Ober-Leutnant Rose was supporting himself against a bulkhead quite drunk, giggling foolishly and waving a revolver at us. 
 There were some funny little incidents - Capt. Wickman ("Jumna") thought that deliverance or mutiny was at hand and appeared in a gorgeous, much-creased uniform with about five rings and a curl which had not hitherto seen the light since his capture. 
 He intended to either save or die in his glittering gold braid. 
 A favourable pastime on board is stealing food from the captured ship's stores as it comes on board.
