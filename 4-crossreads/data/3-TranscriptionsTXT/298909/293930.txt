Very hot all day - Went for a route march - across the desert a bit.
Went into Cairo at night & met two fellows from Enoggera - fly flats - they were going to show us Cairo, which they did with a vengeance, we finished up lost in a blind alley & in a very poor delapidated quarter. All soldiers have to be out of Cairo by 9-15 pm - this made us late - so much so that we had to take tram out to Helliopolis & walk across the sand - got home by 10 pm.
17/3.16 Friday
Very hot a dust storm all day - sand blowing about freely - very hard on the eyes. Never gave St Patricks day a thought - Have a very sore heel I strained a tendon a week ago at the Pyramids - comes against me marching
