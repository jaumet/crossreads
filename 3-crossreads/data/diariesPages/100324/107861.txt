5/9/15 Rest Gully
about 2 feet high. The whole place has been cut into terraces on which we have stored our men. They are all on one side ? that nearest the enemy. 
10am. 
Went through the trenches at Quinn's Post for first time with my old friend Capt Percy Comyns 6Bn QM. Entrance overlooks Agean Sea with sea and land at feet for miles round. Shrapnel bursting on hills occupied to our north by Kitcheners Army. At feet a camp of territorials. On right the whole line of Anzac trenches. Went in with Field Artillery officer. Saw whole position through telescope impossible to describe but simply one matted mass of earthworks and incessant crack and burst of shrapnel cordite and bombs. Stench of dead very bad. Men officers killed long ago lying unburied and just undergoing disintegration. Put our pioneers on to dig latrines but unhappily at 3 feet they dug up some English tommy corpses
