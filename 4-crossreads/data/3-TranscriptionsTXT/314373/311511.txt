The monkey cage attracted a great crowd and some of their antics were very laughable, for they seemed almost absurdly human, and we even saw one mother run up to the little one, catch him by the ear and pull him along to her corner, where the little fellow looking quite guilty and crestfallen received a lecture and a parting smack before he made a rather slippery escape. There were some fine specimens of girraffs and as they walked about with their little heads on their long great necks poked over the high railings looking at us almost as if we were the exhibits and not themselves.
