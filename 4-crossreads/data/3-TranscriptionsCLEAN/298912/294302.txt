 21/1/16 Eric marks today by having his hair off properly & looks quite nice. Hop then follows sui & looks decent too.

 Fire drill takes place at 4pm & is heralded by a furious clanging on the big bell, with bugles blowing all sorts of weird tunes. Everybody rushes about laughing & passing such remarks as  "Hey, Bill get your pay book".. Fat Wild runs amok loses his lid & nearly shoves Eric & I over the side. We three were hiding under the shadow of the spuds & enjoying the cool breeze. Anyhow we scrambled down below, donned a lifebelt & sat down waiting for the fire to be put out.
