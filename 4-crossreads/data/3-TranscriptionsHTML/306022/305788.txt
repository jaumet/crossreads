<p>London passed through some very slummy districts such as Clapham. Haze and smoke over everything, and dirt and grubbiness everywhere. Large gasometers all along the line.</p>
<p>Saw the Houses of Parliament and Westminster Abbey just before entering Waterloo Stn.</p>
<p>In London at last and I don't think it will be so interesting after all as I seem to know too much about it already from reading of it and seeing the pictures Anyhow I expect to have a fair holiday while</p>
