  
 Wednesday 11 April 1917 
 Reconnaissance yesterday evening. I went 5 miles past the Outpost line & got shelled by enemy. Water very scarce saw plenty of Turks1 & their line of Tranches was plainly seen. Fun on sand, beautiful green feed but no natural water. 
 I rode 40 miles - & took a lot of Bearings by Compass. 
 Enemy plane flew low over us & fired his machine gun. No fountain pen ink so try & forgive pencil. 
  Found letters on my return - MAY 4/4/17, LAURA 20/4/17, FERRAR 20/4/17, DOLLY 20/4/17. Alls well.
