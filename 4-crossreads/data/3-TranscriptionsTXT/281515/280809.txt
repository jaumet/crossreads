 when daylight came, right opposite where the shell burst was a shell hole &amp; a man was lying in it.  I went &amp; had a look at him &amp; it was one of my own company, stone dead    I found out afterwards that he had been having a sleep further up the trench &amp; when the Huns started to open out he said he would move to safer quarters &amp; he must have been passing just at the moment when the shell got the other two men. 
 We got a Priest at 9 am &amp; buried him further up the valleys where a lot of Australians had been buried.  Corporal Charles Dent was his name &amp; the night before he had been showing me the Photos of his wife &amp; daughter, so when I went to collect my things close to where the shell had burst I was dumbfounded to find my waterproof sheet, riddled with holes &amp; a piece of shrapnel right through my Haversack into a tin of bully beef &amp; through the other side spoon &amp; fork broke into &amp; all my biscuits broken up. so you can imagine  what a narrow escape I had as I would have been lying there if the Corporal had not been going on duty &amp; offered me his place in the dug-out. 
 We went back by easy stages to Warloy again &amp; we were put in billets &amp; fitted out again also got more reinforcements which we need badly after such a lot of men gone west &amp; wounded.  Our turn came round again to go into the line again &amp; this time we went into the trenches in the supports, where we did fatigue work, also small parties were sent up to clear away where the trenches had been blown
