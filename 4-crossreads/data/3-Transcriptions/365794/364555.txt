<p>Sunday 2nd June 1917 [1918]<br/>2nd day of duty &amp; feel less shakey &amp; tired.  Mary ward again.  Church 11 a.m.  Wrote letters Nell &amp; Ida, on pass 5-8.  Ward is less military than last one but jogs on comfortably &amp; pts. are less worried by rules.  On top floor we overlook through back windows the 31st G.H., formerly 14th A.G.H.<br/>Am still saying, "better thank you" to the staff &amp; as I pass Dr. McCulloch, although he is talking to someone, he says "delighted" which I know is meant for me, funny men these English.<br/>A memo in passing &ndash;<br/>A submarine is reported captured ater [after ?] boat was torpedoed Sunday last and in the Capt's pocket was found a receipt of a dinner at Continental the previous day.  Thus do we live among spies &amp; how I wonder does a man like that feel when looking at the poor boys to be torpedoed?</p>
