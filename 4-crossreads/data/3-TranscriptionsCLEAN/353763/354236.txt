  
 Well there's enough of that  -  It's life, the life of the average man & one must take men as one finds them  - 
 The Encounter heads our convoy & John Glossop is the Captain (John Lewin really) John rages very much against us because we are the lame duck of the squadron  -  He constantly signals us wanting us to do a bit more but all we can say is 'that the boss is doing his best' Why a rotten old boat like this was selected for valuable stores is a mystery - she'd be caught & sunk under 5 minutes by any enterprising cruiser  -  It's her last trip so far as we are concerned anyway for from the Captain to the cook not one of us wd  sail in her again  -  Seven weeks out this evng my  dear & so far all well -
