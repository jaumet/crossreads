<p>experience it had been whilst living amidst the land of sand &amp; filth. It is indeed a land of "Mystery". Menu for meals on Sunday 18th inst. Breakfast. About 4 tablespoons of porridge containing hard lumps like suet but with no milk or sugar. Thick black coffee also without milk. A piece of bread about as big as a cricket ball &amp; butter as much as would cover a florin. Of course art mid-day most of the fellows were just about famished. Dinner. A couple of potatoes (in their jackets) &amp; a piece of meat about 4 in. square. &frac14; cup of soup, the latter was very good, but not nearly enough. Of course no bread or tea issued for this meal. Tea. Bread, a piece of butter about the same amount as issued for breakfast, &amp; a dessertspoonful of jam. The three meals put together would just about make a decent meal. Saw some of the Officers tucker being cooked, <u>roast chicken etc.</u>   Every man has been issued with a life belt, these must be worn or must be always at hand, any one found without one will be severely crimed. The sun-set this evening was very beautiful. Bob &amp; I stood on the bow &amp; gazed at the beautiful sight, the splendour of it cannot be described in words. The glorious sea breeze was delightful after the heat that all had experienced last 6 months.</p>
<p>Monday 19th June.<br/>6 a.m.  Bob Roberts, Esbert Smith &amp; I are all sitting in the bow enjoying the beautiful sea air, ship just beginning to roll. All feel very hungry &amp; another two hours to wait for breakfast. An impressive Church parade was conducted by our friend Captain Ward on the Aft Deck. He &amp; I seem to be following each other about. I intend taking him down to our cosy bed rooms where sun never penetrates &amp; very little fresh air is found, it will be an eye opener for him.</p>
<p>Land sighted, turned out to be the Island of Crete (can be easily found on the map).</p>
