<p>15-7-16<br/>&amp; won all the way, Mercer had a good name in the 2nd as he has won a good many fights through knock-outs but I outboxed him from the start &amp; he could not get a decent punch home.<br/>Representatives of the 1st won 3 fights out of 4, so they did not do too bad, all the contests were fast &amp; boxing clean;  The only knock-out of the night was scored by Mannion of the 3rd he met one of the 2nd LH men &amp; knocked him out in the 2nd round<br/>he professes to be the Welterweight Champion of Tasmania;  Cunes of this Regt. will meet him next Monday night &amp; I shall meet the winner in the final.  Cunes also has a good name here, being runner-up in the Amateur Championship of N.S.W. &amp;says he is confident he can account for Mannion</p>
