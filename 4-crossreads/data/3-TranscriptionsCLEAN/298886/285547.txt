That means I must get up at 3.AM. to wake those men of mine some of them are "pearls beyond price" at the gentle art of getting up. at no matter what time one cant find his Socks another has mislaid his boots another his pants & so ad infinitum. They will persist in tiddly- winking with bootlaces and tucking in the ends of straps and messing about generally with such finicky things instead of "a-woppin of em on lively" and getting out. Never mind they'll learn I tell them, that the Turks will bayonet them in their pyjamas and night-caps some of those nights if they don't get a "wriggle on"
