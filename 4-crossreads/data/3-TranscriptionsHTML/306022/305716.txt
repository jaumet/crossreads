<p>Saturday 14th<br/>A bit warmer, though still cloudy. Sports continued in afternoon. As it was boxing &amp; wrestling the parson came around and ordered all the men off the good places on the booms and horse boxes, which though against the rules was allowed on this occasion. I can still feel his look boring me through, which he gave me when I told him so. We are all rather chary of posting letters now, for him to read.</p>
