c/o Australian Offices London 17/11/15Dear Mother,I got 29 letters in a bunch at the office about 5 from everyone.  Have got an extension of Furlough for a week.  I had plenty of money   & went to stay a few days with Aunt Bell   & Marny who were very good to me   & Aunt Bell would give me 5 pounds when I was leaving.  As you know by last letter I am on Home Service   & may go back to Australia for a while.  Am quite alright but a bit weak in the leg after a days walking.  Had a splendid week at Killarney Lakes   & also at Giants Causeway near Port Rush.  Heard Miss Hamilton Mays friend had come over to Guy's Hospital  but when I called the other day she had not yet arrived there.  I have written fairly often   & was sorry to see you were apparently rather worried about me
