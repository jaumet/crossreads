<p>Saturday, 2 January, 1915<br/>Our hospital staff has been very busy lately.  Every day six patients have gone into the main hospital at the Citadel.  Mostly the cases are of double pneumonia and sending them away from us means that they are going away to die.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of accidents through horse falls etc lately I picked up one yesterday that had been rolled on.</p>
<p>We had a fine medical officer named Dr Fiaschi of Sydney, he is a capt of A. sect. of L.H.F.A.  We now have a N. Z. dentist Lieut. Logan in our camp.</p>
