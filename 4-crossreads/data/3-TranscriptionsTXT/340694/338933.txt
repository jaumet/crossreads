48Hack turned up later & I had tea with them & stayed there all next day & next night the reason was our stuff going astray. Came by Motor Lorry & turned up intact.
We are in very good quarters here, built by the Engineers of weatherboard. My friend & I have a nice bedroom with two home made beds so we are "home & dried". Mitch is still cooking for us & is a dag. I was greeted with a huge mail the first day also numerous papers.
We are situated a few miles this side of Ypres near Poperinge. Had occasion to go into Steenvoorde yesterday in the car it was great.
12/9/16.Received more papers to-day.
