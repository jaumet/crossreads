  
 21.3.15 Sunday 21st.  It has been a lovely day & we had a very fair attendance at Church this morning.  We were putting the afternoon in folding overcoats, & strapping them to the saddles & getting everything ready for inspection to-morrow.  We are to be inspected at Zietwoun.  Idleboy's leg is still bad as the result of the kick he received last Monday.  Took my new tunic to one of the shops this afternoon to have the sleeves cut down to the right length, went nowhere after tea, & put the evening in, writing.  Pitt return ed from hospital.
