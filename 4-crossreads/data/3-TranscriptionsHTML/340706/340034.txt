<p>80<br/>have been honeycombed to <strike>give</strike> make a house in the rock the only sign that a house exists is the barred windows. These chalks often come away in large land sides so should not like living under them though in some cases the village is built under them</p>
<p>Further along the river opens out into a wide pastoral &amp; agricultural country running up to forest clad hills. On a dominating part of the ridge looms up the ruins of the castle of [Robert le Deafer] who in &amp; about 1070 prodeused all the [indecipherable] &amp; cruelty of hell here. The ruins which I did not visit on this trip seems to have been restored.</p>
<p>The villages passed include Croisset, Val de Haye? sahens, &amp; La Boulle a pretty little village nestling beneath perpendicular chalk cliffs. The church has a landing place for [indecipherable] almost at its door &amp; half the town is separated from riverbank by a narrow street only. In the other parts the streets are so narrow that it would be absolutely impossible for 2 carts to pass &amp; if one cart is in the street the other must back to the next cross street.</p>
<p>The spot is very pretty &amp; I will certainly make another trip there. The day was not suitable and was very cold &amp; we were nearly frozen by the time we arrived back. The journey took 1 &frac12; hrs down &amp; 2 hours back.</p>
<p>On arrival in town we went to Club &amp; dined &amp; then</p>
