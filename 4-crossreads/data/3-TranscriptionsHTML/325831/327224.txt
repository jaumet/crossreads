<p>My dear Judge</p>
<p>It was very kind indeed of you to write me your letter of 2 November which has just reached me. As perhaps you know I got a chip of shell into my skin the day before you wrote &amp; instead of healing quickly it has taken a long time, in bed, to get right as a tendon was cut &amp; got septic. It will be about 3 weeks before I can go back as I have not been about long &amp; it has still to finish healing. It was bad luck having to come away just then as meantime my old battery has been broken up in reorganising into 6gun</p>
