<p>FRIDAY, JUNE 27, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine but very bleak &amp; cold. Peter</p>
<p>rode in on his bike &amp; fixed up with</p>
<p>Maunders about getting car in.</p>
<p>Edwards fixed up 4D mill.</p>
<p>Tickle drawing sand to the</p>
<p>Boundary troughs. I was round</p>
<p>the Mountain in morning &amp;</p>
<p>started stacking up that block</p>
<p>by black flat in Middle</p>
<p>Paddock.</p>
