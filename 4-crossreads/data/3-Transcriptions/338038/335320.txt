<p>all the time.</p>
<p>All letters have been hung up since I wrote last. Had a wire from Sis asking how I was as she was cabling you and wanted    <strike>me</strike>  to include something about me. We are in very comfortable billets here &ndash; Percy Ross &amp; I rode over to a neighbouring village a couple of nights ago to see Les. His Battalion were billeted there and we found him just coming in after a strenuous game of football. He looks well and as usual is in the best of spirits. His crowd had a camp fire concert in the evening, the entertainment being given by a troupe of pierrots, men of the AIF who are struck off duty</p>
