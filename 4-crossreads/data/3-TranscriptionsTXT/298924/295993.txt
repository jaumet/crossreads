 Saturday 11 January 1919 Rafa Brigadier Gen. Cox inspected us today, he played to the gallery as usual, often at the expense of the officers &ndash; visits to the "Two Up" School etc.  This is of course outre. Very windy &amp; dusty &amp; last night very cold. Went for a hunt with the Rafa Hounds some English Officers have here.  About 15 went out &amp; we ran 2 Foxes &amp; a Jackal.  We are now getting up a Race Meeting for the men, anything to keep them occupied &amp; happy if possible. No news only waiting. With love to you all Your fond son F.W.
