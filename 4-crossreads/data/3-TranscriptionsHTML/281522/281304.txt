<p>28/5/17 Bouzincourt<br/>Monsieur again took une photographie de la petite Chretienne" &ndash; a solemn and serious ceremony. Yesterday and today being F&ecirc;te de Pentecote and WhitSunday there are many preparations in the way of white dresses etc. for the "premiere communion". Met Colonel Watson, Macgregor, &amp; B.M. in the street just over for a look round. As the Engineers etc. still use our parade ground this afternoon I cancelled the parade and put on the Sports finals instead. There was some excellent sport. The boxing resulted in a win for Sailor Parsons in his class and Caffrey lost on a foul to Binns in the heavyweights. Tugs of war also gave some good events and a very merry good afternoon's sport was enjoyed by everyone. Spent the evening talking to Madame at the Regimental Office billet and drank a glass of her extra special pre-war brewed liquer &ndash; made by a select recipe and only produced on a grand occasions.</p>
