<p>11.9.15<br/>Sat 11th<br/>Received another apology for a mail again to-day. I received a letter from Lilian Tomlins also a package of cigarettes; &amp; some papers from Aus. but no letters: Everything is very quiet here &amp; the only thing we have to interest us is the dispatch rider running the gauntlet along the beach &amp; the Turks sniping at him, they have put some shots very close but have not succeeded in hitting him yet, occasionally a man on foot also walks down this road not knowing the danger, but they are soon made aware of it when the shooting starts; Fleas gave me a rough time here for the first few nights, but they have now deserted us or else I am getting too thick in the hide to notice them; It has been cooler to-day than what it generally is.</p>
