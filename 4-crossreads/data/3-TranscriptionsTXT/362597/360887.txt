Issue of tucker, I got up in a corner with a couple of my nurse friends. They covered me up with rugs & the officers & other nurses thought that I was one the Officers. I had one of the most pleasant evenings I have spent on the whole journey.
The chief engineer was one of the party & he invited me down to his cabin. I went down when the girls went to bed at 10 pm & had a chat & he gave me a box of 100 lovely cigarettes. I have 35 packets of cigarettes as well as these. I got them for 2d a packet. They are 5d in Cairo. I have nearly enough to see me out for 12 months.
