<p>the top. By this means the flood waters of the river gradually flooded a large area of country and eventually formed these lakes. These being retained as in a basin by the dam. A spillway with steel gates was also constructed to control the level of the waters and is capable of discharging 154,000 cubic feet of water a second, which is ample to cope with any heavy waters from the river. On one side of the spillway another retaining the flood waters had been constructed also a large electric plant erected. Sufficient electric power is generated to furnish electric force for working and lighting purposes along the whole of the whole canal. The township at the locks is a fairly large one and there was quite a crowd (easily the largest so far) of whites people, American soldiers and also niggers on the walls of the locks we entered to greet us. The band which had been playing off and on the whole day now put forth its best efforts and the whole of the soldiers sang "Anzac" "Australia will be there" and other military songs. We felt quite excited over the event of the day and were just in the right mood for kicking up a row.<br/>There are three pairs of locks in series at Gatun and these lowered the ship approximately 85 ft to the level of the Atlantic Ocean or really Limon Bay. These locks represent a huge successful engineering feat. The whole must be 3&frasl;4 mile in length. We were towed into the first lock as previously explained, then the water was let out until we were on the same level as that in the second one, steel gates between the first and second opened, towed into the second lock, then the same procedure until on the same level as the water in the third lock, steel gates opened between second and third, towed into third lock and lowered again until on the right level through another pair of gates and then into Limon Bay on the sea level once more.
