<p>The country which we can now see is Norfolk, and the scenery is indeed, very pretty.  Low cliffs abut the sea and beyond them, to a range of hills in the rear, beautiful farm country can be seen.  There are bright green meadows &amp; dark green trees in the background and at 6.30 the pretty little seaside resort of Cromer was abeam to enhance the beauty of the scene.  To add to the beauty we are steaming along in perfectly smooth water, about a mile off the shore.  Ahead of us are mainly steams some travelling in the same direction, some coming towards us.  Two or three on each side &amp; many astern following or going opposite &amp; to crown everything the sun shining brightly &amp; warmly.  Many trawlers could be seen</p>
