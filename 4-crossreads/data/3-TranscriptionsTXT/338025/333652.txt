 Wednesday 4th April 1917 Two or three German aeroplanes passed over our camp. Great number of shots fired by anti-aircraft guns. The aeroplanes were not hit, but returned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to their own lines. In the evening two of our balloons (spotters) were brought down by the Germans.
