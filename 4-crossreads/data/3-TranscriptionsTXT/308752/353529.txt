 Most of us had hoped that the year just ended would have seen the war ended, but alas that hope has not been realized. We hope &amp; pray that before the next winter has come round the guns shall have fired their last volley &amp; the din of war shall have given away to an ever lasting peace. 
 On the 7th of January a combined football team picked from the three Ambulances of our Division played against the Engineers. It was a splendid game, the A.M.C., won easily, 7 of our Unit, are in the team, we are some Unit you know. A few days later, the A.M.C. played against the Pioneers, &amp; won easily again. It looks as if our team will win the cup. After the match I went along to S---- to a smoke concert, &amp; very enjoyable it was too. Eric's contributions, as usual were well received. A Literary &amp; Debating Society has been formed in the Unit &amp; many a pleasant night I have spent at these meetings. I think it is a splendid idea,  it certainly occupies our minds &amp; helps to break the monotony of this life. As we have a great number of learned men in our Unit the Society should be a success. I find myself looked forward to these meeting at really this is a most monotonous life. On the 15th inst. a couple of our Sergeants gave us a lecture on Ireland, &amp; the railways of Australia &amp; very interesting subjects there were too.
