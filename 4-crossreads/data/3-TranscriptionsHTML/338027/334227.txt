<p>Wednesday, 18 August, 1915<br/>A terrificly hot day flies were unbeatable there were very few patients brought down during the day the sap is well organized now three ambulances are in it so that when we have our next rush we will be able to cope with it.  We hear unofficially that a large transport the Royal Edward was sunk outside Lemnos, but the accounts are contradictory.  During the day we had visits from General Godley &amp; Ashmead Bartlett the celebrated correspondent.  We are longing for our mail to arrive, their are three due now, one was supposed to have been sunk, snipers are still playing on the gully but are gradually being accounted for.  Our beach guns did great havoc during the night &amp; the Welsh Fusiliers in our gully charged &amp; captured a trench &amp; two saps.  The Turkish dead is appalling.</p>
<p>Thursday, 19 August, 1915<br/>I had to go write back to Anzac &amp; Walker's ridge for Stores &amp; had to lump them the four miles on a stretcher in awful rain, however we brought back an old mail with us so our hearts were lighter though the load heavy I rec nine letters.  Two Taubes came over us to-day &amp; saw our positions so we may expect shelling to-morrow.  During the night the N. Zealanders took a Turkish trench just above us but later on the enemy counter attacked with bombs &amp; drove our men back to their original trench.  Our artillery blew up a whole Turkish trench including a few machine guns it was marvellous shooting.  Patients coming down the sap are well treated now they get two cups of cocoa between the firing line.  A few N. Zealanders were knocked out by shrapnel not far from us.  My Brothers are in Egypt the younger is in hospital with slight typhoid.</p>
