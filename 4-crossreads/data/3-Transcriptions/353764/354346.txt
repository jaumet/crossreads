<p>Last night the Band was playing &amp; I got very sad &amp; lonely as they played "Somewhere a voice is Calling".  My mind immediately went back to the loved ones at home.  We are fighting the A.S.C Championship off with Gloves (that is the men) &amp; I can tell you there are some willing contests.<br/> I will write the winners name on the Date of the final.</p>
<p>Tuesday 30/11/15<br/>Still out at Sea, nothing of much importance happened</p>
<p>Wednesday 1/12/15<br/>The first Day of the month of Christmas &amp; we are still punching on towards Egypt.  We are now practically through the "Trade Winds" which every boat catches to help them on.<br/>Another couple of Days &amp; we will be in the tropics.<br/>The Boxing preliminaries came off to-day &amp; the A.S.C. came out with a win for each Representative.  The finals are to be fought later on.  The food is going from Bad to worse.</p>
<p>Thursday 2/12/15<br/>It is the advent of a miserable time.  I received another Inoculation &amp; consequently am feeing very sick.</p>
