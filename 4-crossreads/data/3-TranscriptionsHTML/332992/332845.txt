<p>Friday 23 March.1917<br/>It was cold last night, in fact freezing, and ice on the water this morning.  The cold continues today, with some cold showers.<br/>The papers report a rapid advance of our troops.  They are within 6 miles of St. Quentin.  The foe's resistance stiffens at Points, but their rearguards are steadily driven from their positions.  There have been successful raids, our progress continues, and another 40 villages have been liberated.  There was considerable artillery activity during the day on both sides in the neighbourhood of Armentieres and Ypres.  The foe continues to burn villages, sack houses, cut down orchards, poison or polute wells, carry off or destroy everything of value.  Before evacuating the huns stripped the villages of all metal, and stripped the gutters &amp; roofs of the cathedrals.<br/>24 British ships ships have been sunk last week, which is more than the previous week.  I have been in doors all day reading and playing draughts.  There was no pleasure in going out.<br/>I think to day is good Friday but am not sure.</p>
