A fuller discription of Constantinople and its people must be left until we meet again.  The evening saw me playing skittles fortunately provided by the Germans at the Hotel which is now the Officers Rest House.  I did remarkably well considering it was my first essay and I put my success down to time wasted at the C.A.C.  After a very fair dinner we went to a Cafe Chantant called Les Petits Champs and a more rotten show I have not before suffered and so home and to bed.

Terrific hustle in getting away, everything seemed to stick.  Canteen purchases dragged out, ordnance was not ready with our stuff purchased, supplies had to be rechecked & little trifles like bread & blankets omitted by some careless genius had to be put right.  A missing stud too delayed me two minutes.  That the loss of this time should upset me may amuse you but I think you realise that when I'm on my official job I'm a perfect pest at pun'tuality and hitting the tin tack correctly.[Drawing](This as a reviver.)
