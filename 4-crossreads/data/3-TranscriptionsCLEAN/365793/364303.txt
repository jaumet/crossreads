PortisheadJly 21 on the bed & gave me a deuce of a fright.Left Wimbledon at 9.30, London at 11; arrived here just before 3, & drove up to Gledhow. Both Aunt & Uncle were surprised to see me. Confoundedly hot today, hottest i've known it here. After tea Uncle & I went for a long walk. Called at a cottage on the way back & had a glass of beautifully clear, cold well water. Solid supper & then turned in an hour before midnight - feeling tired & sleepy
22 Up at 8 (not 6!) Like rain, but fairly warm
