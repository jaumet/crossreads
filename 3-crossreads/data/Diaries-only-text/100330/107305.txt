one Mile up to the Gang Way then a Rope was passed behind the Mule's Hind Legs the Tommies would haul him into the Gang Way up the Mule would go.

We travelled during the night very slow averaging about 15 miles per hour passing Rouen during the Night at about 12 noon we passed through Abbeville, a large Town where a large number of Japanese were building a new Railway also a lot of German prisoners working on an embankment. The Country Scenery en route was beautiful. From what I have seen France has very little unoccupied Land, every available piece was under cultivation of some kind. Abbeville has a very large Locomotive Depot we expected to be detrained there, any how we were dissapointed as after a few Minutes stoppage for Loco Purposes we left again at 12.15 Pm still going slowly we arrived at Etaples
