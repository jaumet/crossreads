1917Thu  11th Oct.An alarm in the morning which turned out to be only practice;  but it sufficed to kill 2nd mate Johnson of the "Beluga".   Heart-failure.   Strange to say there are 13 of us at table (or were before he died.)
Fri 12th Oct.The body was laid on the hatch covered with an American flag and at 9 am he was buried from one of the gun-doors under the starboard gun.   We all dressed for the occasion (it was the first time most of us had had socks on for months).
The show of uniforms was rather dazzling, but most of them were well streaked with mildew and creases.   Capt. Olsen read a short service.   The "Hitachi" was met later in the morning and we patrolled in company.
There is no sign of any vessel so far - we are now in the vicinity of Mauritius.
