  
 By Dukes energy I am placed at [indecipherable] table & Dolleans table & he gives me a rendezvous after 30/6/19. After dinner & the speeches we adjourned to an enormous concert room carpeted in red & hung with pictures several of the largest being naked women & to me show the mark of the nation. 
 In Rue de la Paris there is a tableaux showing France or Victory surrounded by her conquering generals & the figure of the woman has red teats on well formed breast - a fact emblematical of a Frenchmans mind. 
 After dinner walked along Boulevards with Duke & Loepp & then home. 
 19-6-19 Rose about midday - a usual occurrence here & then spent all the afternoon in the beautiful garden de Luxemburg, amid the cool sprays of waters. 
 The people here use chairs for the most part but they turn them towards the most beautiful spots & not inwards on the path as we do. 
 In the night I make the rounds of the students Cafe, La Source being most typical & the girls who frequent it the nicest - being of the [grisette] type & not the pulain. 
 20-6-19 Went to Bank this morning & changed my last money a 10 note into francs
