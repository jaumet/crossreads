We have ample evidence of their complete subjugation by Germans.Everybody had to be in bed and all lights out by a certain hour each evening.If when passing an officer in the street a civilian failed to raise his hat or a woman to curtsey they were fined 25 marks.A tax of 5 marks was imposed on everybody to enable them to live in their own homes.Even now it is a common thing to see hats doffed to officers and girls curtseying. Everybody wears a very subdued expression on their faces but they are coming out of their shells a little as each day goes by.
