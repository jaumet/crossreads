<p>Monday 19 March 1917 [18 March 1918]<br/>Back to the same old round of no work &amp; yet no chance of enjoying the rest as we "bed pat" all day long &amp; the sister in charge is at the same mental strain all through.<br/>Concerts in the wards keep us from being too depressed &amp; to see these long wards full of brave boys all in their blue coats unbleached calico shirts &amp; red ties is very interesting to me &amp; to study their faces a great pleasure.</p>
