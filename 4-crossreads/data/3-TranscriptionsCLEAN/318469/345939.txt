casualties & damage to our trenches.  Just below our camp there is a notice board & while Sap Lalor was reading some orders on it a shell land a few ft from him lifting him about 20 ft & landing him through a blanket roof on a Q.M's Store onto the floor some 8' below.  He was rather badly wounded but it is thought that he will get over it alright.
17thFairly heavy bombardment this afternoon more casualties & damage to our trenches.  Our Artillery is doing good work.
18thAs usual on the Sabbath as much work as usual.  Nothing of interest.
19thA good deal of shelling from Enemy doing some damage to our trenches causing some casualties.  Our Artillery replied I believe with good effect.
20thFairly heavy shelling from Enemy early in morning & again in the afternoon.  Our Artillery was fairly active too & appeared to be getting well into the enemy's trenches.  Usual exchange of rifle fire and bombs.
21stNothing fresh today except that our Artillery put in more than usual.
22ndIt is thought highly probable that the enemy will make an attack tonight & every precaution is being taken to give them a warm reception.  Our Howitzers gave them a particularly warm time today.
23rdThe expected attack did not eventuate last night.  Every preparation had been made to give them a warm reception but beyond that a good deal of firing about 1.30 a.m. nothing occurred but Artillery is busy again today & the enemy has put in a good deal too this afternoon & also fired some very heavy bombs.  One shell 75mm fell amongst our dugouts but luckily did no damage as it did not explode.
