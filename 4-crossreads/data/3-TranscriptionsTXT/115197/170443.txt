 Army &amp; Navy Leave Club

 With my friend I visit Bois-de-Boulonge, a reserve of 2.000 odd acres once used for hunting but now an immense park greatly frequented in summer.&nbsp; It has artificial lakes &amp; cascades and is most popular with horse riding parties. 
 Return to town and thence to Wagram. 
 A cold &amp; rainy night.
