<p>Saturday 29 September</p>
<p>To A.D.M.S. Dickebush<br/>To Anzac Hd. Quarters<br/>To Advanced Dressing Station on the Menin Road through Ypres.  Ypres is a pitiful sight &ndash; smashed to the ground.  It is one of those old fashioned towns surrounded by a wall and ditch, with gateways leading out on to the main roads.  In peace time Ypres must have been a beautiful place, but now it is much more knocked about than Bapaume.  There isnt a building with a roof on it, and there are only a few walls of buildings left.  It reminds one of acres of scattered bricks.  The one time Church is now practically wiped out.</p>
