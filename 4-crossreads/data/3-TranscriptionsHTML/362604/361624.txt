<p>&amp; Peel away in the distance from the Train.  We had a dreadfully rough trip back to Liverpool &amp; I was a little bit sick.  Waves swept the deck &amp; there was only room for 6 on the top deck, &amp; Dave &amp; I &amp; a Yankee Lady made 3 of them.  Ellis went below but I was the only one sick.  I was only bad for 5 minutes, only one heave.  There weren't 10 people on the boat not sick.  We travelled on the old Fenella, a 500 ton packet &amp; she had to have a new boiler put in in 1893, so she is pretty old but not a bad sea boat.  We missed our train our Train at L'pool at the boat took 7&frac12; hours &amp; we had to stay in London over night.</p>
