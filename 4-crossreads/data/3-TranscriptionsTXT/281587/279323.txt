 ruins of Qulast ed Doumm, or Castle of Blood.  These ruins are  very  extremely ancient, and built of a very red stone, from which it is generally supposed it takes its name.  The present ruins were built by the Crusaders, and were spoken of by very early writers, but according to Authorities, they only replaced a much older construction.  From the summit of these ruins a magnificent view can be obtained, taking in the Valley of the Jordan, and the Mount of Temptation, with the Monastry on its heights.
