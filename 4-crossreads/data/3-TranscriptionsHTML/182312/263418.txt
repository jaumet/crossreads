<p>and would speak of you as her favourite sister&quot;.&nbsp; This almost in-</p>
<p>variably pulled a prize but you wanted to make sure in these cases</p>
<p>that the old thing hadn&#39;t been dead a decade or so.&nbsp; I wrote fully</p>
<p>a dozen letters for different chaps, with varying success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we had been in camp about three weeks, we had our first</p>
<p>experience of a Zeppelin.&nbsp; It was Anzac Day and we were awakened</p>
<p>just after midnight by a tremendous explosion which fairly shook the</p>
<p>earth.&nbsp; It didn&#39;t take us long to realise that we were being shelled</p>
<p>from somewhere but whether it was from the Channel or from the air</p>
<p>we could not tell until we got out of our tents when we could hear</p>
<p>aircraft engines and presently caught sight of the Zeppelin away up</p>

<p>through the trunks of trees 12 inches thick and embedded in other</p>
<p>trees further back.&nbsp; The bombs weigh 120 lbs. and are equal in power</p>
<p>to a naval 8 inch shell.&nbsp; They make considerable noise as they come</p>
<p>through the air which is generally enough time to allow you to throw</p>
<p>yourself flat on the ground which is the safest position.&nbsp; Our</p>
<p>crowd didn&#39;t bother about dropping on the ground, but satisfied them-</p>
<p>selves with standing out in front of their tents and cursing the</p>
<p>Zeppelin - cursing as only Australian soldiers can.&nbsp; She passed</p>
<p>clean over the top of my tent but did not drop any bombs on the way.</p>
<p>It was a very dark night and from the height she was she could not</p>
