  
 over all our travels & prospects as I shall probably be leaving for front    & Pal expecting to obtain his commission in England, will unfortunately break up our little party of such a long time. At 11 pm we conduct Pal to the Barrier on his way home & all feeling very satisfied with our grand party so successfully carried through thanks to the able management of our capable hostess, Madame St Armand. A birthday I shall remember, far from home. 
 6th Sept:- Wednesday Don't feel inclined for work, but have to go at it hard all the time. A beautiful day. Pay all expenses of yesterday's party which cost me only 8 francs. See Legge to his tailor's to do the necessary talking & spend the evening indoors writing. 
  7th September:- Thursday
