<p>so short a time &ndash; though I took some consolation to myself and thought perhaps I wasn't such a baby seeing that the raids at Calais had left a mark!  You will be glad to know that when I left St Albans the Medical Officer game me a 1st Class certificate of health, and I was overjoyed to report to Miss Conyers, the next day ready for work.  She really was very nice &ndash; asked me wouldn't I like a trip back to Australia  to see my people and friends and where I could have plenty of good nourishing food then she added "You know Sister you have been off duty 3 months and if you get sick again you'll be sent back for good &ndash; whereas now you could have the trip and come out again &ndash; And see what it has done for me".   Yes, certainly Miss C. looked a new made woman when she came back.  Yet something within whispered &ndash; stick it to it Anne &ndash; And I replied that I felt so well that I had no fear of getting sick again <strike>You</strike> And I would rather not go then.  You know I want ever so much to see you all and Australia too &ndash; but I diddent want to leave Ross.  And this big struggle going on in France I thought might be the end of things And I wanted to be in at the finish &ndash; however I was told then to take a fortnight's leave <strike>then</strike> and report again.  Now I could have gone to friends the whole time but I felt it would be imposing too much with the present difficulty of food and rations.  So I decided to go off on a tour or my own.  Am issued with two concession tickets, no sugar ticket, then I proceed to the Food Controller's office and get a travellers meat and butter ticket.  This was Wendesday and I go to see my friend Stella and baby Geraldine &ndash; who is such a sweet winning little pet but not very well so I stay</p>
