<p>Tuesday 23 January</p>
<p>So cold today that the wheels of the water cart were frozen to the ground and we had to loosen the hard ground with a pick.  Today I have been on a job of digging an old German trench a bit wider so that it can be made into a dugout to accomodate bearers, at the A.D.S.  The sky has been beautifully clear and Fritz aeroplanes ventured over.  Later in the evening heavy shells came over, some killing and wounding 12th Fld. Amb. men a few hundred yards away from us.  Tomorrow we go to the trenches for 7 days.  I was hoping to be off to England on leave but unfortunately will have to wait another week.</p>
