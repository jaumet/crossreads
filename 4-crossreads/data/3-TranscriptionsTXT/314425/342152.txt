We lost our Colonel. He was wounded & when was being helped to a place of safety was killed by a shell. Two of our pack mules were killed but all the drivers escaped safely. Our casualties in men were heavy. All the Battalions suffered & had to get help from the 11 Brigade. The 40. Batl. lost 8 pack mules & the drivers all wounded.Last night the enemy planes bombed all around here & many animals were killed. Our artillery team of 6 mules were killed a few chains from our camp & 1 driver killed & the others wounded. 3 other horses were killed along side of them and 7 drivers in all wounded. One bomb did all the damage. This morning I had a look at them & saw the tail of the bomb. It had the broad arrow on it & English markings. One of our planes flew over at the time & it is possible they were all killed by our own bombs, through the observer making a mistake. In the adjoining wood several horses were killed & men wounded by Tommy artillery a few days ago. There are a lot of mistakes made in this war. An artillery man secured the piece of bomb & was to show it to his own officer with a view to having enquiries made
