<p>Holiday.  I am not surprised to hear of Peter Seymour's Treatment.  You would be astonished to know how much or rather how little some Doctors know.  Success to you L.O.L.  It is rather a thankless job to try &amp; get people to look after their own Interests.  I should be of very little use to Otto as a cutter for about 6 months at least.  As general manager &amp; rouse about I might be of service.  But we are sure to want to set up for ourselves on return but in which line we'll decide when we know how our Cash lies.  I hope young Nat looks us up.  Fairbrother &amp; the rest of the job will have quite a nice time compared with the 1914 &amp; 1915 boys.</p>
