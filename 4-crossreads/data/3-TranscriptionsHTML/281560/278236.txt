<p>7/4/16.<br/>I was a bitter cold night, with wind and rain. Busy settling down into camp routine. The camp commandant was to inspect us but the move fell through.<br/>8/4/16.<br/>The inspection came off today, and he said the usual things when it was over. Then we went through a general medical inspection. An Aeroplane and and two Parseval Airships passed over the camp in company today.<br/>9/4/16.<br/>The Australian units are ordered to be ready to move off to pitch a camp for themselves across the Railway line on the sand dunes. We were issued with a blanket and woollen underclothing against the cold which was very severe last night.</p>
