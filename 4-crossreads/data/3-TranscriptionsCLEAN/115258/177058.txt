  
 well again now and getting up today. I knew when I came here it was  ol  only Jordanitis and if I'd been out at the regt I'd hardly have bothered going to the Dr with it, but when you are at a rest camp and know of "a better role" like the 14th what's the use if you dont go to it? The Xmas mail closes on 1st Nov and I had hoped to write tons of different letters by then; however they wont matter being a little late I suppose so I'll write 'em as soon as I can. Wonder when the wool will be appraised? Am looking forward to seeing us top the market absolutely this year! I know we can do it. Well! I'll write again  in a day or two. With love and A Merry Christmas to all from Rob.
