It is a lovely day on top not too hot for although we are in the Red Sea it is winter time so not too hot.
Have been doing some washing wonder if I can get in before someone shakes it, I do not feel in the mood for writing with this Court Marshal at the end of my trip all I am worrying about is the hope that I can let my friends people know what happened before we get to Melbourne 
Mistake in the date. 19th. Nothing much to report. Only that it is getting hotter daily, there are plenty of porpoises knocking about of a morning
20th Am on guard today but there is very little to do as it is only a rag-time one
Awnings are being erected all over the ship as a protection against the coming hot weather.
