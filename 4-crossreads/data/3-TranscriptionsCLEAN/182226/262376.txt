 Left Gozo for All Saints, I was not in the draft but I went & got put on. 
 We left Gozo at 2 p.m. arrived at Malta at 4.30, put in No 1 Section. 
 Mac had lef[t] All Saints today. I said things. 
 The rules have been made more springent here now but I hope to find a way of getting over the difficulty.
