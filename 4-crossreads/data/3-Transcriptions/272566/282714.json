<p>Tuesday 27 November</p>
<p>Beautiful Day.  Sightseeing again &ndash; Impossible to name all we saw.  Visited the American Club and yarned with the Yanks.  Paid a very amusing visit to the Musee Grevin (wax works) &ndash; a very fine display.<br/>After tea we went to the Olympia &ndash; This, too, was very funny especially the bicycle turn.<br/>Paris is a gay city and in many respects more attractive than London, though the meals are not up to the English standard, the customs being different entirely.  Today I tasted a few snails as a souvenir dish.</p>
