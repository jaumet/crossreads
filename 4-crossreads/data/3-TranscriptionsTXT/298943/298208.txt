leave the last half hour in before going to sleep for the three of us to discuss some problem that has arisen during the day. Generally it deals with Spiritual matters, & there we have established a wonderful harmony --- soothing, comforting & encouraging.Bert, the youngest, is questioning, but relies on us for general information as a rule, but still he is to my mind the best type of Christian of the three of us. He is gentle yet firm with a splendid loyalty to his beliefs.
