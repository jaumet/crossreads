  
 On entering one of these houses we disturbed several Huns who jumped from a window in the first storey taking their machine gun with them & being unable to chase them without exposing our selves we decided to return to the front line which was accomplished without having a shot fired at us. During the last couple of days we were in this position the enemy started to being up his artillery for he shelled our front line on several occasions causing a few casualties; he also shelled the Railway line in rear of us also an old Railway Ordanance workshop, obtaining many direct hits. It was during the early part of the night of the 15th that the 2nd Battalion arrived to relieve us, when we moved back to supports just outside the village of Sec Bois. Whilst in this position our duties were nil except to remain there in case we should be required to Reinforce the front line & the Imperial Troops where occupied this sector during the Huns advance were reorganised & brought in on our right which made things much easier for all hands. We had a good time here for the boys were able to move about being about a mile from the front line, also, living very high for the French people had left the village without taking their live stock with them, consequently fowls, pigs, eggs & vegetables were soon taken in hand by the troops for it was of no use leaving them to the mercy of the enemy shells. By this time many cows were lying about the fields which had been killed by the enemy's shells these having to be buried by the troops where possible. During the night of the 20th the 3rd Brigade moved up to relieve us after which we marched back to Railway Huts at Bourre Siding which were very comfortable quarters. our duties from here consisted of fatigue parties to the forward area on trench digging & barb wiring it not being long before the defence system in Flanders was much stronger than it had ever been before. We also suffered some very heavy shell fire & aeroplane bombings
