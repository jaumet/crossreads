<p>From all accounts this latest rumour seems true, as on Wednesday the 25th of September the Bearers fall in &amp; a number of Squads are chosen to join the different Battalions, so as to be ready when going into the Line again. My luck was certainly in today, as we had to draw for this job, &amp; I drew a blank, which meant that I would stay behind with the Reserve Bearers. No movement towards the Line on Thursday the 26th inst, but a route march was held instead. The Ambulance is standing by expecting to move at any time.</p>
<p>More glorious news to hand this week, a wonderful Advance took place in Palestine, &amp; over 40,000 prisoners were captured.</p>
<p>27th September 1918.<br/>Our Division move towards the Line &amp; at 5:30 p.m. the Ambulance started off along the road, in rear of our Brigade. We experienced rather stiff march, about 8 miles, at mid-night we arrived at a ruined village, &amp; we sleep anywhere we can amongst the debris till morning. The following day we were able to look round, &amp; inspect our home &amp; make it a little more respectable. Startling news to hand today &ndash; Bulgaria asked for 24 hours Armistice to consider Peace Terms. Here we have the beginning of the end, the first of our enemies to climb down.</p>
