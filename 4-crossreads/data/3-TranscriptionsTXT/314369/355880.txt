 Find out this morning I am for Alexandria by the "Assaye" A whole lot of slightly wounded are taken ashore during afternoon in lighters About 7 pm all the men for the Assaye were transferred   &amp; put into wards. Put in a very comfortable night I hear today that through some mistake the 18th Bat has been terribly cut up only two days after they had landed!

 First thing I knew this morning was my mate waking me to come for breakfast. We are given clean shirts   &amp;  Pajamas   &amp;  so have a chance to get clean again Move out of Mudros at 8 pm. Retire to bed at 8.30 pm. but am unable to sleep so go on deck   &amp;  make a bed there w/- better luck   &amp;  do not wake until about 6 next morning
