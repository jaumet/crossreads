Friday 14 February 1919Rafa41 today & feel every year of it - but I've not altogether wasted my life.Cold better but so many men being in one Camp, not too healthy.Nothing new re sailing - may go end of this month.  Dolly will not be with me, but another boat.  Sorry but can't be helped.  Love to all, your son.
