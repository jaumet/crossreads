<p>23/12/16 E Camp &amp; Needle Trench<br/>A wet gusty morning which later cleared up somewhat. Completed arrangements for move into the supports this afternoon. About 200 men will be remaining behind. A rather tragic thing happened this morning. King our M.G.O. had a brother in the 58th and had received no word of any casualty to him. This morning I sent King to the cookhouse to arrange our rations. Three wooden crosses were standing outside. One of these bore his brother's name. a great shock to King. Mud very bad &ndash; am putting on sandbag gaiters. Trench boots make feet too sore so am sticking to the ankle ones. We leave our valises here and can say goodbye to comfort from now onwards. The men carry up 48 hours rations on them and also draw 2 bombs each. Am trying to carefully select the men for English leave but much heartburning results, I know. Noticed a story without words. A grave on which was a steel helmet with a 2 inch hole in it &amp; a 77 mm case &amp; nosecap.</p>
