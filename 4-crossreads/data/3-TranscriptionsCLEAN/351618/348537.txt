  
 simply delightful. There was a bit of shooting at our gun pit early in the evening. To-day I am in charge of guard over Prisoners. Not a pleasant piece of work. The guard has the worst part of it having to stand out in the sun etc and see they do their work. I have never seen such persistent flies as these Turkish breed. They settle in your bread and jam on your tea dixie mess tin & stick like lice. 
 It is wonderful how callous one is now to the flying bullets & the splashing shrapnel. 
 The strapping of our prisoners to the wheel was not a very enviable piece of work. Two female mules [?] belonging to some Turkish farmer wandered round behind our firing line & seemed perfectly at home. The part round our Battery cook house seemed a very attractive [Indecipherable] to them.
