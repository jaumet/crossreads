After lunch football matches were on the board &ndash; inter company goes. General Paton came round and inspected our lines. By 4 p.m. it was nearly dark. Dull grey clouds very low, bleak bare trees, a ground mist rising and a raw cold striking through one. Such is the outlook in this part of Belgium on an afternoon at the beginning of winter.

Long and cheerless evenings these of winter! Lecture after Mess.
