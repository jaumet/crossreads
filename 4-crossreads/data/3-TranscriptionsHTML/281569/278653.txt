<p>8 April, 1916 Saturday</p>
<p>Revielle at 5.15</p>
<p>At 11.30 last night we were awakened by a loud burst of fire &amp; at first it seemed as if Mt Senussi had called on us but after a while we heard that it was the Tommy's ammunition that was alight, they lost 5 machine guns &amp; 65000 rds of 303 amm, some poor beggars will fall in.</p>
<p>Sports were held today &amp; we got a fair share of the prizes; just after lunch a "Hoah" paid us a visit, all day it had been frightfully hot &amp; a change came along at 12 oclock in the shape of one of their notorious winds, it came over in a wall of sand 15 miles wide &amp; heaps of wind to push it along, the horses felt it very badly &amp; also some of the men, we all came out of it like niggers.</p>
<p>Mail today arrived but again there was nothing for me, have given up expecting letters.</p>
<p>Bed 10.</p>
<p>April 9, 1916 Sunday</p>
<p>Revielle at 5 as usual.</p>
<p>Day very warm again after yesterday &amp; heaps of dust, horses &amp; men got out to the Palms as usual. I slipped out as well on the old scrap.</p>
<p>Shipping on the Nile pretty heavy today, merchandise by the boat load going down, made a box for the bosses mummy &amp; fixed up his pannier which by the way is pretty full of Troop stuff.</p>
<p>Wrote letters all the afternoon &amp; went for a stroll after tea. Fever pretty prevalent here now &amp; H Q's has had 2 cases of it &amp; 2 of sunstroke within the last few days, 2 more of our chaps gone to hospital, one with a fall from a horse &amp; the other with tempt.</p>
<p>Played cards until 9.30, then turned in.</p>
