<p>There are several things I would like to hear about from home, however, &amp; those are, anything which concerns any of our friends, &amp; also copies of any of the casualty lists which include any names we know. There are probably things which have happened, since we have been aboard, that we will never hear <strike>any</strike> anything about unless from home or by chance, and as the chance is very small, there is only one alternative left. Anything that happened between the time we embarked &amp; the time we get to our destination, which I am not allowed to specify, but   <strike>which</strike> of which you can form a pretty fair opinion will be of interest; anything that happened before or after that, as far as the war is concerned I will probably hear as soon as you. All Australian views, of course, will always be acceptable. I have not yet started a diary, because I thought it hardly worth while writing the same thing down day after day, &amp; week after week; but from the day we disembark, I shall certainly do so. A number of things are sure to happen which would not get through the censor, but which will be interesting &amp; harmless after the war is over: in fact they have already happened, &amp; I have made a special note of anything worth remembering. I hope it wont be very long before you will be hearing all this news from my own lips. Its so much easier to talk about than write about. Give my love, or all you can spare, to everyone, &amp; expect a letter by next mail.</p>
<p>Your loving Son<br/>Arthur.</p>
