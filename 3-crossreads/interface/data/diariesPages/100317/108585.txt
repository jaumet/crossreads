21/6/18
Spent the whole day abed on account of the prevailing epidemic "la grippe". It was a showery dank day and quite extraordinary for this country ? rather like Colombo weather. A big gun drops shells at intervals in this map square, the sound of the gun going off can be plainly heard and then a silence while no doubt the shell is a mile or so up at the height of its trajectory and then a gradually growing rapid screech as it plunges down. General Paton came in for a yarn about the War and tells me the 3 Batt. per Bde stunt is probably off. Doctor wants to evacuate me ? but Nein. Two officers (Patterson Westaway) and a number of men sent away with this cursed epidemic. Might be able to wangle a bit of leave out of it in due course.
