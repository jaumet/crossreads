<p>26 May 1918 Sunday<br/>Had dinner with Father George &amp; other priests at Salesian Monastery Bethlehem, a lot of politics are mixed up with Religion here &amp; <strike> ecclesiastics go in for propaganda work like our R.Cs do.</strike><br/>Then saw the St Joseph's Convent girls play a Farce for the benefit of a French general &amp; staff rather amusing I enclose you programme.<br/>Sorry to see Studs like Cobran being sold up, I always liked those sheep.  Sheep are very healthy here &amp; brown &amp; colored wool fetch big prices for Persian carpets.  Camel Hair, Donkey Hair, Goats Hair all used for Clothing by Bedouins.</p>
