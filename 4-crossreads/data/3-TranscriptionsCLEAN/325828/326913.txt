 My dearest Father, Since writing to you on the 2nd inst we have shifted camp.  The weather here is pretty rotten & everywhere there is mud ankle deep.  It is a marvel if no rain falls here for 3 days.   The  It has been bitterly cold with strong winds blowing, & I have been very thankful for my warm clothing & especially the sheepskin vest.  We are expecting to move again to-morrow, perhaps for the last time, & I will be glad when we get to work & get settled.  Owing to reorganisation, I am leaving the Transport as far as I know at
