<p>My Dear Mother</p>
<p>Last Wednesday I received a letter from Beryl Luke in which she mentioned you were conversant with the sad news. That was the first I had telling me that you knew at home. I have known about 3 weeks now, ever since about the 19th October, but still the letters have been coming and coming with dates up to the 14th Sep, and all were cheerful &amp; bright, and they all found me as heavy as lead and just wondering how I could ever face the future with any interest. They made it particularly hard for me here, and only reminded me more &amp; more of what Alan was to us all. About 2 days after Beryl's letter, which was a perfectly sweet one, I got Hazel's. Hazel's was most comforting too, and written in such an understanding way, it was just great, Olly is the luckiest chap in the world. Poor Kid, I'll bet she has been just the bravest of all at home, and yet I know only too well</p>
