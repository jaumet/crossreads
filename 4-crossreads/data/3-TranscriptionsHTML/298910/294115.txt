<p>Father Law equal to the occasion, he put his torch on him &amp; said &ndash; Well yes for this time I agree with you &ndash; Anzac very profuse in his apologies when he recognised him.</p>
<p>Sunday  18/3/17</p>
<p>Very mild &amp; fine day. Div. H.Q'rs established 2 miles beyond Bapaume, much patrol fighting going on 7 miles out. Everybody &amp; everything nearly shifting forward &ndash; Fritz set nearly every 3rd Building alight in Bapaume &amp; blew up everything of any use &ndash; everybody moving very cautiously on account of mines &ndash; also very careful of picking up Souvenirs &ndash; we treat all water with suspicion &ndash; Good few trench feet &amp; wounded through &ndash; some L.H. &amp; several Indian &ndash; they report no sight of main body of enemy, ten miles out only patrols. Australians also took La Fransloy &ndash; much to the disgust of 20th Div of Tommys who were reckoning on being first there &ndash; all available Amb men pushing on with Division. Got official news of the Abdication of the Czar.</p>
