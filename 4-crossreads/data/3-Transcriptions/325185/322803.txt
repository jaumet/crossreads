<p>the finest shooting I have ever had. You see we had to attack across a flat for a half mile or more. Then the hill came well we got them as they scrambled up the side no need for a marker you saw when you got a hit. Well there were about fifty Germens got on top of the rise &amp;amp: took cover behind a breastwork looking straight down on us. But they  didnt open fire couldent have had rifles. I suppose they were going to get us with bombs as we came up. So I told them to wait until I went back to the gun crew was going to send the gun around on a flank while we moved as though we were going to go straight up. they wouldent be expecting it from the flank. Well had just told them where to go &amp;amp: was about to walk away when my left arm went limp. I wheeled around just in time to see a head bob down in a shell hole about fifty yards behind us. We made one rush for the place when Fritz stood up Mercy Kamrad,  he got it too only four bayonets through him at the same time. If there were any more of his mates trying the same game it was a caution not to try shooting in the back.Well I had to come away</p>
