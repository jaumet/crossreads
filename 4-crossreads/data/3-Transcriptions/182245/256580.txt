<p>MARCH 1917</p>
<p>6 TUESDAY</p>
<p>Fine but cold wind blowing</p>
<p>all day. I went up for a bath</p>
<p>in the morning &amp; it was great.</p>
<p>Out exercising horses in</p>
<p>afternoon. Jack Hunter went</p>
<p>up to the battery in evening.</p>
<p>I sent out an inkstand to</p>
<p>Jo, the model of a french steel</p>
<p>helmet. Received a parcel</p>
<p>of socks from Linda &amp; a</p>
<p>face washer from the [insec?]</p>
<p>&amp; a letter from Mother.</p>
