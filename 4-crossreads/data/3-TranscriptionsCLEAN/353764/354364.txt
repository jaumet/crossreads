  
 They are very strange people & one has to be very careful. The Buildings, Trains, Trams etc are very nice & I think preferable to Sydney.  Visited Cairo & was very impressed with everything I saw. It is the filthiest City in Creation.  That is the Native Quarters, of course the City itself is just beautiful. 
 23.12.15 Visited Cairo & Suburbs again & part of the Nile.  Called on [indecipherable] & had a good time. Took a Motor Car in the afternoon & did a few hundred miles of country 
 24.12.15  Christmas Eve  Everything was in an uproar.  Fancy 500,000 men all making a noise at the same time.  Richard obtained leave & went into Cairo & visited a few more places. You never saw the like in your life, of Course every second Soldier was drunk & what with them, & the natives shouting out  Verie Good Christmas   Verrie nice Christmas  (of course for a Piastre) it was a sight that one will never forget. I arrived home at 10 & wondered what you were doing on your side
