<p>5th  It is very cool this morning signifying I suppose the approach of winter.</p>
<p>6th  This afternoon our Brigade Band marched to Fargo Hospital and rendered a programme to the patients who number 800, mostly Australians.  There are also about 150 Germans in an enclosure surrounded by barbed and electrified wire and guards with fixed bayonets.  We were told that one of the Germans attempted to throw some iodine in a nurse's face who was attending him but a guard skittled him with an entrenching tool handle.</p>
