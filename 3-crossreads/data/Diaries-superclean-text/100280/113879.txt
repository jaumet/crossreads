it was to be among English people once more, so far this trip had all seemed a dream, but once we arrived in Blighty we woke up, had a bonzer run to London then we all marched around to Victor Horsferry Road reported got fixed up Jock I went up to Wellington Barracks where the Guards are Jock had a brother in law there so we left our packs etc. here
