SUNDAY, AUGUST 31, 1919.
Fine & hot. Tickle got some of the horses
from Piccadilly into yards. Took out
two of mine, one of Tickles & one
each of Alan's & Joans & put them
in 4D. Round the bottom end
and Kimber's Woolshed after foxes
but did not see any.
T. Kenning & C. Gosden started
burning off in Wheelers.
