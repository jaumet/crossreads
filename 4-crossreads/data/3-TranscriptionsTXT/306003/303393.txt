 15-6-16 sleeping;  A telegraph line runs through Qatia, Oghratina, Hod-El-Debabis &amp; it is said goes through to Jerusalem.  we use this line when it suits us probably the Turks do the same. &amp; that accounts for numerous breaks in the line &amp; the line is kept in perfect order from Debakis in our side of the country &amp; we make sure it is cut on the eastern side of where we are speaking to prevent the Turks hearing us; 
 We leave here at 10.30 tonight to proceed to Bir-El-Abd about 6 miles east of Debabis where our aeroplane reports Turks are camped, &amp; I received orders this evening from Capt Downing to repair the line as we go, &amp; get into communication as soon as we arrive, with Bde H.Q which will be at Debabis;  The wells here have been greatly improved &amp; watered all the horses of the Bde without much delay
