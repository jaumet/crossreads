Buire-sur-Ancre & Amiens. Picardy 1/11/16 (than which there are no more tasty). Grave superior vin and creme de menthe.  To the cathedral and sat down on the opposite side to take in the beauty of the frontal stone carving.  Entering we went all round and found that a fragment of the bone of John the Baptist seemed to attract a great deal of attention and much reverence from the devout passers by.  Magnificent stained glass rose windows so extensive that you marvel how the slender tracery of masonry can support its weight.  Public urinals only screen part of the body.  Saw men switch round against walls in open streets - no one took any notice.  Much struck today by the superiority of French organization over ours.  All their young men are sent to the trenches; guards and L. of C. work is done by old men and fathers of families.  They can be billeted at home. With the English strapping young chaps are loafing round guarding Hun prisoners and doing light Base jobs.  It is rotten.  They badge all their trench fighters - the man who has never been right into it has no stripes to show.  With us the coldfooter is screened.  Left by train at 3.40 and arrived back in time for tea.  At 7 pm attended a concert given by "D" Co.  It was rather scratch at first owing to the talent being rusty but improved vastly towards the end.  Quite a break in the monotony and God knows the private soldiers life is monotonous soul killing existence.  Dr James returned from leave.
