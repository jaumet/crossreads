 Dear Mr. Horsefield &ndash; I am sending Mrs. Cheeseman whose husband and son are both at the Front. At present she is receiving the [indecipherable] pension &amp; owing to some trouble now being investigated her allowance is suspended. Her husband made over an allotment to his sister but it will be altered later on. 
 Mrs. Cheeseman has a debt pressing. I am enquiring at the Pay Office tomorrow &amp; will let you know the result later. 
 Yours faithfully B. Booth.
