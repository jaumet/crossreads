<p>the walls are covered with outlines of Thi and his wife, and figures representing all sorts of pastoral objects, men and women, beasts, birds, fishes, crocodiles, rhinocerous, grain, reptiles, and what do you think an outline, here &amp; there, of a handbag such as the ladies carry to day in Sydney.  It must have been a great period for presents because rows &amp; rows of people are depicted as bringing gifts to Thi &amp; and his lady.
