 MAY&nbsp;&nbsp; WEDNESDAY 10&nbsp;&nbsp; 1916 
 How fortunate is he who finds a new joy for each day 
 In doing well the things at which he works away; 
 &nbsp; 
 To him the weeks are never long, 
 And even if his wage be small, 
 There is upon his lips a song 
 That slaves may never learn at all. 
 &nbsp; 
 This world that we&#39;re living in 
 Is mighty hard to beat; 
 You get a thorn with ev&#39;ry rose, 
 But ain&#39;t the roses sweet!. 
 &nbsp; 
 Frank. L. Stanton.
