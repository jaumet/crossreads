<p>Dear Dad, Mum &amp;  George,</p>
<p>I will just be able to get this card posted in time for the mail. Ellis, Dave  Niness &amp;  I are packing up for a week at Alexandria. We are having cooler weather now. 1/6 a day is a strain in this Clime. We have a terrible job to make it last. I will have to cable for some from England because I want to see the sights. I still have &pound;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    5 &amp; Ellis has too, but with a trip to Grimsby 30/ &amp; one to the Island 50/- we will be nearly out on the rocks. We are both well &amp; have not been sick since we left Sydney. It is all the hours we put in sleep that have kept us so well. I must go now. I am going to do 3 General to see Dolly Hale to-night. Hends visiting up here last Tuesday. Love From Billy, Dave, Harry &amp; Ellis</p>
