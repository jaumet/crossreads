<p>Intermittent showers which later modified into bright sunshine. This spell of downpours is by far the heaviest and most consistent since I have been here. The average rainfall hereabouts is 20 inches. 14 has so far been accounted for, and I reckon the last week must have brought the number up to average. The country is green and looking splendid.  No trains have so far passed through owing to the Wady Ghuzu[?]  being in spato. Spent day amongst the camps and secured some fine stuff. The camps are in ideal situations, and owing to percolation are ever flooded out. With Gullett I intend visiting the Camel Corps tomorrow at Rafa.</p>
