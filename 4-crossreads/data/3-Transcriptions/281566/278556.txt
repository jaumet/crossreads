<p>April 23rd In consequence considerable activity was exhibited in the aerial sphere one or two rather exciting duels taking place &amp;  numerous shells being uselessly expended as usual by both sides. Our airmen however show  a considerable amount of daring more than the Germans who with their fast machines fly at a very great height. One of ours in particular flies at rather low altitude backward's  &amp;  forwards with rather monotonous regularity over the enemy lines. Whether he finds it monotonous is rather doubtful for he is constantly under both shell  &amp;  machine gun fire. Early in the morning, the Germans who we are told are usually most busy on Sunday began to drop shells behind our lines.<br/>"Whiz-bangs" ( the popular name for the German 77m) had fallen at the head of our communication trench.</p>
<p>Anzac Day &ndash; Tuesday 25th  April was kept up in the trenches by the Germans who gave our lines a little 'strafing' accounting for several casualties and working parties. On Wednesday the bombardment was continued our guns however taking the chief part in the action.</p>
