<p>January 24<br/>the Nouveau Cirque, stand as the first memories of Ghent.</p>
<p>And Paris ? &ndash; the sun a vivid vermilion lantern in the grey woven mist, the trees of the Tuileries Gardens silver and white, the fountains playing, vivid as newly cut silver, from oval pools of soft blue, and last March our first day was the same.</p>
<p>Brussels in the Opera house &ndash; "Thais", "Orpheus" and Pa [Palliacci ?] and La Tosca, and the lovely rural paintings of red-gilt and golden-gilt men of rose and vermilion skies dull vine leaves and trees and the splendid pagan colour of a naked world.</p>
<p>The last night in Paris saw 'Romeo &amp; Juliet' &ndash; a bon piece with a good ballet:  after Brussels Ballet even the last rows were [indecipherable].</p>
<p>January 25<br/>40.<br/>The great faintly-heard rumour of today is the possibility of Monday being the day of the first draft's leaving.</p>
<p>Afternoon a long wandering through the side tracks through the Chateau grounds.</p>
