10 - But I never did think since I knew anything about it that the medical profession enobled men - or made them courteous in the true sense.I have learnt not to expect any kindness or interest from the Matron - but don't worry about that. I can do my bit as long as I'm physically strong - and I wont  be foolish and over do it. Matron never interfers with my work at all. She isn't the least interested in our work as far as I can see. She is very busy since we came to Cairo - and I see very little of her. We have all the Australian Sisters in Cairo living with us in our quarters now and messing with us. I should think about 200. My room is very comfortable at present. Sister Dowe is on night duty so it leaves only Patsy Blundell and me in the room. I love my work and hope I can go on till the war is over
