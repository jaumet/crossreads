<p>With the 3rd Batt Hdqrs (115) and 2nd Batt 120.<br/>Weather foggy, spent a wild night with bombs, advanced with the infantry to the railway line Nth of Behein, near the railway line, reported with Page and Cooper  to the 2nd Batt 120 Regt. &ndash; Major Grahame.<br/>After the infantry had advanced 500 yds Hdqrs was established in a farm house.<br/>I went back with a despatch and after a  3 hours wait got through to Capt Leneham  at Regt Hdqrs. Answered in the negative. Set off again to the Line but at 12 midnight was still lost, so I turned in at an old cottage for the night. Bitterly cold</p>
