12th June 1916 (con)
as there was not much cloud about. A heavy mist came down on the Bay at 7 oclock. The "Marathon" arrived in the Bay tonight with Infantry 133rd AMC other units; great reception from us on the Argyllshire from the Benalla (also out in the Bay). Now we have, I think, four other troopers here besides our ship. It will be some sight when we all move off. Tonight the latest is that we have a route march to Blazes somewhere. Anyhow it will be a stretch of legs. S. Partridge returned from Wynberg Hospital today. Went under an operation with his arm.

Turned out a beautiful day, although the heavy fog hung about till 11 oclock. Left the ship (marching order) by tug lighter at 1 oclock. Started from docks for route march to Sea Point. A very pretty walk there, and is a swell residential place. Broke off at 12 for dinner which we had by roadside. Bully beef bread c consisted of the dinner. Fell in after to be told of leave granted till 3.45. Great joy. Went straight into Capetown. Had a drink bought some cards and posted them to Sydney. Had afternoon tea at an Australian womans caf in Adderley St. A very fine woman considering all teas given to us boys were by invitation. Nothing much to be done on such short leave. Arrived back at boat at 5.30. A beautiful night with bright moon very clear too. There is another ship coming up (10 oclock) Hope it is another trooper. Nigger's pups born today.
