Anzac
Let the deep guns toll their knell
They who fought so hard and well;
Let the westwind sing a drige
Piling wreaths of Saros? surge. 
Let the shrapnel's fleecy white,
Cloud by day and fire by night,
Deck their graves along the height
?Samothrake? golden crowned
Broods above the hallowed ground. 

Gaba Tepe battle torn
In her sunlight seems to mourn;
Where our southern heroes fell,
Let the deep guns toll their knell.
