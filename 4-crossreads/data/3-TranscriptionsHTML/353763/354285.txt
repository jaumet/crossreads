<p>This morning all is well  -  The Destroyers are <strike>all</strike> out patrolling &amp; AE2 is going to lurk there &amp; see how she gets on  -  She is outside the reef just now  -  We expect the Fleet back today but we don't know definitely  -</p>
<p>The news came thro that De Wet had turned dog on the British in S. Africa  -  This was greatly resented after all the kindness &amp; attention he had from the British  -  I did a 2 hour walk yesterday aftn  -  I saw our well known Silver Eye &ndash; Zosterops coerulescens &ndash; probably &ndash; the same species   -  quite nice to see such a well known chap  -  It reminded me of home  -  I also found the nest of a small bird &ndash; probably a fantail  -  The nest had 2 eggs  -  I wouldn't touch it  -  The small red throated but black backed mother was most anxious about it &amp; few around me just like a fantail will  -</p>
