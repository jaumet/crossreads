He is fairly lonely. His wife after a long illness died about 4 years again and his brother the last of the family died about 12 months ago. I often think of the wonderful lot of S.G.S. boys of the war years. I was Newington. The late K G Robson, Bert Finlay, Vic Coppleson, Walter MacCallum, & still with us Sir Norman Gregg, Jock Rossell, Billy Macdonald, Ned Raine, and not forgetting yourself. Of course there would be others but I have possibly forgotten them or did not know them. Has there been any other eras like that one? Still, I must not go on worrying you. My wishes to you are sincere and may you have a good retirement. I have been retired since 1960, keep reasonably well still I do my best to enjoy life. A good wife, three married somes sons, eight grandchildren and plenty of garden. Yours Sincerely, Rodney Pettit
