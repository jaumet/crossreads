  
 Monday 5 February 1917 
 Just heard that U.S.A. have joined us. This must help surely with SHIPS anyway - Was on outpost all last night a lovely moonlight & starlit night, but heavy dews & cold yet, by day the sand blows, till the jam is like grit & even the ZINC ointment in the Army Medical Tent is turned to KHAKI. 
 I always feel inclined to write down, when I get the chance to have a BATH, it is such a red letter day for a man out here. 
 Hear today that we leave the front line for a spell. 2nd Brigade to relieve us & we go back some 3 days march, all ranks are sorry as the country was improving & our boys like to be the PRIDE of the line.
