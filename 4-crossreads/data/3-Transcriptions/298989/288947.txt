<p>14/1/16<br/>Morning cold very raw out in the desert with the class. Attack and reinforcing the work. Dressed up in borrowed clothes and left camp about 1000 with Jackie McCaul and my man Spendlove. All the way from camp to station returning sentries compliments. Great bustle of transport all along the railway. The native vendors of fruit carry it all round their body inside the clothing. Reached Tel el Kebir station crowded with niggers and soldiers. Bootblacks very busy. "Boots er clean "Junkis" "Eggsercook". One a cripple with either no legs or very deformed who swung along on his hands.</p>
<p>Boarded train at 1100 with Brund and some others and an English colonel told me that at Suvla during the blizzard he lost 5000 of his men with frostbite. A column by Dicky in the Times of 31/12 on Australian marching songs &amp; also details of our evacuation. The stationmaster of the station elaborate gold braided person.</p>
<p>Passing through the usual delightful green irrigation just like a market garden with its groups of workers &amp; odd camels &amp; donkies. Only for the palms the landscape might be an Australian one. The Port Said express has just rattled past. Bedouin tents quaint looking things. Stated that labour is scarce for railways on the fields the peasant earns 4pt a day on railways 12pt and yet there is this dearth. They have to put a levy on the shieks of the villages, scarcely said to be due to religion, perhaps dislike of work though. Approaching Cairo the outlines of the Pyramids became visible. A regiment of LH passing along the road, new requisition.</p>
