Well Miss King I would like to write a lot but I feel dead tired and I have a lot of cleaning up to do, but when I go to England I will tell you a terrible lot of my war experiences and other news of interest.
I sincerely hope you are in the best of health and Best Wishes & every success to all the good Australian Women who are doing so much for us boys. May God protect you all in Australia from from the dangers of war and sickness
Your Sincere Soldier FriendCorporal Bob. Otto.C. Coy. 2nd Battn. A.I.F.
