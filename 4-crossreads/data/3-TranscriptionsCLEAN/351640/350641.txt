  
 disaster of Friday the 19th inst. in the Dardanelles, but of others that are kept concealed from us.  As on previous occasions, it is my hope that the impressions produced upon my thinking centres are entirely wrong.  We must of course in the long run pull through as winners, but the day for such happy event is not yet. 
 At 7 a.m. I heard mass by the Padre McAuliffe. Thereafter a short gallop across the desert. 
 A sister, Jeffries from Tasmania, gave me a few small photographs this morning, tey have been rolled with a large one earlier referred to in this letter & will go forward by the next mail. 
 In order that the pages written upon shall be in good time for the Orient steamer leaving Suez on the 24th inst, they with the envelope will be posted this morning and with my blessings shall be started on their long journey. 
 To my friends from me please wish each a life prosperous, long, and ever happy, with endless goodness, and wealth from Fortune's bottomless horn. 
 To you three like things in super-abundance, conveying them with much love & heaps of kisses from Your loving & affectionate Father John B. Nash
