<p>64 September 22nd<br/>I am able to promenade round the square 3 or 4 times each day now &ndash;</p>
<p>The 6 officers who escaped several days ago have all been captured &amp; are now in cells in this camp &ndash; They were captured right on the border, as they were they were crawling through &ndash; it was only a matter of half an hour &amp; they would have been free again. They say sentries are 4 deep there &amp; the places is lousy with dogs so I think it is practically hopeless to get through now we all feel very sorry for them especially for Robinson &amp; Baerline on account of their previous trouble &ndash;</p>
<p>no concert tonight &ndash;</p>
<p>I exercise myself on the parallel bars &amp; other gymnastic appliances every day now &ndash; &amp; am slowly improving. no parcels again today</p>
