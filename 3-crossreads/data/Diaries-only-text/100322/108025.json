Took a walk up towards the Waxworks but did not go in. An attempt was made to steal our horses last night but failed and I tried a foolish looking chap of the 17th Battalion remanded him for Court Martial. From the Cavalry Barracks last night twelve birds escaped. In days past this never happened ? now corruption is rife. 
At midday went up to the Waxworks and had a look at the horrors there. Took afternoon tea at the mess having first wandered out and done some shopping. A windy thundery and showery day. Spent the evening with the Cornils.
