Saw some fine fish playing around our boat this morning, must have weighed 30 or 40 lbs.
No one is allowed ashore here the authorities in Colombo are willing but our Defence people have forbidden it for some reason or other, so the Y.M.C.A. have been taking orders for silks cigars curios etc they had an order for over @pound;350
It is lovely now one can almost smell the spicy breezes that blow from Ceylon Isle
8.30 Have just heard that the Y.M.C.A. could not get the things ordered the job was too big or something to that effect, we are still taking coal water aboard got some 300 tons of the former latter to collect yet, so theres not much chance of us getting away tonight
Took a snap of the Indians who were having dinner today, they all line up each man is issued
