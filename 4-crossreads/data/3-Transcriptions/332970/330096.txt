<p>every one of these islands has its numerous legends and myths, for these are the waters Ulysses sailed to say nothing of various Grecian heroes. The islands are all steep &amp; mountainous, with occasional red roofed houses nestling into their sides, and are all cut into by narrow precipitous ravines. Further details we <strike>could</strike> were never close enough to see, but I would give worlds for a few hours ramble over their steep sides.</p>
<p>Our pace has been gradually slackening on this old tub of ours, and it transpires that the crew of Greek firemen cannot keep a proper head of steam on. Consequently a call for volunteers has immediately filled the stoke hold with a new crew, and we hope soon to make better progress. It has been heartbreaking to-day, to see the way we were overhauled by two other transports, for they passed us as if we were not going at all.</p>
