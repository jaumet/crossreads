We moved off from Liverpool at midday Monday 21st Aug, the Reinforcements next to go lining up along the line of huts and giving us a good cheer. We made many short sharp hand shakes and many quick good wishes as we recognised amongst the sea of soldier faces our many friends. There were pals who had toiled through the "schools" with us, some fortunate wearing their stars, and others like ourselves, not so fortunate, and there were many good friends in the ranks, starting where I had started 15 months ago, and who will end as many of us will, under the sod in France.
Well, anyway, its worth all the risk and all the hardship just for moments like these, when a man thrills with the emotion bought of a sense of real duty and comradeship.
Stuart, Wilkins, Biden and many others were there, who will soon join us in the big fight, and who we realise are separated only for a short time.
