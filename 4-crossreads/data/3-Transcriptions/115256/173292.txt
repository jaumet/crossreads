<p>Tuesday 2 February 1915</p>
<p>Having had a strenuous day yesterday, "the heads" did not work us very hard to-day.  Getting up at nine o'clock, we did not have breakfast until ten.  The situation of the camp is on the outskirts of Heliopolis, which is, I am informed, is the Toorak or Potts' Point of Cairo.  Excepting the buildings of this place, the landscape is one of sand &ndash; sand and bell tents.  Needless to state, ourselves and our belongings are covered with dust &ndash; brownish yellow Desert of Suez sand.  But the camp is run on sound military lines.  We are under Imperial jurisdiction now, and the difference, even at this early stage, is most marked.  Everything is run on sound military and regimental lines.  There are both wet and dry canteens, and also a caf&eacute; where the troops may purchase cheap palatable and wholesome meals.  Only authorised native hawkers are permitted to enter the lines.  The Arabs are made to do most of the fatigue work, so that all together, we are not going to have such a terribly bad time.</p>
