A consignment of "Washburns Rye Flour brand 000, and Barley Flour- - "War Time" was received at the Bakery. It had a very bad colour, almost black; coarse and mealy, altogether a very bad sample. On experiment it was found that the proportion of it to use to obtain satisfactory results was 50 lbs to 2 sacks, i.e. 560 lbs, or slightly under 10 per cent, and even then its appearance in the loaf was most apparent. 78 men and 24 women baked 63,320 lb rations.
