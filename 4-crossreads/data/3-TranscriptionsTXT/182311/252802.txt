 &nbsp;&nbsp; Hyde Park, Marlborough House, Buckingham Palace, Green Park, Somerset House, Scotland Yard,  The Bank of England  The Inns of Court, Old Bailey &amp; may another famous place was passed sometimes rapidly on top of a bus &amp; sometimes more minutely, making as careful an inspection as time would allow.
