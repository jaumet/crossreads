 Feel a good bit better, done my shift, although I did not feel too bright. Has left me a very heavy cold. 
 For the first time today we got Boat drill, we night men were rudely awakened by the steam whistle blowing &ndash; men rushing all roads to don their life belts &ndash; Drs - Sisters &ndash; Officers, etc all to their alotted places. The A.G.H. men &amp; Doctors &ndash; also all A.M.C. men who are on Hospital duty at the time take up their positions at Hospital &amp; also see that each patient is provided with a belt. Field Ambulance &amp; L.H.F.A. men fall in with the Units to whom they are attached. 
 Saw hundreds of I think Dolphins, they seem to be identical to our Porpoises, but smaller in size, they look just like a lot of pigs frolicking in water. 
 Sea a bit choppy.  a nice cool breeze blowing &ndash; from North  Raining all the afternoon.
