 Huge tomb of priest dust of king Rise beneath our careless tread Where whistl kite swing overhead A thousand thousand wondrous thing Huge shell that roar like railway train Dun smoke burst hurl shatter men The gasp bayonet charg , and then Turn uniform with dread stain Still heap beneath the outspread flag The wolf like captiv 's plead eye The fire parti plod by Quiet head beneath a bloodi rag Wri heap of cloth that clutch sprawl And ghast boy that fight for air twist mouth with eye that stare Blue sky sunshin over all White nake shape all queer slash And those who see and catch the breath And yell with rage and rush in Death Among the rock all leaden splash Huge fleet of ship that come and go With sport shell flung in between And Red Cross ship with row of green And red light move to and fro . If I return to sit and weav These tale , watch the homefir burn , When I return , ? If I return Do you believ that they ll believ . JS Somewher ? Jack Sommer
