 Stan was trying to spin to one of his pals 
 Needless to say Stan was pleased to see me again and also, I, him. 
 A few minutes later we both set out and after half an hours plod found Watto and Keith Little. 
 Being invited to stay for tea we made ourselves at home and the tucker was some class. I am quite satisfied there are cooks and COOKS and stew and STEW. 
 After tea we yarned and focused our windows on each others photos etc then about 10PM. returned home to our respective camps well satisfied.
