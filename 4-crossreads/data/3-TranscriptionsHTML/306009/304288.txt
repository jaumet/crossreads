<p>1915<br/>Apr. 12 Mon.<br/>To-day one of the clerks in our Office had to go into hospital &amp; I am doing his work as well as my own.  Kept busy until 9.45 p.m.<br/>Received 8 letters &amp; 1 Newspaper to-day.  Last week's total was 15 &amp; 3 newspapers - a record for me. There appears to be a very unorganised Australian Army mail service &amp; of letters posted to me from Home, only some have reached me &amp; vice versa.</p>
