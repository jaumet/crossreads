  
 Tuesday 10 October 1916 Similar weather. Took the car down to the school for the 9 o'clock lecture on "Gas Shells" which as usual was followed by practical work in the field. Capt. Barley had left in the early morning on a visit to the Somme. In the afternoon a gas attack on a small scale was carried out, real gases, bombs, explosives & so on being used. It was rather good.
