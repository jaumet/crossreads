<p>head, there is a great string of chaps at the orderly room now sending telegrams to their people, &amp; swearing like troopers at the same time.</p>
<p>I sent a few letters &amp; cards away this afternoon telling them of our quarantine</p>
<p>Had some nice peaches &amp; apricots for tea this evening, but no bread, biscuits</p>
<p>Some of the lads have been fishing off the boat &amp; caught one or two nice flathead &amp; a few young sharks.</p>
<p>A nice Japanese passenger boat anchored quite close to us this afternoon &amp; later on after the health authorities passed her she cleared out, there was also a pleasure steamer ploughed her way down the bay filled with people all waving &amp; cheering, its good to be amongst your own people once more, a lot of the Victorians are getting letters tonight addresses to the ship</p>
