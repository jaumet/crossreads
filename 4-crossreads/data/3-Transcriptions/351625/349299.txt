<p>Dear Father,</p>
<p>I have just received a nice big long letter from you amongst a batch of 5, two of which were from Mother.  I am still with the Batt. &amp; keeping well &amp; fit.  I have just had a spell of 11 days at a Casualty Clearing Station with sore eyes caused I think through dust &amp; sweat, they started with a touch of gas at the C.C.S.  I had nothing to do all day so that I very pleasantly filled in my time writing or reading.  Every evening I used to go down the village near by &amp; have a feed of eggs or chips</p>
