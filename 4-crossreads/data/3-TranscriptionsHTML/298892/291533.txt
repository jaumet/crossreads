Numbers of launches came out and steamed round and round all day until we left.<br/>Of course we are under strict Censorship now and I am not allowed to give any information as to our whereabouts but as soon as we reach some definite address I will let you know if possible. In the meantime I am puzzled what address to give <strike>and</strike> but will make inquiries and  add to the foot of this letter. Anyhow, even if it is sometime before you hear from me again you will know I am in the best of health and thoroughly enjoying the trip.<br/>Give my love to Aunt Kate and Uncle Vesey.<br/>Excuse the scrawl, it is partly the result of a choppy sea and a jumpy head and partly from an extra soft pencil. When I have completely recovered from Mal-de-mer I will endeavour to write you a longer and more presentable epistle.<br/>I have not managed to write to the various donors of socks &amp;c. but will endeavour to do so during the remainder of the voyage.<br/>Your loving son<br/>Eugene.</p>
