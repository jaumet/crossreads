 to the everyday soldiering life which we had, had to endure for some considerable time. The second week was spent in draining jobs in &amp; around our camp trying to make things respectable &amp; to keep the camp as dry as possible. One afternoon while in this camp "A" Company played "B" Company football which ended in a win for the former by 8 points to 6. The Major who had been wounded at Pozieres the second time also joined us when he was made Lt. Colonel in place of the late Howell price. our next move took place during the 15th December when the battalion marched five miles to a railway siding at Meuatte where the troops were put into some circular huts which had a big stove in each &amp; the boys were able to make themselves comfortable. During the five days we remained here the boys were engaged on loading &amp; unloading trains with timber for the front line which was far superior to drilling. During the afternoon of the 19th a big draft of reinforcements arrived which partly filled up the much depleted ranks. That night iron ration (Bully Beef &amp; biscuits) &amp; extra ammunition were issued to all also being told to be ready to move off after breakfast next morning. Early next morning the battalion set off on the march which was only short for we were put into huts in "Melbourne Camp" near Marmetz for the night. We left "Melbourne Camp" after breakfast on the 21st this time marching several miles to Bernafay where we occupied huts for the night. This constant moving of troops about was a wonderful organization for as one unit would leave a camp another would take its place yet the never seemed to be any congestion. During the afternoon of the 22nd, we left Bernafay &amp; after a very long march our company relieved the front line a little to the right of the position we last occupied.
