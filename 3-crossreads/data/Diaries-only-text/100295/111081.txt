3rd October
Went to headquarters photographed the 1st Anzac Staff. I met General Birdwood who spoke with me re my resignation he said he hoped to fix matters up. I am however, inflexible, if my end be not obtained under no consideration will I retain office. 
I remained at Steenvorde all day, taking a rest cure. The battle is to come off tomorrow when we intend taking the ridge in front of Zonnebek. The weather is becoming very wintry considerable rains fell during the night. Given two fine days we will gain our objective beyond doubt. The mass of artillery is appalling nothing can withstand against it. Our supplies of shells munitions is endless one cannot but feel sorry for the wretched devils on the Boche side. Germany cannot win might just as well give up,
