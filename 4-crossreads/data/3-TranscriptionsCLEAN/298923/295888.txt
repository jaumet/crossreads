  
 10 August 1918 Saturday  Tom Kidney  met me at the Anglo American Hospital he said he had a letter from Miss Mack & of course asked for you- He drinks a bit too much & looked besotten I expect tomorrow he will want to borrow money-   I enclose Photo  Everything is going on well at Hospital but Dolly is remaining till about 21st so the Baby will be well looked after. Went with Cuth Fetherstonhaugh to do some shopping my leave is up on Monday   Cuth goes next week too.
