<p>Saturday 10 November 1917</p>
<p>This morning went shopping with Aldy to GAMAGES a great Store for TOYS etc:-  Had lunch at "Frascatis" &amp; then saw them off home again to NORFOLK. Laura rings up, she is to go into a Private Hospital on Tuesday for some minor operation, nothing serious though she says.</p>
<p>Cold better but the days are very bitter. I may try &amp; see the Droys next week if I don't go away.</p>
