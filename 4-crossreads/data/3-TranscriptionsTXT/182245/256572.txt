 FEBRUARY 1917 
 26 MONDAY 
 Fine &amp; Sunny most of the&nbsp;day 
 &amp; nice &amp; warm. I was stableman 
 for the day. Capt Campbell 
 inspected again in the evening. 
 Serj. Major. Paton (or commonly 
 known as Satan) took 
 charge of the waggon&nbsp;lines 
 instead of Serj. Macintosh, much 
 to everybodys dissapointment. 
 We had to turn out &amp; get 
 ammunition at 8 pm but 
 were&nbsp;back at 10. A team 
 went up &amp; brought our 
 gun back to its position.
