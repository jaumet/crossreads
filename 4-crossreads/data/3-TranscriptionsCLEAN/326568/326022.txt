  
 June. 1st.  After a run of varied weather across Indian Ocean, we reached Fremantle this morning & experienced (some on board) the welcome home. After disembarking W.A. troops, we had leave & I went up to Perth. Fine Sunday afternoon. 6th.  Arrive off Outer Harbour, Adelaide at 6 a.m. & disembarked troops at 1 p.m. & left at same hour.  Glorious day.
