<p>Still covered in snow. Inspected H.Q. billets this morning. Afternoon expected Sir John Hobbs but he did not arrive. In the evening there was to be a concert run by the Y.M.C.A. by artists who were to come from Charleroi. Transport went wrong and they did not turn up which was a pity as Billjim and his mademoiselle had assembled en masse. A walk this afternoon across the snowcovered country showed much beauty in white. All right for a change, a few days of this snow are enough. Had interview with several officers this evening regarding jobs on Transport and other matters. Our electric light has partially failed and the village is very quiet indeed.</p>
