<p>Luna Park Hosp.<br/>Cairo<br/>18th July 15<br/>My dear Mother<br/>Just the usual weekly note to keep you aware of the fact that I am up to the 18 carat standard. My wounds are now absolutely healed up &amp; nicely too. I have massage treatment now on my left thigh I walk with a big limp &amp; am pretty crook on walking up stairs etc. They gave me a very nasty wound there the marks will never leave. I expect to be sent convalescent any day now &amp; when I am good on my feet again back to the boys at the front. My section has been badly knocked about the younger Stafford is missing poor beggar you know what missing means against any enemy like ours. The whole battalion is new now the huge gaps filled with reinforcements. It will hurt a chap to go back to see all new faces &amp; miss the old ones. We were a fine crowd "Braunds Boys". When we left here I suppose its all in the game. It is a sad business this.</p>
