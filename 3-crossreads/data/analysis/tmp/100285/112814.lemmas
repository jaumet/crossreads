 While I was work on my list last night a runner came along enquir for Sgt Barwick , I was busili engag at the time I bless him , it appear he came from Lieut Gribbl , I wonder what on earth he could be want , I soon found out when I look at the sprawl spideri write , want me to Lend him a few shill for a few day , he was as drunk as a lord one could easili see that by the write , booz was what he want it for , he got noth off me , I told him I was broke that if he call round in a few day time I would see what I could do for him , that 's what drink doe for a man , I feel sorri for Jack at one time he was one of the straightest men in the Forc , never drank swore or had anyth to do with women , now
