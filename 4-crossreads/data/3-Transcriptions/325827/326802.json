<p>R 10.9.16<br/>19th May 1916<br/>Souvenir for Anna enclosed</p>
<p>Dear Father Mother &amp; Ann<br/>I have just been one of the fortunate ones tonight &ndash;I received about 10 papers 2 parcels of sox and two letters. They have all been to Alex &amp; readressed to 1st Au Div Artillery &amp; all endorsed "not known FAB" &amp; considering that 15th  F.A.B. is in the 2nd Division the delay is needlessly long. I am fairly hard on sox and this lot of 4 will set me up for quite a time. The two parcels were in your handwriting so someone at home is guilty of the kind thought &amp; work re the sox. Thanks to whoever sent them. I did not notice any names attached to them so whoever should be thanked will be by this. I have written to Ol regularly &amp; she has the latest news. Today has been one starting with the noise of guns in one direction, misty &amp; warm. Later it was a perfect day, sunny now artillery plenty of planes including two enemy which got a real peppering from our guns but got away untouched. There is a wonderful fascination in watching the flash of light in the sky, the puff of smoke &amp; wondering from near the shell has gone to the plane. It isn't so nice watching our own getting shot at &amp; though the sky is like a mass of white clouds from shell bursts I haven't seen one of our planes brought down yet, though of course a proportion must get hit &amp; brought down. Our men are just "great" in the air. With a dictionary in my hand &amp; much shocking French grammar</p>
