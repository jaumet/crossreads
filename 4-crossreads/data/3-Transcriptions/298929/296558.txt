<p>29th  Our posy which was called sleepy Valley has been renamed ugly corner.  We have been able to settle down into a trench (where we were O.K.) so far, but He caught us on the hop yesterday.  We got down all right but had left our gas-masks about 15 yards away so we had to run the gauntlet to get them.  C'est le guerre.</p>
