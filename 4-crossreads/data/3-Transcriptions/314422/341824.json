<p>A beautiful day but rather cold. Last night there was some intense artillery activity and again for a little while this morning.<br/>There is great hostile aerial activity today. The news in the papers is good. Both the French &amp; English have had victories in Italy as well as the Italians. The enemy is driven beyond the Piave. The Turks have sustained another big disaster North of Jerusalem in Palastine. It is very cold here with heavy rains &amp; storms.<br/>The Allies are to make an official reply to the German Peace note</p>
