  
 4 Mrs Forsyth and all at Rockcliff - To change the subject for a minute - I am just admiring one of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen - Time 5.50 p.m. Our Battery Headquarters is overlooking the sea, and I can look right out over Imbros and Samothrace over which the sun is just dropping. The Western sky is just a mass of crimson & purple clouds and the sea absolutely calm -  It is  one of those scenes that one often sees in print but seldom in reality. Last night we had a heavy thunderstorm, which is always followed in this parts by this beautiful sky colouring. These Headquarters of ours have proved an enormous boon as one can come down after being relieved from observation work or whatever we may be on, and have as much peace and quietness as it is possible to get on the whole of the position until it is time to take up duty again - Well dear Father & Mum, this brief note must suffice for this week. With many many thanks for those splendid togs - Fondest love to selves & Pat I am etc Terence
