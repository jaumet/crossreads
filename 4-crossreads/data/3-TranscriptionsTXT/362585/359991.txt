 France 2.2.17 
 My dear Mrs. Ferguson, 
 Ginger &amp; Sox very welcome indeed.  Thank you so much.  The ginger was excellent.  I would like all its friends sent over as reinforcements from time to time.  Each draft will be duly acknowledged. 
 I have been having a very busy time writing letters to all the people whose letters have been piling up here while I was away. 
 I have conscientiously cut out all the parts that have to be answered and have burnt the rest.  I have great intentions but the trouble is that my present quarters are so comfortable that everyone comes in for a yarn and a smoke &amp; the letters must wait. 
 Am writing to Dorothy tonight if not interrupted. 
 Best love to all. 
 Affectionately yours C.R.Lucas
