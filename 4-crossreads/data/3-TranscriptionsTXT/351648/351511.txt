And how is the Authoress tonight ma Cherie?  I hope flourishing & happy - you lucky dog!  I picture you to myself reveling in the surf at Manly to which spot you told me in your last that you were going for the summer & my envy knows no bounds, here in this dog darned hole of mud & snow the yearning for a day of warmth is very great.  However everything comes to those who wait is a true saying, I'm finding it so myself even & have no cause to complain as my luck seems to have turned lately (&here's where I blow my own trumpet) seeing that I got a Military Cross about New Year & have just got my Majority.  I see that I shall have to swank a bit - what?  I certainly didn't do anything to deserve either, & my good fortune I attribute entirely to that fickle jade "Luck" with a capital L.  So in future please address me as Major Josh & be more respectful!  No thought much less
