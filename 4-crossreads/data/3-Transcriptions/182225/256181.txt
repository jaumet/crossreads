<p>Cool southerly wind blowing all day. Dagging Point sheep in woolshed yards &amp; got 30 ration sheep out of them in morning Linda &amp; self drove down to Middle paddock bore &amp; then up to the place where &quot;our home&quot; is to be. We both wish it could be commenced [completed overwritten by commenced]&nbsp;at once. Took some photos of the place. Came home through Wheelers &amp;&nbsp;4D. My last night at home before sailing, was wondering when &amp; under what conditions I would next see 4D. [any?] I ought to have some very fine experience before I get back again.</p>
