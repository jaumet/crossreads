<p>[The following paragraph crossed through.]  Went KHAN YUNUS to take summary of evidence in another <u>GROG</u> case. Beer does not do much harm, but the rotten whisky men get hold of causes a lot of trouble. Stayed the night &amp; returned in morning. Had letters from Laura, the wife &amp; Papers from Mrs. Cotton &ndash; Charlie had gone back to France.</p>
<p>Much of the Harvest is now being gathered by the inhabitants, in behind our lines. A broader Railway &amp; Pipe line &amp; many other improvements I noticed in my ride today.</p>
