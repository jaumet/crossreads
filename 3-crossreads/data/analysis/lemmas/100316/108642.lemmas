Tomorrow there is to be a present of medal by Gener Birdwood at the Chateau . Had Stewart and Sutherland up and gave them a rous up about the Adjutant 's work . The former is most unsatisfactori late and am determin to take some step with him unless there is soon a veri consider improv in his work .

The Hun is expect to attack about the 8th inst . At mess our Band play veri well and drew quit a crowd . A lumber crowd of tank went rumbl past along the road . A veri pleasant and balmi even and I spent it talk with first old Major Dooley and , afterward , various other .
