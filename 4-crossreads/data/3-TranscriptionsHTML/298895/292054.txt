<p>old Ford &amp; went in to collect drugs at the depot in Albert.  Very strict in saluting there now as 'tis Army Headquarters and passes signed by the A.P.M. are necessary to get in.  I don't blame them for insisting on the salute, 'tis really the outward &amp; visible sign of discipline when out of the line &amp; most necessary, in fact I believe in being regimental.  Scored my mail today but not from home.<br/>Thursday 26th. April.<br/>Still fine weather.  Guns started off at full force again so apparently the second hop over has finished protem. By the paper our Air Service has gained some notable victories &amp; the prisoners of the stunt number over 3000 with some guns.  Went to "Millencourt" today by horse &amp; had tea with the 12th. where I found Blackall installed as dispenser.  Had a good outing &amp; arrived back just on dark.</p>
