<p>19/9/15  Incident last night's dust up. One man horribly wounded running up and down firing line. Sergt. "Why the - - don't yer get down to the hospital". Wounded man "They are going to charge, man". The idea of being at the hospital while fun going on was too unthinkable  Murphy, C.O. batman , tearing up the firing line with rifle and bayonet. Stopped by Davis. What are you doing here? Murphy "I've come up for me shots Sir". Badly injured carried off on stretchers, cursing awfully &ndash; not with pain but with rage at being outed before getting blood on their bayonets. The language of the army is awful. The Territorials' is most filthy as their national swear is much more disgusting than ours. At the same time the expression some of them put into their swearing is delightful. Two from bush smoking  &amp; a big silence then. <br/><u>One</u> The Southland had er narrer escape with the torpeder? (Pause puf puff puff.) Then.<br/>"There's some b&mdash; good men in the 21st Batt.!<br/><u>Tother</u> "My b&mdash; oath there are!"
