<p>My dearest Father,<br/>You will see by the address that we have at last changed our address.  On Saturday the 12 of us received word to join the Transport section of our Unit.  This latter is at Tel-el-Keber, but the ambulances &amp; transports are here.  We were put through our test for driver, which was a riding test in other words.  I got through it O.K. as did all of us excepting two.  So once more I am at work amongst my beloved horses &amp; am very well satisfied.  We have about 78 horses in our section which works out about 3 horses per man.  After 6 o'clock reveille we mostly exercise them till 8 o'clock.  The tucker out here is splendid and there is plenty to occupy our time which passes very quickly.  We are only about 20 minutes run in the train from Cairo, &amp; it seems a very pretty place indeed especially that part round the railway station.<br/>A good number of English people are living out here, &amp; with the gardens well laid out &amp; the streets too, it presents a very pleasing picture to the eye after the glaring sand of our last camp.  They have some very fine horses out here all of them are easy to handle. (with a few exceptions) &amp; of course the work in the waggons is interesting.<br/>It is rather curious as to where our letters that are sent from Australia.  One or two of our crowd have received letters which were addressed to them at Melbourne, but other than these, we haven't received any at all.  Yet A.M.C. men that we have met out here, who left</p>
