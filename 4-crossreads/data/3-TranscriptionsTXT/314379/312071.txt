led by an American destroyer and followed by the "Aeneas". The destroyer only took us a few miles and bid us farewell. Whilst in Limon Bay an American aeroplane made several flights over our heads and a few destroyers and a submarine kept patrolling the entrance of the Bay.After another 4 1&frasl;2 days stretch on the briny we, very much to everyones surprise anchored off the capital of Trinidad, Port - of - Spain - British West indies. The Aeneas had arrived a few hours before us. Prior to our entrance we passed islands on both sides, very similar in appearance to those already described just previous to our enterance to the Panama Canal but these were larger. It eventually proved that what we thought the largest of these was the mainland of Venezuela, will be seen on reference to any map. After passing through very calm waters we anchored, as already stated just off Port - of - Spain. The shallowness of the water would not allow us to approach to the nearest wharve. Port - of - Spain from here (about 4 miles out) looked more like a country village and the boys got a great surprise when they marched practically right through it. They were all greatly delighted to hear that permission had been given to the effect that half of the troops could go ashore one day and the other half the following day. The first landing was made on the Monday, the day after we arrived. It was a great sight to see the means of transport and the happy expression on the faces of all those participating. Only one steamer was available and as over a thousand had to go ashore each day, a big sort of barge or tug, ordinarily used for coaling, was attached to each side of the steamer despite which we were packed like sardines - this however they did not mind - they were prepared to undergo almost anything to get on terra firma after our long confinement on this ship. it took nearly an hour to get to the shore as it was a tremendous pull for the our steamer and
