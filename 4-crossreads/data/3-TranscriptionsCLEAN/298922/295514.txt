 Am afraid writing is impossible at times. Raided Turkslast night. They lost 100 killed, we a few. Still doing these days & nights as well. Owing to a fog during one of our RAIDS we lost a good chance. 
  Out all night & in the morning were surprised at seeing our Division marching towards us, i.e. towards  BEERSHEEBA or BIR SABA originally BIR meaning WELL - EL place of SABA - Seven - 7 Wells -  our intelligence!!! said it had been evacuated & we simply had to march in. Well we are back in our old Camp not in BIR SHEEBA tonight  - VERY HOT by day & heavy FOGS by night - wets everything.
