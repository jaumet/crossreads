<p>France. 5/2/1916 [there is a cross and note, possibly in another hand, indicating that the date is actually 1917]<br/>My dear Father.</p>
<p>Was feeling very blue yesterday till I got your ever welcome letters of Novr 21st   and   Dec 12th  the first for ten days and I was beginning to wonder what had happened as Sis wrote some days ago and told me she had forwarded them &ndash; mails are very irregular here</p>
