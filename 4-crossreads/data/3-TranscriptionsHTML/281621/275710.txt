<p>Sunday 5<br/>Beginning of 4th year of war &amp; still no prospect of "victorious" ending though prospects of a compromise</p>
<p>Monday 6<br/>Beautiful day. Walk to Appleshaw through most beautiful private grounds with Cotterell</p>
<p>Wednesday 8<br/>Move to another part of camp where after having my teeth attended to, I will be "fit for France".</p>
<p>Friday 10<br/>Twenty two to-day.<br/>In to-days paper I notice that Capt Aspinal has been killed in action. He was a fine chap &amp; his loss will be deeply felt.</p>
