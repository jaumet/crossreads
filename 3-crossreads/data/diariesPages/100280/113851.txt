The trench we are holding is the main one of the "Hindenburg line" in a few places where it has not been battered down by shell fire a good 10 feet deep fairly wide, the "traverses" are especially strongly built look like great buttresses of stone, this trench is also provided with big deep dugouts there are any amount of dead Germans in them these dugouts are more than welcome to us once we get into their trench, for there all our wounded are taken
