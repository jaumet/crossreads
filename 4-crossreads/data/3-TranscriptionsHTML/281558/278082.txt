<p>Bordon &amp; had about 1 &frac14; miles to go to where the R.O.D. [Railway Operating Department] were camped : in M.Q.s like Tidworth</p>
<p>Saturday Jan 26th</p>
<p>Bordon shifted camp in afternoon about 4 miles to Longmoor : drew blankets beds etc &amp; then enjoyed a good nights sleep</p>
<p>Sunday Jan 27th:</p>
<p>Longmoor : fatigue in morning : went for a stroll to Liss in afternoon &amp; as  the day was glorious we enjoyed it : to Liss again after tea : this camp is surrounded by moors &amp; ought to be very pretty in the warmer seasons :</p>
<p>Monday Jan 28th</p>
<p>Longmoor : fatigue in morn : nice route march in afternoon : as the marches  are in light dress &amp; not too long I ought to be able to stand them :</p>
