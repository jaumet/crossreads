The lads were very taken with the Rickshaw boys, fine big Zulus painted all over, wearing large horns & feathers on their heads. They spent their time running round the city drawn by these great good natured niggers who, to attract your attention when passing, prance and bow like a fine blooded well conditioned race horse.  Without a doubt they are the finest race of men physically that I have so far seen.  I can realise now what Rourke's Drift was, and can conjure these docile chaps really in earnest, led by Unslopogaas, Charka or Cetewayo.  Thank goodness we are fighting the Germans!
Many of the boys were taken about by Civilians in buggies & motors.

I suppose I have given my military address to half a doz. people of this kind.  I make a wager that every man on the boat received an invitation during the two days there, to come and dine with a family!  The open heartedness of these brother colonials is something which I will never forget.  Two Ladies took Q.M.S. McComas, C.S.M. Clayton, Sgt Moran, Sgt Swan, & myself home to a grand residence and sat us down to a spanking feed.  They had prepared the meal and then gone
