<p>with water &amp; very rough.<br/>4 days ago a big shell lobbed fair on one of the big huts &amp; blew it to smithereens luckily no one was in it, but yesterday things were not so fortunate, a shell landed in another hut which was crowded &amp; every man was killed 30 in all.  Just here they have a wet canteen &amp; sell English beer &amp; stout 1 franc a pint I think they charge for it.</p>
<p>I have been very crook the last 3 or 4 days, every bone in my body aches &amp; I have a pet of a cold, but tonight I feel a little better, perhaps it is because we are back among our own Coy.  The Sergeants are sleeping away from the men up here, we have a small hut or rather 2 of them to ourselves.</p>
<p>It has been very windy &amp; showery today, but no ways cold, but the ground thawing has made it very sloppy.</p>
