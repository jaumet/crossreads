  
 Sunday 23 February 1919 Went to Marie's at 1.30 pm & then we went to a concert at Albert Hall. Gee it was good. The hall is glorious & so was the orchestra & the girl who sang. We got back home at 5 & found 3 visitors. Went in & got tea ready & Janet turned up, so also did two more visitors. Had tea & then the visitors left & we three had dinner & then we rushed off to get my train for Edinburgh. Got a good bunk too. 
 Monday 24 February 1919 [S. Matthias] Arrived Edinburgh at 8 am. Went to the Royal & got a room. Then had brekker & went out to Comely Bank but Annie was ill in bed with kidney trouble. Had a good talk with her & then came back here for lunch & went out to Corstorphine. Both Auntie & Uncle are well. They both took me to Adolf's he was working on a motor carbo. We didn't stay long. Went back to Comely Bank & met uncle & after tea he took me to York Place where I met some artist pals of Marie's. Stayed there till 10 pm & then came back to the hotel to bed
