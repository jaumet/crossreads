<p>those birds that run up over the rocks you often see them up the gully at home, Hal knows them well - Mountain Grouse I think they are.</p>
<p>2nd September</p>
<p>Part of the mail has arrived bringing one letter from you with the enclosure of Mrs Leash&#39;s. Its date is 7th July; but you say Father wrote on 26th June, so I expect moremail will be waiting for me when I come in from out-post tomorrow night. The last letters I had before this mail were 19th June and a letter from Sydney I got today was dated 17th July - so I expect there is another one to come from you yet. On reading your letter over again I see that Fred continued it on 12th, so you next letter may not have been in time to catch this mail.</p>
