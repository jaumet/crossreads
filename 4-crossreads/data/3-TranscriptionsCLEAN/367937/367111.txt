  
 Lyttleton Just before you left 
 My darling old Rob I cant think of anything to say - so will just say it - but you know wherever you are when you open this we are sure to be thinking of you - it will be worthwhile going away just to come home again - I am not fretting darling because I feel so absolutely we are all in Gods hands - you are just doing your duty, & all is right.  Such a lot of talking going round here - & I cant write!! Your loving & D Mother
