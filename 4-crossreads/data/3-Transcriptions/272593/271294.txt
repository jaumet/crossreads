<p>very serious offence, for they can so easily give the show away &amp; cause a lot of trouble for noise always attracts fire.<br/>Funny to say the neutrality ceased tonight for they fired at me while going out to our outposts &amp; they also had a pot at the machine gunners going out, so I had to take the 3rd Batt. relief in a rotten old trench, it was pretty late by the time the last of us got away &amp; we had a long weary march in front of us to Bazentin No 5. Camp  I was just about knocked out by the time we sighted our camp &amp; I simply threw myself down &amp; went to sleep &amp; did not wake up till 10 next morning.<br/>We had a good breakfast for there was a lot of parcels waiting for us</p>
