<p>11/8/19 Chemnitz<br/>Cleared port about 7 and Miss Edith Campbell was there to say adieu. It came on very rough and I was seasick &ndash; many others too. In the evening it was calmer and bright moonlight. We steamed into a shining path of silver moonlight. On the horizon a tinge of aurora australis.</p>
<p>12/8/19 A rough tempestuous day with huge seas sweeping the decks so dangerously that we had to order everyone below. Showers of spray. Tried a number of orderly room cases. One of breaking into the hold with a master key which I confiscated. There is a bad criminal gang aboard this ship. Turned into bed after dinner but slept none too well owing to heavy rolling all night.</p>
