  
 5.  the laughing and chattering & clattering in the next room because there is a wooden door between our two rooms, hung over only by curtains on their side. I had a note from Gwen Bateman last week, short, for they are busy of course.  Their time is more than half gone now at Omdurman, and they expect to return to Cairo at the end of June.  She is a perfect darling, almost the nicest I have ever met & it would have been delightful if they had been here now.  The photo she sent me I am enclosing but it scarcely gives any idea of what she is like, she is really charming.  Mr Leckie on the left hardly appears.  I heard from him about six weeks ago & he was then in the Royal Horse Artillery in Camp in England; have not heard since.  Later   I have just heard through the Sergeant's wife of someone who is going to Australia on the Osterley to-morrow, she has been delayed, and so after all I shall be able to get this through to you, it is far more than I had hoped, for the "someone" is going to take the letter for me.          Since I wrote all the first part I have had your cable dear people.  It was so good of you to send it & came as a great surprise.  I wish I knew what to do and could answer you right away one way or the other, but I think I shall just have to wait a little while yet.  You will not misunderstand I know, and I for my part have not any doubt of the welcome waiting for me if I do come home.          It is so difficult to know just it is one's duty to do, if only I knew what I were meant to do, it would be such a relief.  Somehow I cannot feel that I ought to turn homewards yet though I rather dread the thought of England.     However I feel sure it will all come clear for me soon & in the meantime I must just scrape up a bit of patience. So very much love to you dear Father & Mother & Jobber too, whose dear little letter has just come as well as Father's earlier general letter up to March 1st.  Tell Jobber I will write to her next mail. Again much love from Your very loving daughter Olive. P.S. So sorry, haven't got Wal's photo fixed, though I have printed them.  Next time! O.L.O.
