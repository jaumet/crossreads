But all along the line on the farms, one feature that was most noticeable was the absence of men.   There were a few but they were mostly old men, or lads too young to join the Army.   The women do the Farm work now.   Some of the old farmhouses are very picturesque with their moss covered thatched roofs, some have tiled roofs and do not look nearly so nice allthough they are pretty.   Before I left Egypt I saw some of the Old hands, in the 1st Batt. but could not find out anything about Cyril Horton, except that he was killed, I was also talking to one of the men who was in the fighting at Lone Pine.   From him I learned that Jack Harris was killed instantaneously by a shell "he was in the same station" as the  I saw Alf Phillips before I left Heliopolis, to join this Unit.   I dont know whether his Regmt will come across here or not somehow I dont think they will ,  I dont know whether the weather is just the ordinary everyday article or whether it has been specially prepared for us, yesterday was a nice sunny spring day,   Today is a dull grey winter one, cold enough for snow,   Which, by the way, we saw on the hills, when coming along in the Train.    The first show that I have seen for many years.   After Egypt, the cold here is no joke one allmost gets warm "Shivering"
