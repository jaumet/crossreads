lived differently.
Tuesday, 26.I have been over to Maidstone; it was a change but------
English landscape in trim and neat, prim almost. One comes upon glades and feels the charm of quiet paths and the shadowy depths of the woods, but one is never shocked by any extravagance of beauty. One never cries out at some unexpected joy that suddenly might confront one. One seems to feel only that what one sees here one will see there. This trim hedge, so straight, so stiff, and garnered, is no different to all the others. The landscape seems almost typical of the temperament of the people. There is something suppressed, something that is built or cut to a pattern.
Thursday, 28.Went for a walk up the Barming Road, and through the hop fields now deserted, and arrived back at 6.pm to learn that Mrs. Cuckney had been. I was very disappointed. She is the decentest I have seen in Blighty. She left me some "Abdullas", an apple pie, and some books.
Friday, 29.Wrote letters morning.
Saturday, 30.A beautiful day. Mrs Cuckney rang up in morning to say she was coming. She arrived at 3.pm. and brought a Miss W. with her, and cake cigarettes and mince pies. She is very good. We had tea at Aylesford---and then a long ramble round. Arrived home at 8.15 pm. after seeing them to the off at the station. Transferred with Armitage to No. 19 Ward.
