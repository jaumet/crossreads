<p>2.  where we indulged in strawberry ices, &amp; then bought some lunch to take with us to the Ghezireh Gardens, a drive from here of about a quarter of an hour.  Small gardens they are but very gay and beautiful and we sat down on the grass under one of the trees and had our lunch and a good yarn.  Then Wal wrote you a brief note which I hope you received safely for you would be so glad of it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took two photos of him, but either the films were bad or the shop people spoiled them in the developing for the prints I have just taken off for you are cracked &amp; bad &amp; I might try &amp; get better ones before I send them home to you.  All the rest of the roll of films are pretty good but just these special two that I was anxious about are crackly looking &amp; very disappointing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am enclosing a few prints of some Rid took at Tel-el-Keber &amp; here that he wanted you to see, but I am afraid those two of Wal I shan't have time to do now before the mail closes, and anyhow I fear they are rather a failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, about our last day together.  We had a peaceful little time there in the Gardens, until about 2.30 when we had to start back to town &amp; Wal to leave me to go on out to the Aerodrome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a note from him next evening from Alexandria saying that he had got away safely as far as that, &amp; then another by the next mail saying that they were going to France, had General Birdwood &amp; other high officials and 3000 troops on the "Transylvania."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not heard anything more from him though there has not been time to hear yet, but they must have evaded all submarines by this time &amp; have reached their destination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I wrote him a long letter the other day &amp; will be constantly doing so now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Leo there has been no word yet, though there has not been time yet for a letter to come through.  Have written twice to him since he left &amp; of course</p>
