F.I go upstairs to wash & have bit. I am so weak will that I cannot do anything. I sit in chair for a couple of hours. Then come below & lie about till dinner time. No brekkie or dinner, not even a drink until 5 pm, go to bed after dinner. Better at Tea & eat a little. Headache worst in my life. Meet Jack Craven. See schools of porpoises & whales.

F.Lovely Day. We see some ships but in the distance. I rub the C.O's arm. Work all day, am booked for the voyage as Nurse. We have music in afternoon. Sea calm but nice breeze in afternoon. I have a chase over a deck chair. I am much better to-day. I go to the nether regions for ice.
