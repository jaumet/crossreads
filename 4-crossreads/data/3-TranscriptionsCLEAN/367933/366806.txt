 Dear Sec. I received a parcel which you had been good enough to send along to my troop containing 24 shirts, they could not possibly have reach us in a better time, or place, as most of the men were badly in need of shirts, as where we are it so very difficult to purchase them. 
 We are having a very easy time just at present, though the conditions which we live under are not the best. 
 Your truly G.A. Guthrie. Lieut. D Troop B Squad. 1st A.L.H. Reg.
