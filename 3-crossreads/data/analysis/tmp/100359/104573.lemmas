 Erquingham After leav Estair we strung out along the road in small parti , as we were now within rang of the German gun , and their aircraft were soar aloft watch what was go on . We arriv at a small villag Erquingham about 4.30 Everyth around show sign of the time . Tree broken off by shell fire , remain of hous and church , shell hole in the road and field at almost everi road cross , there is a small buid which contain a statu of the Virgin Mari and around this vase fill with fresh flower . Quit a number of these we saw , that had been blown to piec . While we were in Egypt it was quit a common remark to hear " How I?d long to be camp at a Pub " and here we are in this littl French Villag , actual camp in an estamin . From the window we can see the remain of the Church in Armentier , which is minus it tower . Thank to the Hun . To Day Is Mother 's Birthday Juli 9th Below us is the Bar , where Beer and wine can be obtain at a penni a glass and next to that is the kitchen , where madam , and her assist , cook us a good feed , or we can cook it ourselv if we like . There are 35 of us camp at this place and there are onli 2 women in it . And the Mob is on their best behaviour , , and if anyon forget himself and use strong languag , the rest of the crowd are "down " on him like a ton of hot brick . In the Bar Ted Grey is wash up glass and in the kitchen Harri Dauch and a few other are sit in the Bar with their leg cock upon a tabl , just as though they were run the show , we slept peac on a full stomach , in spite of the shell .
