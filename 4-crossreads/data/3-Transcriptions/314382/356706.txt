<p>Pay distributed during the afternoon by Major Mills of Strathfield, who, in conversation, asked, that when I next wrote home, his kindest regards be sent to father. As the night was a glorious one we again slept on the upper deck. We, embracing, Nick Johnston, <strike>Bob Atwill</strike>, Reg Single &amp; myself.</p>
<p>July 25th: -<br/>Upon awakening this morning I discovered that my throat was sore and that a cold had taken possession of me with vengeance. Paraded sick at 4-30 pm, and, upon being examined by Capt Kirkwood was admitted to ship's hospital with Tonsolitis and Influenza. Temperature 104&deg; when first taken. Slept poorly throughout the night but felt better in the morning.</p>
<p>July 26th: -<br/>Examined by Capt again at 10 am. Temperature considerably lower and though I was kept in bed all day, by evening I was almost OK again. Night fearfully close though beautifully mild.</p>
<p>July 21st: -<br/>Up at 10 am, discharged. The day was as glorious as one could imagine but very hot. A concert was held on the well deck and proved very successful. The ship covered 360m, which was to-date, her record day's sailing since our departure.</p>
