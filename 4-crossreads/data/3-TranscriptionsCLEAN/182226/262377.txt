  
 Tuesday 21 December, 1915 
 Put in isolation because smallpox had broken out at Gozo. 
 Pinched into Valletta without a pass. Went out to Pieta & came back to camp at about 12.30 a.m. I brought a flask of Cognac back for the boys & it was duly appreciated. 
 They are very strict here now & it took me all my time to beat the pickets.
