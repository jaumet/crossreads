Our Friends the Canadian Broad Guage operating Company No 58 received word to pack up be ready to march out of Camp at 9 am. They were very busy this morning getting ready we mingled amongst them saying Good Bye to several Boys who had been great chums while in our lines. They are very much like us in their ways habits. Their Twang amused us very much. They use the words Gard Darne very frequent Sure I Guess, when I am having a Chat with them their Twang amuses me as a rule more than the yarn they tell. All our boys like them very much we trust to meet them again.
