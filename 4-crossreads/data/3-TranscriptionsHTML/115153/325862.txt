<p>It was high church on this Sunday as the service was held within a beautifully decorated enclosure in the middle of the main hall. The Choir sung in French, and there was also a solo sung by a young man, after which the choir knelt down and chanted a prayer. <br/>When the choir stood again the priests were ushered in by a Gentleman wearing a garb something in resemblance to an admiral's uniform, and carrying in his hand in and upright position a long spear. The whole scene appeared very ceremonial; the two highest priests wore crowns on their heads, one of the priests who numbered 50 in all, had the ordinary clothes on. The choir boys wore white surplices with crimson skull caps. We looked on in deep interest at the ceremony although we could not understand it.</p>
<p>After we had left the Cathedral we walked along the banks of the Somme Canal where we saw pontoon boats used as hospital transports for wounded soldiers. By the time we were ready to leave the town it was 7 o'clock and we had 18 miles to travel back to Fleselles where we were billeted. We set out on foot and in the fact that we were "slightly intoxicated" we had to lie down on the roadside after we had gone about 2miles. After having a sleep and waking at about 11p.m. we heard a motor lorry coming through the darkness along the road, and when it came up to us we cried out and the driver stopped. We had to argue a good deal before he consented to give us a ride, when we jumped in at the back of the lorry and rode as far as Villiers-Bocage, which was only one mile from where we billeted.</p>
<p>We arrived at our Billets at 5 o'clock in the morning, and sat up until it was time to go to School.</p>
<p>During the month I was at the Signalling school at Fleselles a few deaths occurred among the French, and it seemed very strange to us as we watched the manner in which the funerals were conducted. After the service was performed in the Church, over the dead, the coffin would be borne out on a stretcher-like arrangement to the Cemetery; the priest walking in front holding an open bible before him, and the mourners, and choir boys who wore white robes, walked behind the coffin chanting prayers as they walked along.</p>
