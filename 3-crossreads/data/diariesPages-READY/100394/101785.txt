January 1
Very cold today with wind and rain In the afternoon it cleared up and we went over to Condia Village. When we arrived back in camp we got orders to be ready to move off on Monday morning. Lemnos Island from the Harbour presents a very barren appearance but really contains some very fine vine growing land. Grapes are usually cultivated to a large extent.

Nothing much happened today. Held church service this morning and nearly froze but fortunately the parson cut his sermon short. The old windmills for crushing grain present a very quaint picture as does the whole Island and inhabitants. Mudros West stretches away in a volcanic stony undulation for about two miles from the Harbour when it becomes very rough and mountainous.
