<p>2nd April Sunday 1916.</p>
<p>Sergeant Major Farnes of the Signal Troop went away yesterday to take over the 2nd Signal Troop belonging to the 2nd Brigade He had the star on his shoulder. Hot again today and the flies troublesome. Most of us carry fly whisks to keep the little pests off I have ordered a yard of mosquito netting because it is almost impossible to lay and doze during the day for the flies.</p>
<p>3rd April Monday. 1916.</p>
<p>Cloudy: Sent a parcel to I.J. today Must make a note of that in case it goes astray may come in useful. All troops were served out with the "Kitchener" Helmets, they will be an improvement on the slouch hat because the weather now is getting severe and heads must be protected.</p>
<p>Poor old Sergeant Wear the Brigade Police Sergeant died last night from double pneumonia and primarily Alcoholic poisoning  he drank something awful. Poor old "Nap" "De mortus nil nisi bonum" We "planted" him this afternoon in a lovely spot near some hills at the back of the city. A cross will be erected to his memory. It seems hard to go</p>
