We were just settl down to play when a big huski blue-jacket arriv . My partner rush up to him . Present she return to me and said " Do you mind if I do n't play with you tonight . My friend has arriv and I did n't think he was come ashor tonight " , And will you play with Aunti . Of cours I smile , and acquiesc . Aunti was a dear old soul of about 80 summer , but my word she could play Whist . The younger damsel was rather charm , and I 'm sure Lill would have pat me on the back for chang over with such good grace . Fri June 21 Still potter around at the Y.M.
