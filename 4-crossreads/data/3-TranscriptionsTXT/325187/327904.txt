[Saturday 10 June 1916]
Camped at 10 AM (Saghia) & tried to sleep till 9 at night when we saddled up for Bayud-WATER is the trouble always & we never get enough for man or beast on these stunts.Marched all night & a Rocket was seen to be fired out in the Desert to alarm the Turks.Our objective was to surround a Turks Patrol & destroy 16 of their Wells.The nights are beautiful but the days hell & before we got home "We did a PERISH" but not as bad as the 6 & 7th L.H. had.  We had an aeroplane so bombed their Camels-
