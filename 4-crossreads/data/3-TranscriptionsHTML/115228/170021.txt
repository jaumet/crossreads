<p>our artillery has absolutely outclassed &amp; outranged &quot;Jacko&#39;s&quot; &amp; this has been the chief cause of our many recent successes. Twenty of our aeroplanes bombed the enemy&#39;s transports during their retreat today.</p>
<p><u>Dec.23rd</u>:- Returned from the trenches to our horses back at Richon.</p>
<p><u>Dec 25th</u>:- Xmas Day. Has been raining spasmodically though at times very heavily during the last two days &amp; nights. Xmas gifts &amp; also many parcels have just arrived, thus we have many good things to eat as well as Richon wine to drink, had it been fine</p>
