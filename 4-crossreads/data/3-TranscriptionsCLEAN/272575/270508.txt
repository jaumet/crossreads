  
 deal of the harvesting and other farm work   Looking over your letter Bea which I have here now. You speak of a little place near Toulon I spent a night on the Troopship in Toulon harbour and I can tell you that I would have very much liked to get ashore there for a while, the hills and Trees, and the green slopes running down to the water, looked so pretty after the desert along the old Suez Canal .. and the little town nestling at the foot of the hill looked so quiet and peaceful but we were not allowed off the boat, we went on next day and landed about 4. PM got into the train about 6 AM. and did not get out again for 64 hours.    I was just about tired of that trip The Bugle is just sounding first post so I will have to get away to bed Bea So will Close with love and All Good Wishes for Xmas & New Year from Chas
