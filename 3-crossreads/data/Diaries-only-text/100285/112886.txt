4th. Last night our Mess gave a free night provided a supper, this was done out of Regimental Funds for all the Messe's have a large surplus on hand this is one of their fancy ways of reducing such handy things, Lindsay I looked in about 9 oclock but you could scarce get a foothold the place was simply crowded out nearly suffocating with smoke the stink of the spilt beer was sickening there were lots of officers there as soon as I set foot inside the door Gribble spots me tries hard to get me to have a drink with him but no good I got out of the situation by having a cigar instead it was a strong one nearly made me sick, I cant stand these strong cigars at any price, however
