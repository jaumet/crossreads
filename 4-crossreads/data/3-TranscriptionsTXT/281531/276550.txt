23/7/18PitlochtryLeft Pitlochtry by a train at 8 and got a splendid view of the Pass of Killiecrankie and the Soldiers Leap. The train commenced to climb until we got up into barren heatherclad & treeless hills. The scenery was truly wonderful. Brooks ran on both sides of the line and all down the hillsides were cascades. After crossing the summit we ran down rapidly through fine wooded glens and past lochs till we came to the little town of Aviemore. We were now in Invernesshire and then went on to another little place called Boat of Garten where we had a stay of a couple of hours. Walking through the clean little village we came to a moor all heather covered and there sat down until lunchtime plucking a few sprigs & enjoying the view.
