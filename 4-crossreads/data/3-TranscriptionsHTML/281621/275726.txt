<p>Sunday 25<br/>1st Madames cider 2nd her apples 3rd her fowls &amp; now we are having her potatoes mashed nightly. Tresbon. First snow to-day. Heavy winds &amp; rain.</p>
<p>Monday 26<br/>Quite surprisingly comes the order that we are moving tomorrow to Courcolette, five or seven kilos from Boulgne.<br/>To-day has been beautifuly fine.</p>
<p>Tuesday 27<br/>Early this morning we were on loudery fatigue in the mud &amp; rain &amp; pulling down tents, but for the move it kept fine. Marched along R.N. No 1 through Samer &amp; about 9 kilos from Boulogne we turned to the <strike>left</strike> right for a mile or so. We are now billeted in the farm building of a rather big house, in fact the best billets we have been in in France.<br/>R.N. No 1 Montrierch &ndash; Boulogne &ndash; Calais.</p>
<p>Wednesday 28<br/>Work mostly fixing up new camp. These billets are very comfortable &amp; the farm building etc are much better than any we have been in previously.<br/>The view from the hilltop is fine commanding undulating valleys including that of La Laine River. We have seen practically all that river.</p>
<p>Thursday 29<br/>A rest camp is to be opened by the ambulance &amp; tents have been erected this afternoon.<br/>An aleyed dinner tonight resulted in the potatoes not being cooled. Our cooks are up to putty.</p>
<p>Friday 30<br/>Wet today but the discomfiture was counteracted by a big mail &amp; pay</p>
<p>Dec., 1917<br/>Saturday 1<br/>Heavy wind &amp; very cold. Raining.</p>
