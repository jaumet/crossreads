<p>to all and double share for your dear old self and Dad,<br/>Believe me,<br/>I am your ever affectionate son,<br/>Clem.</p>
<p>PS Give my love to Alf, Nell and Children, and thank them for their letters and love to May and Stewart and Children.<br/>Clem.</p>
<p>and we are still going strong.</p>
<p>Returning Franks letter it is "bonzer".</p>
<p>I am sending two Turkish Notes (money) home in this letter that I got off a prisoner at Rafa.</p>
<p>I have carried them for a good while but they are getting worn out so I am chancing it and sending them to you, hope you get them.</p>
<p>They are not very valuable in Turkish money but to show how short of money they are; the notes are worth in Turkish money, the larger one about a shilling and three half-pence, and the smaller one about two-pence half-penny, but I know you will value them.</p>
<p>Tell me if you get the snaps and letter of Frank's that I send in this letter also the Turkish notes.</p>
