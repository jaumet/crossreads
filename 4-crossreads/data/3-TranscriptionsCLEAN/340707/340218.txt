12-8-19All day in bed waited on hand & foot by Brise who is making a slave of herself for me, nothing is too much no journey is too long. Food is her greatest worry what will please me most & in these day there are big food troubles
First the consumers refuse to buy then the suppliers refuse to supply Often she has long walks to get anything & all the while humping the big load she has already bought. She has a heart of gold, & that refined.
13-8-19Still in bed but making great strides towards recovery. Still the same patient & careful attention. Was ever man so carefully & thoughtfully tended I wonder A cousin arrives & stays the night
14-8-19Recovery is rapid. I do not put foot to ground. Breakfast is shared on the bed with me. Now I change rooms at night for the two girls. Tomorrow is Brises fete & she is the recipient of many flowers & letters & a Salome by Wilde.
15-8-19Fete de l'Assomption - a great day & once Napoleons day but now used by worn out city people to take a holiday into the country & owing to the rush the papers wisely comment that those who stay in the city show best sense for the struggle to get away is too much.
Save for Church services
