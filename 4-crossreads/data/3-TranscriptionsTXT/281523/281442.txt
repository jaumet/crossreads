19/8/17 Campagne & Cassell  Church parade at 11 00 by Padre Lambe was followed by a march past which went very well.  A lovely fresh sunny morning.  The trees and hedges in full leaf threw back in our ears the music of the band.  After lunch rode to Cassell with the doctor, Rodda and Jimmy Alderson.  A very pleasant trip to the old town perched on the crag as it has been since Roman days.  In all directions stretches a magnificent panorama - old Roman highways now continue as routes nationals.  The town is a mass of old grey stone houses wedged close together, slippery streets, and cobble stones.  We found the Hotel Sauvage put up our horses and dined there.  Left on the homeward journey after 9.  Searchlights were after a Taube and shrapnel flashes of anti aircraft shells bursting showed up like fireflies in the dark sky.  Altogether a most interesting day.  Received orders on return for a staff ride tomorrow and will take Rodda with me.
