 My dearest Mother. 
 It does not seem a week since I last wrote to you but it is so   &amp;  no letters from Australia for me, hope to get some this week. 
 Dorothy has been on Leave   &amp;  did the 'Trossacks" (Locks of Scotland), I did want to do them but it is too late now, even if I do get my leave but no word of it yet.
