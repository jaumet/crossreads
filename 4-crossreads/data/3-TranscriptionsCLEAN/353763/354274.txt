The row the natives make is astonishing  -  They lie around the Atria -  a fleet of barges, laden with bananas for the Sydney market  -  We are all quite well - Officers & men  -  We haven't any hardships though moans are heard now & again but that's normal among any body of men & women  -
I'm learning all I can about the Navy & navy ways - I like the N.O. &  their ways - & I think I fit into this position all right  -  If this war lasts as there is evy indication of its doing one is bound if I follow up the Submarine to see Something - sooner or later  -  We drink too  -  To the day - ['Hock - Der Tag'] !!! -  Vale  - Fred
