  
 We going to be good little boys & do what daddy says - if he wants us to coal ship, transfer cargo, launch boats, stoke fires or swim ashore & duck for the tall timber on the other side the ramp - well we're to do it & say nixsy. Fact is we've been poking borak at Fritz for being bottled up, blockaded etc . Now Fritz has got it on us good & strong & its us to sit back & [indecipherable] low. There are this evening, just 20 ships in. There is a 35 knot beauty outside & we dont want to see her. 13th / [indecipherable] Another big Frenchman, much stained & battered, just in. She looks bad - very sick. Other ships in offing. 1.30. There seems to be a sort of fleet arriving. One more of the boats that left on the 4th ran in at dinner time. She was followed by a castle boat (well filled) a mail boat and a Britisher. The latter is some ship & should be equal to any Deutcher afloat.-  a Great cruiser of the latest, light but mighty dangerous looking. Other arrivals during afternoon & evening - a Shire boat, two Cays Steamers and a big ship of the Marathon type. Three small colliers brought the total of our harbor ornaments to 31.
