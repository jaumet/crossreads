Here I am back with the Regiment, if you look at Diary about Jany 9th 1916 You may see mention of our fight here &amp; a GREEN TREE<br/>We are now camped within 300 yards of it again.  All leave cancelled owing to burning of Bedouin Village but in a few months I hope we will be embarking it has been a great disappointment to all 1914 officers &amp; their people- but Ill save money out here &amp; be able to go strait to Bronte when I do get home-<br/>I have a Doctors Certificate to say I am unfit for active service enlarged spleen but if I may not go home, cannot do nothing so here I am.</p>
