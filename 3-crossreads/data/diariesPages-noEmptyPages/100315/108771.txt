little shelters of iron and any other odds and ends about. Saw Brazenor and Jack. The General rang up and talked a bit about things on the map. The Boche strafed us heavily at intervals filling the air with smoke and explosions. Went up the line after dark. This business so far is just like manoevers. Posts and trenches dug in beautiful green untrenched meadow ? people walking round everywhere in a casual manner. No bullets or shells up forward the only sign of war being an occasional shell chucked over towards the rear. Returned to Battn. H.Q. interviewed the S.O. Q.M. and then turned in to a jolly good sleep.
