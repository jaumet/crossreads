It was all so "mysterious" in the moonlight - with the queer guide with his black face and white flowing robes - carrying an inch of candle to show us the way into pitch dark tombs. I was glad of Charlie's towering strength - when he stopped us in the temple and bargained for a big tip - C would have none of it and ordered him to lead us out without, any more to do - which he did jabbering away to himself. Then we drove home. Of course I have been jolly lucky to be taken by people I like Alma & her Cousin to these places. The next day I rested and read and on Saturday we again - the same three went to see the Citadel with its wondrous Mosque and the courtyard where the Mamelukes were murdered by Mohamet ali in 1811. We saw two other lovely mosques and drove through interesting parts of the city.
