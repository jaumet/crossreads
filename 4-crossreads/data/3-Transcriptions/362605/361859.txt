<p>We are having our April showers now &amp; all the trees are in bud &amp; the birds singing &amp; whistling like fury.  I have not been away anywhere for some days but I saw Ellis last Tuesday on His way to Glasgow where He was to go aboard ship.</p>
<p>Well, My Dear Ones, it is getting late &amp; I've been bustling around all day, so I'll have a shave &amp; get down to my little bed.</p>
<p>Cheerio, my best love</p>
