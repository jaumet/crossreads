 Frosty morning.&nbsp; Route march of about 5 miles in morning.&nbsp; Returned lame and with the most damnable pair of frost-bitten feet that one could imagine.&nbsp; All I could do to get back to the hut.&nbsp; Dinner.&nbsp; Another route march. Returned after going a few hundred yards, damned near dead.&nbsp; Stayed in at night and wrote letters.&nbsp; Intensely cold at night.

 Again cold and bitter.&nbsp; Route march again.&nbsp; Oh, these wicked marches.&nbsp; Returned sore footed again.&nbsp; After-noon, Engineers put on draft for Brightlingsea.&nbsp; Got pay.&nbsp; Spent afternoon in hut wondering what sort of place we are going to.&nbsp; Consoled in the fact that it cannot be colder or a worse picture of misery than Perham Downs.
