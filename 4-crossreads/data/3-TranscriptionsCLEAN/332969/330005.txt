It was 2 pm when we arrived & we dropped anchor & stayed until next morning at 9 am we made another start & arrived at "Marseilles." about 11.30 am the same morning. it was a fine sight coming into the harbour & we flew the old Australian flag. We pulled into the wharf & went ashore at 5 pm & marched about a mile through the city to the train where we got on board & finally left "Marseilles" at 8 p.m. the people all seemed to go mad & they cheered us all along the streets.  We seen scored of German prisioners working along  along  the streets at different places. cleaning out the gutters. We were all night in the train & were pretty well cramed in. we had a bit of a sleep We were all very pleased when it broke day-light to see what the country was like everybody seemed to be very happy our first place to call at was "Orange" our next place was Lyons where we stayed & had breakfast & its a very fine place.  of Other  We passed through some very large towns & went over some beautiful rivers & bridges
