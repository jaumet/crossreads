It is built throughout of a yellow white sandstone is said to have over 1000 rooms most of the tradesmen there are French they don't speak much English some of them none. most of the niggers speak both passably. The pyramids can be seen plainly from Heliopolis.
A pal of mine struck a native tram driver the other day. The man earned 10/- a week could keep his sister live comfortably on his pay he was a scholar new a lot about geography and was also a Christian he never used the bad language the naughty swear word but the Kaiser was a blanky - - - --.
