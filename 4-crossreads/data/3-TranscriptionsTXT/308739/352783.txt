Saturday 23 September 1916The Stunt to Mazzar seems to be a Bungled up concern, so much so that an inquiry is now being held & a number of Leading Officers of the Division appear to be complicated.  Even our Brig. got sick of the whole show & left on his own to return to Camp.  He got lost & lay under a date Palm till morning.  Some of the Brigade Officers spent the night looking for Him without success.  On returning to Camp our Regiment had no water or Feed or Rations for Men, & great difficulty was experienced in providing even Quarter Rations.There is no doubt that those in Authority are unfitted for their jobs, & new Blood must be infused into the division before good working conditions prevail.Telegram received that Serg.
