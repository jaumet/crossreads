<p>Dear Mr Minister</p>
<p>Re Lieutenant K.A. Ferguson&mdash;on receipt of your letter of the 10th August, I carefully thought over the matter &amp; I have dealt with it as you will see by the enclosed papers which I am returning to you.</p>
<p>I am a great admirer of Mr Justice Ferguson, I suppose there is no Judge on the Bench in New South Wales who enjoys a greater amount of esteem &amp; respect. I know how cut up he was at the loss of his first boy three years ago &amp; can readily understand his feelings when the other was killed a month or two ago, although under the most gallant circumstances. But I also feel that his is the pride which would be stiffened by those sort of blows, &amp; he would have difficulty in forgiving himself if his boy was kept out of the firing line in a safe job however valuable the work might be that the boy might do. That was my reason for appealing to the boy, &amp; the response is in my opinion most gratifying. It is clear that he is the son of his parents, &amp; although I do not know Mrs Ferguson personally, I understand her to be of the same mould as her husband.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you send these papers just as they are to Judge Ferguson, he will see the whole thing for himself, &amp; it will not only relieve his mind, but stimulate his pride.</p>
