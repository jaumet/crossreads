The coast of France was sighted on the 27th & all the mountains we could see far away in the distance were snow capped & very pretty they looked for the sun was shining brightly on them, the coast of France from a distance looks a most uninviting place, but as we got closer & closer to it how the scenery changed, we could see lovely parks of trees stretching far up the hillside & green fields everywhere, Spring was fast coming in on the South of France, & she was beginning to look bonzer, everyhere & there you would see an old castle perched on some rocky eminence overlooking the sea a relic of the olden days
