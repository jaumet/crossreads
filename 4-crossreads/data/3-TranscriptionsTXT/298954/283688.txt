1918Sat. 9th Nov.Wilhelm abdicates.   News received here at 11 am.   Rumoured the Heinrich von Preussen assassinated.Revolution is expected hourly - we are ready to take to the forest  immediately, should the lager be looted for food.
At 9 pm. the church bells rang & cheering was clearly audible in Brandenburg.   The guards remove their cap badges.
Sun 10thRed Flag was hoisted over the lager at 10 am, the Count being taken away.   Captn Bruce & Majah Walker were appointed our deputies to meet representatives of the new government.   We tried all possible measures to get out (at 2 p & 7.30 p) to visit the town, with no success.   The till now easily bribed guards would not let us out even with food as a bribe!
Mon. 11th.As the only means of seeing a German town in its present state of flux I attached myself to the wagon going to the post office (at 1 pm).   The streets were crammed, all pushing toward the Hauptstrasse.  It was incredible to see the Kurassier Barrack flying a Red Flag, & the Artillerie Kaserne proudly flew a red army blanket at their lofty pole!   Red army blankets are in common use as flags.
