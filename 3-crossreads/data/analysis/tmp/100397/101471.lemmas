 Tell Father to thank H H for her enquiri and convey my Best wish for Xmas New Year to the Ladi , I am not too sure where I met her , but think in town = Lys . I would not mind go over again if some of the Hd Qr . Crowd had a better idea of the Rule of fair play , I am sorri to say their Idea are all one-sid . they appeal to the men to trust them but they show the men in everi way possibl that they do not trust the men themselv , they would not grant the men who went away on Saturday ani embark leav , after the first move was cancel , a sort of half promis was given , that an effort would be made to grant leav , then they were told that in all Probabl 48 hour leav would be grant , that help to steadi some of the men , but the next thing we heard was that they would move off that same night had I been on that draft I would have set out for London right away and had a few day holiday whether they like it or not . they simpli encourag the men to take French leav . but enough of the militari , we have been have what an Englishman here told me was real Nov.ber weather , it 's a good job it was the real articl and not an Imitat , the coastal weather at home cannot compar with this , here it just know how to rain , in a dreari , monoton sort of way that keep the Place nice and wet . we have good hard road through the camp , so do not get cover in mud . That is one bless , the last coupl of day have not been too bad , in fact it was a rather nice day today no Rain
