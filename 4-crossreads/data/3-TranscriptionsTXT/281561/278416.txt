 4/3/17. The sluices of Heaven have been open for a week, but they closed yesterday and we went for a route march this morning. This country is typical of the Flanders area. Rich flat field, and roads planted with tall poplars. The farmers do not cluster in villages, as they do in the south but in scattered farm houses. Hedges enclose the fields. 5/8/17. Norman McClymont came over to see me. We went down into Ebblingham and had some diversion. A nice little town. We do the usual parades here when the weather permits, 6 hours a day. 8/8/17. Took our packs on a route march today. Was out until two oclock. Had the afternoon off.
