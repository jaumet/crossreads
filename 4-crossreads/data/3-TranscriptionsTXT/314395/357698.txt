1.  Each butter and margarine coupon represents one week's ration.  Each numbered meat coupon represents 1/4 of the week's ration and can be used only in the week to which it relates.  A coupon or coupons must be torn off by the Shop-keeper at each purchase. If the Food Office writes the name of a butter and margarine retailer at A overleaf, butter and margarine can only be bought at his shop.
2.  If the Food Office writes the name of a butcher at B overleaf uncooked butcher's meat can only be bought at that shop.
3.  In Food Control districts where butter and margarine are unrationed the butter and margarine coupons will be detached before issue and the use of the card confined to meat.
4.  This card may be used only by or for the holder.  On his ceasing to need the card it must be returned at once to the nearest Food Office or dropped in a pillar box.
Penalties for misuse:  100 or six months' imprisonment, or both.
