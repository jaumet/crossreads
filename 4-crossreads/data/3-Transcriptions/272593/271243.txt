<p>14th Sunday once more, &amp; we held a church parade in a heavy snowstorm, right alongside there is a small wood all leafless of course &amp; on the trees snow lay thick it looked very pretty with the branches bending over with their white load &amp; the flakes falling fast while in the distance could be heard the rumble of traffic on the roads, &amp; further off still the muffled roar of heavy artillery  such was the conditions peculiar for Australians<br/>which we held our church parade under, happily the padr'e cut it as short as possible no hymns or nothing so she did not last long.<br/>My platoon found the "Guard" tonight &amp; if ever there was a rag time one well this was it, we are going to have our work cut out here I</p>
