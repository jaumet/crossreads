clouds of brown smoke exactly on the "spots" where the little flashes appeared. Flash. Flash thro? the dust smoke; the little black specks unroll overhead, crack a crack the water torn into foam as the shrapnel strikes the water all round. An ear-splitting crash right on our bow a rush of bullets just along side sends the crowd on the foc'sle scampering to cover. The rifles, maxims fire ashore rises to a regular roar. The Boom of the great guns is almost incessant. The air full of the roaring of the huge projectiles fills the air. Another chapter of history is begun.
There is something so deliberate about the appearance of shells bursting in the air at a distance. The smoke appears to just unroll like a little tissue paper ball rolled tight changing to a globe of cotton wool which drifts as the wind. The hail of bullets pours down below scattering death wounds.
