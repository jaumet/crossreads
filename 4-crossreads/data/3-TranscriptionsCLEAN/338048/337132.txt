 Sunday 3rd Zeppelins reported to have been near camp early in morning. Heavy thunderstorm whilst other chaps were on church parade. Spent good time in bed. 
 Went to pictures of the Somme battle in afternoon. Owing to my sore toe I managed so that I did not have to fall in line with the others & thus got a good seat. The pictures were very instructive and one can better understand what is happening at the front. There were three showings of the pictures today so that all the chaps could see them. The show was run by the authorities here & the admission was 2d. 
 In evening attended a sacred concert in the Y.M.C.A. and witnessed a very good concert. This is the first one I have completely sat out since I have been here
