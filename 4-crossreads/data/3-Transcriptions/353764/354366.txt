<p>We have got to watch the Natives very closely as some of the Arabs were searched &amp; found to be carrying some ammunition about with them.<br/> The Light Horse were ordered out to quell a rising with the bedouins.<br/>Arrived home at 10 pm &amp; went to bed.  Have a very bad cold &amp; fancy I am getting influenza.  A lot of our fellows very bad.  It is caused by the exceptionally cold weather at night.  It is much colder than Sydney.</p>
<p>Sunday 26/12/15<br/>Nothing of any note took place.</p>
<p>Monday  Boxing Day  27/12/15<br/>Had the Day off &amp; spent the most enjoyable time since arriving here.<br/> I &amp; 2 Sgts, whose photos you will have, hired a (Garshee) for the day, &amp; went out to the Pyramids.  I have often seen them on cards etc, but I never fully realised what they were like until now.  The drive there is most beautiful, through long Avenues with Trees on each side, &amp; strange to say beautifully laid out gardens</p>
