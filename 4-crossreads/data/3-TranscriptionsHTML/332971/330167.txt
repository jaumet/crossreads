<p>Now I am coming to the best day of all.  A Sunday in an English home &amp; the first home I have been inside since leaving Aus &ndash; so you can imagine how I appreciated it.  Twas at Mrs Sydney Robjohns at Bexhill-on-sea about 90 miles South of London &ndash; Sister Reid had friends to see down there too so we started from here early in the morning.  Such restful scenery &ndash; similar to that from Plymouth.  On arriving I loved the welcome given &ndash; I simply love home life, crave for it sometimes &ndash; Yet I toil on!  I'm thinking when I return I won't care whether I wear my welcome out with all of you but I getting away from my story.  Dinner I must mention because I haven't enjoyed anything so much for ages.  Fresh salmon, New potatoes &ndash; green peas &ndash; lettuce reddishes &amp; all home grown. Also home-grown strawberries.  After dinner we sat on the lawn and didden't I drink in the deliciously fresh air with its whiffs of new mown hay.  Then came along some friends of Mr Robjohns a Mr &amp; Mrs Cottrell.  How I did enjoy the conversation I had with Mr Cottrell a great man I call him with a beautiful mind like Colonel Stawell.  He has just lost a nephew in the Dardanelles a [indecipherable] poet only 29 yrs of age &ndash; by name &ndash; Rupert Brooke.  How highly these friends spoke of our Australian and New Zealand men &ndash; how generous &amp; brave they are, I was not only in complimentry terms but straight from the heart.  Before leaving that delightful spot I had a roll in the common &ndash; in the high green grass buttercups &amp; daisies.  How perfectly charming the English hedges &ndash; padocks &amp; lanes are.</p>
