 [Transcriber's notes: The diary describes conditions and events during the South African Horse's East Africa Campaign from early 1916 to early 1917 in present-day Kenya and Tanzania. The diary describes in some detail the very bad conditions the troops experience: lack of food and water for both men and horses, and high levels of disease such as malaria and dysentery].
