Quite an array of ships Flag, Newcastle, Japs (3), Tremeadow, Bankdale, Mallina, Roddam, Withernsea &amp; Kirnwood. Boyne &amp; Lena were sent back. Roddam a most interesting ship. She is one of two survivors of the Mt. Pelee, Martinique disaster in 1901. Almost all her crew were killed or terribly burnt.<br/>Dec 12 Coaled from Tremeadow. Hizem lost three men today overboard, rigging fenders for coaling. Only two recovered. Great doings</p>
