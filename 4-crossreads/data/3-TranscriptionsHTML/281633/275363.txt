<p>There is very little doubt that the allied Troops are the foreigners mentioned.</p>
<p>12-3, Wed.<br/>18 1915 men leave our Battalion today for Australia.  Bath Parade in the morning, at one of the Mines.  The miners on arriving at the mine change their clothes. <strike>which</strike> They hang the discarded Clothing on Grapnels which are then pulled up to the roof of the Bath House and the end of the pulley chain secured by a Padlock of which the Employe retains the Key.  Women and <strike>children</strike> Boys of less than 16 years work underground.  Children under 16 <u>only</u> work 9 Hours underground.  Over 16 they work 12 above &amp; Below.  There were two women working in the lamp room and I seen other women trucking.  (I gathered the above information from the Rules pasted outside the mine office.)  Right through this country if there are any easy Jobs going the <u>men</u> get them.  The old man was much surprised when Andy mentioned that we might be sea-sick going home.  He seems to have a dim idea that it is possible to reach Aussie overland.  He has no idea of how far away it is although I have explained matters to him several times.  He knows what I say but cannot realize it.  One young chap in a middle class family here (fairly well educated too) though Australia &amp; Egypt were in England.  He actually believed that Australia was in London.</p>
<p>15-3, Saturday<br/>Gaurd today.  The Batt. has been getting very slack lately.  On the Gaurd</p>
