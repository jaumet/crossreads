 September, 1915 Sunday 12 At my request I am shifting to "El Hoyat" Convalescent Hospital Helonan &ndash; This is another immense Hotel built for Tourists, you may remember we trekked here &amp; bivouacked for 4 days last March. There are about 30 officers here &amp; the main trouble seems to be the dirty Nile water which being in flood is like the Yarra - Heliopolis water is from an Artesian Bore &ndash; Travelling shook me up a lot &amp; I'll sleep well &ndash; Got a bit of Rheumatism want of exercise I expect.
