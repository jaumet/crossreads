<p>My dear mother,</p>
<p>I have just brought a coat &amp; pair of boots that would rejoice your heart. The coat is lined with white fur, &amp; is so warm that I feel like a half-hatched egg. The boots are beauties, double-soled &amp; absolutely water tight, reaching almost up to my knees. With gloves, I am a walking puzzle &ndash; find the man.</p>
<p>I called on Miss Miles the other day. She was awfully nice &amp; offered to do all sorts of things for me. Poor Myles has been wounded again, this time, I think, seriously, though he writes very cheerfully. I am trying to find out exactly where he is as they can tell me nothing at Horseferry road.</p>
<p>Mrs Edwards has written several times</p>
