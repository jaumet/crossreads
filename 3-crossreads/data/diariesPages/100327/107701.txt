if the to speak but sentry instantly made at him with bayonet so he cleared out. Prisoners all well cared for and contented and are good workers. After tea retired early to bed. Under armed guard in rest camp are the lunatics - broken by the trenches and the sights seen there.

Up at 0630 and after breakfast with Edwards Kent to the pier. Watched floating off of pinnances and clearing up of wreckage and at 0800 found we had missed Tenedos boat and sailed on Trawler 696 for Helles hoping to catch her up there. Old skipper bluff old seadog who mellowed on being introduced to a bottle of the "cratur". Loaded up with fresh meat c. He had a dreadful time driving gale beating up and down the Gulf of Saros for three days ? out of his compliment of 92 passengers 30 had to be admitted to hospital suffering from exposure.
Passed out from Imbros past the "Swiftsure" and the "Europa" (4 funnels) and other craft looking quite busy. The island itself looking craggy and windswept the few white houses visible on exposed parts and poplar trees in the valleys. Snow still on the higher peaks. A Taube flew overhead and dropped some bombs and the air was soon full of shrapnel smoke from our antiaircraft guns. Tuomy in good form with endless jokes. 
The Peninsular showed up clearly in the lovely bright sunlight and behind were the snow capped mountains of Asia. Watched shells bursting on Hill 971 and Achi Baba and gradually drew towards Helles. The bluff going up from the beach cut into terraces on which were resting troops. Bursting shrapnel alround and spent shells and bullets splashing about in front of us. Torpedo boat destroyer passed at full speed Water calm
