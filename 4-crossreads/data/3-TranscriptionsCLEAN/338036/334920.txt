           [26th June contd]
in the messines stunt - one in particular a whizz bang gun to go to cityers [citizens?] of Parramatta.  Numerous machine guns also there.  Met Mitchell (Dave) of Thiroul & Convalescent Ward fame.  He is attached to no 1 accs now.  Had tea C.C.S.Wednesday 27 [June]Early this a Fritz plane came over & dropped a few eggs but aircraft guns & one of our airplanes put him on his way again.Thursday 28thTowards evening a very heavy thunderstorm came up and I witnessed one of the most peculiar things imaginable.  One of our balloons (captive) observing for flashed etc. was struck by a lightening flash which ripped the balloon (allowing the gas to escape) and continuing on its way down the steel hawser.  The remnants of the balloon came slowly.  To date I have not heard what happened to the occupants.  Fritz had been shelling the same balloons during the afternoon & two parachutes had left it a couple of hours previously but whether they were "dummies" or not I cannot say now.  Then down came the heaviest rain I have seen for a very long time.  By midnight it had almost fined up again.
