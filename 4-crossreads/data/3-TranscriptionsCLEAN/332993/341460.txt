  
 some the wages have increased but not much as prices. Of many others the wages have not risen at all. Accordingly, although work is not skimped, the fruit of it in terms of food & clothes is pitifully meagre. This is the principal cause of strikes. The remedy is to check the Profiteers, & increase wages to a living standard. It appears that at Ploegsteert the Germans sent over a lot of gas shells and a number of soldiers on fatigue were gassed  Some of our transport saw the bodies removed. Late this evening the Huns shelled a factory at Erquinham about a mile from here & destroyed it. Brazil has rescinded her resolution to remain neutral. 
 Tuesday June 5. 1917. This is the 1037 day of the war.  It is very hot to day  There is a lot of bombardment sent today, and the Hun aeroplanes are also very active, but are keeping very high up, appearing like specks in the sky. The French at any price meeting at Leeds was a failure last Sunday, many of the delegates were refused lodgings at the hotels, and the meeting was a very stormy one. Some of our mules are at another stable towards Erquingham, the stable was shelled, but the mules were removed in time to the roadway. I hear the huts were blown up. One of our mules at Ploegsteert was killed yesterday & another injured. No one was near them at the time.
