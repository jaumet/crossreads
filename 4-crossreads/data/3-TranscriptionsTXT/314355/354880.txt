 July 4, 5 A good play reviewed, "The Liberators" by Srguan Tucic, from The Shakespeare Head Press, 8/6.  Will write to Paris for it, Siegfried Sassoon's "Counter-Attack" circled in Heinemann's list 2/6. 
 George today, "The Oxford Book of English Verse" and in it are a number of William Blake's.  Just a glance through it, and I brought away, 
 "Summer set lip to earth's bosom bare, And left the flushed print in a poppy there". 
 T.L.S.'s review of "Resentment:  Poems" of Waugh's fair and a good summing up of his verse. 
 July 5 247. A day of no sun, a day of lovely twilight:  sitting, the sun richly stained through the curtain of cloud. 
 After tea with Capt. Laughlin to Bde. H.Q.s and a good joy ride about Borre and Caestre.  Passed on the Borre road, Blue H. moving up with Sigs. 
 July 5 On part of an old abandoned line branching from the Caestre main line, an old rust-corroded and shell marked railway engine:  its breast door open on its half hinge, facing the road, as a battered shield.  Across it, in white chalk, 
 Leave train. And a mile-stone bears, Hazebrouck, 2.5K. Bailleul, 15 K. and chalked below Sydnes, 40000000K. 
 No mail. 
 248. Read awhile George's "Oxford B. o E.V." and find I've a hundred feasts ahead.  John Donne and Ben Johnson, Wordsworth and all the "Minors", Crashaw, Herrick, and Crabbe, and Alice Meynell and Davies, and de la Mare and Johnson and Middleton, all only just tasted, with Flecker and Stephens and Yeats and the minor Irishmen. 
 Looking forward greatly to Turner's "The Dark Fire" and [indecipherable] Cross's new book with Lindsay's Illustrations. 
 Basil ringing up tonight tells of Basil Mac being made L/Cpl. at the 2nd, must write and gratulate him, he's to be inundated with notes.
