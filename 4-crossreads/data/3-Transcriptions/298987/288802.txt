<p>noticed only one dead man. This is where the advance was 4 days ago. Marched untill 4.30 &amp; were told to dig in in a railway cutting. Just got started when orders came to stop as a better place had been found about &frac14; of a mile on. It was evidently where the Infantry had dug in on the first night of the advance. Short bits of trench &amp; holes big enough for 1 or 2 men Morrison &amp; I got a piece of trench made it a bit larger &amp; covered it with iron. Came through 2 little villages today all battered up also passed a railway dump where the Huns have left a lot of stuff also a big railway gun that had been captured. It had been used for shelling Amiens. Saw 3 of our Planes  that had been brought down &amp; a damaged tank. Did not fell the march so much tonight as I had left a flannel shirt &amp; pr of sox behind to lighten the load. We all camped near Arbiners &amp; Aosiers</p>
<p>Monday 12th<br/>Were told to make our dugouts splinter</p>
