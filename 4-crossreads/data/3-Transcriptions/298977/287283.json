<p>France<br/>16th February 1917.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Richards,</p>
<p>My deepest sympathy goes out to you and all in the loss you have had through the death of your dear Son Roy.  As you know, I had known him for a considerable number of years, and the last time I saw him was in France, near the front line trenches.  It was about eight months ago.</p>
<p>We were at Hayfield, and the Sydney Grammar School at the same time.</p>
<p>One wonders when this awful business will be over.  I think and hope by the end of this year.</p>
<p>With kindest regards to you and all.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely,<br/>(Sgd) Bernard Rose</p>
