 I have been lucky so far with parcels, have received 5 all told since arriving in England.  St. James, Burwood is very good in sending them &amp; such good ones too.  I do hope you received my last letter as it was such a big one, all about my leave in London, we are hoping to get another leave before we go to France but are not sure of it yet.  We are not trying to get into a school here as it is impossible to get stripes until we have been to the front &amp; schools won't make much difference to one there.  I expect by Christmas we will be there but don't worry about us because if others have stood it we can do the same.  You were asking what were the best things to send us.  Well at present we have plenty but as soon as we move to France we will leave our kit behind &amp; only take what we wear &amp; carry our packs so you won't be able to send too many socks, mittens
