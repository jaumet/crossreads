<p>Monday 2nd<br/>Got our first war news from Mauritius, which is cheering us up a bit. The British are still doing well.</p>
<p>Saw more flying fish.</p>
<p>Tuesday 3rd<br/>The usual dreary day's doings, though livened up a bit in the afternoon by some good boxing events, our fellows all doing well.</p>
<p>Wednesday 4th<br/>Boat going along very steadily. Water just like glass though a nasty sort of day.</p>
