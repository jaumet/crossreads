  
 makeshifts till she gets right. We had 2 stampedes here the night before last. Something startled the horses, 170 of them and before anyone realised what had happened they were off, carrying head & heel lines with them. However, the men turned out like lightning and we were lucky enough to get them back on the lines with no mishaps. We hear practically no news of the outside world here except some rumours of scrapping on the Canal which I am inclined to think have some weight, especially as some of the Nurses from Mena House have been sent down there, including Sister Pocock (Howie's Friend) who came over on the Argyllshire with us. Of course all the coves here are fairly itching to be sent down there but we are not given an inkling of what part we are to play yet. Time is short for this mail so I will say good night, with best love and hoping you are both keeping quite well. Your affectate Son Terence
