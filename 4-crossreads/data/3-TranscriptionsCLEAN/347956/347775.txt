 Mon 16th Had three or four brats of various descriptions along side to-day, & Lieu. Butter from the Clan MacCorquodale came on board I believe he is going the rest of the journey with us, he told us that one of the Clan's crew went mad on the journey & one of the lads had the misfortune to have a leg broke & another broke his toe, all the rest are quite well, they have lost 13 horses up to date, we have lost 11 one died here yesterday. There is no doubt this is a lovely picture with all the New Zealand ships in at the wharves & a couple of warships amongst them, & the colors of the buildings & the green trees surrounding them seem to harmonize perfectly (On the bridge from 4 till 6 P.M.)  I have been expecting some letters here but have not got any word of mail so far
