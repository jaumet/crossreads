<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In it I saw a Bosch just coming out of his dugout, he saw me, and scuttled back, and essayed to close the iron door, I struck this door with a shot from my revolver, it was a lucky shot, a left hand shot, but it kept the door open while I hopped in and guarding the door called the Bosch to come out in my best German, he didn&#39;t come</p>
