Ellis Dave & I went to the theatre one night & saw "Gipsy Love" played.  We get grand shows now.  The theatre is run by the Army & they get the best Artists available.  We are having nearly all the good Comic opera's this Season.  How is the fruit this year.  I have had some lovely English fruit in Salisbury.  Pears Peaches & apples & also plums & Tomatoes.  All English grown & real good.  Blackberries are just beginning to ripen.  I anticipate some good feeds of them. Well Dad, I have to save some news for Mum & George, so will say au revoir this time Your Loving Son Harry.
