<p>Dear Dad<br/>I am sending along a few more things, some of interest to you others to keep for myself.  First the little purse was a Xmas present from Dick in 1914 and I have put in it a few coins, including a Turkish shilling, also a small souvenir from Ypres which I have been carrying since we first went to Belgium.</p>
<p>The little diary is one you gave me in 1914.  The metal mirror was a gift from Gnr. Wren who was killed with Cpl. Fairey at Flers.  The Post cards I purchased about 12 months ago &amp; have had in my haversack ever since.  The Photos are of some friends.  And the maps were the ones I used all through my campaigning in France, and may be useful to you in following the tide of battle.  I hope they arrive safely, as I value them all highly.</p>
<p>Your affect. Son<br/>George.</p>
