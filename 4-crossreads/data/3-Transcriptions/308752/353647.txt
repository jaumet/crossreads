<p>In the centre of the market stands a huge statue, one of the finest that I have seen in my travels. On one side of the square stands the Hotel de Ville or Town Hall, so of course, we made a visit here, and a very interesting half-hour we spent in this old &amp; historic building. On entering these places &amp; seeing the wonderful works of art contained in them one can't help thinking how clever the people were in the olden days, when all latest inventions were unknown. One room contained most beautiful paintings by Ruben, even on the ceiling fine pictures were painted. On leaving the town hall we passed through the Old Fish Market to the Church of St. Paul.  It is without a doubt, the finest Cathedral that I have ever been in. All round the walls, are statutes standing 6 ft. high entirely carved out of oak. Really a most wonderful piece of work. Our guide informed us, that these were all completed in the 14th Century by Monks. On entering the aisle, we see at the far end of it, an exquisite painting called the Seven Works of Mercy. In another portion of the church we came upon a row of 15 pictures, of the "Life of Christ". Fine paintings adorn the walls;  but those of Ruben stand out alone. Outside the cathedral is a small garden &amp; in it are some wonderful carvings in oak of the twelve Disciples,</p>
