<p>Fricourt, Mametz Wood Camp 3/11/16 tired worn out troops returning from the trenches dragging their little Lewis gun carts.  A good many Lancers were about &ndash; rather futile and useless surely.  Plenty of cavalry camps.  Disgusting to see the number of young English tommies hanging round behind the line on soft jobs.  The French will have none of this and put their old men on the light work and use the young lads for the fighting.  Switched off through a sea of mud to a camp of semicircular huts each of which holds 4 men.  Formed up on a hill until the 7th Bde got out.  The afternoon was fine and clear and the activity of aeroplanes was remarkable.  There were scores aloft all the time circling &amp; swooping.  There were also 30 to 40 balloons up both ours and the French. Heavy shells kept coming over frequently and tearing into the wood and its surrounding roads and dumps &ndash; screeching big things which sent up fountains of debris.  Saw 2 men knocked.  Thousands of troops marching and counter marching &ndash; hundreds of camps and bivouacs in the sea of mud containing hundreds of thousands of troops.  The area is packed tight with soldiers.  Reached our billet and settled down &ndash; a furious bombardment raged all throughout the latter portion of the afternoon &ndash; the whole air shaking with the reverberations of it.  At one part of the route today 4 men passed carrying a corpse on stretcher unknown nameless and going from nowhere to the same place.  Managed to get reasonably comfortable in the semicircular huts but the gluey mud everywhere was awful.</p>
