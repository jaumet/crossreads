<p>Notes on the day. 9.8.16</p>
<p>Several High Explosive shells landed very close to the Battery one landing so close that it overturned the limber. One shell landed right among the led horses of the Artillery killing about 20 horses and about 6 men I came past there shortly afterwards and they were busy with shovels burying the dead so that the Turks should not have the chance of stripping them. It seemed dreadful to think that those poor lads so full of life an hour before were now being buried under the sand and covered over and the sand scattered around<br/>But this is war.</p>
<p>Our Farrier Quarter Master Sergeant went about the scene of action fearlessly shooting the poor horses who were crippled and unfit for further service. A bullet just whizzed past my ear and buried itself in the Doctor's horse and he had to be destroyed</p>
<p>Our Commanding Officer Major Bourne has again proved that he is a capable leader; cool and resourceful under fire</p>
<p>The other officers and NCO's &amp; men were Splendid No shuffling behind led horses no scheming away on the lightest pretexts everyone willing to do his share in the great burden although facing fearful odds. The odds by the way were 10 to 1 against us. Shell after shell would burst amongst men and horses but never a budge</p>
