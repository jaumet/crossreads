 Dear Ms Bell, 
 Please accept my deepest sympathy in your sad bereavement in the loss of your dear husband. 
 I am writing to let you know the exact circumstances regarding the way your poor husband lost his life. 
 As we know he was a stretcher bearer: men who are looked on in this life as the bravest and biggest  hearted men in the army, they carry on their work of mercy under the most trying circumstances under barriages and are often sniped at by the cowardly Hun and many a comrade has your dear husband bandaged and helped to carry to a place of safety. It was after resting from one of these tours of mercy that he lost his life. 
 He was killed by a shell, It burst right in the bit of of a shelter he was resting, he suffered no pain as he was killed instantly. 
 It happened near a place called "Hangar Wood". His fellow bearers buried him and placed a neat cross up inscribed with name and number. 
 I am not going to ask you not to grieve: As I know it is only natural for us to mourn ones lost who is near and dear to us. Still I trust that in the years to come, you will be able to look back and say with pride my husband gave his life to the greatest cause the world has ever fought for. 
 His Comrade a chap by the name of Naylor was also killed by the same shell. 
 I am Yours faithfully A.E. Briscoe
