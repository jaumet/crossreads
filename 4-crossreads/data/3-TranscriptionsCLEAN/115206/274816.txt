  
 September 1918. Tuesday 3 Bty Position close to the Somme -14th A.1.Bgde. Weather fine and clear, plenty of work one way and another. Salvaging line all day for use in laying to Regt Section. Laid line to Regt Section and used all the line we salvaged. Met Jack Harvey in the evening and spent a very pleasant time. He and his colonel were the only two officers left in his Batt. The  casualties have been heavy in taking Mont St.Quentin a place that Fritz hung on to until the very last. His right of [indecipherable] is the pushing point. Rgt Section went well forward.
