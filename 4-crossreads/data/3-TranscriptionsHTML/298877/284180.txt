<p>instead of thousands of acres. just crossed the River Nile 12 45. most of the ground  around here is irrigated from the Nile.</p>
<p>Every here &amp; there one sees groups of women &amp; children shepparding little herds of mules, camels &amp; goats on these plots. The plough they use is a wooden one, same, I should think, our pioneers used in Australia, they have two Buffalos yoked to them. Just arrived in Cairo 3 P.M.  had every thing off in an hour, horses &amp; all, &amp; ready to move off to our camp, a distance of 8 miles. have to walk &amp; lead our horses. Just arrived in camp 8 P.M. &amp; jolly tired we all are. 8 miles of a walk is no joke after 6 weeks on the boat.</p>
<p>Wednesday 3rd Feb 1915.<br/>Not much sleep last night with unloading transports &amp; fixing up camp, it was pretty rotten, &amp; a dusty hole we are in too, we are camped on the same ground as the first Light Horse. they have moved out to Hele'opole.</p>
<p>Thursday 4th Feb. 1915<br/>getting settled down in our new camp now alright, the nights are very cold, the wind cuts like a knife, of course this is the middle of winter here. I am afraid our horses wont do too well here, Rye chaff we have to feed on, it is not chaff at all</p>
