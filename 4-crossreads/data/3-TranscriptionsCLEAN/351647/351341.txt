 Dear Mrs. John, 
 Expect you'll be calling me a lot of rotten names for not writing.  I have been very slack lately but I think you would forgive me if you knew what a lot I have had to do & how very cold it has been. 
 This new gag of mine is the very devil for work & all clerical & to make things most difficult we have had a cold snap of the worst for the last three weeks, snow storms & frost.  Every thing is white & really I never knew the meaning of cold before.  Several times I could have just sat down & cried with the sheer agony of it.  Fuel of any sort has been very hard to get & the supply most erratic.  I simply can't work when I am frozen & when I wasn't I simply had to go for my life at my work & had no time for letter writing.  All this sounds so rotten & feeble especially when you have been such a dear but I hope you will understand.
