<p>20th BATTALION &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5th A.I. BDE<br/>Headquarters,<br/>27th April, 1917</p>
<p>The Secretary<br/>20th Battalion Comforts Depot,<br/>63 Pitt Street.,<br/>Sydney.</p>
<p>Dear Madam,</p>
<p>I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 27th February and am glad to inform you that all the goods mentioned therein have arrived safely. They reached the Battalion during a rest after a long spell in the mud and could not have arrived at a more opportune moment.</p>
<p>Re your letter of February 16th with regard to tobacco, proceedings of the gift evening of Mrs. Moore. This has not yet arrived.</p>
<p>I would like to tell you again how useful the fund placed with Messrs. Anthony Horderns at my disposal, has been during the winter. We have been able to secure from England a regular supply of Tommy Cookers for the men who use them to heat up their food in the forward trenches where it is impossible to light fires. This has been a great benefit in keeping down sickness and keeping the men comfortable. These Tommy Cookers cost 6d. each plus carriage from England and we have been getting them at the rate of 400 a week. We have also been getting a small issue from the military authorities but without our own supply we would not have had nearly sufficient to make the men comfortable. From this fund we have also bought a certain amount of oatmeal and additional Hypodermic Syringes for the benefit of the wounded.</p>
<p>I cannot thank our Comforts Committee sufficiently for the great efforts they have expended on the Battalion, and on behalf of the Officers and Men of the Battalion I wish to convey to them our thanks for their efforts on our behalf.</p>
<p>Ralston Lieut. Col.,<br/>Commanding 20th Battalion.</p>
