 FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1919. 
 Fine &amp; hot. Lopped in Top paddock &amp; 
 Mountain, and then rode round 
 Boundary &amp; Wheelers. Cut my foot 
 a bit with the tomahawk in Mountain 
 Tickle drawing water for the bore. 
 Darby started work but his tools 
 were all done up wrong &amp; he had 
 to send one bit back again.
