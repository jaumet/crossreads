<p>Ari Burun<br/>or Anzac<br/>8.7.15.</p>
<p>&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; &ndash; Had meant to write you quite a long letter but you have no idea of our discomfort here. The heat is intense &ndash; about 88&deg; &amp; like Sydney &ndash; no cool verandah to write on &ndash; only a blanket just over ones head. The flies are the ghastly limit &ndash; give one indigestion as one has to blow &amp; bolt ones grub. I cannot grumble however as I have again been on board the "Sicilia": This time got very weak from starvation following on a weeks indigestion, owing to an issue of bread, mostly dough &ndash; &amp; getting influenza on top of that, I was sent away.</p>
<p>Have told lots of generals &amp; Col. Doctors &amp; things that if Regt; doctors were given castor oil to serve out to the [regtl?] sick &amp; then a handful of rice or arrowroot or something for 2 days rations, the leakage of men wld. not be so great. Rice, <u>15 tons</u> I'm told, has been eaten here, but divil a grain have I seen. I feel sure its all kept on the beach &amp; eaten by those responsible for sending it up to the sick.</p>
<p>However &ndash; they sent me away &amp; I got better quickly. Graham took me over from the nurse &amp; so I lived on the bridge deck. He couldn't do enough &amp; fussed "somethink awful". I eat &amp; eat &amp; eat &amp; that was the cure. Geo Onslow, Shillington &amp; lots of others off &ndash; very hard to get well once down with anything. The 4th day I was well enough to come on shore but a breeze prevented any connection &amp; so I was carried away to Mudros &ndash; the bay in Lemnos Island.</p>
<p>There I saw 2 huge navies, dozens of naval officers rushing about the harbour doing nothing, &amp; hundreds of red tabbed important staff men trying to look as if they had some thing to do ashore. I cld. write a good article on the carelessness &amp; mistakes of everything from beginning to end &amp; I'm awfully glad I went to Lemnos for I see now how the mistakes etc reach here: but must wait for a Chair &amp; table &amp; comfort.</p>
<p>I had to go off the Sicilia as she was off to Malta. On landing with 7 others I deposited my small kit bag &amp; a box of food I was taking to trooper Knox of the Vic 4 L.H. from Graham, &amp; eventually we separated &amp; I was taken <strike>by</strike> alone by a Cpl to No 1 Hosp. (Australian).</p>
<p>From outside I heard the Regtl. Sergeant arguing he couldn't</p>
