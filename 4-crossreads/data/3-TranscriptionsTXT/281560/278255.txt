 8/6/16. Marched down to Head Quarters and were inspected by a gay old joker named Brig.Gen. Foot. He told us the order about the 11th Batt is cancelled. We are greatly relieved.  Was ordered to join the 3rd Battalion. Reported to the 3rd Battalion H.Q, in the afternoon. Several officers inspected us there and put us through our paces for about an hour. We had quite an audience in the finish for I reckon we showed them what a real reinforcement company was like. Then the boys were distributed over the whole Battalion and the good old 14/3 was no more. Palmer and I were sent to 16 Platoon D. Company. It was dark when we got to the billets and there was no one about. Lay down in the straw; we got a duece of a ragging when the mob came in after the pubs shut. They wanted to know "how we came to hear about the war"; In a physical arguement I got a black eye.
