<p>We would go back to the desert and so it is.</p>
<p>2nd November 1916. <strike>Dieudar</strike>  Dueidar</p>
<p>We marched from Kantara this morning full marching order and at about 4.30 pm we came to this place. The 5th Australian Light Horse have their camp here my horse was dead tired when we got into camp and was quite content to lie down in the sand. The horses will not drink this water in the desert on account of it being brackish and if they don't drink they soon knock up. We had the some trouble with them on the last occasion. Some of them would not drink properly even after 4 months in the desert. Many of them had to be sent back to Kantara in consequence and now we are going to have the same trouble over again. The dew is very heavy here at night and the blankets get wet and at 6 oclock am they have to be rolled up and packed on the camel and they are not unrolled until night the blankets being damp the whole time with no chance of drying .<br/>We are now (12 noon) halted under a group of palms having a rest. The date season by the way has nearly finished but there are quite a good number on the trees yet</p>
