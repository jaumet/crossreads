 We descend the chateau by a steep private path used by inmates when during [indecipherable] visited here & in a few minutes are in the town. 
 We then take the high for Dampierre & the road passes several times a thicket in which the grand trees make a rustic alley though one side is hidden by a high stone wall & one knows that some rich noble has his home behind it. One is hidden by wall but when one comes to the chateau itself the wall ceases & a deep ditch takes its place & a view of grounds & cheateau is possible & it is is nothing exceptional so why the enormous 16 ft wall. 
 At Dampierre is Chauteau of Lugnes family but we do not enter as family is in residence (but see pc). The road is hot & uninteresting now. Brise finds some apples but they are sour & afterwards some pears. Road has no shelter. 
 Senlisse lies to left of hills and so path leads on till we arrive at the Vaux
