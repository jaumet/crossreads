tucked away in Soho, finishing up at Pamela at the Palace a very good show on revue lines with Lily Elsie & G.P. Huntley in the leading parts.   Bertie Adams, an Australian Girl I met here in 1914 also had a good part, she having advanced well in the profession.    Supper at [indecipherable] & missed tube so walked home, about 3 miles.   Sent a cable to Australia telling of my leave during the day.   Had lunch at the Bun House Holborn an old resort of mine of prewar days.
Wednesday 2nd January   Decided on my future movements which were to go to Glasgow tonight & return on Sunday to London after calling at Birmingham.   Sent off a telegram to Glasgow  & and wrote to Elliston then took a taxi to Bunton &so to  NottingHill for lunch then to the Matinee of "When Knights were bold" quite the funniest play I have ever seen.   I laughed till I cried & felt quite tired out when it was all over, Challener being the mirth medium at the Kingway Theatre.
