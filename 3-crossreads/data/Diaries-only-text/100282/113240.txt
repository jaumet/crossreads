here first. My spell over here has done me the world of good I feel in first class form, though I can't say as how I am looking forward to the coming winter especially November December for they are so wet cold, but who knows but that I may get a nice little Blighty get right out of it.

I got quite a little surprise this morning when I took my old platoon over for the day, when I walked out on to our parade ground all the lads cheered me it was quite genuine, they were glad to have me back after the chap who had been in charge during my absence. I had no idea they thought that much of me, for as a rule most chaps can't stand me at first, they say it takes quite a while to understand me
