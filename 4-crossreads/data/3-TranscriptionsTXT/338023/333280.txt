 for abt. three weeks. Address to me still as before &ndash; 
 379 PTE H.W.P&hellip;.(abroad) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4/9th  MG.C &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attached 3rd. Div. M.G.C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AIF  Abroad. The reason for this is that so far my number is not altered. When I get a new number I will cable it &ndash; you can then cut out the 4th/9th part of the address. Savvy? I think its pretty safe to address direct to me that way after you get this letter as I will get them quicker than if sent care of Hortons. Signallers in the M.G.C. handle the Co's mail &amp; , naturally, look after their share of it! 
 Must shut off the switch&hellip; Love from Harry.
