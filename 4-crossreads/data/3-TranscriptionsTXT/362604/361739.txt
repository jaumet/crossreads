Dear Mum,
After some very nice Hot weather & a perfect day yesterday, here it is raining & blowing as if it has been doing so for weeks.  I'm answering your letters of 27.5.18, 2/6/18, 23.6.18.
I was grieved to hear of Poor Roley Beale's misfortune.  Some have more than their share of bad luck.  Had He any children.  I can imagine Dad on Dolly's Back.  I'll bet that He soon slipped off.  Why did George not ride it up.  He has ridden Her before.  I have heard from Bess that the Party was every great success.  No doubt it aught to have been for the names of the People present would tell me that.
