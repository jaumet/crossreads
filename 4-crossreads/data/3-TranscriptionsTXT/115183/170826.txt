 (61) 14th June 1917 At 10.30am we fell in with full kit and marched from Hillside Camp down into the flat country of Northern France to the village of Doulieu a distance of about 7&frac12; miles. Here we were billeted in two large farms not used to their full extent owing to the shortage of labour. We slept on straw in the barns except on fine nights many of us slept out under the fruit trees, the night being very warm. The only trouble was mosquitoes. Of course there were plenty of frogs in the moats round the farm houses. 
 The remainder of the 9th Brigade were billeted round about and we were resting after the battle. In our unit we had very few parades and no early ones. Just near our billets was a barber's shop run by an enterprising woman and here we could get a wash for 1d and a shave for 1&frac12; d. Another experience was to have your morning paper delivered to you in your al fresco bed before rising in the morning. Some class eh!
