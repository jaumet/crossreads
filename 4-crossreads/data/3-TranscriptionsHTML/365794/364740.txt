<p>Sunday 2 December 1917<br/>Beautiful day and when off duty 5-8 went to 14 A.G.H. &amp; with Dick went to church, 1st time since St. James, T'ba (about 20th Aug.).  Pretty little church and so nice to hear the service &amp; hymns &amp; to know that one was among Australians again for love of country is very strong when one finds oneself among a strange people in a foreign land.  Poor Dick, I found his places in the prayer book and he was obliged to sit of course all the time.<br/>No. 27 is very busy these days &amp; we hear that the powers that be are very pleased with the work of the staff in general.<br/>One N.Z. boy, Robson, for op. [indecipherable] amputation after continuous saline for about 8 days.</p>
