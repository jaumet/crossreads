we shall never go into action again for I think Peace will be soon here. But one never knows what is going to happen, however I hope I will soon be paying you a visit so that sounds rather nice dont you think so Miss King. I had a most enjoyable time in England so I must settle down until I get home to dear Sunny New South.
We are just beginning to get the cold weather here so it is to be hoped we will not have to remain here for the finish of it.
Well Miss King I have no more news at present so will close with Best Wishes. Yours SincerelySergeant R. Otto2nd Btn. France
