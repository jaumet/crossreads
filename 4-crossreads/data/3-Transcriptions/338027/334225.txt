<p>Saturday, 14 August, 1915<br/>An exceptionally quiet day we just lay in our dug outs and cursed the flies, our food is splendid considering the difficulties, we are getting figs, stews, rice, rum lime juice, tobacco &amp; Cigs now quiet presentable, when the Turks retreated they left all their belongings and they have come in very useful since.  About 4 pm the enemy put about a dozen Jack Johnsons over our heads but none did any harm, the concussion is awful, every time these guns fire our aeroplanes go up and the enemy just pour shrapnel into them, but our plucky aviators seem to take no notice of them.  We have returned over a dozen men with dysentery etc &amp; what with our casualties our strength has been reduced, to-day Capt Francki took 20 men over to Monash's gully where the 1st L.H. Bde are they are relieving the 4th F.A, it has considerably weakened our strength.  There was a big fight on the extreme  left during the night.</p>
<p>Sunday, 15 August, 1915<br/>We are hearing all sorts of rumours Achi falls every day, but we have good reason to believe that there has been an important victory on our extreme left where the 4th Bde of Austs are.  Everybody is looking forward to the next division of Austs landing English officers admit that in this country they are superb the poor Tommy is a sticker but he lacks that cut &amp; come again style of the Colonial.  There are some big guns on the beach now and some beauties coming, &amp; I think Johnny Turk will soon be back in his harem.  Another rumour is to the effect that Rumania &amp; Bulgaria have joined the allies it seems too good to be true.  Our reinforcements arrived today 5th &amp; 7th only four and we are sending men back sick every day God help us if it rains heavily &amp; we are here, cholera will rage, about dusk some Turkish shrapnel located the N.Z. Machine guns &amp; killed a few, three bearers of another ambulance were killed going up to them.</p>
