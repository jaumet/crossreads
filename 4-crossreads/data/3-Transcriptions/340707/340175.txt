<p>27-6-19<br/>47<br/>To night visited Montmartre &ndash; Caf&eacute; du Neant. Here there are coffins for tables &amp; as each enters a funeral dirge is set up. Choose your coffin to right or to left [indecipherable] everything is black &amp; everyone addressed as Moribund.</p>
<p>After a while the taper which was given to you on entering dies out &amp; you are dead. The lights go out &amp; a purple ghastly light fills room from a glass tube. Pictures are then shown on wall which change before your eyes eg a picture of Messina &amp; then earthquake &amp; fire consuming the building &amp; then above the ruins Death with his scythe.</p>
<p>The dance at Bal Tabarin with the figure of all turning to skeletons. We then pass through narrow &amp; vaulted passages illuminated if at all by green ghastly lights. This passage leads into a vault where we are shown one of the audience transformed into a skelon &ndash; very well done as the face becomes very waxy &amp; ghastly before the transformation</p>
<p>Then through outer vaulted to a churchyard where the seats are all tombs &ndash; Here on the stage revels are held &ndash; a fairy strips herself all but her chemise &amp; after this we are sent out &amp; told to let the moral sink in. The only moral I could see is dont die.</p>
<p>From here Madelon &amp; I</p>
