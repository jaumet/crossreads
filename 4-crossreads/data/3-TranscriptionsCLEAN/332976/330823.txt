March 191724th.   To-day I had 6 A.S.C. "G.S" wagons & 8 Artillery "Limbers" to bring up a number of "Armstrong" huts from near Gourdicourt to D.H.Q. between here & Bappaume, where they are to be errected by the Company.The "Deaucaville" railway has not yet got up as far as this road (Bappaume Perrone Rd) but the Pioneers & pushing it forward for all they are worth & expect to have it here by to-morrow.   The weather has been very cold of late & today the temperature was down to 27.5.The daylight saving scheme started again to-night & the clocks have been put on an hour.
