and blankets for us. On receiving a reply to the effect that it was impossible to procure either, the Captain at once took the matter in hand, with the result that in a few minutes we were supplied with hot coffee and a blanket each, the Captain at the same time saying that he was sorry that better accommodation was impossible to procure.
This officer stands out as a man who always (in the line and out of it) studied the comfort and welfare of the men under him. His name I feel it a duty to mention, being certain that those who ever had the honor and pleasure of being under his command, will agree with me in voting him one of the very best, a man who everyone could approach with full assurance that he would get a fair and impartial hearing, a man who would suffer himself if thereby he could save others under him from any hard-ship a man chock full of sympathy and feeling for his fellow men, no matter what rank. We all loved this man, and were all prepared to follow him anywhere. He was a white man, and when that epithet is applied, it means that he is every inch a man. Of course as is invariably the case, he was killed on the 2nd April 1917 in the attack on Norieul, on the Somme. He led us into action that day, and studied his men up to the very moment of his untimely death.
We lost our best friend and comrade that awful day. God rest his soul. Yes! Captain L.L. Smith, of Melbourne, O.C. D Company 51st Battalion A.I.F.

will ever live in the memory as an officer and a gentleman of the first order. A man who knew no fear, strict to a degree, would stand humbug from no man. A true soldier and a MAN.
A man respected and admired by his brother officers and loved by his men, what more could one desire.
My sympathy goes out to those loved ones he left. What an awful blank his death must have caused. It seems so strange that those who we can ill afford to lose, are taken from us, while so many who really could be done without remain. Ah well!.
