We trammed out home together I was much struck 1) with the filthy dirty uncleaned streets covered with horse manure 2) the smallness and narrowness of the Central station 3) the general dinginess and want of paint round St Kilda Road and Government House.

The Prinz Ludwig had come in and all her troops were going away like ours did this morning. We found plenty of drunks aboard and left for Sydney at 5 pm running quietly down the bay. Round the pier our screws churned up much mud.
