<p>Sunday 22nd Dec.  Had breakfast of Steak &amp; chips with coffee for 47.50 centimes then went to A.S.C at station where I was extremely fortunate &amp; drew all I asked for.  Next I tried the Canteen for Cigarettes etc but found a great shortage as usual &amp; could only buy 10 pkts of smokes.  From here we went to Marcinelle, a suburb, to the Australian Red + where I managed to get some extra for our sick, such as milk, Cocoa, cigarettes etc etc.  Decided to have dinner here but first, visited a barber where I had a shave, also wash, the first of the day, then brewed some tea &amp; made a meal with some Maconichies, bread etc, after which we set off for home, calling at a Caf&eacute; for some coffee &amp; a warm up on the way, also two canteens but  could not buy any more cigarettes.  Reached home about 3.30 after a very successful trip.  Very cold all day.</p>
