<p>NOV. &nbsp; FRIDAY 24 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine but cold. I was much better &amp; was exercising horses all the morning &amp; I got my pass after dinner &amp; got a car to Salisbury. Got to London about 8 pm the train being over an hour late so I missed Poss &amp; Kieth Moses. Could not get a room at the Regents Palace so stayed at Cox&#39;s hotel for the night.</p>
