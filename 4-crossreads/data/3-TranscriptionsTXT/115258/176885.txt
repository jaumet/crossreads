 nice chap but really ought to be sent home - he is &nbsp;not strong enough for this life. It makes a persons blood boil to see the pictures of the young chaps in Australia and then see old Jim carrying on smilingly over here - and he had to have operations for double hernia and a pendicitis before he could enlist too! That Old Testament history you sent is interresting Mother. I have read it and now the whole troop is taking in turns to read it and we send pieces  of  &nbsp;out of it on the buzzer for practice so nearly know it off by heart, and it does make the places here interresting. It is very funny to hear the chaps discussing it - they will be having an argument on some place we have been to and then they will suddenly decide to look up and see how they did it in olden days - and then there will be roars of laughter - they have decided that why we had such a rough time east of the Jordan is because we did not consult a prophet before going out there. David (I think it was) did this before going out and had great successes out Amman way, so the chaps sent a message to the Q.M. asking him to indent for a prophet to be issued to the troops before next stunt. The capture of Jericho by the Israelites by walking round it seven times is also a great joke - they say they must have made such a dust that it pretty well covered up the whole town and so they captured it.
