Edinburgh
Shopped and filled in morning. Midshipman Jock Hughes Hallett came to lunch and went out in the car with us. We went out nearly as far as Peebles the road taking us through scenery very like the Highlands. Bare hills, heather covered fields bounded by stone walls. The tops of the hills brushed by the clouds and sheep and Highland cattle on the slopes. Turned down to Romans and ran back into Edinburgh passing close under the Salisbury Craigs and Arthur's Seat. The Palace of Holyrood is typically Scotch and its environs have severe uniformity also impressed on them. Dined with Jock the others and he recited after we had had music. A fine kid ? we would laugh at him in Aust. but he is the true metal.
