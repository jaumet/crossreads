We were left aboard the "Matunga" until the 14th August, when we arrived at a harbour in Dutch New Guinea, which we afterwards named, "Matunga Harbour".

We were examined and sent below in the 'tween decks with the crews of 9 other ships, men of all nationalities, 210 men all told, and I can tell you we were packed together down there.
