I am of opinion that the masses in England, "the workers", as Australians prefer to call them, have never had a fair chance to develop their political ideas & to enforce their industrial principles. Recently, organised Labour launched a political scheme designed to create a solid & enlarged party in the House of Commons, & the farmers there of borrowed largely from the Australian schemes of Systems. At the time of writing a Bill to reform the Representation of the People is before the House of Commons Imperial Parliament. This, coupled with the fact that a General Election is not far distant, warrants the anticipation assumption that Labour will be adequately represented in the next Parliament. It is impossible for Public opinion
