<p>Dear Missus,</p>
<p>I wish I knew some name to call you that would express what I want.  Mrs. Jack doesn't quite fit in somehow however.  My <u>founting</u> pen is perfectly murderous &amp; my pencil is broken &amp; of course I haven't a new pencil or a decent knife to sharpen it if I had the pencil.</p>
<p>Aussi j'ai arrive a la derniere minute a une voyage tres difficule et dangereuse (I don't think) et quand je trouve deux letters a vous ice je suis tres abandonee et je pleurez avec pourquoi?, je ne compres pas.</p>
<p>Of the foregoing paragraph please take no notice.</p>
<p>Anyhow things generally are mixed but as (after a hiatus of several weeks) I have received three letters from your very precious self I feel I must write you a line or two straight away &amp; I'm in no fit state for anything but bed.</p>
<p>We had another cold snap &amp; every thing froze</p>
