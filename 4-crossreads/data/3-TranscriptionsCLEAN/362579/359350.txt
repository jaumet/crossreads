I daresay in normal conditions we would not look at me. The Matron was very kind, sent them to where we stayed   &  ordered tea also called me, so you see I'm still the spoilt one.
We had quite a nice jolly afternoon, the garden around the Convent (where we live) is awfully pretty, so we sat on the grass   &  talked. We do miss our merry boys but hope it wont be long before we get near them.
