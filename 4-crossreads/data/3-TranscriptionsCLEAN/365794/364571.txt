  
 Tuesday 18th June 1917 [1918] 1/2 day.  Went Club 2.45 p.m., no trace of S. Laskey so went A.S. Club 4 p.m. tea then sailing on old Nile till 6 p.m. then gardens 'till sunset & so home. Cpl. Shaw very understanding to talk to & am grieved at C. Garland's blundering ways with the boys (& sisters). Everyone so nice about our leaving.  Miss Witherington says Matron & self so sorry & so say others but am not going to appeal to Col. Dawson just try it & if not a success apply for transfer.
