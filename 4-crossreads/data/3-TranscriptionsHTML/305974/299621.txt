<p>15 Thursday<br/>A very fine day.  Went on route march in morning for about 3 miles, passing through very fine country. Got paid &pound; 2 in afternoon.  Went down to the village in evening.  I notice that only one furrow plough is in use here drawn by 2 horses.  There are plenty of Tommies here, especially the Army Service Corps.</p>
<p>16 Friday<br/>A beautiful day, weather seems to be getting on the warmer side since our arrival here.  Owing to having a very sore heal I was unable to go on parade.  Walked into Tidworth in evening &amp; came back in a motor car.  Got some camera requisites.  Nearly everyone has a cold.</p>
<p>17 Saturday<br/>Inspected by Mr Andrew Fisher &amp; <strike>party</strike> Gen. Moore this morning.  Getting very good food here (its as good as at home)<br/>We are allowed 5&frac12; d a day by Australian Gov. for food.  Done some printing (Photos) in afternoon.  Played cards until bed time.</p>
<p>18 Sunday<br/>Went over to Cholderton in the morning &amp; took a few snaps.  Went on a route march to Ludgershall (a distance of 7 miles) in afternoon &amp; had quite an enjoyable time.</p>
