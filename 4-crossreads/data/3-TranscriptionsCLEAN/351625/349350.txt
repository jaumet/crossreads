  
 unforseen happens. 
 I had a letter from Frank Bailey, my old cobber that was wounded at Hill 60, he is at Weymouth waiting for a boat back home, said he will always have a stiff leg, still he is lucky to be clear of the whole game.  I am going to write to him & tell him to go & see you when he gets back if he has time, he will be able to tell you what things are like over here & he is a good straight chap so make him welcome if he does come along. 
 We have still been having good weather although the last four days it has turned a bit showery
