 Dec 29  th  &nbsp;&nbsp;We went to Steenwerck as usual for supplies - When we got back to Park we had to paint out our shamrock sign ( [  shamrock symbol]&nbsp; signifying supplies) &amp; paint shells on instead in red &amp; blue as we are forming the amunition section, much to my satisfaction - fine day but pretty cold. Frank &amp; Beachy had an argument which ended in blows &amp; then not till Beachy threw in the sponge (which I should say he was in need of at that stage in the region of his face) &nbsp;the weather got warmer in the evening
