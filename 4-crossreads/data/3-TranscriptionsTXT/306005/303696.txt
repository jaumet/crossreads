 12-1-17 Fri 12th The train pulled up at Kilo 152 at 4.30 &amp; I then had 4 miles to walk to the camp &amp; got there at 6.30 &amp; heard Johnny Law, Leece &amp; two or three other lads were killed at Rafa, the casualties for the 1st Regt was 23. Percy Treasure (Sgt) received a bad wound through the hip. It is reported that 2008  prisoners were taken &amp; the Turks suffered heavily from casualties; only Mounted Troops were fighting &amp; the Yeomanry were with us this time &amp; fought very well; I am feeling very sore on account of the rough train trip last night, every bone &amp; muscle in my body is aching. I had no sleep on the way out &amp; done nothing today. Heard today Butler, Cameron &amp; Treasure were wounded.
