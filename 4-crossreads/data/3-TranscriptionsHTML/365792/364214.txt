<p>May 11 flooded out, &amp; its run better than our Aust Detail Camps. In front is the Canadian Hosp surrounded by a low stone wall &amp; a small forest of trees &ndash; mostly elms. On the left &ndash; Canadian Conv Camp, on the right the main road &amp; a British Conv Camp, &amp; to the rear, ploughed ground &amp; several clumps of trees. The boys are playing a friendly game of cricket &amp; causing a little amusement. Occasionally the ball lobs on a tent &amp; of course the occupants do a bit of a roar &ndash; or else "duck". Two of my cobbers left today for the Destructor. Did a bit of dusting at the Canteen, &amp; then played Bobs? for a while. Went for a stroll to No 13 Hosp &amp; got a letter which arrived ye'sty from Ethel. Also visited Nap's Monument but was too late to go up top. The surrounding gardens are lovely &amp; on the way to &amp; from Hosp I had some lovely views of the ocean, &amp; the country round about. Plenty of girls knocking around.</p>
