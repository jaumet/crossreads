<p>Monday 16 October 1916<br/>A glorious day in spite of a very few drops of rain in the morning : quite cool but bright &amp; sunny. Left Arneke abt. 9.30 &amp; on horseback I branched off at Ochtezeele to have a look at the old 1116 church. Came through really magnificent fertile country of an undulating nature : mangolds &amp; beet being pulled : potatoes being ploughed out : maize being cut for cows : beans being stacked : lovely cabbages being cut : in one place wheat being thrashed, a horse on a treadmill supplying the power. The route was for a large part through lanes bounded by hedges where the hawthorn &amp; brier berries looked beautifully red, &amp; the intertwining blackberries were laden with lovely fruit which for some reason did not seem to be appreciated by the local people : not so by the soldiers! Gorgeous autumn tints shown on chestnuts &amp; certain other trees.<br/>Nearing Watten the road skirted a steep slope below which was a fairly large canal &amp; on its banks the populous town where a good deal of manufacturing seems to be done. From here we went on to Westrove, a very small townlet with scare &amp; scanty billets. A cold night.</p>
