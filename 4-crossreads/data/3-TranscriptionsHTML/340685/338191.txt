<p>We went into a little place for tea and got a big pile of cutlets, chips, and salade with a good wine for 1/3. Very excellent wine called "Mulagher" a sort of port although stronger and sweeter and we brought a bottle home for future use. To finish up we tested the beer &ndash; very good and only a penny a glass. Got home at 8.30 and went to bed. Flags were flying as it was Accession day in France. A fine sacred statue is at the entrance to the town.<br/>2.6.16 No bull ring to-day  so we had a route march to Paris Plage and back about 13 miles. Enjoyed it although felt pretty tired. Crossed the river and followed the train line into town. Fine road with dense woods on each side and near the town is various golf links tennis courts etc. Hard courts which look very fine. Numerous hotels American bars etc just outside the town. Place itself is a very popular pleasure resort and Jack Johnson trained there for his fight with Jeffries. Town is very pretty and large the houses being very pretty and harmonising colours of green white and red. The sea front has an esplanade and bathing is indulged in. We bought some cakes and wine while we were resting on the beach and it went well. Skinned my heel going back and it is pretty sore.<br/>1.6.16 An old fashioned church (Catholic) had evensong as we approached (near the railway line and we inspected it as the chimes were being rung. Holy water and incense everywhere and numberless altars and statues to the saints all with burning candles. it was very picturesque and some soldiers were worshipping there.<br/>2.6.16 Rested the afternoon and went to French in the evening. Only about 10 minutes and 30 minutes later. Very feeble.<br/>3.6.16 Rifle practise at the No 2 Bull ring to-day. First 1 shot as sighter and then 4 slow ones after which we inspected the targets. Only 25 <strike>rounds</strike> yards right up in the hills behind the main camp. Next 10 shots rapid. I finished first of my 29 men and got all my shots well grouped with a big hole in the middle. Marched back about 6 miles altogether and I could hardly limp along. Getting back about 1 o'clock. Had a bath and put some vaseline and boracic on my blisters which are rather sore. Going to French class now Men who have been here &#126; 6 months and live in England are getting 7 days leave. French ordinals and cardinals to 20 with pronunciation which was very useful.<br/>4.6.16 Church at 9.30 but I wrote letters and read instead. Only a few went out to parade and men in command were rather annoyed that so few turned up. French class at 3 P.M. when we learnt the various articles of clothing. Padre in a humorous turn of mind. Rest of day uneventful.<br/>5.6.16 Went on Sick parade and got my feet bandaged up a treat until I nearly thought I <u>was</u> sick. Rain in the morning and our bull ring crowd returned going out again at 2 and returning at 5.30. it was very windy and terribly dusty and they had a half civilised instructor and they weren't in a good mood when they came back especially as half way through tea we all had to go down for pay.</p>
