<p>morning. General Rosenthall in command of 1st Australian Division Artillery. The 102nd Howitzer Bty had a premature, killing two of their own men. This happens very often, the fuzes are very sensitive. Frosty morning, fine sunny day. Our planes about in hundreds. A bit of a stunt on this evening. It is now quiet 5-30.P.M.</p>
<p>31-1-1918<br/>Severe cold, freezing and foggy all day. Major Byrne at wagon line. Painting all vehicles. Supposed to move out in a day or two. Three ambulances at Hospital full of wounded.</p>
<p>1-2-1918<br/>Most severe cold, icicles inches long hanging from the trees, wind blowing, and branches breaking off the trees, but strange to say the ground is not frozen. We move out on the 4th and 5th inst. New Vet Sgt arrived, Sgt Bunn to go to Calias base hospital. General Anderson inspecting our lines</p>
<p>2-2-1918<br/>Fine day. Preparations for moving. Right</p>
