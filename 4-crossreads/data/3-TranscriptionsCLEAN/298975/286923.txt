It was an awful mess, with kit bags clothes etc washing about in the dirty water We are keeping close to the coast. It is straight & uninteresting. Only (Boat broken last night) lost one man in Durban owing to the Pubs being Closed. 
 Wed 18 A nice day still close to shore It has been fairly high to day. Mountains in places. Passed East London yesterday about 3 miles out.
