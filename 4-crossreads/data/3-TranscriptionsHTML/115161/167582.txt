<p>fellows who were remaining to look after the things left behind, until we should return and collect them on our having completed our &quot;engagements&quot; at the front. (Only some came back for their belongings, many weeks later.) We are handed another rug each, so that the saving of weight was really infinitesmal.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the 6th January &#39;17 we leave Buire and continue to go forward for a further eight miles to a proper military camp. The roar of the big guns is now quite distinct, and the&nbsp;sound of the smaller &quot;pieces&quot; can be plainly heard. I wonder if this noise continues all day and night.
