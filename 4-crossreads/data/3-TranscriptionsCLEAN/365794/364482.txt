  
 Thursday 22 March 1917 [21 March 1918] Again an air raid is thought likely so here I sit 7 p.m. in Connaught ward with all shutters closed & only 1/2 ward lights on.  No fear assails us evidently as it appears to be regarded as a joke all round. S. Lamb receives marching orders for Pt. Said on Saturday next & how glad she is!  When will ours come I wonder? Went S. Club 3 p.m. & arranged for motor trip to Pyramids tomorrow 6 p.m. Sister Hanly returns to Alex today.
