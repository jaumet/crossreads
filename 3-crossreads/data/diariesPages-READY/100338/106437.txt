June
The latest news from the front is that the British, French & Germans are making very heavy attacks against each other.

On Thursday June the 20th the German papers say that, the English are expecting another offensive by the Germans, and are aware of the preparations being made, but that they are not sure of what section the attack will be launched on.

If all goes well I will have my photo taken to-morrow, and if they are good I will send some home. I have a moustach now and I want a Photo of it for a souvinir.

The Germans have the prisoners from the civil prisons working about the country in gangs. There is a party of about 30 working in this factory. They are a poor miserable lot and look half starved, they are always asking us for tobacco and food.
