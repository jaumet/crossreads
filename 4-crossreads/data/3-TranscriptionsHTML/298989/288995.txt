"Niagara falls; also "fleas" Jack Lees. Divisional Order at noon gave all the new Battalion commanders right up to the 60th. After lunch walked right round the outposts with Curnow, very warm in the sun. The view from the groups of No. 1 picquet is remarkable embracing about 10 miles, - as far as the eye can see are sandhills and sand like a great sea. This group has a telescope and commands the whole scene. Observed here that the small parralel tracks thought to be caused by lizards are in reality those of black beetles whose legs lie almost flat on the sand so they can get along easily. A disposition of Providence that enables them to cover far more ground than the ordinary beetle could with its feet.</p>
