 1915 May. 25 Tue. Have been issued from Quartermaster's store with 3 prs. socks &amp; 1 pr. puttees - the first re-issue of clothing since enrolment; but at same time not exactly necessary &ndash; have plenty of togs, pretty complete outfit. Issued with khaki helmet with blue &amp;  back  black diamond shaped cloth badge on side. Seems to be an Imperial idea to do away with the slouch hat. Went in to town to-night with "Snow" Freeman for a couple of hours. On return wrote a couple of Scout letter - and then feeling snoozy&ndash;woozy Off to bed.
