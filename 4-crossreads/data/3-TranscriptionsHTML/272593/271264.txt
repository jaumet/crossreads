<p>ness, the sound of church bells always set me thinking of old times. Just as we were having our tea tonight the bugles sounded "Orderly Sergts" &amp; out we had to double,  "orders" were that we had to go round our Coy. lines &amp; warn the men that tonight at 7.30, an S.O.S. signal would go up from the "Orderly room",  at the time mentioned we had all the men out of their beds &amp; standing out on the cold duckboards, the majority were in their underpants &amp; shirts &amp; you may guess how impatiently they waited with their teeth chattering   at last after much shouting &amp; chipping off she went, but she to the amazement of all was a dud &amp; nothing doing,  how the boys swore after being dragged out of their beds for nothing</p>
