 Trench routine, carrying water, going on fatigues, etc. 
 Was in charge of a guard of three last night. The Ghurkas attached & made a slight advance. Slept in a dugout part of the night & a trench the rest. Stray bullets kept giving you a cold feeling down the small of the back, as we are right behind the fire trench & as most of the bullets go high in the night our trench gets a rough time after dark.
