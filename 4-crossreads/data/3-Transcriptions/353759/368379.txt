<p>242  Oct. 12<br/>Cleaned out the tent &ndash; not before it needed it before turning in &ndash; and for first time for some time kept awake yarning.  Says King, "Do you know Swinburne."</p>
<p>Told him I didn"t, I intended to, and had a week ago ordered a copy of his Poems and Ballads &ndash; which I didn"t intend getting.  I"m off books;  do you know that since Jake"s been working and in the tent I"ve hardly read anything:  besides I"m not game to send them home.  I"ve already sent away far too many."</p>
<p>King started to laugh:  "neither am I.  If the dad saw these" &ndash; (4 lots of his Astrological and Horoscopocial books, and about 7 or 8 Theosophical works) &ndash; "he"d wonder 'what the hell he"s up to now"" and the Mater says, "Well, well, I did think my son was a Christian", and the grandma weeps because I wasn"t a better lad.</p>
<p>King is casting V"s horoscope:  it does seem taking a mean advantage of the girl, but she asked for it.  Symbolical Poetry certainly is dangerous ground for midnight subject &ndash; and especially pieces of Brownings and Keats like the 'Confessional" 'In a Balcony", a light word and Keats passionate songs.  It"d be as well to introduce as Keith did some of Burns epitaphs.</p>
<p>The only thing is that if it naturally works to a head I"ll drop her afterwards &ndash; which I certainly don"t want to do.  She"s a jolly girl and her unsentimental manner would make her love more than I"d like to fool with.  Jake"s affair with C-n is a different thing:  and he"s of a different composition to myself, where he"d stick to her, and change her motives from merely a tent chase to perhaps an ordinary love.  Perhaps not the last because she"s certainly shewn herself in far too a doubtful light, not morally or anything idiotic like that, but in a beastly manner light.  Another thing she"s so self opinionated and yet lazy, it"d be perhaps too publick &ndash; that is she"d lose her head and boast.  J. really is rather a catch in some lights.  Anyhow V. comes on next week, and if this new offensive starting tonight continues on, we"ll all be too rushed to worry much about Passion poems &ndash; and Nina Murdoch"s 'Songs".  Though if things don"t of themselves develop as they are tending well I"ll 'eat my hat".</p>
<p>This is the most inane stuff to write, but Jake"s in love and I"ll explode if I don"t get it off my chest &ndash; and he"s the only one that could understand it &ndash; and certainly V., but, I wonder if that"s her game.  Ye Gods:  we"ll "wait and see".</p>
<p>243<br/>I wonder if V. has raised her stakes.  "Those who play with fire are the only ones who don"t get burnt" &ndash; and believe it?</p>
<p>244  Oct. 12, a.m.<br/>G.W. breaks into a minor "Hymn of 'Ate" in "Blighty" &ndash; calling the atrocity "The Surrey Boys".</p>
<p>Everyone speaks of the Anzacs,<br/>Of their wonderful brave doings long,<br/>But does anyone hear of the Surrey boys?<br/>Who were up on Suvla Bay?<br/>(A damned unhappy reference &ndash; least said of the Surrey boys there the better!)<br/>Their work was as good and dangerous<br/>Their trials and conditions as hard:<br/>But they have not been feted in London,<br/>Or cheered on the French boulevarde.<br/>No! they are working damned hard out in Egypt ("What again?")<br/>From civilisation away;<br/>In the farthest unsanitary quarters,<br/>Where the Arab himself will not stay.<br/>But Tommys the boy to be cheerful, (Naughty!  Naughty)<br/>And work like a slave night and day,<br/>And put up with sauce for a tanner,<br/>Not sure how - <u>that"s</u> Anzacs pay."</p>
<p>Its certainly as hard on the poor beggars &ndash; but they"re not as far from home.</p>
