<p>Dear Mr. Layton<br/>I am sending Mrs. Thorne to you. Asking if you could give her some assistance got behind in rent through serious illness of children &ndash; &amp; if the &pound;1 she is owing 10/- for rent &amp; 10/- for eggs principally could be paid she would be alright. Mr. Hyde knows of Mrs. Thorne</p>
<p>Yours truly<br/>E. H. Bennie</p>
