<p>the whole day, it has been very rough &amp; the big long Atlantic rollers have been swelling up with great regularity roughly about 150 yards apart &amp; our old tub has been getting a pretty rough time, &amp; giving it also, you ought to hear the remarks that have been passed about her &amp; old Billy Hughes &amp; etc.  We actually passed a ship this morning I did not think that possible the lord only knows what the pace of the other boat must be we all thought we had the slowest boat on the ocean.  Theres one thing I'm certain of, &amp; that is that this is my last big ocean trip if I know anything about it I'm pulling out for good, &amp; digging in, in "Aussie".  No more of this agony for me I've never felt so bad in all my life before &amp; I did not care a hang whether we floated or sank.  I can eat nothing but my whole system craves for fruit, that &amp; porridge are the only things I care for at present &amp;</p>
