  
 about 9 pm I generally go to bed    -  quiet steady life   -  The food is all right & we are a very contented jolly crowd  -  From all I can see & hear if our chaps get a chance they'll distinguish themselves  - 
 W'day - Sept 2  - Fine weather   -  ports open   -  Temp 75  F  -  Jolly  -  We are passing islands - bare on the W but with trees & vegetation, so far as we can judge, on the Eastern or Pacific side   - Talking last night I learnt that our oil fuel on board is worth 3000  Each torpedo 400    -  we have spare ones   -  we have a spare periscope   -  value 500  It was said the value of the ship's cargo is  10000   -  We have 1600 packets of revolver ammunition & ? 14000 cartridges  -  303 that R knows for our magazine Lee Enfield   -  we are worth capturing   -  However we are mighty well looked after & the vessel wd  -  Be sunk before we gave her up to any Germans   -  Our notion is, in case a cruiser came in sight to go for the shore for all we'r worth   -  The gunboat isn't worth much so far as fighting goes so she'd signal our Submarines & then fall back on them   -  By the way we haven't seen them since last Saty  but they're somewhere round    - All well on board  -  I report daily to the Captain - a man put his foot thro a skylight yesterday but got off light   -  Just fancy, not a word of war news since we started   -  By the way I find each torpedo when fully equipped costs close on 800  The steel part holds the machinery & propelling power   -  To its end is fixed a 'war head' - This contains the explosive & it comes into contact with a ship's side  -  A force of 400 lbs liberates its energy & tears a hole in the ship's side   - Gun Cotton is the explosive   - 
 Thursday 8 am  - We are anchored off Townsville  - The Protector alongside & the Hospital ship - Grantala is here too
