<p>But here on my arrival yesterday I discovered that my wanderings are not yet over, they have made a clearing station at Railhead &amp; I have to go over there in charge of the riding personnel.</p>
<p>I shall be glad when I get settled down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the war is still going on. As usual I completely forgot all about my birthday until it was over, this makes the fourth birthday which I have not celebrated in this country.</p>
