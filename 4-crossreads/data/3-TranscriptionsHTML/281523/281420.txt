<p>5/8/17 Campagne<br/>Sunday and a fine day.  Church parade at 10a.m. was held in the Chateau grounds and General Paton attended.  After service marched past headed by the band &ndash; rather a good turnout.  All the officers then sat for a group photograph by M'selle and we also had a few individual photographs taken as well.  She leaves for Paris tomorrow.  Stayed at home all the afternoon and had a visit from the CO.23rd Battn Brazenor.  A beautiful fine evening and walked in the grounds along the leafy paths.  Leon Barbier was in during the afternoon and had a long talk and made a translation of a story in Fantasio.  Also talked to M'selle who is bovine like her mother and will be very haggish later on.  A quiet and peaceful evening and the War seems very far away indeed.  The Band played at mess and sounded preliminarily the "Roast Beef of Old England".</p>
