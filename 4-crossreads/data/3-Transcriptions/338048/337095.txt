<p>Saturday 24th<br/>Another fine day with good swell. Buzzer in morning &amp; holiday afternoon. "Warilda" still lagging.</p>
<p>Sunday 25th<br/>Church parade in morning. "The <strike>though</strike> being dead yet speaketh" being applied to Kitchener. Communion in afternoon followed by a song service on deck. Bought bottle Fruits Salts to help while going through tropics as I was feeling a trifle peculiar.</p>
<p>We have now settled down to the routine properly and hardly look upon this as a <strike>trip</strike> voyage with a destination in mind but more as an unusual sort of life. Constant view of the other vessels also makes this portion of trip different to the first portion.</p>
<p>All lights are now prohibited on deck after dark &amp; all portholes are closed with blackened windows. Song service took place on G. troopdeck. Had a good sing and a Chaplain &amp; two Lieuts organized it until 7 pm. when they had to go to mess</p>
<p>Monday 26<br/>Another fine day, sea very calm. Debating Socy in evening when impromtu speeches were given &amp; a good time spent.</p>
<p>Tuesday 27<br/>Fine again but rather hot. One can feel it getting warmer &amp; today being close it is very noticeable. "Warilda" improving in pace.</p>
<p>Wednesday 28<br/>Very hot and clothes being discarded. <strike>Buzzer practice</strike></p>
<p>Thursday 29<br/>Awnings being put up on boat deck Heat still continuing and sleeping out just the thing.</p>
