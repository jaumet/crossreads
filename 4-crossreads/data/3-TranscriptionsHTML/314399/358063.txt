<p>Friday 7 March 1919<br/>Wrote 15 letters today. Have a job tonight. Not very strenuous tho.  Job consisted of a picquet at the top end of Rue de Paris. Everything was quiet &amp; we came home at 9.30 pm. Caught two Waacs. Rained all day.</p>
<p>Saturday 8 March 1919<br/>Bill &amp; I went into Havre. I was on duty but it consisted of going to the club &amp; writing letters. Met the Waacs &amp; went to St Addresse [Adresse] with them. Lovely afternoon after the heavy rain in the morning.</p>
