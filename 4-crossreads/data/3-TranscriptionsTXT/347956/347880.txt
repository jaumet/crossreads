Sat 6thSignalling dismounted this morning; Nelson & I received a pass out from midday & went to Maadi I expected to see Arthur Welch there; but was disappointed as I found he was with the Vetenary Corps & is camped at Mena;  I picked up Hobson & had tea with him at the Soldiers Home,  played draughts & ping pong there till it was time to catch our tram out;  on the way to the tram we picked up Cobcroft with "three sheets in the wind" & had some trouble to get him to come home with us
