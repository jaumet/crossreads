Dear Major Jarman
I am very interested in your scheme for presenting a picture of the Ghezira Cricket ground to Goseken and think the subject very suitable for "paint".
I hope to be in Cairo within 3 or 4 days from now and we could go into the matter in detail.
I certainly think that my present contract would not prohibit me from doing the job & it is only a question of time which is getting short and of health which is not too good.  However I shall see you presently.
Yours trulyG.W. Lambert
Not undertaken.
