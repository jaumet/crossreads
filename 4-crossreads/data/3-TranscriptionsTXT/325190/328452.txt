fire in one of our biscuit tins (foot square tin boxes), & the smoke it has created must surely rob it of its comfort: they seem quite happy however.The Tommy is philosophical.Yesterday evening in Rouen station I saw a truck packed full & tight with them (some 60 or so), & with the prospect of a night under such discomfort in view, they were not  pushing & busting & cursing as some of ours.  No! they sat quite still; some reading papers & some just smoking, & had such a philosophical & resigned air that our boys could not help remarking on it.
