 (Commence) Sunday 24.11.18 The Hospital ship Wandilla arrived today from Beyrout with sick & wounded.  News this day re the majority of the German high fleet having come over to Britian & surrendered to the British Admiral Beaty & of one destroyer German having struck a mine & foundered on the way over.  Well yesterday I shall call after the words the German say & said during the last 10 years or so viz. after each toast "The Day".  Well that day has come Saturday Nov. 25.11.18 & may the Day be remembered & honored by all the Allies for the next 100 years & may all the Germans in the Allied countries be sent back to Germany after the final Peace is declared.
