Tichborne.     R. 8.5.15. J.M.     A 9.5.15.6th May 1915My last letter was written on Thursday, & you should have received it on Saturday, but it was delayed this end through one of the school kiddies forgetting to post it.  Send some of your rain up.  Leo.
My dearest Father,Thank you very much for yours of 2nd to hand on Tuesday, & of 4th to hand this evening.
Rid's appointment as chaplain came as a great surprise to me   Its hard lines on Ol, but I suppose its all for the best.We had a nice steady rain here on Monday but only 42 points fell.  It will help the crops a bit but we want more to back it up, & especially to make water for the dams which are almost dry.
My leg is a bit sore still.  The stitches broke away on Tuesday, & the thing is a gaping wound now, too tender to so sew up again even if the stitches would hold.  I am taking salts nearly every day & in addition a blood-tonic, so as to give the place a chance to heal.  There is a good bit of proud flesh, which I am bluestoning.  I had bad luck with the other leg last week too; it broke out on the old sore as the result of the cultivator running over it.  I am bathing them both in lysol & H2O every night & keeping them bandaged.  It is a very busy time just now, & if I could get anyone to take my place, I certainly would, & would lie up for a while.If I find them getting worse, & beyond my control
