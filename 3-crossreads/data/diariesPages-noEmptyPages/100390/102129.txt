Dearest people at Home.
I got your parcel mitts, sox, cigarettes, all safely a few days ago. Many, many thanks for your kindness. Xmas Day here was a . Xmas night worse. Cold heavy rain. We spent in the advanced trenches muddy cold. Its warmer again now. This is a picturesque spot full of interest bullets. Id like to tell you more but cant or you wont get the letter. Don't know how long we'll be here. Anyway its better than Anzac a lot more to see, more open.
