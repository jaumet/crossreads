<p>Our permanent Four<br/>Pick any of Australian Battalions<br/>Of Sydney or Melbourne, Light Horse<br/>So I'll sing of our 8th Reinforcements<br/>And our "permanent section of course"</p>
<p>For number one place we have Rogers<br/>With pippo &amp; I two &amp; three<br/>To complete the array there is Robert H May<br/>Some class of a section you see</p>
<p>Well Ive heard of the cooks at the poor house<br/>The ones that kill most of the lodgers<br/>But not one can compere, though they all may be fair<br/>With our section chef, Francis E Rogers</p>
<p>The way this lad cooks water<br/>And onions &amp; bully &amp; rice<br/>Makes us all feel decidedly billious<br/>Though all agree that his dishes are nice.</p>
<p>At tea we discuss our position<br/>And the bad way the war has ben run<br/>For I had it first hand with Bob May to command<br/>It would soon be the end of the Hun</p>
