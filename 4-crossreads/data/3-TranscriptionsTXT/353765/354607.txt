The question here now is "Are we going to France" or not? I am inclined to think we will be there before long, but indications point both ways, understand N.Z.M.R. kit bags have been sent to England &amp; the L.H. kit bags are at Port Said. Heard that the Col. trying to get ours here. Don't want mine. Too much of a nuisance. 7th L.H. seem to be building stables.
