we have been punching through the winter months.Major Holdsworth lectured us last night on our duties in the field & by all accounts he expects us to be in France within a few months time.I went for a long ride this morning & got my column of horses mixed up in a Camel Convoy which was about 5 miles long & consequently was very late getting back.Somehow or other I have a homesick feeling on me to-night as I sit on my bunk writing this up & at the present time  I would give my whole worlly  worldly fortune to be back.  I have a fancy that all our mail is being held up whilst the troops are moving.  Such being the case I suppose everybody will naturally wonder what has become of us.The 1st & 2nd Divisions are now on the water & we will Sail if everything goes O.K. in a months time, & a happy good riddance of Egypt.Just fancy last Saturday (18/3/16) by date is the 4th month out of N.S.W.  I wonder how many more are to pass before my return.
