 Fricourt  24/11/16  Dr James received orders to leave for Rouen and Dr Springhope reported in his stead.  Slept in until late and then arose and dressed in my purple and fine linen.  A chill grey day.  Read and wrote all the morning.  Big lot of comforts for the men came to hand including a new phonograph and records.  After lunch wrote more letters for King to post in England and then set off with Colonel to walk to Pommiers Redoubt but we found it was too far away for us and returned.  Nature is restoring this country to a peaceful aspect the hellish Mametz Wood is growing a thick underbrush and green shoots are springing from every lopped tree.  A grass carpet covers the scattered shell holes.  Colonel received orders to report to Bde H.Q with his kit so I take command again. 
 25/11/16  Cold grey day with some showers.  C.O. went to Brigade.  Issued orders for a move to Dernacourt tomorrow at 10 am. Parties at work building new huts alongside others here.  68 men on sick parade this morning on the bluff stakes with the new doctor.  Sent 20 out to join up with the working parties.  In the evening the C.O gave a dinner to the officers and the "bats" served up a good turn out.  Hors d'oeuvres, soup, fowl, meat, sweets, dessert liquers &amp; cigars. A merry crowd.  Only 4 of those who left Melbne survive all the rest were new faces &ndash; rather pathetic to we old hands.  All fresh and full of enthusiasm.  From tomorrow hope to be able to send 45 men daily to Amiens on leave and to bump an increased number to England.  Much heartburning about leave &ndash; it is inadequate men never get a break in the monotony.
