<p>It is very picturesque &amp; pretty well beyond my describing. We got the news of the naval fight today &amp; of course we longing after some papers referring to it as all we hear is verbal. It is encouraging &amp; the tide appears to have turned very strongly.</p>
<p>There is an auxilary cruiser "Laconia" Transport A64 &amp; another here. Of course we are all anxious to get off &amp; we anticipate a route march this afternoon &amp; another tomorrow all day.

<p>We falled in at 1-30 p.m. for a route march. We were very glad to get ashore &amp; we had a great march (more of a walk) to a Rly station Milton Road. We first went up a small narrow Rd "Ebenezer Rd" &amp; then along a fine wide Road with electric trams (two storied).</p>
