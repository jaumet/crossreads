<p>[10th  Dec. contd]<br/>when we visited Nieppe and saw on return journey a battle that was progressing south of us, probably Estaires.  To hear the roar of numerous heavy guns to see the star shells and other shells bursting was a sight that hypnotised us for a while.  It was grand.</p>
<p>Monday 11th [Dec]<br/>Sergt Williams &amp; Geo Pickering have not been too well for some days and today they were both sent to Hospital.  Probably influenza.  Consequently I filled the position in Orderly Room and found things rather busy today.  Had my head down all day on returns,<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wages etc. and bed at 10.15.</p>
<p>Tuesday 12th<br/>Still going hard on C Section Acquittance Roll and returns but outlook better than yesterday.  By night things were pretty straight.</p>
<p><u> Ommission</u>   Yesterday was one of the clearest we have had for some time consequently air craft were active and a German nearly flew over our Baths.  Quite a number of the 'scraps' took place during morning plainly visible to us and a German machine was brought down near Armentieres.  The white of ours and black powder of enemy's was clearly marked.</p>
<p>Tuesday (contd)  Snowing rather heavily in morning but not cold.</p>
<p>Wednesday 13th<br/>Things pretty straight.</p>
