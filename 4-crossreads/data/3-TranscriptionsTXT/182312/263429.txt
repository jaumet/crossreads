long been known as "the Nursery of the Western Front" - a picnic
compared to any other bit of the line!  These are little things
which Australians at home ought to know and they should realize
that we have yet to show that we fitted to share the line with
such tried troops as the famous British Regiments and Canadians
now here in France.  Every Australian soldier who has been in
the line here (I exclude Cairo "Anzac Heroes" and the heroes from

now in the line in France, feel very strongly on.  Mind you, I
don't for one moment contend that the Australians did not do good
work on the Peninsular:  everybody knows that they fought well and
