 Up early &amp; found we were still in mid stream anchored near a French warship. 
 Paraded &amp; took a squad at physical drill. 
 Nothing else to do today. Still anchored when we came up from dinner. 
 Hospital ship just in. 
 Rumours of torpedoes outside. 
 Left at sundown just as a transport from England absolutely crammed with soldiers arrived. 
 Out of sight of land at dark.
