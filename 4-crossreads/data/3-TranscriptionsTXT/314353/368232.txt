 November 2 Wrote to Erskine Macdonald again after From an Outpost, and reminding him of the not turning up of "The Poetry Review":  the 4th issue of M.F. books, the October lot still 'missing',.. but judging from the quality of the first three batches the loss is not too terrible. 
 This afternoon with Frank D. to the Kookaburras again:  a good show and enjoyed.  Mail:  a letter from Nick, doing well, and he wondering if he'll take an offered 3 months at Boulogne:  wondering!!! 
 102. A casual remark of Hunter's and a rum toddy &ndash; oh the loveliness inspired by the following reveries of a rum toddy &ndash; sets me thinking "while the bore talketh" of a camp we held once years ago at Stanwell Park. .. Years ago or 1911, or perhaps 1912&hellip;Gerald, and Geoff and myself,&hellip; and the first night they, Fort St., and I the S.G.S. had a great row of the respective merits and standings of the two schools.  Oh God for that week again&hellip;we lived on tinn'd stuff, corn and beans and rabbit, and each of us promised three respective Mothers we'd eat of fresh meat once a day!  Once a day, and only once did we ever see fresh meat.  To keep our promise we walked to Clifton &ndash; came back through the railway tunnel &ndash; back at camp put beef steak on to boil &ndash; made for the surf, and compleately forgot our meat tea&hellip;.  when we got back a dead fire was under a dried up billy, full of burnt cindered meat&hellip;.. 
 Three Pagans loose from all customary routine of school and home, free in the bush, by a rich sensuous surf&hellip; and now Gerald's here in damned France, in the Flying Corp, Geoff about a qualified M.O., and I'm on night duty in an old operating tent &ndash; an R.I.P. for bombing raids! 
 November 3 7 a.m.  Not to be outdone by the mists and clouds, shells from midnight till now, a quiet night, and not a single dressing:  the only visitor a 26nd Batt. boy after a drink&hellip;we stood him rhum.  The day promises another full of mists and drizzle. 
 At 3.30 this morning our guns on the left opened out rather heavily, even to the guns about here:  they slackened after an hour's full going.
