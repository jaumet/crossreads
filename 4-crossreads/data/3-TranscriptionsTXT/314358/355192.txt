19Here is a high sided truck which appears empty
Let us climb and peep in.
It is full of gun barrels all damaged by bombardment of the enemy.
All this which we have seen is but part of the vast artillery wreckage suffered by us at the Front.
What of the enemy?
Theres is a hundred-fold more.
You cant look at these old warrier guns without thinking can you
Brave old guns
Yes, but nothing mortal
