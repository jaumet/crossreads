<p>well on the way to recovery.  I am in convalescent camp, and expect very soon to be discharged fit.  I will then go to a training depot for some time before rejoining the bty. in France.  Also I will be entitled to 14 days sick leave and for that reason am cabling you to send another &pound;20 to enable me to have a look around.
