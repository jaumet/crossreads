<p>Had tea at a pretty set of dining rooms named Rose Cottage and then went thro' the Gardens by the banks of Thames.  <strike>It is</strike> (One particular spot reminded me of Botanical Gardens Sydney &amp; Farm Cove.)  Thence past Hospital &amp; through Park &amp; back by same route.<br/>As my train went rather early for Camp I left Richmond at 8 p.m.  Back to Y.M.C.A.  Thence to King's Cross &amp; from there to Waterloo Stn. in time to obtain a seat in my train which left at 10.  Just before we left searchlights began to play, myriads of them &amp; very strong too and we heard that Zepps were about <strike>that</strike> and hoped we might see some fun.   But no such luck and arrived back in Camp without incident at 2.30 a.m.</p>
<p>Monday 2nd<br/>Up at 5.30 and at once all was bustle &amp; excitement as we were to shift to No. 3 Camp.  And it was a brute of a day Raining all the time.<br/>Saw by papers that there was after all some fun in London &amp; another Zepp was brought down about an hour after we left there.<br/>Going solid all morning unloading stuff at our new quarters.  Sam &amp; I are still in same Hut (No. 13 this time) No. 3 Camp.</p>
