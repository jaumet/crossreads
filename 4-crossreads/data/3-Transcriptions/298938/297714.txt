<p>Saturday 7th October<br/>Have had another week-end in London since I wrote last in this book.<br/>Saw Rushy at the School on the Monday morning and chatted with several masters, including Nixon, McNair, Hope &amp; Kingdom.<br/>Paid 7/-, the subscription for 2 years Elizabethan membership.<br/>Was not exceedingly pleased with reception which was hardly enthusiastic. Possibly because I have not risen above a Pte, or for other reasons.<br/>Since my return have worked</p>
