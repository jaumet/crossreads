<p>we may have spent quite an auspicious Xmas, however I think we shall fare better today than at any previous Xmas since I have been a &quot;soldier of the King&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Dec 26th:</u>&nbsp; The Brigade moved back 15 miles to Ashdod, had a very wet trip, &amp; country awfully boggy after the heavy rains.&nbsp; Hear the whole of the mounted troops are to move still further back to Bela to relieve the transport, during the wet season there is no likelihood of a further advance here for at least six weeks.&nbsp; The railway is now duplicated as far as Bela.&nbsp;</p>
