 Dear George, 
 Just a few lines in answer to yours of 15.4.18 & to thank you for the Photos.  You & I are alike in getting out of focus "& moved" pictures, but I guess we'll learn some day.  Milton was on my staff but He was too much of a d- nuisance to me.  I cannot be bothered with Boys.  They are always wanting a different job so I put Him on Night Duty in the finish I think.  Of course He was willing enough & you need only tell Him that.  I am glad to hear that Cyril is well & that Jimmy Randall is able to carry on.
