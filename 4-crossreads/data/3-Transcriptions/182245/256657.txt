<p>22 TUESDAY</p>
<p>Raining all morning but</p>
<p>cleared up in afternoon. I</p>
<p>lay in the hut having a</p>
<p>rest in morning &amp; cleaned</p>
<p>my saddle in afternoon. Got</p>
<p>word that no ammunition</p>
<p>was wanted tonight, &amp; every</p>
<p>body very cheerful at the</p>
<p>prospect of a good sleep.</p>
<p>Got letters from Coomoo Coomoo,</p>
<p>Father, Mary Hill &amp; Linda.</p>
