very noticeable about their horses is that they are very light in proportion, to the Australian L. Horse, they have all come from Australia, they are what we would call light Buggy or Sulky horses, of course they haven't much to carry as the average Indian I think runs from 9 stone to 10 stone. Some of the Boys went across to A. Stationary Hospital & got a lot of mail & papers, some of the Boys L.H.F.A. got a dozen letters, needless to add my luck was out. From these letters we learn that the Wondilla & Itonus were supposed to be sunk , 4 days out from W. Australia - Also  that the papers contradicted it - Also of D. Bowmans decease. Went over to A.S.H. Camp & saw Sergt Gray, F. & N. Hill & other Boys of the 15th of the 1st. - Fred was busy cooking. A lot of Motor A.S.C. marched out our S.M. Turley also left with them, needless to add we were sorry to lose him. Made a fire about 9.15 pm & made some Tea. Green tea of course - it was jolly good - & made me think of Maud & Mrs. Single, who used to always give me green tea. The Flies nearly drive one mad.
