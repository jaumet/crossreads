<p>Bier Turk started to hand over shells &amp; high explosives.  Up to this I had flattered myself that I was an authority in the makes of shells, but what we got that day capped the lot.  We got 54 casualties in &frac34; of an hour, Prof. Philpott's son one of the killed.<br/>I cleared from there as soon as it blew over and moved nearer the firing line, since then, thank God we have had no shells.  But we have had some work.  One night between 10.30 p.m. &amp; 2 a.m. I amputated six limbs &ndash; one thigh, two legs, &amp; three arms and the light supplied was a Dietz hurricane lamp!<br/>I had to operate on these poor chaps to give them a chance of life.  There was a horrible threat down on the head &amp; we could not get them evacuated.  As it was I saw them the next afternoon, they had not got off even then!  Some one will have to toe the mark over this.<br/>For the last five or six days, things have been like a picnic &ndash; but we are so much better placed.  We can get a reasonable amount of walking now.  The Ambulance is in front of a deserted farm &ndash; blackberries, thyme &amp; thistles being the staple products with a swim after</p>
