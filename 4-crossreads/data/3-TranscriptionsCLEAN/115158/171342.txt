 Jan. 31. 
 Forty-eight hours later we were actually in the floating dock in the Tyne, & about to commence eight days' leave.  The Contractors (Smiths Dock Company) took the Ship's defects in hand, whilst the ship's Company was on leave. 
 Feb. 9 
 The day following the completion of the leave, the ship was undocked & arrived the same day in the Firth of Forth.  Here our stay was a short lived one.  On our arrival we were placed at one hours notice.  It appeared that one of our mine-sweepers "Arabis" had been sunk by a flotilla of German torpedo boats in one of their "tip & run" expeditions, other minesweepers escaping in face of superior numbers of the enemy.  We were at once ordered to go out, but this order was cancelled at the last minute.  The next day, evidently things quitened down, for we were allowed to go to 4 hours notice for full speed.  This lasted for exactly two hours, when we were ordered to raise steam "with all despatch".  "Australia" was reported ready in the astoundingly short time of 1 1/4 hours for which I received the congratulations of the Captain, which I duly conveyed to the whole Engine Room department, who were entitled as much as I was for any laudatory comments

 By midnight we were well out at sea, & the following morning at 6.30 a.m. we "cleared for action"
