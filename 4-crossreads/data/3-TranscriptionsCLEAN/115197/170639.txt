  June 6th  
 Before noon our "transport" passes beetween Cape Verde & C. Verde Islands.  Unfortunately we see neither - nor have we seen land since leaving England.  The study of "English Grammar". 
 In the evening we are very happy to behold the "Southern Cross"in the sky. 
 Before turning in I have a little relaxation in the deck swimming tank.
