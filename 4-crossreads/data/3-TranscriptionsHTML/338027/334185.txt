<p>Wednesday, 26 May, 1915<br/>Dads birthday  We hear that Italy has joined [indecipherable]  [Italy joined the Allies 23 May 1915] At night all lights are exting and we are taking a different route to the usual, we are hugging the Greatian Coast through the archipelago.  The scenery is beautiful, the reason for this is that we fear that a stray submarine that supposed to be about, all the life boats are in readiness for emergency.  The artillery are making good progress especially the Indian Mtd Battery the others are just entrenched holding the position until the enemy are driven up from Cape Hellas.  Things are much more settled now and the troops are being well looked after, reinforcements keep arriving.</p>
<p>Thursday, 27 May.<br/>No land in sight all day.  This boat although a pass. steamer cannot do better than about ten knots.  We are having an easier time now as there are only dressings to do all my bad patients are doing well and on the road to recovery.  By wireless word has come that they have captured the big German siege gun that was doing so much damage at Gaba [?] Tepe.  I have one of the interpreters who is being sent back in my ward he says that the Turks are willing to surrender but are being driven into by German Officers.  All these German Off. wear dead Aust uniforms and speak good English and it is hard to find who is who.</p>
