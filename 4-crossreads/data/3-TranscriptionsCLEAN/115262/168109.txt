  
 Saturday 8 December 1917. 
 Rain eased off. Moved at 12 noon & travelled to Julius. The last 3 miles was a perfect bog & this with more rain at the time things were interesting. 
 Today we passed the railhead now at Ashdod. 
 There is a big Aerodrome at Julius. Counted over 25 planes out. Turkish engine & rolling stock are used on the railway line.
