On the 30th we had a heavy day standing about in Battle Order while Officers gave us contradictory orders. We were ordered to tie our Putties at the Bottom and today we were ordered to tie them at the top. We were walked through all the mud lying about the camps today for absolutely no reason at all kept standing in the rain also. No wonder it took us so long to starve Fritz. The only way in which we could beat him with British Leaders. I speculated in an Onoto Pen today. We had a parade this afternoon which I dodged and on top of that another after tea, which I also dodged. So far there is no information forthcoming about time of departure, leave allowance or time of return. My present ambition is to get out of this Parade toute-de-suite.
