9.000 Stokes bombs, 10,000 MILLS No. 5, 5,000 Rifle Grenades the same number of cartridges for them 24 boxes of Very lights flares numerous other small items, I am responsible for all this so you can imagine it kept me busy as the pushing parties kept on butting in loading the wrong stuff. I told a few of them off for this, the pushing party was drawn mostly from the 3rd Batt we had somewhere round about 150 of them a few of the 2nd Bde. also. It kept Starkey I pretty busy checking counting truckloads.
