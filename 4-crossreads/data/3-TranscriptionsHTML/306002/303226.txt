<p>12.7.15<br/>Mon. 12th.  This morning everyone had to put in for any shortages of any description &amp; had an inspection of gear, it is also said that "iron rations" are to be issued again this week.  I hope it means we are to advance shortly.  15 men were sent out from Steels Post this morning to shell the Turks out of their trench with bombs, only 5 returned, they got a rather warm reception &amp; never reached the Turks trenches.  The Turks artillery also played havoc this morning with the front line of trenches on Steels.  Stan has to go to Popes Post tonight on duty so Smithers &amp; I started signalling in the same old place we just got nicely settled when two shells burst right over us, the pellets fell all round us but strange to say none hit us &amp; we did not wait for the third which burst just as we got under cover.  The 11 ins. gun that has caused Steels Post so much trouble was busy again this evening (had the usual dip).</p>
