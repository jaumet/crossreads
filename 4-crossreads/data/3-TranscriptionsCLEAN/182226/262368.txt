Sunday 12 December, 1915
Took a regular fatige of sweeping down steps & turned it in again because it was too much like hard work.
Had a very fierce game of cards won 10/- & a wristlet watch making 22/- altogether.
At 2 a.m. the military police came & were going to take our names for having a light burning after "Lights Out". There was a terrible scatter in the dark. I ended up under someones bed with the police looking for me with matches but he didn't find me although he nearly fell over me.
We do lead a fast life in the Army - What?
