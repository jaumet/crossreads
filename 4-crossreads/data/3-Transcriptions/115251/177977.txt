<p>RABAUL,<br />28th September 1914:</p>
<p>To the Board,<br />Kaewieng.</p>
<p>By the terms of Capitulation of 17th September, I promised to give no resistance to the British Troops under Col. Holmes.&nbsp; It was agreed that all British subjects who were held prisoners should be released.&nbsp; I therefore request that Vice-Consul Jolley be given freedom to go wherever he may wish.</p>
