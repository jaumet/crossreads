bumps and bumpers and bumped, for King Neptune commenced his revels there on Thursday night.  Of course something unusual was expected and some of my chums were afraid to go to bed, I went and got in a couple of hours good sleep before my interruption.
   The awakening came rather suddenly when with a big bump an officer was pitched into my cabin landing on a batch of toned photos put out to dry, when he arose he looked like a moving picture show, then they tried to put him in bed with me, but I stopped that, then we all turned out on the hatch for the next move.
   Two baths were filled and in quick succession every officer was carried struggling just enough to keep the excitement up and ducked.  Some wished to be allowed to remove their pyjamas, it was permitted, but their pyjamas were placed in the water too, I found it very funny to watch the expressions as the discovery was made.  Then a fight with wet towels, pyjamas and water until the line having been passed, and thoroughly tired out, we sought our cabins for a little sleep which we could get before "reveille."
   Our quarters were in a fearful mess, but we changed the frowns of the bed and bath stewards into smiles by the use of a golden key, the hat being taken round on their behalf.  About one o'clock on Friday I was asked to take the part of Neptune's Queen in the big display on deck, so at 3.30 well, I had to do some smart work in preparing my costumes, but I think the result was good, the photos should show you.
