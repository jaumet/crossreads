<p>trunk, he declares that you can see clouds of heat rising from the contents. Although we are all complaining of the heat, we're having a jolly good time; the last day or so we have only had muster parades at which we call the roll &amp; then dismiss, or perhaps do half an hours work or so when the dismiss [indecipherable] sounds. "B Coy" is lucky enough to have one of the best parade grounds, if you can call it such. There are five parade grounds, one on either side of the promenade deck &ndash; the one on the starboard side belongs to us &ndash; one on the boat deck &amp; one on each of the well decks. We are usually fairly well off, though it is often too hot to do much work, but then on the other hand there is no room to do it in; the other parade grounds are almost impossible when there are no awnings up to <strike>pr</strike> protect them from the heat. These cannot always be left up because of the [indecipherable] strong winds we occasionally strike &amp; have already damaged several. It seems strange that so little time back we were all working our inventing [indecipherable] to discover a means of keeping warm, &amp; now we &ndash; well we just do. I'd much rather have the heat however. There was a time when I thought I liked the cold best, but those days are now over. When we left Liverpool there were very few without coughs but now things are very different. We don't yet know where we are going, but even if we did I couldn't pit it down in writing &ndash; so you are not much the looser by our ignorance.</p>
