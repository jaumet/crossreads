 Messines On F.O.P, today with Spence and Jones. Spence remained with me till 4.30 pm. Fritz shell 54 Battalion's line and Rifle Farm to the extent of 180, 5.9.  A good chap Spence who is being spoiled by "booze". Weather unsettled and visibility at times - good.  I have found a dog, a "foxic" who is a terror on rats. He has been all day with me at F.O.P. Johns has taken up his abode of love in our domicile.
