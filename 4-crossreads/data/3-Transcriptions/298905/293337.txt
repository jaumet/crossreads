<p>for they had the mail opened<br/>I should like to have a look at Amiens it is very close to here, you can see the Catherdal quite plainly, she looks a fine big town &amp; there are electric lights &amp; trams in her.<br/>Any amount of aeroplanes about here they are nearly as common as motors.  Had a good close look at one of our battleplanes yesterday, they are fine big 'planes, there is an aerodrome right close to us.<br/>Went for a stroll last night with Don Fraser &amp; Charlie Tonkin, the roads &amp; lanes are beautiful around here &amp; a pleasure to ramble about in lovely flowers &amp; creepers everywhere.  I saw the tallest peas I ever saw in my life the other day, they were easily 15 feet high, they were on sticks</p>
