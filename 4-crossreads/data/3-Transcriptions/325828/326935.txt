<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old Chatswood boy whom Ol will probably remember viz:- Lieut Lindsay Cunningham.  His younger brother Lieut:- Roy Cunningham was killed on the Peninsula.  I am jogging along alright on my present job &amp; am quite settled down to it.  I am doing everything I can in the way of looking after the Colonel and I was rewarded the other day by the old gentleman expressing the pleasure &amp; satisfaction I have been giving him.  He is a kindly man &amp; one that I would do almost anything I could for.<br/>The weather here has been very choppy lately.  Last week it was very hot &amp; quite like summer, &amp;</p>
