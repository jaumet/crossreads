1917  January
12 FRIDAY
Very Cold, with rain, snow & sleet all
day, but cleared up in evening.
I went for a bath in the morning
with the bath parade. Out
exercising horses in the afternoon
I got a horse & went into
Bailieul in evening with
Charlie Pearce to get some
things for the canteen, & some
gum boots. Heard my R.F.C.
application was not
forwarded [past? post?] D.H. Headquarters
at Larkhill.
