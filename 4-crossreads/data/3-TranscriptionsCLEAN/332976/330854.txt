  
 May 1917 7th   We resumed our work again to-day at the Chateau with our Bosches as fatigue party.   The School Started to-day & will soon be in full swing.   The weather has been very dull all day & rain is threatening. 8th.   It has been arranged that a quarter of the section is to have a holiday each day & this is my day off.   Rain started last night & continued all through the day to our disappointment.   The remainder of the section carried on with their work as usual at the Chateau.
