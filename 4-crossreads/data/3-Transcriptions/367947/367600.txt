<p>I saw Walter Barrett but he has gone to France for sure by this. He looked well &amp; was very keen on it. You might remember me to Allie.</p>
<p>Has W.K. arrived that way yet. I'm so sorry all the boys' got out of work &amp; I guess Mother had a bad time of it. Hope she is alright now. Tell Clare I haven't had a chance to see that Aunt of hers, but will do so if I get a chance. We are about 50 miles across desert from Port Said, so you see I might see her ere long.</p>
<p>Lizzie is in Adelaide. Her letters are very gloomy, and she seems very dissatisfied all round. I'm very sorry, but we're in this now till we're let out, so its about time she got that view of it. She hasn't been at all short of money in any way &amp; ought to be putting on a brighter face than her letters indicate. Young Will is evidently a boshter.</p>
<p>I got several letters from people in the Hill. One from Geo Robinson containing real spicy congratulation from Jim Hebbard. He reckons I'm right on a royal welcome from him if he ever sees me again, so that was rather cheering.</p>
