Douglas and I finished rolling the Floor and covered it with sand. Was very much surprised when Mr Opie came along and paid us the usual 5/-, I didn't expect it.
Doug and I went back after dinner and worked for an hour or so. Went into Town after Tea. It was quite gay-looking. Flags were flying everywhere. It was the King and Queen's Silver Wedding Day.
Sun July 7th
The weather continues glorious. It is about the finest spell of good weather I remember in England. Had a Bath after Break and donned clean change.
Wrote Mother during morning. After dinner wrote B.E. and told her what Mr Opie said about coming over here. Had Tea at Y.M. in Weymouth.
Mon July 8
Brought all the gear over from the Cinema to the new motor school. The floor is set fairly well. We were on Parade till about 10.45, so there was not much done before dinner. The Lecture had to be "cut-out".
I gave Mr O.P. the particulars he asked for and now I am anxiously awaiting developments.
Tues 9
Many Happy returns Mother.
Glorious day. Our floor in the Motor School is getting badly cut up.
Lecture on "Magnet". Very interesting. The Orderly Room continues to annoy us. If only they would leave us alone we could learn something at the school, but mostly our time is wasted on Parades. After Tea went into Town.
