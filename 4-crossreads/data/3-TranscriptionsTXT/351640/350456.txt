I have not Mrs. Captain Frasers or her daughters address.
Since dinner I have written several Xmas letters which I may have opportunity to post in Fremantle.  Taking time by the forelock you will say.  Is it not good to do so?  Most of my day has been occupied in an effort to grasp French pronunciation.  Some portion has been given to surgery.
Dr. Springthorp has followed my example & upon the wall of our cabin hang photos of various members of his family.  Two boys & a girl comprise his crowd, two grown up and the third at the Melbourne University.  His daughter, the eldest, has gone to England there to be married.
11-12-14. His name was Dr. Leazaar [Lazear].  It was not called from the recesses of my brain by thinking or by thumping my skull.  Dr. Ramsay said he thought he had it in a report of a Congress.  Though he could not find it himself he looked through the pages with me behind him, my eye lighted upon a name - "Eureka Leazaar!" was at once exclaimed by me.  Of all the names I have known none had I though to lose so soon from the remembering tablets of my brain.  Alas for human frailty, or should I not rather write of some human frailty, because there be some few people who never forget.
If Nan be with you tell her that Dr. Kennedy is playing deck billiards with a party of officers and nurses.  He desires me send his best wishes to all of you for the holiday season.
Many thanks Kitty, my dear, for putting so neat a cover on M.M. Joseph's gift to me.
