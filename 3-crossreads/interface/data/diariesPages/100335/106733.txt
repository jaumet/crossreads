Saturday 28th June
Since Monday last we have been going along splendid at times with a good breeze behind and a calm Sea then the Wind would change to the Port side, the ship wo rolled and pitched very little and the Ladies on board soon recovered from their Sea Sickness, and moved about their portion of the Ship (Aft). The Ship's Guard is supposed to block any soldiers except them with Wives on board from going down Aft, but the rule is generally broken and all and sundry promenade down Aft if inclined, I for one after I finish of an Evening, clean myself and go down for a chat with two married couples, the married Men are allowed to see their Wives from 6 am until 10 Pm when they must come back forward and the Women to go down into their Cabins, but I believe several sleep on Deck as it is too hot and close, in the Cabins and they are somewhat crowded. There is a Piano Aft and they all enjoy themselves playing singing, and often the Band which play's very well, gives them a Programme, sometimes in the morning, or the Afternoon, so they all fare very well. We soon lost the English Twilight, only having it one night at Sea then it soon got dark, about 8 Pm, Our Good Ship is making good headway doing on an average between 320 to 330 miles every 24 hrs. Yesterday morning at 5 am we passed the Canary Islands and this morning the West Coast of Africa came into view and we are approaching the Equator
