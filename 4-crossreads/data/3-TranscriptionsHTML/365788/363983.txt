<p>France<br/>In the Train<br/>12 Aug 16<br/>My dearest old Girl,<br/>You will no doubt long ere this have received my wire telling you I am now Lieut. F. S. Phillips, D Company First Battalion 1st Inf. Brigade 1st Aus Divn. You don't put 729 on my letters any more as I am told Officers don't have numbers. Will you ring up Trix, Nell Sherwin, Arch &amp; Miss Rossitter &amp; tell them of the change in address also the Phillips at Lindfield.<br/>If you are not well</p>
