 the &quot;chats&quot; fail to disturb our slumbers. 
 We turn out very early in the morning so as to get things and ourselves as clean as is possible.&nbsp; It is Easter Sunday.&nbsp; Very dull but not much rain, so we start to and scrape the mud off our clothes and hope the sun will shine to dry us a bit.&nbsp; Things jog along pretty well and we lay our putties out to dry also overcoats which are one mass of mud, we scrape and spend the whole day at this and retire very early, drier and far more comfortable than we have been for some time. 
 The following day is glorious, warm sun and strong wind.&nbsp; Get everything beautifully dry and clean.&nbsp; My rifle is as clean as the next fellow&#39;s and my boots polished.&nbsp; At last we feel that life is worth living, and long to get to some civilised village or town where we can give vent to our feelings. 
 We expect that now everything is dry and clean we shall in all probability continue our journey tomorrow.&nbsp; Our hearts are light and our spirits high at the prospect of perhaps a fortnight in decent surroundings, and we are quite anxious to make a move, &quot;in the right direction&quot;. 
 Turn in at about 7.a.m. [?]after spending a most satisfactory day.&nbsp; It is Easter Monday and we have really kept it up jolly well, and are very pleased with the result of our labours.&nbsp; We tell yarns and tell each other what we shall do when we get our pay in a day or so, and map out a most interesting programme.&nbsp; We only now await our rum and then we will settle ourselves for a jolly good night&#39;s rest. 
 It starts to rain but we don&#39;t mind, everything of ours is dry and clean so we laugh at the weather, and think of the other poor fellows who have to be out in it, while we are snug and warm.&nbsp; By jove we thoroughly appreciate those splendid dugouts.&nbsp; Rum issue seems a long time coming along and we want to turn over and sleep.&nbsp; Eight thirty arrives and still no rum.&nbsp; The rain comes down heavily so we think the Q.M. is waiting for it to hold up a little.
