  
 you asked.  They are lovely & especially the one of the Mountains.  I have not received any letters from our Cousin Lizzie Norman.  I am glad Lizzie (not Liz as we used to call Her in Burwood) is such a constant visitor.  We have known one another some years haven't we.  How is Nellie getting on?  Did She ever regain Her hearing?  I see Dad has conscripted Walter & Jack Moppitt for labour.  He is very fortunate at having such voluntary workers.  Give our Kind Regards to Nurse Lascelles.  I had many good times with Her.  We were both members of Miss Dunn's Dancing Class.
