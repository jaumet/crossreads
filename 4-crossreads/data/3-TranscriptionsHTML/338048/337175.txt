<p>are our greatest wants at present.</p>
<p>It is rumoured that we go to Weymouth shortly. This will be an all night place to spend our summer. We are beginning to look upon ourselves as "Six-bob a day tourists" but I suppose we will be hard training soon. So far we are having an easy time.</p>
<p>We are all in good health and doing handsomely and have so far thoroughly enjoyed myself. I hope you are all well. While you are having winter we have a glorious summer</p>
<p>With so many sights to see time for writing letters is a little limited compared with the time we had on the boat As soon as we get our mail we will have to get busy.</p>
<p>Well I must close this much now with best love &amp; wishes</p>
<p>Your loving son<br/>Sid</p>
<p>[Text in margin]<br/>P.S. I hope you got my cable which I sent on arriving here.</p>
