<p>Friday 28 December 1917<br/>"Connaught" gave its pts. a good &amp; pretty 4 p.m. tea (all paid for by C. Grant) (&pound;5-0-0) then cigars &amp; cigarettes &amp; all pts. moved to Anzac &amp; a concert given.  Such a sight of wonder.  Rows of beds, then pts. sitting or lying on pts. beds with legs, arms, heads, etc., all in bandages.</p>
