<p>Wed. 22nd May (cont.)<br/>We left the Potsdamer in a crowded troop train, packed to suffocation.</p>
<p>Passed thru' Potsdam at about 2.40 pm. our peep showing us beautiful gardens and pretentious villas but saw very little really.</p>
<p>Arrived at Brandenburg, the big military town, at 3.30 pm. &amp; by tram and road we arrived at the lager (about 6 miles out) at about 4.30 pm.</p>
<p>The lager is an old brick mill or some such structure close by the Havel in open rye country.</p>
<p>A walk down a cobbled yard odorous of soup and Russkis and I faced a new type, the Unteroffizier.</p>
<p>He is quite a different person outside our lager which is exclusively for officers.</p>
<p>I was locked in a barbed-wire enclosure with a number of filthy Russians and a few sailors "homeward"-bound from Kommando.</p>
