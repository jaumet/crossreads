These are fine looking men &amp; it will be pity to have to Condemn to death such soldiers.<br/>We have the use of the main Court House &amp; the seats etc. are crowded with Curious Egyptians come to see this trial by the British, altho' few can understand what is being said.  they seem to take great Interest.  110&deg; today.</p>
