Huge tombs of priests dust of kings
Rising beneath our careless tread
Where whistling kites swing overhead
A thousand thousand wondrous things
Huge shells that roar like railway trains
Dun smoke bursts hurling shattered men
The gasping bayonet charge, and then
Turn uniforms with dreadful stains
 
Still heaps beneath the outspread flag
The wolf like captive's pleading eye
The firing party plodding by
Quiet heads beneath a bloody rag
Wry heaps of clothes that clutch sprawl
And ghastly boys that fight for air 
 twisted mouths with eyes that stare
Blue skies sunshine over all
White naked shapes all queerly slashed
And those who see and catch the breath
And yell with rage and rush in Death
Among the rocks all leaden splashed
Huge fleets of ships that come and go
With sporting shells flung in between
And Red Cross ships with rows of green
And red lights moving to and fro. 
If I return to sit and weave
These tales, watch the homefire burn,
When I return, ? If I return
Do you believe that they'll believe.
