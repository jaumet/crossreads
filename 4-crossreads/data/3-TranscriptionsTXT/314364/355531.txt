 Anyhow this is not an "Essay on Littlemoor Camp" but a bit of a list on what happens to  me , so here goes.  If I was an Artist I may manage to make this Book amusing, as there are some quite funny things happen to me at times. Wed. Jan 1st  The new year came in wet &amp; the old year went out wet, too. This would be a good country if it had a roof in it. Things passed off very quietly. A few of the Boys came Home from Weymouth a bit merry, that was all. Early this morning a few guns banged off at [indecipherable] &amp; the church Bells rang for about an hour. To celebrate this auspicious day we had stew for dinner. Real nice stew with plenty of smelly Herbs in it. Thurs.2 Getting my things ready to go on Leave tomorrow. Did some washing yesterday, a Job I love (I don't think). Got paid &pound;2.15 magnificent sum. Had hot bath &amp; donned clean change. Thurs. Jan.2/cont) Paid 12/- for my Railway Ticket to London, which made a hole in my [indecipherable]. Borrowed a pound from Bill Beard. Fri.3. Got ticket from Furlo' Office &amp; marched to [indecipherable] Station. There were about 30 in our Party. Boarded train about 10 a.m. Arrived London (Waterloo) at 2.20 p.m.  It was quite an interesting trip, as a number of Ladies travelled up in our carriage. They evidently had not met many Australians as they evinced great interest in some of the Diggers bloodhirsty narratives. Caught Tube from Waterloo to St James Park &amp; walked from there to Horseferry Road, where we had Dinner &amp;  bought some Cigarettes  Duty Free  100 for 2/1 A bit better than paying 5 &frac12; d for 10 as we have to do from the Canteens. Another chap &amp; I booked seats at the war chest for the Alhambra Theatre to see "Bing Boys on Broadway." Then we went for a stroll round the City. Had Tea at Lyons.
