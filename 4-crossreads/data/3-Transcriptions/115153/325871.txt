The Hospital was of a very extensive character with rows upon rows of wards each holding 50 or 60 beds. At night time we were often wakened by the air-raid alarm in the Hospital, and we would always hear a buzzing noise of engines to follow, as the planes in the aerodrome which was adjacent to the Hospital, were leaving the ground to go in search into the skies for the enemy.<br/>The Anti air-craft guns would sometimes get busy, and when that happened, every man would sit up in bed with a feeling of anxiety, thinking that at any moment a bomb may be dropped on the Hospital.
