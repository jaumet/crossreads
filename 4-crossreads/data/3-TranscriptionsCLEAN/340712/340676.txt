But to return to the breakfast      three eggs, a tartine toasted(a sort of sandwich of toast), some biscuits, and a glass of red wine (vin rouge). The coffee is good at most places, every lot being freshly ground from beans. They use a small grinder,about six inches square,for the purpose.

Scarcely one in a thousand has been to Paris or any really large town where one might possibly see clear water. The only conception they have of water is that of the wells (soakage) that one finds on every farm (about 15 to 20 ft deep and 4 ft diameter) and whose water is hardly fit to wash in. It smells anything but good at anyrate. Then there are the "fdsses", a kind of deep ditch- gutter which not only run alongside of the roads but which divides OKE farm from farm, and very often paddock from paddock. It is from these that the stock are watered.(Also the water we wash in)&#149; As no attempt is made to keep them running by a proper system of drainage, the water is for the greater part always stagnant, though fairly clear. Also, the farms and cottages are mostly tiled, the rest thatched.No water whatever is caught from the roofs, they have no gutteringl You can bet we don't drink fresh water.

One is not permitted (under pain of divers severe penalties) to do anything (except when ordered) prejudicial to one's health. You would smile to see all the funny side of this life of ours.     Among the men, there is little Sullivan 5 ft 1",who works in the forge. He is the queerest little animal
