  
 I was picked out of 60th Bty & transferred to 58th Bty. We find the Artillery hard work after having such an easy time in the details, but I guess we will get used to it sooner or later. The flys are bad here you see them leave a nigger & pitch on your bread & jam & if you care to throw it away you will go hungry. I wish the heads would send us off to France as I am sick of sand & want to see the lovely green again. 
 April 2/ On picquet for 24 hrs orders to be ready to leave for Ismalia.
