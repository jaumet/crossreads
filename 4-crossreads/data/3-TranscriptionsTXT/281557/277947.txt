 Wednesday Sept 13th  Trenches: showery: plenty of "minnies" towards the house on our left also a fair few shells kicking around: no wonder the Canadians had to fall back from that trench in front: them "minnies" would catch them lovely there: got four letters this morning: 
 Thursday Sept 14th  Trenches: showery: pretty quiet all day: relieved by the 23rd at night: pretty sloppy track home: billeted in the barracks again: issued with a blanket each &amp; it is very acceptable:

 Saturday Sept 16th  Ypres: fair day: had a look round the station &amp; town again: looked through a convent: the altar in the chapel was a beauty: got a "P" of it: a fair bit of gun fire on during the last few nights: got a bosker parcel of cakes from J.B.J.
