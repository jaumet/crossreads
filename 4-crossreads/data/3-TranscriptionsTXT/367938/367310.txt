of April 25th, except when the 13th B. (NSW) dashed out a week later, dug themselves in some 30 yds ahead & after suffering 55 casualties, routed back again in the next night. There were very few British dead, including a marine or two, a N.Z. & some Australians, but the Turks were thick. Opposite C. Sqdn's position we counted 51, not all shot by us for some had been dead four weeks.
The Turks were well dressed & frequently accoutred with our water bottles, haversacks & entrenching tools. Many bombs were to be seen & I cld. have improved the arms collection out of sight. Many of their rifles had practically no woodwork left & the steel dented all over. We returned all their rifles by order, but they cant be much good to them. The dead were buried where they were, or earth thrown on them.
I could not collect curios but have a knife in a wooden sheath & a star & crescent belt buckle in the despatch box. Also took a water bottle I needed (with Turkish writing stamped on it).
The bang I got with the bullet I told you of is almost right - it broke a blood vessel & the leg is red & purple below - Nearly all of us are bruised - The noise is less than it
