 COURT OF INQUIRY, Tuesday, 27th June, 1916 
 APPLICATION BY MR. PENNY:- 
 Since the conclusion of Friday's inquiry through the courtesy of Major Griffiths I was allowed to interview the South Australian internees in the theatre. I questioned many of them and selected certain witnesses whom I deemed necessary to produce before the Inquiry. I learn that on Sunday at a meeting among themselves five other internees were desirous of attending the Inquiry as well as Emde, and I was to make that application to you this morning, and I do so as it is made to me. Personally, I have only recognised Emde as entitled to be present, but I am in the hands of the Court on this matter. 
 REPLY BY THE COURT:- 
 Emde has conducted this inquiry on behalf of the German internees from its commencement. The Court recognised the necessity of having someone to represent so large a body of complaints and Emde was the person selected and recognised as their representative. He has conducted the case up to the time the counsel appeared with skill, and now the Court has the advantage of Counsel to assist them, couple with the instructions that he is received from Emde, who has had knowledge of this Inquiry from the commencement, the Court is of the opinion that no purpose will be served by permitting any other representative at this stage.
