 We start off again at about 12.30 after have had a spell for an hour and a half . The Band struck up again and we start off to Moaska , about 8 or 9 mile away up to this time we had fair solid ground to march on but now we got into the loos sand and it was jolli hard work plod on , over the boot top in the soft sand and the sun pour on us . We scatter out across the desert in squad , do the best we could with our limit suppli of water . Some of the poor beggar were quit deliri . One chap we came across a Sergeant kept sing out for his mother , he had torn almost all his cloth off and was roll about in the sand . We pick him up and almost carri him for about 2 mile when we came across a corpor of the same Compani , so we left him in his care and made the best of our way into camp , as our water bottl were empti and we could do no good , besid be almost beat ourselv . Billi May and Stan Wright carri the pack of some of the fellow for a consider distanc , but were mighti glad to drop them again . It was piti to see the hundr , or I might say thousand of men lie about 27 . in all attitud , all sing out for water , and we had n't a drop to give them , some of them had erect shelter by fix their bayonet on their rifl , stick them in the ground and tie their waterproof sheet to them . Out of 5 thousand men who left Moama that morn onli 300 or 400 manag to last out the distanc , the remaind be scatter over the desert .
