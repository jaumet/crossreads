<p>Tuesday 4 December 1917.</p>
<p>Got to our position at <s>2 pm</s> 2 am.</p>
<p>Casualties as result of our raid arriving at ambulance. 40 wounded &amp; 2 killed out of 120 Officers N.C.O&#39;s &amp; men. Raid not too successful.</p>
<p>Shelled again today. 1 camel killed in our unit. 6 from other units.</p>
<p>Word of being relieved tonight or in early morning. A certain plan adopted to evade suspicion from enemy observation posts. Successful.</p>
<p>At midnight the NZ&#39;s relieved us &amp; Jacko apparently knew nothing of this as not a shell was fired.</p>
