<p>Not so many patients this morning.  Still no letters.  Have received one from [indecipherable] since leaving Brisbane.</p>

He simply hates his job. Had no initiation on board.</p>
<p>Heard that we may expect to leave for front in a very short time now.  Sooner the better.</p>
<p>Relieved Hunter for hour &amp; half in evening &amp; couldn't say I was impressed by the work.</p>
