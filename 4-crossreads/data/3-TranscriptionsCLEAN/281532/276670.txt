Our five 77 guns captured at Dompierre were sent back to the War Museum by Miles yesterday. The front seems quiet from here. An India rubber gun is dropping an odd big one into the village of Herbecourt just beside us here. The loss of these prisoners this morning will upset our worthy friend the Boche. He could have made a very nasty stand on these heights overlooking the Somme had he determined to make his line here. Our men are still tired in spite of their two nights rest and the 7 miles march will not improve their condition. However as our bivouac formation is 24 23 22 21 it looks better.
