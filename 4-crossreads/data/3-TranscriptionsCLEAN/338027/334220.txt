  
 Wednesday, 4 August, 1915 Elfie's birthday & the anniversary of the proclamation of war by Britain.  We left the Clan at 5.30 loaded all our stores & equipment on to a trawler thence on to the Navy patrol boat the Heroic this was crowded with men of the Cheshire Regiment we arrived at Gallipoli at 10-30 and were back again to the sound of the guns  & flashes of fire, we snatched a little sleep then the Cheshire's started to disembark into lighters, they continued until 3.30 when a tug came for us, & all was bustle we could not get all our stores off in time as daybreak was approaching & the Turks could see us & started shelling the beach we then loaded our stores on to stretchers and had to carry them up the hill that our lads had to fight so hardly for, all the way up we were under heavy shrapnel fire, it bursting all over us but with no effect eventually we arrived at the top N.Z Gully and put our stretchers down where the N.Z F & Mounted Ambulances are after a hunt for wood we had a splendid breakfast of bully beef & biscuits. 
 Thursday, 5 August, 1915 After breakfast shells started to burst all around us so we had to dig ourselves in, some of the men have dug outs like furnished rooms, a mate & I built a beauty with some stretchers we had stolen but were discovered & as soon as we moved them they fell in so now we are just living in a hole in the ground like rabbits each man does his own cooking it is very amusing, we are only allowed a gallon of water a day & this is issued very carefully, our portion is most peculiar for an ambulance as we are next to the ammunition supply & A.S.C and there are two big howitzer gun placed near us whenever these fire a German aeroplane flies overhead looking for her, and as soon as it does shrapnel is fired on it by us.  There are only a few casualties a day two chaps were wounded through exposing themselves to snipers one chap was swimming.  After dusk I went for a walk through those marvellous saps to a well that is on the extreme left the water here is splendid.  I missed the snipers & walked home at a brisk pace then received my issue of rum & lay down to sleep in my little dug out in the [indecipherable].
