<p>Friday, 22 January, 1915<br/>In the morning went for a short march &amp; the drivers had some driving practice for the sports to-morrow.  I met with an accident and am forbidden to ride to morrow.  Afternoon was spent in preparing the sports ground.</p>
<p>The hospital and all the Aust doctors &amp; Nurses with Ambulance Motor waggons arrived at Maadi.  They are establishing a base hospital here as The Citadel and Mena House is full.</p>
<p>At night I recited and got a great reception at a concert given by the S. Aust Light Horse to the residents of Maadi.</p>
<p>Saturday, 23 January, 1915<br/>The sports were a great success, I could not compete but lent my pony "Sammy" to a mate.  We had the despatch and won easily, but unfortunately he could not pull Sammy up in time to hand his despatch over.  I wrote a full report that will appear in Monday's Egyptian Mail.  B Section won the aggregate only the minor races going to A.</p>
<p>We hear that when we move we are going to split and work separately.  It will make things more satisfactory &amp; stop the [indecipherable].</p>
