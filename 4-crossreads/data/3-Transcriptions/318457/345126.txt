<p>[1-4 th Nov 1914]</p>
<p>meeting taking place at Rev A.W. Bray's passage where on a previous visit in Sept. last year, I had spent several pleasant occasions.</p>
<p>We sailed from Albany about 8am on Sunday morning 1st Nov. with the convoy, the "Minotaur" guns? flagship and Melbourne at port flank while we were on starboard. Ships, 36 were in two lines, of three divisions. Off Fremantle the "Ibuki" a Japanese armed cruiser 4 12in guns joined us with two other troopships "Afric" and "[indecipherable]" w.a. [indecipherable] making the total of 38. We steamed mostly at 10 knots but the "Southern" had trouble in her engine room which reduced the speed to 8 to 9 Knots causing her to fall behind and also reducing the convoy's speed for a time. The "Pioneer" also joined us but on Tues. returned to Fremantle owing to engine break-down.</p>
<p>The weather was rough on Tues &amp; on Wed. 4th, heavy rolling, especially between 12 and 2am on Wed. when we rolled up to 28&deg; and 12 and up to 35&deg; about 2am. The starboard gun on waist deck dipped several feet in the water once in the afternoon and one of the guns on the boat deck dipped in the water at night.</p>
