  
 Friday 1 September 1916 Fatigue on pumps most of day pumping water for the horses. Also on helping to cart away manure. Got 4 more letters, one from Joan, one Dora. 
 Saturday 2 September 1916 Held horses at shoeing forge most of morning. In afternoon West, Dawson, Aire and I rode out on to the battle field looking for curios.  Only got some copper bands off shrapnel shells. Saw an awful lot of dead Turks.
