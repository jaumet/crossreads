<p>&amp; skirt &amp; hat which suited her to perfection. She was the tiniest bit nervous when she was being married, which only adds charm to a girl's appearance on her wedding-day, &amp; after the ceremony she got excited &amp; of course soon had an excellent colour.</p>
<p>It was such fun going to the gate &amp; calling out our last good-byes as Dr. &amp; Mrs. Watson departed on their honeymoon. If Ollie isn't congratulating himself hard on his wife he ought to, &amp; that is all about it. The bridesmaids looked awfully pretty in their brown dresses, of course the groomsman was absolutely perfect &amp; Ran made a very fine best man.</p>
<p>Heavens! I haven't mentioned the bridegroom! He too looked very fine in uniform &amp; made a nice speech at the supper. I do hope Ollie won't have to leave for a good while, it will be so lonely for Hazel when he goes &amp; she is so young. An old lady like me can afford to talk in that strain.</p>
<p>I am so awfully glad you</p>
