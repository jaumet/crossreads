<p>I will finish off this letter now and begin a new one for the same mail.<br/>Much love dearest Mother &amp; Father. I long to see you and be home again &ndash; though not till the war is over. I am sorry Mr Allen has not been well. I am sure he must have great anxiety about Dennis.<br/>Goodnight my heavenly parents.<br/>Ever your devoted daughter<br/>Betha McMillan<br/>I think if Roslyn gets my letter it should be shown to Colonel Jamieson too.<br/>Betha</p>
