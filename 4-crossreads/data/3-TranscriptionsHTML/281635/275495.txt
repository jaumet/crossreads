<p>St &amp; saw Mr Dick Holsom. He told me Claire Holsom only went back from leave on Monday &amp; that Billy Holsom was passed. He would have taken me out to his place only he has just had an addition to the family. After leaving PB &amp; Cos went back to Tottenham Ct Rd. by Bus, had tea at a restaurant &amp; went per tube via the bank to Clapham Common to see Uncle Charlie. He was out when I arrived at his place so after waiting about &frac12; hr I left again, after leaving some souvenirs for him to mind. I arrived back about &frac12; past 9 feeling very tired. On way from Dover by train had a fine view</p>
