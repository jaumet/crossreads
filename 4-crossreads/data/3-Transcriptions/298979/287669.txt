<p>it been a General describing the full situation it could hardly have been clearer. The City in the neighbourhood of the post office where the most severe fighting took place, was very much "knocked about" by shell fire.</p>
<p>What! said the Sentry, When I first came up I discovered a boy, whereas now I see before me a veritable Military General! It is a good job you are not in uniform otherwise I would have had to salute you!!. The youngster quietly smiled.</p>
<p>The Sentry had really induced the boy t talk, as much to listen to his "brogue" as any thing else, but soon marvelled at his wonderful description.</p>
<p>Coming down the spiral staircase, parts of it are very dark, the Sentry wearing an overcoat, found the lower portion kept dragging over the steps at the back &amp; fearing the boy might in the dark step upon it, &amp; have a nasty fall turned round, &amp; imitating as well as he was able an Irishman, in a gruff voice Dont trid on the tale of me coat? Says he</p>
<p>In an equally gruff voice the boy answered Naw! You naw the penalty? says the Sentry, Yes! says the boy. What? says the Sentry. Death!! says the boy</p>
<p>The Sentry laughed the whole way down the stairs. Be dad! instid of a Giniral, you're an Actor said the Sentry as he bade the youngster Good bye.</p>
<p>Coming back to Belfast and anxious to have a trip in an Irish Chaise or jaunting Car, driven by a typical "jarvey" the Sentry made enquiries where to go &amp; what to pay, after explaining his reason, was told the fare is 1s/- but if you let the driver talk you will have to pay 2s/-. The Sentry paid 2s/-</p>
<p>By a little judicious questioning the blarney was started, &amp; was so thoroughly enjoyable that at 2s/- it was cheap.</p>
<p>The Sentry was sorry he had not more time to spare, otherwise</p>
