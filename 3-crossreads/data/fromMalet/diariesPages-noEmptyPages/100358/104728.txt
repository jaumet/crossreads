We have all been reduced to the ranks, that is, all NCOs who brought the reinforcements over - Oct Nov.9th. They will not recognise any Australian schools of instruction over here, which is very remarkable when you consider the large cost of sending us to schools in Australia. My candid opinion too, judging by the N.C.O's. drilling us now, is that the Schools of Instruction in Australia are very good and as up to date as could be expected. Of course minute details differ somewhat, and men with active service experience must be credited with a lot, but to totally discredit Australian Schools in which are many instructors returned from Flanders and Gallipoli, is nothing short of ridiculous. This being so I have determined to try and get into the next draught leaving for France, where promotion is permanent.
12th Nov. 1916
I am in the draught for France as a private, and expect to move soon. There are 10 men in all. One, J. Brown, left Sydney with me on the Orsova on the 14th July 1915. He was shot in the mouth in Gallipoli returned to Australia. Now we leave together again. Rather a coincidence. Our training is strenuous. Musketry, - mostly rapid loading firing, bayonet fighting ? rushing trenches, stabbing using butts, and gas helmet drill. These are the most important and advanced parts of Infantry Training. But its dreadfully cold, and the rifle chisels junks of skin from your knuckles and hands. Our feet get like blocks of ice standing at musketry practice, and the rifle is so cold we can hardly do anything with it. It rains nearly every day, and we are often wet through. But they give us no latitude.
Reveille went at 4 am. on 16th Nov. Thursday. We were to move off, bound for France. The 3rd Btn detail was only 10 men, the total for the brigade a small batch of 54 in all. My, it was cold. A few old pals got up to see us off. We had a warm breakfast and then marched to the Battalion
