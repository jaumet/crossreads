Monsieur again took une photographie de la petite Chretienne" ? a solemn and serious ceremony. Yesterday and today being Fte de Pentecote and WhitSunday there are many preparations in the way of white dresses etc. for the "premiere communion". Met Colonel Watson, Macgregor, B.M. in the street just over for a look round. As the Engineers etc. still use our parade ground this afternoon I cancelled the parade and put on the Sports finals instead. There was some excellent sport. The boxing resulted in a win for Sailor Parsons in his class and Caffrey lost on a foul to Binns in the heavyweights. Tugs of war also gave some good events and a very merry good afternoon's sport was enjoyed by everyone. Spent the evening talking to Madame at the Regimental Office billet and drank a glass of her extra special pre-war brewed liquer ? made by a select recipe and only produced on a grand occasions.
