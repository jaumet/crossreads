My dear Alan,It was nice to get your letter about my engagement. I can assure you I feel most honoured in having a brother, who so charmingly expresses his opinion as regards his new sister. But really Alan Dene & I are awfully grateful for your good wishes. We are quite old engaged people by now & behave with much decorum (in public of course).
Out here we have heard of Niven, Noel, & Cairns having arrived in Egypt France & I am wondering whether you & Tom are there too. Tom's last letter told of being moved from Alexandria to some far away place in the desert.
You have of course heard detailed accounts of the wedding long before this. We did miss you so much & feel we would have given a lot to have you there. It is at such a time that one wants the whole family to be together I think.
It was all so awfully pretty & nicely arranged & Hazel looked perfectly lovely. She was married in a white coat
