MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 1919.
Fine & hot, but came up a baby
storm at night. Got   points.
I lopped in 4D, Middle & Mountain
paddocks, & then started cutting
the cotton bush in Wheelers.
Tickle had the poison cart working
in Mountain & Boundary.
Peter started the 4D sheep at
Abbottslea.
Harold Barnes came out and
took my wool in 35 bales.
