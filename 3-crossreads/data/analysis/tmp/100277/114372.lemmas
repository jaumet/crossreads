 this afternoon near everi gun must have been in action the vibrat was veri pronounc , Fritz show his good sens kept fair quiet while it was on . 9 Boch gave themselv up last night , as one of them was pass us he point to one of the patch on our back said " No Bon , " he knew what the patch were meant for . A littl while ago I unearth a good store of Fritz 's iron ration , we had a good feed off them his tin meat is someth like brawn to tast , is veri good . It is cruel to see the state some of the men are in , they have to wade through mud right up to their arm pit , in this aw state they have to stop for it will be sever day yet befor we are reliev it enough to kill ani man , it would not be so bad if we had dri dugout to go to or had a chang of cloth , but no , neither of these are to be had .
