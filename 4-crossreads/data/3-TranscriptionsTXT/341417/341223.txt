 Dear Drs. 
 I received a letter from Dr. Crawley dated 30-7-15 &amp; well as a letter, which I have answered, from Mrs. Dunlop some time previously. Many Thanks. 
 I am back at Galipolli &amp; generally contented. At present diarrhoea is the cause of putting large numbers of the troops out of action, a number of Enteric cases contributing also. 
 The situation is quiet, compared with earlier stages and the action here in co-operation with the Suvla Bay Landing is the last important "scrap". I am at present at the junction of Chailok &amp; Aghyl Deres (Two gullies) or I should say, on the range at the head of them. 
 It is some of the new area we captured in August. A "hot" place too. One of my men received the Military Cross for bravery &amp; resourcefulness under fire. Out of sixty who landed only 13 are here now. Many were killed, wounded
