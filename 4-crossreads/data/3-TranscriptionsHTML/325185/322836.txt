<p>I have had a good run &amp;amp: the luck of old Nick.  But am a bit nervy about it this trip one cant keep going in &amp;amp: out. Oh well the next may be an Australia that will do me.  As for beating Fritz of coarse we shall beat him he knows it too but he cant stop now has to go the whole lot &amp;amp: so have we that is how things stand. Today's paper suggests Japan is going to step in with Russia. I have been expecting that Oh well it is the only thing to be done. Germany will take all before her across there unless something is done so it is a case of just smile. We have to beat Germany this time so just as well to do it properly. Well Father I cant settle to write cant think of anything to write about so will close for this time with love &amp;amp: best wishes<br/>from your loving son Clyde   (6)<br/>Address to Batt. As usual Clyde</p>
