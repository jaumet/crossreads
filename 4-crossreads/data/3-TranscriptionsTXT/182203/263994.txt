Next day not a word about where we were to go or what to do. I spent the bed day in bed, felt ill - the other 9 did not know what to do, sat around awaiting events. Our luggage out in the boiling sun on the Piazza all day.

It is really a overflow hospital from here - well we were very glad to be of use to someone. Am in luck's way  Major Webb is the principal Medico    & Miss Cornwall is Matron  they gave us a great welcome, so we are very happy also very busy. The hospital is managed splendidly, so get a day off duty once a fortnight. I am to get next Saturday
