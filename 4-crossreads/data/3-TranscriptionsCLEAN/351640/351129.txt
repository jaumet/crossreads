Yesterday afternoon another train load of sick and wounded arrived at this hospital from Galipoli; only a few of them being stretcher cases.
The enclosed small photograph has been given to me by Captain Henry. He took it when I was at the top of the 2nd pyramid (Kephren), he standing near the Sphynx, you may judge how far away by the intervening stretch of sand, the light was dim, about 5 p.m., hence the result is poor in every way, & I with my flag was too small an object, perched high up, to make impress on the sensitive sheet. Henry said that he heard the words I spoke, saw me pose for the photograph, & levelled the camera at me and chanced it. Note the irregular edge of the lower margin of the casing. Along the side seen in the picture the guide & I ascended. The photo is amusing.
Tata. Shall add more anon.
9 p.m. Some papers and a post card came from Mrs Knowles of Melbourne during the afternoon but your letters, Car Joe dears, have not been delivered.
All has been going quietly during the day. I occupied the morning at post mortems in the Mortuary.
Mrs Knowles sent to me a copy of Cardinal Newman's "The Dream of Gerontius", adorned with coloured illustrations, rather a gem in its way. I must write to thank her for it.Mrs Bacon and her daughter called here this evening I was talking to them for a few minutes. Both looked well The old lady has apparently quite recovered from her indisposition.Good night [A line of Xs and Os.] Car. Good night [A line of Xs and Os.] Joe. Good night [A line of Xs and Os.] Kit.
23-11-15 - 7 A.M.:- Good morning. Hope I that the letters will come today. It is strange that those posted by Car at the same time as she dropped your's Kitty dear into the box have not arrived. Those post office gentlemen again.
Once again "Aurora rosy daughter of the dawn" has looked in my window
