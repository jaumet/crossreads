<p>getting home as I have to spend at least two days in Sydney to have a Turkish Bath &amp; get any clothes etc.  However Kismet.  Still it is annoying I should have liked to be home for Xmas.  This is a terribly dull boat.  Nothing to do, nothing to read, and I believe that they will fete us in Melbourne &amp; Sydney which means more time lost.</p>
<p>14.12.18<br/>I personally have now given up all hope of spending Xmas on land.  We have only just reached Freemantle [Fremantle] today owing to a heavy head wind &amp; sea most of the way from Colombo.  Also we have to undergo short quarantine of two or three days &amp; call at Albany to put off the Westralians</p>
