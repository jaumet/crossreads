<p>The new Chancellor's speech was published in yesterdays paper as follows :&ndash; He, Dr Michaelis would not have taken over the heavy task now before him, had he not fully believed in the Justice of the German Cause. Germany had been forced to make war, although Dr B. Hollweg had done his utmost to avoid it. The U. Boat campaign had been forced upon them thro England's mode of fighting by the "Starvation Blockade" after Germany had lost all hope of Americas intervention. It was the only means left to them &amp; it had proved more valuable, &amp; is still doing so, than it was ever expected it would be. The latest offensive of the Russians had only brought the latter a very slight advantage &amp; he had just recd a telegram from the front saying that Prince Leopold of Bavaria's troops had broken through the Russian Defences. All other fronts were being held &amp; the enemys hope of help from America were in vain. They could therefore meet all things with equanimity. In spite of all, there is a general wish for peace. Germany had not desired the war nor wished to make conquests</p>
