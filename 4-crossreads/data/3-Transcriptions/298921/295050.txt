<p>March, 1915<br/>Thursday 18<br/>Beautiful mornings now, but the Dust &amp; sand is desperate, Had a long day out by Moses Well, (where he used to camp) about 3000 mounted men doing <u>quick</u> work.

Willis Book on Egypt, I think it is called, Before Christ came to Egypt &ndash; one can realize many things in the Testament now, such as stoning a man to death &ndash; the Desert is all small stones just the size to throw well &amp; the prickly thorn bush, with which they crowned the Saviour grows in the sandy patches.</p>
