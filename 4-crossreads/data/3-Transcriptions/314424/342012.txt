<p>Saturday June 8. 1918. 1404.<br/>A fine day, but dull &amp; cloudy.</p>
<p>There was the usual artillery duels last night. The enemy is still shelling back areas &amp; we can hear the retort of his guns the shells whizzing overhead &amp; later the bursts of the explosions in some of the villages or in Amiens. All most every day he shells camon. The paper reports another air raid on Paris which makes the 39 since the war started. 14 American [Indecipherable] ships have been torpored &amp; mined on the American coast by Submarines of a large type &amp; capable of staying a month away from their bases.</p>
