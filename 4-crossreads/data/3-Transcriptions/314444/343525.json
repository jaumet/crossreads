<p>long well-earned rest within sound of the guns whose discordant sound he knew so well. A neat little cross marks his grave.</p>
<p>I had hoped to see him again before his interment but arrived at the grave just a few minutes late.</p>
<p>The forwarding to you of his effects <strike>who</strike>  is safe in the hands of our chaplain, while a couple of parcels from home arriving for him today I have given "Billy" as his best pal. I know you will approve of this.</p>
<p>Poor old Billy is very quiet today. He knows what a faithful chum has gone.</p>
<p>In this your time of sorrow let me hope that the knowledge that he died voluntarily a true hero's death beloved and mourned by all will in no small way help to lessen the blow delivered you.</p>
