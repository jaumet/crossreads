till we got to Freemantle but since then it has been remarkably calm. We have plenty of sport on board generally a bit of a concert at night. Well Sis there is really nothing to tell you for you can see that there is not much to happen on a boat worth writing about, so you must excuse short letter can only repeat again that you will have every happiness no trouble when the event occurs. With fondest Love from your Brother.
