 Sinn Fein Song / current 1918 ( brought back from Ireland by Don McKinnon ) I ll sing you a ditti of Dublin 's fair citi , And a place call Mountjoy which all of you know ; ?Twas there of all place the boy cut the trace And got out of prison , aliv , aliv Oh . The first was bold Barton , when he was departin ? , Left a note for the Boss , his polit to show ; And a dummi in order to fool the poor warder But Barton had hop it , aliv , aliv Oh . J.J. Walsh and Pierc Beasley the trick did suit gas ?li , Some pro-German devil a ladder did throw ; Then some twenti Sinn Feiner , like acrobat trainer , Scale the wall and got free all aliv , aliv Oh . They re think tomorrow , to call it Mountsorrow , It 's made of John Bull such a terribl show : His prison no longer have lock ani stronger , To keep in Sinn Feiner aliv , aliv Oh . I ll finish my rhyme now , I think it 's near time now , The peopl are laugh wherev you go , It 's caus great elat in this ancient nation , Sinn Feiner , pro-Irish , aliv , aliv Oh .
