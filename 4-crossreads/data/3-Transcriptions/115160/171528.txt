<p>Sunday 29th</p>
<p>It was a lovely morning but it has come on to rain again. &nbsp;Last night we saw a Fritz caught in the lights. &nbsp;One of ours was after him, but after dropping his load in the bushes to get away, he managed to regain his own territory.</p>
<p>I have been in the habit of including most of the letters I receive from Scotland when I send my &quot;Greenie&quot;. &nbsp;I&#39;m afraid&nbsp;this will stop, for more stringent censorship forbids this practice.</p>
<p>I sent today a few illustrated newspapers and a German sand-bag enclosed. &nbsp;You will note that it is all paper too.</p>
<p>Well, Love, there is not much else to mention at present. &nbsp;I am quite OK and hope you are all in the same good health and spirits. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fondest love to Bess &amp; Lock, and all the best for yourself.</p>
<p>Your loving Son</p>
<p>James xxxxxx</p>
