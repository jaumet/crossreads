  
 It is a bit of a pang to leave my little Pony of whom I am genuinely in love with, but it cannot be helpful & I suppose it is only me who knows how sorry I am in leaving him. I have had him now 9 months  - in Egypt & France & during that time he has been constantly under fire & escaped without so much as a scratch. It is also a bit of a pang to leave all the chaps with whom I have been closely associated with for the past 12 months but again never mind.

As far as I have gone it is a very decent job about 3 hours work & I am finished for the day. 
 My Section are a very decent lot of chaps among whom I struck 1 of the old [indecipherable] Boys & one from Merrylands named Len who is my clerk. The weather is bitterly cold & I can scarcely hold my pencil. I intend writing
