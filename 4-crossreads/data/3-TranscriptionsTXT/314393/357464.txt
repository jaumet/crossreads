 On resuming the journey I noticed a large number of wounded stretcher cases while passing the dressing station lying a much under cover as possible, also a number being loaded into a big two horse ambulance which had been able to get that far up under cover of darkness. After passing the top of the hill above the dressing station we made our way down "Sausage Gully" still being troubled by the enemy's artillery which however became less troublesome the further we walked back. When the centre of the gully was  reached the noise from our artillery there was terrific for they were returning the hun's fire with equal if not more velocity. After passing Jacksons Dump in the gully we were no longer troubled by shells but owing to being overtired &amp; the night being dark our progress was very slow but eventually found the company field kitchen in Bucourt Wood. As soon as it was known that we had arrived fresh from the front line, the cooks &amp; details who were camped there belonging to our battalion, bombarded us with all sorts of questions regarding the front line &amp; casualties for previously their news had only been second hand. Even while my mate &amp; I sat eating a meal which the cooks had prepared the questions were still coming my way, these being answered as best I could. On completing the meal the battalion Quarter master came to inform me that I would be required to go with a party to the front line at daybreak. He also instructed my mate &amp; I to remain with the cooks that night taking advantage of the few hours before daylight having as much sleep &amp; rest as possible. It was not long before I lay down for a rest in the cooks dugout but sleep was a long way off for being overtired I became restless so lie there listening to the rumble of both artilleries which were still firing as strong as ever, wondering how my less fortunate mates were faring in the front line.
