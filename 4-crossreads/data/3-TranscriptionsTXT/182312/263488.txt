 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of 17th March the Australians entered 
 Bapaume on the heels of the German rear guard.&nbsp; A few snipers 
 remained but their toll was small and they were soon cleared out. 
 But what a mess the town was in!&nbsp; Every building had been 
 systematically destroyed not by gun fire byt by internal explosions 
 so that the roofs were blown off and the walls caved in.&nbsp; The 
 roads were lined with smouldering heaps of brickwork where once 
 stood fine buildings.&nbsp; The day following our occupation of 
 Bapaume, the town presented a busy appearance.&nbsp; Whilst our Brass 
 Band played in the streets, hundreds of men were set to work 
 clearing up the rubbish, pushing down dangerous walls, repairing 
 roads and where possible repairing buildings sufficiently to 
 provide at least some shelter for troops who would be required to 
 billet there.&nbsp; My own Battalion had occupied the pretty little 
 village of Biefvillers on a hill on the outshirts of the town and 
 we were put to work to set the place in order.&nbsp; Whilst we were 
 entrenched near Grevillers this village of Biefvillers was right 
 in front of us, only about 1,000 yards away and we had admired 
 some of the buildings therein, particularly a few better class 
 chateaux which we had looked forward to occupying.&nbsp; Alas, our 
 hopes were shattered on our arrival in the village for the Hun 
 had been careful to leave us no such comfortable shelter.&nbsp; But 
 still Biefvillers was not as badly destroyed as most villages and 
 we set to work with a will to effect repairs.&nbsp; First the roads 
 had to be repaired where Fritz had blown holes in them, then after 
 deciding which buildings could be made inhabitable, parties of men 
 were put on to this work which progressed in great style.
