 My darling Eddy     XOXOXO 
 Your letter was lovely   &  you are writing very clever letters now. You will be a very big boy when I return. Hope you are having a jolly holiday   &  shall be able to go every day next term to school. You must tell me all about your Nature Study lessons   &  your Physical Culture. I can hardly imagine you a big boy at school now. Fondest love   &  kisses  OXOXOXOX From XOX Auntie Eadle.
