<p>Ypres has been a fine city<br/>A thick wall encloses it making it very strong. It has been the scene of the bitterest fighting in the war. This is the 3rd great battle that has been waged at its gates &amp; the slain have been in thousands There is not one single house which is not absolutely wrecked. The beautiful Cloth Hall a magnificent place in peace time is now a ruin. The country is flat with a rise up towards what were Bosh trenches about 3 miles away &amp; it was for the occupation of this important ridge which overlooks miles of plain country beyond that, this terrific struggle is taking place</p>
