<p>Saw some Tommies lined up in Downing St, in front of Prime Minister's residence, to air their grievances re demobilisation. A motor-load of them also passed me in Bayswater Rd and gave me a cheer in passing &ndash; on a/c of being an Aussie I suppose. After tea went home early. Fairly fine.</p>
<p>8.1.19<br/>Rec'd letters from Mother, Muriel, Ivie and Partridge. Muriel told me Mother not at all well, having chronic Brights Disease.</p>
<p>Took tram to Savoy St via Elephant and Castle and Blackfriars and went to Shipping Office &ndash; no alteration re boat. Then went to Anzac Buffet and wrote to Ivie and Partridge, also a London friend. Uncle Charlie ill in bed today, so rang up his firm for him. After tea went for walk via Grosvenor Place, Park Lane, Baker St, Marylebone Rd, Gt Portland St, Oxford St, Charring X Rd, Trafalgar Sq and Whitehall back to Victoria St, then took tram home.</p>
