 Arrived Assuit 
 Left Minia 11.30 
 Revielle at 6 
 Finished loading &amp; getting the stuff down to the train by 9.30 then loaded onto it, the first batch of horses came down at 9.30 &amp; we had them all on by 10.30, the train moved out at 11.30 &amp; going down there was plenty of joy for half the boys were sprung &amp; several were worse. 
 Arrived Assuit at 2 pm, the town is a beauty, the buildings being very fine &amp; mostly on the American principal. We are camped right on the canal &amp; about &frac34; of a mile N of the town, the roads are both wide &amp; good &amp; many good shops are also here. 
 On the E of the town is the American colony, the men of whom run the University, the aviators have pitched their camp in the Race course so now the bookies will have a spell. 
 Bed at 9.30

 Revielle at 5.30 
 Started making camp straight away, the defaulters doing the bulk of the work, one of whom I had to spread-eagle yesterday for insolence to the C.O., his nibs wanted to keep him out all night without blankets or rugs or food but we prevailed on him to alter his mind. 
 We were just getting along nicely when the Brig stopped us saying we probably would be moving in a day or two &amp; not to go to too much trouble with our camp. 
 Charlie &amp; I had a ride round the town this afternoon &amp; found it even nicer than we thought, the streets being laid out in the latest styles. 
 Met a chap in the camel corps who knows Wally H well, wrote letters to home &amp; Alec, no mail going out for 6 weeks. 
 Bed at 10.
