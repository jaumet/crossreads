I did not report at out billets as I preferred to be back in the line to doing fatigues. I might mention that at this time our ambulance was also running two other ads's - Old Brewery and Motor Car Corner each with their own RAP's. 
 To these three ads's the ratons were brought by one of our g.s. (general service) wagons. A couple of times I had been out with it to look after the rations. On the 8th April Easter Sunday when the cart was going from "Old Brewery" to "Charing Cross" a shell lobbed on the cobbled road behind it killing our three men in the wagon immediately. They were Jimmy Bridson the driver and Cpl Gus Dyer (pack store corporal) and Ernie Porter of the quartermasters store. All were original 9th Field Ambulance men. This accident cast a gloom over the remainder of the ambulance as these were our first serious casualties and two of the men's brothers were in the unit
