16/1/19 Brussells
there were buskers in the streets. We went into a large picture show at a cost of 3d each and sat at tables where beer was served. An excellent programme of pictures was thrown on the screen. At 10.30 returned to hotel lounge and sat there talking with the General and Col. James. The demimonde activity was apparent and English officers of the war time abounded. At 11 p.m. James and I went to the Gaiety tea shop which apes the Cairo casino. Dancing and drinking. Scores of girls. Some clad in tights and others daringly dressed and seeming to have bare legs up to the waist. Suggestive dancing, drinking and importuning the place was fast and furious and fellows were openly caressing their girls. Constant cadging for band and dancers. Caf Madrid was quiet at 1 pm and 1.30 saw me in bed.
