 13/7/18 Boulogne-sur-Mer A fine day. In the morning took a paper and read on the seafront. Along the quays the characteristic loose redbloused seafarers are a striking feature of the scene. After lunch again went down and this time sat right on the beach close to the waters edge. A few people bathing. W.A.A.C.s walking along the cynosure of all eyes. Rather a fresh sea running. Dined at the club having as table companion a miserable little Yiddisher- Scotch Second Lieutenant. After dinner an English second Lieut M.M. &amp; Mons ribbon was drunkenly sick in the smoking room &amp; forced everyone to evacuate the place. Feeling very tired went round to the [indecipherable] club and there did this writing read the papers etc.
