Took 50 men into Bailleul for a bath this afternoon but it wasn't much good too much red tape about it for my liking, I refused to have one on account of some of the regulations
3rd. Sunday nearly the whole Coy is on fatigue, for we are Duty Company
4th. Usual parades I scored a little victory in one way for when the Colonel Major came round, they wanted to know if all the platoons were organized mine was the only one that was I had no officer either, done it on my own account, besides I have every little detail fixed up correctly.
McNabb Dimock went away with "scabies" today but they never got very far only to the D.R.S. they are very prevalent throughout the Div. I reckon 70% of the troops have these pests in a more or less severe form, I still have them myself, I am frightened to go near a military bath with them for they would surely grab a chap shoot you
