<p>November 1918.<br/>Saturday 30</p>
<p>Wembley. Bristol and Wembley<br/>Oh! What a life.<br/>Travelled up town caught 12.7 pm for Bristol, returned after a wild goose chase, to Wembley, per District tram and boot.<br/>Arrived home at 1 am quite a respectable hour, and felt absolutely exhausted.<br/>After such a tiring day. Wondering whether old Smithy got a bad. I hope he did.</p>
