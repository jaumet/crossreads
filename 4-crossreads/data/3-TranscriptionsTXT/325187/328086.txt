 [Saturday 9 December 1917] 
 I have 4 Blankets 2 for Bivouac &amp; 2 for Cover   Midday warm midnight very cold &amp;  [indecipherable] Days   Bed Soks are just the thing. Enemy Taube over this morning but no bombs Rode to  Mazar  still hunting for Kit. Tommy Orford from Big Yanko is my Batman again, a good chap.  Long letter from Wee wife- she is well-  Our Patrols exchanged shots with enemy today.  General Cox is my C.O. now; General Meredith went to Australia but is returning, I doubt if he will come to this Brigade though-
