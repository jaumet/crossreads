 Dear Mrs. Jack, 
 You'll be thinking I'm a pig but we haven't been allowed to write for a week or so &amp; even now this is a chance shot but I hope it will get through.  I have been terribly busy too &amp; we have been on the move &amp; under those circumstances I never get a minutes peace.  I hate moving, really at such times I wouldn't mind being dead but I pick up again.  I'm sure if I ever get back I'll need explosives under me to shift me when I have to shift. 
 I'm very homesick today.  Chancellor sent me a lot of snaps of Tog &amp; they made me very chokey, I wanted to crawl away in a quiet corner.  They are such good snaps of the dear old place, the river &amp; the punt &amp; the old cottage &amp; the garden &amp; one of the dining room with the pink shades on the lamp.  Also one of the tennis court with Mac &amp; the boys.  And your letter came too with the snap of you all at Hay &amp; made it worse.  And its Sunday afternoon &amp; it just made me think of Sunday afternoons, those deliciously lazy Sunday afternoons at Tog where we all did as we liked &amp; mostly loafed after &amp; before good meals.   The meals  I could do with a few of those meals now.  Our fodder 
 [Note at top of page] My love to Nerida.  And I'm most annoyed at your saying or suggesting I was  loose .  Why, my dear --  We'll have to thresh that out later.  So long.
