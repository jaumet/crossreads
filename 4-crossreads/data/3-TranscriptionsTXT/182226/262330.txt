 Tried to see the paymaster about getting some extra money &amp; found him a very hard man to see. Had to give it up till next week. 
 Some of the prices in Malta are worth noting. Shave 1d., 100 good cigarettes 1/-, a decent cigar 1d., Haircut 2d., beer 2&frac12; pint. It is a big contrast to Egypt. Have felt pretty crook today. 
 The meal hours are breakfast 7.30, Dinner 12.45, Tea 4 p.m. We have out tea just about the time that people at home are having afternoon tea in their drawing room. 
 The meal consists of bread &amp; butter &amp; has to last 15&frac12; hours. Just think of it.
