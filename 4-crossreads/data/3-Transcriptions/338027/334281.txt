<p>Sunday, 6th December, 1914<br/>Moved about a mile to get into position before leaving the men are very eager to get to Alexandria &amp; are chafing at delay.  Mails were sent from here to-day but we were informed that a boat would call in ten minutes, it did not call until next day so our letters were very brief Orvieto &amp; Miltidaes gone on to England after unloading.
