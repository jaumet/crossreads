Dear Mr. Layton,Mrs. Brown appears in need of assistance until her husband is able to fill in the Papers at Camp for her allowances. There has been considerable delay over this. They were living apart before he enlisted owing to the fact that he drinks - Now he is ill either with measles or scarlet fever & the Papers are still unfilled - Her daughter is not receiving wages regularly -
Yours sincerelyE. M. Wallack
