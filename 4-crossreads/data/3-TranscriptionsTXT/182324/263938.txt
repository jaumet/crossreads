 Dear Mr Leplastrier 
 Thank you very much for the copy of the &quot;Yandoo&quot; which you left at the office for me. I am very pleased with it &amp; shall put it with my other treasures of the war. 
 I quite remember your son now that I have again seen the Photo, but it was a little difficult to bring him to memory for the moment. 
 I was at the Port Street Congregational Church on Sunday Night (Armistice Day) &amp; heard the Rev. Ruth give an address on &quot;Lest we forget&quot; It was splendid &amp; it must have given heart &amp; courage to many of the congregation who were still mourning the loved one taken &amp; it was splendid when he said &quot;Yes 58000 gave their lives for us! but they still live, they are here  now , gazing at us with their bright shining eyes.&quot; I could not help thinking what a beautiful thought. We could not see them but they were there
