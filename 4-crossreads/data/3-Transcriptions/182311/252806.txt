<p><u>7.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7</p>
<p>two hours late.&nbsp; Instead of leaving town at 9.30 pm twas 11.30 pm &amp; as the train crawled through the fog I did not see bed until 4.30 am to be rudely aroused by a voice saying &quot;Hard Luck Harold but the Major says you are the only officer available for Orderly Officer so up I get &amp; after 90 minutes sleep carry on with to-day&#39;s work.&nbsp; I&#39;ve got to wait up till <s>ten</s> 10.15 pm tonight hence this long letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I discussed a few ideas &amp; ambitions re any commercial future with M<sup>r</sup> Clarke he says that there is every possibility of my doing well along those lines if after the war I am as able as I was before enlistment.&nbsp; Sounds Good, Eh!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; With all Love</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincerely Yrs</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Harold</u></p>
