Nowell had dinner last night with me &amp; he told me he had a Reinforcement to the Camels of a man by name TOM KIDNEY!!! who was educated at the Warrnambool College &ndash; that was a few years ago. Was it not Kidney who said he was late for School coz he had to stand "to attention" as the Band played God Save the Queen &amp; so he missed his train!!  Mrs. Davis Red X superintendent is sending for me some BASKETS made from NILE REEDS by natives of ASSUAN, do you for Work Baskets etc. if you ever get them.</p>
