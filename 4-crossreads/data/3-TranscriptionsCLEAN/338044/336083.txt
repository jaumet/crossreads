2nd October 1915.  Awakened at 6 am as usual & the rough weather expected has arrived. The boat is rolling &  pitching a little  &  I have a feeling that before many hours have passed I'll be very seasick.  Have a good wash &  brush up in anticipation, but not willing to risk going to breakfast. Manage to get my kit &  blankets stowed away  &  after mainly trying to fight the sickness off until well into the afternoon, eventually give in  & "heave - o", then lay down on deck, occasionally getting up for a walk.
Feel so terribly ill at night that have to get a friend to bring a hammock    &  blankets up, which I sling in the bathroom of hospital &  do not care if the ship goes down. Might mention that I am not the only one in this predicament.
