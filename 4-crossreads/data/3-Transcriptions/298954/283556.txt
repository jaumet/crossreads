<p>1918<br/>Tue.  1st Jan.<br/>At the conclusion of the programme they played the Hamburger "homeward-bound" song and all the Germans sang the chorus in very excited fashion, demanded an encore, and wildly cheered the strutting bantam-cock on the bridge.</p>
<p>The chorus went:-<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holdrio, es geht nach Heimat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holdrio, yur schonen Heimat.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holdrio, es geht nach Heimat,<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Holder-rie-ei-rie-ei-rie es gaht nach Haus'."</p>
<p>And musical snobs try to tell us that English popular songs are <u>so</u> inferior to the German and French.</p>
<p>Fri. 4th Jan<br/>Sail sighted 8 am, passed at 11.30.   Being neutral the vessel was passed, but a little later mein Herr Kommandant decided to sink her since "dead Neutrals tell no tales".<br/>I watched the chase from the port-hole, the full armament was swung on to the vessel and she surrendered.</p>
