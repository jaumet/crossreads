<p>a bit of fun.  One of the NZealanders had a flare pistol &amp; some flares, with which we frightened the dickens out of the niggers.</p>
<p>Sunday 26th<br/>Arrived at Zeitoun about 2 am &amp; had a 2 mile march  We camped in a mess room for the rest of the night.  Had no blankets but felt tired &amp; slept fairly well on one of the mess tables.  There was 95 of our Brigade.  The rest are all split up in different parties.  We got a good breakfast about 9 am &amp; were practically the first to get back from the peninsular.  The camps are much better than they were when we were here last &amp; the quality of the food has likewise improved.  We were well treated at Zeitoun, the cooks turning out &amp; making tea.  We also got a good breakfast &amp; dinner, receiving a plum pudding each.  All the boys have stuck together</p>
