<p>VISIT TO HAZEBROUCK<br/>[17TH Aug. contd]<br/>which he was almost sure to take first thing in the morning.  He made a second trip but kept clear of Ballieul &amp; presumably went to Hazebrouck.</p>
<p>Saturday 18th<br/>In the afternoon after we had finished our work Fred Cook [e] &amp; I decided to have a run to Hazebrouck &amp; with that intention we set out at 2.15 pm.  Walked to Ballieul obtained a lorry to Meteren.  Had the luck to strike an ambulance going to St Omer &amp; had a bon ride thro Fletre, Caestre on to Sylvestre.  From there we got another lorry which took us right into Hazebrouck.  Saw the damage done by recent shelling &amp; bombing.  In two instances two terraces of 3 houses had almost been demolished by shells (15 inch naval variety).</p>
<p>Thence to Railway Station after we had a look thro L'Eglise Notre Dame.  Saw some chaps from 2nd 1st &amp; 5th Divisions flitting around.  The Hotel de Ville quite a treat to look at.  Forgot to mention that while at station the French Poilus leave train came thro' from Ypres.  Place seemed deserted &amp; the people were quitting to the country on account of the shelling.  Just before leaving we had the unpleasant experience of seeing a couple of hundred refugees from Armentieres arrive with their belongings.  Armentieres was to be evacuated by civvies today</p>
