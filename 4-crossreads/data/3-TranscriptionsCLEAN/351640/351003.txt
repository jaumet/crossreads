  
 it is strange that there is not a picture of them upon the remembering tablets of my mind, they must come in after the Jakarandas [Jacarandas], and it is stranger still that I did not remark upon the sequence of the flowering. Here the Mhor trees are grown extensively as garden and street features. Pointiana Regia or Golden Mhor Tree. I should have remembered that the name was Arthur Usher. I have often enough heard the boys about town call him by his christian name. I did not know that Colone House from Orange had been sick. I must make enquiries. 
 There is nothin in you four girls that pleases me more, and I presume that others make the same observation, than the way in which each of you shows consideration for the other three, both in public and in private, your doing so has contributed much to the happiness of my life, and has given me good reason for admiring you on many occasions when you little thought that I was looking or listening. Such a disposition towards one another by sisters is twice blessed, it blesses themselves and blesses those to whom it sets good example. God will bless you for it and give to you ample reward. It is horrid to listen to children of one family who are impolite to one another, and if they be so in public, how much more so must they be in private. 
 This is Sunday morning. When I was at the Basilica, in Heliopolis, 9.30 Mass, I noticed Mrs. Jack Paton there and a lady with her. When mass was ended we met on the verandah, and Mrs P. introduced me to the younger lady. I did not recognise that she was formerly Miss Lane-Mullins. She is now wife to Bert Norris. Looks very well and is staying at Heliopolis The husband of the former has gone forward some where, but where he pertaining to the latter may be I do not know, I did not have chance to ask this morning. 
 Three men who have just come from hospital tell of the torpedoeing of a transport off the island of Lemnos, it appears that she was struck by a torpedo and badly injured but that she was able to steam into port. Colonel Linton of 21st or 23rd Battln. and some others were killed. I shall have further converse with them about it. 
 Good night my dears. God bless each of you. Heaps of love and loads of kisses from, your loving and affectionate father [Signed] John B Nash
