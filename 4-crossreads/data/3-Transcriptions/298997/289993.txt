<p>arrived in a pitchy black place known as "The Ravine" which is "supports" in our sector.</p>
<p>Dec 31<br/>The ravine is a deep natural trench in the hill side, which affords wonderful shelter from enemy fire; and naturally lends itself to the making of dugouts, with which its steep sides are perforated.  Unfortunately the mouth of the ravine opens slightly towards the German lines and movement during the day is not approved.  It used to be a German position, &amp; most of the German dugouts are on the side looking towards our present front line.  The officers have these, which are much better than ours.  In one of them is a beautiful enamel stove.  From what is left it appears that the Germans had electric light, an electric pumping system to keep the dug outs drained; &amp; they certainly had proper pegs to hold equipment &amp; shelves for food etc.  I struck what appears to one to be a sort of perpetual motion</p>
