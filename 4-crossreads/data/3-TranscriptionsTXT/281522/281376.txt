9/7/17 BeaulencourtUp betimes and the whole Battalion marched to the rear of Bancourt and there fed into the jumping off positions. This was rottenly done men strolling over the skyline and general mix up which could have been avoided by a little intelligent feeding forward gradually through saps. The 24th Battn were attacking on our left and the 5th Bde on the left of them. We started on a flare signal and worked well on. Umpires regulated the advance according to the situation. After capturing our trenches the 21st. passed on right through and were organized and then re-advanced in artillery formations right through them. After a fierce battle they put the 7th. Bde through us and then called a halt. Reached Camp again at about 4 pm very tired. Hear that Genl Gellibrand has got the 6th. Division and that Paton is coming here in his place. After a fine day it blows up stormy towards evening. Much dispirited to think of Gellibrand going away at this stage.
