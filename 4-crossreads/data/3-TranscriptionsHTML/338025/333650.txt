<p>Monday 2nd April 1917<br/>Grooming "Donks" in the morning and cleaning harness in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Pozieres is the gravestone of as many of our troops as we lost in the whole Gallipoli campaign and what the Australians did there ought to live in the history of this war for ever. The Tommies took the place 3 times and could not hold it under the heavy artillery fire and counter attacks. They brought our Boys all the way from Ypres to get it and they got it, held it, and after five days pushed old Fritz right over the next ridge and old Fritz has never retaken an inch from our boys yet.<br/>Say a man starts once walk from La Boiselle along to Pozieres, he walks on the ruins of shell holes (level ground is unheard of) numbers of them, the graves of unknown soldiers, equipment strewn all over the place, broken stretchers, helmets, bombs and unexploded shells.</p>
