 18/10/17 Pari At 5 o'c I met Ella and we spent quit a long time in convers . At 7 I left to tri and find the Rest . Margeraux renown for it fish but got hopeless lost after much vain voyag in the tube . Ended up at the Caf de la Paix and dine there deriv much amus from watch the old buck with their littl bit of skirt ? bad old devil who ought to know better . The girl are now wear hat a la Americain not at all pretti . Big cigar and power motor seem to character the armi of the U.S.A. The waiter in these Parisian cafe are comic , and veri amus are the overs usual shapeless and podgi with good live . The carv is done by them ? a good carver save much money to the firm .
