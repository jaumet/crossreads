 The names of streets, Kissing St, Kissing Road sounded strange in our ears! But this took the proverbial bun! Outside a shop was a sign:&ndash; "The sympathetic undertaker and contractor" 
 Fruit vendors of all description chipped us! The shops in the way of novelties did a roaring trade, like the postcard ones! 
 How human beings  looked  living in some of the hovels I saw, got s  me beaten! 
 A native girl, about 13 years of age, acted as a guide to my friend and I. She could buy from her kin too! She was our agent so to speak! 
 "Sar, sweet orange Master" was the well worn phrase of the fruit vendor. 
 The native soldiery acting in the capacity of guard round the garrison, was very fine. 
 We spent an interesting time in those few hours ashore. 
 It was just dusk as we formed up again, prior to embarking on the barges again The native band within the garrison struck up and it sounded particularly well too! The Port Melbourne was finally reached again We had spent a pleasant day!
