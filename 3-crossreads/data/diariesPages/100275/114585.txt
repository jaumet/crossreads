of the great charge at Pozeries" I think he is now trying to make amends Some one must have told him some terrible lies about us I would like to find out where it came from.
Another thing I am sure the Colonel noticed himself was a pretty dangerous job I had charge of had to stand up expose myself to a Hellish shell fire that was raging at the time, as he came along he spoke a few words to me, I fancy he remembered this, thought he would do me a good turn.
However there must be something in it somewhere for just imagine me an obscure Lance Corporal jumping over their heads like that.
