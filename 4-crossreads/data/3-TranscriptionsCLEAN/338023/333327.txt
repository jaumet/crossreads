  
 stunt I climbed aboard the Jigger & rocketted down about 1000 yds. of pockmarked slope into a dry water course, then walked abt. five miles for a feed. Since then the sigs. have been swinging the lead sincerely &, beyond an excursion on Saturday night last, nothing doing. The excursion was funny - we occupied a farm house to get out of a storm, the farmer had an idea we'd come to eat his outfit - pacified us with Johnnie Walker! Storm lasted until midnight so we also lasted; But the Bacon, cheese, eggs, J.W. etc failed about 11.30 pm. Luckily we had one of the 'Angels' Corps with us & he paid for the lot. Most Aussi's are in need of Angels now! Let me again mention: you must on no account send anything by registered post - or, in fact, any parcels or papers. We wont get them, so its only waste. I have received   nothing    bar the occasional letters. 
 [The following is written sideways along the margin:] Don't try sending thro any fund etc either - as they're all [this is the end of the writing on this page: continuation on page 132]
