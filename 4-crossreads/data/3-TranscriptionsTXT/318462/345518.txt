Wednesday 24/4/18I was dreaming the Taubes were bombing us when rudely awakened to the effect that it was the Village being bombarded by gas & H.E. shells hadn't much time to think about the matter it was get out 4. a.m. & then outside what a scene, Hell let loose was no name for it. To wake up & walk out into that would upset a good many & it put me out of my reckoning as to where the Trenches were & so I wandered about the fields for nearly a hour with shells bursting all round meI was lying most of the time in furrow I then got up & Tried to find the trench again but got caught in the barbed wire & had a nice time generally till I found it. one big shell fell about 15 yds off & nearly knocked me down by the concussion. When we left the billets had to leave Pack & Blankets, have just returned from getting them & where I was sleeping a shell had come through & buried all my things God only knows what would have happened if I had been there at the time certainly not writing this. Bye the way am writing this to the tune of the battle going on for Amiens but altho fritz got through on the Tommies he has been driven back again Its 10-45 am now & this battle has been going on since 5 the wounded are going by in Ambulances, Waggons, Limbers, & walking A lot of our chaps who were in the Village with me have gone out blind. Last night was the first time I have seen a Village intact bombarded & smashed up. I am not likely to forget Auverne. Still here 1.30 p.m. & nothing to eat since last night all food destroyed by gas. 4. oclock sent for to report to Daours to Cpt Gow 2 kilos Back shells still coming & Fritz advanced a little on Tommy front. Got here about 1/4 to 5 dead beat Went to Div Canteen & got some Salmon & Bott of sauce etc 5 francs. Got dixie of Tea & now
