1916   SUNDAY 18   JUNE
A decent warm day at last. We had no parade at all  The chaplain being very sick there was nobody to take the church service. We sat in the sun & read all day. The convoy have all got into their proper places again. The first instalment of the "Yandoo" the 7th Brigade newspaper came out at 3d per copy. It was not at all bad.
