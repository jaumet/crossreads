<p>In "isolation". Exercise etc. I read Oscar Wilde's "De Profundis". The deep sense of humility which breathes from these pages cannot but impress one favourably. Whatever predilections I may have had regarding the writer, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Perhaps Wilde is somewhat over-individualistic here, but the circumstances of the case partly, at any rate, excuse this. I intend adding a copy to my library when I return to Australia &amp; will also go more deeply into the study of his other works. If all else were worthless, his powerful poetic imagery would tell in the hearts of his readers.</p>
