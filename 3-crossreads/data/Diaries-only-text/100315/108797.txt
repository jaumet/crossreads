19/4/18 ? Lavieville
Awakened for stand to arms but, nothing transpiring, turned in for further sleep. Got up about 10.30 and had a good hot bath which my man Charlesworth had prepared for me. While we were lunching a couple of shells whizzed over and killed a couple just outside so the doctor had to leave. Rodda called in and with him I walked over to his company. There was a little sleety hail or snow falling and I was very glad that all the men had blankets. A good many were fast asleep in their bivouacs
