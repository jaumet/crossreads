 Sunday 11 July 1915 
 Rose at 4.30 a.m.  The stars shone white &amp; as dawn broke across placid surface of the ocean, I felt a new self arise in me &ndash; the morning was so peaceful &amp; majestic, the sun as it rose  through  threw a golden glory over the distant horizon, &amp; finally appeared in a great white disc in all its glittering heat.  A ragged edge of clouds, low down, turned like red hot coals, &amp; the sea between the ship &amp; the distant flaming orb became a molten mass, magnificent in its grandeur &amp; at which the eye could gaze but for a  glimpse  second, so powerful was the sheen.  A new self &ndash; yes, like dead scales the superficialities, the falsities, the habits of life of the world I have left behind seemed for the instant, whilst I gazed upon that awe-inspiring scene, to drop from me.  Romance &amp; a keen observation of beauteous nature engendered &amp; fostered in me from that moment a feeling of love for all things beautiful &amp; serene, and I offered a silent prayer to heaven that I was alive to appreciate  the significance of  the mighty splendour of that glorious sunrise.
