The following is a parody" on "Sing me to Sleep" is a great favorite among the boys
Sing me to sleep, the bullets fall
Let me forget the war all
Damp is my dugout cold is my feet
Nothing but biscuits bully to eat
Far far from Pozeries I want to be
Where German snipers can't pot at me
Think of me crouching where the worms creep
Waiting for shrapnel to sing me to sleep
Refrain
Sing me to sleep where bombs explode
And shrapnel shells are  la mode
Or the sand bags in front of me behind me you'll find
Corpse's in front of you corpses behind
Refrain
