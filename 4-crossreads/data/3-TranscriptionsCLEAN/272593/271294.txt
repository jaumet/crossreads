  
 very serious offence, for they can so easily give the show away & cause a lot of trouble for noise always attracts fire. Funny to say the neutrality ceased tonight for they fired at me while going out to our outposts & they also had a pot at the machine gunners going out, so I had to take the 3rd Batt. relief in a rotten old trench, it was pretty late by the time the last of us got away & we had a long weary march in front of us to Bazentin No 5. Camp  I was just about knocked out by the time we sighted our camp & I simply threw myself down & went to sleep & did not wake up till 10 next morning. We had a good breakfast for there was a lot of parcels waiting for us
