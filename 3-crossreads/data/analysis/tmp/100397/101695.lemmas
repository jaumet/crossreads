 Franc 5th.9.18 . Dear J. For sometim past I have been promis to answer your letter , but up to the present have not done so , though I have littl news to tell you I will make an attempt now . Just at present I 'm have a sort of forc holiday , Thank to fritz and his mustard gas , it noth serious , but veri inconveni , and a bit pain , when I get into action again I ll make the first Hun I get a shot at think that there 's a war on , just to get even , you take my word for it mustard gas is no Bon , and just the sort of stuff that fritz would think of use , It 's a rotten thing to use for it doe not act on your Breath apparatus alon it veri apt to rais blister in other part if you get into a suffici strong concentr , Ive got the blister in other part myself but they are not bad enough to take me away from the Bn . and someon over Fritz side will have to pay the Piper , that is if ani of them wait Late they have shown themselv to be fair good footrunn though a few of them fought well , they had to for the boy were out to get as mani of them as possibl , and they did n't care whether they dead or aliv . I guess it hurt him a bit to lose some of the gun and munit for everyth point to one fact , " That he is get veri short of materi , his cartridg case , are most made of steel ? copper wash to prevent rust , his sand bag are made of veri tough paper . The same materi is use for various other purpos , and there are mani other indic , that he is short of materi , but one cannot help admir the way in which he overcom some of these difficulti There is no get away from the fact that he is clever , from a scientif point of view , but when it come to fight , our fellow have him beaten bad . The Hun do not care to tackl posit held by our men and when our fellow attack , you can bet your life that fritz leav in a hurri onc they get close , or els put up his hand in the good old Kamerad style , I onli wish that we could put half a million men in the field , at onc , I guess they would not stop far short of the German Border , and then the other could carri on . When the Yank start move proper I guess that Wilhelm Co will wish they had n't start out on this campaign . I for one will not be surpris if the German peopl wake up soon and demand peac ? also the head of Ludendorf . for he promis them Pari and a few other trifl and he has fail . for my own part I fanci that he might as well promis them Aussi , he has near as much hope of realiz a dream of that sort .
