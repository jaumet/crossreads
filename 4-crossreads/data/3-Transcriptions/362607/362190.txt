<p>Dear Mum,<br/>Another view of the old Village where we used to march through. Along the road the hawthorn hedges were covered with berries. We used to eat then till we were full   &amp; then throw the rest at one another. We have not been near a village since we arrived here. Dave  &amp;  I have been to the Pictures twice   &amp;  we took Ellis to the play last night but we only go out about 7 at night as we are very busy. Very soon we will be having easier times  &amp;  may get an afternoon off now   &amp;   then. Well, I'm writing a letter so must save some news.    Love Harry</p>
