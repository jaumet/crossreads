Friday, 20 August, 1915In the morning early the enemy put a few Jack Johnsons to the beach but did not do any material damage , they got a few N.Z. with shrapnel, it was a light day for us.  The N.Z. were relieved in the trenches by the Tommies.  Three more of our men were sent away with dysentery etc to-day, a staff sergeant from our other party in Monash's gully with the L.H.Brigade.  when I first came here I found a Turkish Medical Officers Diary and to-day the Col insisted I should hand it in to headqtrs to be translated, I trust I get it back for it is an interesting souvenir, I have obtained a lot of things once the property of Abdul Turk.
Saturday, 21 August, 1915Our gully has been converted into a rest hospital for the men with slight dysentery.  Our tent division are attending them.  The big attack on our left flank commenced to-day & we saw it all from a point of advantage but one of our men was hit in the leg by a sniper, it was his first day up here.  The navy started the ball rolling about 2 p.m with a terrific bombardment on the Turkish ridges on W hill, the din was awful but it was like sweet music to our ears, every shot was a delight, this was followed by a strong infantry bayonet attack but we could not recognize the troops, the Gurkhas & Maoris were there & judging by their smart brand new appearance I think there must have been some of the newly landed 5th Bde.  We also thought we saw cavalry galloping, we know not the official news yet but we hear that they swung around a mile & a half capturing four trenches a few prisoners were brought down after the attack and a lot of our chaps wounded by shrapnel as they advanced
