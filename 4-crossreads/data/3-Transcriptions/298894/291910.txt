<p>the day the time came when our chaps could not go further &amp; retired a short distance.  The Turks seemed to have the range to perfection.  We could see the shrapnel bursting &amp; it caused great havoc  Officers had a bad time several companies being depleted altogether I will never forget Sunday 25th of April.  I really believe it will mark an era in Australian history.  On this day Australians proved themselves.  They landed under heavy fire, a thing rarely attempted &amp; never flinched once &amp; the result was victory.  Our men were deliberately picked for the honour and proved that the trust shown in them was not misplaced.   A captain assured me that 40 &amp;percnt  casualities were spoken of &amp; expected.  Would Kitchener send anyone to such a job?  Just on dusk a cruiser came close to us &amp; heavily bombarded the Turks.  At each broadside our ship quivered &amp; the noise was deafening.  I was in a fuelling boat alongside getting wounded out at the time &amp; twas almost unbearable the shells going almost over our heads &amp; the concussion changed a calm sea into a choppy one causing our boats to rock terribly.  It was  a relief to get on board again.  During the night fitful firing was heard but the main thing was that our artillery was landed &amp; took up there position</p>
<p>Monday 26th  dawned &amp; the battle was still going on but the Turks began to get a little of what our chaps had suffered shrapnel bursting over their lines continuously.  We had still a quantity of rations &amp; ammunition to unload so could not leave for Alexandria</p>
