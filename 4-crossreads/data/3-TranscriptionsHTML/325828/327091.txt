<p>Wal or Ol will probably remember Harold Buckingham from Artarmon.  He is here with me going through the course with me.  He has just had 2 years in France, &amp; is very little altered.<br/>I will let you know, Father dear, of any old S.H.S. Boys in connection with the Honours Board.  I am writing to Lieut R. F. Oakes, No 5 T.S.  A.F.C. Minchinhampton,  Glocestershire, England, himself an old S.H.S Boy.  Perhaps he will be able to let me know of some other boys.<br/>The surroundings to the college are looking beautiful at this time of the year.  We are between 5 and 10 minutes walk from the river (Thames) and my chief recreation here is canoeing.  I did take up rowing at first but then I got on to canoes &amp; found it much more exciting.  About an hour before dinner is about all the time I can spare at present.<br/>Must close now with love to all at home,<br/>Your loving son,<br/>Leo.</p>
