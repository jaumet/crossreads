<p>Re- Hay purchased of Jenkins, Dew Street.</p>
<p>A small rick now partly cut into, was purchased on condition that only that part suitable for horses be taken and paid for.</p>
<p>Another rick at his farm was purchased at the same time, on the supposition that it had been released;  this was evidently a misunderstanding.  I was informed later that the Military had commandeered it.</p>
<p>A sum of &pound;40. was advanced to Mr Jenkins on the two ricks.</p>
<p>My suggestions are, that strong representations should be made to Headquarters (see my correspondence on this subject) and that they should get the Military to release the rick at the farm.</p>
<p>Perhaps remainder of small rick could be used, the best of it could be cut into chaff and 25&percnt; straw added, the poor patches might also be used in the following manner:-  pour boiling water on that amount of hay required for one feed and feed straight away.</p>
