Friday June 9. 1916.I am mess orderly today - along with Gillespie for the first time. There is a route march this morning through the town. The mess orderlies do not go on the march but Gillespie goes on leave in the morning and I go from 11 to 2 p.m.
Albany is a beautiful little town situated on the side of a rocky hill and running right down to the waters edge. The Persic is berthed at the railway pier and there is also a cargo pier running a right angles to it. It is said they are about a mile from the town. I bought a newspaper this morning "The West Australian" dated Tuesday June 6, 1916. and will now eagerly read the war news.
Had a good look round Albany to day. It is a beautiful little town, and the citizens treated us well supplying us with light refreshments with a generous hand and also reading matter. I was ashore from 11 until 2.p.m. and posted letters & post-cards of the town to Willie, Ciss, Lizzie and Tom Douglas. At 9 o'clock
