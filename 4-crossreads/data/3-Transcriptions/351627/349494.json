<p>then it was hot all the time in camp at home, &amp; we arrived here at the end of the winter which is just the same as the beginning of summer at home &amp; it is still hot.</p>

<p>I am the only one from Cargo who has been injured up to the present as far as I know: Did mother send you one of my photos yet? I got a letter from her saying she received them, I intend to be taken again shortly, we are wearing a different uniform here in Egypt, just a khaki shirt, short trousers &amp; puttees, but the others are worn at the front, I mean the ones we went away with.</p>
<p>Will close now as I cannot think of anything more to say.</p>
<p>With love from<br/>Your affec nephew<br/>Norman Sherwin</p>
