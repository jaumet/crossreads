  
 And of a loving  land  friend From recollection ne'er will fade They are cherished to the end. 
 "My Countree, Australia" 
 Oh homeland the fairest And best land to me, What would I only give to be Once more again with thee Away across the ocean's boundless White tipped rolling foam To the land of lands Australia my beloved home 
 I seem to see in fancey The dear old home that I love in the trees the birds are singing As the sun shines bright above On the beach the surf is breaking And the wavelets dance with glee
