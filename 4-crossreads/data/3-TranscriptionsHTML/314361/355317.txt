<p>city. It is a few miles away from camp on the outskirts of Cairo I went into a couple of mosques, the first was that of Sultan Ameer or something like that, the second Sultan Macouk. The sultan Ameer mosque was built 1800 years BC, there is nothing very pretty about it, we went up another tower.<br/>The Sultan Ameer was at one time a very fine place, there is still a good bit of marble there.<br/>I saw also natives spinning a mixture of silk &amp; wool, it was a very primitive method took a few photos. Then I went on through the dead city, but collected such a crowd of natives around us that I returned.<br/>Tuesday Jan 4th 16.<br/>Last night I received a letter from Lou &amp; the Mater. We have had no parade today, for some reason I dont know.<br/>Registered letter to Lou last night.<br/>Saturday Jan 8th 16<br/>Have shifted camp</p>
