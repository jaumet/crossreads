feeling fit well. Have been having a good time in hospital also out of hospital. Weather getting very cold, have to wrap up out of doors. Have been over the cathedral which is very ancient most interesting. Hope to have the good fortune to be able to remain here for Xmas.
Saturday 1 to Saturday 29.12.17
Surprised that I have been allowed to remain here for so long still was extremely pleased to spend Xmas in such a fine place. Marked out for furlough about 20th am now waiting for my papers to come through. Xmas Day was a grand day
