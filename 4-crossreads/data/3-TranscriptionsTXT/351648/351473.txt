 but very precious, I didn't do nearly all the things I should have done (e.g. see the Tower &amp;c., &amp;c.) &amp; did many &amp;c. but London is some city &amp; was looking absolutely beautiful, &amp; I've never seen so many beautiful girls in my life as those first 2 days in London, after that they weren't so beautiful or didn't appear so &ndash; what struck me most was the shortness of the skirts.  Everyone seemed to be about 14, &amp; the daintiness of the feet, ankles (&amp;stockings with legs included) most refreshing I can tell you after service boots &ndash; but I'm particularly susceptible to dainty feet &amp; footwear &ndash; I met many English girls, none of whom can come up to my  imagination  mind to the Australian girls &amp; I'm not petty or small minded or parochial or insular or  small  little Australian or anything like that, its the Dinkum oil &ndash; I met one particularly charming girl though who if she wasn't Lady Somebody I'd feel very tempted to fall in love with, she was the sweetest &amp; most natural girl I've ever seen, simple &amp; unaffected but I don't think she'd do for a Dr's wife in an upcountry town &ndash; why wasn't I born a Duke!.  She's of Scotch descent too, another tremendous recommendation.  I also got my photo taken &amp; will really send you one when they come over. 
 My love to John &amp; Graham &amp; the usual portion to yourself, please continue the good work of writing often.  Best of the best to you, 
 Cheers J.B. Metcalfe
