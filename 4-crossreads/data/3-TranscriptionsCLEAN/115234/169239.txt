 rush 
 Bravely we stormed a Peckham Bus 
 Our objective we gained and our prisoner claimed 
 No wonder Australia is proud of us 
 Have I been wounded in No Man's Land 
 Yes. hit with a bottle just off the Strand 
 Also - I've been in desperate raids 
 Over in Hyde Pk among the maids 
 Our watchword "ave yer got a brief, Digger"
