  
 Thursday 25th April 1917 [1918] Anzac day!  A glorious morning & pretty, soft day following.  Such a day as perhaps we are having "down under" on this 25th April. If only could have gone to the old Cairo Cemetery for the service or All Saints but no hope.  No visits from the medical staff & no trace of Miss More so cannot ask to go out. Hear that my swab is negative again but note from M.O., Capt. Rankin, on paper asking for another to be sent so a wait of 4 days, i.e., Sunday, follows.
