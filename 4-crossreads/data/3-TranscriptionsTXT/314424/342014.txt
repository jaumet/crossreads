 Thursday June 13. 1910. 1409. A fine morning but cloudy. 
 Last night was fairly quiet. 
 Since we came to this camp we have been able to buy fresh cows milk from a Frenchman who passes every morning. He charges 6d a dixie &amp; does a good trade with the troops. I often get some and thoroughly enjoy it. It makes good sap when the bread is steeped in it. We were issued with new shirts &amp; underpants &amp; socks in exchange for dirty ones. Yesterday I did some washing so I have now a clean rig out. 
 [One line of shorthand &ndash; I wrote to my wife this evening.  Letter 132. 3 pages] 
 Friday June 14. 1918. 1410 Cold, cloudy &amp; windy. 
 I finished reading "Chums of the Past Watch" by Harry Campbell, a tale of cadets on board a training ship. 
 This evening I finished reading a detective story by William Le. Lucre entitled "Inspector Whitlock" Bothe these books are short stories, but very interesting &amp; they fill in the long evenings. Today has been very quiet. 
 Saturday June 15. 1918. 1411 A dull cloudy morning but fine. Last night was again quiet. 
 Jack Boon came back a couple of days ago after being away at the Base in a V.D. hospital. It cost him 18 guineas in loss of pay.
