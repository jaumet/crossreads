<p>East &amp; Hodgens &amp; ohs [others].</p>
<p>Saturday 18th December<br/>My sleep was a good one last night notwithstanding I did not appear a welcome visitor in the Sergeants tent in which I had to rest. They tried to crowd me out. After Breakfast I packed up &amp; went back to the Baggage it the Pier. I went to the Canteen &amp; got some tinned fruit etc for the Guard &amp; also got some Beer which I had to manage with a little bit of diplomacy. We fared well in cooking stuff &amp; I had a game of Bridge with the 2nd Batallion Corpl &amp; Corpl Preston &amp; another comrade</p>
<p>Sunday 19th December<br/>It looked overcast to-day and I am dreading any rain. The evacuation still continues and batches of men are arriving from Anzac &amp; Suvla here every day.</p>
