Compilation
===

Use Eclipse, ensure all of the .jar's in lib/ are on the project classpath.


Examples
===

./run nlp.nicta.ner.NamedEntityAnalyser
./run web.reader.WebPageReader
./run web.reader.RSSReader


Task
===

A. Named Entity Extraction

(1) Look at files/article1.txt
(2) Look at NER system: nlp.nicta.ner.NamedEntityAnalyser

    What are named entities?  Why might they be useful in document analysis?
    You don't need to understand how this works, you just need to know how
    call the system to convert Strings of text into a collection of named
    entities.

B. XML Processing for HTML/XHTML

(3) Look at HTML -> XHTML web page parser: web.reader.WebPageReader

    This code converts HTML to XHTML for use with XML tools (e.g., XPath).

(4) Look at util.XMLUtils.PrintNode for printing out XML 
    (this is most everything you need to know to access XML structure,
     understand all details of this method).
     
    To understand how to query for certain XML nodes with XPath, you'll
    do this next in part C. 

C. XML RSS Feed Processing via XML / XPath

(5) Look at XML web page reader: web.reader.RSSReader
(6) Complete methods getLinks() and getNamedEntities() in RSSReader

    The solution is in RSSReader_LabSoln, but please try to complete the
    lab yourself without referring to the solution.  The lab is not graded,
    but understanding all of it will help you with the assignment.

D. Querying Twitter

(7) Run the following code

      twitter4j.examples.search.SearchTweets
      twitter4j.examples.search.ReverseGeoCode    

    Twitter4j is the unofficial library for querying Twitter from Java.
    Twitter4j has very sparse documentation, but if you understand how a query
    is constructed directly from the JavaDoc for the Query class
    
      http://twitter4j.org/en/javadoc/twitter4j/Query.html
    
    and you see a few helpful examples in the twitter4j.examples package
    included in the lab code as well as these examples
    
      http://www.devmanuals.com/tutorials/java/TWITTER4J.html
    
    then you should be able to figure things out for the assignment.  It may
    involve some detective work and Google use on your part -- this is the point 
    of the assignment questions -- I want students to become adept at using new 
    Java libraries they have never used before.  You can ask your friend for the
    answer, but this defeats the purpose.
    
    Start the Twitter question on the assignment and ask Scott any questions during
    the lab.  Ideally, you can finish this assignment question during the lab.
    
    ===
    
    There are more Twitter4j examples on the Twitter4j website and in the release
    distribution, but these mostly explore complex authenticated aspects of accessing
    Twitter, whereas our queries above are simple unauthenticated queries using the
    Twitter Search API.  You do not need this more complex functionality for the
    assignment.
    
E. Other code needed in NLP lab

(8) There are many other NLP classes in this code distribution that will be used in
    Hanna's NLP section of the course.  You might want to take a look at the nlp.opennlp
    package... Hanna will cover what each of these tools does during her section and
    you will use some of them in her assignment.
