<p>5 Monday<br/>A very nice day.  Sea as calm as a mill pond.  Passed a great number of ships during the day.  Boxing &amp; a bit of a concert held forward in afternoon.  Arrived a Gibraltar about 7 pm &amp; anchored outside.  Much interest taken in the extremely large forts &amp; numerous search lights.</p>
<p>6 Tuesday<br/>Coaling operations &amp; taking on water going on all day. Went into harbour about 7 am.  One side of harbour is the enormous fort &amp; on the other is rather mountainous country (Spanish) also the biggest bull-fighting town in spain.  The hills appear to be Fertile &amp; green. Took a few snapshots, also one of H.M.S. "Swiftshure".  Could see some of the guns of the Fort.</p>
<p>7 Wednesday<br/>Sailed from Gibraltar at 7 am.  No convoy.  Spanish coast in sight nearly all day. seems very nice country &amp; very fertile towards the sea.  Direct westerly wind blowing all the evening.  Sea beginning to get rough, (I hope it doesn't).  A bit of a concert held forward.  The zig-zagging course still being taken.</p>
