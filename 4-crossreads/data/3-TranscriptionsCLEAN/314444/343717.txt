Dear Mother & Father,Recieved your very welcome letter. Glad to know you are all well. It is a glorious day today. Exactly like a summer's day in Sydney. It is a grand change after all the rain we have been getting.Ask Doss does she know the Picadilly Restaurant. I have had some lovely dinners there & been to a lot of theatres. So you see I am having a good time. I am still Sgt Caterer & likely to be for some considerable time. Yes it was a touch & go whether they took my leg off or not, all the same I was dead against it & would have let "em" know before they did take it off. At all events it is alright now only for a slight limp, which I think I will always have.Hoping you are all wellBest wishes & loveyour loving sonTom
