Command-line conversion DOC to HTML using libreoffice
$: libreoffice --headless --convert-to html --outdir HTMLs *.doc

NOTE: seems like this is only workng when no opther graphic instances of libreoffice are working. 
Closing all libreoffice documents before conversion, it works.
(btm, no further info about this issue)
