  
 am going to treat as a rumour, not an order. 
 When I get on the move, I'll come to the conclusion that I have started on my trip Home, but not until then. 
 Mar 12th - 19 At last, at last, at last and at last we have left Morialme and have started on our way Home 
 Somehow or other it is very hard to realise but I suppose we will "compre" (understand) in time. 
 Well we arrived at Presles a dirtier and quieter villiage it would be hard to find in Belgium. 
 We had a great send off
