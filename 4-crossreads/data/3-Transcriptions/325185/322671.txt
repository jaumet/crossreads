<p>use one found a mighty hunter in his can among other things.<br/>Another got a tin of blue ointment while I heard some one got half a dozen French letters. In most cases the cans contained the pudding some had a small tin of cocoa &amp; potted meat. Also chocolate &amp; cigarettes also writing paper. They were all very well packed &amp; I can assure you all felt they were very well catered for for Xmas. Then we had curried fowl in the lines also plum pudding. About three o'clock this afternoon beer was issued so many buckets to each company. Needless to say it went to the head of a few of them. Have just been for a walk down the lines noticed a couple that thought they had four legs instead of two. After we had been issued with our billy cans this morning we all had our photo taken. I dare say you shall see it at some of the picture shows later on. If you see troops at Abbassier you will know you have one among the crowd.</p>
