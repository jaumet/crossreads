September 1916

Mills hand Grenades & also threw live bombs. On the 23rd I went through a course of Aeroplane Contact Signalling & learned how to signal to planes & vice-versa. Next morning 24th a Brigade Church Parade was held & General Birdwood & Mr. Fisher were present & the General decorated officers & men with awards which had been recently won & after church parade I went for a hot bath & had a look round the town of Poperinghe which is a fine big place. On the morning of the 20th I was detailed off as advance guard for platoon & left camp at 12.30 pm & marched to reserve trenches which are fitted with electric lights, through Ypres & arrived at trench at 4.30 pm which is on the banks of the Yser Canal & it is a very pretty spot. At night I had to go back towards Ypres to Wood-Cote Farm to meet the platoon & guided them to the dug outs & releived Seventh Battalion. On the way to our destination our path led past the King of Belgium’s summer palace & through the grounds of same. Next day I was put in charge of eight men & was second shift on a mining fatigue & worked six hours on & twelve off but it only last for two days, then on the night of the 28th I was on a carrying fatigue for the No. 1 Canadian Tunneling Company. During the morning of the 29th I went with four other N.C.O’s to have a look round firing line & our front consists of several craters & we hold all of them & it was Fritz who blew them up. The reserve dug outs are in big tunnels
