this morning followed him right to the ground it was not a bad fight the old German deserved his win.
Early this morning Dave Murray I went fossicking about round towards the old wrecked "Tanks" from there we went over to "Guedecourt," I think I saw the most dead men both British German that I have seen in France the ground is just littered with dead men horses, arms legs, heads etc lying all over the place, the worst place is just on the edge of the village they must have had some machine guns hidden there they caught the men as they rushed out of the trench over the road, however the place is a shambles stinks something awful, so we beat a hasty retreat which was just as well for us for a few minutes after we had got away from it they started to shell it heavily with 5.9s We have given them a terrific bombardment
