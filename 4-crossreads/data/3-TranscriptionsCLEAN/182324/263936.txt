 England & I assure you that on each arrival home after a loving meeting with the "best little girl" in the world I go & gaze on my testimonial & "think". It hangs in the room I usually go into first. 
 From this you will think me a sentimental old "Shell back" Well maybe I am but I am glad of it & only hope I shall remain so until I am called away to join the ranks of all the brave fellows who have gone before. 
 Thanking you so much for your letter & looking forward to meeting you on my arrival at Sydney, with kind regards 
 [I remain?] 
 Yours sincerely 
 RH Wynne
