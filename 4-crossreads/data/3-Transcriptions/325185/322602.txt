<p>Will have a fair bit to tell you when we get back again. I received the washing alright thanks.<br/>The coats came in very handy as I was just about on my last clean one.<br/>Can't send to the laundry as our leaving is so uncertain. Don't want to go and leave half my clothes here. We are very well supplied with reading. The Newspaper offices have sent four or five big boxes of old magazines. The library have also sent all their discarded books. We have enough reading to last twelve months. They will be very acceptable to when we get away. I think it was a very good idea whom ever thought of it. All the boats have been supplied the same. Had a fire here last night on an Italian sailing boat. Dident do any damage but it might have done. Dident hear how it started. Carelessness I suppose. It must be a terrible thing a ship on fire at sea. Have no ambition to experience it out of my line altogether. I do hope they will make up their mind soon what we are to do. Either send us away or pay us off one or the other.<br/>Had a letter from Aunty Nell last mail. She said Gran is wonderfully well again can walk</p>
