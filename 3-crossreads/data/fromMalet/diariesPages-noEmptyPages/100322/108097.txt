Edinburgh
There is a solid severity and prosperous sombreness about the look of places here that has its charm. Left at 12.30 in the car for Alloa. Our route took us over lovely green country trim stone walled fields and any amount of splendid green trees. We soon left the outskirts of Edinburgh and the next large place of note was Linlithgow with its old castle. We passed many schools and specially remarkable was the number of red headed youngsters. At Stirling the aspect of the country changed. Its old castle dominates the town a little dour but the aspect of the country changes. Here are high craggy mountains with heads wreathed in mist and emblems of Highland character. We went close to the field of Bannockburn and remarked Wallace's Monument.
