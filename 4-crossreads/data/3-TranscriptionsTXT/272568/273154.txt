[Letter 2, thrown over the fence at Holdsworthy Internment Camp with Letter 1, but by a different author]
[Page 1]
The cause of the trouble!The recreation grounds have been closed on account of two internees attempting to escape.Are 5000 men to suffer for this?Outside the police forbids all the accumulation of the public on account of the influenca, here we are herded into the smallest possible space.Latrine tubs wer not emptied for 5 days. Last night we emptied them into the drainage. Several of us hav been put into jail for doing thisSome men have been put into Sing-Sing probably as suspected ringleaders.          For 9 days we are without bread. We are now consuming what is left in the kitchen, then rations have been refused to us since yesterday.  Today we had only a plate of porridge and some peas.The public should know these facts as soon as possible.
