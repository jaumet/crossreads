 8/8/18 Villers-Bretonneux congested mass of traffic. The crowds of Huns passing comprise all types. Two tank officers walking in front of their tanks were run over &amp; crushed to death this morning. Stewart and others went forward as part of a reconnaissance party up through Warfusee and report all fairly quiet on the front. Our Corps took (it is said) 3600 prisoners today and it looks like very many more being the grand total. The cavalry are said to have captured a train load of reinforcements in one place. Our Transport moved up closer to us but is still too far away. Motor cars are running tonight over what was machine gun swept No Mans Land last evening. All the men are very excited over todays affair. Tanks, aeroplanes, artillery, armoured cars, cavalry &ndash;it has been a full day.
