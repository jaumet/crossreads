<p>BOULOGNE<br/>[21st   Sept. contd]<br/>civilisation on a large scale that I had seen since leaving England in Novr last.  We actually saw an electric tram, gliding along full of humanity &amp; some pretty humanity included  &amp; felt quite at home again.  Passing thro a very fashionable quarter we arrived at the Quay and saw myriads of masts &amp; it was indeed a picture.  Some French sailors &ndash; some pretty visitors &ndash; nurses, wounded boys etc all thrown in made the picture complete.  Next came the ocean itself &amp; what a relief it was after feasting our eyes on desolation.  Quite Manly-like.</p>
<p>Passing the beach we got on the hill on northern side of town &amp; could see miles &amp; miles up the coast and almost to our surprise we could see that in spite of the Huns boasting of 'U' Boats, I could see shipping going on apparently just the same.  The surf was not quite as big as our beaches but showed promise the beach as I remember it not as big as Manly or Coogee.  The surroundings were highly colored &amp; looked like a fair land.  Our car stopped on hill for a while to give us a chance to visit the Exped Canteen &amp; take in the surroundings.</p>
