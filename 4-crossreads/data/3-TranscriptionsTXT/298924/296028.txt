 Saturday 15 February 1919 Gymkhana Well the Gymkhana is over, one works hard to amuse the men &ampl; get little encouragement. We have a Stadium.  Owing to my cold, I am in bed but I can hear the Referee being hooted &amp; the lovely flow of language &ndash; am afraid that Soldiers on their return will not be much of a "brake" on Bolshevism &ndash; our old men are back by this or gone west &amp; we have many youngsters who have not been through the Test. Hear that Bertie Austin was actually at 2nd L.H. Hd. Quarters yesterday but did not see him. Will call if I go Cairo.
