in England elsewhere on cold footed jobs, but they would have no chance of raising that number. Why the other day they took a tally of the original men in this Battalion they totalled 28 including Hqrs Transport. So taking a line from that they will have some difficulty in finding the number at any rate, we who are left, are living in hopes of such a thing coming off, but it seems too good to be true, it could be easily done this winter for there will be very little doing between the end of this month March. The whistles have just blew "lights out" so there must be some enemy planes about. Yes, as I write this I can hear the engines of the Gothas overhead quite plainly.
19th. Fine football match yesterday C. Coy played beat A. by 25 to nil, there was great excitement over it, we had a really good team in the field. Issued the first lot of winter clothing this evening, getting quite nippy now. We were also paid today, there are quite a number stunting tonight.
