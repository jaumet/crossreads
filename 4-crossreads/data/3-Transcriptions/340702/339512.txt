<p>because men were going away after 7 &amp; 8 months. An order has come out to Sandbag all the huts</p>
<p>2.10  The fine weather has now broken up. Slight rain &amp; wind howling a treat.</p>
<p>7/10 Sunday Fritz dropped a terrible lot of Bombs around here last night. There must have been at least one hundred that I heard. The old hut fairly shook. At intervals a shell came from one or other of the two Guns that bombard here. I can't hear the heavy Shell coming. Only the explosion but I can hear the smaller (about 6") one all the way also the report of the Gun. I got a pair of underpants &amp; a shirt yesterday. After a row with the Q.M. &amp; Lieut. Smith. Put sliding light in the Office yesterday. Raining &amp; bitterly cold today. Sent 5 cards &amp; a Handkerchief to Jersey Road. We put the clock back  <strike>8.10 Monday</strike>  one hour last night (Daylight Saving)</p>
<p>8.10 Monday.  A few shells lobbed rather close last night &amp; one of a few others lobbed still closer today. I think the lining of the Gun must be becoming worn causing the shells to drop short. Previously they went over our heads I hope Fritz notices it soon. Weather fine  &amp; Windy. A couple more shells in the field alongside of us, Killed 5 head of cattle. 3 others hit the ration dump &amp; the Hospital both about 200 yds away. Supposed to have killed 25. This is making it rather lively.</p>
