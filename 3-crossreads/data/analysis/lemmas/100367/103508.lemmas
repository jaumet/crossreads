Mac use to sleep on deck in an empti piano case , when the weather was good , and one night some of the lad empti the content of a tin of condens milk all over Mac 's blanket . When Mac went to bunk that night , the milk sweeten his blanket alright , but it did n't sweeten Mac 's temper . No one of cours knew how the milk got into the blanket or how the blanket got into the milk , or how Mac got into both , but be regist under the Pure Food Act it must have stuck to Mac like a mustard plaster to a weezi chest . Mac was annoy , indign , wroth , and challeng the offend , ( whom he thought belong to the Sergeant Quarter ) to make himself known , but the challeng remain unchalleng . He , howev , state that he would report the matter to the Ship 's Adjutant if the culprit did not give himself up within 24 hour . The time of the Armistic slip by , so Mac couch the follow letter of complaint: - Sir , I have to report that dure the night of the 24th . instant . my blanket and myself were the recipi of the content of a tin of condens milk , c , c. The Ship 's Adj . was so amus at the letter that he , unbeknown to Mac , had copi of the letter made to show to his friend .
