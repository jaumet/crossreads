25/9/15  N.B. The Turk, who we regard as a heathen, comes into action with the name of God on his lips in a triumphal shout "Allah! Allah!" Our Christian soldiers go in with shocking oaths and curses. The soldier who goes in praying is one of the things you read about, but never meet. If the dying man can speak he goes out cursing the --- --- and his only regret is inability to tear his injurer to pieces. Badly wounded going to hospital curse all the time. Probably all of the cursing due to nervous excitement the tongue belching out apart from brain control. On the Moslem Sunday (Friday) sounds of their praying reach us but our soldiers' only prayer is the remark as he caresses his bayonet edge. "By --- I hope --- old Abdul gives us a go for it today". Our men good clean swearers compared to English Tommies although their range of swears is far greater. English Tommy's national swear most disgusting but it's constant repetition delights him.
