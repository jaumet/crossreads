<p>St. Andrew's College<br/>University of Sydney<br/>28th June.1916</p>
<p>Dear Judge Ferguson<br/>May I be pardoned for intruding on your feelings at this time to express to you and your family the sincerest sympathy of both the College and myself personally in Arthur's death. In College we had course to look on him as one of the most kindly and loyal of its members, and we had all got to love him as well for these qualities as for that brightness of spirit, which always made him most prominent in creating and promoting the cheerfulness and sympathy of our College life. Our appreciation of him was the highest and the loss we have sustained in our friend makes only more keen our feeling for you and your family in the loss of son and brother.<br/>Yours in sincerest sympathy<br/>Arthur L Campbell</p>
