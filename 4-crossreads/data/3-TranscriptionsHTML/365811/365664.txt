<p>I hope this system of summarily reducing a Judge to the ranks without even a Court Martial will not come into existence, although, possibly it may not affect your particular case, after all, even though they do extend it to cases of incompetence</p>

<p>The Colonel went on leave to Paris this morning so I am in charge of the show. Most of our work consists in shovelling snow off the "Route Nationale". As soon as we have shovelled off all the snow a frost will probably set in and we shall spend the next couple of days chipping the ice off &amp; then it will snow again. At present there is just under a foot of snow on the ground and it is still falling in a soft thick steady manner which suggests that it intends to keep on falling thick &amp; steady for about another 6 or 8 days.</p>
<p>[The following text is written along the left-hand margin]<br/>We spent a splendid New Year's day. Had a lot of the Coy officer's in to dinner &amp; all the others came in afterwards &amp; we had a good old sing song. We possess one of the best piano players I have ever heard; he of course is invaluable,</p>
<p>Best Love to all<br/>Yours affectionately<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
