 14/8/17 Rouen river runs through all.  All the different churches lay round and all the old houses and gardens &ndash; a splendid view.  Descended very puffed and walked to Records office fruitlessly for movement order.  Returning called in once more at St Vincent and studied the stained glass before returning to hotel.  At the wharf crowds of ambulancesdebouching wounded into the hospital ship.  Lunched at the hotel and several families were in at the same time &ndash; all overeating and doing much gesticulation.  Raining a bit afterwards.  The Records people sent round my movement order and some information that my unit has moved on from Campagne to God (&amp;R.T.O's) knows where.  At 2.30 pm paid my bill, ladled out the tips and slid down (per taxi) to the Gare du Rive Gauche and there found a long train and crowds of Tommies embarking on it.  Found a compartment specially branded to my use in chalk and took over there.  Presently and R.T.O came along and told us we might expect to have a 24 hours journey &ndash; that I was OC Train (joyful news) but that a regular draft officer was to be my Adjutant.
