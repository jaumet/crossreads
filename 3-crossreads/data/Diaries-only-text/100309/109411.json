19/6/17 Beaulencourt
Up early but heavy rain came on and delayed our departure. The General came in and waited with us. Letting them put their waterproof sheets over their shoulders we marched out towards Haplincourt Wood and successively by companies launched an attack against that of Villers-au-Flos. About the first time we have ever done a good wood attack and it was very interesting and instructive. Had all the officers out afterwards and discussed the work with them. Marched home and looked forward to an afternoon off but was summoned to a conference at BdeH.Q. and kept there until late.After that routine,details and odds and ends until very late. Never are we busier than when these stunts are pending and for the C.O. the work is never ending. Leon Barbier of Mission francaise stayed to dinner with us and Colonel Craig dropped in for a yarn later on in the evening. Much like his brother.
