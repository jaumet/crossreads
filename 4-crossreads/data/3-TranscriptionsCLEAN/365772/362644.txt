Cairo20.8.15My dearest Sister,I am off to the front again tomorrow with 30 of our old boys who have been wounded & going back so will have another go at our friend the Turk & have a chance of getting my own back for the last three hits they gave me.I am pretty busy fitting the boys up etc., so will have to write a brief note this time dear. I will drop you a line from the boat.Give my love to Ralph & Beres & I hope I pull through this & go back with you again, it is about time my luck changed isnt it.Well dear I will close now with fondest love fromyour loving brotherKen
