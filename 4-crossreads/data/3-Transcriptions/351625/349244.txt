<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>You will wonder what is coming over me lately doing so little writing but I expect you will understand what we are doing when we cant write regularly.  We are both keeping pretty well on it except for me having a bit of a cold &amp; hardly any voice caused through a slight touch of gas which we got the other day.  Things have been a bit lively</p>
