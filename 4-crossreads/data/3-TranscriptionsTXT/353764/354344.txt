Saturday 27/11/15The morning broke a very ideal day.  We first sighted the Albany Coast at 7 am, & we were all pleased that at last we were through the Bight. In all my life I have never seen such delightful scenery which now unfolded itself to our gaze.Mile after mile of Steep Cliffs all grass covered & rising to a height of about 200 ft from the Sea.
We entered Albany Harbour W/Australia at 9.30 am.  Albany is 14 miles up the Harbour.  The whole Course is dotted with small Islands, which gives it a bright appearance.  They have very long Piers here which run out 2 or 3 hundred yards into the water.  We only stayed long enough to put a few cases of contagious Cases ashore & started off again.The scenery all along was very pretty, the whole Coast lines being dotted with Small Islands, which makes navigation very difficult.
We now reached the "Leuwin" where 2 seas meet, & have left the Coast of Australia behind for an indefinite Period.  We were all allotted to Ships Lifeboats, Rafts etc to-day, & started "Fire & Collision" drill in case of accidents.
