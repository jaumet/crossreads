<p>Wednesday 17th Nov. 1915<br/>Passed a very wretched day, Caused through the thoughts of losing my Dear Relations &amp; friends.<br/>After, a very trying time, in which I had to say good bye to all who are most Dear to me, I ran into trouble at the "Camp" where the fellows, most of them intoxicated were fighting among themselves.<br/> However, barring a few sore heads they were none the worse for it.<br/> I have to make this a very Black Day, as I have felt what sorrow is, &amp; I will carry the look of Dear Nina's face with me all through the War.<br/>3 am. Reveille for the March to the Boat.  "H.M.S Persic" (A 34)<br/>Poor old Mum bore up well but felt the strain, also Oss , &amp; Edna.<br/>We are all naturally looking forward to see the ship which is to carry us Away, On! On! to what?  Glory or death</p>
<p>Thursday 18th Nov. 15<br/>We are now on Board!  We left "The Warren" at 4.30 pm &amp; to say a further good-bye to Nina I came on a later Train to Seymours Corner, &amp; then got the Military Car to catch up with the Troop Trans.  We finally arrived at Woomooloo Wharf.  What a Crowd to see us off!  fully 5,000, but what a sad sight, nothing but tears.</p>
