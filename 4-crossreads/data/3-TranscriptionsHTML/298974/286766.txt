<p>I can just imagine the state of our respectable household. I suppose father is the only one who acts like a rational being, unless Bill too, is rational. Perhaps tho', Hazel has a lucid interval occasionally, and the next one that occurs, explain to her that its bad form to show letters written to her to anyone else, for some people cant help letting things out. I'm only joking.</p>
<p>It is now evident that the school will finish on the 18th &amp; we will arrive in Sydney late that evening or early next morning 19th. So that's satisfactory. We have no idea how things are going. The Gov. General, General Foster &amp; some notables were here yesterday, and at one of the College Captains' lectures</p>
