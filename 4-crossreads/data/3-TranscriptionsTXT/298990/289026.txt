Ypres  Salient - between Menin Road & Sanctuary Wood
25/9/16 Snatched 3 hours sleep and at 3 am rose & prepared the Intelligence Report and at 4 left with the C.O. for the firing line, being led by a runner.  It was a raw dark morning and we went across open paddocks to the left of the position  and without the guide would most certainly have been lost. The glare of flares all round us and the rattle of m.g. fire disclosed the position of the trenches.  Owing to gaps in the trenches it is quite easy to walk out by the high road into No Mans Land.  Getting into the trenches roused Main and then walked along finding the men standing to arms and slipping and sliding all over the place on the greasy duckboards.  At places the trenches fall away to breastworks but danger is minimised by the distance across No Mans Land.  Reaching Sanctuary Wood we found it to be a place of the dead and reeking with the stench of corpses.  Shells have smashed every tree and the stumps stand up bare and gaunt like telegraph poles.  The earth through the wood is a shell pitted waste.  Dawn was breaking as we again made back for BHQ and dived into our brick kiln home and had breakfast.  Down below in this tunnel day does not differ from night and candles are going all the time.  Slept until 3 pm in the afternoon and then had dinner.  Blinking from the darkness the dazzling warm sunlight of late afternoon seemed strange.  Went over to "C" Coy and hard a yarn with the remainder of the old hands there.  My dugout here is of the German type, reached by stairs and is shared with the Colonel.  It is a dripping wet place and the water for washing is drawn from the floor under our beds.  The trickle of water continues all night.  Close behind us is a large ornamental lake.  A quiet evening nothing doing.
