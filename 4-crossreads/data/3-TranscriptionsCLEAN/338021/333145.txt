To Lt CousinsA relief is anticipated for tomorrow night. In view of the large amount of material to be moved bring in all guns & material to your dugout. Stack all bulk S.A.A as safe as possible behind dugout, don't forget to camouflage it & let me know the amount. Get all guns, spare parts, condensors etc & 2 belts per gun also into cover at your dug out.
The remainder of the belts & boxes to be brought up here after dusk where it will be dumped & camouflaged, so as to facilitate quick move out as soon as any order comes through. there may be a faint chance of a move out during the night.
