Sun Dec 10th - 16Again a repitition of last night but the wires were left intact, while we were in our dugout thinking some.

Fri Dec 15thIt was my hard luck to get out on a line last night which had been broken by a shell and I put in the best part of the night in mud and snow and it was all I could do to move when I arrived
