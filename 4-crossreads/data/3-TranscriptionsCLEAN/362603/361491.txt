  
 for a row on the River.  It was a perfect day & I had a grand time.  There were 2 other "Ozzie's" and masel'.   All Australians over here are called "Ozzie's."  Well Mum, I am enjoying life as well as I can as you can see, but don't think we forget our Home Folk.  We meet only Homely People & I am quite "on my feet."  I just go when & I like & as often as I like & have a "Home from Home." Give my Regards to the Neighbours & to All enquiring Friends especially Mrs Dobson, Ali & Stephen & the Parks. Best of Love to You All from Harry XXX
