Jan. 6th continued.
Destroyers very active especially about dusk, our escort darting from one side to other for some  mile turning sharp, running with us a few minutes then back to opposite side to repeat operations. At 4 p.m. when this escort came alongside signals were exchanged so close were we that our reply was given by mouth as to number units aboard (1,700 Australian details). Evening on Poop deck singing reading, later making this diary up reading letter writing.
Continued Blk. Diary opp. 25 May.
