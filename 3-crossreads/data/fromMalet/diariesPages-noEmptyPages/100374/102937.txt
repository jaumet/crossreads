are a lot of young English troops who have been over in England training for the last two years.

Naturally being inexperienced in actual warfare they have got the wind up, hence the large number of self inflicted amongst them. Once they have a month or two’s experience they should be all right. Actual warfare is a heavy strain on people especially so on young fellows who have never experienced it.

Aug 12th. Saturday

Had a motor trip of about 60 miles to the infectious hospital near St. Omer. The day being nice and warm I enjoyed the trip immensely.

On arriving back from St Omer I received a parcel from home containing, pancakes, scones, and a tin of Rasp & Red Currant Jam. Enjoyed them very much.

Have got Bunk fitted up in a little hut which has been set apart for the O.T. and D.R. Staff.

Aug 14th> Mon.
King George V passed through in train to-day.

Rumour has it that he made a statement at Etaples, that within a fortnight, there would be something done which would startle the world.

The wild flowers which are growing in the fields and ditches are simply magnificent and I have found great pleasure in studying them.
