<p>83<br/>Yesterday Mr. fd.: asked me how I was, "Pretty well, Thanks Mr. A.":  "Have you been going out lately Frank" &ndash; in tone suggesting inquiry into origin of sore throat.</p>
<p>"No".<br/>"Then  you"ve been saving your money!"<br/>"Just what I haven"t been doing old chap" (hurriedly).<br/>"Can"t you lend us a couple then?"  Ye Gods!!!</p>
<p>Another way.</p>
<p>Make a bet we"ll be finished the war in 6 months:  someone takes it up at 5F.  "Then if you can bet 5F. lend us a couple &ndash; will you old chap?"</p>

<p>Since coming into contact with these Boshes all my sympathy for the owners of the legs in the incinerator - filled with machine gun bullets from the big offensive - has gone.  Materlinck I follow now.</p>
