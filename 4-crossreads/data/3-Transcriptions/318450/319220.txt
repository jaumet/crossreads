<p>We only stayed at this place a short time before getting a move on to our next pace</p>
<p>Our every day work consists of rout marches, bayonet fighting and plenty of drill.</p>
<p>Ever since we got out of the train we could hear the big gun's booming but as we marched further on we could hear them getting louder.  This place is a very busy place in the motor traffic line, as there are strings reaching for miles along the sides of the roads.  We got a move on to our next billet which was about 10 to 12 miles away, and, as it was showery weather it was not to nice to be marching about in.</p>
<p>We reached our next billit in the middle of the day, which was just outside a place by the name of Sailley.</p>
