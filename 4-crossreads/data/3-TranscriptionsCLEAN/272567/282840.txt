  
 22/12/18 Gourdinne away in it. Returned to my billet and had a long talk with the people there about things in general and find myself making quite good progress in the art of French conversation. I figure these people are not unlike the Germans - square headed blonde and with short cropped bristling hair. However they are violently anti Hun in sentiment and tell great tales of the decay of discipline in the German Army towards the end. A very cold black night.
