The postal arrangements are very slack.<br/>I am nearly alright now Liz. expect to be walking in a week with a stick to help, am very good on crutches I had to come down a flight of stairs to reach this writing room.<br/>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am heartily sick &amp; tired of being here &amp; will be glad to get out again, the trenches are preferable to a Hosp. like this one.<br/>Well Lizzie dear I will close now with love to B &amp; R &amp; self From your loving "frere"<br/>Ken</p>
