<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The stained glass windows are crudely beautiful and seem quite to fit the quaint church, while the inscriptions on some of the tombstones inspire a quiet smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now just a brief description of four free days spent mainly in Plymouth, but partly in London.&nbsp; Uncle Isaac was a surprise for though 72 years old he is as full of energy as any youngster, and they tell me that he always starts to run when excited, certainly he ran down to the tram ahead of us.&nbsp; At the house I met &quot;Grandma&quot; as we all called her although she is a Great-grandmother, she is unfortunately deaf, but also very energetic and delights in walking young folk off their feet.&nbsp; We walked around Plymouth town, the Hoe, and the shores, and at one of the places where only the mouth of the Tamar separates Devon from Cornwall, we took a penny ferry across the water so that I could just say that I had been in Cornwall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous to leave and since landing in England very little time could be found for sleep, so you can imagine with what pleasure I retired to a <u>real</u> bed, conscious that no &quot;Reveille&quot; would awaken me at 6/a/m., instead of that I rose at 9 o&#39;clock.&nbsp; After &quot;Mittagsessen&quot; (lunch) Jim Nash and Harold took tram for a thirty mile trip down into Cornwall to a village near the famous Kit H<s>a</s><sup>i</sup>ll.&nbsp; During this trip the train ran along heights bordering the river Tamar and always the panorama was one of very great beauty and large extent.</p>
