and agricultural lands, so that, we had a rare opportunity to study the methods and mannerism of the natives.
Hagiar Kim is a monumental remains of a great temple. Erected by Neolithic man and is in an excellent stage of preservation. The Temple is divided into a series of chambers, walled in by immense slabs of hewn rock. Each chamber contains a rudely formed Altar, and holes are still evident in the walls, to which the animals or creatures to be sacrificed were secured. 
It is a wild imposing place, erected in harmonious surroundings, high on the cliffs and looking out over the sea. Mnaidra was evidently the dwelling palace of the priests and is in a considerably better state of preservation.
We lunched on the cliffs and returned by native garry, a conveyance indigenous to Malta and quite comfortable travelling.
