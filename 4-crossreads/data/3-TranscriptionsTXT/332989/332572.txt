My Dearest Mother.The mails have been very erratic lately and it is sometime since I had a letter from you all.   We are in the thick of it at last.    There is some noise about, just like continuous thunder sometimes.   Tomorrow the 25th is the anniversary of the Australians landing at Anzac but we are a long way from there now.  This is an awfully wet country, seems to do nothing but rain from one weeks end to another, and very cold nights, altho. they say next month will be fine and warn with no rain.
