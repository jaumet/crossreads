<p>have been engaged for some time  that I really must come to her and help her. I have also said that you will help her to write it if she wants help. This does seem to be and awful thing to do but my dear people, God knows we have been parted many weary lonely months and I am quite sure if this letter arrives I shall be able to do something, otherwise God knows when my turn will come. So do all you can and I am sure it will come off. Of course my turn may come before the letter arrives but if so that does not matter I shall say no more but will be anxiously waiting for it. I only hope to God  that I shall not want it.<br/>We are having and awfully busy</p>
