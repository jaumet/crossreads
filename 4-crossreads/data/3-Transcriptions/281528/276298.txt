<p>8/4/18 &ndash; Albert-Amiens Road<br/>The afternoon was quiet.  There were many callers in the way of Artillery and Engineer officers who were making reconnaisances.  Our guns put over a couple of practice barrages towards dark.  "A" Coy moved forward and relieved "C" Coy about 10 p.m.  Sent the ration limbers up to the rear of the support trenches and landed hot food there in much better condition than last night.  Unfortunately no dry sox or any Tommy cookers came to hand.  Rum came and was sent up later.  Walked round the Pioneer Line after dusk and found everyone up there in good spirits but the little bivvies are too</p>
