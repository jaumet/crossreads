<p>Havre<br/>7.1.17<br/>My dear Father &amp; Mother,</p>
<p>Your more than welcome letters of 12th &amp; 14th Novr reached me the day before I left Exeter to return to camp at Salisbury &ndash; You will have heard from Sis that I was suddenly sent for to return to France, consequently the last few days were very broken up. I left Southampton on the 1st inst. and have been hung up here ever since but am probably going on up country tomorrow or next day.</p>
<p>I had a splendid time taken altogether while in England, but was never quite able to shake of a cold, which has fortunately now disappeared. Probably the sea air of Havre has done the trick.</p>
