<p>My dear Father &amp; Mother.<br/>Many thanks for your long letters of 17th October received a few days ago, also Harold of 9th &ndash; That makes a break of a fortnight between the 2 last mails here; whether you posted anything by mail leaving Sydney 11/10/15 I don't know, but that mail was supposed to have foundered. The sheepskin vest has not turned up so far, but I know the 1st Brigade have not received their first instalment of comforts yet, so no doubt it will be along any time now.<br/>The last mail also brought me letters from Mrs Forsyth and Aunt Mary &ndash; which I hope to answer this mail or next.<br/>Yes, that 17th Octr 1914 seems a terribly long way in the dim and distant past. Even 6&frac12; months have passed since I landed here on the Peninsula and at the present rate of progress it looks as though we will put in a fair time here yet. It is rotten to be held up here when we might be doing better elsewhere, but as Kitch put it</p>
