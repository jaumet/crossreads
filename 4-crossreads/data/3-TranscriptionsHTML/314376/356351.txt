<p>40<br/>It was beautiful to sleep there. The climate of the desert is hot and dry. I have heard stated that there are only 2 pints of rain all in a year. Be it so it is a very dry place.</p>
<p>Now comes the part I found very trying. We, as I said previously, had just received orders to embark and go for France.</p>
<p>We set out from Tel-el-Keber at nightfall and were put on to trucks which had been previously used to carry coal. The coal-dust was present in layers and the result was when we lay down to get it all over us.</p>
<p>There was very little sleep to be had. Some of the troops had imbibed freely before leaving and were singing, arguing and quarrelling most of the night. Added to this we were packed together like sardines. I was not a bit sorry when we were put out</p>
