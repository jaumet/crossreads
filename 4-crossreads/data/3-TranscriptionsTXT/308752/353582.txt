I have never seen so many men sea-sick before. Fortunately I was not one of these, but, to tell you the truth, I was not feeling too brisk & if I had moved about, or, if the trip had been a little longer, I would have fallen a victim to the malady. Disembark at Folkstone at 6 p.m. in the good old country again, it does one good to see the place again. I could not help thinking what a wonderful organisation this Leave business is. Here is England at War, & still thousands of men are proceeding, or returning from Leave, per week without mishaps. A really wonderful feat, this proves that England is not in the background yet, & that our Navy is still very wide awake.At 7 p.m. we entrain, & start for the journey to London. What a difference to those military trains in France travelling along on the average of 40 miles an hour & in fine comfortable carriages. Arrived at Victoria Station at 10 p.m., & find the place one mass of people & excitement. The Australians numbering about 400, fall in & we march to our Hd. Qrtrs. at Horseferry Road. This is where the luxuries of Leave begin - here I obtain a hot bath, and a brand new outfit from head to foot.  You can guess that I felt a new man again, after this performance was gone through.  Passes are then stamped, & then at 12 p.m., I was through all the rigmarole, & I was then a free man.
