 May 1917 we had to do the same, except that: 6 seconds after the smoke bomb burst, the "dinkum" gas was turned on, we picked up our rifles &amp; marched through it.  Later on we marched through a gas area without our helmets, just enough being turned on so that we would be able to recognise it  again.  Lastly we marched behind &amp; through a smoke screen.  I had one man in my troop gassed sufficiently to send him to hospital &amp; others it affected slightly. We had the same wind &amp; dust again in the afternoon.  We also saw another of our planes being dragged in.  It was brought down yesterday.  In air fights yesterday 2 of ours were brought down
