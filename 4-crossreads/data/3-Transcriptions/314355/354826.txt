<p>June 3, 4<br/>181.<br/>A letter posted to T.B.C. for Venus Pencils, and James Joyce's "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man".</p>
<p>Early in the day a wind blew clouds across the skies, and all the day they have been passing and passing the sun.  No swimming today and no baking:  the pool deserted.</p>
<p>In the late evening a walk with Ken to St. Marie Cappel, and there in a tiny farmhouse eggs and coffee, Madame a sinister, short and heavy limbed, her sole dressing is a deep print dress and blouse.</p>
<p>Today the Pioneers commence a camouflaging of D.H.Q. Huts, till now half have been half under a battery screen, and the remainder black by the deep hedge have remained innocent of all but rusting paint.</p>
<p>Judging from Aerial photographs, camouflaging &ndash; but the most elaborate, is almost useless.</p>
<p>June 4<br/>182.<br/>Today the winds wasted:  a day of cloudy skies and sudden cold passing winds.  Mail up from the Amb.  Letter from the Commonwealth Bank of &pound;10 standing to my credit, and Francis Edwards' catalogue of "Privately printed editions of Old English Authors", but a cataloguing of books only to be read through:  a letter to her acknowledging the receipt, and asking for the more understood book lists.</p>
<p>8 p.m. and of the instant a sudden drumming of gun fire:  Meteren way probably on our own front.</p>
<p>Posting away Moore's "The Little School" &ndash; George C. going to the Amb. tonight was to take it to Tommy, but in the A.D.M.'s office met Capt. Cato, so he censoring it, post it here.</p>
<p>June 5<br/>183.<br/>(179)<br/>A raiding party of 1 N.C.O. and 10 men of the Australians crawled to an enemy post E. of Le Paradis and rushed it.  The enemy garrison of four men put up a strong resistance:  three were killed, the other ran away.  Owing to the quick appearance of strong enemy reinforcements and heavy M.G. fire it was impossible to search the bodies for identification, but a M.G. was brought in and our party returned without casualties.</p>
<p>Such is the official reporting of the Patrol note 179.</p>
<p>184.<br/>Tom away to Cassel:  a day of little working &ndash; of general lazing.  Mail, two of Bakers Catalogues but rather disappointing.</p>
