<p>Dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>I simply can't write a decent &amp; reasonable letter so you'll have to forgive me for this miserable little letter.</p>
<p>We have had rather a rotten time lately simply fiendish weather &amp; lots of travelling, practically no rest at all &amp; I have been very busy &amp; nearly dilly.  Moving always does upset me &amp; when we have to move in such vile weather its adding insult to injury.  If I started off to tell you all I have thought, I'd never be able to stop &amp; this paper would burn with the language on it.</p>
<p>We have shifted again, "there I was, back at the old Public House again".  Things are still lively.  I don't know</p>
