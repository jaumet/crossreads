<p>17/10/15<br/>Went to bed at 2000 tired</p>
<p>18/10/15<br/>Pitch dark and silent soft rain falling at the stand to arms, evidently been raining during the night, the whole place very sticky with clay mud.  Still raining &amp; cold at the carry on so did not swim but turned in again and slept soundly until 0800 without my boots on &ndash; about the first time I have risked taking them off since being here.  Roused by Mitchell shaved dressed and had two eggs, some toast for breakfast.  Did not inquire where the eggs came from, - trust a soldier servant to forage round.</p>
<p>Quiet this morning.  Our bag was two yesterday &ndash; killed by our snipers in secret post in Tambour.  I dare swear our shells yesterday caused a few funerals among Turks.  I wonder if the mourners chant. "He was the best man ever known" like they do in Egypt.</p>
<p>Letters to hand two from home.  Geo Thwaites says Caddy dead over here.  Today is a typical Australian dull winter's day after rain.</p>
<p>1528  It has been another quiet day -  the big siege battery shells hurtling overhead sound so deliberately plodding away through the air like some big bird with beating wings.  A pause of a few seconds and then a resounding crash and roar as it finds its billet. Large shell landed at top of Gully while talking to Thomsen and we could hear large splinters blowing back crouched into bank until we heard it falling aimlessly into something soft<br/>Bert Curnow in for a talk during afternoon</p>
