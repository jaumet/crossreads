Dear Old Bill.
It was awful just at Dinner Time just as soon as we got into School it came down like anything and the Hale Stones came down like blocks of ice Mr. Collier let us all go out and get some to eat and we had a great time coming home we got a lot.  I get a lot of my sums right.  And I hope that you had a happy Day yesterday and I hope you got that what we sent you.
