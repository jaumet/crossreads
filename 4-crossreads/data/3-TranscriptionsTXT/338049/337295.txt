 Tuesday 26 March Up early for 8.40 train to Balloch then boat up to Loch Lomond calling at various little villages until Inversnaid. A couple of hours to spare so climbed hills instead of having dinner. Great fine views. Good trip but slightly cold. Met Australian Civilian whose views of us were interesting. 
 Home by about 6 p.m. &amp; after much coaxing etc. visited Whist Drive &amp; Dance at Blackfriars Church. Fine gathering. Won the Drive; Prize fountain pen. Thanked people.
