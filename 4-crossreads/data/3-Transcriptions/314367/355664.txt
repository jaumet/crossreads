<p>inboard the Fantome &amp; had Beef &ndash; Mutton Steak ?pudding or pie  - no one could tell &ndash; but we got the meat &amp; some beer - &amp; then I ordered out the Port &amp; Sherry to be put in front of me &amp; sent them round twice &amp; this made a cheery crowd &ndash; cheerier &amp; we had a pleasant evening &amp; all went well &ndash; P &amp; S only cost us (duty free) 3d per glass &amp; it certainly does no harm a couple of wine glasses. At 7 am I leapt from the rails of the Fantome into the ditch &ndash; Dam the sharks. One other officer &amp; I do this every morning &ndash; Of course we go like blazes to the gangway &amp; get on it &ndash; I don't think there's any danger &amp; it is so refreshing to dip in the briny &ndash; Jackson lets all his crew jump over-board daily &amp; I urge Fitz to keep our men fit by swimming &amp; bathing &ndash; The men quote me to their officers "The doctor says it's better than his medicine &ndash; so healthy &ndash; Sir" &ndash;</p>
