32Moderne upstairs & I am whizzed off to their camp at Le Sart, but which they call Brencq. Here the major produces a bottle & cigars & gives me the palliasse off his bed & unlimited number of overcoats I doss quite comfortably for the night
8 January 1919This morning I only wake at 9 am & decide to miss the train at 10.30 & so have breakfast in bed & then have a warm bath with which this private house is fitted, shave & set out for Lille. I had hardly gone very far when the Major overtook me in his car & I got a lift into Lille.
On way in we pass an anchored balloon round which 5 aeroplanes are circling & passed some Algerian troops leading spare horses. Also some french cavalry with spare horses. Their seats are not good & they ride badly.
I then take tram for Roubaix. Each section costs 5 centimes. The tram ticket is marked on top with the hours & on bottom with days of week (letters only). We pass du Romarin, St Mur, Le Buisson (it is not visible) Croise Laroche, Wasquehal, Le Sart, Velodrome, Pere Barbieux, Roubaix where I get out. Nearby is Tourcoing, Leers & Hem but so far the tram has not commenced to run to these localities
