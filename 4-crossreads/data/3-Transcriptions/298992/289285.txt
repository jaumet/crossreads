<p>only child wasn't it?</p>
<p>It is getting very warm up North now, and you notice the difference at once when you leave New Guinea. I am almost shivering tonight, and we are only down as far as Townsville.</p>
<p>Have not sighted any Germans this trip. We had a German passenger for Sydney from Papua, but on arrival at Cairns the Customs Officer &amp; a policeman came on board and asked for me. I was beginning to wonder what I had done. However they only wanted to know if we had any Germans on board. I pointed this chap out, and the straight-away took him to the lock up, no doubt to question him as to his business. We only stayed in Cairns a few hours, so he missed the boat. They don't love the Germans up this way I can tell you.</p>
<p>We called in at Cooktown this time before Cairns, but I did not get a chance to go ashore. I was ashore last</p>
