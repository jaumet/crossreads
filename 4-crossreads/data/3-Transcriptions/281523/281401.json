<p>24/7/17 Beaulincourt &ndash; Aveluy<br/>out near the Butte and marched through Le Sars doing 45 minutes marching to the hour.  The day was hot and their packs dragged.  Halted for lunch outside Pozieres finding it hard to get a decently level place the ground is so shell torn although now grass covered.  Graves, graves and ruin everywhere.  What blood and agony here! Dear old Bert Curnow.  Moved on after a 2 hour halt and made the Ancre where we piled arms and all enjoyed a swim &ndash; laving tired bodies &amp; feet.  Here our guides met us and led us to huts near Aveluy.  Rather pretty surroundings.  Some Huns doing road work under the usual guard of juvenile tommies.  Big dumps and rail sidings about here.  Stewart was expected back today but has not returned yet. Harricks does rather well as A/Adjutant.  The camp was very silent tonight as all were well tired out and not in a mood to get up to mischief.  Some of the lads have fianc&eacute;es at Bouzaincourt but reserve their visits for later</p>
