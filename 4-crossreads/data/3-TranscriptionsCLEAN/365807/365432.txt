  
 In France 29 - v - 17 
 Dear Judge 
 I have a most ripping letter of yours of 29 March last to answer, giving me all the local and interesting news.  I received this since I wrote you last, and have not much news from that date. 
 We have moved from that place up north a bit, and are nearer the Line, though still in billets. I move forward tomorrow with an Advance Party, and the rest follow the day after. Then I think  "we shan't be long" as the old song said. Cannot say I am exactly relishing the prospect and only hope my nerve holds good. 
 I am in the same Division as Keith, and saw him the other day in the distance, but he did not recognise me, and we didn't speak. In this Division are men from all the States, which answers your question, I think, without involving me in any unpleasantness with the Censor.
