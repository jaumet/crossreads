<p>8-2-16<br/>Tue 8th<br/>I have had a pain in my left side since Sunday, &amp; decided to see the Dr. this morning to see if there was anything wrong inside, but it proved to be only a kink probably from football. So I had it paintd with iodine &amp; put on light duties for the day;<br/>The Troop of A Sqd men arrived back from Tierieh this afternoon, &amp; said they had a very good time there; Some reinforcements arrived today to take the place of men who are still away sick, Matheson &amp; Treasure amongst them; A good many lads are blithered tonight; Cpt. Lindsay received leave of absence for 4 days to meet his father who is on his way from England to Australia; Lindsay left here last night</p>
