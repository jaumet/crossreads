2-3-16Thurs 2ndPut in this morning taking over Signalling Equipment from Nelson;This morning an English Tommy was accidentally shot (at Sequela) by a machine gun, the bullets went through both legs above the knees & he died while being bought to the train at Sandafa; Capt. Wells had to go down to attend to him.
Captain Higginson appears to have sobered up for the first time since we have been here, & celebrated the occassion by saying everything has to be done much stricter, & is getting himself well disliked in consequence but I suppose it will only last for a few days; Reid goes on the 'phone with Head Quarters Sigs tonight & we do no more patrol work for some time at anyrate.
