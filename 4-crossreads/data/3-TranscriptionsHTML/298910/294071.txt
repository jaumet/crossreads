Each waggon took 30 men &ndash; we passed through Flexicourt, Pequigny, Amiens, we got out on the outskirts of Albert &amp; walked about 9 miles &ndash; here we were within the sounds of the guns again &ndash; They are pushing on with a new Railway line as far as possible so as to assist in the conveyance of material etc &ndash; the Red Cross train runs up near Albert. It started to freeze again about 4 pm &ndash; We got &frac12; pint of tea, which was cold when it reached us &amp; had to sleep under a canvas awning &ndash; the ground was wet &amp; cold &amp; frozen.</p>
