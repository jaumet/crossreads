<p>Saturday March 3rd<br/>There were three convoys in last night, but we only received six patients out of the three. Looks very much like rain this morning. Three <strike>of the</strike> chaps out of this unit left here this morning to go back to Australia on transport duties (lucky beggars). Getting more used to the job, also the women.</p>
<p>Sunday March 4th<br/>Snowed pretty heavy during the night, but as it was fairly warm, &amp; rained slightly during the day it was soon thawed. The weather was very cold all day. Went down into Boulonge during the afternoon with another chap out of the tent. Had rather an enjoyable time. As the pay office was shut I will now have to wait till Wednesday for my new pay book.</p>
<p>Monday March 5th<br/>We only had twelve patients in all day. Most of the cases that come here are sent over to England as soon as they are fit to travel. We have forty six beds in our ward. Not feeling too good, my arm where I was enoculated for anti-tetanus is very itchy &amp; aching.</p>
<p>Tuesday March 6th<br/>I seem to be getting "some boy" with the sisters here, they will do anything for me. I have nearly all my meals up in the ward now, a fellow can score some chicken &amp; pudding there occasionaly. Still feeling pretty crook. Went of at 6 pm as it was my early afternoon off. <strike>Shifted from the tent into a hut this evening, we have beds</strike></p>
