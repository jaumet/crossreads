 19 July 1918 Friday (X to X crossed out) Marched out at 7.30 pm or 1930 as an ARMY has it-   I am in command of the Regt as the Colonel is temporary Brigadier- X Gen Sir H. Chauvel spoke to the men, &amp; I was sorry he took the line he did the men were "just at the end of their tether" &amp; he slated them re Saluting Discipline etc poor boys they stood in the heat &amp; nearly dropped-  of course he patted them on the back also-X   but  Many are still going sick &amp; from Shell Shock-  I lost many good solid old warriors-  Passed Bethany, Jerusalem in the Moonlight again &amp; also Bethlehem.
