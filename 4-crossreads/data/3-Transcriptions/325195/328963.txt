<p>5.10.15<br/>Tues 5th<br/>A sea-plane has been busy the last few days flying over us, also aeroplanes have been showing out very consistant: &amp; the Taubes seem to be just as busy but the pilots of  both aeroplanes do not seem too anxious to clash; I have been on to Nelson on several occasions now to speak for the sand bags I want, but they have not come to light yet. Had a dip this afternoon: The war-boats still keep up a heavy fire at intervals during both day &amp; night; Last night about 70 Turks were sighted in front of the 3rd L.H.R. a special patrol was sent out to try &amp; find out what their game was. it was supposed they were out after our patrol as they were seen &amp; fired on  the night before, no casualties</p>
