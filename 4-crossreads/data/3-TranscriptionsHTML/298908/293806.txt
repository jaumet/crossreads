<p>After dinner I went down town to do a little business got my watch repaired &amp; some films <strike>del</strike> developed &amp; then went &amp; had a bonzer hot bath which cost me the huge sum of 3d.  I then struck out home for tea &amp; to attend to the rest of my duties.  It has been another glorious day with the sun shining from sunrise till sunset.</p>
<p>18th.  4 years today since leaving "Aussie" &amp; to me it seems like 20, but thank goodness we are on our way back.<br/>Has been raining lightly all the day but this has not stopped anyone from going out.  I had a run into Plymouth this evening &amp; had a look round the town she is much bigger than Devonport but both towns are practically the same &amp; they are connected by tram &amp; train &amp; ferry as well so the services are pretty good.</p>
<p>19th.  Got our clothing &amp; pay this morning both articles being very welcome.  I'll bet there will be some fun in the town when the mob get down with their "Bradburys".</p>
