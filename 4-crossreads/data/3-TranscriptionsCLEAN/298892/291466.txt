success in civil life that I ever would.We are a very happy community here - just like school boys. There are no grumblers in our tent thank Goodness, and very few, if any, in the camp. Of course we all have our little jokes at the food but they help our appreciation of it. All new men when they first come into camp are called Marmalades - as that is the usual jam.I have everything I could possibly require in the way of clothes & money. In fact I am very sorry now that I did not leave more of both of them at home. The money is safe as I invested in a money belt and wear it constantly. I have left my port containing most of my clothes at Sharpe's and will take more of them in this week-end. We are allowed from 12 noon on Saturday till 12 noon on Sunday off but I intend applying for an extention till Monday morning.I purchased a small green wicker suit case for my clothes in camp.

In its leaves is a needle threader. The point of the wire is to be pushed through the eye of the needle, the cotton threaded through it, and then pulled through the needle. I hope it may prove useful for the machine and not like many new inventions, more trouble than the old method.Your loving sonEugene
