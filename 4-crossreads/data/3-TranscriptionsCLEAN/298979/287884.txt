  
 position was found within a few yards where a hastily dug trench just wide enough to stand up in & just deep enough to be lower than the top of the bank in front, enabled the men to have a "look round" & take stock of the conditions. 
 The firing that had forced the men out of the sunken road to where they were, was found to be coming from a party of Huns on the right of that sector.
