<p>My dearest Mother   &amp;  Sisters.</p>
<p>Am thankful to be once more able to write to you. We have had an awful time   &amp;  are now without a home. We are in a safe spot   &amp;  a nice little village, scattered about in three different hospitals. Dorothy, Annie Bell   &amp;  I with five other sisters are here   &amp;  the others are not far away. We are waiting orders, not on duty, so had a good rest yesterday   &amp;  today have been out amongst the shops, buying boots etc. We all felt tired out but begin to feel quite well again. May all get our leave but can not tell/ Things here too awful where we were &ndash; Fortunately none of our Sisters got wounded not killed. But we had a Medical Officer   &amp;  orderly  killed the other night &ndash; which made us all very</p>
