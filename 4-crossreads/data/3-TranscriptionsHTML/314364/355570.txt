<p>Friday. March 21<br/>We tipped all our Guests out of Bibby's Hotel today, so that we can get the paint cleaned up. The S.M.O. says we can continue to have our have our meals &amp; sleep there. The Head Sister doesn't like the idea of it. Poor woman, I'm afraid her liver is not too good. It is pretty rough, &amp; our old Boat is rocking some. I finished off my letter to B.E. but it's not much use posting it in Hobart.</p>
<p>Arrived Hobart Sat. Mar 22<br/>This morning we went out on Deck &amp; found ourselves anchored in a very pretty little Bay. The surrounding country was very pretty. We appear to be miles away from anywhere.<br/>When I was in France we used to joke about coming Home, &amp; say that by the time we reached Home the people would be so sick of the sight of returned soldiers that they would take us round all the Back Streets, &amp; now, owing to the confounded [indecipherable] that's just what they are doing. One Tasmanian went ashore in a Launch, we took some supplies aboard &amp; sailed away for Melbourne about 3 p.m.<br/>We are due in Melbourne on Monday morning.<br/>Owing to a few words we had with the Head Sister Bibby's Hotel closed today.</p>
