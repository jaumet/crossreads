Paris
13/3/17
For the last time trotted into Arrigonis and had the usual Chianti which is always excellent. Loud voiced American egoist with his little bit of skirt wanted to know how things were in Canada. Returned to hotel and after some more stupidity left at 10.45. E. in a little evening blouse and awfully sweet and nice. Took taxi to Gare du Nord (fare to Amiens first class 3 francs) and an English Tommy procured seat until the stimulus of a tip. Indeed last moments in Paris were all tips ? valet, femme de chambre, liftman, porter and boy. Will always look back on this little stay with feelings of great pleasure.
Travelling companions were French officers and civilians and most of us were snoring loudly by the time the train pulled out. The run to Amiens was a nonstop and quite pleasant. Slept nearly all the while ? the carriage very warm on account of the heaters which are well poked up at each halt by the railway staff. A fine dark night.
