Coy the worst.You can see quite plainly our observation balloon's up from here especially of an eveningOut again this afternoon, the boys were in a bad humour  & so was the Captain so things were anything but pleasant the boy's don't like the idea of the two parade's daily & are kicking a bit over it, I can see some fun shortly if the parades are continuedOur Colonel has gone to the trenches today to have a look at thingsThis evening 2 other chaps & myself went over to the Flying Corp's
