2nd Feb. Wed. 1916.
I sent the signallers out this morning on some long distance work. The furthest station went out about 8 miles There was three Helio stations out forming one large triangle about 8 miles apart. This is best because the light from a 5 inch Heliograph is too severe at shorter range. I went out on a long ride myself inspecting the various points. The sentries on the Staff lines last night "pinched" 6 out of our 10 nosebags which is too bad I recovered 4 of them this morning in A Squadron lines after much argument. However they are well branded and today Parrish has been employed in putting a wide green band with paint around each nose bags as a sure mark of identification
