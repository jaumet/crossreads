  
 April, 1915 Monday 19 Field day on the old Suez Road after went Pay Office Cairo - Tomorrow we go on the promised 8 days trek to Saccora & Memphis - the old Capital Weather warmer & all Egypt goes to sleep midday, except we soldiers who train all day in the European fashion or should I say English. Myra Nyse better, she had a close shave, & is still very weak. My "Mufti" is still at the Pay Office & I will not send it till we move.
