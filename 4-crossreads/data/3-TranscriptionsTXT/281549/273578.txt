 We passed a 3 masted Barque soon after we had started, She was making straight for the seat of the accident, Those on board her would most likely see the lighted bouys that we left behind in the water. We are drawing near to the trade Route now steamers &amp; sailing vessels have been seen often during the day. Another lifebelt &amp; Boat Drill Parade again to-day. 
 November 12th Sunday To-day I was put on guard over the Water tap &amp; Sergeants Mess Cookhouse. 
 Nov.13th Monday This morning I finished my turn of Guard at 9am  Last night at about 4am we passed a small Island &amp; it appeared to be very thickly wooded &amp; very fertile. A remarkable thing about this guard was that 13 men of  the 13th Battallion were on it &amp; that it was also the  13th of the month. If the number 13 is an unlucky number it looks as if we were in for a good share of bad luck.
