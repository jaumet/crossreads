June 1915fairly hot & the water too tempting.  It is a pity that the water is so exposed to snipers.  Was on Q'Masters fatigue at 8pm.
Friday 25thPut in some pretty hard pick & shovel work at the new communication trenches.
Saturday 26thHad a fairly easy day only 4 hrs on the pick & shovel.
Sunday 27thWas on water fatigue.  It is a fairly strenuous job this hot weather as we have a full mile to go for it & a good portion of the track is through sand.  Got letters from mother & cousin Meg, also from Frank & Doug.
Monday 28thVery hot day. We had to stand to arms at 12 o'clock.  About 12.30 portion of our Brigade attacked the Turks on the right & occupied the Balkan Gun Pits.  It was fairly lively.  The 5th had a good few casualties mostly wounded slightly.  However
