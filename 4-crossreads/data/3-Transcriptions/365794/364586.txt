<p>Wednesday 4 [3] July 1917 [1918]<br/>Busy day as 6 pts. go out &amp; we straighten up the ward gradually.  Fights go on always as regards food &amp; it is very poor.  Bread &amp; dripping L.A.S. sour puddings, "high" meat sometimes is making our boys desperate &amp; I fear an attack on the "bull ring" as the D. Hall is called.</p>
