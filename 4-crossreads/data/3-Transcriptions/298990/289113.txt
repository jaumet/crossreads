<p>Ribemont  20/12/16  Great bustle and stir early as all packs had to be dumped before 7.30.  After breakfast went out into the street which presented a very busy scene with activity.  Moved off at 8.30 as a brigade with intervals between the units and companies.  Snow still lying on the ground but the day was sunny and pleasant.  Had an excellent march to Fricourt the roads so busy last time were comparatively free of traffic and the troops marched well all in their steel helmets and fighting order.  We had a couple of halts on clear ground and when we came abreast of Fanny Durack of Albert we began to realise that we were again entering the territory wrested from the enemy.  It is interesting to see the two original opposing sets of trenches and then the succeeding positions which were occupied and fought for.  Coming to Fricourt we formed mass on a clear space flanking the huts on ground usually a bog but now completely frozen solid.  The 18th were still in the huts and I found Colonel Murphy there.  We foregathered and discussed old times until he moved off at 2pm. Also saw Col. McKenzie of 19th and got some furphies about things in general.  Spent the afternoon settling down, tried some cases at Orderly Room.  Very cold today.  Stewart far from well and M.O. sent him to hospital in the evening and I put Cawthorne on the job in his place.  We soon get comfortable in these huts they are good.</p>
