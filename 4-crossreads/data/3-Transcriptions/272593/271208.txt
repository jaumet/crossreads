<p>for the country round about here is as level as a billiard table &amp; there is nothing to distinguish your direction by for it is all alike &amp; you can easily be walking in a circle, as other parties have done before today but my bush training stuck to me &amp; I came out as straight as an arrow, by this time the whole party were completely knocked up for it was pretty stiff work &amp; we had just come out of the firing line, &amp; their feet were all swollen &amp; painful, it was a shame to send them out at all, but then you know the old military style. Shortly after this the remainder of the Coy. came in from the firing line &amp; we had tea &amp; went to bed, after oiling &amp; washing our feet in Condy's. <br/>There was also a very welcome mail came in tonight.</p>
