3 - gone. Poor man - you will sympathise with him.I had a long letter from Edith from Lemons, of course I am very depressed about Willie and his affairs - but am more than thankful about his being a tea totaler. I do wish Gibson was.I feel infinitely sad about it all - death is nothing compared to these living horrors and failures & disappointments.When I look back on the Great loss of Willie Owen's death - and think of all that has had to be faced since. - It's just like one horrid nightmare. One feels cowardly sometimes and feels as if one has had enough. I wonder if death brings forgetfulness and puts you outside the suffering of your dear ones failures - and disappointment? What a morbid horrid letter. I'll stop writing. I have not heard from you this mail. I'm glad Constance got home safely with her darling babes. Much love to her and Ernest when you see them. I'm glad they are alright. I wrote to Bill last mail but have not I think time this to write but will if I can. I received Lady Stuart's pictures & just love having them. I will write & thank her - at once.
