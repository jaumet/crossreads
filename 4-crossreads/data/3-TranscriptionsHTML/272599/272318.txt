<p>Feb. Sunday 18 1917</p>
<p>A quiet night last night, only one case &amp; mumps through, kept him till morning. <br/>'Twas one of the darkest nights I've ever experienced - a thick fog with rain added to the blackness.  <br/>With 2 others I go back to the R A. P. Factory corner in the morning.  <br/>Several get sick here, the damp; smelly dugout is responsible I think. There's about 6 inches of mud on the floor from the dripping roof.</p>
