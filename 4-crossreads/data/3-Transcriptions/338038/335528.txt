<p>Dear Mr Garling<br/>I arrived home invalided with the last batch of wounded &amp; I think perhaps you might like to hear from me.  I had the great pleasure &amp; I say without any exaggeration &ndash; honour, to belong to your son's Battery.  We were great pals having belonged to the first Australian Division.  I loved Terence more than I could have loved a brother &amp; like everybody else who came in contact with him admired his splendid manliness.<br/>The Major 'Terence' was about three yards in front of me when a 4.2 high explosive shell burst just near &amp; a fragment struck him about halfway between the knee &amp; hip in front of his left leg.  It made a hole about the size of penny.  I assisted to bandage him up &amp; had just finished &amp; was talking to him when a shell landed close by &amp; I was wounded in the stomach.  We were both taken to the Casualty C.S. together at Heningcourt where our wounds were dressed.  I became unconscious &amp; on coming round found myself in a schoolroom at Warloy &ndash; about 3 miles from Heningcourt.  Terence was lying on a stretcher just near me.  I noticed that they had just operated on him.  He did not seem to suffer any pain from his wound.</p>
