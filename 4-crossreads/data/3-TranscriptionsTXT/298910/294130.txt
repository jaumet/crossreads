Sunday  8th 1917
Nice sunny day. Church of England had a compulsory church parade - No R.C. Services offering - Rigging Tents etc., anything but a rest. Fortunately for us the stunt was postponed & we were not called out. On parade the Adjutant asked for the names of our squad who stuck to our post - I daresay that is all we will hear of it.

Very cold - rain & snow. Squaring up Tents etc all day. At 11.30 pm we the Bearers were - pulled out - pulled down enough tents for one Section, ordered to be in readiness to move off & assist at some part of the line.
