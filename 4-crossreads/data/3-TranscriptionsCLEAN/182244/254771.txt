made it the Capital of Egypt
Yet Memphis & Cairo held pride of place for the most part.
Alexandria a City by the sea with its flotsam & jetsam from Maratime Countries.
Cairo an inland City.
No beggars in Alexandria.
The foreigner in Uniform or Mufti goes unmolested by day and night
A well policed City.
