 &nbsp;&nbsp; It has meant hard work for us all, it has meant much danger too, but comparatively speaking our casualties have been light, and though others who have shown to the enemy a front less bold, who were less daring in their seizure of positions of vantage, have paid heavily, our cost has been much less beacuse of our strength.

 Sincerely yours,
