<p>them still remain, they prepared the way for the single God under whose aegis we live.   To sleep for but few minutes, thereafter to resume this and start other letters.   Good night.</p>
<p>29.7.15.   9 p.m.   Did not wake in time to write more before retiring therefore had the sheet to wait for more letters to be impressed upon it till to night.  Here they are in response to the striking of the keys, not must be admitted, in my case, entirely successful as to coresstness of shooting by each and every finger, however it is of my best, and in view of the limited training in an old age it must suffice.</p>
<p>God bless the cows of the Bernese Alps!!!!   So say Jerome and I.   God bless the cows of the Bernese Alps!!!!! Because we have discovered that the milk they yeild is put up in tins, which carried across the Mediterranean Sea is to be purchased here.  Why the flavour and the colour remind one of real Australian cows milk, I consume a tin of it at each meal as a drink and otherwise, the discovery was made accidentally, when the store had run out of the ordinary thick condensed milk.   Hurrah!  Hurrah!!!!!  I am still eating too much at each meal; continuing fat will soon commence to form round my other tissues, and my proportions shall be as formerly.</p>
<p>Two gentlemen are bidden to lunch with me on Sunday, jerom says that he will feed them well, he knows how to do it, and we have plenty of food wherewith to make a splash, drinkeables may not be in large variety but they will suffice.  I shall tell you of the feast later.</p>
<p>Daily we expect a mail from Australia, but when it will arrive is not known to any of us.   We hope.  Some day our hope will be gratified.</p>
<p>My 610 patients have been giving me some trouble to day, the sequel to which was that they got no cigarettes to night, a packet had been promised to each, but at the last minute I refused to have a distribution.   As there is nothing in the world they desire so much as tobacco of some kind the dissappointment was very great however I was not sufficiently recovered from my annoyance to give way.  The gamblers as well as the smokers desire cigarettes because the paper filled with tobacco is a common medium for exchange across the blanket which serves as a table, when the hands are filled with the prised material the gambling is fast and furious.   There is of course a group who gamble on a higher scale, they have money, and look with a sort of benign pity upon the humble man who plays but for cigarettes.  Such is the way with the soldier as with greater folk, and so 'tis like to be till the end of time.</p>
