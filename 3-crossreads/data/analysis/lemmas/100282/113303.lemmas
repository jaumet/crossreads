 there were stretcher Red Cross car all over the place , we had 4 casual in our Battalion , one bomb drop almost on the dump about 40 yard from our hut , caught the chap who were at the latrin , also kill 2 tommi , so much for drill in sight of the plane in the "forward area " this might teach those in author a lesson but I doubt it . They are hold a voluntari R.C. C. of E. parad this morn . This afternoon I found out where the 12th Battalion were camp , over in Ypres in the Belgian Barrack , so I went over to see Stan , strang to say I had a dread of enquir for him , someth seem to tell me that I would hear bad news , I was not veri far out , you can imagin what kind of a shock I got when they told me he had been kill , the world seem to stand still for a few sec , I near fell , but I recov my balanc forc myself to keep quiet . Georg Vaughan must have heard someon enquir
