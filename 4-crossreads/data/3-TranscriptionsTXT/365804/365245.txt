 At Sea One day of many 
 My dearest Sister. It will no doubt cause you much sorrow to learn that I have not been sea-sick and that I have no intention of being so. Furthermore I have not had the pleasure of beholding anyone in the throes of mal-de-mer so that I cannot provide you with any gruesome details regarding this interesting malady. 
 Since writing to mother and father &ndash; which took place yesterday &ndash; several interesting and exciting things have happened of which I am not allowed to tell. The consequences may be serious or they may not, but once we get off this confounded troop-ship, I'll write and let you know all about it. 
 Today is Sunday; and this morning we held a memorial service for Lord Kitchener. News of his death reached us by wireless two days ago, but as yet we know no further details than that he was drowned.
