Stables at 6.In the morning I as usual acted as cook & made porridge.  I'm getting real proficient at the act.  Another batch of letters arrive but none for me. I must be satisfied at mine.  Mackworth arrived & called his scheme through.  I stayed in camp & tried to fix up my motor during the day the appeal was returned & now the motor is going to sent into Cairo to be repaired. The afternoon was a holiday for all hands most of the men went on leave, but I wrote letters Fletcher went to Hebron & left us in the lurch for stables.  Bert Masters went to his lodge last night & had a royal time the people could not do enough for him.  After tea I went for a stroll along the Nile with Bobby [indecipherable] then returned about 9.15 & turned in.
