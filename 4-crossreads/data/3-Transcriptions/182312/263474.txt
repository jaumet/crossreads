<p>such as a heap of old trench mortar bombs on the side of a sap or</p>
<p>the remains of an old French farming cart which had been in No</p>
<p>Mans Land in front of us.&nbsp; By means of these guides we were able</p>
<p>to locate the trenches which we had occupied and out of which we</p>
<p>attaacked on 28th July.&nbsp; Not much of the trenches remain now and by</p>
<p>the time spring comes they will be entirely obliterated and over all</p>
<p>will be a growth of grass and field flowers.&nbsp; Nature is a wonderful</p>
<p>repairs-contractor.&nbsp; Woods such as Delville Wood, High Wood,</p>
<p>Fricourt Wood, Bazantin Wood, etc. which now are only represented</p>
<p>by stumps and blasted undergrowth will be leafy glades of the</p>
<p>Christmas card variety in a month or two and shell holes of earlier</p>
<p>days will be overgrown with yellow charlock like so many golden</p>
<p>fairy rings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the battle line moves on so do the names given by</p>
<p>the soldiers to the various trenches, saps, sunken roads, etc.</p>
<p>In many cases the old notice boards are carted along and put up in</p>
<p>new positions.&nbsp; The monotony of the names is appalling.&nbsp; When</p>
<p>they are not called Piccadilly, they are Leicester Square, and</p>
<p>if by some miracle they are neither it is an eighteen pounder to</p>
<p>a tin helmet that they are Shaftesbury Avenue.&nbsp; Occasionally a</p>
<p>bit of variety in nomenclature is found where some troops other</p>
<p>than Londoners have been in first possession.&nbsp; Thus the East of Scotland might be identified by such names as x Princes St.,</p>
<p>Carlton Square, William St., etc., whilst the Glasgow men would</p>
<p>christen their spots Sanciehall St., St. George&#39;s Square, etc.</p>
<p>Australiaxx never had much chance to identify herself with the</p>
<p>custom of name giving as we generally occupied trenches which</p>
<p>had already received the necessary attention.&nbsp; One typical</p>
<p>Australian name only I remember and that was at the intersectio n</p>
