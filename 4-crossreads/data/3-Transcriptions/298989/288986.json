<p>15/2/16<br/>A windy sky and later very cloudy. A light rain commenced about lunch time. Busy with Court Martials all day, prosecuted in four cases. Major Harris 21st the President. Curnow's parcel of photos arrived and sent a few home. Things quiet. Kirkwood "C" Co. a little weedy chap who was wounded in the trenches has rejoined. The circumstances of his wound were very funny. He was one of a party putting out barbed wire and suddenly he was hit by a bullet in a very delicate place. Clasping it he tore back towards the parapet and floundered into a heap of barbed wire. It was pitch dark but he got out somehow and raced over into the fire trench, then tore down to the dressing station to get it dressed.</p>
<p>16/2/16<br/>A fine windy day. Great furphies about forming new units and C.O. asked to submit recommendation for appointments there. Brigadier has sent my name on for staff work, am trying to get it withdrawn. Rumoured that 3 new Divisions are forming 1 in Australia and 2 at Tel el Kebir. Rather a coincidence that 606 is the regimental number of one of our company clerks Lance Sergt. Glasscock of "C" Coy. The proposal re units seems to be to split them into two half the senior officers to go to one and half to another. Interviewed Brigadier and told him I did not want to go on to Staff job but wanted to handle the men not the orders. He promised to explain same to Divn.H.Q.</p>
<p>70 bags of mail arrived on camels for the Brigade. Attached they have 3 of the Indian Camel Corps men under Bekanees. Our picquets were again shifted today this time to a place further forward. Barbed wire and range marks &amp;c being still put out. Had hoped to start a company on bayonet fighting tomorrow but Engineers now want a fatigue of 100 for road building purposes. Two good fights this afternoon and a "straight pull" two out of three for a side wager. Good sport and men all interested. Bed.</p>
