<p>Sunday 18<br/>The last day. This morning round the parks, Row, Palaces &amp; Oxford Street. A fine walk on Sunday morn. This afternoon &amp; evening to Richmond &amp; along the Thames with Miss Starkie.  A beautiful night with many searchlights &amp; reflections on the river.</p>
<p>Monday 19<br/>At Bolougne. Leave Victoria Street at 7.50 on a Pullman Dining Car &amp; breakfast on journey. Beautiful ride. In a rest camp at Folkstone for a few hours and after a very stormy crossing eventually arrive here, in a neat billet for the night. News of a retreat by Fritz on a 30-40 mile front is confirmed &amp; Cambrai &amp; St Quentin are objectives now. Many villages captured.</p>
<p>Tuesday 20<br/>At Abbeville en route for Amiens where we will begin to seek our units. The champagne incident. I have awakened from my dream. Many villages captured again yesterday.</p>
<p>Wednesday 21<br/>At Fricourt Farm again after coming from Amiens in motor cars. Ride from Abbeville to Amiens, 2nd class on a passenger. The unit moves back to Buire again tomorrow.<br/>News of the fall of Cambrai &amp; St Quentin &amp; other villages but ?</p>
<p>Thursday 22<br/>Move back with unit to Buire again. Snowing last night &amp; to-day but clear starlight nights. The above about Cambrai &amp; St Quentin is incorrect.</p>
<p>Friday 23<br/>At Buire which is still as bleak &amp; windy as ever it was. Much to my disgust I am not allowed to join "B" Section at Bazentin but am put in an officers ward. No work however.</p>
<p>Saturday 24<br/>At Buire. Beautiful day but windy. Summer time begins at midnight, meaning clocks to be put forward one hour. Spring is noticeably coming and sky larks are becoming common again &amp; the trees showing signs of bud.</p>
