7 - that I have not been able to sleep with the ache at nights - in my thighs as well now they are alright. I had diarrhoea for two days - but starved & got better I am grateful to say had not to stop work. I feel very well today - but hungry. The food is still very bad. But I find I am better not eating than eating rotten food.However by the time you get this I expect I shall be getting better food - all efforts are being made by the heads of all departments on the island to improve the food etc.
