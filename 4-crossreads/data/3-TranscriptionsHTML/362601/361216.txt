<p>8 June, Sunday</p>
<p>F.<br/>We pass the Canaries about 3 am &amp; I just see one island about 6 am. A nice howling quarter breeze &amp; nice steady roll helping the ship slong.</p>
<p>I work hard all day &amp; get a haircut which takes nearly an hour. I feel very I.O.W. sick on viewing Teneriffe all songs make me think. We have an extraordinary tea of fruit cake etc.</p>
<p>9 June, Monday</p>
<p>F.<br/>Very busy all day. Go to hi tea 2 class. A lot of teeth get scattered about. Fair swell all night &amp; this morning. I was very cool all night. I eat all sorts of rubbish all day long. Jack Craven comes up for a couple of hours. This marks the first milestone in a 2 year journey.</p>
