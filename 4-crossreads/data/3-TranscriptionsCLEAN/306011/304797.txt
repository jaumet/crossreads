  
 We went from Locre to Bailleul and in the centre of town turned off to the left & went on to Steenwerk. Two or three kilometres further on we arrived at the CCS. It is beside the railway line (for evacuation purposes) & has been there about 18 months. 
 Sunday 25th Nov 1917 (10 pm):- 
 To-day is the third anniversary of my sailing from Sydney on the old "Kyarra's"  [H.M.A.T. Kyarra] first trip. As in the case of birthdays & enlistment anniversaries, I spent the first in Egypt, second in France and now third in Belgium. We are behind the Messiness front where things are very quiet. Only a few wounded & gassed cases are coming through although the sick are giving us plenty of work. We are unfortunate in having a lot of British "tommies" around us who are on the whole a most ignorant and useless lot. There are always plenty of them parading sick. 
 I have been carrying on a correspondence with a friend living at Marseilles who has just spent several months in Corsica, and have learnt quite a lot about this French island possession.
