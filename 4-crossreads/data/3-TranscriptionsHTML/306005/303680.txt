The Tommies went out last night &amp; were followed by more this morning;  Rang up Bde this afternoon to see if Lieut Kater is back but found him still away: The Egyptian labor corps are now camped in the palm grove, at El Arish they appear rather comfortable with 1 tent to 6 men &amp; here we are camped within a mile of them &amp; not even a tent for the C.O. or Orderly Room.</p>
