<p>FEBRUARY 1917</p>
<p>24 SATURDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; fairly warm &amp; not so misty</p>
<p>as usual. I went up to the</p>
<p>new baths at Erquingham</p>
<p>for a bath in the morning &amp; cleaning</p>
<p>harness ect in afternoon. There</p>
<p>were several inspections by</p>
<p>Capt Campbell during the day</p>
<p>but everything was all right.</p>
<p>I got a mouth organ for Bill</p>
<p>Constable in morning &amp; the bit</p>
<p>of music livens things up</p>
<p>a bit in the hut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are &quot;down in the mouth&quot;</p>
<p>cheer up!!! Remmember Jonah</p>
<p>he came up all right.</p>
