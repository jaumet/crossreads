<p><u>Entry 18th - (Arrears)</u></p>
<p>Had a very busy 4 days at <s>Bourn</s> &nbsp;Lyndhurst &amp; a 3 hours&#39; examination after.</p>
<p>Left there on Friday 3rd Aug, spent the afternoon with another officer (6th Division) in Southampton. We had afteroon tea together at the Savoy - the Crab mayonaise was delicious. We trammed out to the Common - a beautiful road and a grand heavily timbered picturesque place for picnics. The Southampton Gardens &amp; open places are very fine. Leaving Southampton about 8.30pm we reached Salisbury about 9.30. I stayed at Neslon Temperance Hotel. Spent Saturday morning in Salisbury, bought several articles of furniture for the mess &amp; reached Codford Camp at <s>at</s> 1.30pm.</p>
<p>I was informed by Adjutant that I should most likely be going to France within a few days. So I applied for 2 days&#39; leave - from 10pm. Wed to 10pm Friday 9th Aug to 11th.</p>
