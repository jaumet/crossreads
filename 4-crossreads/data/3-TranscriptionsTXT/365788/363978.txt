 My dearest Irene, Was delighted to receive a letter from you dated 12th June. &amp; to note that you are gradually getting well. Thank you for posting on the letters I sent. &ndash; I was paraded before the Brigadier-General commanding Brigade &amp; recommended for a Commission, &amp; he has sent on the papers &ndash; which is tantamount to confirming it. As soon as it is confirmed will send you a cable. &ndash; Mary Stobo is always sending me parcels &amp; has been so good that I am glad you try to be charitable. Please God if I receive the commission I will make good old girl. &ndash; Am sure you must miss Will terribly &amp; will be glad when he is able to go home again. Margaret's was a dear little letter. How she is improving old girl. Am very sorry to hear that the Doctor &amp; Mrs Read have been ill &amp; I do trust Am very glad early closing of Hotels is passed. No more news old girl. Very much love to you all Always your loving brother, Fred.
