It seems that about a dozen Huns came at his post stumbling on it as they made towards the Tommies. Our chaps fired at them and they thereupon rushed our post under the leadership of one big fellow. Gawler killed him by revolver shot and the rest of the post accounted for the others, killing or wounding them all. The wounded lay on the ground in front of our posts but were all killed by our men. Their involuntary movements in their pain drew our men's fire on them. The bodies were all well "ratted" next evening but there were few marks of identity or souvenirs. Slept in clothes in a damp blanket with a waterproof overall ? very cold towards morning. A number of 5.9's fell very close here and caused our foundations to quake. A dark night in which the flares showed up brightly, roar of guns shells, and over and under ground crawl those poor worms called men.
