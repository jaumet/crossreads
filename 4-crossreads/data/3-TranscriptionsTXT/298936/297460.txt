Went into the trenches today & had a good yarn with the fellows
All seem to think of a change is a likely thing in the near future.
The [indecipherable] trenches are being strengthened  & prepared for such a contingency.
Parts of the units which that to Mudros for a rest have returned & the rumour of our immanent departure is once more on the rounds.  The position is that the 3rd Brig. who landed first are still at it.
