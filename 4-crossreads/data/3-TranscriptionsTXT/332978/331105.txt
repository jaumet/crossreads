 July 17th contd 26 British officers left this camp today for presumably Frieburg. I shifted from the Frenchmans barrack to the room with Gallagher &amp; Ingram. It is much better being here, I feel more at Home. It is quite a relief to release one's feelings at times. We three have formed a mess &amp; pool all of our food &amp; we are quite a happy family. 
 The food is prepared by us &ndash; taken to the cookhouse to be cooked by our orderly. We have Bkfast 9 am tea at 4 pm &amp; supper at 9 pm. We draw 2 plates of tin food from parcels room  daily at 10 am. 
 Leickler to the Infirmary today. He has a rash on him. 
 Invited to supper with Cull &amp; McQuiggan, it was quite a treat to have a feed of bully beef again. To bed at 11 pm 
 The English communiques are translated by Capt McKenzie daily &amp; published in a book. Joined a french class for beginners today, I am going to learn french. it is very difficult. 
 This camp is very spacious &amp; it is quite a daily occurence to see officers promenarding all around the camp for exercise. There is a Physical Jerks class at 7 am daily &ndash; very few attend needless to say.
