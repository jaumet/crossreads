<p>Wednesday 14 May 1919<br/>After the class rushed out to the hospital to Janet. Had tea &amp; then the Matron took Sister Ellerben, Janet, Marie &amp; me to the Bermondsey Town Hall to see her get presented avec a nice ivory set of  brushes. Very nice they were too. We had a couple of dances but it was too hot. Came back to the hospital early &amp; the Matron made coffee &amp; scrambled eggs for us all. Gee it was goodo too.</p>
