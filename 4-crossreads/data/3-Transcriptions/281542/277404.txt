<p>I doubt the resisting power of any earthwork or redoubt against these heavy shells.  They plough huge craters in the ground &amp; their size may be judged by the fact that <strike>one of</strike> the base of one wh was fired last night could have covered a large dinner plate with ease.  And they stand 3&frac12; feet high.</p>

<p>Gen. Godley, accompanied by Lieut-Col Heaton Rhodes returns from Mudros.</p>
<p>The weather continues warm, but rain is again threatening.</p>
<p>There has been a heavy naval bombardment today of an enemy encampment in direction of Kilid Bair.  The roar of the gun has rent the air all day &amp; the incessant concussion has been of nerve-racking effect.  The health of the troops is improving.</p>

<p>Wednesday 27th Oct 1915</p>
<p>A wild boisterous day with high wind from SE.  Rising temperature heralds approach of stormy weather.  The office has been deluged with dust which lies an inch thick on tables etc.</p>
<p>The Turks are determined to shift us.  At midday during the height of the gale they bombarded us for half an hour with big shell within a circle of 100 yds diameter.  The shells owing to the roar of the wind could not be heard till right upon us &amp; we could not place their direction.  The first was beautifully timed &ndash; it came with a deafening whizz, glanced off the back wall of the cook house &amp; went clean through one of the escort's dug-outs as if it were made of tissue paper.  It came to a dead-end half a dozen yds above the General's quarters.  A second shell planted itself near the wireless pole &amp; a third tore a crater in the earth at the mouth of the gully near the Indian Camp.  And then followed a fusillade of two or three shells a minute.  The strong &amp; cantankerous wind planted them in all sorts of odd <strike>places</strike> &amp; interesting places but fortunately no one was injured.  An Indian gunner received a slight chest bruise from a shell planted</p>
