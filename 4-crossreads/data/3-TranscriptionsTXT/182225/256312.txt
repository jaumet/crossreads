Fine in morning but raining in afternoon. On guard all day. Got off about 4.30 pm. We had an inspection of huts & were issued with ticks mattressesâ€‹ & pillowslips, also sleeping boards. They made some unholy regulations about keeping our clothes in certain places also. Sent a cable home. Came off guard & then stayed about the camp.
