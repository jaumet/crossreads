<p>Today Len had a party up in the trenches &amp; he got a bonzer piece of driving band up there, we are going to have it fixed up for Xmas, &amp; send it home.<br/>The Belgians are bombarding heavily tonight, &amp; the air is all quivering with the vibration from their gun's<br/>12th.  Up again at 4 a.m. it is surprising how warm the mornings are just at present why I never have my tunic on until it is time to fall the men in, I thought by this time it would have been freezing &amp; to all of us it has been a most agreeable shock.<br/>I am off again today the result of the "Telling off" I gave the Sergt. Major yesterday morning I reckon it does the world of good to shake them up now &amp; again.</p>
