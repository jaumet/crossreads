<p>The first night of our stay in Senlis we received word that there was going to be leave of one day a week to Ameins and then things began to move. Ameins was the big city that we had come through on our way down in the motors and was about 30 miles away on the main line to Boulogne and Paris, &amp; we were all very eager to get into the city and have a good look round and buy a few things that we were unable to procure at<br/>Senlis.</p>
<p>The first day after our arrival we started training, the infantry doing drill with rifle and bayonet and the Signallers with lamp and flag and Buzzers and each one of us on his own special Job. Myself and 2 others who were on the fulaphone, used to go out in the fields and put down a mile or so of wire and send messages to one another, or we were supposed to do so,</p>
