<p>3 October 1918 Thursday (X to X crossed out)<br/>Fever still bad- we have never been up to strength this year, altho' reinforcements come in dribs &amp; drabs-   I return paper cutting with this re July 14 fight, <strike>MINE</strike><br/>"It was the vigorous <u>infantry</u> assault" it should read "<u>dismounted</u>" there were <u>no</u> infantry there.<br/>If Turkey makes peace I hope I shall not be sent out of Egypt- X Dolly has just moved to Villa Montrose Pension Heliopolis- where Mardi stayed.  I never met her hubby but she should get one of the best. X   I cannot but feel glad that the fighting is over here &amp; I have seen it through from Gallipoli to the Canal &amp; to Damascus</p>
