1915Jan. 16 Sat.Went on leave ashore at 10.30 a.m. - Had watch mended - dinner at the Soldiers & Sailors' Home - Haircut at a French place  - Went out to Ibrehimieh & visited Rev. Fry, Scout Secretary for Alexandra, found him very decent, took me along to see his boys, nice lot of fellows. There are British, Italian, Greek, & Jewish Scouts in Alexandria. - Got lost coming back to wharf, did tremendous lot of walking & at last reached destination - taken aboard quickly on an Egyptian boat at 5 p.m.Heard that disembarkation of the Unit was to commence the following day. What rotten luck being dumped in Egypt instead of going on to Europe.
