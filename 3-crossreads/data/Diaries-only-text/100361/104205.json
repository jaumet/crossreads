Wed, Jan 30th
Good old Lill. Got 2 more Letters from her today and one from Mrs Pudmey. Mr P. has been in Bed for some weeks with a Broken Ankle. Lill's Letters ate the first I have received from her to say anything about my being wounded. Poor old Girl, she would be worried. 
Yesterday I went up for classification but was told that my card was not there and I wouldn't be wanted. Today I was up before "the Beak" for missing classification, but after my explanation the case was dismissed.
At night went up to the Kitchen and wrote some Letters. It is much warmer there than in our Hut.
Thur 31st
Another busy day. These formal dinners keep things humming. To see the Menu one would never imagine there was a Food Shortage in England.
Fri. FEB 1st
Big Air Raid over Paris; and a lot of damage done. I thought Paris was invulnerable to plane attacks, but was evidently mistaken. Wrote Letter No 5 to M.S. Got another Letter from her tonight dated Nov 21st. They are the only Letters I have received since being in this Camp, and they were jolly welcome.
Sat. 2
Bill Beards and I were on this afternoon, but we shall be "off" tomorrow. The weather is good.
