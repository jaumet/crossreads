 sick I heard about Wally being wounded.  I couldn't get any details, so have written to Rid to see if he can give me any.  Just before I came to hospital I got a budget of letters among which were yours of the following dates:- 10th, 11th, 17th, &amp; 24th of Sept for which I thank you very much  Thank you also for snap of Ol.  I believe Mrs Limn's address at present is Mrs P.J. Limn 172 Botany Road Botany Sydney.  When I get out of Hospital I am going to transfer back to Ambulance as Stretcher bearer.  Keep to present address though until further notice. Love to all at home, Your loving son, Leo.
