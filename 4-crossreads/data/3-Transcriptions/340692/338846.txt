<p>you can picture me trying to get on my wet boots in a little hole that it was impossible to stand up in, &amp; every minute of the delay the mud &amp; water rising, covering my only blanket &amp; groundsheet.  I felt at the very depths of discomfort &amp; despair.</p>
<p>I got through this night somehow, but there were others to follow that proved equally as hard, when I have laid stiff with the cold, aching with fatigue, &amp; preying for the daylight.</p>
