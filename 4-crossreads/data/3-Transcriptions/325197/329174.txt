<p>I thought we were in for a good old feed, but no luck. Tea, bread &amp; butter and cake, so we made the best of it. Got Princess Alice to sign my invitation card.</p>

<p>Sun. 10th Nov<br/>Taken to concert at the Palladium by Miss Golding</p>
<p>Mon. 11th November<br/>Going into London the guns started to fire at 11am just as I arrived into Ealing Broadway. Armistis has been signed and it was not long before the flags were flying from every window, and people crowding into the streets.</p>
<p>When I got into London the streets were packed with men, women &amp; children waving flags and singing. The excitement was high.</p>
