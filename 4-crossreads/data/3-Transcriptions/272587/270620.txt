<p>trenched &amp; there are many new large dugouts built for the accommodation of many men.  Everything points to winter quarters being taken up.<br/>Dec 6th  Move to North Flers.

The doc is likely to die of his wounds.  At Longueval.  Barr was wounded while driving &amp; had his horse killed.  The day has been fine &amp; Fritzs shooting very effective as a result.  He tore our trainline up at two places but it has since been repaired.<br/>Dec 12th  Very cold last night &amp; this morning the ground is covered with snow a heavy fall.<br/>Dec 13th  Still dull.  Last night the 5th Batt took German strong point without any opposition.  The same as from which the 1st was repulsed on Nov 5th.  A good number of wounded came in.
