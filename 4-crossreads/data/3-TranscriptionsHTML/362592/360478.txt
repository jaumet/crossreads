<p>G. Colquhoun,<br/>Solicitor.<br/>103 Elizabeth Street,<br/>Sydney.  188</p>
<p>Up'ards!<br/>A perky night was a comin down<br/>As a young chap past through a country town;<br/>In his fist he clutched a tattered flag,<br/>An' this 'ere motter was on the rag &ndash;<br/>"Up'ards!"</p>
<p>From under his old tile's battered rim<br/>His dark eyes flashed like a tallier glim;<br/>He lookt not to left, he lookt not to right,<br/>But continnerly hollered with all his might &ndash;<br/>"Up'ards!"</p>
<p>Three times thro' winders did he see<br/>Three sevril families takin' tea;<br/>He smelt the cakes, yet never swerved;<br/>But as he dropt a tear observed &ndash;<br/>"Up'ards!"</p>
<p>Says a cute old feller &ndash; "young cove take care,<br/>"There's a rotten old pine tree fixt up there,<br/>"Sure's eggs is eggs, it'll fall on yer head."<br/>The young man only winkt and sed &ndash;<br/>"Up'ards"</p>
