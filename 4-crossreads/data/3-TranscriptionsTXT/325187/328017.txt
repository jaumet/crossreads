[Sunday 1 October 1916]
Arrived Fleetwood 5 AM but as the Daylight Saving Bill puts all Time back one hour it is really 4 AM Irish time but to be different but from today all will be the same in the United Kingdom  I take train to Blackpool & change there for St Annes-on-Sea.Much talk of recent raids but a man's luck would be out if he got a BOMB in this country.Found Laura at the Grand & had a long yarn, & introduced her to the Isherwood family.  She gave Dolly some nice Fish Knives & has helped me a lot, poor old Laura I'll write again re her later
