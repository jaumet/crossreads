<p>Mess.  I finished my business at 6 p.m.  I booked my Room in the Strand at my usual place &amp; then had Tea at the Aldwych Theatre which has been taken over as a Y.M.C.A. establishment by the A.I.F. Y.M. Association.</p>
<p>I went to Drury Lane Theatre at night to see "Samson &amp; Delilah".  It was grand opera &amp; pretty heavy.  The stage is such a long way from the seats in the circle that I could hardly keep my eyes open in the second Part.  But the orchestra is wonderful.  It is supposed to be the best in the world.  Although there are over 20 performers</p>
