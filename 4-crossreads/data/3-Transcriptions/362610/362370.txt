<p>Saturday 3 June 1916<br/>A rather duller day with a steady NW wind. In the morning had to take the reinforcements who had recently joined up along to the gas school at Nouveau Monde, abt. 1 &frac12; mls. away. The school is held in a most beautiful residence where it is stated the Crown Prince was billeted when the Germans held this part. A large house beautifully appointed &amp; furnished &amp; surrounded by delightful gardens &amp; shrubberies kept in perfect order. The beeches, elms, poplars, acacias (in bloom) &amp; conifers looked their best, &amp; in the beds were good roses (Earl of Dufferin) in bloom, pansies, geraniums, lupins &amp;c. In the vegetable patch were peas, beans, carrots, tomatoes, lettuce, globe artichoke, onions &amp;c., with several rows of sturdy strawberries on which the fruit was just turning colour. Altogether a lovely home.<br/>Had to take the party down to the river bank where they were put thro' gas, &amp; on reaching home found that Capt. Cotton (2nd in command) had returned from London leave. The company was on fatigue in the afternoon &amp; after tea Lt. Cullenward left on leave to  London. Had a "Society" gathering &amp; tea together in Sailly, getting home abt. 9 o'c.</p>
