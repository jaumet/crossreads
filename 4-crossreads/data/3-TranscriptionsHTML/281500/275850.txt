<p>though tonight I am feeling very much better, but last night I felt absolutely rotten, &amp; so I went to bed early, but could get very little rest, for the boys were celebrating Xmas Eve in our hut, &amp; were keeping their spirits up with cocoa &amp; rum more rum than cocoa I should judge by the row they were kicking up, these were the names of a few of them Freddic Turner, our C.S.M. Jack Hayes (Q.M.) Sgts. Price, Mackie &amp; Bellchambers, Wilson &amp; Cpls. Tin &amp; Bill Bradley, all decent chaps, &amp; songs &amp; chorouses were going round all the evening but about 1O O'clock the performance showed signs of degenerating for the rum was beginning to tell &amp; things were getting boisterous</p>
