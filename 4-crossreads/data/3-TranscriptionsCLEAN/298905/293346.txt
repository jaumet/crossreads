for writing in that silly strain but the very fact of it being so appeals to meGot a letter from Len to-day I have been waiting anxiously for news of him, he is in 18th General Hospital at Cameaies, & pretty crook however he is much better off there than here for we are in for a stouching up for a certainty, for we are going to try & do what English troops have so far failed to do & that is take a wood near Highwood, they have taken it twice, but each time were driven out I believe the artillery fire is something hellish, & I don't expect many of us will come out alive & our Brigade are the first to go over & I think our Batt are leading the charge, it is bound to be a most terrific fight
