<p>Tuesday 10/12/18</p>
<p>Over with only a light rain, quite different to Australia, where one can nearly always reckon on a downpour, just alongside of my Cabin is a main road where a lot of traffic passes daily. I believe it is the main road from Bolougne to Abbeville and day and night numbers of motor wagons, cars and motor cycles go racing by and makes one almost think the War was still on, only we do not get any night alarms of enemy aircraft and can hear no report of guns. I will now stop writing until later on.</p>
<p>Friday 13th. Word came through on the telephone before lunch that I was to return to the camp to take up my duties again. Driving on Saturday so after lunch on Saturday I put my belongings on a truck and duly left for the depot at Pende. On arrival I reported to the Orderly Sergeant and was put with No 6 Hut and very soon was fixed up</p>
