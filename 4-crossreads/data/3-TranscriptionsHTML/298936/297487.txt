<p>December, 1915</p>
<p>Friday 3</p>
<p>No. 1 Stationary Hospital shelled. One high explosive dropped clear into a ward tent &amp; hit six of the staff four died &amp; 2 were wounded one of whom will lose his leg.</p>
<p>It seems inhuman for helpless men to be shelled whose fault it is I cannot say, for there are guns of ours very near &ndash; it is at these that the Turks fire I think, but something should be done.</p>
<p>The trouble is that we are so cramped for room.</p>
