<p>April 1918<br/>On Sunday afternoon Hornsey &amp; I went out to the Briggs  We stayed for afternoon tea &amp; supper.  They had their French friends there &amp; we all had a good time.  I cant remember the name of the people but was asked to go to dinner next Sunday.  Will be on duty next Sunday so arranged to go the following Sunday.  They are going to have a motor picnic to the Barrage on the Monday following &amp; was asked to go but don't know whether I will be able to go yet.  Went to see the Belle of New York played by the Scamps at the Kursaal on the Monday night</p>
