our Band gave a programme. The first band to reach this far forward. Put in the afternoon on odds and ends eventually met the General who told me that the 5 7th Bdes attack tonight and that the 24 23rd move forward. I move up tomorrow night relieve in the newly captured positions. Rested the men and then got them to bomb proof their places ? a wise move as we were raided later by planes. Saw two very dead Huns today near a couple of bivouacs. The flies off their wounds were getting on the bread jam of some Billjims who were unconcernedly munching near by. Sutherland is with us tonight here and Harry Thewlis returned from his school today. Harricks is dopey.
