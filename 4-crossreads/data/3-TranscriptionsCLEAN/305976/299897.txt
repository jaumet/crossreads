  
 I saw at one Mosque a pit connected to river Nile. Its sides were at one time covered with knives so that when persons were thrown in the pit their bodies would be  thrown in the Nile  be cut into small pieces on reaching bottom Friday August 3 Camel riding to day with better success than last time. Visited Luna Park in evening. Luna Park situated at Heliopolis the cleanest & most beautiful place I have seen in this country. Wide, well made streets & big substantial stone building. Was I am told built for a second Monte Carlo but authorities would not permit it. Luna Park is a pleasure
