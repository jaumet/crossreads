<p>France 12/11/18<br/>Dear Old Bean<br/>Well how do you like Australia now that you are back there &ndash; I suppose though with your usual pig headedness you are trying to get back here again. Well if you remember, you once gave me the tip not to be a fool but to stay in blighty, so I'll return the compliment, &amp; tell you to stick tight to old N.S.W. This show is not going to last much longer without the bottom falling out of it and its no use your butting in again after  the share you have already had. Things were pretty lively over here last September October &amp; November but now it has developed into a gentlemans war and is very quiet indeed. Your old crown have had a trip to Cambrai but are now back here again without having declared war. But where we are at present is a regular home &ndash; you know the idea just a regular programme for the artillery every day, breakfast</p>
