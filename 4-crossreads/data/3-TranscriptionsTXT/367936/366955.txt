 Wednesday 29 March 1916 Dick, Jim Oakley &amp; I cut 25 bags of chaff.  Father riding round. In afternoon Father, Mother &amp; Miss Sterling drove to Warrobil &amp; I rode Zaida. I left for Sydney by evening train.  We do want rain badly.  Don't like leaving home while this drought is still on. 
 Thursday 30 March 1916 Arrived in Sydney 6-30 and went over to Mosman.  I went up and saw Dr. Mason.  He says I am just right but I should have had a few more days.  Went into town with Aunt Katie, got pair of boots and had my photo taken.  In evening Telarah people came over &amp; we had a sing song.
