<p>My dearest Mother   &amp;  Sisters,</p>
<p>Perhaps my next letter will be from London. We are expecting to get our leave next Friday.</p>
<p>Belle, this letter should reach you about the time of your birthday. I hope you will have a very happy day   &amp;  lots of presents. Trust I shall be home for your next.</p>
<p>We are having beautiful weather   &amp;  if it continues so, it will be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  very good</p>
