 [Following paragraph is crossed out] Sent a Requisition to Ordnance for 520 Helmets assorted sizes got answer back today are these GAS!!!! Fancy any man in Ordnance thinking Gas Helmets were wanted in Egypt; these are the sort of delays &amp; replies of Red tape unthinking officials. Received letters from  Grace Galbraith 14/2/16  Walter Campbell 20/2/16 &amp; Joh Those I wrote to the base for yours will be coming along.  Very hot  All my photos of Native [indecipherable] destroyed by Native photographed,I felt inclined to pitch him into the Nile, only reply I could get was "it is the will of ALLAH"
