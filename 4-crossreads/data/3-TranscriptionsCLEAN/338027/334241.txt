  
 Turn over for Wednesday 
 Friday, 17 September, 1915 Few showers during the day but not heavy, went up into the new trench to-day and had a few shots.  Things are very quiet on our front now, there is only an odd demonstration now.  The Turks can still snipe one part of the beach and yesterday they got the dispatch rider's horse.  There is a fine tramway down at Anzac now, and what with the motor lorry service it saves a remarkable amount of work.  Anzac has improved wonderfully it is like a small city now only a few months ago it was an impregnable hill till our lads took it with the bayonet. 
 Saturday, 18 September, 1915 Went round to L.H.F. for mail & drugs & found that two more of the old corp were dead Annand & Thomas, the former was the first man we had shot he died at sea next day, Thomas died of Enteric fever contracted on the hospital boats.  Late in the afternoon there was a sharp attack somewhere either the Turks or us.  Rifle & machine gun fire was heavy for about an hour we have not heard particulars yet.  Our Reg got the order to stand to arms in readiness but it quietened down a lot then.  No mail from Vic only N.S.W received at the corp.
