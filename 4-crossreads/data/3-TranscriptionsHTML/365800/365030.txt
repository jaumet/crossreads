<p>Of wet weather. The climate here is lovely just like that of Australia, the sunsets are glorious. The days here are very long we have daylight at &frac14; to 4 in the morning and it does not get dark till 8.303 pm so you see we have a very short night.</p>
<p>Kindest regards to all at home. I hope that all are well and happy.</p>
<p>From Your Loving<br/>Son   &amp;  Brother</p>
