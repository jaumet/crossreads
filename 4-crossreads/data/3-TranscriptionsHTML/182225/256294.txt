<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; SATURDAY 24&nbsp;&nbsp; JUNE</p>
<p>A beautiful warm calm day &amp; the sea as smooth as a mill pond. We had a buzzer lecture in the morning and we had a concert in the afternoon. The concert was very good. It was great to look at the great Crowd of men huddled up together all as happy as &quot;sandboys&quot; and the sun shining on the sea in the background &amp; never knowing what minute we may be sunk by a torpedo. I often wonder when I see the men gathered together like that how many will come back whole.</p>
