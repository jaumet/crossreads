<p>October 1916<br/>away, but only four of them exploded, &amp; he sent over a few more early this morning, looking for our heavy batteries.  I found Pritchard this morning.  (He is in No 1 Section &amp; Sam in No 4.)  This morning after breakfast he &amp; I went out together to Delville Wood, which is about 2 miles behind the front line.  We passed through the once village of Longueval, which is now nothing but a heap of broken bricks &amp; not even the trace of a wall left standing.<br/>Some of our batteries are stationed near it.  We found some fine curios in the "Wood."</p>
