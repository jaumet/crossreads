<p>were lined with iron. It was 10.p.m. &amp; just getting dark by the time we worked our way back to our dugout over a series of shellholes entanglements &amp; trenches.</p>
<p>Friday July 20,1917. (1082.)<br/>All the sleeping rooms in this vast dug out are overcrowded and dozens sleep on the hard damp floor, and many use the various passages. There are 5 exits, and it is very warm inside, especially near the gas engine used for driving the dynamo. It was 12 Oclock when I got to bed &amp; I did not get up until near 9. This morning the hold was full of water &amp; it took over an hour for two of us to pump it out. I went up on top for about &frac12; an hour for some fresh air. Fritz was shelling some of our guns behind &amp; many shells fell close to this cavern. When I was getting a drink at the cook house at no 9 exit a shell landed within 10 yards of me. There were the two walls of the trench between me &amp; it, &amp; I was stooped trying to get some water out of a petrol tin when it went off, so it all went over me. There were others about &amp; none were hurt.<br/>[Next portion is in shorthand, with "86. I also", included]<br/>Later I heard that the shell was a dud. I was so close to it I could not tell &amp; did not stop to examine. It broke in the trench which was repaired in the evening. While doing so a corpse was discovered under the trench.</p>
<p>Saturday July 21, 1917. (1083.)<br/>I slept in one of the tunnels last night in company with a lot of British Artillery men who were shelled out of their billets &amp; came to the tunnel for safety. There is more room here, &amp; better air, &amp; it is not so</p>
