<p>may be away for four days or longer and we have our billets there.<br/>16.6.16 Arrived last night on the wagons about 9 o'clock and passed the night in a machine gun emplacement in one of our trenches. No set hours here for reveille etc breakfast about 7. Then work from 8 to 12. Then light lunch of cheese &amp; jam and work from <strike>2</strike> 1 &ndash; 5 rest of time off. We helped in sandbagging the trenches for a while then were put on twisting wires for revetment stays for pickets. Dinner at 5 of roast beef or steak and baked potatoes and vegetables. In the afternoon after dinner the Germans started firing near where we were working. We are working in an old house which about 3 days previously was shelled by the Germans and made some casualties however nothing has happened up to 24.6.16. The gun the Germans were after is a six inch howitzer about 200 yards from us and one heard the shells lazily zoom-zooming just above our heads followed almost immediately by a big bang. However up to 24.6.16 they have failed to get it. That night we were awakened by a gas alarm but fortunately it passed by us and we didn't require our helmets. All men ordered into trenches while strafe was on.<br/>17.6.16 Gas alarm by rattling an empty shell case or beating an iron triangle when news comes from the trenches. Same work and a few more shells round trying to get our guns which are beautifully concealed and this place is alive with every description of them. In the evening we secured some boards and laid a floor to our dugout which is shrapnel proof but not for high explosive shells. Flares at night look very pretty all round us and Fritz has immensely superior light rockets or shells to ours. A raid was made on the german trenches and some flares captured which was just what we wanted  &amp; the raiding Anzacs have got short leave to England and &pound; 40 divided among them (about4)<br/>18.6.16 Same work. Just the same on Sunday as any other day here. paid at 5 o'clock. Tonkin old S.P.S.C. boy clerk for our section. Met him while looking over Islington before the war. Big strafe in afternoon and Fritz set fire to two billets by high explosive &amp; then poured in shrapnel.</p>
