<p>19/2/18<br/>Dear Sis  &amp; Vol<br/>Have just received your letter  &amp; snap of Noni dated 4/11/17. Am sorry I have not time to write you a letter but I have had 46 in 8 days  &amp; I can only answer them by sending cards as I am going up the line tomorrow. Am glad you are all well again. Noni has indeed changed unless that photo is not a good one. Thanks ever so much for it.  Am glad you like my photo. Do not worry about me going up the line as I may get another little "blighty" Hoping you are all well  &amp; happy &amp; having the best of luck. I am your loving old brother Hal.</p>
