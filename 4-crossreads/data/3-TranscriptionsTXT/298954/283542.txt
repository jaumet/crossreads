1917Thu. 8th Nov."Wolf" is on the trade-routes, heading S.W.
The raider is now crammed with prisoners, the women with their husbands and the military officers living amidships;  the male passengers (European) in a small partitioned-off space in no 3 hold.
The latter "saloon" boasts a piano, 11 ordinary cabin bunks and two wicker chairs and is thus quite elaborate (for the "Wolf".)    Also, they have been promised "food from the German Officer's Mess", which means that they are handed the omnipresent tinned crab on a plate instead of in it's "native" tin.
Possibly to prevent conspiracy the different groups of prisoners are separated more or less strictly.
The poop is sacred to the merchant-service, (port side for men, starboard for officers,);  the starboard after-well deck is for passengers, the port side for Japanese.
The ladies are permitted to visit the after well-deck to gossip at certain times.
