<p>1918 May 28<br/>said he was the coolest customer they had ever seen. My morning shift on the phone was from 5 till 8 am. Gunner Bruce used to wake me, hand over the phone and then toddle out to make some tea and toast. I did not get up but lay in bed with the receiver against my ear. One morning when I was only half awake, Jim re-awoke me. Flames were all over my blankets and a pile of papers and on the curtain hanging on the front of the possie. I patted out the blanket flames while Jim stamped on my gas mask which had caught alight while hanging up. The candle was near my feet on a tin hat and I must have knocked it against the curtain. Jim saw smoke issuing from the possie and ran back from our kitchen to see what was wrong. My gas mask was partly burnt and useless, so I had to phone HQ for another. I spent a very uncomfortable day waiting as I was afraid that it might strike Fritz to send gas over, in which case I would have had to resort to the emergency method of protecting myself, which is not pleasant, as every soldier knows.</p>
