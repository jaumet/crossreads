<p>The original is going forward by this mail to Mrs Knowles with the hope that she may be pleased <strike>with it</strike> by it.</p>
<p>1-12-15. Just think the first day of the last month of 1915, and here am I still in Egypt. How much longer? List how Ruskin greeted me:/<br/>"The path of a good woman is indeed strewn with flowers, but they rise behind her steps, not before them." &ndash; Sesame &amp; Lilies. &ndash;</p>
<p>I gave my Shakespearian calendar to Colonel Howse when at Anzac. He is in Egypt just now. Prof Watson told me that Pierot Fiaschi is also in Egypt. I have not seen him.</p>
<p>But 62 years &ndash; note at foot of calendar page &ndash; since the railway line from Charing Cross to Greenwich was opened. What marvels have been achieved in steam traction and petrol motors since then. The march of the latter around the world has been much more rapid than even the former.</p>
<p>Notice at post office:&ndash; "Mail for Australia closes here today at 5 p.m." Therefore shall I close this letter here and now.</p>
<p>Good bye my dears. To my friends, Maria and the others, please offer my greetings. For you may the New Year open with happiness &amp; joy while each day of it, right to the end, shall flow over with good health, high fortune, and all other the blessings of God. Love in abundance with heaps of kisses for each of you from<br/>Your affectionate Father<br/>John B. Nash</p>
