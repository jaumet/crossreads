Cold & frosty this morning.Last night things were very merry at bed time through some of the boys getting too much Rum and coffee.I was working on the Burnisher this morning for a while, until I was called off to go with others to be examined by a board at 11. a.m.  When we got there, there was so many to be examined that we were told to report again at 2. p.m. On the second parade I was asked a few questions and marked fit. Only one was sent to a board from the Transports for further examination and 8 from the Battalion.
There was an issue of tobacco & cigarettes today.
