 battery on our left.&nbsp; About 4.15 he started to put shells right into the camp.&nbsp; We were all ordered out of the camp on to the open fields at the back of us.&nbsp; We lost no time in making away from the danger spots.&nbsp; We were at last receiving our baptismal fire.&nbsp; I must say that the experience is anything but nice.&nbsp; But I am not very much afraid.&nbsp; I thought I should be much more nervous of it than I am.&nbsp; A shell landed into a tent of newly arrived Pioneers who were having tea therein.&nbsp; It killed 9 men outright and wounded 8 others.&nbsp; This happened about 25 yards from our dug-outs.&nbsp; Things have grown so hot from a shelling point of view, that our O. C. Major Greenaway, has given orders that we move further up to a more sheltered position ahead of the batteries.&nbsp; We are moved up to an old ruined factory or domicile, it is hard to distinguish which, which gives a better air of protection than did the rat-holes in the ground which were covered with a sheet of iron, which might just as well have been a newspaper, and which we inhabited until just now.&nbsp; The evening was spent quite peacefully, to the accom-paniment of the booming of hundreds of guns which were fired incessantly for two or three hours.&nbsp; I was rocked to sleep by the rythm of their maddening roar, and when they ceased firing about 10 I awakened to wonder at the silence, the awful horror of the silence that seemed to reign in our eerie-like abode.&nbsp; Slept all night on a concrete floor and came through it very well, all things considered.

 Spent day in our new quarters awaiting orders amd shaping things to more comfortable conditions, if that is possible.&nbsp; With the incessant detonation of the guns, the old place seems to rock and one is almost afraid that the ruin will fall down around us.&nbsp; Was detailed to help with construction of the kitchen as we are/evidently going to remain here for some little time.&nbsp; Sections 1 and 3 ordered to the support line to carry on the work of construction of dugouts.&nbsp; Fritz got busy and put some shells into the A. M. C. Tents and hospital.&nbsp; Heard that his stumt had accounted for 23 casualties.&nbsp; Spent evening writing letters.&nbsp; Turned in early.&nbsp; Artillery opened out with heavy barrage soon after and got up to watch the awe-some spectacle of all these myriad guns despatching their grim messengers of death over to the Hun lines.&nbsp; The noise is indescribable but manage to get to sleep in spite of it.
