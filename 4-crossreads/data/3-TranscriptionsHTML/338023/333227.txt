<p>I can tell you it does not go far here, &amp; it is essential to save some for possible leave en route.<br/>'Five hundred' is getting the fashionable game aboard now. Last night a chap in my section &ndash; Bob Bydder - &amp; I played two others. One game ran out to about 20 hands &amp; ended with us out &amp; the opponents about 1600 behind (-minus)  The following game ended at 'lights out' with both sides minus &ndash; they 600, we 790. We are satisfied that it cuts out time better than chess &ndash; when the play goes like that!</p>
<p>Now I'm going to shoot this along to the censor-censorious &ndash; hys &ndash; sanctum-sanctorium .</p>
<p>With much love from Harry.</p>
