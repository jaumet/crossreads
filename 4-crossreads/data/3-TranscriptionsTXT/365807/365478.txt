have it, as it was probably one of the last written by the dear boy; it is dated two days before he was killed -
It was long in reaching us, & it happens to be the only one signed with his full name -
We only got one or two letter cards before, signed "Arthur".
We are wondering how he died, probably went into action just after, or a shell may have found their trench!
I hope the thought of his bravery & his duty done, will help you both to bear up bravely also, in this time of trouble & sorrow.
Your loving sisterF. Ferguson
