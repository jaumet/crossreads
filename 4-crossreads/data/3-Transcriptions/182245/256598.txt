<p>MARCH 1917</p>
<p>24 SATURDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; Sunny but with a very</p>
<p>nippy wind. Rode down to</p>
<p>Steenwerck in morning with Rohu</p>
<p>for rations, from there on to</p>
<p>Erquingham &amp; Armenti&egrave;res</p>
<p>&amp; had dinner there. Went on</p>
<p>to the battery position after. Old</p>
<p>Fritz lobbed a 5.9&quot; shell about</p>
<p>15 yds off me as I was going past</p>
<p>&quot;Le [?on]&quot; dump. He shelled out a</p>
<p>battery of NZ guns about quarter</p>
<p>of a mile from our position today.</p>
<p>I went &amp; had a look at their pits</p>
<p>&amp; there&#39;s no doubt their shooting</p>
<p>is marvellous. Had tea</p>
<p>with Joe Clonan at his billet</p>
<p>&amp; then came on home.</p>
