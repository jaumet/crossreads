Bit of dissatisfaction caused to-day as after our hard work in the stables they wanted us to go on working at rifle exercises signalling etc. This seemed unfair as when we volunteered for the work we were told we would be free as soon as our work was over and after a good deal of fuss we managed to scrape through without doing any work.15.4.16Nothing important happened. Rice and prunes for dinner and bonza steaks for breakfast.Saturday 16.4.16 Washing in the afternoon and when over wrote some more letters. Five done up to date.Sunday Sighted land this morning very blurred but soon developed. Passed  Cape Island of Socotra last night and now that is Cape Gardafui. Came directly opposite at about 11 o'clock and was about 10 miles away then but now we are within about two miles of the coast. There are several Arab dhows sailing about and have gone into the land which is apparently absolutely barren and desolate but must have their homes there. Apparently their business is fishing. The sea is quite calm and almost of a dull green. There is a long sandy is spit running out to a point which is very rugged although apparently crumbling and back from this is the Cape rising very ruggedly to a great height and having a sort of cave in the side which some of the men say is inhabited however I can see no sign with the glasses which are very useful and in great demand. It is getting very warm although there is a perfect cool breeze and I have my hammock slung on the best side of the boat to the rafters of the awnings while writing this up and soon I shall write some more letters. We shall soon be in the Gulf of Aden and expect it pretty warm. My get to our destination next Sunday.17.4.16 Saw quite a number of sailing boats about and this evening a steamer coming up astern which we think is the "Pera" a faster troopship to ours and which was berthed next to us at Wooloomooloo and left a couple of days later. However up to breakfast time next morning she hadn't appeared.18.4.16 Woke up just as it was getting light this morning to see on our port side a warship lying alongside an island and then on our starboard side appeared Perim or in British Somaliland which is a naval station and has a wireless apparatus with about 15 houses. The land was very rugged and grand with little islands and headlands and rises abruptly
