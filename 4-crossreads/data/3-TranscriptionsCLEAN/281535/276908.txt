The heavy green buds of the trees only want this to make them burst.  In the evening had dinner with the Mathys and Jamsins. An exquisite dinner. The Belgians are rather angry with England for supporting Geneva as the seat of the League of Nations. Madame Mathys was a little disappointed at not being asked by us to come to "La Traviata". The wine very good 6 bottles to 5 persons the doctor says is his measure of Burgoyne. Very tasty. A finale of coffee and Benedictine sent everyone home just pleasantly elated. They speak of parties of 3 who can polish off 15 bottles.
