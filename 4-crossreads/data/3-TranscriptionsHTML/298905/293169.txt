<p>it is a lovely trip, &amp; I thoroughly enjoyed it , we ran into Victoria Station about 7 oclock, talk about a crowd of people they formed us up again &amp; marched us out through the people how they clapped &amp; cheered us, theres no doubt about the popularity of the Colonials.<br/>My first impression  of London was nothing out of the ordinary, the streets don't seem to be as busy as George, King or Pitt streets in Sydney, &amp; the buildings are all of a dark grey colour at the same time any fool can see that she is a mighty city.<br/>They took us down to the Australian Hqr's first, &amp; there I handed my rifle in, I then struck out for Peel House, &amp; on my way down saw Bert Miller, &amp; Alex Howarth arrived at Peel House I took a room had a good wash posted 40 letters</p>
