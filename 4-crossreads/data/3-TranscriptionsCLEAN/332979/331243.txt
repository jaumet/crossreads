on our Journey. The Weather all day was very Muggy. A Thunderstorm was working up which broke during the Evening. The Lightning was beautiful like Skyrockets breaking in the Sky. I never have seen any thing like it in W.A. It was raining all night but the Sea was smooth. Lights out again at 8.30 Pm so all soon was quiet.
18/2/17. SundayAll hands astir at the usual time. The Weather has cleared up & it was very pleasant all day. Land could be seen during the day & at night a Lighthouse could be seen, I believe it was A the East London. Church parade was held on the Well & Poop Decks at 10 am & was well attended. Had a very nice Dinner of Roast Mutton, Potatoes
