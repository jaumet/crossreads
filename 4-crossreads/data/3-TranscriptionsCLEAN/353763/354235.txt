  
 The general health is excellent however & I'm purely a watch dog  - We put in time as best we can  -  The average sailor man knows his job but knows nothing else  -  The conversation generally turns on Pubs & women & I very much doubt if the conversation  aft    -  be a single degree better than that  forward   - This is very regrettable I think  -  If I were an N  - O  -  - and executive NO - I'd put my foot down very firmly on  my  ship on all loose lewd talk  -  Its really awful at times the filth & obscene talk of men who really are good chaps & mind you - some of the chief officers are  very  the  bad  worst  -  Why high spirits & effective work should be linked to this dreadful drivel I don't know but it pervades both army & navy  -  Of course there are men - like myself - silent the whole time  -  One can do but little to check this sort of thing I regret to say  -
