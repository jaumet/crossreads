 Friday 13 April 1917 
 Our horses are a bit shin sore coming off the Sandy Desert into this good country &ndash; they are all very good walkers now - &amp; got good grazing on the crops of Bearded Wheat &amp; Barley &ndash; but Water is still scarce.  JOE 4/3/17. Letters from Mother &amp; Daisy &amp; May 27/2/17. Papers from Dolly &amp; a Cake from Laura. All very acceptable.  - on our arrival back into Camp after 24 hours on Outpost. 
 Every day we can watch our anti aircraft shells bursting among enemy planes &ndash; not much success tho'.  Day's letter had large cutting of D'quin Paper .
