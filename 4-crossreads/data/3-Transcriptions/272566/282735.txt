<p>Friday 21 December</p>
<p>Snow still lies on the ground and frost also formed through the night.  The ground is frozen &amp; so are the water holes.<br/>Making a fire all the morning.<br/>After dinner I was sent to a village 26 Kilos the other side of Desvres &ndash; a total distance of over 32 Kilos each way.  Took 25 minutes to go there and 20 minutes to return.<br/>Run to Samer after tea to A.D.M.S. Signallers and the 5th Div. Workshops.<br/>It has been very cold today and my ears feel it most.</p>
