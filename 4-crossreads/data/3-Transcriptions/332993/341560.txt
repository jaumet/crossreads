<p>Wednesday August 1, 1917. (1094)<br/>At 2.25 a.m. a shell cut the wires leading to the dug out at the foot of the hill &amp; cut off the light. The engine saved &amp; the lights here increased in brillancey or we would not have known.<br/>As the lights were not required here after midnight we stopped the engine &amp; went to bed.<br/>There was heavy rain all night and it is showery all day. The sap was overflowed and the pump half emerged.<br/>It took Ferguson &amp; me three solid hours to pump it out. It has been making water fast all day &amp; this evening, &amp; we have been in the pump pretty often.<br/>I have not seen a paper this week and we have heard very little news from the office except that we are holding our gains &amp; made some further gains last night on this sector. The French are doing well.<br/>There was great artillery activity last night &amp; throughout today. I heard some of our 15 in guns at work. They shake the earth. Fritz sent over this dugout a large number of high velocity shells in slearch of batteries.</p>
<p>Thursday August 2, 1917. (1095.)<br/>The ground is very wet and sloppy, &amp; the roads are covered with soft slippery mud, &amp;amp off the roads one sinks over the boot tops. There were frequent light showers. This sector is very quick today. There is not much artillery activity, especially from the enemy.<br/>There is a plague of vermin in this dug out. We are all more or less covered with lice and all continually scratching. I have frequently taken off my shirt and slautered the enemy. Fortunately there are not many rats in the dug out for there is no cover about, but at the horse lines they are very numerous &amp; as large as small rabbits.</p>
