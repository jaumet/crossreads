entered the Harbour, which is very small being a piece of Table Bay, built by breakwater leaving only a very small entrance of about 100 yards. It is very hot in the sun. Early dinner was allowed leave from 1PM till 10.30PM. The town is about a mile from the Docks, is a fair size & very nice. The Avenue (of Oaks) is very nice, also the Gardens, pier, Paliament House etc. We (four) went to Campo Bay, 11 miles round trip round the "Lions Head" it is a lovely trip winding up the Mountain by electric tram, travelling on the edge of the Cliffs obtaining a good view of the coast & a fine look out at Sea. The "Table Cloth" on the Table Mountain is very pretty  we obtained a good view of it. There is not much traffic in the Town, about 6 different trams.
The people are very patriotic free buffets, tea & cake or bread and butter, everything is done for our comfort. We went to a orchestra concert on the pier tonight it was fair (free to us) We had a feed of fruit & returned to ship at 10.15PM being
