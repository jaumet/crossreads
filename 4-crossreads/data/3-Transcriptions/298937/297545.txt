<p>Tuesday 21st March</p>
<p>General <strike>G</strike> Djafer left for Sultan's palace to-day.<br/>He gave me his address &amp; I gave him mine;  we are to correspond.  My last conversation when I took him in a sleeping draught the night before last was rather long.  He has great faith in Turkey's power to carry on, &amp; in Bulgaria's.  The discipline of the Germans is, he says, immense.<br/>Men &amp; officers are perpetually in the trenches for months at a time.</p>
