  
  October  1916 cattle  train  trucks & left at about 8.40 AM- destination unknown.  We passed through numerous villages, & at about 1 PM first heard the firing of the guns. At 4.30 we arrived at Albert and detrained. Albert, which was once a large & picturesque city is now a mass of ruins.  The noted cathederal with the "Vergin & the Child" now overhanging the street is like the rest of the city, in ruins. Only 8 of us came on to Albert, the others went to the 4th Divn, which is at Armentiers    We walked through the town & out to Fricourt Wood about 5 Km. out.
