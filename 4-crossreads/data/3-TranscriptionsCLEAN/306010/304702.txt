  
 Thurs. 21" Dec. 16 10 a.m. We had a very foggy morning about 5 days ago so that when there was a loud explosion about 10 a.m. nobody could see anything. At any rate we found a big piece of embankment blown away between the railway & our camp. Whether it was a bomb, shell etc. no one knows. Got a "shove up" a couple of days ago to  Staff Sergeant  dating back to 28"Nov. Had been a Sergt about 14 mos. Am now Chief Clerk with a staff of 2 Sergts, 3 Cpls & 8 Ptes. Will be taking charge of a portion of the Hospitals wards as Section Wardmaster in a few days. The day before yesterday we had a fair fall of snow. I was out in it and very soon was covered with soft a white mantle. In the evening the snow thawed and the roads became as slippery as glass. (109)
