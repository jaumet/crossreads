Dearest Mother,
We are getting very near the end of our journey. Crossed the Line a few days ago, and should be off Aden next Tuesday. Then we have 4 days run up the Red Sea, and shall probably disembark, and take the train to Suez. on Saturday, a week from now.
It has been a glorious trip ever since leaving Albany. The sea has been perfectly calm, and the boat just seems to glide along. She is a lovely steamer, and the largest I have ever been on, for a trip. In Hazel's letter I told all about my luck in getting a de cabin to doss in, and as far as I am concerned, I may be a Saloon passenger, except for the tucker, and that hardly comes up to Saloon standard, though personally I have no complaints to make. We get plenty of fresh meat & vegetables & soup besides prunes & figs, rice & plum pudding. Of course there are always some growlers everywhere, and we have some here, but I think they are a long way in the minority.
