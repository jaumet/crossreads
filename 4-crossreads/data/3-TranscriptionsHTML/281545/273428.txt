<p>ahead going slowly having a heavy load on, one of the Signal Men placed 2 detonators on the line as a warning to us, &amp; they exploded when being passed over &amp; we followed &amp; soon arrived at a station, &amp; having to stop there 10 minutes it gave the Goods Train a chance to get clear of us, any how we never saw it again.   This way of working trains is necessary so as to not hold up important Trains during busy times.   I noticed the benefit of handling a lot of Trains near Hazebruick, as when we left we passed 2 goods Trains waiting to come in, 2 light Engines &amp; 2 more Trains behind them all on the same line &amp; in one Section, all waiting to get into Hazebruick yard.   We arrived back on time &amp; soon again was in at the Depot, when I had my dinner &amp; being weary after my walk in Bethune &amp; standing up on the Engine both ways, I laid down &amp; had a short nap awakening up at 6 Pm where I went in again to the Mess &amp; had a cup of tea &amp; a Salmon sanwich, which I enjoyed, &amp; then came back to the Hut &amp; spent the evening writing up this Diary.</p>
<p>Monday 11/3/18.   This day was the last for my run to Bethune so having a good knowledge of the road also my chums so we all rode in a Coach there and back, we arrived there on time &amp; had three of the 60th Coy of Aus Engine Men who are stationed at Bergues near <strike>Camp</strike> Dunkirk in our Compartment</p>
