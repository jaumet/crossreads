My dear Mother,
Just a line to say that I received two parcels yesterday, both through the post.  They are pretty late ones too as one was dated 30th March .  I'm not at all sorry that they have discontinued sending parcels through the Comforts Fund,.  I never did have much faith in it, and it was no use spending all your time and energy, if the parcels were not going to reach their destination.  The parcels contained:- No. 1.  A pair of socks, some thin under-belows, writing pad etc., and was very acceptable, so my earthly possessions are now at a low ebb.  You certainly can make socks.  They are the envy of the mob here.  Though we have not the need here for the fine underwear as we did on the Peninsular, they are very handy all the same.  They were the first lot I had received.  The other parcel was a tin of biscuits which were tres bon.  It's a long while since I had a decent feed of decent biscuits and as we were in the trenches when they arrived, they came in very handy.  Keep the socks coming along.  Cigars are very nice for a change too.  A good while ago in a letter to Father, I said I was sadly in need of a new shaving outfit, but I don't think he could have got the letter.  Will you please post it along for me.  A blade razor (not a safety) please and a strop etc., I hope you don't mind me telling you what I want, but these things are impossible to get here and are necessities of course   I don't know whether you call cigars a necessity or not, but I'm fed up of Army tobacco etc., and would like something to swank it with for a change.
No news this time.  Am feeling very fit after a bit of hard work.
I had a letter from Mr. Pauch the other day.  He drops me a line fairly often.  I wonder you could find time to go round and pay them a visit.  Also had a note from Mr. Rose.  He tells me they are going to put up a big Honor Roll at Hayfield.  Gee!  I'll be seeing my name on the Street Corners yet.
Love to all at Home.Your loving Son,Roy.
