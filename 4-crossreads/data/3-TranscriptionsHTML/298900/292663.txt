<p>by the New Zealanders who are doing good work.   Met Lance Todd, he being a Captain in the New Zealand A.S.C.   I happened to ask a patient if he knew him &amp; then sent my name up &amp; he came down to see me.    Later in the day I went up to his camp &amp; had a royal time.   About six other officers were present &amp; Lance in his old way telling stories etc kept the crowd laughing.    Wrote several letters during the evening.   Hun planes over during the night also day, one being very low but apparently got away safely.   Heard some particulars of our retreat which tends to prove that some of the Tommies put up a very poor show whilst others fought splendidly.   Unfortunately we arrived at a time when they were some demoralised &amp; our chaps have judged them accordingly.</p>
<p>Monday 1st April<br/>    Usual routine of sick parades.   Several Hun planes over during the day.   In the afternoon had a game of Hockey &amp; my team was once more victorious.  Paper news today gives the German official as 70,000 prisoners &amp; 1100 guns, some knock but we have repulsed him severely near Arras.</p>
