About the 18th or 19th a chang set in and the weather commenc to freez in real ernest , a heavi mist help to make thing just a littl more uncomfort than they might have been , but when the mist froze on the Tree , it made the place look rather pretti , and for awhil , I thought that we were in for a white Xmas , but a coupl of day , ago , a thaw start , and in the night the mist lift , and for the first time sinc we land here we were abl to see the countri round , now the weather is veri unsettl and there may be rain snow , or perhap it may be fine for Xmas . Tomorrow we will know for certain . now I am go to curl up in my blanket and go to sleep , for it is grow too cold
