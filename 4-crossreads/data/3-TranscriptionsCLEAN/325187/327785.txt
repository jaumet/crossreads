  
 [Wednesday 9 February 1916] 
 A draft of 40 men arrived today to fill the places of sick men  [Following paragraphs are crossed out] since we left the Aerodrome Camp. The leakage & waste even here is tremendous & a man is lucky to keep fit & well. One man of our field Ambulance died lately of Cerebro Spinal Meningitis I suppose brought from Australia. Mumps & Pneumonia & Measles claim most at present, but as a whole we are a healthy crowd & plenty of good Tucker for we Officers cooked on a Primus stove - as no wood on the Desert & the issue is all used by the men
