<p>Oct. 14th<br/>This morning I heard a rumour that the war was practically over.  At which I laughed scornfully.  However it seems pretty right from the news sheets of today.  Germany has apparently completely climbed down chiefly owing to pressure from her Allies I expect.</p>
<p>Tonight it is rumoured that Hostilities have ceased!!</p>
<p>In fact it has been a day of great news.  If this is true, now comes the really irksome part of waiting until we can get home.</p>
<p>Twill be some time too I am afraid.  There is no word of our moving from this flea ridden spot yet.  Though they can't stay here much longer, the 3rd Regt. is reduced to about 1000 [?] &amp; the other Regts. are not much better.</p>
