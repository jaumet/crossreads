<p>March, 1915<br/>Tuesday 16<br/>There are many improvements in communications in the field since I served in S.A. We have each day a portable Wireless station, in communication with Camp Head Quarters perhaps 20 miles off, which can be erected &amp; worked in 5 minutes, also 2 <u>Cable</u> detachments of 28 miles each, capable of being laid before the horses can move. Reconnaissance by Aeroplane etc:- and at night Helios for 10-15 miles keep winking on the Hills, these latter are of course nothing new.</p>
