<p>Have been trying for some time to find out the age of Amiens Catherdal &amp; Jock Mackie got it the other day for me.  She was constructed in the 13th Century by Jean de Lazarecks.</p>
<p>30th.  Last night all the Platoon Sergts. &amp; Officers had a confab in the Officers huts about our move to the firing line which is taking place this afternoon everything possible was thrashed out so things ought to run smoothly.</p>
<p>Rained very heavily early this morning &amp; the ground is flooded with water won't the firing line be in a pretty state.</p>
<p>No one is allowed to wear their puttees this trip they reckon they help to stop the circulation of the blood &amp; so bring on "trench feet" the 2nd Battalion have suffered very badly from all accounts over 80 cases of "trench feet" to about 30 other casualties</p>
