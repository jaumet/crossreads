16eternal truth that the influence of good outlives the influence of evil [indecipherable] would be very low about our future. But happily an ounce of gold outshines &amp; outlasts a ton of sewage.
Many good men talk of civil war before we shall get straight again. Many I know will never live again at home. But they are on the wrong course. We must see to it that the young mind, the generous responsive clear mind of the child, is fed upon the records of this wonderful fighting race of ours &amp; all will be well ever yet.
For the excessive length I can only plead that except my letters home I never will at all &amp; that in these days one must occasionally have an outlet &amp; a victim.
With kindest wishes to you allYours sincerely[A S [indecipherable]
