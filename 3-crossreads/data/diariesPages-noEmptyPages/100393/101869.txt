The Final Push.IntroductionThis narrative includes only my own experiences with the 4th Australian Infantry Battalion, and dates only from the beginning of this last big advance on the 8th August 1918 until the Armistice, 11th November 1918.All Australian battalions and units were in from the beginning of this push but held different sectors of the Allied front. I am only able to speak of those operations in which I took part, and hope that it will thoroughly interest those who read it.A Mc Vicker Smyth
