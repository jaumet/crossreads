Military CampDubbo28.3.16
Dear Ida,It has been decided that we are not to leave until next Wednesday, every man will be given the necessary training here and it is likely that we will not remain in Sydney more than two days.  I have applied for final leave and have got it, from tomorrow night until Monday morning .  I will get home tomorrow night and have a couple of days at home and then will go on to Sydney to see Clarry and Percy. I have wired to Clarry to see if he can get down on Sunday, if he cant I suppose I'll go onto Murdi.
When I asked for leave the Capt. told me that we would only be in camp in the show ground in Sydney for a couple of days so they mean to move us this time. I thought that I would lose my stripes but it will only be temporary as I will get them when we sail I think. You see no n.c.o.s  are supposed to be going this time but they are giving us a chance. I am sorry that they are splitting us up, only 150 of us going, it is a pity that the rest of our company are not going, some of my mates are going but I'm leaving some behind. Will keep all news till I get home
Hoping you are all o.k.With fond loveYour loving BroGordon
