22 Aug, 1916Train Cairo to AlexOut of quad at last.  Out into the street alive, alive with color & life.  It was a brisk trip in the motor waggon to the station & now we are bowling along on the Train right merrily  What a beaut it is after white wash walls & pyjamas.  On each side extend fields of rich green above it is bright blue.  here & there are drab villages with quiet shades of brown grey & orange only the dome of a mosque showing up with dazzling whiteness in the bright sun shine; patches of date palms with bunches of rich brown & wine colored clusters hanging, & in the field are the people working listlesly.
Along the road we pass some camels moving lazily, an Egyptian on a donkey, looking pompous under his big umbrella,  Above the horizon some clouds as soft looking & white as wool drift ceaslessly along & merge at last into a shimmer among the tree tops.  Egypt! unobstrusive, & quietly [indecipherable] [Line?] your Sphinx, camels, bright star flecked nights, & boundless sandy deserts.
