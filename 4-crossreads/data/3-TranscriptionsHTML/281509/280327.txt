<p>14 April 1916<br/>Friday</p>
<p>Tony &amp; self mess orderlies.  Still fine &amp; calm. Heat tempered by cool north west breeze.<br/>Nothing striking occurs except. a Sapper was sentenced to 5 days cell on bread &amp; water for refusing to go under hose after stable duty.  His excuse was a cold &amp; the fact of having one shower already.  Adjutant Laurence was prosecuter and odious man. Penalty far too drastic, merely vindictiveness on officers part.</p>
