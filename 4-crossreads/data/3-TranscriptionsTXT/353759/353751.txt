The generally accepted explanation is that the government feel that the money is more needed in Australia than by Australians abroad - which is damned unfair to us. Another explanation is that being the highest paid unit here jealousy by the French, but more by the Tommies is going to be stopped by reducing our pay to equal, or be more in proportion to them.
