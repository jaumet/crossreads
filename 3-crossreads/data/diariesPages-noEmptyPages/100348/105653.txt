My last day on fatigue; threw my last shovelful of gravel into the lorries marked "Road Repairs"; and marched with the Company this afternoon to "Melbourne" camp where we rejoined the Battalion. The usual preparations; issue of Bombs, Ammunition, etc; before proceeding to the trenches. Have received a parcel of goodies from home; am saving them for the "line"

Moved through a snow storm, via Montuban, to Bernafay Wood. Camped in little tarpaulin shelters for the night. A transformation has come over this area too. It is some comfort to know we are firmly consolidated here.
