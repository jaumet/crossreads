<p>Accomodation &amp; food equal to 2nd Class in any of the mailboats pre war time.  No doubt without an exception they are all very satisfied with the Transport's accomodation, food &amp; attendance.  There are very few hospital cases so far, 3 soldiers &amp; 2 wives.</p>
<p>22.7.19<br/>At 4 p.m. coaling finished, we proceeded on our way to Cape Town.  The weather being very muggy, yet sea very slight.  A dance was held at 8 p.m. on the 1st Saloon upper deck in which the majority enjoyed themselves immensely.</p>
<p>23.7.19<br/>The weather is still damp &amp; muggy yet the sea is practically smooth &amp; fine.  A fair amount sea sick of the wives &amp; a large amount of the soldiers similar.  The coal we obtained at St. Vincent is Welsh so they say, but of a very poor quality.  Consequently instead of keeping up 14&frac12; knots per hour as we formally done, we are doing only 12&frac14; knots.  But have a few more boilers to use as we are using 5 boilers so far out of 7 since we left London.  But the consumption of coal being high &amp; the distance to Cape Town from St. Vincent being 3981 miles so that coal is of a great consideration as well as water.  The Troops being on a limited amount of water per day enough without waste.  Noon this day, Lat. 13.46 N, Long. 22.56 W, dist. 236 miles.</p>
<p>24.7.19<br/>This day commenced with light winds, sea slight &amp; heavy rains, overcast &amp; cloudy.  Very muggy &amp; warm, Temperature 85 Degrees.  Lat. 9.46 N, Long. 19.39 W at noon, 3083 miles from London, 544 from St. Vincent &amp; 3402 miles to Cape Town.  Cricket &amp; various games, a concert at night.  Collection made towards a young married woman with 3 children.  Her husband failed to join the Transport at London,</p>
