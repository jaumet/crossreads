sleeping quarters last week, but it became so dreadfully hot down stairs that we determined to find a cooler sleeping-place and so last night we took our hammocks right up on to the top of the forecastle and slung them side by side from the railing to a pair of bosses just about 20 feet from the prow of the ship & with nothing overhead but the star-spangled canopy of heaven.By 9 o'clock we were hidden between the sides of our hammocks & were soon asleep on the deep' The air was delightfully fresh, even cold, & we rose at 5.30, feeling quite renewed in vigor. Needless to say, we intend sleeping there every night until we meet wet weather.
I have been made orderly for out table for this week & on that account am freed from all other duties & so J.D.M is to be seen all day long,
