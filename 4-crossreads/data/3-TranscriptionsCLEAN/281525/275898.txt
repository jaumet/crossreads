  
 18/10/17 Paris At 5 o'c I met Ella and we spent quite a long time in conversation. At 7 I left to try and find the Rest. Margeraux renowned for its fish but got hopelessly lost after much vain voyaging in the tube. Ended up at the Cafe de la Paix and dined there deriving much amusement from watching the old bucks with their little bits of skirt - bad old devils who ought to know better. The girls are now wearing hats a la Americaine not at all pretty. Big cigars and powerful motors seem to characterize the army of the U.S.A. The waiters in these Parisian cafes are comic, and very amusing are the overseers usually shapeless and podgy with good living. The carving is done by them - a good carver saves much money to the firm.
