[Comment written on the side of the page - Jack Somers Feb. 1933]
Billjim to some Critics
We'll own they smashed the Wuzza up,
And stoushed the Red caps black and blue;
We'll own they quaffed the festive cup,
And shickkered on the amber brew.
There's always a percentage strong. 
Of rowdy fools in every game,
But that don't make the good crowd wrong
Or brand the decent chaps the same. 
All "pushites" didn't stay at home
Some blatant bush skites hopped out too
Don't blame the lot because you find
In every hundred one or two. 
I've seen ?em dying puff a ?fag?
Bloody and tortured sport a grin
Heaped up beneath their country's flag
Piled with the dirt they died to win.
