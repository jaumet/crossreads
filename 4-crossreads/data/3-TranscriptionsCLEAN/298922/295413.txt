 The fight is going well & Regiment + 16 Officers are told off to escort prisoners to Cairo . We lost an aeroplane & both men killed this morning. All is well & the weather lovely at present. 
 Every afternoon we have football matches RUGBY - a game I never played being at school in Victoria it is making the men very fit & well. Looking back at the Military School it did us all good & served to shake together the Australian & English Officers,  who are always inclined to view each other from afar off & to criticize each other.
