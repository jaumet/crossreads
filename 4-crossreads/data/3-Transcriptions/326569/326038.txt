<p>time table from Uncle Fred at Barrow.</p>
<p>Wednesday, 11/4/17<br/>Rained heavily during night making parade ground very slushy &amp; slippery.  Half day off in afternoon as going on picquet at 6.30 p.m., consequently missed a route march.  About 9 p.m. party of men off "Wiltshire" arrived in camp.</p>
<p>Thursday, 12/4/17<br/>Heavy fall snow during night.  Paraded sick with a cold, but not much satisfaction with it.  Feel just as bad as ever, even after taking dose medicine &amp; having throat painted.  Received letter from Uncle Charlie in London.  Had to parade sick again at 5 p.m. feeling very crook &ndash; temperature 102.</p>
