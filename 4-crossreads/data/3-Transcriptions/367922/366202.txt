<p>Dear Professor<br/>I have been meaning to write to you long ago, but you would hardly credit what a nomadic existance we follow here. It is from village to village &amp; from there to the front line. While "in" the line we are not allowed to write, and while "out", the billets being usually barns or buildings of that nature, and our work being none the less for being "out", somehow time drifts on and we get very much behind in our correspondence.</p>
<p>But I'm always thinking of old times and wondering how long it will be before I'm back at the old work. I hope to start right where I left off but thats a long way ahead I'm afraid. While I was in England</p>
