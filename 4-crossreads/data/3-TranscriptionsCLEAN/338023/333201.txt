 Very busy getting fixed up. For goodness sake send me the address of some people in Melbourne. I don't care even if its only a chow or a policeman - so long as its somewhere   that  I can stop when on week-end leave. Melb. hotels charge 2/6 bed & 1/6 meals & we're only getting 2/- per day. Rail fare 4/2 is another item. 
 Love to all  longer letter when settled down. from Harry
