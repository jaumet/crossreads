<p>me more.   Glad that you admire it too.  Simpleness, gentleness, honour, and clean mirth become both sexes old and you[ng], as also those in every station of life.  Think you not so too?   [A line of Xs and Os.]</p>
<p>Oh yes my dears, much thinner than of yore. 'Tis good! As hard as nails and able for any work.   Too fat when I came here.   Best now.</p>
<p>The sphinx takes well on all occassions tell Maria his bulk &amp; fixity of tenure allows of little movement, no matter where the Camera be placed or how unsteady may be the operator.  The same may be written about the pyramid, the bulk whereof is greater than is that of its neighbour.</p>
<p>No letter from Pat Watt yet.   Naughty girl!!!   Tell Maria to convey my message to Strathfield.</p>
<p>My love to Maggie Phipps and the girls.  I hope to meet John Hare on this side some day.</p>
<p>Glad that M.M. Joe is still interested in my letters.</p>

'Tis well that you were interested in my letters, that recompenses me for writing them Oh yes, thin my dear &amp; better able to work, &amp; do my share of the allotted task in the great work.</p>
<p>Frank Fox &amp; his wife are made of the correct stuff.  The first duty of any woman's son is to fight for his duty and his country's cause.  At least so think I.   Where would the Nation be, how would the women fare were the men not ready and willing to fight in defence of ideals right or wrong?  They are but weaklings, breaks [brakes] upon the Coach of State, who are not ever ready to strike a blow for freedom or in self defence. A bas les tous.  Yes they are men of grit who wait not for an officers Commission.</p>
