 2-35 p.m.  Letters have been coming in all day but for me none has yet come. 
 Work stopped with us.  No new cases will be dealt with unless they be of extreme urgency. 
 I enclose a few sheets of thoughts that the Daily Telegraph might like to publish.  When you have read them send the manuscript on to the paper, and should it be published you might send me a copy, and also cut one out that it may be there when I return.
