<p>17 September 1916 Sun<br/>Did not get much sleep last night. Slept till dinner time &amp; then went over to the football field for a kick. Our team played one of the Canadian teams &amp; we won by 6 to nill. Megaphone It was a pretty rough game &amp; reminded me of old games down at Muka Rd &amp; the flats.</p>
<p>18 September 1916 Mon<br/>Raining very hard. I had leave from 7.30 am till 8.30 am. I went into Poperinghe with Griffs. Poperinghe is one of the largest villages we have been in. My first thing was to visit the baths. We pollished off sixteen fried eggs between us. Went to the [picture] whilst waiting I read one of the best letters I have ever received from Claude. I also had one from Mrs. Johnson.</p>
