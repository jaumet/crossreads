  
 This meant watering (about 3/4 mile) then in two lots, one after another  &  with other camp duties quite a full days work. I have the tent to myself tonight. JHK. has gone down for 24 hours to the Vet Corps to look after 6 of our horses these.  D.M. is in charge of the picket. The rest are at Alex. Very nice  &  quiet. I go to Alex. on the 13th the day after tomorrow. I don't anticipate a wildly amusing time but it should turn out better than Port Said.
