<p>Cairo.  Pension Wales.  21.2.16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recd 4.4.16.<br/>My very dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>A fortnight to-day we have been in Cairo or at least I have, and the last few days we have been together &amp; are just waiting for Rid to receive his instructions to join his unit.  I am so thankful to have him well again though he is not perhaps quite his old self yet.  To-day is Monday and he came out of Hospital last Wednesday afternoon so that we have had quite a nice long time together; it would have been much more satisfactory if we could have known something definite, for the way we have had to live daily &amp; hourly in expectation of his summons to duty has rather taken the edge off things.  On receipt of my letter to his new Commandant telling that he was ill &amp; could not report at the given date, there came back a telegram saying that he was to await instructions.  Still though it has been an unsettling time, it has been lovely to have the time together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Thursday, the day after he came out of Hospital, we went together to Zeytoun to look for Le &amp; Wal for ourselves.  We searched for Le and found that he was not there after all &amp; then inquired for Wal &amp; without any difficulty worth speaking of found him.  It was most delightful to see him again &amp; almost immediately he was able to get leave, &amp; came into Cairo with us to lunch &amp; to spend the rest of the day.  We thought we were "just the boys"! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wal looks well &amp; seems so but for a rather severe cold he has got, &amp; I think he is happy as far as it is possible to be under such circumstances.  His lieutenancy certainly affords him privileges worth having.</p>
