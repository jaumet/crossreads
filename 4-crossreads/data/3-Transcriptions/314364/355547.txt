<p>Thurs. Feb.13.<br/>Am taken off the night Job now &amp; put in charge of the Pack Stoves. It should be a fair Job if only I can get a decent place for a store. The Hospital is run on very "slip shod" lines, &amp; one is kept wondering what is going to happen next. Last night we had quite a decent Impromptu Concert on Deck. It seems strange that in spite of the enormous amount of money that has been subscribed to the Red X &amp; Comfort Funds this ship was allowed to leave Port without a Piano. The Music at last nights Concert was supplied by 2 Diggers  1 Cornet &amp; 1 Violin.<br/>There are quite a number of Scabies patients undergoing Treatment. Carson is attending to them &amp; I am issuing clean clothes. Dropped a few lines to Lill..<br/>Thurs. 13 (cont.)<br/>"Bluey" Downing &amp; I occupy one of the Hospital Cabins, which is very comfortable.<br/>The weather is good &amp; sea calm. The popular game of "House" &amp; this old "Crown &amp; Anchor" Board are much in evidence, &amp; the Diggers are keeping their [indecipherable] well circulating.</p>
