I have not yet mentioned our fishing parties.   At each anchorage all the prisoners would spend a lot of time fishing over the rails.   The lines were made from unravelled canvas;   the hooks from bent iron.   At Sunday Island, indeed, the Commandant actually allowed a party out in a boat to fish (on parole and with machine guns trained on them.   Also, there was method in his benevolence;   most of the fish was taken for the Germans!)
At the Maldives huge fish of the most brilliant colours were caught, gorgeous things weighing anything up to 50 lbs and coloured more brilliantly then parrots.
One species resembled an enormous bream and the scales were coloured in dazzling deep salmon tints.
As a rule each table caught fish for itself.
