Certainly there's any amount of growling but you can bet your life its not too bad at all, at all.
Got a cheery letter from Ede &amp; Phil the other day. They seem on a good wicket &amp; also mention that things are alright with you &amp; Al. I guess you're kept busy old man, but keep going. I hope to be a help to you when I get back, which may not be so long now Rumania is in. As for Al &amp; Ted give them my best love &amp; tell them I hope to be able to "do a bit" when I get back.
I wrote to Mrs Dye &amp; got a very kind invitation to Port Said, but owing to being invited on this stunt, I couldn't get there. I think Mrs Dye will have left for India ere this. She was due to leave about a month ago. I'm sorry as I would liked to have met them.
Give Clare my fondest regards also all the kiddies. My word they must be growing up. Hope Clare is absolutely OK. Also Alice. Got a letter from Vera Godkin. They all seem well. Lizzie is going well &amp; young Will's last photo showed him as a fine boy. They are in Adelaide.
Well old boss, more later. Paper very scarce just at present. Remember me to Bob and Bess Anderson will you also my old friends. Got a real splendid message from Jim Hebbard &amp; the Central chaps two mails ago.
Well old man you know the good things I wish you both adieu till we meet again
Your ever lovingly Will.
