A nice warm day. Went for a route march to the Sewerage Farm &ndash; some 3 miles from Zetouin Camp, saw some very fine machinery.
Have a sore heel, I think I have dislocated a small bone, giving me particular amusement &ndash; 2 Aeroplanes flying over Camp. Mere detail to see a train of Camels 5 miles long.
Never went anywhere at night, tired &amp; went to bed early.
Very cold at night.
