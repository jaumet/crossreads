usual crowd of halt and lame. Small girl with no arms very persistent in thrusting the stumps before us. Quite a number of diseased human wrecks crouched in filthy rags on ground too comatose even to beg.
Through a garden and across more rubbish heaps to the Greek Church. The original church is now in ruins, and the new one in circular form is on top. The ascent is up a spiral staircase. Watched a service to conclusion ? apparently cross between Church of England Roman. Congregation consisted of one girl who confessed afterwards. The place reeking with incense. From the balcony a fine view is obtained. Directly beneath is old Cairo ? a mass of filthy hovels, many nearly roofless and those with roofs have them covered with lumber and household rubbish. The people are little better than beasts to exist under these conditions. Men and women alike attend to the functions of nature on the spot ? no sanitary ideas are given effect to. Human excreta lying all round and the ground and walls
