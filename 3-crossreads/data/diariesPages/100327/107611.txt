falling in Reg. office. Heavy rifle fire on left probably shell fire covering an advance. I am sitting on 3 boxes of the most powerful bombs on the Peninsular so if anything hits here it is "cuckoo". 75's taking dirt off parapet just in front in their skimming flight. Siege battery pouring high explosive into enemy's Johnstone Jolly's trenches. All our guns belching out. Their shells skimming past at rate of one a second from 75's alone.
A brisk morning; - and a pair of little birds singing as if no war or bloodshed was on. Eight or 9 shells bursting round here simultaneously. Bombs going right and left. Nothing from warships yet. Both Turks and ourselves in the dugouts. Heavy firing round Cape Hellas. Splinters still catching us here. Aeroplanes up registering shots. In firing line sandbags and traverses much cut about owing the shells landing ? one stripped a rifle of all wood work and charged magazine but left in the chamber the unexploded cartridge. Noise big factor.
All ready for gas attack any time always carry little bag slung over shoulder with a gas helmet in it with mica eye shield. Chemical in helmet neutralise effects of the gas by turning it into salt. Also respirator. Both damp with the chemicals. Sock wrung out in it is a good antidote. Gas sprayers for driving the gas back and special men for their manipulation all ready for use.
1043 Very quiet now save for an occasional rifle shot echoing down the valley. Abdul showing bayonets over his parapets for a while but everything now returned to normal.
Delightful day, beautiful sun and blue calm seas. The two isles of the blest lying peaceful
