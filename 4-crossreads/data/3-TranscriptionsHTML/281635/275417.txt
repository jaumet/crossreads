<p>all the difficulties I slept very well having on all clothes boots etc &ndash; feet were cold all night though.<br/>11/10/17 Have been busy drying blankets etc. Then we rigged up a tent &amp; cleaned rifles, bayonets, Lewis guns etc. Fell in 6pm for inspection then had stew &amp; at 6.45pm moved off to front line in single file. I started off with 4 panniers of ammunition for Lewis Gun but soon broke down with its weight so Henry (the officer) took 2 panniers &amp; Andy 2. About &frac12; hr after took 2 off Andy &amp; took them right into action. Had very rough march in dawn up</p>
