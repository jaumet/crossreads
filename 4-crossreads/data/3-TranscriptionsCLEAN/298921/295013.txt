  
 February, 1915 Tuesday 9 Met Col White of Gen Staff & went Ordnance at Citadel the most beautiful morgue built by Mohammed Ali, it was here that the Mamluk were invited to dine & then were murdered, I cannot describe the Alabaster columns, Marble floor & colored glass all most beautiful, it is the Tomb of the Rhedive. Many dying beggars hanging around & starving - Came back & had Bath at Shepherds Hotel & paid men in the evening - quite a brain worry converting LSD into Piastres. Much sand blowing today.
