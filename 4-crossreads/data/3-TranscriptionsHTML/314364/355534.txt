<p>Tues.Jan. 7 (cont.)<br/>Met Pete H. again after Dinner. We went up to the Aldwych Threate, which is an "Aussie [indecipherable]" . Sat &amp; listened to the music for a while, then I had to "buzz off" &amp; catch my Train at Waterloo. Travelled as far as Wareham in company with a party of Canadian Tank Corps. They were good company. Arrived at Upway about 10.30, where we were greeted by two greasy "Jacks" who demanded to see our passes. Then I strolled slowly &amp; sadly back to "Stew soaked" Littlemoor.<br/>Wed.8. Stew for Breakfast. Felt so disgusted I refused to get up. Got 2 letters. 1 from Mother &amp; 1 from B.E. that made things a bit better. Mother says Lill is looking bonnie which I'm sure is very excellent news. Put in for Pass to go to Westham to see about getting on a Boat Roll &amp; also to make enquiries about that cape I handed in, but for which I am charged the sum of 15/3.</p>
<p>Thur. Jan.9.<br/>Got a aride to Westham in Ambulance which broke down several times on the way but still this was far better than walking, as, of course, it was raining. Saw [indecipherable] Taylor &amp; Jack Cox both of whom had just returned from Leave. Also saw the Q.M.Sgt who gave me a note to say that I <u>did</u> hand in my waterproof cape when I was in Westham last May. Took the letter I got from Ted Sutton to the Guy in the Medical Hut, who said "You are too late for the [indecipherable] but I'll put you on the [indecipherable]. "That'll do me" I said. She is supposed to sail about the 20th so I must rest my soul in patience how till I can get aboard. Hope to the Lord it comes off alright, or B.E. will think I am going wrong in the head, after saying I am coming home so many times, &amp; then to miss.<br/>Had Tea in the Staff Hut &amp; returned to Littlemoor feeling that I had done a good day's work.</p>
