carried out a very successful attack, capturing a few & killing a lot of the enemy - quite a brilliant little shew well carried out - the Bn. is still very full of fighting spirit - these affairs tend to undermine the Hun & upset his plans & shews him he has a superior fighting man to deal with.I dont think I told you about the following, if so I am sorry to repeat.The last time I was in about 3 or 4 weeks ago the old hun tried to raid one of my posts - he first put down a 25 minute barrage & then came over about 60 strong - I happened to be going round at the time on the usual nightly inspection & reached the post next to the one he was after - when he started his shooting. You should have seen the way the boys tuned up that raiding party I was as pleased as a dog with a dozen or so tails. The officer in charge of the post was called Purdon he was in my section at Kensington you may have met him - talking about the section we are only 3 now, 2 captains & 1 Lieut.I am giving your address to a Captain G H Mann M.C. of ours he is going back sick. I hope he calls on you he is a very fine chap & an old tried friend of mine.We are sending a few old hands back to Aussy for furlough so far this doesnt
