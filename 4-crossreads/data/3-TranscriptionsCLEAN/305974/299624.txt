26 MondayRaining nearly all day.  4 days leave started allowing 25% to go at a time. Went for a long route march during the morning.  Received letters from Home, Olive Turner 2, George Handley, Florence Whitehead, 1 & 1 from Doris.  I wrote a letter to Florrie during the afternoon.  Looking forward for some money to go on leave with.
27 TuesdayA very dull day  No.1 section detailed for duty. I managed to scale all fatigues, including doing guard.  Done some printing in the afternoon.  A great argument started about the different states of the Commonwealth, well in fact it got that heated that the staff sergeant of the guards had to come & quell it.
28 WednesdayDetailed for duty at headquarters in the morning, & was called out in the afternoon to go back again, but I scaled them & done some printing instead, which turned out real good.  I also done some developing at night which didn't turn out too bad.  There has been 3 cases of meningitis since our arrival here.
