<p>while looking for curio's<br/>We had no tents to speak of for nearly a week after landing here &amp; it was pretty cold sleeping out side for it drizzled nearly every night &amp; wet us through.<br/>This part of Egypt is practically the same as any other part I have seen the same old canals &amp; plenty of them, droves of camels &amp; donkeys  &amp; etc.<br/>The staple food of these people  seems to be sugar cane wherever you see them they will be eating this rotten stuff, I can't stand it myself, we made it a welter on the oranges &amp; mandarins for a while for we were just longing</p>
