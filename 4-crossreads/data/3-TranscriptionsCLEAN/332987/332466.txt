Terrific bomb dropping by the enemy during the night.  Already we have moved from three wagon lines, just at dark, and other troops have taken them over, were bombed awful, and had heavy casualties in men and horses.  The Germans are putting a desperate struggle.  Our aeroplanes are having a lot of trouble with his, he has now rings with a little black cross in centre, making it difficult for our people to pick him up.  He has caught several of our baloons with planes so marked. 
 13-8-1918 The advance hung up.  Weather hot and dry.  Night bombing by the enemy still severe.  He opens fire on horse lines with his machine gun.  Still shelling villages and roads in rear.
