<p>June 18<br/>214.<br/>Talking awhile to Frank D.:  Basil is preparing another "Ghutz" and wants a back page:  so will probably do again last night's sketch of one of the big windmills by Sylvestre Cappel.</p>
<p>No mail, and an uninteresting day, further evidence of a coming attack with Hazebrouck as an early objective.</p>
<p>Mr. Priestly has gone away for a short rest, and from R.V. Corps a cold cultured Tommy, heavy lidded, wasp-waisted, and the manner of a minor royalty newly elected by a blinded people, has taken his place.</p>
<p>215.<br/>Last night dreamed for second time of late of the Boche bombing us at Bondi, a curious dream of a hundred changes.</p>
<p>216.<br/>Re entry 127 &ndash; Tonight I reread it lazing through old entries:  it was merely an entry closely following an issue of rum, so I blacked it out.</p>
<p>Years ago in an old exercise I once started a journal of books read, and their personal appeal, going into camp I destroyed part of it, perhaps the whole book, but I forget.  But I destroyed it for one entry before others.  Coming to the ending of the first of Pater's "Imaginary Portraits", I knew how fully that concluding sentence applied to myself, still it does, but reading it, I wrote a confession of its truth, and a growing desire to surrender fully to the Catholic Church, to put away desire and the world, and to find a silent comeliness and beauty.</p>
<p>Now I am without religion, and I know now it is in her wisdom that Rome will only have compleat surrender, far too personal an attitude is allowed amongst the protestants &ndash; it seems even amongst our congregations there is a mutual criticism and an unexpressed wonder at the individual's belief.</p>
<p>So I seek my soul's salvation in Beauty and poetry, and now I am dead if I have not one or the other, and still there comes the desire to have the benediction of Rome, and the peace after the confession.</p>
<p>Would I then be happier?  But perhaps that peace would pass, and all quietness too.</p>
