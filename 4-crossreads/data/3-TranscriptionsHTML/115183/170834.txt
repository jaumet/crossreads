<p>(68)<br/>1st July 1917. For the past week I had been employed on various fatigues but mostly as cook's offsider, peeling spuds, washing dixies, filling the hosters,,stirring the sago and so on. On this day our (C) section took over the M.D.s (it being no longer a corps M.D.S.) and I was detailed as offsider in the dispensary where I spent the next week from 8.15 am to 8 pm (more or less) sweeping out the place washing bottles, annoying the staff sergeant dispensers or running for their water for coffee, or writing up my diary as on page 10. Of course I knew enough about the drugs to fix up many of the customers.<br/>2 July 1917. On this day we heard that Major General Holmes had been killed near Khandahar Farm ADS (which we afterwards came to know well) while accompanying Billy Holman on a tour of inpection. Naturally Billy was much shaken up and Australia lost one of her leading military men the commander of the 4th Division.<br/>4th July 17 Being previously warned in the afternoon we walked over to the old Neuve Eglise &ndash; Bailleul road and saw pass by in their cars</p>
