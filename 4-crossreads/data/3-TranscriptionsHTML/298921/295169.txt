<p>July, 1915<br/>Saturday 17<br/>July nearly gone I see Cuth Fetherstonbrough's name in the 12 L.H. just arriving, full of enthusiasm I suppose.<br/>I am joining these leaves together with a thorn the same kind as our Saviour was crowned with. You will see it is different to what I grew in my Garden <strike>at Maribyrnong</strike> -<br/>Had a letter from Jack Mother giving me Berties &amp; Ruperts' addresses &ndash;<br/>So the Papers say the War is to be over by October. I think October 12 months will be nearer the mark.</p>
