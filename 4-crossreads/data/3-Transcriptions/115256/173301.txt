<p>Thursday 11 February 1915</p>
<p>The usual parades this morning and a blanket inspection after dinner.  This resulted in the discovery of several "sharks" who had taken more than their share of blankets, thus leaving their comrades (?) to pass the bitterly cold nights without sufficient covering.  But I suppose this sort of petty thieving and "pointing" is typical of the "Surry Hills push" in the battalion.</p>
<p>I received my first batch of letters and papers to-day.  And how I enjoyed reading each line of those letters from my nearest and dearest, away, a long way away in Sydney!  The letter written to me by my dearest little Mater, was the most beautiful letter I ever remember having read.  Sentiment is no doubt one of the ruling forces of the whole world.  It is not very apparent in a military camp, but thank God I had not lost all my sentimental instincts as not to be touched by every little idea contained in that letter &ndash; all her little worries as to my health, warm clothing, her reminder of her continual thoughts of myself ---  To-night I shall dream that I am in Paradise, Paradise, at home with my loved ones!</p>
