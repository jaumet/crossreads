  
 Queens is that we have to go down to our meals which we have in big marquees, & they are much better meals also have to make our own beds & clean the little room out, this is done in 15 min's so you can see there is not a great deal to do, the only drawback in my opinion is that we all have to wear suits of blue, Kahki is not allowed to be worn, we have a pair of blue pants & blue tunic, white shirt, & red tie, & of course as much underclothing as you may require while we wear our own Australian boots & hat, we don't mind so long as we have got our hats they are every thing to an "Aussie" for no matter what he is dressed in his hat will always proclaim his nationality & I dont think that you can find anyone more
