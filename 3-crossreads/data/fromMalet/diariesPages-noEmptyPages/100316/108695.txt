Waterloo
Behind a crest the Guard was massed
The Guard! Supreme hope supreme thought!
"Go! give us the Guard", he cried 
And lancers, grenadiers with gaiters drill
Dragoons who Rome had taken for legionaires
Lifeguardsmen, cannoniers who trained the thunders
Wearing black colbeck or Polish head-dress
All, those of Friedland those of Rivolc
Understanding they were going to die in this fete
Saluted their God standing upright in the tempest
Their mouths with one sole cry said "Live the Emperor!"
Then with slow step, music at the head, without fury
Tranquil, smiling at the English fire
The Imperial Guard entered into the furnace
Alas, Napoleon leaning on his Guard
Watched and as soon as they had debouched
Under the black cannons spitting jets of sulphur
Saw one after the other in this horrible whirlpool
Meet these regiments of granite of steel
As melts a cinder in the breath of a brazier
They went their arms sloped, erect, grave stoic
Not one returned. Sleep, heroic dead!
Victor Hugo
(The Punishment)
