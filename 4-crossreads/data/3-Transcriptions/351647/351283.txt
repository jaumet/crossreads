<p>look after &amp; do my bidding.  It is quite the worst &amp; most worrying job I have had yet &amp; I shall have to get nasty.</p>
<p>I had a note from Joe Kirby the other day.  I expect he wrote you &amp; told you of his brother Bob's death.</p>
<p>I really must fly as the man is leaving with mail &amp;c.  I'm so sick of writing you scrappy disconnected letters but I hope you will understand.  I'm still well &amp; healthy but too busy to worry whether I'm unhappy or not.</p>
<p>My love to the Boss &amp; Graham, Mac &amp; very much to yourself my dear friend.  You are a brick.  The sweater is just great.  I'm dying to get back home.</p>
<p>So long,<br/>Wilkie.</p>
