  
 5 Did you get a letter from me describing something about shooting at aeroplanes etc I wrote that when in the convalescent depot at Cayux 
 Cayux is not far from the mouth of the Somme 
 On being discharged from the convalescent depot at Cayux I was sent back to Etaples as repaired and fit for further active service 
 Etaples is our base in France. It is the place where I spent the first few weeks in France training for the front. 
 Well on finding myself back there I immediately asked to be sent on to my company (the 12th Field Coy Engineers), but was told such a practical proceeding was impossible
