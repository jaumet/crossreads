  
 Sunday 6 August 1916 A glorious Sabbath day, but rather warm. In the morning a Church Parade of the brigade was held by our two C. of E. chaplains, one of whom preached from Joshua 1:9. The General was present & it was a good service, though the brigade was sadly depleted in numbers. Spent most of the remainder of the time letter-writing, in the afternoon having a surprise visit from Rid as he returned from holding some services.
