<p>Here Jerrom and I are upon this wharf No. 45 awaiting the arrival of a ship, the Ismailia to convey us across the water.</p>
<p>We were ordered for 10 a.m. but the ship is not yet near the wharf, nor does any one here know of her whereabouts. We were just up to time.</p>
<p>Letters were posted to you this morning. Not a letter was left unanswered by me, I therefore feel happy in regard to my correspondence. Please thank those of my friends for writing. Amongst the last to whom envelopes were addressed by me were Sister Mary Borgia, &amp; Mr. Hennessy.</p>
<p>The baggage, four packages, will be called for today and they will be stored at.<br/>The Headquarter Stores<br/>First Division<br/>Mustapha<br/>Alexandria.</p>
<p>One package, a suit case, belongs to Jerrom, the other three are mine. A list went in the letter posted to you this morning.</p>
