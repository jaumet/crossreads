<p>We went for a <strike>bu</strike> ride on top of a bus to see London and it was fine. The weather was a trifle cold. One thing very noticeable over here is. The colder the weather is the rosier the girl's and children's cheeks become. I have a fine room and a bed fit for the gods to sleep in My breakfast is brought up to me in bed if I require it. I have a rather rotten cold and I am being looked after like an only son.</p>
