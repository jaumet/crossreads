Friday 14th July.
Had a very busy day chiefly rearranging the dispensary.  Quite a lot of empty bottles & other gear had been allowed to collect and the place was in somewhat of a mess so I got right into it & squared the whole show up, a job I rather enjoy & am getting quite used to.  We have a dispensary complete enough to run a hospital with instead of a rest camp.  The afternoon was quiet & I managed to write several letters which required answering.
Saturday 15th JulyOrdinary routine work mostly & that rather moderate. Went through all the wards & inspected their medicines discarding old stuff & taking a list of what remained.  I then formed a list with index complete so I could see at a glance what each ward contained.  No sooner was this completed than I had word we had to shift once again.  I had been for a walk to the No. 2 CCS new station at "Steenwerck". They had formed a camp under the supervision of an R.E. man & were just completed ready for patients.  Half of the tents were stained brown & half green
