A cold night and the "stand to" was in pitch dark ? mud clinging everywhere. Still feeling unwell so did not go for swim. Heard later that wind and rough water caused considerable rise in tide mark, washed away two piers, dislocated water apparatus and threatens store stacks. Wrecked ketch turned turtle . Barges adrift and tossing about Everyone put on half rations only  a gallon of water per day being issued to each man 
Little scheme on the C ? failed to reach fruition. The Turks got in first and blew us up, however their Engineers were a few feet out and no damage resulted. We will concoct another scheme. Meantime where they least suspect underneath them is sufficient to blow a few of Islam's disciples to the deepest hell, - just waiting to be touched off. Man named Reid "C" Co. missing. Disappeared last night at 2300 left all equipment deserted his post and cannot be found. Men speak of groans heard over parapet but nothing in sight this morning This man was blown clean off firing step the other day by a shell but was absolutely unhurt since then he has not been quite rational. 
Turk crept up to 21st lines last night, probably to surrender. They let him poke his head right over parapet and then blew his face off ? buried him this morning. Bullet caught one of the burial party in the leg, they took him to hospital Shell landed in hospital blew them all out, 3 wounded. Hotham, Fraser and Gaunt all dead. Keeping correspondence with hospital as evidence of difficulty in eliciting information
