<p>NOV. &nbsp; FRIDAY 10 &nbsp; 1916</p>
<p>Fine &amp; warm. Took the guns &amp; waggons out in morning &amp; the guns went into action &amp; the waggons had a battery drill under Lieut Jordan &amp; he is a great fellow &amp; knows his work well. Its a treat to work for him after being fooled about by coves who know less than yourself. Cleaning harness all the afternoon. Poss &amp; self &amp; Charley Scott went down to 28 Camp to see Joe Clonan &amp; Pop Lloyd but they had a big dinner on in the mess &amp; we did not see them. Got letter from father 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Sept.</p>
