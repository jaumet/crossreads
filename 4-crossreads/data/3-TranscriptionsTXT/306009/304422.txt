 1915 Aug. 26 Thu. Every evening after tea I go for a walk somewhere, usually on the Island &amp; round about Kasr-el-Nil. Sunday afternoons I have been spending either with a visit to the Armenian Scouts, Church &amp; Esbekieh Gardens &ndash; or trotting round with Ben Champion &amp; Art. Felton as a kind of amateur guide.
