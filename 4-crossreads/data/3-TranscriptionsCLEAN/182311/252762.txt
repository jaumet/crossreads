 of our boys have from time to time been working on Coal Trimming; this week volunteers were again called for but no response, so three officers of "A" Coy. sent their names in and asked who would come with them.  Result, the whole Company almost rushed it so that all we did was to pick the strongest and arrange the three reliefs, one under each officer.  Then down for our two hour turn in the bunkers, shovelling, throwing and wheeling coal, with the heat from the engines making the bunkers suffocatingly warm; the fine dust from the coal adhered to our sweating bodies until we quite lost our colour and our identity too and became black men, yes coal-black men too. 
    Yes, there were some incidents, a rat which we pursued, pelting it with coal, ran under a pile of coal, breaking away and carrying a man's spade down through a chute, my climb in between decks to find it, and finally when we reached the deck the relentless pursuit by amateur photographers until we stopped and posed, when dozens of cameras clicked, mine was carried by one of the men, I must let you have the result.  I liked the work, but Oh! Goodness, it took nearly three-quarters of an hour to clean up and I missed my lunch too. 
    Today is Saturday, we have just had an Officer's Tug of War, Company against Company, good fun and my word the men do appreciate a little bit of entertain-ment like this. 
    Photography is now the absorbing subject,
