 Lots of love   &amp;  kisses for your dear little self. XOXOXOXOXOXOXXXXXXOXO 
 My darling Eddy, 
 We have had a sample of hot weather to-day   &amp;  now it is blowing hard &ndash; Hope we will soon get out of here, do not wish to spend another summer here. I am on night-duty   &amp;  sleeping very well in the day-time. Tell Grandma I'm getting quite fat again   &amp;  give her a big kiss   &amp;  hug for me.  From Auntie Eadle
