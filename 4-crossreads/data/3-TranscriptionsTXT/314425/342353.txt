 Sunday Dec. 8. 1918. 28. There is nothing doing this morning. There has been no parades and no roll call. Most of the lads are very pleased at the prospect of getting away so quick. But a few of us will be greatly disappointed if we do not get leave. It was my own fault I should have taken it when I had the chance, but my object in the delay was to have Christmas in Ireland during my leave. I wrote to Mr Fischer today explaining my case and asking him to see if he could get me leave. 
 Monday Dec. 9. 1918. 29. The weather is dull and cloudy today. We are very well fed here. About 10. o'clock we were paraded the roll called for this ward &amp; then paraded to the A.M.C. Hut and examined by a doctor for classification. I wrote to Mr Hughes about my leave but I have not much hope og getting it. Several others have also written. 
 Tuesday Oct. 10. 1918. 30. Cold &amp; showery. I am in BIB categatory as the result of the examination yesterday. We attended a dental parade this afternoon.
