<p>news is told us that we one of the men who left our vessel at Hobart had been taken ill and we were all suspected contacts of small pox.</p>
<p>But a word about our beautiful Harbour.&nbsp; It is a veritable paradise;&nbsp; a gift of Nature of which we may well be proud.&nbsp; It is the only Harbour I have seen for 3&frac12; years.</p>
<p>We could appreciate it more, and rhapsodise at greater length, only for the thoughts of North Head!</p>
