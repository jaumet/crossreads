<p>many things which made life bearable, had it not been for the Y.M.C.A. On coming out of the trenches, invariably&nbsp;the first place one sees is probably a dug-out or some shanty, where it is possible to obtain refreshment and cigarettes. You are tired, miserable, dirty and wet, and it is a god-send to be able find a place where you are given something warm. This is what I have seen of the Y.M.C.A.</p>
<p>Then we go into the back areas and we find again the Y.M.C.A. in evidence, &quot;running&quot; a canteen, the prices being much lower than it is possible to obtain the stuff elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You come to London on leave, the same thing happens, you find any amount of Y.M.C.A. huts, where you can obtain beds, and good meals, at a cost far, very far below the ordinary restaurants, and boarding houses. It has been stated to me that they have made a profit on their meals, well that does not worry me, I am not quite such as fool as to pay 3/6 for the same article I can get for 1/5. If they made a profit, more power to them. They had voluntary attendants, I am told. Well that&#39;s nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>To return to my story. One early morning as we waited outside the Y.M.C.A. dug-out, a shell fell practically in the midst of the crowd, a yell for stretcher bearers (a few of these always accompanied a fatigue party) - I always &quot;take my hat off&quot; to a stretcher bearer, for such a combination of bravery and gentleness it is hard to find) which was at once responded to, another shell came perilously close, so, many of us decided that we really didn&#39;t want any cocoa that night, &amp;&nbsp;&quot;stood not in the order of our going&quot;, but &quot;beat it&quot; for all we were worth.</p>
