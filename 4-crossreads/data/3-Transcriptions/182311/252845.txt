<p>firm paths; &amp; the air once so cold has now a warmth which really reminds one of the early summer of Australia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The small birds have become quite noisy&nbsp; Skylarks are sonstantly heard &amp; in the areas between &amp; behind the trenches our lads are shooting hare &amp; partridge to supplement their rations; I am living in hopes of hearing the nightingale in the hedges at twilight but perhaps tis too early for that sweet singer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &#39;Tis somewhat early for the trees but the buds swelled quite large seem to be only waiting for a signal to burst &amp; clothe the naked limbs of the trees which have been indecently bare all the time that we have been in France.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And how does the spring affect the war, well</p>
