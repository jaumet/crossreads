<p>Tuesday 19 June 1917.</p>
<p>Reveille at 5 a.m. Went up on deck and land is now to be seen on either side. We are now in the Straits of Sinai. Land rugged and of a limestone sandy formation no vegetation.<br />Speed slow and boats to be seen the whole day. Through these Sts we passed Sinai and were then in Gulf of Suez.<br />Arrived in Suez harbor at 6.15 pm. Launches came alongside with naval &amp; military officers.&nbsp;2 aeroplanes were circling over a number of very large oil&nbsp;<s>drums</s>&nbsp;tanks on coast &amp; apparently guarding them.<br />Dropped anchor at 7. pm. In harbor is a sunken boat with bridge only showing. A pretty sunset noted.</p>
<p>Disembarkation tomorrow morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Another case of C.S.M. at 11 pm?)</p>
