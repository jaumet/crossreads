<p>The Hyderabad Lancers who are camped alongside us gave a great display of tent-pegging etc By Jove they are clinkers, and look as if they would stop at nothing. They are Indian troops but lent to Great Britain for the length of the war. I have met several of their officers, some of whom are "Jams" &amp; "Maharajas" and all sorts of "kunts" in their own country. Only the Commanding Officer and his A.D.C. are Englishmen.</p>
<p>Weather is still very mild here but cool enough at nights. Everything in camp is going on much the same. Although we are going through a sort of transformation at present, having to send a number of our old hands to these new Divisions as a nucleus, and taking in reinforcements ourselves to fill the gaps &ndash;</p>
