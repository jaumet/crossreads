As soon as it was daylight it commenced to rain heavily so I went inside.  Then I went down the road & looked over the cottage which is about a quarter of a mile nearer Fletre.  A shell had smashed almost a whole side of it, & with the rain dripping outside & half of the inside, the effect was very eerie in the half light with ghostly tappings & drippings. . . .
