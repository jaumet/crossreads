A statement given to us today said that matters were improving & that the situation would shortly be well in hand.    The weather today very cold.   Had a parade at 2 P.M. full marching order for a rehearsal the final orders being that we march out at midnight to entrain, our destination being not far from Doullens.    It will be a cold move.
