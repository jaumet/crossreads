<p>17 Friday<br/>We buried six poor beggars yesterday who had either been killed in action or died of wounds.  About 8 am A section went up to the East Flers dressing station, it is about 1&frac12;  miles behind the line.  There are shells bursting all round us, Fritz is putting a good few over.  We are camped in dug outs here I saw the German airoplane that was brought down yesterday, also a ":tank" which got stuck in the mud here.</p>
<p>18 Saturday<br/>It snowed nearly all night &amp; this morning.  Everywhere is all white with snow.  It rained nearly all day &amp; was terribly cold.  We went down for water in the morning &amp; took a patient down in the night, a trip I will never forget, we were up to our waist in mud nearly all the way, it was terrible.  We carry for about 800 yds then we wheel by a trolly for about a mile.</p>
