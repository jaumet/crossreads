 Dear Mother 
 I have just received a large & interesting mail from Australia, seven altogether & a bosca big parcel from Mrs West or St. James Red Cross.  The letters were No. 15 & two (No. 16) sixteens from you, a very nice one from Dora and from Bob Ingram, Aunt Jean & Jean.  We may get some more yet.  Last week I got one from Woody which came through Aunt Greta & therefore got here a few days earlier.  With it came a parcel of a muffler, pair of socks & mittens from Rene.  This is the biggest wait for mail we have had yet, three weeks since the last & only a couple came then so there it is quite 6 weeks since the last good mail.  I suppose the delay was caused by the strike but one does not mind waiting so long as they turn up in the end.
