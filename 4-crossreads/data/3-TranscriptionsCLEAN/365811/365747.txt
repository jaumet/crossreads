  
 4. About a month ago I paid another short visit to Paris. It is a wonderful city - some of the buildings and boulevardes are beautiful - and I am sorry to hear the Huns have been bombarding the place with that mysterious long range gun. 
 Quite a lot of our Australians now have seen Paris - leave there was very liberal. The city retains a lot of its old brightness in spite of the war - the authorities seeming to be anxious to make it as pleasant as possible for the many troops - especially colonials - visiting there on leave. I went to the Opera one evening and saw Faust - the Opera House is of course a magnificent building and I hope it never stops a bomb - hostile bombing is  of course  part of the routine
