of the Isle of Wight where anchor was dropped just off Cowes. 
6th August
Torrential downpours during morning improving to bright sunshine in the afternoon. We lay at anchor just off Cowes. Irritated by the beautiful landscape of the Isle of Wight, for we were unable to go ashore. Cowes ia indeed a beautiful little township, surrounded by lawns like green carpets. During the afternoon, a vessel was towed in which had been either torpedoed or mined. We were further interested by numerous sea-planes and aeroplanes, stunting and training in the vicinity.
