26/9/15 Sunday. Lovely day but stench from buried dead penetrating everywhere. Put party on to cover up any limbs c sticking out. Aegean Sea a remarkable sight this morning not a breath of wind and the water all striated and in patches the craft lying idle and those with smoke have it going straight up in the air. The currents can be traced eddying round in a remarkable manner. A warship standing close in to shell the German officers trenches. C.O. struck a surprise packet today. Asked one man his occupation. Drapers Assistant C.O. remarked "rather effeminate". Man: "I was in hosiery and always found it emphasized my masculinity! Sir". Taube aeroplane overhead now dropping bombs. Most like a bird ? but more similar to a hawk than the dove it takes its name from. Padres running round like lost sheep looking for their congregations. Men all on duty ? very difficult for them to get to church even if they wanted to go. Jack just passed marching a squad down to draw bombs. Looking well, will be in this afternoon. Fatigues sweating up the slopes carrying boxes on their shoulders looking like ants clinging on the hillsides. Killing work carrying every drop of water round of ammunition up these heights and wears the men down to the bone. Oilstoves being supplied to keep the trenches warm in winter.
