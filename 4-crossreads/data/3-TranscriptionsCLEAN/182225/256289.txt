JUNE   MONDAY 19   1916
A fine warm day. Its just great to get into some warm weather again. With the exception of our two days in Durban its the first time I have felt properly warm since leaving Sydney. We got our kit bags up from the hold in the morning and stacked them on our troop deck. Lay in the sun in the afternoon after about five minutes physical culture.
