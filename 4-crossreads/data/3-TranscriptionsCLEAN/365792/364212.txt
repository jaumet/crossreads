  
 May 8 fall in 6.45, dinner 12, fall in 1 pm, tea at 4 pm. Some of the boys get fatigue, such as filling sand bags etc but im not looking for work 
 9 Rain, rain, rain, all day yesterday & again today, & damn cold too. Tea, ham, bread butter & jam for brek, & then we fell in for Roll Call. This chick was put on fatigue cleaning up the lines, but he didn't do very much cleaning up. Fell in at 10 for sick parade & heard what the Quack has to say for himself. Not a bad Canteen, tea etc '1, & cakes 11/2 each. Women from England are running it. Theres a "Gussy" Eng' Cpl; on my right but he's going away today. Went before the Doc at 10.30 & have to be boarded in a couple of days. Hope to get through OK. Went down town again in the rain & had a look round. Cant see too much though with only one eye.
