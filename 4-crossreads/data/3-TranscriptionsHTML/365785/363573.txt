<p>commit all sorts of offences and spend their time in the "clink".  I really think it is worth one's while to be a T.T. but often one gets very sick of rusty water &amp; the tea made therefrom &amp; longs for a glass of beer or a wh. &amp; s.  I am not a T.T. here but I am glad to be able to say that I have not been the worse for drink so far.<br/>Australian letters are the greatest assistance in keeping one on the straight in any direction in the army &amp; that is why I appreciate them so much.<br/>Thanks so much for writing.  Give my love to Margaret &amp; Mifanwy &amp; Peter (whom I have not yet seen).</p>
<p>Very affectionate regards to Dr. &amp; self.<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>Arthur M. Davidson</p>
