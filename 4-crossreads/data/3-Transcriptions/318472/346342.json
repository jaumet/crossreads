<p>27 April 1918<br/>Saturday<br/>Went to Salisbury in the afternoon per motor. A very warm pleasant afternoon. Had a fairly good time in town. Went to a couple of show which were fairly good.</p>
<p>1918 April 28<br/>Sunday<br/>A cold miserable day. Still working in the Canteen. Nothing of particular importance going except that things are still going against us at the Front.</p>
