<p>Friday, 19 February, 1915<br/>Big field day with the Division sham fight between the N.Z Bde and the Aust. attacking a position with Artillery and then with the L.H and Inf.  The 4th Field Ambulance and us were in the rear all the way at permanent dressing stations , eventually the bearers were taken over some sand hills to see the fight, after a lot of mounting and dismounting we returned home about six tired, dirty &amp; hungry.  Our horses had no water from early morning.  We have eaten so much desert sand and dust that we almost spit dust, for this I will not be sorry when we leave Egypt.</p>
<p>Saturday, 20 February, 1915<br/>Cleaned saddlery all the morning inspected by our own officers before stables, I got chipped for having a rusty bit.  Inspection of the hospital and lines by the Brigadier also.</p>
<p>Half holiday as usual stayed home and had a sleep we have a very happy tent party now and every night there is some foolery or horseplay, as soon as my wife and I were in bed another jealous couple tossed us both out of the tent, blankets &amp; all, when we came in again the light was out and there was a great scramble for the blankets, it is always [indecipherable] to go to bed last.</p>
