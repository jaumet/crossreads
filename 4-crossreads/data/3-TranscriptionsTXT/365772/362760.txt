The postal arrangements are very slack.I am nearly alright now Liz. expect to be walking in a week with a stick to help, am very good on crutches I had to come down a flight of stairs to reach this writing room.I     am heartily sick & tired of being here & will be glad to get out again, the trenches are preferable to a Hosp. like this one.Well Lizzie dear I will close now with love to B & R & self From your loving "frere"Ken
