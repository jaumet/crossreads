<p>Sun 2nd June (cont.)<br/>In the afternoon the Cercle Internationale Gymnastique opened its new grounds, which the members have prepared with much sweat.   (I am a member but decline to sweat.)   The Commandant was there with suite &amp; the opening programme included French wresters, Jap. ju-jitsu experts &amp; Lequointe &amp; his squad of half-trained gymnasts in drilling &amp; "pyramids".   Geo. represents our mess in the latter.</p>
<p>Wed. 5th June<br/>A typical day here.</p>
<p>Appel is at 6.15 am. (somewhat prolonged today on account of two fellows escaping last night (it is quite easy to escape here by bribery but one is so far from the borders that it is useless to attempt it).</p>
<p>Immediately after Appel I sally forth to the beach (being "chef of the day") armed with our "bogey" (an old tin converted into a stove), two billies, a packet of "Quaker Oats" and a long business-like ladle.    Practice has enabled us to carry all of these at once.</p>
