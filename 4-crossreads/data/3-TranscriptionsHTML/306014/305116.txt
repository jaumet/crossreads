<p>finale after the service was over.</p>
<p>Strolling round after Church Service we met two nurses from the Salisbury Infirmary who seemed rather lonely, &amp; we spent the next hour with them and caught the bus in time to get back to camp at 11.15. My nurse was rather young &amp; had taken up her work since the outbreak of the war but could not get an appointment to a Base Hospital on account of her limited experience. She was very bright &amp; had lovely pink cheeks, with dimples which showed themselves everytime she smiled, and as her manner suggested a good deal of culture &amp; refinement we exchanged addresses. Of course an Australian in England can always speak to whom he likes, provided he behaves himself, &amp; in this way we need never be at a loss when stranded in a strange city, &amp; one has only to be careful &amp; all is well.</p>
