<p>July 20 Tuesday 1915<br/>Not feeling too well- suffering from Piles a good deal<br/>There are in Alexandra some very large &amp; well stocked shops such as "Steins"Davies, Bryan, but the vast mass of business is transacted in very small, &amp; most insignificant places. Taking an ordinary public street, which is very narrow, you find a connecting link of shops, carrying every conceivable article, that Human Beings require.</p>
<p>July 21 Wednesday 1915<br/>Parade of all patients before a Col Dr. this afternoon He has put me down for further inquiry</p>
<p>July 22 Thursday 1915<br/>Still much the same feeling very weak</p>
<p>One can start with a Barber, &amp; get a general clean up for  5 paistres, Haircut, Shower &amp; brush down; next door you find comfortable quarters to sit, whilst your boots &amp; leggings are cleaned &amp; your laces changed. This costs 1 piastre. The next shop is a refreshment place, where Coffee, Tea &amp; in fact a good round light meal may be had for 2 or 3 piastres. A Tailors shop comes next, then a Laundry, &amp; a baker's shop.  A curio shop. a Tobacconists, together with a  Beer house may be found connected with the rest like a watch chain.</p>
<p>July 23 Friday 1915<br/>Not much changed cannot eat at all well, in fact nothing agrees with me</p>
<p>All postal workers are provided with accomodation &amp; food, as near to the office as possible. The military call tender to provide a certain number of men with food. In Cairo the price per head was 3 piastres per meal per man &amp; the people in Alexandra demand 4 piastres. The meals at Cairo was in every way superior to Alexandra</p>
