<p>22/4/16  Saturday</p>
<p>Reveille at 5. am &ndash; Bagpipes &amp; Band. General swimming parade at 6.15 am, I can say I have a record now that is to say I have swam from Arabia to Egypt. Very hot all day. I can see all the N.C.O.s being cut out of their stripes as I heard they have sufficient N.C.O.s in Camp already for 2 Divisions.</p>
<p>About 10 days ago General Irvine with 3,000 men set out across the Desert from Telekebar to here Ferry's Port &ndash; needless to say he was on Horseback &ndash; enough to say 400 men, marched in here, 21 died &ndash; 1 Lieutenant shot himself &amp; the General is reported under arrest. By the aid of aeroplanes &ndash; the stragglers were located &amp; it is on record that the New Zealanders done good work here in rescuing &amp; suppling water.</p>
<p>About 8.30 am there was a general alarm, anti air Guns were regulated &ndash; Artillery men stood to their posts &ndash; Men grabbed their rifles &amp; awaited further orders, we couldn't see any sign of the hostile ships with the naked eye &amp; nothing eventuated, they say it is of common  occurence</p>
