  
 Sunday 24 Sept. 1916 Foggy early but otherwise a perfect day. A combined Church Parade was held in the morning on the Gas School grounds attended by the whole brigade. The service was taken by Padre McKenzie, General Birdwood, General Walker & their staffs, & Mr. Andrew Fisher being present. At the conclusion ribbons & a few medals were presented by General Birdwood who made a very characteristic speech to his "boys". The 3rd Bn. band was present & it was fine to hear the old hymns played by the band. Most of the remainder of the day I spent letter writing as the Aust. mail closed in the afternoon. A fair-sized home mail in also.
