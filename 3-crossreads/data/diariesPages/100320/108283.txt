7/12/18 Paris
different as all the glass has been removed. Got through into the Law Courts and saw the lawyers walking up and down. By cheek got into the Supreme Court – lovely ceiling and decorations. Now saw where Bolo was tried and then went across to St Severin a very old church dated 600 AD and with fine stained glass windows. Through to the back to St Julien des Pauvres which is also an old place and the chief Greek church in Paris. Now to the Sorbonne and Church of the Sorbonne where we saw Richlieu's tomb with his hat hanging over it and then up to the Pantheon which was closed. Noticed the statue of Le Pensura. Now went to the church of St Genieve (?) where we saw her shrine surrounded by candles – a very pretty little church this. Walked down to Bde Mich
