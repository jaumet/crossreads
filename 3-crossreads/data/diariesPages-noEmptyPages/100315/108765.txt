8/4/18 ? Lavieville
adjacent evacuated villages. In these villages the property of the poor people is everywhere lying about ? furniture, clothes, table and bed linen ? and everything that the people treasure so much at ordinary times. The General was round the line early and called in at Battn. H.Q. for a talk. The 7th Brigade move in and take over on our right tonight. There was an amount of shelling round here this morning and we had some very close at hand. Contrary to his usual custom he is firing salvos and we have an uncomfortable feeling that our own 18 pounder shells are being sent back on to us from our dumps captured by them.
