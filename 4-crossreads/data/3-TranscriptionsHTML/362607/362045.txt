<p>Dear George,<br/>I received your letter &amp; photo of  Deep Creek &amp; Fritz on the Surf Board. I'll answer the letter later on as I've been frightfully busy lately with an epidemic of Influenza. Thank goodness my attack only lasted day with plenty of Quinine &amp; aspirin, I overcame the disability. I sat in the seat next to the one marked X at a Service on the evening &amp; afternoon of the first day I spent in Salisbury about 15 months ago. I've just come from the Theatre. I went to see "Our Miss Gibbs" &amp; it was of course very nice. Ellis had to work late on account of this awful Influenza epidemic. Hundreds &amp; thousands are down with it &amp; especially the Tommies. It attacks people like an epileptic fit &amp; they are down for a week or so with it. We are having bonny sunny weather lately. I went for a long bike ride on Wednesday but I had to take the Bike to pieces since &amp; I still have a puncture to mend &amp; the front Handle bars to replace. I am some bike-mechanic. Well George, Love to you all &amp; especially yourself.  Harry</p>
