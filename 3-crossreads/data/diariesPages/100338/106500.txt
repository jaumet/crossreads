driver returned and started on the journey to the next hospital, He had not moved the car many yards when he became bogged somehow, and was trying for someone to get clear without avail, When judging by the number of voices I heard outside the car, he had managed to get some assistance either from the hospital or passers bye, with their aid he eventually get clear of the difficulty after a delay of about 16 minutes, We then proceeded on our journey at rather a fast rate, judging by the way the ambulance swayed about. On arrival at hospital which was the First Australian General at Sutton Veny, I was taken from the Ambulance & carried to the receiving room, where they took all my particulars and then carried me through about 300 yards of Corridors to the Influenza ward No 16. where I was bathed, put to bed with hot water
