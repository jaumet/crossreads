<p>:Anecdote:</p>
<p>Col Howse told me the following at Anzac, about himself. (October 3rd week. 1915)</p>
<p>A well known Country Medico&nbsp;&amp; distinguished soldier, announced to his wife one evening as soon as the war broke out.</p>
<p>I have just received a wire my dear telling me I am wanted for the war.</p>
<p>When do you set out?</p>
<p>To night. Will you come to Sydney in the Car?</p>
<p>No. But when you reach Sydney see a Mental Specialist (Chisholm Ross.) tell him that you are an old Man with a wife&nbsp;&amp; large family and ask him to confine you as temporarily insane in an hospital.</p>
