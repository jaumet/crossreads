 Saturday 13th July A very quiet day fine &amp; cloudy.  Towards evening had some excitement in the air which I will describe as I saw it. -  The hour is 8.30 P.M. &amp; already night draws near bringing thoughts of bed.  Outside all is quiet save for an occasional gun firing and overhead to right &amp; left are the balloons watching the enemy's lines, to pick out gun flashes in the gathering dusk &amp; so locate their batteries.
