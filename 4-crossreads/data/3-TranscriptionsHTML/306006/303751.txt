<p>26-2-17<br/>Mon 26th<br/>Reveille at 5.30 &amp; if one is slick enough it is possible to get a cup of tea &amp; a wash before the parade at 6.15 had signalling work till 8.30 then dismissed breakfast at 8.45 &amp; parade again at 9.30 till 1 P.M. dinner ten minutes later &amp; parade again at 2.15 till 4 P.M. Anyone wanting leave after the days work is finished must have applications for leave in at 6 A.M. I did not apply this morning as I fancy I am better off without a pass; We had a passing in test this morning at 5 words a minute  &amp; one must get 98% for a pass, a good many failed including  Olson &amp; Pearson</p>
