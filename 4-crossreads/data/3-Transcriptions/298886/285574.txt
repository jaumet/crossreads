<p>were drinking brackish water found by digging pot holes in the sand Strictly against regulations but how can a man survive thirst in this awful desert. That is what kills the men and horses Our water supply was back about 10 miles at OGRATINA. And we had to go back to look for that Aeroplane quite unexpectedly. That was the reason However some of the Brigade went back and dismantled the aeroplane and packed it on camels and brought it back to Railhead. The pilot and the observer had to go back to Camp per boot something like 20 miles through soft sand.</p>
<p>23rd June. Friday..</p>
<p>Came back to OGRATINA and Oh Heavens be praised for some good water we drank and drank and never seemed to be satisfied although the water was hot. Just before Sundown we set off back and after a long and tedious night march again we eventually arrived safely</p>
