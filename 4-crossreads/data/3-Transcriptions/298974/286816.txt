<p>11<br/>I thought that perhaps Niven Cuthbert was buried here, &amp; Tom Bochme &amp; I one day searched every cross marked with an October &amp; November date, but it cant be so. One very pretty grave is marked. "Here lie three unknown German soldiers, and the chest &amp; arm of one marked 135 111 R.R. 2nd Komp. R.I.P." The grave is lined with shrapnel shells &amp; has [indecipherable] on the top. We must credit some Tommies with a bit of decent sentiment here.</p>
<p>I have had no chance to get to Warloy. It is 8 miles away. There is a very large grave-yard there, &amp; it is only time to find dear old Alan's grave. I will spare no effort to locate it if the chance ever offers. It is very dreadful about Jack Curtis, Alan Gordon &amp; Wally Hayes isn't it. Ibis, redibis non, morieris in bello.</p>
