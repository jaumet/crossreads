 [Tuesday 18 July 1916] 
  Letters today from Mother June 4  England. Also English papers-    Mails are delayed a lot now-, but am glad all's well. Enemy plane came again but respects our gunfire &amp; did not drop any bombs. Altho the Weather is hot I have a rotten cold &amp; feel off color, but only a passing cloud no doubt &amp; have been fit for a long time.
