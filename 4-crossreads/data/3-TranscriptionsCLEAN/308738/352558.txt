  
 Nov. 27 Saturday 1915 In Bed all day. Concerts are given regularly here, but so far I cannot get along to them. Gramaphones are taken to different wards & the patients can hear the latest songs free. Photo albums of Australia are also for the use of the Sick who love to look at old familiar spots again. 
 Nov. 28 Sunday 1915 In bed all day. Games of all kinds are for the patients use, & often the Sisters will sit on the bed & play with us. 
 Nov 29 Monday 1915 In bed all day. Regularly each week the Red Cross sends to the patients useful articles such as soap, chocolate, Pipe tobacco etc. My word a man does appreciate the comforts after the hard life.
