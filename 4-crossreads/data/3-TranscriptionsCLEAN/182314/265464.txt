 To 
 Col. Travers. 
 Dear Sir 
 on behalf of the above Association I am instructed to write you, expresssing our sincere Thanks, for the Service you rendered us on Sunday 25 th  Jan. by Adjudicating the Marching Competition held in Connection with our Annual Band Contest. and I would also add that not only our Committee, but all the Competing Bands were well satisfied with the decisions you gave, and there was not one word of dissatisfaction heard from any Band. This of course had a lot to do with making this competition a success. & as this was the first Marching Competition we have held; we were Naturally Anxious. But as you undertook this responsible job for us, & carried it out, so well, everyone being well [pleased?]  I wish to convey to you the Heartiest thanks of all the Committee. 
 Yours Truly, 
 E.R. Eyles.
