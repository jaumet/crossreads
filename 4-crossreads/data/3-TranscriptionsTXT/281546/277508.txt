 decided in the first round. Each Contest was for 3 rounds of 2 minutes with a spell of 1 minute. The 3rd Contest was as Exhibition of Sparring and it was very laughable, the antics of the two were very amusing. At 5.30Pm the Contests came to a finish and all hands came away. At 7.30 the Aeros Concert Party was billed to give a performance in the Cinema, and in the meantime our Boys passed the time in kicking the Ball others promenaded about the Grounds, myself going over to the Canteen and then had a walk around the Camp. This Camp is well laid out. A Football Ground in the centre with a Main Road on one side with Officers Quarters and stores and then a large number of Nessian Huts around the other two sides. The W.R.A.F Girls are billeted in Nessian Huts on the opposite side to the Officers Quarters and is wired off, one can easly pick out the Girl's Huts with the small coloured curtains hanging inside of the Windows.
