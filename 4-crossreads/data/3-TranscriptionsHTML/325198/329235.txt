<p>6 February, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>On Inlying pickquet to night &amp; have made my bed up near the feed heaps.  We have to sleep up about the meal room &amp; its not a good place as the boys are making a beastly row playing two &ndash; up, such a noise.  Dont give one much chance to sleep. This morning Mr Ryrie got all the old boys in the troop to get their photos taken &ndash; I hope they turn out alright. It rained all last night but it is nice &amp; bright to night.</p>
