  
 mind I met some Australian people who took me home and made me stay the night. Next day I went back to the hotel & brought all my gear down  and  as I was kindly asked to stay there during my leave. Pleased at finding somebody sympathetic and someone who understood Australians I readily agreed. The people I am with are a splendid type of  t  Australian. Very hospitable & kind to anyone in a fix. The daughter whose fiancee is in France  takes  has volunteered to take me all round and see the sights. I have had a look inside the National Art Gallery & the pictures are indeed fine.
