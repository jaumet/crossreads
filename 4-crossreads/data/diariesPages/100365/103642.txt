before long as the farm people tell us that it is pretty well a daily occurrence.Today we received a few letters which we did not get when at Serapeum in Egypt. I got 4 dated 16/4/16 (one marked from Nina) so I suppose there are a lot for me somewhere about France as I have not had any for many weeks.An Observation Balloon has just ascended there is a fight on between our Aeroplanes defending it the Germans. There seems to be an unusual heavy bombardment going on.A big thunderstorm has just commenced it is raining in torrents the first I have seen since December last. Fancy 6 months without seeing rain, but I have said before that Egypt is a very hot dry country.
