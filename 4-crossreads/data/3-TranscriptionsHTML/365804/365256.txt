<p>Dear Mrs.Richards<br/>I regret exceedingly to be compelled to break to you the news of your dear son's death. Captain Richards during the days he passed at this station became a great friend of many of the officers and tho' not of my religion &ndash; I am a Roman Catholic Chaplain &ndash; he took a fancy to me and often wished to chat with me. I cannot tell you much his death was felt by all who knew him. But of course it must be a very grave trial to you. You have, however, the consolation of knowing that your son did his duty in this awful war, with unflinching courage; all his officers are loud in his praise. Well then, his wound were so bad that had he lived his life would have been a misery to him. He had to have both legs amputated. I know these considerations are insufficient to lighten the load of your grief. I think God will help you courageously to bear up under this heavy burden</p>
<p>Everything that medical skill and scientific nursing could suggest was done to save your son. And I must say the poor patient was most appreciative of every little kindness we endeavoured to show him.</p>
<p>Accept then my most sincere sympathy and believe me,<br/>Yours faithfully<br/>(Sgd) E.J.Cullen. C.F.<br/>R.C. Chaplain<br/>No. 3 C.C.S.<br/>B.E.F.</p>
