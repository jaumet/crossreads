<p>not know as there was a large entry for the race &amp; it was a very severe race &amp; the times were good.  It proved a disappointment but it was no good kicking about it.  The brigade concert at night was a first class one &amp; was a fitting end to a good day.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26th April<br/>Very hot day, quite our hottest.  The night did not bring its usual cool change &amp; it turned out to be the hottest night I have yet experienced.  Had a very quite day.</p>
<p>Thursday 27th April<br/>General drill out on the desert, the officers brushing up their drill at our expense.  Inspection of camp during afternoon.  On guard for 24 hours commencing at 6 P.M.  My first shift 10 P.M till 2 A.M. &amp; two prisoners to watch, strafe the beggars, I won't be sorry when they are sentenced &amp; sent off.</p>
<p>Friday 28th April<br/>Still on guard &amp; feeling very tired as the weather is hot one of the worst guards I have yet done.  More mail in &amp; a letter from France, Will D. giving me our first authentic news of my late unit being in France.</p>
