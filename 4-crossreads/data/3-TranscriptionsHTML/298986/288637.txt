<p>the woodwork just over my head keeps creeking.  A good many sick.  Warmer to day some rain.  Passed C. St. Vincent about 10 A.M.  Lights on the coast in sight at bed time.</p>
<p>Wednesday 26th</p>
<p>The day perfect went through the Straights of Gibralta last night &amp; are now in the sparkling Mediteranean.  Warm bright &amp; calm.  <strike>Can</strike> Could see the mountains in Spain clearly in morning.  Enjoyed the warmth &amp; read most of the day.</p>
