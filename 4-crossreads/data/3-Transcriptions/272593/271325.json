<p>this evening &amp; they were badly needed for we are all "crummy".<br/>2 of my men have "buzzed off &amp; have not been sighted for 24 hours<br/>I expect they are drunk in Albert or else in the clink.<br/>Billetting NCO's are going away from here tonight, so that means a move in the morning.<br/>What do you think, our Major refused to let us run our Sergts Mess the other day, rotten I reckon   &amp; only for us shifting there would have been a fine row for the Committee were going to go further with it to Bde if necessary for we are entitled to  "Mess" &amp; unless he has a very fine excuse he will get into hot water &amp; serve him right, he knew nothing whatever about our moving so there is no excuse</p>
