<p>6 SATURDAY</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot. Cleaning harness</p>
<p>ect all morning &amp; we had</p>
<p>a football match in evening</p>
<p>just a scratch game. There was</p>
<p>no parade in afternoon</p>
<p>till stables was called.</p>
<p>I got a letter from mother</p>
<p>&amp; some tobacco from the</p>
<p>Civil Service. I did one</p>
<p>shift of Bill Constable&#39;s picket</p>
<p>at night.</p>
