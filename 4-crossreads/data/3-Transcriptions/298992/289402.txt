<p>Had to leave by the 12 noon train on Christmas Day, as I was due at a Dinner at Shoubra Hospital at 6.30 sounds alright, doesn't it? &ndash; and it was<br/> alright, as you can see by the enclosed Menu. Lance Corporal Smith of our Company has a sister nursing out at the Hospital, and I have been out several times with him. When it was decided to have a Dinner on Xmas night, each nurse was allowed to invite a friend. Of course Sister Smith invited her brother, so I suppose you wonder how I got there? Well I met a number of nurses during my visits there, and one of them asked me so nicely if I would come on Xmas Day, that really I didn't have the heart to refuse.</p>
