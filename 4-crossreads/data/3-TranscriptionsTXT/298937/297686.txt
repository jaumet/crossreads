Tales of GallipoliThe 3rd F.A. at the Landing
At LemnosThe 3rd Field Amb. had been practising with the infantry, landing from a line on to the shore, & generally training, for some weeks & at last the time had come.Previously they had been under the impression that they were destined for France, but they soon found that the Turks were their objective.The fatal day arrived & in its first hour they seem to have left Lemnos for that now historic stretch of country round Anzac, north of Gaba Tepe.
