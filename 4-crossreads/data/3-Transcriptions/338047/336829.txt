The strike trouble with the Battalions had not been settled, so it was decided to send the Battalions into the line as they were. The officers returned to their units and all was well &ndash; till after the stunt. Bill Collins went out with the nucleus. I think if I had pressed the point that I might have been able to avoid the stunt on account of the boils, but I was anxious to see the Hindenburg line that I had heard so much about. As it was the MOP gave me permission to have my pack carried in a limber, as I could not bear any weight on my back. We started off about 5.30pm</p>
