Upolu again I can tell you  -
Harrison - our wireless man - gives us news whenever he can  -  A ship is much safer at sea with wireless  -  Knock your propeller off - catch fire - out go distress signals & people know where you are & off they go  -  We learn that a German cruiser has been hobbled up at Mafia island & that island is German E. Africa  -  The usual ebb & flow of babble in N France has ceased to interest  -  We want a definite issue badly  -
Nat history stirred my sluggish brain one day when I saw a tropic or 'bosun' bird - Phaethon tropicus? He or she is about the size - perhaps larger - of a silver gull  -  They have a raucous gull like note  -  They are white & you spot them by the long tail streamer - 12 -18 inches of feather  -
