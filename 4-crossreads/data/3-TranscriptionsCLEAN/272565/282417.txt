  
 we felt run down after carrying continuously for 24 hours through shell fire.  Heavy shells landed round us every time we were out.  Once the duckboards were blown up in front of us, but many a shell burst in waterholes close by and splashed us from head to foot.  From 5 a.m. until relieved at 2 p.m. we hadn't a carry - Lucky for us, as the shelling was heavy.  Returned to No. 4 post, had tea & got into bed.
