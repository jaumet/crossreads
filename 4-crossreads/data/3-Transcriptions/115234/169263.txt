<p>When machine guns</p>
<p>were busily clacking</p>
<p>And bullets buzzed</p>
<p>round like Bees</p>
<p>Who always did the</p>
<p>attacking</p>
<p>Us blokes who came</p>
<p>overseas</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When our mothers</p>
<p>hearts were yearning</p>
<p>Sorrows Cup was</p>
<p>drained to the Lees</p>
<p>While glory &amp; fame we</p>
<p>were earning</p>
<p>Us blokes who came</p>
<p>overseas</p>
