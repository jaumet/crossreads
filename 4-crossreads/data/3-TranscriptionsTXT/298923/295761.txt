5 April 1918 FridayCarmelite Monastery.  Warmer & fine night made hideous by Pariah dogs which follow our meat rations even into Buildings.  I followed one in my shirt tails & fired my revolver.This afternoon made my adress to the different Monks, & Fathers of the monasteries, & told them theirs was true Christianity when they took us out of the wet & mud-  Am told quite hot at Jericho now only 15 miles away & malaria starts there in a couple of months.Enclose snapshots of Bon Fete, one Father indignant because only took 1/2  his face.
