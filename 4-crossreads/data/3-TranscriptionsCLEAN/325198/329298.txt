7 May, 1916KatiaWe left camp to day at 1.30 too feed [indecipherable] horse & man, gosh it was hot too.  We camped at Katia & every one started to boil quarts for tea after watering horses.  I had just taken one sip of boiling hot tea when we got the order to saddle up, so there was a cramming of bully  beef & bread & a gulping of hot tea for 30 sec & we shoved on the old saddles & off once more,  We had to go on out post until the two regiments were ready to move off  The sand flies nearly ate me & my horse
