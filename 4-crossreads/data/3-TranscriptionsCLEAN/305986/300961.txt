"The Comparison"
The Knights of old went to the fightArrayed in shining armourReflecting back the sunshine brightAnd smiled on by fair charmerWho sent her hero on to dareSome deed of knightly dutyIn open Air and forest fairAll clothed in Verdant beauty
No shining armour can arrayThe warriors of "Wipers"Unless they want to fall a preyTo lurking German SnipersNo glittering steel from head to heelBut Flanders mud attires themLike Mice and Moles they darkly stealWhatever war requires them.
