The river Lys runs through the town and when in flood inundates the surrounding country. It has been straightened out into a canal. After dark with Lieut Anderson the 101st Bde transport officer I am going up to the trenches and round the dumps. At night things are said to liven up with flares c. They speak feelingly of the rough time during the winter here and I can quite understand it. Judging by the look of the ground. The roofing of the houses here is mostly red Marseilles tiles and often inlet in glazed tiles they have a cross or date 1837.
For more attic accommodation and snow fall the roofs are often shaped bludging slightly at the bottom. Most of the decent people have cleared out and those left are pretty tough. At the billet of the transport a number of children are those of the unmarried daughters by British soldiers and there are few virgins in this part of France. However the behaviour of the troops is excellent and our men at LIGNE are excellently well conducted and the change among healthy clean decent women and clean homes has done them good. 
We carry gas helmets everywhere here and placards in the streets inform the inhabitants of protective measures. In the shops the chief sign appears to be "Beer". The Royal Scots wear Tam o Shanters and seem a good smart body of chaps taking them all round. In my billet here are crucifix sacred pictures and framed certificates of first communion and membership of some society of the church. An old oil painting is also upon the wall. The bed is a wooden one, wash basin ewer rest upon a small table and a small cabinet and a desk complete the furniture.
