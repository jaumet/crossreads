<p>Have you seen Mrs or Mary O'Connor lately?  Give them my love should you do so.</p>
<p>9 p.m.  Two papers "Table Talk" of 18.2.15 and "Sydney Mail" 17.2-15 arrived during the afternoon, they were sent by Mrs M. M. Knowles of Melbourne.  Most of the pictures in the former we[re] topical events current in Melbourne, while the war was the subject for most in the latter.</p>
<p>Still are we stuck up here, some prearranged plan has grossly miscarried, and thrown out of joint the plans as determined upon by those responsible on our side of the great struggle.  Whether 'twill be possible to compensate for it, will be evolved in the future.  Meanwhile the Australian Division, here, destined some weeks ago to be moving onward is held firmly to the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>Rumour in office this day that bags of mails containing Australian letters have arrived in the Camp.  Hope so and that midst them are some for me.</p>
<p>I enclose you a picture which I hope that you will like.  It was taken on Saturday afternoon last, when a sports meeting of the 2nd Bttln. was being held.  You will see Jerrom in the back ground between Colonel Brand and me.  The three soldiers to the left are officers of the 2nd Bttln.  The building to the right and back is on the edge of Mena village, inhabitants 3000.</p>
<p>24-3-15. 3 a.m.  Since midnight I have been adding some sheets to material I have been building up for Dr Armitt [Armit].  I do not know if the sentences are worth publishing.  If he does not think them so I am asking him to send them on to you, as in leisure moments they may give you or your friends some pleasure.</p>
<p>"How poor are they that have not patience!<br/>What wound did ever heal but by degrees?"</p>
<p>Good night!  Good night!!!  Good night!!!!<br/>[Lines of Xs and Os.]</p>
<p>[Dr Henry William Armit (1870-1930), founding editor of the Medical Journal of Australia (1914).]</p>
