<p>No cover for man or beast, one sheet of water,  The frame work of a hut was here. I lent the men a tarpaulin that I carried for a shop, to put over, so they were right for the night.  Sgt Bootle an I brought a portable Armstrong hut along on G S wagon.  Fixed it up in the pouring rain, Anyhow we had a dry place to sleep in that night</p>
