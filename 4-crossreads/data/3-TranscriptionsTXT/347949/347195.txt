 26th March 1918 Fritz shelling very heavily. The people had only left the village that day &amp; we saw the last of them go. Meals were left on the tables &amp; on the fire. Dig in and  that night  up to  Deinacourt. Here we stayed a day or so. I forget the exact time in reserves. Then we went up to the front line and were in an outpost for 24 hours.
