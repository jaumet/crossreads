We eventually arrived at our destination a Place called Thiennes & we went to our first Billets to a small village called Boesemghem where we stayed about 10 days & had a good time as a Bottle of good champagne only cost five francs about 3/7 English, while we were there we got our kit bags & after taking out what we wanted, the bags were sent to England & that was the last some of us ever saw of them.
At last we were told we were going up towards the front & we set out one day for our long march up to the Armentieres sector,  We marched past General Joffre on the road into Harzebrouk, which town the German Cavalry had invaded until driven out by the English Troops this place was under long distance shell fire as you could see where the shells had hit the place.  We went into Billets at Jesus farm where we stopped a few days & again moved up to billets at Casteen Farm, where we relieved the Tyneside Irish in some wooden Huts infested with rats.
we waited there until our turn came to go into the front line of trenches at Bois Greniere on the right of Armentieres  we relieved the 17th Batt. A.I.F. as the ground about there is low lying Trenches could not be dug, so sand bag trenches we built up & named after London streets & places such as London Bridge Oxford Circus Park Avenue Shaftsbury avenue Jock's Joy Tramway avenue.
The place was fairly quiet when we first went there & as we did not loose many men still we were always under & on some days heavy shell fire from the Huns 5'.9 Guns, we took turn about the 17th & us of the 19th from April until June when we were moved up to Ypres where we went in twice each time in the Trenches for about 10 days each time, but before going to Ypres were in Billets in a Convent at Poferinge & from there we got on a Train all in darkness & went up as far as the railway was safe to travel on to
