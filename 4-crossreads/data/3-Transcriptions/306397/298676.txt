<p>18 Nov 1914<br/>The Secretary for the governour of the Strait has published the information that about 120 of the "Emden" crew are saved. Where they are, nobody knows.</p>
<p>19 Nov.1914<br/>The papers bring on the whole nothing new. The germans are of course beaten back all along. Many of the reports are that stupid that they make one laugh. Of the whereabout of the "Emden" or rather her crew nothing has so far been reported. The whole business about the "Emden" seem a bit dark to me.</p>
<p>20 Nov.1914<br/>Todays paper brings an extract from the "Times' according to which, we (Germany) are doing well and the main feature of which is the fear of an invasion of England. In the sea battle on the Chile coast the English cruisers "Good Hope" &amp; "Monmouth" were sunk by our squadron</p>

<p>22 Nov 1914<br/>Our commander and the Prince of Hohenzollern are PoW in Hong Kong. In the evening performance of the "Hamburger &ndash; Jungs" (Hamberg Boys) in the theatre.</p>
<p>23rd Nov 1914<br/>The "Hamburger Jungs" had great appearance. It is indeed very admirable considering the spare means at our disposal that so much could be done. It finished up with a moving picture, after which the "Wacht am Rhein" was sung.</p>
