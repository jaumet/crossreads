<p>Sat. Mar. 24.  Jack Kitson resigned from "the Nightbirds".</p>
<p>Sun. Mar. 25.  Final rehearsal.  Things going good.  Fritz still going back.  I wish he would go right back to Germany so that we could get back Home.</p>
<p>Mon. Mar. 26.  Major McKenzie discharged about 50 Patients yesterday, but we are nearly full up again.  The Concert came off &amp; was pretty good, but not  so good as the show we put on in Albert &amp; Meault.  Norm Adams made us some new ruffles which looked very well indeed.  Nick Coxon appeared as  Melba &amp; did very well.  Heard today that the Bapaume Town Hall had blown up &amp; caught some of the Comforts Fund people who were arranging for a Concert  to be held there. [A mine laid by the retreating Germans]</p>
