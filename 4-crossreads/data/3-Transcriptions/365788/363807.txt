<p>1st Field Ambulance<br/>Mudros West<br/>Lemnos. Is.<br/>9 Oct 15<br/>My dearest Sister,<br/>It seems so very uncertain what our future movements will be that I will cancel the suggestion which I made in a previous letter to you about sending my letters to 2nd Stationary Hospital. Please send them till further notice to No. 2 General Hospital as before &amp; they will forward them. Please ring up Trix &amp; Neil Sherwin &amp; tell them &ndash; Absolutely no news &ndash; but will write now &amp; then to let you know I am well.<br/> Much love to you all,<br/>Your loving brother,<br/>Fred</p>
