you could get scarcely anything if you were one of the lucky ones to snap anything you had to pay outrageous prices for them.
I forgot to mention we also had canned peaches as much tea as we liked, so you can see we are not living too bad we very often have the same amount everyone lives fairly well over here for unlike the poor "Tommies" we are paid pretty well most of the money goes into food.
We had 2 men killed 4 wounded last night, 2 of them were wounded by the premature explosion of one of our own "rifle grenades" which burst just as it was leaving the riffle
