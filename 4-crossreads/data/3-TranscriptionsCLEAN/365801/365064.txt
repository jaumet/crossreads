 Dear Judge Ferguson It is with very great grief in my heart that I am writing to you now.  The shock of hearing of Arthur's death and of seeing the place where it occurred are still too fresh in my mind.  I came along to the trench very soon [after] it had happened.  He must have died instantly. At the very best this can only be a most insufficient method of expressing the sympathy I feel, the sympathy that it is my privilege to feel.  To me the whole thing has come as an awful shock.  I can not quite realise yet what has happened and that I have lost one of the best friends it was ever my good fortune to have.  One can but dimly realise what this will mean to you and Mrs Ferguson
