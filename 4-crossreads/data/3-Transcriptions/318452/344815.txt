On Saturday afternoon McCook &amp; I went to Wilton where his wife is staying I borrowed a bike but it punctured after I had gone about a mile &amp; I had to mend it.<br/>On Sunday I took two services one at 9.30 &amp; the other at 10.30<br/>Last night it began to snow and continued all night so that the ground was covered to a depth of 7 inches this morning It was a very fine sight<br/>I have not been out today a thaw has commenced and everything is terribly sloppy</p>
