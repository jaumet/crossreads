 Dear Mr. Layton &ndash; We are sending Mrs. Lehair who has had some assistance from you before. 
 She has one debt &pound;3-15-0 to the Bon Marche which she seems unable to meet otherwise she can get on alright on the military pay. 
 She has three young children &amp; is paying 12/- per week for rent of room &ndash; 
 Perhaps you may be able to help &ndash; 
 Yours truly B. Booth.
