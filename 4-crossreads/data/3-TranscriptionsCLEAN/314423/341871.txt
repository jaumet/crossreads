  
 Tuesday Jan 29. 1918, 1275. A beautiful day. Bill Keiley returned early this morning. He was delayed by the boat coming from Ireland. Holmes is away on leave and Mathews is sick so I had to go on shoeing this morning. I shod two horses before dinner and one in the afternoon. Some of the attached men were sent back to their companies in the trenches tonight and as one of them was on picquet duty to night I was put on in his place - second picquet from 9 40 to 12.15. Tonight Matthews was sent to the Hospital suffering from Influenza. Wednesday Jan 30. 1918. 1276 There was a very heavy frost last night, but today the weather is beautiful. I was again shoeing today. To night I wrote to my wife. [Shorthand Symbol] 112. I also wrote to my Uncle J. Gilmore. Thursday Jan 31. 1918, 1277 There was another heavy frost last night and it was cold & cloudy all day. I was again shoeing to day. No papers came to hand today. The papers we got yesterday reported another air raid on S.E. England. Friday Feb. 1. 1918. 1278 Cold & frosty last night
