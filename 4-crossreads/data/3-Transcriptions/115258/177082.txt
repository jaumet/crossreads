<p>here named McQuiggen from Rylstone, His cousin was in the 1st Regt was killed in Romani. Meadows is a great Corriedale enthusiast, but &nbsp;has never seen many of the sheep. He would like to come over to home some day and see all the flock sheep as well as the studs he <s>has</s> says. His Father has 1st cross Lesters and gets the same price as we do for his wool, but the trouble is they cant keep their wool even, with the comeback lams etc. You never actually said you got the power of attorney I sent you, but as you say it is now registered, I suppose it is all right. I hope it goes through OK; that Warrobil paddock should make first rate little stud paddocks I think. I&#39;m glad you saw Jim Leask. I knew you&#39;d like him - and I hope he does go up home. It has been pretty cold and windy here the last day or two and has been snowing up Beyrout way I hear. People in Australia have never seemed to realize that we get winter here yet. Anyhow I&#39;m glad I&#39;m missing some of it down here. No news here yet of any demobilization scheme, but there is a boat in <s>take</s> taking a load of Australians wives out to Aussie, which is causing a good bit of fun here. Love to Mother and Hal &amp; Fred</p>
<p>Your loving son</p>
