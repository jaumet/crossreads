 27/3/18 ? La Bass Vill night a stray minnenwerf came over on to No. 7 post and kill Parson . Blew one leg right off and also the other foot . Decor with M.M. Croix de Guerr this good lad was one of the best and a good cool young subaltern is gone . Slept until mid-day . About 2 p.m. walk across to Jame ? H.Q . and had a yarn with him . Sellick tick off the British Line down South in accord with the latest messag . Hun now hold a line about where it was when we hop off in Juli 1916 . The which is rotten for our moral .
