<p>her boys have sprung many surprises upon her. Tickets for you and for me should have come from the Agricultural Show people, if I be not back next year &amp; write for them &amp; say that I directed you to do so.</p>
<p>Clarrie Bridge had a rare voyage round the world, I wrote to him some time ago.   I wrote to Mr. Bennet formerly of the Orsova, but the letter was returned from the Admiralty "Not Known".  Good to ring "Our Buddie" up on Easter Sunday. My best wishes to Nellie Commerford.  I have wondered how Mr Potts is.   When writing to Jack MacNamara I desired him to convey my best wishes to his Principal. I must write direct before long.</p>
<p>The Editor of the A.M.G. has not sent me copies of the journal. Very thoughtless of him. I have written several articles for the paper.  Dr. Peck sent to me a copy of the London Times with information about the speech of Revd. Dr. Littleton.  A schoolmaster is always "A man amongst boys and a boy amongst men".  The Archbishop is making money out of his Manly land.  It is fit to sell it.  Intact it was a splendid estate worthy of the palace &amp; the College.   A very mercenery spirit to sell it.  I am in first class fettle now, eating, sleeping, &amp; able for any amount of work. The rain was making up for an absence.</p>
<p>Joey dear:/ Your letter next as it too had an envelope to itself. As of Kitty's so of yours, the most interesting and satisfying of all the ones you have written to me.  Glad that you liked the article in the Medical Gazette.  The men always work well for me, because I am sympathetic with them, keep an eye upon them, &amp;</p>
