Sunday13-12-14  A hot stuffy Saty night & the Fantome rolled, rolled, rolled - Clean white suits all round today & the Captain goes the Rounds & anyone who isnt up to the mark gets 'Scrubbed'. All went well & then we had prayers & then 'Fall out' - I've informed my SBA that when I say 8.30 for Sick Parade - I mean it - The blighter got my tongue sorely this morning for being late - I dont want any excuses - I want punctuality - I read Spectators & played Bridge till lunch & now I'm writing my journal - No press news - not a vessel seen - We are about? 100 miles off Wrossel Island - S of N. Guinea - We expect to be in Rabaul on W-day by noon -
Monday11-12-14  Mab is 20 - Dear girl - I'm very fond of her - We must all have a stunt together somewhere when I come back - I like this life but I also like home life - What's the news? - Nothing doing - We're somewhere close up to Wrossel  Island - We're a week out - All goes well - The Fantome in every way is far before the Upolu - Ship is far superior - Discipline is A1 - No gooning - All goes as smooth as oil - Sick parade was sharp on 8.30 this morning - By Jove we rolled last eveg. We took both Port & Sherry Decanters at dinner & one terrific roll took nearly half the things off our table - No fresh meat, no decent
