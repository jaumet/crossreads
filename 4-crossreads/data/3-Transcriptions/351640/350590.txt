<p>Sacred Bulls was our next objective.  We went down a passage, to a gate in the sands, which opened into a large tunnel, a short distance along a downward incline it was obstructed by one of the Sarcophagi, which were told Mariette had essayed to bring to the surface that it might be placed at the museum in Cairo, he ceased his endeavour before daylight was reached, now the hugh [huge] granite block and its lid lie blocking the way.  On the right and left of the main passage are chambers each of which contains a sarcophagus, no two chambers face one another.<br/>"Some of the monolithic (cut out of a single stone) sarcophagi, 24 in all are in Synite [syenite &ndash; similar to granite], some in bassalt, and others in limestone.  They are from 10 ft. to 14 ft. in height.  Their length varies between 14 ft &amp; 18 ft., with proportional width.

<p>How did the people of that period do it?  It is said that the land part of the moving was effected by round logs placed beneath on which the blocks were rolled onwards.  How were they got into the chamber?  Supposedly somewhat in the same way.  Several of the sarcophagi are adorned with lines and figures of all kinds.  You might see a drawing of the Serapeum and the Sarcophagi in one of the encyclopedias at home.  Of all that I</p>
