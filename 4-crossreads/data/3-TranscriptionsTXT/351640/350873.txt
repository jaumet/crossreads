 Hurrah. Hurrah. Hurrah.  A whole heap of letters from you and others.   Your letters bear date, from the 26th of January to the 24th of April.  That of the earlier date has been delayed in Sydney as far as I can judge. 
 Tabbie dear: You were good to write to me so much information.  Please do not worry so much about the money matters, you and Joe put your heads together, you will find that all will work out well and there will be sufficient to meet your needs, if not when I return I shall straighten matters out for you.  Please have a talk with Mr. Finney about anything that you do not fully understand, it is part of his business to know about business matters and he will help you all that he can.  Please do not fear to talk with him? 
 The parade through the streets must have been a great sight.   I can just imagine the crowd on the balcony.  Some day I hope to be there again if not why fortune will have frowned severely against me, yet do I hope for the best.   How kind of Mr Bridge to remember me.   A very nice letter came from him today, he still thinks you to be of the best.  I am very much obliged to him for taking such a fatherly interest in you girls.  He will have a note from me before long.  Meanwhile will you please convey to him to Mrs. Bridge and the family my best wishes.  Glad that you entertained them all hospitably.  I shall be very sad and come straight home when relieved from duty if I feel that you are stinting your selves unnecessarily, some times the idea gets into my mind that you are doing so.   Please do not do so? 
 I hope that the chance will come to me to see Maggie Phipps and the members of her family.  In these days no one can tell what will happen during the next few weeks.   The two girls will miss Maggie very much, she has been quite a mother to them just when they wanted one badly.  I admire her for it.  I am glad that you asked them to stay with you for a little.  We may not be rich but we can be kind to those of our acquaintance, and I have known them all their lives, also their mother their father and their grandparents. 
 This afternoon I bought a copy of L'illustration? it will go forward to you, because it has as supplement a first class picture of General Joffer, [Joffe] and also other pictures of merit.  It is of the best type of French illustrated papers.   As far as my observation has gone the maps in the illustrated journals are mor[e] clear in depicting the battle fields than are the daily or weekly journals, because the paper used is of better quality.   Think you this observation to be correct?
