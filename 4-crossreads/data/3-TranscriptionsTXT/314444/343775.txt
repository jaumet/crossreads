about the war, but you'll be normal again by the time this reaches you. There is only one to win this game of horror, and we have no doubt as to who the victor will be, no matter how long it takes us to gain that result. Don't let cable news dishearten you. So glad to know the seasons were good and to read of bright days your way.
I received a number of parcels while I was in the convalescent camp. Glad you received the "physog" taken in Paris and letters of such late date.
Postal arrangements are apparently improving, because even parcels arrive eight weeks after posting. I shall scribble a letter to Joan Quinan. Received her letter and Beattie's, tooX X X
