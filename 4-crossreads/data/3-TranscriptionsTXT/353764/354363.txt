We arrived at "Zestoon" at 2.45 am in the morning & marched out to Heliopolis Camp.  There are 500,000 Troops hereabouts.The Australian Forces have been withdrawn from Anzac & are now at (Ismalia) 40 miles out.They are in contact with the Turks & there area tremendous lot of casualties.We camped on the ground for the balance of the morning & then started a hard mornings work.
