<p>2nd Jan. Sunday<br/>After Church, I sleep the morning out &amp;  go for a run out to the Zoo in the afternoon. Keep very quiet in anticipation of duty to-morrow. The Zoo here is one of the finest &amp; largest in the world, amongst other things on view are the two bullet riddled boats in which the Turks tried to cross the Canal    &amp;  a few kangaroos donated by our boys.</p>
