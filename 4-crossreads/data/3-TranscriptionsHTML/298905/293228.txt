<p>was expecting something to happen<br/>Just as one of our patrols were going out from the sally port" last night they spotted a mob of Germans waiting for them outside our barb wire, so they had to come back &amp; get some rifles &amp; bombs but when they went out the second time they were gone.<br/>I was very near shot myself last night a sniper was about 30 yards in front of our trench, &amp; I was peering about looking for a shot at him, when he shot at me twice but missed me by a hairsbreadth each time I'm hanged if we could see him although we knew where he was so we concentrated our fire on to the spot &amp; that shut him up, you haven't much chance of seeing them for "no mans land" is full of oats &amp; grass about 4ft high, &amp; trees, shell holes &amp;</p>
