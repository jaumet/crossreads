 Rostron &amp; I made two futile attempts to go to the museum but failed each time because we drove and I only succeeded by walking there. You see the principal place in Alexandria is the square and when ever a nigger driver cant understand where you want to go he just takes you straight to the square. Well Rostron &amp; I took a garry here and asked the driver if he knew where the museum was; he said yes and off we went to land a little later at the square; we got an interpreter there but he did not seem to understand much; however we went off again and this time arrived at Pompey's Pillar; which finished us for one day. Next day we took a tram which we knew went some where near it; the guard knew all about it and was going to tell us where to get out but took us right out to Nouzha; so we caught a tram back and another guard knew all about it and kept telling us it was a bit further on till we got right back to the Square, so that finished us again.  The third time I walked and just trusted to luck and got there with out any trouble. I often spend my afternoons now on sea wall talking to the kids and it is wonderful the information you can get from them.  The camera &amp; a few cigarretts 'backseesh" will bring dozens of them round.  Expect to leave here in a couple of days. Your loving nephew Rob.
