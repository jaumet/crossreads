the Camp is seething with discontent only wants a little match to start the mob going, they can't do what they like with the Australians, all the men swear they are not going to go on parade I only hope they stick to it. Had a very small Dental List last night I soon finished, then Lindsay I went for a walk down to Sutton Veney, it is lovely over here of an evening strolling down the leafy flower strewn roads lanes. Our usual medical inspection classification was held today, I went up before old Von Hagen as one of the examing Drs here is commonly called he marked me the same as before B.I.A.2 he gave me a haul over with his instruments I am getting much stronger now am beginning to feel very fit, only I am very weak sweat freely.
