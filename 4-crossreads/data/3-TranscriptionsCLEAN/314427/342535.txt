Thursday April 10.1919   151[Shorthand transcribed as follows]. 10 day of the voyage.  [end of shorthand] This morning is again hot. It is very close and stuffey between decks. I could not sleep last night for coughing, so paraded sick & the M.O. recommended me to sleep on deck.
The ships course was altered this morning to about 8 degrees East of South. I saw several schools of Porpoises, numerous sharks and flying fish. The Southern Cross can now be plainly seen. It is a very pleasant sight to the home coming Aussies. It can be seen about 600 miles N. of the Equator.
Today has been very hot, and it is also hot tonight. Fortunately there is a cool breeze, but  between decks it is like an oven.
There was another concert tonight, also a boxing match.  There are several whist and Euchere Tournaments on board also draughts and chess!  In the draughts I won two semi finals, but lost the one for this deck which means I will not be in the final.
Friday April 11.1919.   (152)The heat is very intense. It was hot all night
