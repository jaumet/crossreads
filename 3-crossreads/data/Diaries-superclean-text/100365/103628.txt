The French Girls seem to be very nice" but I have not seen any closelyOne can see the self same customs here as were in evidence at Cairo showing how they copied the French people in their habits.The old Forts at the top of the cliffs look very romantic spell of Napoleons time.The Railway winds in out of the cliffs I am looking forward to a trip on a train.There seems to be a big tram service.The City itself I understand is very cosmopolitan on account of it being a Sea port Town.These are the wharf glimpses. The actual Town itself I will see later.

I obtained leave last night in company with a couple of others went into the City of Marseilles.I had heard a lot about the place previously, but it opened my eyes properly. It is a big city well laid out many magnificent Buildings in it principal among them being Cathedrals
