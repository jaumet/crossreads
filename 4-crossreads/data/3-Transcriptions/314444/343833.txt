<p>My brigade did not land some guns of the 2nd and first batteries went ashore but were sent back. A fleet of Transport made some feint landing at the head of the Gulf of Xeros we all embarked in ships boats to draw the fire from the forts that were previously destroyed by the navy. At one place we did draw fire, some of the shell were very close, the destroyers who were towing the boats got out of range as quickly as possible then the navy steped in but it only lasted for half an hour just a little afternoons sport. We returned <strike>back</strike> to Kaba Tepe and from there ordered to Cape Helles where <strike>our</strike> the first brigade was landed and has been in action ever since. The Amn. Column after some days cruising about between Kaba Tepe and Cape Helles</p>
