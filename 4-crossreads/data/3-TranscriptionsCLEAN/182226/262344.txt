  
 Thursday 18 November, 1915 
 Had to come back to camp for medical injection. Was put in "C" Section. Went straight into Valletta after that. Went to Pieta at 2.30. Took the girls photo dressed in our clothes. We put on their skirts meanwhile. 
 We stayed till 10.30. I had to take "Mem" into Valletta as she was disappointed by her two friends. 
 Got to Hotel De France 12 midnight. We should have got to camp that night but we risked it & stayed in all night.
