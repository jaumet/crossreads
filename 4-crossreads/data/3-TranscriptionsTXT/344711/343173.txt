2ndOn "Flying Picquet", to keep the Arabs away from the camp.  I was on foot, and the Arabs were too fast for me, so I threw stones at them.  I was wishing for a horse and a 12 ft. stockwhip.  Our horses were unfit to ride for a fortnight, and we had some solid rifle & bayonet drill.  At 12 o'clock at night I was called up to go on fatigue, to unload transport waggons.  I did not like it, after chasing niggers all day.  Worked till 4 a.m.
4thWas sent into Cairo with 12 others to guard chaff, etc., lying in railway yard.  Had very little to do, and had a good look round in Cairo.  Was surprised at the numerous nationalities to be seen.  There were English, French, Russians, Greeks, Armenians, Turks, Italians, Arabs, Soudanese, and a few Japs and Chinese.  Had a little trouble at first with Egyptian coinage, but we soon picked it up after being cheated hand over fist for a while.  Everywhere one goes there is an eternal cry for "Backsheesh".
