  
 On outpost at night by Trunie's Tel, 
 In the ghostly hours, you remember well 
 The tales of goblins, who used to dwell 
 In olden day romances. 
 For the Tel itself is a grave yard grim, 
 And, as you watch by its northern rim 
 Out file the ghosts and spectres dim 
 To hold their mid-night dances. 
   
 You see dark forms of Infidels there, 
 Who were soldiers good with courage rare; 
 But who died by the sword of a Saxon fair - 
 A chivalrous Crusader. 
 And you feel your hair from you head-top straining; 
 As you see, through the stones their life-blood's draining 
 From mortal wounds, yet still they're straining 
 To fight this new invader 
   
 But your wits fly back if you hear a rap, 
 Or down in the waddi a dry twig snap; 
 For you know that you're caught in a hopeless trap 
 If the Turkish host's advancing 
   
 But at stand-to-arms near the break of day 
 Your courage returns and you feel quite gay - 
 Still you're more than contented to ride away 
 And leave the ghosts to their dancing. 
 Windy Willie.
