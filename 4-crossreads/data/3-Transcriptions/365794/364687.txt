<p>Thursday 11 October 1917<br/>Once more we are heading due west or rather N.W. and things are as before only it is harder to settle back again.  S. Watson on the sick list, 103 etc.  Looks ill but very bright.<br/>We carry 2 Servian prisoners &ndash; deserters &ndash; in charge of the gunner.<br/>Sun rose 6 a.m. &amp; hung like a huge golden ball on the horizon for some few minutes before beginning the day's long climb.<br/>"All war news is good news" was our greeting on reaching Colombo.  I spent &pound;5-8-0 and have to show &ndash; 13 moonstones (6 large), brass bowl, sandelwood fan, w. elephant &amp; lace.  Posted kimono to Nell.<br/>Petty thieving continues.  One girl lost "one scorpion moonstone brooch" first thing.  How can they?<br/>Capt. has given quantity of lace for sisters, would that I had one piece for memento.<br/>War news continues good.  Germans fighting among themselves at last.</p>
