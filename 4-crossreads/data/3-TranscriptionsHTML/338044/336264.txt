<p>over all our travels &amp; prospects as I shall probably be leaving for front    &amp; Pal expecting to obtain his commission in England, will unfortunately break up our little party of such a long time. At 11 pm we conduct Pal to the Barrier on his way home &amp; all feeling very satisfied with our grand party so successfully carried through thanks to the able management of our capable hostess, Madame St Armand. A birthday I shall remember, far from home.</p>
<p>6th Sept:- Wednesday<br/>Don't feel inclined for work, but have to go at it hard all the time. A beautiful day. Pay all expenses of yesterday's party which cost me only 8 francs. See Legge to his tailor's to do the necessary talking &amp; spend the evening indoors writing.</p>
