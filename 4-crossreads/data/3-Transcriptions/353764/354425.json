<p>Friday 17.3.16<br/>It has been very hot here to-day &amp; also <strike>a</strike> very windy &amp; unpleasant.  Another one of our Officers is leaving us, having been appointed to a position down the Canal, you will know him when I mention that it is Mr Wells.<br/>I have not been out to-day, having had a very busy time on the lines.<br/>We take in 195 more horses in the morning which I understand will make our full complement.<br/>The 3rd Divisional Train will soon be here &amp; I understand they are a certain number of <strike>horses</strike> officers short, so my chance may come along after all, as it is it looks pretty dark on it.</p>
<p>18.3.16 Saturday &amp; 19.3.16 Sunday<br/>It is still terrible weather &amp; last night it rained very hard.  I once heard it said that that it never rained in Egypt, but since I have been here (3 months) there has been a fair average &amp; it would easily compare with Australias Summer rainfall, but of course</p>
