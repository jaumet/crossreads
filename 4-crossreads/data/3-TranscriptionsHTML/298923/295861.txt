<p>14 July 1918 Sunday<br/>I have much to tell you if I could write it all down.  <u>GERMANS</u> attacked us &amp; at 2 AM. I galloped out with my Squadron &amp; got into action just in time to save a Battery, we charged them &amp; took 176 prisoners  Machine Guns &amp; Automatic Rifles, then we were shelled very heavily by 6 inch HOWS *.  All day we got more prisoners:  Heat terrific-   Young fresh Rosy cheeked boys a lot of them &amp; Officers with "gloves" <strike>&amp; gloves</strike> &amp; walking sticks &ndash; Took 3 Officers prisoner &amp; killed a lot.  Water was our trouble, we had to stay out all night in the Trenches, the old 1st L H Brigade did very well.  We took very few Turks, all GERMANS.<br/>* 6 Inch Howitzers.</p>
