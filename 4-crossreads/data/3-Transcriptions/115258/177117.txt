<p>My dear Father</p>
<p>Its just on lights out but I hear there is a mail closing early in the morning so I must try and write a line. I have just received a note from the C.F. saying they had payed another tenner into my pay book. Thankyou very much for sending it - and it was a most pleasent surprize i can tell you. I am going over to port Said Rest Camp tomorrow morning. Discharged from hospital and I hope to get a fortnights leave, as soon as my papers get back from AIF Hqrs Cairo. The Dr asked me about a week ago if I would like sick leave and I said &#39;No&#39;. to it. However after adding up my pay book about ten times I decided I <s>g</s> could just stand a <s>tr</s> couple of days trip to Luxor so asked the &#39;quack&#39; to put me in for the leave.</p>
