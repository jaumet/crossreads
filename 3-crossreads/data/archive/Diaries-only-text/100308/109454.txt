gather. A war bitten lot and someone remarked that there not many without war ribbons. General Wisdom D.S.O. Order of St Stanislaus, Colonel Annan D.S.O. Major Wiltshire M.C. Basil Holmes [indecipherable] were undecorated. We met in a place that had been a stable at no distant date. Accused pleaded guilty and an English officer acted as Judge Advocate General. A little hitch owing to the charge sheet having been signed by General Smyth V.C. instead of Colonel Pye, the Battn. Comdr. but we got this fixed up. A sentence of cashiering was recently quashed on the grounds that the charge sheet was not signed by the Regtl. C.O. but by the Corps Commander. This rule does not apply to G.C.M's. after finishing I met my horse and orderly again and saw a "drachen" being run in to its moorings, men and bags of sand hanging all over it. Rode home for lunch ? very pleasant delightful country this. Constant
