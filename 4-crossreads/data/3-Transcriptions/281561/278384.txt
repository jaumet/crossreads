<p>five machine guns in this post, ten of us took it, for the rest of our half platoon had been shot down. Nine were killed. Advanced through wire to the right of the village; was caught in an open field by heavy rifle fire. Had a most exciting race for cover. Two were wounded in our party. Continued to wander about in Hunland until we located the Company, a very exhilarating game. Seized the Germans stores and rations including all their mail, and gained much plunder thereby. Nearly got fixed this morning, three machine gun bullets passed through my tunic in different places, and two through the haversack on my back. My good comrade Palmer was killed this morning, and many other splendid chaps. We are holding a chalk pit here on the right front of Hermico which village we hold</p>
