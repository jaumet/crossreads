<p>Friday 18th May 1917<br/>Cleaning stirrup irons all day.<br/>Left camp about 7pm with team. Went to Enges Dump at Vaux where we got a load of barbed wire and spikes which we had to take up to the support at Lagnecourt. Had a good trip up, but coming back it was dark and as I was lead driver it was hard to see the shell holes in the road. By the time we reached Vaux it was so dark that I could hardly see the road passing through the village and one of Fritz shells landed near our wagon, mules bolted but we soon had them in hand.</p>
