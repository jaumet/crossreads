 Tuesday 17 September Last night a night of incidents.  In a motor ride to C.C.S. at La Chapelete we got lost &amp; went all over the country in moonlight. Fritz bombed the other side of the village (Buire) causing casualties including killed. A most terrific storm flooded me out my place in hut. Fritz shelled the camp area causing us to take refuge in dugouts. The big stunt is for to-morrow &amp; we expect to be very busy. Dummy tanks are to be used to draw fire from the Boshe. 
 Wednesday 18 September Early this morning, after a beautiful barrage, our chaps went over in part of a general attack &amp; advanced about 6 kilos taking 1500 prisoners, 14 field guns &amp; many M.G.s.  Our casualties for the day, 1st Division are 43 &amp; very light.  Belleux &amp; Hargicourt were taken by our brigade. Plenty of work at M.D.S.
