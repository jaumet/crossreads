<p>Friday 15th<br/>Visited Billets this morning.  Made up the personal effects of Pts. Hancock &amp; Thompson &amp; forwarded them to wife &amp; Father respectively, also wrote letters to both.<br/>Everything fairly quiet today.</p>
<p>Saturday 16th<br/>This morning we got news that the French had advanced 10 kilometers (6 miles) on a depth of 3 K 1 4/5.  This is their answer apparently to the German peace proposals.<br/>Visited Billets this morning.  Weather fine &amp; clear till midday then overcast &amp; cold.  Front very quiet.</p>
<p>Sunday 17th<br/>This morning we had a visit from General Birdwood.  He came very quietly &amp; made an inspection.  Our services were interfered with.  I was expecting our men to go into the trenches so we should not have had a service.  This afternoon I gathered a few men about 35 in one of the Billets &amp; had a service.  It was a nice little service.  Text, "Thou art Simon, thou shalt be Peter".</p>
