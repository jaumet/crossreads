 Bulford 9/2/19 
 My dear all  We are having awfully cold weather just now and plenty of ice and snow for the past 3 days. We have had no water all the water pipes being frozen up and to-day it started running again and so has caused  nearly all the pipes to burst, and now nearly all the hospital has the water cut off till the repairs are done. Even the ink on my office table is frozen and most of the medicines are frozen hard. We have to melt the bottles over the stove or in hot water before we can give anyone a dose and we have plenty down with colds and influenza. By the way we have had rumours that the people of Sydney are wearing masks.
