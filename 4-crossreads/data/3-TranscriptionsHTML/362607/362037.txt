If all's well I hope to see you soon as [indecipherable] &amp; I intend to spend a few week's in Sydney in July, Fred promised this trip as we did not get over for Easter. Am sending Mr Koch a p.c. for his birthday. Hoping to hear from you very soon &amp; with love to Mr Koch, Friend &amp; your own dear self. Yours with love. Sophie.</p>
