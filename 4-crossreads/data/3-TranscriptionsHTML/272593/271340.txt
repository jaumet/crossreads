<p>time in playing Bridge"<br/>Rations have been very short of late no meat or bacon issue this morning &amp; whats worse still we had biscuits &amp; bully that made the boys cock their ears &amp; yell.<br/>Had a good long walk to our job &amp; here the parties were split up into various parties for the work allotted.<br/>Defing[?] &amp; I went up &amp; had a look at the Tank they had just fetched along, you would be surprised to see where these monsters can go, this one came down a steep slippery hill, crossed a muddy gulley &amp; climbed the opposite side taking all the old trenches &amp; holes in her track, the name of this</p>
