 1917 Tuesday 16 Jan. 
 I go to see Bob at Heally after breakfast. Found him safely in bed. very sore but nothing more serious. On the whole he was fortunate, &amp; could consider himself lucky. He will probably be evacuated in a day or two to a Gen Hosp. A heavy snow fall last night transformed the country. It is now buried under inches of a soft white mantle. Indescribably beautiful, especially to us unfamiliar to the sight. Great snowballing going on &amp; hare hunting over the frozen paddocks.
