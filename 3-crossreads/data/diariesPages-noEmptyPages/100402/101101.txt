Tuesday 9 July
A bit of a scratch match at cricket to-day. To-night I went down to the "Sentimental Blokes" near Hazebrouck, the concert was very decent. The girl was fine in fact she becomes more chic daily. A stunt is coming off to-night and we are standing by.
Wednesday 10 July
Raining to-day thundery. The stunt of last night resulted in 30 prisoners about 60 wounded for us. Visit 3rd Brigade Concert party.
