<p>with her until Saturday morning, when I catch the 10.10a.m. train from Paddington to St Ives.  Twas a pleasant journey but I inwardly kept on wishing that I had a congenial companion to enjoy things with me as that couldn't be I made up my mind to be as nice and sociable to all I came in contact with.  And really I had a very nice time indeed, with no one to please but myself yet I was never lonely, perhaps I could thank the uniform for the kindness I received from people and partly too for being alone but  must tell you.  I just took the bare necessaries that I could manage myself in a small suit case, and so be quite independent of Porters and I can assure you it pays these days when they are so scarce.  At St Ives  I went up to the Treganus Castle Hotel on the hill being advertised in Bradshaws Guide I felt it was quite safe.  It was an ideal spot too, and I was almost tempted to spend all my time there but I soon found that the air was very enervating so decided to seek one of Devonshire beauty spots, but I think I must give you my Sunday at St Ives in detail.  Most of our Sisters when going to Cornwall close Penzance, but I remember a Padre telling me once that St Ives was a place for Artists, so that was my reason for wanting to see it and really I wouldn't have missed it for anything &ndash; to wander around the old fishing village alone that is unique in its quaintness is worth a visit on its own.  And that little calm blue bay with its shores lined with fishing Smacks, that lies to the left and within the larger bay of -------.  In the background &ndash; or rather at the foot of the rolling waves, nestles the fishing village, I wish I could make you see it but its full of twists and turns and unexpected surprises.  The streets of alleys and houses are huddled up so close together &ndash; threes something angular &ndash; triangular oblong &ndash; and crookedness everywhere.</p>
