<p>21.1.18  Letter to Mollie last night. Shall have to fill my Fountain pen again. Some awfull big ones were coming over yesterday. Our artillery woke up in the afternoon &amp; passed some of the Ironware back. Robinson got special leave  <strike>yesterd</strike>  today.

<p>22.1.18   Hard up for amusement. Watching manouvres of a spider. Shortly after I lit a candle he came cautiously down a board &amp; halted just level with the top of the flame of the candle evidently enjoying the warmth. Just then a slight draught swung the flame nearly on to him. He flew for his life.   <strike>After</strike> about 5 minutes  <strike>interval</strike>  later he returned stopped at the same spot &amp; was  <strike>taken</strike>  nearly caught by the flame again. He hopped for his life. After another interval he returned once more.
