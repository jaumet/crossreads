 7/8 /19 Durban diseas . Is this due to have so much work done by nigger servant . Went down to Lord Cricket Ground and saw a team from our Ship play a Durban team . A fine ground . Come back to the boat pass the score of peopl return from work ? a polyglot lot . In one place a littl piec of India ? two women cross leg sit nurs their babi . Nostril pierc to hold gold ornament . Perhap we shall not get away until Tuesday owe to coal shortag . Remain on the ship all the even and had a bath turn in earli to sleep. Round the wharv there are alway scurri crowd of flit nativ go from nowher to the same place .
