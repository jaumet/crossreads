<p>16 Monday</p>
<p>Went on duty at 8 a.m. in dismal little gunyah &amp; found tents as terrible as I expected. Spent day finding my way around and doing my best. Went to bed early. Jean Lindsay followed me from Salonique arriving at 2 a.m. Tuesday. Went to Serb class under charming young interpreter in evening.</p>
