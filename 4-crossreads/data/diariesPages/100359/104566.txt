is famous for its roses. Here some Red x. nurses gave us tea and also pinned favors in our tunics. It is quite light although it is past 10 o'clock. La Roche was the last station I remember passing before going to sleep A big junction a Hospital Train, with its beautiful fittings and pleasant faced nurses passed. It almost makes a man wish he was wounded, so as to be able to take a ride in it.
Sunday 25th
No bloomin? Church Parade today, shunted off the line at Juvisey. Passed Versailles where we got a glimpse of the beautiful palace of Napoleon, set amidst a mass of foliage and surrounded by statuary. Paris is visible in the distance. Eiffel Tower showing up about everything. Passed St. Germaine and Confians stopped some time at Creil. Saw big guns ready for moving to the front, also passed a huge bakery, worked by French Soldiers. French girls threw kisses and we cheered, then they threw flowers and someone commence to sing "Australia will be there" which was taken up by the whole train load, and a fine bloomin? row they made. Passed Amiens 
Saw the beautiful cathedral. Passed through some very long tunnels and arrived at Abbeville about 7.30, very pretty town. We have been in the train about 52 hours,, and I haven't heard one man growl. Passed through Boulogne just as it was getting dark, then on to Etaples and Calais finally arriving at Morbecque. We were told at Etaples not to unroll our blankets as we may disentrain at any minute, but as it got towards midnight we got the shivers, and were soon inside our blankets and asleep. We reached Morbecque about 4 a.m. where the train pulled up with a terrific bump, which woke us all up. There was all excitement getting our packs loaded up.
