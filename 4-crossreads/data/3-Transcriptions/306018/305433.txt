<p>May 1917<br/>very little opposition was encountered &amp; several miles of line, Railway platforms &amp; Reservoirs were destroyed.  We left to come back at 3.30 &amp; got back to camp at 11 pm after a tiresome ride of about 18 miles most of it in the dark.  Sgt Sullivan went to hospital</p>
<p>Thursday 24th<br/>An enemy plane came over &amp; dropped several bombs.  8 or 9 men were wounded &amp; some horses killed.  An Australian mail came in  I got 3 letters, 2 from home &amp; 1 from Roy.</p>
<p>Friday 25th<br/>More bombs were dropped this morning.  The camel corps got them.  Several camels were killed don't know if any men got hit.  Got in a good supply of canteen stuff &amp; divided it amongst the troop.  The YMCA now supply the Regts in bulk &amp; the QMs divide it out.  It is a good way of keeping up extras to the troops.  Some light clothes I sent to Alex for arrived to day &amp; it was a welcome change to get the heavy old "chatty" togs off.</p>
<p>Saturday 26th<br/>Some more reinforcements arrived.  I got 3 in "B" troop &amp; am up to full strength again.  There is a certainty of us moving back for a spell in a day or two.  Only hope they give us leave as most</p>
