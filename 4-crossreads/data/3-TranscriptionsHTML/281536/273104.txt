<p>22/7/19 Chemnitz<br/>A duller day with a cool head wind and a fresh sea. Towards evening the water got as choppy as we have had it yet. For the officers there are tournaments in dominoes quoits. For the men the same as well as cards and the band playing. Quite a number of the officers are off color with bad throats. Long grey rolling seas in the evening and sometimes a school of bonitos. Bed 8 pm.</p>
<p>23/7/19<br/>A dull windy cool day. Rose at noon. a bunch of fine bad characters have meeting place outside my cabin window and sitting on the deck regale me with their crimson language &ndash; unconscious of being heard. There are useful titbits of news gleaned this way. Dancing on the promenade deck until 9.</p>
