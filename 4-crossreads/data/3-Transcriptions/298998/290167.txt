<p>my feet swelled and ached, my teeth chattered, and every bone in my body ached. I was soaked through, and laying in a pool of blood and water and covered with snow.</p>
<p>Frostbite had already effected my hands and feet. My God! the misery and agonies of that night are indescribable. Wilks tried in vain to crawl back to our lines, and I became frantic with pain.
