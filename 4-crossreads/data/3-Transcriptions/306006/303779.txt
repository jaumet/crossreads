<p>18-3-17<br/>Sun 18th<br/>I went to the Remounts this morning so soon as I had finished breakfast instead of going to church. Ben came over at 11 oclock this morning to say he cannot get away this afternoon, it was too late to apply for a pass when I got up this morning, so I faked an old one &amp; at 2.30 I was at Abassia put in an hour yarning to Roper, James &amp; Scott who are in hospital &amp; then went across to the Sisters quarters. Harris came on the scene shortly afterwards &amp; Hills, Cobb, Harris &amp; I drove in to Cairo engaged a car &amp; went to the Citadel, then for a spin around Gezerieh after tea at Groppis arriving back at Abbassia shortly after 6 oclock, left Hills there &amp;</p>
