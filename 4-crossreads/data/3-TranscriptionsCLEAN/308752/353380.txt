  
 the day will come & the Huns will get their deserts. What Military achievement is gained by these dastardly actions, it is cold blooded murder. 
 Sunday 12th November 1916. No rest for the weary 8th Field Ambulance. Bearers paraded 9 o'clock, more fatigues. Communion Service conducted by Chaplain Ward & Beverage. I have attended quite a number of these services since landing in France. I like them extremely. Prayers are always given for our loves ones at home. I naturally thought that we would have the rest of the day off, but it was not the case more work after church & another parade at 1:30 p.m.  This is called a rest after having a very strenuous time in the trenches. Believe we will shortly be back there again a few days time. 
 Monday 13th November 16. On Ward duty, 12 months since I was on nursing duties, the last time was on board the Beltana. 42 patients in ward, the rush of wounded so heavy that a great number of the sick fellows are neglected. However I put all my patients in a good humour. 
 Wednesday 15th November 16. Startling news today, the weary 8th Bearers proceeded in the direction of the Straffe again. It was a bitterly cold day & we all felt rather miserable. At 5 p.m. we arrive at our destination, & start work immediately & unload the Red Cross Cars, & put the patients into the train. A good job better
