 My dearest father, Since I last wrote, no Australian mail has come in, but there are rumours afloat that a mail is due in to-morrow so perhaps I will hear then.  I hope that you are all keeping in the best of health at home; on my part I am keeping in splendid condition here, and am very happy in my work. The weather here has been very stormy  here  for some time past now; very strong Westerly winds, & gusty too, & rain at least twice a day.  On top of this, ground fogs drift in from the Bristol Channel, & make things unpleasant as a rule.  The district is of a very clayey nature and in consequence of the continual rain, the ground is very slippery & treacherous.  One of our mechanics starting up an engine a few days ago, slipped; the engine starting, caused the revolving prop. to catch his arm, breaking it instantly.  So very simply done too. I took up a new type of machine yesterday to the kind I generally fly.  I climbed to 4,000 & tried my hand at some fancy flying- looping the loop, spinning, & 1/2 rolls.
