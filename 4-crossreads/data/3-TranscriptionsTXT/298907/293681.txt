 Oh how I fain would be today "Australia" with thee 
 The cattle I see grazing In the fields of verdant green Across the plain my dear old home The fairest to be seen My dear sweet faced old mother, And the dear grey haired old dad, Are waiting in Australia To welcome home their lad. 
 My countree how I miss thee When I'm in strange lands alone My heart will ever be with thee My countree &amp; my home My eyes they oft are dim with tears My heart is full of pain For Australia &amp; the homefolk I ne'er might see again.
