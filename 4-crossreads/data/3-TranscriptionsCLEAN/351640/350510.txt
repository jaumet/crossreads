  
 The site is not mentioned with accuracy in Exodus, therefore some doubt surrounds it. 
 9-30 p.m.  We are abreast of Ismalia & expect to be at Port Said about 4 a.m. 13.1-15. 
 The banks of the Canal are closely guarded by soldiers from India.  Every yard, about, of it has armed men ready to pounce upon any one.  All sorts of rumours float about the ship in regard to an attack by arabs.  How much or how little of truth is in them no one knows.  I have been told, & believe it to be true that we go from Port Said to Alexandria.  If so it will be a new place for me to see.  It may be that my next letter will be from there. 
 Good night, & for the present good bye my dears. 
 Please give my best wishes to Maria, and my other friends. 
 To yourselves go heaps of love and loads of kisses.  Often are you in my thoughts & do I pray for you. 
 Your loving & affecte. Faree John B. Nash
