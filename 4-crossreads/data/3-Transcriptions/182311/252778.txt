<p>sped on to Yarmouth, a little town that has quite a romantic history, having twice been sacked and burned by the French until Charles the First appointed a friend, an old soldier of Fortune, Sir Robert Holmes as Captain of Wight, this man&#39;s statue is in the church, and he is the local hero and a romantic figure too.&nbsp; Through Parkhurst and on to Carisbrook, where we visited the Castle but were not permitted to enter, greatly to our sorrow, but still we saw quite a lot before we were stopped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The front at Cowes was very interesting but rather sadly so, for it was lined with hospital ships with their loads of misery, even the Aqatania being there on that sad errand; we crossed the Medina by ferry, then on to Osborne House, which was quite a disappointment, a prosy, mid-Victorian erection, but the church at Whippingham used by royalty is very old, interesting, and carefully kept and restored.&nbsp; Then, as we are now well/on the way back to Ryde we make one call at Quarr Abbey and then after picking up our baggage take steamer back to Southsea, thence to Hayling Island and work again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This method of seeing the country is certainly the most effective of all and in addition if you make a party the cost of the car is well divided and most economical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In my next I will tell you of our return to Lark Hill via Southampton, or rather, I&#39;ll do it now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Finding that with our passes we could return to camp by a route different from the one by which we/left</p>
