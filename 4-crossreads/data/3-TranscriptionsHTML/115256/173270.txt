<p>Monday 11 January 1915</p>
<p>Crossed the line at 1.40 early this morning;  so there was practically no undue excitement with the one exception of a little horseplay in the sergeants' mess, as was plainly seen by the dilapidated appearance of those worthies at the early parade.  Boot polish stains are likely to remain on some "dials" for quite a time to come as a result of the evening's frivolity.</p>
<p>To-day, in the presence of the Brigadier and our own Colonel, an inter-company tug-of-war was held.  Enthusiasm ran high and the betting was very brisk, each man wanting to lay his "screw", or, at any rate, the greater part of it, on the team representing his own company.  After several closely contested "pulls", "G" company won the right to contest the "South of the Murray" team;  this is set down for to-morrow.  It is remarkable how these tests of strength create a friendly feeling of rivalry between each company of a regiment, Sport, pure and [amateurish?] as opposed to base professionalism.</p>
