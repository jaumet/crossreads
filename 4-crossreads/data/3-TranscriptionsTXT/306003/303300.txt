26.3.16Sun 26thRoute marches were cut out today on account of the Sabbath, & an message was delivered to Major Smith at 2 oclock this afternoon by a messenger from Tukh-El-Khail with the result that A & B troop had orders to be ready at 4 oclock to move out on patrol, & it set us wondering whether the aeroplanes had seen anything or not;  Men were also sent out from Ezbet-Soo-Doun & Tukh-El-Khail
Smithers arrived back from the Sig School & brought back a 1st Class Signallers Certificate with him, & as old Joe Tomlinson also got his, I am inclined to think that the exam is not a very hard one;  Tomlinson got drunk at Cairo & missed the train coming home
