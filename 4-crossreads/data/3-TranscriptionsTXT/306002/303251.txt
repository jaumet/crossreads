 19.8.15 Thurs. 19th.  Stan &amp; Les went to the beach yesterday afternoon after coming off duty &amp; managed to buy some milk &amp; this morning we bought a tin of cocoa-milk from Chivers.  Stan also got a tin of Curry yesterday so we are well in the joke at present, we have also had two issues of bread since Sunday.  We have been working the 'phone at Hintons Post since we came off Popes Hill, 24 hrs. on &amp; 24 off so we are faring fairly well. 
 20.8.15 Fri. 20th.  We came of [off] duty at dinner time.  Stan &amp; I went to the beach for a swim &amp; to see if we could buy any luxuries, one tin of maconochie for 1/- was the result.  A good deal of shrapnel was flying about the beach &amp; I had two attempts to have a swim, but gave it up as the shrapnel was dropping too handy.
