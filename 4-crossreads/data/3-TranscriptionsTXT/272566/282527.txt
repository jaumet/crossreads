 Sunday 25 March 
 A glorious day. German observation balloons can be seen in the distance.  Big explosion occurred in the Town Hall cellars Bapaume today.  Fritz apparently left mines which are exploded on the 8 day clock system.  About 40 men are imprisoned underneath and their voices can be heard from the surface of the ground.  Men are working for their very lives in trying to rescue the others below.
