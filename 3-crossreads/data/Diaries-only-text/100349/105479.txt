Still hanging fire here. The railway construction job is finished there are more stiring things forward. Went for a bath. Met Syd Chisholm and George Doyle, they have just returned to the Battalion. Paid 20 Franc's.
4/11/17.
Drew our fighting gear; bombs, grenades, etc. Was inspected. Warned to proceed to the line in the morning. I have slipped a lot in condition lately. Went and saw the new O.C. about my promotion, he reckons that it has not been gazetted yet. Captain Hewish's death was a great loss to the company. He was a very fine solider.
