<p>16 January, 1916<br/>Maadi<br/>Went into Cairo to get my teeth yesterday. when I got in I found that I had left money at home &amp; had to return to camp to get it. Teeth don't feel too good have to go in again. Had a good time in town and got home very much after hours. J Woods Stevens and Hughes returned on [indecipherable]  Joe &amp; Steve are in the troop but Hughes is [indecipherable] it hard to get in.  It is all drill &amp; there is a great getting together of gear &amp; a route march on Tuesday.  I think we must be getting away very soon.<br/>Later  I took a walk up to Maadi &amp; went into the Soldiers Club. It was run by the folk of Maadi. One can get a cup of tea &amp; two pieces of bread &amp; butter for 1 Piastre &ndash; They are good folk; give all their time &amp; just run it for the benefit of the Soldiers</p>
