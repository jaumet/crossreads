<p>7th   This morning I went out near Longueval to locate &amp; make a rough survey of a proposed railway which is to be made from the present railhead to Longueval dump.  We were handicapped considerably by the rain which increased during the afternoon &amp; we had to return.  The mud is getting worse around here &amp; it is almost impossible to move about in it.  We have been issued with long rubber boots which are a great help, as the ordinary boots are of little use.  This afternoon we were served out with cigarettes &amp; tobacco sent to us by the "Southern Cross Tobacco Fund" organised by the "Overseas Club."</p>
