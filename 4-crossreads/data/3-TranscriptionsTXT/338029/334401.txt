just after dinner and they found a few things dirty as might be expected, they sent in a strafing report, but the officers and Doc. are sticking to me.  It made me feel more like a rebel than any previous Tommyism.
Thursday 29thWhilst we were enjoying ourselves at our sports meeting our gallant comrades attacked El-Arish and took it, the great reports coming through make me mad to think I am not participating, as they have the enemy on the run.  It is cruel not to be in at the death, but it is my own fault for ever transferring into such a show regt. as this.
Friday 30thMore victories for our mates.  Magadaba has fallen and the Turks are in full retreat towards Bersheba, Light Horse doing wonderful work, whilst we are holding a sports meeting.
Saturday 31stThey are fighting like Hell and are now in fertile country whilst we are still in the desert.  It was the last day of our sports,  B Squadron won the pennant but I did not pay a great deal of attention to it being too disgusted with the regt.
