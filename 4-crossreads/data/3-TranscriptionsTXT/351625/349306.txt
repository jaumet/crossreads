 a few more shares in the business.  I am also glad to hear you have been at home so much of late.  Mother says she is getting quite fat which I am very glad to hear.  I have not heard from Ken yet since he went to Blighty a great bit of luck he had especially as promotion is hard to get with such short service unless one has someone behind him but he will make a good officer &amp; is very popular amongst the lads.  I have just about exceeded my writing limit so will close.  Give my love to all. 
 I remain Your affectionate Son Douglas.
