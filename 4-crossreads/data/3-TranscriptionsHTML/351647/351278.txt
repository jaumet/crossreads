<p>I see Stewart Walker was wounded</p>
<p>France or thereabouts<br/>14 September</p>
<p>My dear Mrs. Jack,</p>
<p>Just a few lines to tell you I received the parcel &amp; to thank you so much for the contents.  The silk sweater is just great, beautiful &amp; in the absence of pyjamas I sleep in it &amp; it is O.K.  The muffler is a joy too &amp; the socks too, although they did cause rather a sensation.  It was sweet of you to make them for me &amp; I simply can't tell you how I appreciate them.  The book came also, I haven't read it yet, I've been so busy here.  We are suppose I think to be resting but I still have to go hard.  It's a sweet place &amp; we have good quarters but the weather is rotten worse luck.  I could stay here for ages but we are almost certain to move off again before</p>
