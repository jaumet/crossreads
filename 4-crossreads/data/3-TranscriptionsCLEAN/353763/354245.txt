The thing about Suva is the greenness - the sward is very fine  -  The Botanic gardens are more like a big green park than any other gardens I've seen - a glorious carpet of green with hibiscus hedges - Hibisci do very well in this soft moist climate  -  The double scarlet one is a thing of beauty  -  The cricket ground also possesses a grand turf wicket & the outfield must be excellent  -  Really all this verdure grows on some 2 feet of humus on the tip of sandstone rock  -  Albizzias abound  -  They are a kind of Acacia - Rawdon knows them  -  We had a fine one next the police station in the hospital grounds at Gayndah   -  Victoria parade is lined with them & on then - covering their trunks & branches is a fern - a polypody  -  Ferns do well in this damp land  -  In the axils of leaves of a Palm in the Botanic gardens ferns had been planted from top to bottom & flourished exceedingly - fronds being 2 feet & more - Hare's foot fern grew splendidly there  -
