who are excellent bush-cooks; considering their previous environment. Potatoes are obtainable through the Jews. We often exchange canned meat for them. Indeed vegetables are essential, when living entirely on canned food; otherwise we would never allow English food to pass out of our hands.
10th-17th   My most recent discovery is a small compartment in a spare barrack, used by Englishmen on Sundays. Several energetic men have arranged a regular service, which makes our miserable lives more bearable. I have also found lots of English literature, forwarded through the British Red Cross Society, so I spend most of my time devouring books or studying French.
