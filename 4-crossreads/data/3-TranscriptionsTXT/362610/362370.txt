Saturday 3 June 1916A rather duller day with a steady NW wind. In the morning had to take the reinforcements who had recently joined up along to the gas school at Nouveau Monde, abt. 1 1/2 mls. away. The school is held in a most beautiful residence where it is stated the Crown Prince was billeted when the Germans held this part. A large house beautifully appointed & furnished & surrounded by delightful gardens & shrubberies kept in perfect order. The beeches, elms, poplars, acacias (in bloom) & conifers looked their best, & in the beds were good roses (Earl of Dufferin) in bloom, pansies, geraniums, lupins &c. In the vegetable patch were peas, beans, carrots, tomatoes, lettuce, globe artichoke, onions &c., with several rows of sturdy strawberries on which the fruit was just turning colour. Altogether a lovely home.Had to take the party down to the river bank where they were put thro' gas, & on reaching home found that Capt. Cotton (2nd in command) had returned from London leave. The company was on fatigue in the afternoon & after tea Lt. Cullenward left on leave to  London. Had a "Society" gathering & tea together in Sailly, getting home abt. 9 o'c.
