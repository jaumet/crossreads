<p>"High Wood" now merely a bunch oh ragged &amp; smashed timber with all the ground pockmarked with shell holes it was in the fight for this wood that one of the Gloucester regiments I think was just about wiped out. At the bottom of this wood there is a great wooden cross erected by the officers &amp; men who fell in the fight for it, one can easily understand why  the Germans struggled so hard to hold it for stretching a couple of miles behind it is pretty level ground &amp; this afforded the Huns no protection at all although they had deeply dug trenches &amp; masses of barbed wire protecting them but our guns smashed their defences to pieces as you can see as you go over the ground.<br/>Just on the edge of this wood there</p>
