 Duty.   The fine weather of yesterday was short lived.   Snow fell again &amp; today is raw &amp; cold with strong wind. McB &amp; I go off on another stroll after tea.   Visit High Wood, that place where perhaps the fiercest fighting took place &amp; doesn't it show it   Fritzs Highlanders &amp; Tommies' bones  lie bleaching in the weather.   Skulls lying round stark &amp; staring &ndash; a gruesome sight.   Visit Delville Wood &amp; home again. We get orders to move up the line in the morning. Receive 4 letters advance guard one each from Bob, Miss Barbara Alec A &amp; Alice McA.
