<p><u>31st. March, 1917.</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;The Hun has hopped it.&quot;&nbsp; These were the</p>
<p>words which spread like wildfire amongst the troops behind the line</p>
<p>one day towards the end of February.&nbsp;&nbsp; Various rumours were current</p>
<p>as to how far back he had gone and these varied from a matter of</p>
<p>possible evacuation to a position bringing Arras, Cambrai and</p>
<p>Verdun into roughly one straight line and as it turned out those</p>
<p>who staked their faith on this possibility were not far wrong</p>
<p>except that instead of xxx going direct back the enemy withdrew by</p>
<p>stages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On our front, the fact of him having evacuated</p>
<p>his trenches was detected by a corporal in charge of a scouting</p>
<p>party.&nbsp;&nbsp; The night was very dark and yet Fritz&#39; flares usually so</p>
<p>plentiful were few and far between whilst his fire seemed to be</p>
<p>confined to one machine gun somewhere in rear of his front line and</p>
<p>a couple of snipers.&nbsp; After a time the snipers and flares ceased</p>
<p>altogether and the corporal who had been sent out to reconnoitre</p>
<p>crept up through his barbed wire and looked into his trenches and</p>
<p>before daylight the Divisions on our right and left had moved up</p>
<p>also.&nbsp; But how far had he gone?&nbsp; Scouts were immediately sent out</p>
<p>to get in touch with the enemy, and they soon found him entrenched</p>
<p>about a mile back.&nbsp; All this ground was new to us and it had to</p>
<p>be carefully gone over before the main troops could be brought up,</p>
<p>not at all an easy matter in the dark.&nbsp; However morning found us</p>
<p>entrenched opposite him about 200 yards away.&nbsp; The Butte of</p>
<p>Warlencourt (a comical shaped hill like Mount Renny in Moore</p>
<p>Park)&nbsp; from which the enemy could previously comand observation</p>
<p>over our territory for miles back, was now behind us instead of</p>
