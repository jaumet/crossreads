<p>Bulford<br/>3.10.17<br/>Dear Dad,<br/>Your letters of the 5th, 21st &amp; 29th July and 12 Aug. all arrived within a few days of one another.  I have not had the chance to answer them before now.  I am on Duty to-night but have taken a risk &amp; slipped away to try &amp; write to you.<br/>I did not receive a parcel from Mrs Whitehead.  It was probably lost on the Voyage.  Thank Her for me all the same.  I think that I wrote to her Myself.  Do not let People waste their money on Us, Dad.  We have all that we want except lots of money.  But we have to go slowly &amp; spin the money out.  You did have a task getting to Newport up that long Hill.  I have done it Myself.  We have 5 Hills like that on the way to Salisbury &amp; 5 coming back.  But I am good on the Bike now &amp; never get off.  Of Course the roads are perfect &amp; I only have a 72 &percnt; Gear.<br/>I will be anxiously waiting to hear of the various pony drives that You make.  For goodness sake don't let Mum go out on her own &amp; have the blessed pony bolt with Her.<br/>You mention Frank Gibson.  I suppose You got the letter in which we related meeting His Brother Charlie who played with the Old Burwood band.  He was in the Aust. Flying Corp.  It was sad about Frank's Boy being</p>
