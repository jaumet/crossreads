  
 we eventually arrived at what is known as The Green Dump.  Here we were still something like four miles from the actual firing line.  The Green Dump was just a number of more or less destroyed dug-outs on the sloping side of a hill, & the surrounding batterys, stores, & railway line made it a much desired target for Fritz, & as a consequence a rather unhealthy situation for a residence.  It was here our ambulance lost several of its men in killed & wounded.  This was our return station after each stretch of 48 hrs. in the line, & where we returned for the intervening 24 hrs. for a sleep & brush-up.
