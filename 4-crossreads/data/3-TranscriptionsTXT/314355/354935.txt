 Dear Frank 
 Enclosed also Conrad's 'Typhoon'.  Asked Beaumont to send over one of his best as I remembered you had read him.  Then came this copy. 
 Have you finished with Poetry Review, or any other good thing you have in its place.  V/cs, I found 'The Way of All Flesh', a most thoughtful &amp; suggestive book.  Regards, Bob.
