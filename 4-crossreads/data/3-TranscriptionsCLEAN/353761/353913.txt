First Haw  Eye Witness Description of an air battle & the destruction of Allied Observation Balloons At a spot that might best be described as being somewhere in France there are several small military huts and a number of newly erected tents within easy stepping distance of a Peasants house. Here, with his staff of officers and men, is camped the C.R.E. of a particular Division of the Australian Army Corps. In one of the huts there is a soldier studying a war map whereon is marked, in vivid red, the front line of the Allies and, in bright blue, that of the enemy. Probably the map shows no new development of importance for the soldier raises his head with the manner of one who   need  has no need to be concerned and he glances with untroubled eyes through the small window that gives him light.
