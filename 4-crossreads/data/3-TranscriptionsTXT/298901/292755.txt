 Thursday 18th July Showery &amp; close.  Had a few shells in our neighbourhood but not dangerously so.  News from French front very good, they standing their ground &amp; counterattacking. 
 Friday 19th July A fine day &amp; very quiet.  Fritz raided the 29th last night &amp; captured a few men, we had a few patients through both gassed &amp; wounded.  Had the pleasure today of seeing two Hun balloons brought down, one of which had nearly reached the ground but our flyer followed it down.  There is also good news from the French front, it so far being official that the ordinary line troops attacked on a 24 mile front &amp; captured guns &amp; a few thousand prisoners advancing some 6 miles, very cheering news. 
 Saturday 20th July Papers scarce again as is usual during the fighting so have not the good oil of whats doing, we know however that the French have taken 23,000 prisoners which is very good.  At 9 A.M. this morning we brought down a Fritz balloon much to the lads gratification
