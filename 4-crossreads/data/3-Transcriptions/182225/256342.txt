<p>1916 &nbsp; FRIDAY 11 &nbsp; AUGUST</p>
<p>Fine &amp; hot but cloudy. Out signalling with the mob again all day. I was very stiff after the football &nbsp;match yesterday, but it did me a world of good. The battery&nbsp;<s>goes&nbsp;</s>went on duty at 6 pm but I am exempt from all duties being a signaller so did not get anything to do. I finished &quot;Aunt Sarah &amp; the War&quot; &amp; I liked it very much. There is a lot of sound common sense in it. I would give anything to be able to write letters ect like the ones Owen Tudor wrote.</p>
<p>Campbell told me we would be in the firing line in eight weeks. Just see how true this prophesy is.</p>
