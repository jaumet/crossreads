<p><u>Friday 15th Feb. 18</u><br/>On guard last night, but very easy &ndash; nothing doing. Actually I spent five minutes on the post, first, joining there at 10 pm (my spell started at 2 AM). I found darkness &amp; mud outside &amp; darkness &amp; chewing horses inside the stable. The first relief had gone off &amp; the second was in bed.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x<br/>Rose at revile &amp; spent the morning in writing a burlesque and doing some washing. The burlesque is first a short one in preparation for the next concert.</p>
