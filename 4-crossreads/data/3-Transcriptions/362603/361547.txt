<p>Australian Army Medical Corps, A.I.F. letterhead as before.<br/>Bulford, Salisbury.<br/>Address reply to Staff<br/>12th November<br/>Dear Dad, &amp; Mum &amp; George,<br/>I have Dad's letters of the 19/9/17, 2/9/17 10/9/17, 16/9/17, 23/9/17, Mum's of the same dates &amp; Georgies of 11.9.17 to answer.
