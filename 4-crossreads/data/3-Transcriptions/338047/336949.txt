<p>1919<br/>Feb<br/>these froggies are just living in disused houses until the Government does something towards fixing up their homes. &ndash; nearly all places like Peronne or some of the villages that have been knocked out of recognition.  Occasionally one will see a big hand cart coming down the road, all the family furniture on it with madam m'selle &amp; monsieur trudging after it &ndash; going home - &amp; perhaps their home has been knocked to smithereens (end of letter)<br/>There was a good deal of pyorrhea amongst the inhabitants of these villages, &amp; a rather curious order came out to the effect that the troops were to abstain from kissing them (not bad for the military).<br/>The flu became rather prevalent, &amp; the dances were stopped &amp; the cinema was closed down for some days.  A few of our men got it but not many.  As soon as the weather started to improve I commenced going for long walks.  I went with Hawkins one day over to Felleries about 4 kilo away.  There was a Fritz train there that he had had to abandon, blowing up the line on either side.  It was packed</p>
