<p>October, 1915<br/>Saturday 16<br/>Went Cairo to get some gold &amp; sundry <u>Kit</u> ready for my second Marching out &ndash; I wonder what will be in store this time!!!<br/><strike>Going to dinner with Mardi &amp; Miss Cook tonight at their Pension Heliopolis She gave me a book 2 Kharki handkerchiefs &amp; a Pipe from Aunt Louie &amp; Kathleen. Please thank them in case</strike> I cannot write as I am very busy now but hope to do so ere I leave, am taking plenty of paper &amp; envelopes &ndash; My job in Camp has been to open dead men's letters &amp; re-address them to senders or destroy if advisable, a pathetic job &ndash; people should <u>sign</u> in full.</p>
