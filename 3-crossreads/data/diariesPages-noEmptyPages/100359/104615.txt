it heavily every day and there is hardly a single house without a shell hole through it. We arrived at the Baths at about 3 and had a most enjoyable hot bath and a change of clothes which were all "brand new" Then we went on to Esquingham to the Baths we used to run. The 104th English F.

Last night was just dozing off when our Artillery and Trench Mortars started a terrific bombardment, which lasted about an hour.Our dug-outs fairly shook and sleep was out of the question.

Was killed (shrapnel through the neck) and a m/gun Sergeant got his nose split clean in two. He called Fritz some awful names over it, as he was to have gone home on leave next Monday Mac and I took him in and when we returned we made a cup of tea, which wa very enjoyable. After Break, we took in poor Lieut.Esmonde. He is only a bit of a kid, about 19 or 20, and has only been here about a month. We had B.Beef and Baked potatoes for dinner again today.
