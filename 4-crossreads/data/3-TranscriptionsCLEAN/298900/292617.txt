  
 to Paris Plage passing everything on our way, the distance being 5 kilos.   Paris Plage  itself is a beautiful place, quite famous & one of the best watering places. The buildings are fine & of special architecture many being of swiss design.   The beach is exceptionally fine & in the season must be a splendid sight.   At night when the place was lit up it was a grand sight, the streets being filled with soldiers & people & the shops being of a high class character gave the place quite an air of jollity.    We had tea here and it was quite good.   After visiting the various sights such as the English Church, Gardens etc etc we caught the 7 oclock tram back to Etaples & walked from there to Cormont making in all 14 miles for the days walk. 
 Monday 21st      Felt well after the walk and did a couple of miles before tea.   Tried my hand at French again.  Lovely weather.
