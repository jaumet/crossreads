Thursday 5 October 1916No rain during the day but very muddy underfoot in most places. In the morning went right along the line testing the pressure of the horns &c., & was interested to see the results of the enemy's bombardment the previous night. Had to stay in during the afternoon on a/c of the Brigade Major & others being out. Later went to the M.M.G. Co. H.Q. to arrange about their respirator fitting. Brigadier went to Division temporarily in command.
