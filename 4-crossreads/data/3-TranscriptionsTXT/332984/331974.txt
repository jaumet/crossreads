 4.10.1916   Again wet and miserable.  The same old complaint, mud over your boot tops  Everything quiet  during this weather.  Getting on slowly with our stables.  A number of men suffering from boils.  Weather too rough for aeroplanes. 
 5.10.1916   Bty is coming out of action in a day or two.  The weather is fine, and mild.  A few shell about the Bty.  One of our mules wounded at Lille gate last night.  This is a dangerous spot, swept by machine gun fire every night. 
 6.10.1916   Fine but cloudy Bty coming out of action tomorrow.  Shoeing Smith Heyden gone to Hospital, something wrong with his throat.  Tonight is windy and rough, Artillery active. 
 7.10.1916   A few isolated showers, with a fierce wind, Bty coming out tonight
