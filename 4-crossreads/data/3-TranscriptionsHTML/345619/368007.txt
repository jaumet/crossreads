<p>I wonder did I say thank you for all your letters the other day? and I would just love to have a washer, the other one is worn out now, so perhaps you will make me one some day. and please tell Mum if she hasn't sent some snaps of all my family, that I want some soon. Goodbye little boy love from Dad.<br/>XXXXXXXXX<br/>XXXXXXXXXX</p>
