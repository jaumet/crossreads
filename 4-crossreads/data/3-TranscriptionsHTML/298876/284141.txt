<p>Wednesday<br/>1/3/16</p>
<p>Very muggy all day &amp; night, sea very calm. Land came to view about 7 am. Typical Picture book country of Arabian &amp; Egyptian country, very mountainous quite a study in almost every ridge &amp; mount &ndash; mostly of a very barren dry appearance. So different to our Australian Country &amp; even the mountains are a novelty &ndash; shapes pointed &ndash; some conical &ndash; some as in terraces &ndash; some perfectly round &ndash; oval &amp; so on.</p>
<p>First glimpse of civilization since Colombo, is to see a business like fort on the Arabian side. I think they said X "Fort Mocha" &ndash; also an inlet or secluded Bay <hand drawn sketch> thus for cruisers etc to shelter load &amp; coal etc. Then we came to several picturesque Islands &ndash; one they said Solitary Islands &amp; their imposing Light Houses or Wireless</p>
