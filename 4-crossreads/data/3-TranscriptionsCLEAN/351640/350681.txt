  
 At this time of the year a Dragoman (guide) meets one outside with the sentence:-  "Colonel do you desire a day's shooting?" - What is there to shoot? - "Plenty of quail now to be found during an afternoon near the camp."  What will the half day cost?  "From 140 to 160 Piastres."  This is about 30/-.  How strange?  When one thinks back, and looks up the Old Testament Ex c.16-4.  "Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law or no." " c.16-12  "I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel; speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God."  "13. And it came to pass, that at even the Quails came up and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host."  "14. And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness, there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground."  "15. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is Manna, for they wist not what it was.  And Moses said to them, "This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat!" 
 In following verses Moses instructs them as to baking the Manna in order to keep it over the Sabbath, because without cooking it fermented worms thriving upon it. 
 "27. And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day to gather Manna, and they found none." "30. So the people rested on the 7th day.  Hence the seventh day is to this day the Sabbath according to the Jewish ritual." "31. And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna; and it was like coriander seed white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey." 35. And the children of Israel did eat Manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat Manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan."
