<p>[Sketch with the title "Church Plan Borre".]<br/>May 19<br/>The big gas shelling for tonight seemingly postponed again.  Now about 2 a.m., only one stretcher case through &ndash; a 3rd Batt. officer, with the tiniest of wounds in the thigh, carried in from the car.  Les put him on a stretcher, and the shell dressing removed, revealed a scratch and faint spotting of blood.</p>
<p>Two Tommy runners, down from Pradelles through Borre, wearing shorts.  Three R.S.B.'s going up to Strazeele:  one mouths an oath with &ndash;</p>
<p>"Got them bloody running pants on &ndash; only want them spiked shoes!"</p>
<p>Passing the M.G. Camp this morning, they doing physical jerks under an instructor, and the sun burning down, coming back they were ranged in parties about other instructors &ndash; they swinging loaded ropes in a circle, the chaps jumping over them as they swung under their feet.</p>
<p>Late yesterday afternoon a 1st Batt. chap through, Ted, asked him what they'd done down at Sercus.</p>
<p>"Oh drilled Christ out of us!"</p>
<p>The 1st Brigade were "resting" and the M.G.s are in reserve.</p>
