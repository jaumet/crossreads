 My dear Father 
 Its just on lights out but I hear there is a mail closing early in the morning so I must try and write a line. I have just received a note from the C.F. saying they had payed another tenner into my pay book. Thankyou very much for sending it - and it was a most pleasent surprize i can tell you. I am going over to port Said Rest Camp tomorrow morning. Discharged from hospital and I hope to get a fortnights leave, as soon as my papers get back from AIF Hqrs Cairo. The Dr asked me about a week ago if I would like sick leave and I said 'No'. to it. However after adding up my pay book about ten times I decided I  g  could just stand a  tr  couple of days trip to Luxor so asked the 'quack' to put me in for the leave.
