<p>the rain pouring down on us when we got dismissed in a hurry &amp; got our capes on the rain stopped so we spent the rest of the afternoon while about Durrington village.  There was a little old church we visited that was very interesting, it had massive old oak doors that must have been hundreds of years old, every different part of it denoted different ages, the vicar came along so we asked him how old it was, he did not know exactly but said he had records of the vicars for 700 years back</p>
