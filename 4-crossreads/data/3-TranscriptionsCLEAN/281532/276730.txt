6/10/18 Beaurevoir Nauroy
Our time was today put back an hour. A raw day and dull. Marched to trenches and bivouacs near Hervilly. Just near the Canal passed a terribly congested waterpoint with a thousand horses at least. We marched over deserted country for miles and ended up at L22 where were dugouts & shelters. At 5 pm rode to Hesbecourt Church where all the CO.s of the Division were assembled and met General Rosenthal who told us G.H.Q said there was talk of Germany & Austria wanting an armistice. He also discussed the matter of the 21st disbanding and ordered that it be proceeded with at once. Returned to BnH.Q. and held a conference of O.C.s discussing the recent battles that we took part in. All were tired out and glad to turn in.
