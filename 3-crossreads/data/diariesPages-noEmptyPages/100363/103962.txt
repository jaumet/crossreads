with horses and men, and the unending streams of accompanying camel transport. Our Headquarters have their tents pitched in what was once an old "figgery". It is a pleasant spot, sandy and dry and isolated from the other camping. What astonishes one is the threat size of the fig trees, and the density of their growth - more so, as their owners apparently pay little or no attention to pruning or fertilising. I am greatly pleased with the hospitality and assistance given me by the Headquarters Staff, nothing is too much trouble or difficult for them to have done, and this I recognise as the biggest half of my work done.
