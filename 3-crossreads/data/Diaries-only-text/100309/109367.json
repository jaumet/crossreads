3/6/17 Bouzincourt
Sunday. The Battalion paraded at 11 am on the parade ground and Padre Lamble conducted the service preaching an excellent sermon. The Band played excellently. Had an inspection of hair etc. on this parade and found it fairly satisfactory on the whole. After lunch had P.V. Martin up and gave him a bar for his medal. He was full of trouble and we went into matters carefully regarding pay etc. and also what punishment was to be dished out to him when he would appear later in the afternoon at Orderly Room. After a talk we compromised on some C.B. as he objected to getting entries in his paybooks being already overdrawn. The Australian Army again!. "Mr. Wiltshire is a just man"! I tried a case of brawling round an estaminet. At dinner the band gave a number of items playing very well. Thurley is a good conductor. Monsieur took a photo of some of the "bats" in battle order out on the back door step.
