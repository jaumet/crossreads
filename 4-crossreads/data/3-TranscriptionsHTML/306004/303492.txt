<p>20.8.16<br/>Sun 20th<br/>A Sqdn went on swimming parade today, &amp; at 9 oclock Ted Mills &amp; I also decided to go &amp; it was well worth the 5 mile ride<br/>Mahomediah  is a picture the Hospitals are on the Beach within a few yards of the sea off which a cool breeze is constantly blowing, &amp; it looks like a small town with electric engines running on the line to Railhead;  At Railhead a party of Tommies are kept busy all day filling thousands of Fantasses which are brought empty &amp; taken away full by a constant stream of Egyptians &amp; Indian Camel transports, all the Indians are armed but no Egyptian is allowed to carry any weapons;<br/>An Armored Train is also at</p>
