  
 you have been very kind to her and the boy.  I am somewhat loth to speak on this subject, but still you have continually shown such marked sympathy & kindness to them both that, although I am afraid thanks would offend you, I want you to know that I am very grateful and appreciate what you are doing. 
 I am still classed temporarily unfit but that might finish any day now.  I think I am getting all your letters although they take time, coming back from France. 
 Best wishes to yourself and Daphne. 
 Your affect. Son, George
