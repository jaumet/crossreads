I am afraid I cannot help you at all to get him to Millbank; the CCS's have nothing to do with a patient's future hospital; in fact we never know the base hospital in France & often not even the town to which he is transferred. Your  les best way I think would be to write to him at the base Hospital in France, but I am rather doubtful whether you can secure his transfer to Millbank.
The Military authorities do not allow anyone to visit patients in CCS's, but if a patient is in a base Hospital & is "dangerously ill", permission can be obtained. As Fergusson is will not probably be put on     wha  the "D.I." List at the base, I am afraid you will not have much chance of obtaining permission.
