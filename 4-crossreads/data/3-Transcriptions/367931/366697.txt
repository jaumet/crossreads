<p>Joncret<br/>Belgium<br/>18.4.18</p>
<p>My dear Colonel,<br/>Your welcome letter of Dec 24th received by me a few days ago &amp; was pleased to see you had reached "the land of sun" safely. I can quite imagine your disappointment at not being with us when the end came. Since then we have had a very easy time &amp; have been billeted in villages near Chaleroi. The show is nearly finished now &amp; my commands consist of Cramp &amp; two 2/Lts, 50 men (1918 enlistment) &amp; 9 horses. The whole Div. expects to be clear of here by the middle of May. Gleeson went to HQ London a few days ago &amp; Mac Keown on draft. I leave here with the next draft &amp; and expect to embark from England for home about the middle of May. We were very disappointed in not sending a force to garrison the Rhine, as we considered we had earned a place there. I have just arrived back from a 16 days tour to there &amp; northern Belgium. As the account of it is so long I had it typed &amp; am enclosing a copy for you. A few days ago I wrote to the Comforts Depot thanking them for</p>
