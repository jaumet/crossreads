<p>4 Monday<br/>4 squads out of A Section &amp; B Section fell in 6 am &amp; entrained at Longueval for Dernancourt &amp; from Dernancourt we marched to the Anzac Rest station just out of Buire a distance I suppose of about three miles.  It is a beautiful clear day but there is rather a sharp wind blowing.  The rest of the Ambulance went up to Delville wood.  The 3rd Fld Amb. are looking after the Rest station here. had a good bath this evening, it was needed very much.</p>
<p>5 Tuesday<br/>Raining during the day, just about enough to make the ground muddy.  Detailed as clerk in the admittance tent.  There was nothing much to do after we got rid of a very big sick parade.  There were sounds as of a big bombardment on the right.  This place has been condemned &amp; has to be evacuated completely by Saturday next. Received 2 letters, the first to be addressed to this unit from Australia.</p>
<p>6 Wednesday<br/>Reveille goes at 6.30 here, but as all of us have been used to getting up at 8 am, we have never attended the 7 am parade this two mornings.  The 1st Fld is in charge of this place now.  Relieved about 10 am. packed up &amp; left here 1.30 pm for Ribemont about 2 kilometres away.  Both my heels are blistered &amp; it is a struggle to keep on walking.  My cold is getting very bad, hadn't much sleep during the night through coughing.</p>
