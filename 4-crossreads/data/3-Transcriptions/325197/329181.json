<p>merry party. Left Suez at 8-30pm.</p>
<p>Very funny at night some of the officers were well gone, otherwise three sheets in the wind, and they would insist on giving the boys a speech. It was as funny as a circus.</p>
<p>Sat 28th<br/>Tried to sleep on deck, but it was so windy that I was kept busy chasing my blanket all over the deck, so got down below.</p>

<p>Tues 7th Jan.<br/>Left Colombo at 6pm.</p>
<p>Thur. 9th Jan<br/>As the boys complained about the tucker yesterday we had a lecture from the O.C. Our complaint did a lot of good. Had Ham &amp; Eggs for breakfast this morning.</p>
