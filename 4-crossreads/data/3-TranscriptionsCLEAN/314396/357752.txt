Wednesday 25th Nov 1914.Land in sight at 6.15 Am. Came in to Aden &  dropped anchor at 7.30. Two larger promontories of nothing but rock to entrance. One on starboard side has 2 lighthouses &  about 3 signalling stations. No trees or grass &  no jetty or wharf. Travelled 295 miles. Natives came over to us from the shore selling tobacco, preserved fruit, post cards etc. Fired a blank off to frighten them away. A  S.M. threw some water over them &  nearly got thrown overboard for doing it. The place itself is placed near the shore &  behind are the big rocky mountains. A clock is placed on a hill in the town &  has only its [indecipherable]. Quite lonely it looks. It isn't lit up at night either. A very good search light is used by the garrison stationed there. Have a headache &  sore chest.
