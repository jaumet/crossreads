  
 25 July 1918 Thursday Another night march to  Deiran  not far from our old camp in the  Richon  days.   Now all the country is changed as the Vineyards are full of ripe grapes-   Melons Cucumbers everywhere-   In the distance we can hear Jaffa being shelled & enemy planes came & had a look at us. I am still in command of the Regiment but of course we are doing nothing & our C.O. is acting Brigadier.   My chief work now is to get my men mounted again & horses shod up   It was bad luck losing so many.   Oil engines are puffing away watering the Vineyards-
