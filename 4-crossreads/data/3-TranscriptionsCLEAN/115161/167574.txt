their heart for our name.
I visit other places and call on relations and friends, and after spending three days thus I returned to camp, wondering if that will be the last trip I shall make to the haunts of my boyhood days.
I remember on one occasion the orderly-sergeant was trying to find some fellows to detail for guard duty. I together with three other fellows had lately been on that wretched duty, so we decided to "break" camp and have a day in Salisbury. We arrived at a village named "Wylie" went on the station platform and bought the necessary tickets, the train was nearly due, when suddenly up came a "jack" and asked if we had "passes" we told him the truth that we had not, but that as we were going to France in a few days we wished to see Salisbury before we went. He told us to get back to the camp at once. So we handed our tickets back to the railway official and having received the cash for same, started on our way back to camp.
What was our surprise a few minutes later (on hearing a shout from behind us) to look around and find the military policeman coming after us. We met him, and he said, "You seem a decent lot of fellows, if you like you can go on to Salisbury, but dont get on the train from the paltform, come with me, and I will show you a good dodge." He took us over the railway bridge, we got over the fence, and boarded the train from the wrong side. The point was that if were were caught in Salisbury, we could truthfully state that we did not board the train from the Wylie platform. He was a decent "jack" and a bit of a sport too. We remembered him later, when an opportunity arrived.
I was not allowed to proceed to France on two occasions, the medical officer stating that I had not enough teeth, that I must have a few artificial ones. I went to the dentist, had two more drawn out, had no artificial ones put in, and was successfully "passed" as fit for the next draft for France. Strange, the doctor tells you one day that you can't go to France as you have not enough teeth, you have two more extracted and
