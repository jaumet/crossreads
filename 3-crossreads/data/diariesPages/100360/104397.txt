Thur. June 28th More stretcher drill & Waggon Loading. Breakfast was very young this morning. At 2 p.m. there was a special Parade & the Col. presented Maj. Bond with his D.S.O. ribbon, also presented ribbons to all who got the Military Medal. I was one of ‘em. That’s another x M.S. owes me.

Fri. June 29 Same old [indecipherable]. Stretcher Drill. For Dinner we had quite a good Feed. Steak & plenty of Beans & Cabbage. Posted Letter 23 to Lill & inclosed a piece of Ribbon.

Sat. June 30th Went to Henencourt & had a "try out" over the Course. The 14th & 15th were also there. On Sat.s. showing we stand a good chance of pulling off the prize. Let’s hope so, anyhow. Went to Anzac Show.

Sunday. July 1st Glory Alleluia! Out to Henencourt again. No Church Parade. A man will soon forget his prayers at this rate. After Dinner I picked an eleven to play Miles Sheean’s Team. It was most amusing. Alec Ewing made 30 runs & Dad Good – 50 – quite a surprise Miles & I were both put out for a "duck".
