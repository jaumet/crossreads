<p>[Extract from letters to the Editor, Egyptian Gazette]<br/>RED CROSS &amp; Y.M.C.A.</p>
<p>To the Editor, "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
<p>Sir, - Re Australian Red Cross versus Egyptian Y.M.C.A. controversy, I venture to say that most, if not all, Australians think as "Australian Woman" does, especially the wounded. I contend that we should never have had to depend on outside kindness for the supply of comforts, which our Red Cross Fund was intended to provide, &amp; well could.</p>
<p>I am, Sir,<br/>"A 2 months-bread-and jam-fed (up) Convalescent."</p>
<p>Alexandria, July 16.</p>
