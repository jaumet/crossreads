 5/1/18 London ? Penzanc The countri is look far greener than Franc . Had a quick run to Taunton and enjoy pretti sceneri through Somerset and Devon . The train tore along at a good speed and though veri smooth run , it gave me the usual nausea . About 6 p.m. pull into Penzanc and took a chariot to the Queen Hotel which is on the esplanad . A cold dark night with the tide dash in . The Hotel seem a good and comfort one and not too mani other peopl stay here . Dine well and notic no lack of food , wash the meal down with some excel claret . A few other diner all in dress cloth and most elder peopl . Did some write after dinner and then turn in earli lull to sleep by the wave dash up against the esplanad . Everyth is spotless and clean at this Queen Hotel .
