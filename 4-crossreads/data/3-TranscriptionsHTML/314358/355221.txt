<p>Tell my mother I never forget her</p>
<p>She is with me so often here, her splendid Hope and trust is mine, and worth more than all the commissions under the sun. "Rank is but the guinea stamp" &ndash; as Bobby Burns puts it.</p>
<p>Dont take my notes as finished writings for I have no time to write as I am able to.</p>
<p>Much love to you my wife and to our children and mother.</p>
<p>Not forgetting the others</p>
<p>Am glad mother has grand old Jack still at home.</p>
