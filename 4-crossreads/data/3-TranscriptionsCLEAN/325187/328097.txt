 We are allowed 30 lbs each Officer on the Carriers- this includes Blankets oil sheets, changes of clothes, writing material, Plum Puddings or any extra parcel, soap Towels Razors etc:- & & then as each & every camel is Lousey a good wash & change is essential. 24 hours in the Saddle & am now in Al Arish, Turks evacuated but we got a few prisoners I have a Turkish revolver. Having drawn 50/- to pay this man I had to carry it on me all the time, so just as well no fight.  I would have been down a good hand- We rode all night & surrounded the town at dawn but they had flown.  Two men blown to pieces by a mine on the Beach & other trip wires were found left by Turks to do us damage.
