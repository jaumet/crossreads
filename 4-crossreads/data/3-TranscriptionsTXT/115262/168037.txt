 On watering parade to the Waddi 6 miles out. Since my last visit, things have changed wonderfully. &quot;The line of communication&quot; is altogetlher improved in every way. Telegraph lines, entrenched roads etc. form a great change &amp; addition to the defences. There are now thousands of troops on the Waddi in expectation of the &quot;big push&quot; shortly. 
 Artillery covered by battle&nbsp; aero planes was seen moving out towards flank of  Beersheebah  Beersheba.&nbsp;
