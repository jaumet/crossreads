<p>October 1915<br/>artillery duels.  Wrote a letter to mother to catch the "Omrah" at Port Said.  It rained nearly all night, but our oil sheets turned most of it off.</p>
<p>Friday 22nd<br/>To day was very cold.  It is hard to know what to do to keep warm.  We have had 5 men go away sick this week from our squadron.  Got more rain this afternoon.</p>
<p>Saturday 23rd<br/>Fairly fine again.  Had the sun out for a few hours.  2 men who have been away sick came back Martin &amp; Charlesworth.  We got an issue of comforts bought from regimental funds.  Arundale was shot in the leg while emptying a bag of earth behind the trenches.</p>
<p>Sunday 24th<br/>We all got a drink of tea at stand-to this morning.  It was very acceptable  From 5 to 6 is a fairly long time to stand to without any refreshment.  We had some rain this morning, it was very cold.  Our machine gun got onto a few Turks this morning &amp; knocked a few.</p>
