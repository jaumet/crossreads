<p>interesting fatalistic story.</p>
<p><u>Entry</u> Saturday 18th Aug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In troops Train travelling from Rouen to Hazebrook on Belgian front. I am O.C. Train which consists of 50 trooptrucks &amp; carriages. Troops include English, Scotch, Welsh, Australians &amp; Indians. After a heavy shower of rain just before starting&nbsp; from Rouen at <u>3.30</u> the day is now delightful, the country beautiful after the rain.</p>
<p>I am given a compartment to myself but have Jock Willis (Lt 15th) with me. We have boots, coats &amp; collars off as it is rather warm. The Seine - a beautiful &amp; large stream looks well - quite crowded with small stream vessels &amp; barges.</p>
<p>We arrived in Rouen about 7 this morning, went to <s>a</s> barbers for wash &amp; shave, to Officers&#39; Club, but as they were extremely slow there getting breakfast, Willis &amp; myself went to a small restaurant &amp; enjoyed Coffee, bread, butter &amp; French Cheese. --</p>
