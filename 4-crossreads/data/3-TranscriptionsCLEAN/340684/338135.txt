The hardships they have to put up when the wind storms come along is awful all the tents get blown down and the nurses on and off duty have to work for hours getting the patients fixed up again. 
 My letters written in this place are really not worth sending - I have no interesting news - I have had letters again from Mrs Southall and Mrs Holman they are jolly kind people - I am looking forward to meeting them - 
 Fondest love to the Mater and yourself Hoping you are both well and cheerful Ever your  affectionate son Gibson
