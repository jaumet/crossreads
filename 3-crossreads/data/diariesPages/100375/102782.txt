Egypt, in fact, she was the last nurse that I had worked with before I left to go to Anzac. She had, had six boys working with her but none could agree with her perculiar manner. However, having worked with her previously, I pretty well understood her and I managed to get along with her very well indeed
Dec 24th.Working in Ward. Plenty of running about fixing things for the Xmas Celebrations
Dec 25th.Xmas Boxes issued to all, splendid breakfast.A sumptuous dinner was provided for the patients dinner.
The ward was very nicely decorated.
After our busy time fixing up the patients with their dinner, a thing that was no small job, the staff had theirs
It was a perfect feast of good things. We had:
Soup; Poultry, Bacon, Potatoes, Peas and Beans; Roast Pork Sauce; Plum Pudding Sauce; Custard Jelly;
On the table there was also Champagne, Beer, Aerated Waters, Sweets, Raisins, Dates and Almonds galore.
To be so near the firing line and to have so rich a feast was inconceivable to any one but those who were there. The cooks had been working for the last forty-eight hours continuously for the making of these dishes.
