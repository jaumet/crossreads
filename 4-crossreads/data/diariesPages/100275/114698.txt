All the Brigade men such as trench mortar machine gunners have gone into the trenches we follow them tomorrow so we will soon be in the thick of it again.
1st September. Cool cloudy this morning the country is drying fast you can't beat a fair wind to dry the mud. A lot of Tommies came into our camp last night they are taking the huts over from us we are going into the firing line sometime to day. Got off parade again this morning I had a few stiches that wanted mending in
