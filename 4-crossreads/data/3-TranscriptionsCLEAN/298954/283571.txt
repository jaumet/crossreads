 The calm which was such a feature of the last weeks has gone;  most of the prisoners are absolutely boiling with indignation at the slackness of the English patrols.    A pilot was believed to board us from a submarine at 6 pm. 
 Sun. 17th Feb. We are into German waters. 
 During the morning the signal was given to allow prisoners on deck and the heterogeneous collection of all ages and types, all colours and nationalities poured out of the holds to obtain their first glimpse of the "Land of Bondage (to quote Hall Caine and the Bible.)
