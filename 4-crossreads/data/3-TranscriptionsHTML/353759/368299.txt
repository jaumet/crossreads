<p>girl very nice. You comprenez?" and his expression told more than his words. He was drunk royally so, and he was lying perhaps but for all that I"m jolly glad the individual Indian doesn"t feel towards us the individual hatred he feels for the Tommy. Why it is I don"t know.</p>
<p>18.<br/>Roachie picked this book up yesterday &ndash; I"d left it alongside others on the Mess table. He read the title page:  Pte F H Molony.   8087 "---- Ge Frank you"re one of the "Fair dinkum".  It was the number that did it.  Roach on the ideal Australia &ndash; and the living essence of a Bacchante strip his perfectly developed slim body, crown him with vine leaves, let him continue with his usual manner and he"s the Antique Bacchante. He"s a cheerful liar, a gambler and a Don Juan, a summer muse and God knows what.  He"s the living incarnation of Sir Walter Raleigh. Really it was Roach who spread his cloak for the same Queen and he who wrote the English History.</p>
<p>19.  May 4 1916<br/>Yesterday Roach, Stott, Jefferson and self went for a swim behind breakwater round to left going into Marseille.  Costume &ndash; underpants and Roachie a handkerchief.  Roachie lost his 'costume" after second dive and didn"t worry to find it again.  We were fooling round &amp; swimming about 10 yds. out.  He"s leaning against wall of breakwater in water up to the knees, suddenly he looked up:  two girls were with their French soldiers standing above laughing at him:  Roachie laughed back:  and stayed there.  "There"s no moral modesty about these people is there!", he said.</p>
<p>20.<br/>Today at 9 Chadwick , McClaner, Roach and Morris paraded before O.C. re cut down monies &ndash; we went on reports &ndash; or rather unofficial report that Base detail had been fully paid.  The original idea was that we should all parade but red tape putrocities decided us against it.  My application of few days back in waste paper basket with this "informed by Sgt. Ramsford this morning.  Roachie expects his tenner this morning &ndash; if he does get it I"ll borrow a quid from him and call again.</p>
<p>21.<br/>While over at the P.O. for an "active service" envelope I saw a pile of papers for wounded.  I got out of it a Bulletin &ndash; March 2 addressed "A Lonely Soldier &ndash; as Bill"d say, "Well I bloody well was!"  God damn the war, there"s an exhibition of Low"s cartoons in at Anthony Horderns and I won"t be able to see them, let alone get any of them.</p>
<p>22.<br/>After lunch "Tommy" brought Scotty and self over a large plate of 'cutlets".  They"re made of Bully beef, bread, vinegar, onion, pepper, mustard and potato, and they"re fried or baked.  They"re absolutely delicious.  Yesterday while he was sober this time he told us of his shooting the 2 Cols. &amp; 2 Capts. and 1 Lieut, "it is my caste," "any man he insult me, well I kill him," says Tommy &ndash; and he told us the other day he was a Christian.  "Truth!"  Lucky he doesn"t dislike us, its quite evident though he"s taken an instant fancy to us.  I think its because we wouldn"t let him bring his dog "E-cri" about while he was drunk.</p>
<p>23.<br/>Swapped with Middleton, The Secret Woman for Merrick"s "All the world wondered", I reckon, features in one of yarns, he"s exquisite.</p>
