<p>"Birralee" Wolseley Road<br/>Point Piper, 29th Nov. 1916<br/>Dear Judge Ferguson,</p>
<p>I have just received from my son (Lieut. Harold Barlow) by last mail, two Photographs taken on board a Troopship on the way to Marseilles, my son &amp; your poor son being in the group; my boy has asked me to send these photographs to you as he thinks you would like them, being the latest Captain Ferguson had taken.</p>
<p>Harold tells me that he was sitting next to your poor boy, in the Dug-out, when he was killed (instantly) &amp; he was himself knocked out &amp; wounded by the same shell; he speaks very highly of his late C.C. &amp; says he was one of the best.</p>
