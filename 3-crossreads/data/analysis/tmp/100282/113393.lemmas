Tobacco is veri scare in Pari near all tobacconist have notic in their window to the effect that they are sold out , when they get a fresh suppli you ought to see the peopl line up in the street wait for their turn to buy how pleas they look when they come tumbl out with a coupl of packet of what the French call cigarett , our fellow would sooner go without than smoke them so you can guess what they are like , if you give a Frenchman an English cigarett 10 to 1 he will put it care away so that he can enjoy it on some special occass , it seem so funni to us see great crowd of peopl of both sex line up for tobacco . The train bus servic is veri good wonder cheap you can ride for mile mile for 1 penc .
