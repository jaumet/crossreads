<p>Bus to Trafalgar Square, after going to Peel House, &amp;  a walk around the Strand &amp; accompany Cunn. to his hotel, have a long chat &amp; a smoke &amp;  leave them to keep my appointment with Legge at 2 pm. Luckily meet him coming in a taxi with kits etc &amp; we all set off to Grosvenor gardens. He is staying here. Close by is Victoria Rly Stn. After a good lunch (rather late) take a bust past St Pauls to the Exchange corner. From here to Shepherd's Bush by Underground Railway &amp; here we have afternoon tea. There is no doubt of the popularity of Australians in London    &amp; my short experience shows me that opportunities to no extent are given us. After another ride past Piccadilly, St James Park, &amp; eventually we arrive back at the Strand, have dinner &amp; Legge leaves me. Meet another pal, one of the boys, with two girl friends &amp; together we take a walk round Hyde Park. I arrive at my diggings at 11 pm &amp; enjoy a good    &amp; well earned sleep.</p>
