<p>Our casualties in this Bellicourt "Stunt" were very light,  unfortunately one man made the supreme sacrifice - Pte. J. Williams of A. Section was killed, &amp; the following were wounded, L.Cpl. Hunt, M.M., Ptes. Stanton A. Watts E.R. (The M.M.) McGregor, W,. Griffiths W.A. Pte. Brown, Ridgway W. &amp; Hanning. The latest report of these chaps that they are on the way to recovery. Hunt &amp; Watts rejoined the Unit shortly afterwards. Our old friend Tom Ross was sent away to hospital, he accidently hurt his knee, on the night of the stunt.  The old hands are certainly disappearing from the ranks of the Unit,  it is not nice to see this.</p>
<p>7th October 1918.<br/>At last we started on the road to go right back for our "Dinkum Rest". The Unit paraded at 2 p.m. &amp; marched to Peronne, a fairly long march,  the distance was about 9 miles &amp; to make matters worse, a heavy thunder storm greeted us.   At 6 p.m. arrived at the Le Mesnil &amp; took shelter in old wooden huts, till mid night. A Y.M.C.A. was close handy, so I spent the time there.</p>
<p>8th October 1918 &ndash; 9th October 1919.<br/>At 12:30 a.m. we started on the road again for Peronne &amp; entrained in cattle trucks. The weather was rather "nippy", "believe me". The train actually got a move on at 5 a.m. &amp; disentrained at Oisement about mid-day.   The first two hours of the journey was through country that Fritz held before the start of the big advance,</p>
