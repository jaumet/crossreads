 Our chaps tell us from France that they live like fighting cocks there & die too & all arrangements in Commissariat, Line Canteens, Hot Baths etc are splendid, but that the Trenches are not as good as we made in Gallipoli. The English Paper shew many of the good ships that backed us up at Gallipoli, knocked out but from all accounts the Hun was kept from laughing- & honors are at least easy if not in our favour- Evening airplane flew over we fired a few shells & the Machine guns got busy, but by the time our Battle planes got here, the Turks had flown- good for nerves-
