<p>March, 1915<br/>Saturday 6<br/>You will think we are very gay &amp; perhaps not serious enough when I tell you that we all went to another Ball at Continental Hotel &ndash; Dinner &amp; danced till 4 A.m. being second night out without sleep &ndash; 1st in the trenches on the Desert, 2nd in electric lighted beautiful hall &ndash; but it all helps to keep a man fit, &amp; the scene is a gay one, nearly all soldiers &ndash; expensive also!!! Friday night we Marched 18 miles &amp; dug ourselves in  &amp; awaited Infantry attack at dawn got back to Camp 9 A.m.<br/>Received letters from Aunt Louie Jan 22 &amp; another from Laura Feb 19 &ndash; please thank them for me.</p>
