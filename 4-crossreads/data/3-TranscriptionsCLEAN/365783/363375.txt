Dearest old Mrs, I have been staying for the last few days at this hotel in Cairo - I was feeling a bit run down out at the Camp & got the Colonel's permission to have a few days loaf in Cairo.   I have been working pretty hard since we arrived at Mena & have had a lot of responsibility & I think it got on my nerves a bit - however I feel quite right again now and when I get back to the Camp I am going to take things a good bit easier.
