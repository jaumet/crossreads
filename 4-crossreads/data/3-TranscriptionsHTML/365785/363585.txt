<p>it is the only thing that keeps us sane in these dreadful days;  though it just breaks one's heart to see the marred &amp; maimed bodies, scores of boys with one leg or the arm gone, &amp; with a leg off on one side and an arm on the other and one poor fellow with just two little stumps both legs gone and yet they are a continual lesson in cheerfulness &amp; patience.<br/>I have only had one glimpse of Mer. since we parted on Board the Malina last April just for a few hours passing through Marseilles in June last; he has been due for leave since October but says with great luck he may get it by Xmas or New Year.  He has at last got his promotion &amp; is now elevated to rank of Major, is serving with the 4th Field Ambulance.<br/>How are the bairns?  Suppose Peter feels he's quite a big boy by now.<br/>Mr. Budden is over in France busy with Xmas presents for the Troops.  He returns to Aus., I think, in January &amp; Mr. Woodburn succeeds him as Commissioner I hear.</p>
