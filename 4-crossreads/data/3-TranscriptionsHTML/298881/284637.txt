<p>Wardreque 19/8/17<br/>Tonight we dined with our very excellent host, he having invited us all <strike>the t</strike> yesterday, being his custom to have all officers in to dine with him at least once <strike>once</strike> during their stay in the house &ndash; and it was some dinner.  Plenty to eat, plenty to drink.  White wind, red wine, lacure or coffee.  The omelette was bonze, the soup, boshter, the roast meat and potatoes simply glorious, but the pudding contained a little too much brandy to be really nice.  The cigars were the best I have every smoked and I slept like a top when I went to bed.</p>
