I went through the Hot houses, and saw some wonderful plants and flowers, they are well cared for.  After tea I went with Jean to Mrs Jim Young's place and saw her and the family, my uncle Jim died years ago, leaving 4 girls and 2 boys, after staying there for a little while Mrs Young took me to my father's brother's house and there saw my Uncles Robert & George (Dod).
