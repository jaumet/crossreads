He is a staunch friend &amp; though quite a boy has understood the misery of my outlook &amp; all through the dreadful time when Mothers last letters were reaching me has helped me with great understanding &amp; sympathy. At times when he found me fretting over my Darling's letters he would just take my arm &amp; walk me about for hours &amp; do all he possibly could to comfort me.</p>
