Wed July 11
The Lecture on "The Magneto" was continued this morning.
Went into Town after Tea with "Perce". It came on to rain, so we took shelter in a Bathing Tent. About 10 we looked into "Arcadia" where the usual Wed. night dance was on and I had the last waltz before going back to Camp.
Thur July 11th
Many happy returns B.E. Hope to the Lord I'm Home before her next.
The School Lecture was on Electricity Accumulators, etc. Dave and I and a couple of others are putting an engine together. It's very interesting but we waste a lot of time looking for the different parts. We fixed an oil engine to our car, so as to see the working of the Gears.
Wrote Letter No 30 to B.E.
Fri July 12
Lecture on Clutch and Gear Box. I take down copious notes on the Lectures, but I'm hanged if I can understand what I've written at times.
It is raining beautifully, and the Farmers are smiling once more. I did not go into Town after Tea, but stayed in Camp and looked over my gear. It's a week today since I had that yarn with O.P. and I'm beginning to wonder if anything will come of it.
Sat July 13
Lecture on Springs, Tyres, etc.
After Tea I went into Town but things were rather quiet. I've seen scores of chaps here that I know.
