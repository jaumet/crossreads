31/8/18 Herbecourt
strenuous resistance but I see a number of wounded passing here. Received orders to move at 11.30 am across the river by a small bridge constructed by the Engineers our transport passing through Feullieres. The other bus all moving on ahead. We are to concentrate in certain map squares across the river and just north of Peronne near Mont St Quentin Here this area has not yet been mopped clear of enemy and our 23rd Battalion is to do the mopping up here. Everyone is being prepared for the move. I gave the men a drink of tea from the cookers and sent Thewlis ahead with them and all the Transport to cross the river and pick us up over there. Our padre is impossible absolutely and always blows in at the most inconvenient
