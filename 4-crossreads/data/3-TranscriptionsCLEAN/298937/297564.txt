  
 Thursday 20th April 
 News in paper of fall of Trebizond & today I hear that America has declared war on Germany. If so things are indeed brighter. No letters yet. Hope to be on the way to France soon. Foot is - like I imagined for weeks - nearly better. 
 Friday & Sat. 
 Nothing happened to get excited about.
