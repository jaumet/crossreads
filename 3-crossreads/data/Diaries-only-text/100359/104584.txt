Saturday 22nd 
Slept in till about 10, then wrote to Lill. A few wounded continue to pass through, but things are becoming normal again. Everyone rushed to buy a paper this morning expecting to see a big account of the scrap, but all it had was just about 3 lines to say the "Anzacs" had taken part in a raid. It is hard to realise yet, what a small part we are of this huge army. We paid a visit to a shop kept by two young French women. They told us some very interesting yarns about the huns, when they were occupying this village. Bac St.Maur one of ?em the better looking of the two, said all the time the Germans were at their place she sat by the fire in her nightdress with a shawl over her head and made out she was sick. One day a German Officer came into the room and saw her, he said "you sick" "Oui Monsieur" said she, "no good to me then" said the Hun. There is no mock modesty about the French People, and they tell us things like this just as naturally as though they were speaking of the weather. I bought a pretty little silk apron and sent home to Lill. It was a good shop and one could get almost anything there.?
Sunday 23rd
Sent P.Cds to Cis, Nell, Kath, Arthur, and David. Yesterday we were paid. I drew 20f. Things getting quiet again. Mac and I went for a good long walk in the country. It is looking fine now. Buttercups and daisies growing among the long green grass, the beautiful big shady trees, and the birds singing merrily and yet only a short distance away are numbers of men still lying out there with their faces to the sky, killed by other men and neither party know the reason why. It is a glorious thing to listen to the tales of how our fellows leaped over the trenches to get at the Huns "legs in the air" go top of the Wazza" they sung out, and then away for their lives and into ?em.
