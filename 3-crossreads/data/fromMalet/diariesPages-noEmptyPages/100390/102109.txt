I hope so. I want a change of work. 
Im writing this lying in deep cool grass full of buttercups, around me the hedges full of hawthorn blooms and the blossoms of the apple tree falling over me. A thrush is piping his evening song and across the fields comes that most beautiful note of the cuckoo.
Over in the big barn where we live, alone clamours the raucous strident note of Australia, the voices of my comrades in arms wrangling over some petty thing or other.
And ever again deep undertone the roar of the German guns. At times like gigantic surf on some beach of iron
I send you my thanks and all my love 
Yours affectionately 
Jack
