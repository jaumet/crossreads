<p>26 Sunday<br/>Feeling terribly weak all day.  E.C. Brown called after lunch for a little while.  Then I went to Miss Wren for tea &amp; she took me out on heath.  We heard cuckoo.  Occasional glimpses of sun.  Very feeble.</p>
<p>27. Monday<br/>Went down to help at Minerva Caf&eacute;.  Home at 5 &amp; [indecipherable] had a snooze.  Feeling pitifully depressed.  Warmish day.</p>
<p>28. Tuesday<br/>Feeling terribly feeble &amp; depressed.  Cloudy, warmish day.  Shower in afternoon.  During afternoon called on Editors for Miss Newcomb.  In evening went to Gertrude Peppercorn's piano recital with A.A.S.</p>
<p>29. Wednesday<br/>Fine day.  Very feeble &ndash; want of food partly I think.  Lay down in forenoon  in afternoon did editors again for Miss Newcomb's conference.</p>
