<p>old Colonel has prohibited any more boxing or wrestling matches to be held.  The colonel (Col. H.V. King) is an old Australian bushman &amp; is a fine old man.  He hasn't much <strike>manner</strike> delivery about his speeches, but he is an old warrior &amp; is very well liked by the men.<br/>I have sometimes leaned over the rail at the stern of a night &amp; watched the phosphorescence in the water.  It is a lovely sight &amp; of course was quite a new &amp; novel one for me.<br/>We have had extremely hot weather for the last week or so &amp; everyone is appearing in the lightest of dresses.<br/>The Orsova is a lovely vessel &amp; a splendid sea boat   We were indeed lucky to be appointed to her.  We have now been 10 days out of sight of land &amp; have only seen 2 steamers during that time.  We have just sighted on starboard bow a smoke which is probably that of a transport that left Freemantle 2 days ahead of us.<br/>Two or 3 days ago I, in company with another chap who knows one of the engineers, went down the engine room &amp; was shown all over the engines (twin screw) dynamos, board, &amp; propellors.  It is truly a magnificent piece of machinery, &amp; kept in splendid order.<br/>The meals have been splendid so far &amp; I have always been ready for my tucker.  The supply of fresh<br/>water is running out &amp; we are on condensed water now which is not half as nice as the fresh.</p>
