<p>Fairly quiet going out and got on job and started filling sandbags.  M.G. very lively from two directions all night.  Saw Roberts going out &amp; M.G. very close just outside battalion.  Had to retire to dugout several times as shelling pretty heavy.  I filled a few bags &amp; spent rest of evening fixing on wire for camouflage &amp; at about 1.30 started to cover up.  Unloaded both pontoons although very hot once &amp; had to volunteer to leave dugout.  Robb had wind up badly while camouflaging &amp; then had to run to trench and Sarre &amp; Linton stayed behind &amp; still warm.  Got down safely to Vieux Berquin Road and more shelling there &amp; had to wait.  Then home more quietly to bed very tired.  10th successful raid of 500 yds.</p>
<p>29.6.18<br/>Heavy bombardment early in morning and continued to dinner time.  Also again in even.  Didn't get up till after dinner &amp; cleaned up.  To go out with Sarre at 9.30.  Got party of 15 men from 11th &amp; rest of party went on with Edmonds.  Also Groth out &amp; lost party for awhile  Quiet night &amp; some very close M.G. bullets.  Put in two dugouts and filled in and rest did a little gentle digging.  Left at 12.30 &amp; home quietly.  Fine.</p>
<p>30.6.18<br/>Stayed in bed till 12 without dinner &amp; read Pelman &amp; practised it.  Continued in afternoon.  Out at 9 with Appleton and on same job with Sarre on a new one.  Parties late as usual &amp; got 18 men who didn't have any definite orders.  On to job</p>
