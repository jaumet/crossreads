 I thought it was very fine, perhaps you have seen it. 
 The cuttings were more than welcome, and all the lads round about me have had a great old time as well as myself, reading them. 
 I have noted your few remarks  about Cairo, but don't be troubled, Father. I don't  not  profess to have one hundredth the knowledge, you &amp; many others have, but as you know, I have knocked round a fair bit, during the last few years, and are fully aware of the snares awaiting one, if he is not very careful &amp; level-headed, &amp; though I do not pretend to be perfect, you can be assured I shall always try my very best to do the manly thing. &ndash; I can't say more. 
 I have been a very long time over this letter, &amp; if it does read a bit disjointed, remember that I am not quite myself today, &amp; cannot help thinking of my not being in with the boys when they strike "trouble", probably in a few days. 
 I have not had a letter from Mother or Dene or Hazel yet. Ask them to write, you cannot imagine how we look forward to mail day here. Its almost the only bright spot in this awful place. 
 Give my very best Love to all the family &amp; don't worry. I'll be alright soon now 
 Your loving Son Alan
