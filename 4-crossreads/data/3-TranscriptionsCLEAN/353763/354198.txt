  
 I saw also the bud & of the Custard Apple - Anonaceous fruit but the fruit here in my opinion is the luscious papua Grenadillas I saw but not the common Passion fruit so far although P.foetida grows here like a weed just as in N.Qd - on the Cairns to Mareeba line  -  Crotons here are glorious & I've mentioned Acalyphas while the leaves of Ricinus Commis are double & treble the ordinary size  -  This latter shrub was evidently being well tried in these grounds  - 
 We walked on  -  I noticed little Lycenid blues & now and again a member of the Nymphalid group like to my old Q-land friend  -  I've not seen the Wanderer nor his food plants  -  Kingfishers seem fairly plentiful & I fancy some honeyeaters are here  -  I'd almost swear to the call of the Leatherhead  -  I saw some big Swifts in high heaven - also a big bat & a bigger flying fox  -  How all this interests one in this new land of ours  -  I could spend months
