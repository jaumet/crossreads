<p>7. p.m.  &amp; we shall go to Cairo for dinner. I'm off this afternoon. Every forth day I get off from 2. p.m.  We have long hours but they fly.<br/>Sister Weisse (from Oakleigh) came with the Imperial Sisters a few days after us. She has been away from Melb. nearly 5 years. Last night she invited me to dinner (8.30. p.m.) with her at The Heliopolis House Hotel (opposite here) &amp; we had a glorious time. She has gone to Alexandria to-day. She belongs to the 21st Unit (Imperial) so goes to hospital there. We are well looked after by our men. Motor transport cars to always take us if they are going our way &amp; have room. I have meet a number of Officers &amp; some are out-patients, have lots of invitations to dinner etc but never go by myself always get a pal.<br/>Last night after dinner about 10. p.m. motored out to Abbassia (not sure of spelling) where Sister Weisse was nursing, about 3 miles from here, left her there &amp; then back to Palace. We always get permission</p>
