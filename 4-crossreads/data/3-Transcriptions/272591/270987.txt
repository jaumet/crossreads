<p>Holborn Viaduct Stn. After leaving Bank went down King William St to the Monument, but did not ascend it. Then went up Gracechurch St, Bishopgate &amp; High St to Shoreditch Stn passing on way Liverpool St Stn. Then went down Old St, Clerkenwell Rd, Theobalds Rd, Hart St, Great Andrew St, &amp; St Martins Lane to Trafalgar Sq. On way saw an old landmark called St Johns Gate &amp; in Hart St saw a house where the Earls of Chesterfield lived in 17th century. From Trafalgar Sq. I went along the Mall, passing hundreds of captured German guns, Buckingham Palace &amp; Road to Victoria St &amp; then to Anzac Buffet for tea. Altogether must have walked 6&frac12; miles. During my wanderings also passed Saint Bartholomews Hospital, St Lukes Hospital &amp; 2 or 3 old churches. After tea at the Buffet met Bruce Hutton again so we went to the YMCA in Tothill St to a Social &amp; stopped there till 9.30 pm, after which I went home, arriving about 10 pm.</p>

Went to Anzac Buffet for dinner then</p>
