Saturday November 11th
My poor old Diary has reached its last pages. Many a time I have been going to give it up, but now its full I am very pleased I stuck to it. I only hope it gets safely Home to M.S. for whom it is specially written. The dear old 8th have had some good and a few bad times, but this last few days has seen the worst time we have had. Our last 16 days on "The Somme" was an awful time, but we were very lucky in only getting one man wounded. I hope the Lord is as good to us when we "go in" again. This book has been with me every where and feels quite like an old friend, and I shall be quite sorry to part with it. If it reaches you in safety M.S. please take care of it, as it will be very pleasant, when I return to explain to you the parts of it, that you do not understand "Au revoir" old Book. I'm sorry to part with you, but hope to soon renew your acquaintance in dear old "Sunny Australia.
