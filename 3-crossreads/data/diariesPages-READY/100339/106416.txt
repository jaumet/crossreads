July, August, September 1919
out for pure enjoyment was when the Peace Celebrations were on in Sydney.

All or most of the Public buildings & business places were lit up with electricity & they looked lovely. The Water & Sewerage buildings were in my opinion the best effect. All the Flags of the Allies was the design, & they were all lit with their natural colors.

During my Leave I bought a Camera & got a good deal of amusement out of Photographing people & objects.

On September 2nd I started work at the Painting trade with Wintle & Wintle Contractors of Mosman Bay. This is the first work I was able to get since the termination of my leave on July 30th. Just at that time work was very scarce about Sydney & there were thousands of Returned Soldiers on the unemployed list at the Repatriation Department. The Repatriation Department procured this job for me. I was just about one week on their roll & drew sustenance pay to the value of Â£500.

The end
