  
 hurt talk about luck. 
 The reason for all this activity is pretty plain, there is going to be a raid by the 7th Batt. tomorrow night things are promising for a lively night. 
 Just at tea time the Captain came rushing in & ordered us all to get out of the line as soon as possible for there was going to be a very heavy bombardment at 5'oclock, so out we all trooped to the 2nd line & waited for it, she came alright & our guns & mortars crashed & roared & raged for full 30 minutes but the enemy contrary to expectations never replied so after the storm was past back we went. 
 The weather is holding fine & the days are quite nice, I can hear the guns on the Somme real plain to-day
