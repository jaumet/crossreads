Just as I arrived at St Pancras a train load of British prisoners arrived from Germany they received a great reception. Some Sheffield gentlemen travelled with me from Leeds to Sheffield they were explaining all about the Sheffield works to me. For miles it is all munition factories in that district. In Sheffield saw where Zeppelins had dropped bombs. Midland railway carriages are very comfortable ? I think about the best over here. Nice fine day. When going down to station at Barrow, saw the cruiser Amethyst in dock for repairs.
