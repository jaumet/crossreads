<p>cultivation &amp; it is nearly impossible to do any work without spoiling something or other, but such is the fortune of war.<br/>They are getting our band together again so we will be alright for route marche's the 3rd Battalion have theirs going already, I heard it early this morning &amp; very nice it sounded in the crisp air.<br/>Yesterday afternoon while we were practicing rapid loading with live ammunition, a chap in our section accidentally let his rifle off but luckily no-one was hit, the same chap also stuck his bayonet in his leg pretty deep, which made the blood flow pretty fast, a stab from a bayonet is a pretty painful thing as I can testify for I done the same thing myself at Mena when we were there.</p>
