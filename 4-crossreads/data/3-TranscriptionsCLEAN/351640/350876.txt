he and Willie Watson are both soldiers of the first order.   Sorry about Jarret, he was a peculiar sort.  I hope that the Bacon boys are still safe and sound, it is a little too much to expect for those who have been at Galipoli, as it has been a very hot corner during the visit of the Australians, you will all have conclude thus much before now.  My regards to Mrs. Bacon and Mrs. Franki when you meet them.
Kitty dear: Your letter bears no date but it was written I judge sometime about the end of April, it has a blot for the name at the termination, that because you were in a hurry no doubt.   I had a short note from Mrs. Begg of Waverley, I was sorry for her son, he was a nice lad
Father O'Reilley the new rector of St. Johns.    Cannot say that I am pleased, it might have been better to introduce some new blood of a high class.   Mr. Flowers to be President of the Legislative Council, he will do all right, I did not think of Jack Fitzgerald as the new vicepresident, he is a competent man of independent means and thinking powers, I should like to be in the chamber with him, he is not as heavy as Flowers, yet for an Irishman he h[a]s not a huge sense of humour, a valuable asset at times, but not so at others, I expected that Mr. Travers would have been given the position.
A letter from Mr. Watkins told me about the accident to the Melbourne express, he with others had narrow escapes, it is time that some one of the railway men was made an example of, they have been too much shielded.   I have replied to the letter from Mother Mary Bertrand.  You were quite amongst the soldiers at the camp with the Watt girls.   Just fancy a nun missing my weekly letter, I never expected so much honour.  I can just imagine Our Annie calling -  "Dinner girls, din[ner] Dinner.   Come quickly or the food will be cold.   And then when you did not come at once her calling in a louder voice."   How did you enjoy your stay at Cessnock?   It is rather a picturesque country town? it was not many years back small village, but the presence of black diamons [diamonds] has made it grow rapidly in to a large place and prosperous too.
Wounded men of various kinds are still daily pouring into Egypt from the Dardenells, men from here are not so keen to go there these days.   Can one blame them, though when they get to the firing line they will do as well as those who have gone previously, I never had doubt as to their fighting capacity, even the little Hyman will admit it by now.  A man just back from Galipoli told me that a British staff officer said "These Australians are great fighters and terrible swearers."
