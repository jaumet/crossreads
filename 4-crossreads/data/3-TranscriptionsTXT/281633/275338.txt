I don't know how the concert got on because I had to look after the lighting unit.  The Engine was "Tres Malade" &amp; gave me an anxious time.  Ditto every night until the
28.10Had a look over the Weaving Factory at Flixecourt today.  Seen them making carpets of all kinds, some kinds of Braid &amp; Jute, Canvas, Calico etc. (Saint Freres).  I had a tooth stopped yesterday after two temporary fillings.  The Dentist had about a company waiting for his attentions.  He gave me a rather painful Quarter of an hour.

31.10The Engine has been getting overhauled and altered ever since I came on it with the result that I have to learn over again the possies for the best mixture, speed control, &amp; Timing.  In addition I struck a new trouble last night.  The Engine flywheel is 3'3" in Dia. &amp; the Dynamo Pulley is 7" in Dia.  The distance between pulley centres is 24'.  At just the right speed for the Engine the Belt develops a lateral swing &amp; plays hell generally.  At any other speed the Engine will stop after about 10 min.
1.11Visited the Bat. yesterday.  Although they have been out for nearly a month &amp; have received a number of Gassed &amp; wounded men back, their Parade state is only 422 now.  No. 1 Platoon A Coy. draws rations for 12 men.  While at Villers-Brettonaux the full strength of A Coy. on a working Party one night was 14 this number on later nights was gradually increased to 27.  They only went out on alternate nights about this time.
2.11One can get some surprising results by calling one of the Gordon Highlanders "The Kaisers Bodygaurd".
