14/6/17 Paris
be quite glad to get back to work even after so short a rest. Virgil's plea to town lovers to come to earth and enjoy the life of the honest husbandman should be well applied to both Paris and London now too. After a good rest packed everything up ready for a quick get away and paid the bill and dished out heavy tips. Made for the Cafe de la Pain and dined well with some Haut Sauterne. A gay sight is this chicest cafe in Paris and some beautiful women came in and out. Plenty of glad eye ? indeed it is pathetic to see these poor brainless little beauties trying to "catch" a dinner. Walking in and out and lingering as long as they dare only perhaps to have no success in the end. One hears all languages guttural Teutonic and Slavonic on one side and the universal French on the other. Went back to hotel at 9.15 and met E. at 9.30 in the Writing Room and we took our leave on the balcony there. At 10.30 pushed off in a taxi and got a good seat in the Amiens train which left at 11.40 pm.
