<p>Camels on the Right of us<br/>Camels all around us- from Tawny Blacks to light fawns, this is the Camel Corps of enemy 1000s &amp; our horses are more accustomed to them now.<br/>On the Desert, they blend into a perfect protective color &amp; when lying down are hard to see on the march so much daylight shows under them they look all legs like a centipede.  Some are savage, but most of them were broken in.  At night their legs are tied like a sheeps &amp; then on to a ring in the ground "Tiboui" or "Barley" straw or Maize is just put in a shallow basin hollowed out in the sand.</p>
