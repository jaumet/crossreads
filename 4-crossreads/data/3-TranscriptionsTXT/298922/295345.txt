[The following sentence crossed through]  I send you with this a letter from Major Irwin written from Hos - gives an idea of what he did. Sorry love I tore it. Jim Ayre came & had a long yarn last night hope you can read this can hardly see for a septic gland swelling Face up but soon all right it is the continual TIN stuff & no vegetables I suppose. Old Camping areas, etc. etc. [The following sentence crossed through] Jim Ayre tells me Mrs. McFarland is an Anti conscriptionist & voted NO & some of her sons have volunteered.!!!
We have many Natives from Egypt building Barb wire & entrenching, but unless they can see one of our planes in the air they down tools & run away very afraid of bombs.
