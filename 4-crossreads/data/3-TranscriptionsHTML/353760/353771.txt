<p>The Guest, J. Drinkwater</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel that death is very near,<br/>And, with half lifted hand,<br/>Looks in my eyes, and tells me not to fear,<br/>But walk his friendly land,<br/>Comrade with him, and, wise<br/>As peace is wise.</p>
<p>Then, gently though my heart with pity moves,<br/>For dear imperilled loves,<br/>I somehow know<br/>That death is friendly so,<br/>A comfortable spirit:  one who takes<br/>Long thought for all our sakes.</p>
<p>I wonder:  will he come that friendly way<br/>That guest, or roughly in the appointed day,<br/>And will, when the last drops of life are spent,<br/>My soul be torn from me,<br/>Or, like a ship truly and timely built,<br/>Slip quietly to sea?</p>
