  
 up for supper, & then more sleep;  lazy boy! 
 July 11.   About ten of us missed our breakfast this morning as a result of oversleeping ourselves by an hour, and rising at 9 instead of 8.   Alan  & I warmed a tin of sausages for ourselves, instead, and did the mysterious concoction full justice.  I think that these sausages would be very nice for our next Como picnic.   We salvaged wire in the evening. 
 July 12.   Early shift again;  wire salvage.   In afternoon we visited the canteen in Pozieres & our booty included Pineapple conserve, biscuits, jam & Custard.   Alan made a dixie-full of custard when we returned.  He also made the jelly which was sent to me from Australia. 
 July 13.   I was detailed as mess orderly
