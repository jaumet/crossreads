business affairs till near midnight.
25th July
Morning sorting out Shackleton's negatives for slides. Afternoon at Will Days establishment. Day is one of the Cinema pioneers extremely interesting, and more so, as he has a fine collection of machines of deep historical interest which show the development of the Cinema and moving pictures from the first stages up till today. 
I left with him to dispose of for me, 1 Pathe Camera with 6 boxes in all, a turntable tilting top and stand). Signed contract with Shackleton which gives me the entire Australasian rights of the film and "stills'. 
Night at Mawson's flat sorting out slides for his lecture. An endless job finished at is midnight.
