17.9.16casualties, we can hear no news of the Camel Corps who were to attack from the rear & it asserted they were not in the fight; The 2nd & 3rd Bde came back at 3 oclock bringing 19 or 20 prisoners with them these were captured while out on patrol & look fine, strong, healthy young men & were all wearing very good uniforms;  We acted as rear guard back to Bir-El-Salmana, where we watered; the 2nd & 3rd Brigades camped here & we pushed on back to Bir-El-Abd arriving here at 10 oclock after a rather trying day as it was very hot & our water soon disappeared.  a few drank the well water at Bir Salmana, but I did not care to take the risk of Cholera.
