<p>1916 &nbsp; MONDAY 24 &nbsp; JULY</p>
<p>Fine but dull. We got away from camp about 8.45 &amp; marched to Amesbury &amp; got a special train for Warterloo. We got there about 12.30 &amp; marched to the Australian Military Offices in Horseferry Road. After fooling about there for a bit we were dismissed and I got a taxi &amp; came straight to the Goring Hotel&nbsp; Mother was waiting for me &amp; it was good to see her again. Alan came in later in his uniform. Both look very well&nbsp; We went round the town a bit &amp; saw Jack Bridges &amp; Uncle Bertie (who is to be married tomorrow) Auntie Florence, M<sup>rs</sup>&nbsp;Angus, Miss Robertson Mother Alan &amp; I went to see M<sup>r</sup>&nbsp;Manhattan at Prince of Wales Theatre. It was not much good. Had supper at the Savoy after &amp; went down into the dancing hall after.</p>
