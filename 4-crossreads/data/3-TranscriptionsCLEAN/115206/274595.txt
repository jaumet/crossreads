 At Beutin I must report on this village. Beutin Pas De Calais, to use the full title, is a small village 6 kilos East of Etaples. The village public buildings are four Estaminets, one church, and the Railway Station. There is a school, a bureax de postes, and the Gendarme National's residence. There is no other place of mention save the farmhouses which are typical to the other farms. Usual routine, and game of billiards. Today I won for a change.
