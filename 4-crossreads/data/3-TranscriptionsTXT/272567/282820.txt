 9/12/18 Paris - Caudry Awoke at 7 and shaved. Paid bill and taxied to Gare du Nord. Took a walk round the streets here before finally taking seat. Had an uneventful and quick journey to Amiens. Left Paris 9.30 &ndash; Arrived Amiens at 11.30. Went straight to consigne dumped bag and then up to Hotel de la Paix for a bite of lunch. Met a Major of the RAF who gave me a lift to Peronne in his car &ndash; a quick ride. There caught at once a motor lorry or bus and had a dreadfully jolty ride to Caudry which we reached at 6.30 about 80-100 miles by road. The journey from Paris to Caudry just about a record I think! Saw Town Major, got a billet, bought some food from GFC and had hot tea and hot food at church. Many old soldiers. Turned into bed with a subaltern of the 4th Divisional Artillery.
