Others have sunk their pride and have descended into the valley again to make terms with those who they lately looked down upon. Many thus have a working arrangement which answers very well. When the shells are coming from Achi Baba they invite those in the valley up to Sea View and when they are coming from Asis they themselves descend to the valley and live with their friends. But here again the unhappy inhabitants of Lancashire Landing are often checkmated by the Huns firing both from Asia and Achi Baba at the same time.</p>
