  
 She is a nice person. Her brother is in the 1st Regt and is now flying here. The films also arrived safely thank you. Am afraid this letter is very untidy but my pen went dry and now I'm using just a stump of a pencil. I hope you wont go and think I'm sick because I'm in hospital. If I was at home and felt lie I do now I think I'd go digging out rabbit burrows or something equally hard so that shows you how bad I am. Of course I'm a bit thin, but weigh some where about 11 stone 10 lbs and expect to go some where about 14 stone when I leave land of milk & honey and get on to the cream and honey at home. Gee that'll be fine I'll try and send you a cable if I find out what's doing at any time. Guess it will be a dinkum Christmas this year alright. Love to Hal and Fred and yourselves. 
 I am 
 Your loving son
