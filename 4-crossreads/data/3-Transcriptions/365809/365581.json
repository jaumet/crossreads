<p>My dear Judge.<br/>I arrived back with the Bn last Sunday week to find that they had just completed a show in which they had done extremely well and yet there was a great gloom thrown over the Bn by the loss of  some excellent officers and then on the Monday morning we got news that the Colonel had gone out. It was dreadfully hard to take . He was worshipped by everyone who had the pleasure of working for him and had, I think few equals in the AIF as a soldier . He had a great future before him as well as a splendid record behind him and as is so often the case it was just purely a matter of bad luck that he was hit. The Bn is now commanded by Lt Col S. Son of the recently retired Cf in Equity an excellent fellow who has been with the Bn since its formation &ndash; will do well. He and I work splendidly together. We have had some days rest</p>
