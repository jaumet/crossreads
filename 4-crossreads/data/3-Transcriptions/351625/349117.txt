<p>11th July</p>
<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>As you see we have reached Durban after being nearly a month on the trip.  We came in on the 9th but I don't think we will be staying more than about 3 days.  We had leave from 2 o'clock yesterday till 9.30 and have the same again today.  Durban is a nice city but not very large and of course it is over-run with the black population.  Today we had our dinner supplied to us by different societies.  At the place we are writing this we can get a good meal for about 4d. a plate of fruit salad costs 1d. tea 1d. plate of <strike>sandwiches 1d.</strike> salad 1d. sandwiches 1d.  These are the prices they charge.  There are also a number of free houses where soldiers and sailors don't have to pay anything so you can see we are very well treated at Durban.  Trains are free to all soldiers.  We had a ride in a rickshaw yesterday.  This afternoon we are going to the Zoo.  There are a great number of Tommies here.  They wear a uniform with short trousers and seem a very nice lot of fellows.  The Australians are behaving themselves splendidly which is due to the fact that drink is not allowed them and they are therefore sober.  The niggers here are very funny, the way they do themselves up with great head dresses with horns sticking out each side of their heads.  These are the fellows that pull the rickshaws.  I have written a good deal of my long letter in lead pencil so hope it will not rub out.  The weather here is splendid, quite warm, though it is the middle of winter.  There are some very nice buildings here but for size they don't anywhere near come up to Sydney.  This is only a scratch letter but we want to get out and see as much of the place as possible.</p>
<p>Love and kisses to all and plenty for yourself.</p>
<p>I remain,<br/>Your loving son<br/>Douglas</p>
<p>Letter No. 3</p>
<p>Dear Mother,</p>
<p>We are at sea again now, we left Durban on Thursday after spending 3 days there and were disappointed at not staying longer as we expected to be there about 10 days.  Durban has a nice harbour but not very large and it was choked full of shipping.  A hospital ship came in the same day as we did.  I think it was bound for Australia with returned men.  We expect to reach Capetown today or tomorrow but don't think we will get leave or at any rate we have been told not to expect it.  At Durban we had free meals and free trains and were told we were welcome to Durban but the people won't have anything to do with the Australian soldier and shunned him altogether.  I think it is the fault of those that have gone before, they must have played up terribly as the people as a whole looked on us as criminals and don't mind showing their dislike in a great many cases.  I had intended buying a lot of little knick-knacks there and sending them to you but we were hurried off so soon I did not have time.  Everything is very expensive there except tobacco which is cheap, other things seem dearer than Sydney.  It is raining on board today so we all have to keep below and the church parade is cancelled.  If we do not stay long in Capetown we will make a pretty quick trip to England.  We have had meningitis on board and had about 4 deaths from it but I think it is well in hand now as there have been no more cases for several days.  We have not had any cases in our company at all for which we are jolly thankful as they don't often save them.  To combat it every man has his throat sprayed once or twice daily and particular attention is paid to men with sore throats.  In Durban there were a great</p>
