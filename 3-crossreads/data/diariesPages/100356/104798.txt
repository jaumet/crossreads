Evacuation of Helles
Revielle at 6.30
All the men went out for a mounted parade again this morning, the horses are exceptionally fit. The news came through the the complete evacuation of Gallipoli was effected with huge success, they got off as well as we only losing 4 old guns 2 casualties the French got off as well, assisted by their Navy we were able to get all our mule transport away also, so that alone speaks volumes. Things up Salonica way are not too bright at the present but should take a different light when more of our troops make their appearance. Went down the street after tea Gilberg came with, we ragged all the restaurants to some tune until kicked out by the Picquets, got home in time to see a brawl in the second regt which finished up in our mess-room. Bed at 11 pm.
