<p>7 September, Sunday</p>
<p>Spend Day at Dee Why cleaning etc. cook dinner in open. Come Home, chop wood &amp; write at night. Too much energy which I work off.</p>

<p>8 September, Monday</p>
<p>Felling fittest yet, very cold day. Go for moonlight walk to tram, bail up several for pennies to get home. All in bed at Pet 1601.</p>
