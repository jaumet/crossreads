<p>1917<br/>Sun. 17th June<br/>The "Winslow" circled the "Wolf" during the bombardment &ndash; a pretty sight under full sail in the choppy sea.</p>
<p>We left the floating wreckage &amp; proceeded back to the Island to strip the "Winslow" of her cargo.</p>
<p>Mon. 18th.<br/>I was called up this morning &amp; questioned by "Little Willie" &amp; the Commandant's Secretary as to the call-letters of Union Company's ships.<br/>Of course, I "knew nothing", so William decided that frankness was the better thing.  He showed me an S.O.S. message intercepted this morning from what the German operator decided was the "Waitoutar".    It was, of course, the "Waitotara", she was burnt last night.</p>
<p>The two messages were<br/>12.    Copra on fire.<br/>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving ship.</p>
