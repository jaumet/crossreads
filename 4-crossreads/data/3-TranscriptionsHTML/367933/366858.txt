<p>Just a line to acknowledge receipt of "gift" stuff that arrived a few days ago and which included shirts socks and veils. The shirts and socks are a very welcome present but the veils are not now in quite so much demand as the worst of the summer is over and the flies are not so troublesome. We have been doing rather well of late for gifts from your way and everybody connected with the 1st are well</p>
