<p>[Saturday 16 September 1916]</p>
<p>Mr &amp; Mrs Neill came today to the Hospital to see me.  I leave at noon with Dolly for St Anns-on-Sea.  Charlie's wife meets us at the train.  I am better &amp; it is warmer.  Charlie's wife is a dear little fair girl with blue eyes same size as Dolly &amp; you Mother.  We had lunch &amp; I arrived here at St Annes on Sea at 9 pm.<br/>No one met us as Dolly made a mistake in the day she telegraphed anyway Father is not in favour of War weddings so don't know what will happen yet.</p>
