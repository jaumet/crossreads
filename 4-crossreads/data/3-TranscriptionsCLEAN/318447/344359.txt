  
 But here on my arrival yesterday I discovered that my wanderings are not yet over, they have made a clearing station at Railhead & I have to go over there in charge of the riding personnel. 
 I shall be glad when I get settled down. 
 Meanwhile the war is still going on. As usual I completely forgot all about my birthday until it was over, this makes the fourth birthday which I have not celebrated in this country.
