<p>October 1918.<br/>Wednesday 16</p>
<p>Bty position and advance ditto.<br/>Wet wet all day. Cooked for boys, captured a few rabbits. Had a little shooting with my automatic Fritzer &ndash; pretty accurate. <br/>Laid out l. of fire and two O.M. lines, also Bdge, Must have walked kilos. Fritz put a 4.2 on the dugout wall. Not feeling very well.  Had a little gas.<br/>At 18.30 Bty moved forward to a forward position near the line, don't like the line of dugouts. Stunt comes off in the morning &ndash; Good luck.</p>
