We are moving tomorrow up near Ypres, but we will be well protected the Skipper tells us, in bomb proof shelters. We will be camped in a pig stye & we lads in a cowshed - sounds interesting. 11-10-17 Moved to-day to H15 C58 (Sheet 28) in a fortified farmhouse & we are camping in a pig stye which has been cleaned out & sand bags arranged 3 deep up the sides & on the ceiling. It is black as night all day a very cheery place. 17-10-17 Still at the old farm. Fritz comes over every night dropping bombs. Some of them delightfully close but so far have caused no casualties.
