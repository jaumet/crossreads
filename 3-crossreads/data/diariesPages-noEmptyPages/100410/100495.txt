moving about that we will not fully realise our loss till it is over and we meet at our own homes once more. I do not know wether you understand our feelings, you must not think that we are calous, at present I can see Queenie now singing "we don't want to lose you" at the Hall in Queen St Woollahra. We don't forget although we will not give way to our feelings, if we did you would not like it, You say that your front is looking over the Harbour the back over Bondi Beach, well Lillian I can picture the whole scene but am content please God we will see it someday. You need never worry about your little band of swastikas, although they have not won V.Cs. etc it is not because they do not deserve them. I can truthfully say they not one ever shirked his duty, and at the present time, are all wishing to be back into the fray again. Lillian you can take all the credit yourself of that little emblem, you cannot realise what it has done none of us would have ever left the Bn only that we were compelled to, through serious illness or wounds Leo was unconscious when I had him in the first aid
