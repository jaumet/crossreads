London
12/9/16 After breakfast went down to Piccadilly by tube and from there on to St James Palace and watched the ceremony of guard mounting carried out. Great deal of frill but I am still satisfied my battalion could turn out smarter men at drill and rifle work - but then we cannot compare the pre-war Guards with the men in them now.  Lunched back at hotel and then went to the Scala theatre to see the Somme pictures most of which was "tripe" but one reel got fairly close to fact when it showed the dead lying about.  Went up Fleet Street and had dinner of pigeon pie, toasted cheese and a pint of bitter at "Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese" and came away feeling very full.  Old fashioned waiters like old John Bulls.  Little benches, oak partitions, and candles for light. The down the Strand through Leicester Square dodging the joy girls and to Her Majesty's and saw "Chin chin choir".  They don't play the National Anthem at the end of the show. The stone used in the buildings of importance here has the peculiar property of going white with age.  Westminster Abbey is a dark dull building but portions have gone quite white & and appear snow covered.  This is more marked in the case of St Pauls where the whiteness shows up very strongly against the dark portions.  Standing in Fleet St. one gets  a splendid view of the old cathedral dominating the whole street and showing hazily through smoke and mist.  Hoare and Co's bank is a dingy venerable place.  Passed Downing St again and saw the poky residences of the Premier & Treasurer.  Called at L/O for letters.  Plenty of  beadles & so on around Threadneedle Street and clerks wearing ordinary sac suits & bell toppers.  The Exchange is going white too.  Its text above the entrance seems out of place "The Earth is the Lord's & the fullness thereof".
