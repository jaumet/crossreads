28 July 1915Wednesday 50 wks of soldiering
The ruse proved most successful they blazed away for two hours along our whole front & joined a little artillery in it as well, we gave them plenty of bombs.  One of Gen Birdwood's aide-de camps was killed this morning shot in three places with shrapnel whilst asleep outside his dugout he lingered for an hour, Eric  P was down to see me this morning he's OIT again a mail arrived & I got 5 but still no parcels.  Finished the bomb proof under plenty of lead tonight but dodged 0ne.  Harold not too good tonight.  More guns to be landed tonight & taken round to the left flank, no more colonial ammo to be landed but any amount of MARIT VII & whips of artillery stuff, shells pretty thick all day & a Capt Armstrong killed at the beach.  All sorts of rumors are afloat as to what and where we are going to when relieved shortly but India is the favorite at present.  Incendiary bomb received at 190029 July 1915Thursday
We landed a battery of 60 pounders & 3 of 18 pdrs last night also with the necessary equipments, ammunition is arriving by the boat-load along with stores, Two german aeroplanes came over at 1800 one was driven off by two French & British planes, the other passed over our lines & again our planes chased him, he dropped a bomb on the Turks who again in their turn turned their anti-aircraft on him, after he had flown a couple of miles he was seen to cut out & then [indecipherable], he then capsized burst into flames & then disappeared over a small hill.  The Turks gave our trenches hell from about 5 guns & all men had to be taken out of the trenches, but only for that the day had been very quiet along the whole front but down at the beach they are getting tons of shell they seem to have found out at last the real value of their guns & just how much damage they can inflict with them
