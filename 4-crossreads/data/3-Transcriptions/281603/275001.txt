<p>February &amp;  <strike>March</strike> 1917</p>
<p>When our twenty four hours were up we went into the line again &amp; were releived early next morning &amp; went back to supports.  On the <strike>8th</strike> night of the 8th we were releived by the 1st Battalion &amp; we moved back to No. 5 Camp Bazentin.  While in this camp half the company was sent on fatigue work to Clarke's Dump for a few days.  We were awakened during the early hours of the 25th to stand to as it had been found that the Germans had evacuated their forward position.  Everything was excitement for we had extra gear etc issued &amp; was under a moments notice to move to the firing line.  Our next move came on the eve of the 27th when we left camp &amp; was loaded up ready for all emergencies &amp; when about a third of the journey had been walked we had to pick up tins of water.  We had a long march &amp; passed over the evacuated ground &amp; through the village of Le Barque &amp; into a big chalk pit where we rested for a while.  After a short spell we moved out &amp; started to dig a support line &amp; dug on ground with grass on &amp; very few shell holes.  After digging for about an hour we again moved forward through the village of Thilloy &amp; releived the Eleventh Battn. &amp; dug in which had to be done with an entrenching tool.  Our chief duties in this position was to keep quiet of a day &amp; patrol work</p>
