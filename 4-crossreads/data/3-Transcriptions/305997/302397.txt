<p>Extract from Lord Kitchener's statement in the House of Lords, on Wednesday, September 15th, 1915.</p>
<p>The Operations In Gallipoli.</p>
<p>"In the course of these operations the gallantry and resourcefulness of the Australian and New Zealand troops have frequently formed a subject for eulogy in Sir Ian Hamilton's reports.  General Birdwood and his Staff have greatly distinguished themselves, both in planning and conducting the operations of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, whose activities have been marked by constant success.  Their determination to overcome apparently insuperable difficulties has been no less admirable than their courage in hand-to-hand fighting with the enemy."</p>

<p>The Military Situation.</p>
<p>"No words of admiration can be too strong, I am sure the House will agree, for the gallantry and resource displayed by the whole of our Armies, and, if I may give one conspicuous illustration, by the Australian and New Zealand troops throughout those hazardous and arduous operations."</p>
