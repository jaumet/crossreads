  
 [Saturday 16 September 1916] 
 Mr & Mrs Neill came today to the Hospital to see me.  I leave at noon with Dolly for St Anns-on-Sea.  Charlie's wife meets us at the train.  I am better & it is warmer.  Charlie's wife is a dear little fair girl with blue eyes same size as Dolly & you Mother.  We had lunch & I arrived here at St Annes on Sea at 9 pm. No one met us as Dolly made a mistake in the day she telegraphed anyway Father is not in favour of War weddings so don't know what will happen yet.
