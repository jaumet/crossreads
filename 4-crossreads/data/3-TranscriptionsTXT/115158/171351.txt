J. Jellicoe, &amp; then for some unaccountable reason turned &amp; steamed between our main fleet &amp; the enemy, accompanied by &quot;Warrior&quot; &amp; &quot;Shannon&quot;.&nbsp; The &quot;Defence&quot; &amp; &quot;Black Prince&quot; soon succumbed to the superior fire of the larger German ships, &amp; &quot;Warrior&quot; bore off in a badly damaged condition, &amp; was, eventually, abandoned by her crew.&nbsp; The &quot;Invincible&quot; blew up somewhat later during the action than &quot;Indefatigable&quot;.&nbsp; Thus, the action raged from 3.45 p.m. until about 6 p.m. when our main Battle Fleet appeared on the scene.&nbsp; Our battle-cruisers, which had for the greater part of the time fought their five ships against seven of the enemy, fought magnificently.&nbsp; No sooner had our Grand Fleet appeared than the German Fleet made for their base, &amp; actually our battleships were only in touch with them for 6 minutes.&nbsp; Owing to the mist, a chase was impracticable, especially as the enemy split up &amp; retreated independently.
