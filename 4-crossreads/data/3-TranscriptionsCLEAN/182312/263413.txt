 own make.  The people themselves and their wares were so clean look- 
 ing that everybody bought from them a thing they would never think of 
 doing from the filthy pedlars of Egypt.  The troop train from Mar- 
 seilles was an eye-opener.  One of the chaps stepped it out and she 
 was 350 yards long.  If you had asked a N.S.W. Railway man to haul 
 it from Sydney to Strathfield he would have taken a fit.  He would

 mountains rise up abruptly sometimes within a few hundred yards of 
 the river.  The scene constantly changes from rugged grandeur to 
 peaceful pasture country and was a source of constant wonder to our 
 troops.  We were treated with great kindness by the people on the
