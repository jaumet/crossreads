Lovely beds &amp; a wash before turning in, the luxury of it all after our late home being taken quite naturally. At the station we were met by a representative of the Soldiers home who tried to persuade us to stay there but we were only in Paris for 4 days so did not mind the expense of a decent hotel. The work these people are doing is of great value and makes it possible to men with little money to see the city without being robbed or getting into trouble.
