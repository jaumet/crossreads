<p>We passed two ships today one of which was challenged by our cruiser, but allowed to go on its way; the other was a well-known American packet boat.</p>
<p>Jan. 21. We all attended Church Parade this morning and by way of novelty wore our life-belts there. In the evening we had a sing-song from Alexander's hymn-book until it was too dark to see and then of course the cold drive us down stairs until next morning. We do enjoy singing the old, well-known hymns and sending up our petitions to the throne of grace on behalf of those whom we have left behind in Australia.</p>
<p>Jan. 22. On guard again. Alan &amp; I had posts next to one another and so did not mind the job in the slightest, although the night shifts were very cool.</p>
<p>Jan. 23. Rough and cold and windy to-day. Boys seem extra noisy &amp; happy. We slept all day, had a cold shower before tea &amp; read etc. in evening.</p>
