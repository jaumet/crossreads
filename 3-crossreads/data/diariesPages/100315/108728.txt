30/3/18 ? La Basse Ville
A dull and wet day today ? the league of Gott the Hun once more. The first issue of the "22nds Salvo" put in its appearance today. Before lunch Colonel Miles, C.M.G., D.S.O. called with the B.M. for a yarn. Sent a few fresh officers up the line to relieve others. Afternoon Jack came along and we spent the time talking about family affairs. A gas stunt is projected for tonight and all the orders are being made out now. Rain came on at dusk and made conditions miserable. All the trenches wet and slippery. He was shelling more than usual
