 the line as I do not know where she will land (at Suez or Said) but she and Batemans will travel together to Benha &ndash; about  1/2 hour from Cairo and I can meet her there at least.  Lines are like this ... [line drawing of positions of towns in Egypt &ndash; Cairo, Benha, Alex, Pt Said, Ismaiha and Suez]. Both Said and Suez trains join together art Ismaiha and the Alexandria passengers get out at Benha about 3 hours  express from Alex.  I may be able to meet her at one of the extremities if I get word intime as to her place of arrival. However I have written to her at Aden giving full particulars of the journey and Batemans will know what to do and she will follow them. 
 Thank you so much for all you have done for us and your loving concern that she should be safe to Adelaide. i am waiting to hear all about it from Ol's own lips. 
 Post arrangements to Aus are not reliable and quite a number of things have been lost. so glad the broach arrived allright. 
 Love to mother and madelle Anna
