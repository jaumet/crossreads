& had a "grand banquet". The journey was full of such incidents – at Zazazig we were allowed to get off the train to stretch our legs & buy what refreshments we desired.

We arrived at Heliopolis at about 6, after a short march from the Station.

Much impressed by the residential appearances of these suburbs of Cairo. Wide tar-paved streets with mostly big cement colored houses bearing the resemblance of flats. The majority contain gardens & everything has an air of grandeur about it.

We camped on the desert – great many were already under canvas – British, Victorians, New Zealanders & N.S.W. In fact all Australia is represented.

Great bustle in camp. Cheered all along the way of march. Glad to get rid of packs.

Slept on the desert outside mess-room which is built of light wood.

Reveille at 5. Breakfasted at Heliopolis at a French Restaurant. Heliopolis is within Camp bounds. Pass needed for Cairo.

Heliopolis I find is regarded by the natives as a Holy Town. Here it was, I am told, that Joseph converted Mary & wooed her. What a mixture of humanity is here. Arabians, Soudanese, French, Italian, Swiss – in fact all the polyglot crowd of the Northern Africa. What a shrill cacophony greets our ears – the bargaining natives swarm round us with their goods & exhort us to buy at extravagant figures. As we sit at breakfast small Arab boys, dirty & ill clothed, cry for backsheesh & grovel & scramble in the dust for cigarette ends.

Breakfast cost us about two piastres, equivalent to 5d. in English money.

Our O.C., Mr. Richards, arrives from Suez.

Daily Routine – Reveille 5. Early parade 6 to 9 a.m. Breakfast 9-15 – as soon after early parade as is possible. Lecture 11 to 12. Parade 5 to 7 p.m. The morning parade is a killer – 3 hours on an empty stomach – we shall without doubt get "fit" under these conditions or "go out to it" altogether. As it is impossible to drill for any length of time in the midday heat
