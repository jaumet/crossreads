<p>Fine, but cold. I was on stable picket all day. All the men had to go through a riding school in the morning. It was decided that&nbsp;<s>all</s>&nbsp;<sup>each of</sup>&nbsp;the batteries was to have different coloured horses so they drew for the colours in the evening &amp; the 27<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;drew the black horses,&nbsp;much to everybodies delight, though personally I would rather have the greys.</p>
