 SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 1919. 
 Fine, with hot W gale blowing all 
 day. Al &amp; Barry &amp; Graham &amp; Mum went 
 over to Coomoo Coomoo for lunch 
 They brought Marj. back at night. 
 I was about the house all day. Went 
 for a walk round Hut &amp; Strand 
 scrubs&nbsp;in evening with Linda &amp; 
 shot a few bunnies
