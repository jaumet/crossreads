Tuesday 20 February 1917
I was warned last night to be ready to attend a Cavalry School at Zeitoun, a suburb of Cairo for 1 month - I am glad - it means a refresher, a course for Senior Officers - BATHS, clean clothes & Tucker & a chance to get rid of my infernal NILE BOILS etc:-  I go in about 3 days time.
Yesterday a few HATS were being issued - 1 Soldier tried one & said QUATER (meaning Q.M.S.) this hat is too small, what one is it - the Quartermaster Sergeant replied 6 7/8. Well, give me a 9.10.11 replied the Wag (TRUE). Lovely warm day but cold nights still.
