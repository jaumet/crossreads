<p>out at 10 a.m. to personally interview the various deliniquent suppliers &amp; did not return until 3.15 p.m., however by 4 p.m. everything is ready to proceed to sea, but tis then discovered that the Chief Engineer who had set out on an errand to induce the authorities to give him an extra Engineer had not retuned. 5 p.m.  As there is still no sign of the Chief it is decided that we cast off &amp; make for Williamstown &amp; there await his return. Being a very hot night I allowed the Canteen to be opened &amp; the rush that was made by those boys in khaki, beggars description.  However whilst the "beano" was in full progress, the Chief Engineer with a new sixth in tow arrived &amp; the Ship was soon under way bound for London via Colombo &amp; Egypt.</p>
<p>Feby 3rd (Wednesday)  Ship rolling a good deal today, consequently a good many Soldiers who are not Sailors, are ill. Anyway they all appear pretty happy.  The horses are a good deal affected too by the rolling, some of them imagining they are backing 2 tons up a hill each roll she takes. I got that information from a very reliable "hource".</p>
<p>Feby 4th (Thursday)<br/>Arose 7 a.m. &amp; have discovered a fresh water bath in the Ship (the only one), in the Isolation Ward, so as long as no-one needs isolating I can have a fresh water bath each morning. (I put this paragraph here so as to make people beleive that I wash.)</p>
