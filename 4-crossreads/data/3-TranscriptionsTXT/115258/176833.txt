His old home in New South was Benduck, near Hay. They have started two newspapers over here which I am going to subscribe to and think I&#39;ll send them home as well. One is the KIORA-COOEE and A, &amp; NZ paper issued monthly. I have read its first spasm and its jolly good. The other is the Palestine news and is for the whole army here. They both seem pretty good papers. There is most beautiful feed round here, and running water in every wadi - our early morning patrol to-day saw some gazells in along the foothills and there are wild flowers everywhere only they would be tame ones in Australia, because most of the wild flowers here are grown in the gardens at home.
