<p>not allowed to land.<br/>We had been told that great preparations had been made to give us a good time so that we were keenly disappointed.  All that we saw of the people of Australia was a few who came out on a small steam boat and cruised around the ship looking for some of their friends.<br/>Many sharks are to be seen swimming around the ship.  Some of the troops are trying to bait them with a lump of meat.  Others have been successful in shooting some.<br/>Cases of Cigarettes and Fruit have been sent aboard by people from the town.  We can see the town away in the distance.</p>
<p>Nov. 18th<br/>Sick patients sent ashore.  The West Australians left the ship and went ashore to-day.<br/>We sailed away from the vicinity of Fremantle at 4 this afternoon.</p>
<p>Nov. 19th<br/>Since we left Fremantle yesterday the ship has rolled considerably.  This has been the worst part of our voyage.<br/>Huge birds are following in the rear of the ship.</p>
