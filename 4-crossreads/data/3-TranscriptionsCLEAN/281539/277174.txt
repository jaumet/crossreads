  
 25/9/15  on Friday next. Glad to have an Australian back although Smyth very fair. HQ says nothing can come up to our men, and mention the Territorial's want of "guts" so very evident here. Vacated a trench when attacked by massed battalions 15000 strong. Ours hold on - 5000 killed and wounded by our artillery & m.g.s and then Australians leap out to meet them. No "vacating" for them. Insects here not very numerous. Two species of ants somewhat like bulldog variety & always at war with each other. Occasional dragon fly to be seen. Myriads of small house flys most persistent. Kept down very much by the scrupulous thoroughness of the sanitary arrangemts. The blowfly a small genus with beautiful golden belly. A gay bird for the loathsome banquet he comes from. Saw one corpse, good looking young fellow, he had been covered with these golden flys and just  of  a blaze of gold. Crawling in one eye and out the other! 
 Hear Luscombe is a prisoner of war at Constantinople.
