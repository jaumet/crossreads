<p>Horseferry Road, Anzac Buffet but after calling in the Policeman to my aid I was successful in getting a Taxi, the driver meanwhile grunting out "I ain't got much petrol", we sped on our way and reached the Anzac Buffet all right.</p>
<p>There I got a bed on the Floor and making myself comfortable for a few hours I went to sleep, getting up early enough to catch the train for Folkestone. There were hundreds of bed in this place, some made like the berths on a ship others consisted of mattresses on the floor.</p>
<p>I was sorry that I did not see much of London, but one cannot get all one wants so they have just got to be content with what they get.</p>
<p>Dec 6th. Wed.<br/>Getting my gear from the Head Quarters at 5 a.m and inquiring my way from a policeman, as the streets were pitch dark I ultimately reached the crowd of troops who were returning from leave at Victoria Station. The station was packed with soldiers and friends to see them off.</p>
<p>Getting a comfortable seat we left in the train at 7 a.m. Feeling a bit tired I <strike>sleep</strike> slept all the way.</p>
<p>We arrived at Folkestone at 9.45.</p>
<p>After some maze like wanderings</p>
