its naturally very prominently National colors lined very conspicuously from end to end of hull, with name ? BENGALEN, ROTTERDAM ? in large block letters in centre. Also passed New Zealand transport 52, returning. Fairly large city situated on Arabian coast on Starboard side; probably Mocha, unable to say for certain. Saw large shoal of Dolphin from bow of boat, very much like porpoises only much faster in their movements. Have passed a great number of small Islands since entering Red Sea. All barren, not a blade of grass to be seen on any of them. Concert at night, both Bob Roberts Eric Herford contributed to programme. End of a very interesting day. As from today
