<p>Thur. Nov 30.  Paraded at 9 &amp; got ready to go out &amp; face the foe again.  We went out to No. 3 Post (Battery) the worst of the lot.  It is about a mile &amp; a half long.  There are duck boards the whole distance, but in places they are in very bad condition &amp; a man stands a good risk of breaking his leg.  Snowy Atherton, Stan Wright Jacko &amp; I formed our squad.  I felt very crook &amp; carrying some of the heavy chaps nearly broke me up.  An awful lot of trench feet cases came through but very few wounded.  Our dugout is very small &amp; 4 of us have to squeeze very tight to get in at all</p>
<p>Fri. DEC 1st  Last night was awful.  Our fire went out &amp; it was freezing, the chats got busy &amp; chewed us to pieces.  A few cases came through up to midday, then she quietened down.  To make matters worse no rum came to light last night.  Jacko &amp; I brought in a load of wood from Delville  we  got a fire going &amp; cooked some Bacon.  After Dinner Fritz put a good few shells over &amp; livened things up a bit.  About 6 p.m. the cases commenced coming through again.  More trench feet.  Some of the poor beggars are in an awful mess.  I just returned from taking in a patient when something went wrong with the works &amp; I broke down.  Reg Hancock took my place in the squad.  Fritz put over a barrage &amp; got some of the 29th as they were changing over.  One good thing it was moonlight &amp; we could see our way quite plainly.  The French &amp; our guns replied to Fritz's challenge &amp; the din was terrific.</p>
<p>Sat. 2.  About 60 patients came through during the night &amp; our crowd were knocked out.  Bricky, Jimmy Woods &amp; a no. of others broke down during the night.  Our fire was burning low &amp; Snowy Atherton went out &amp; got a tin of kerosene to liven it up.  He poured it on &ndash; &amp; the fire went bang out.  He made a mistake &amp; brought water instead of oil.  Needless to say he got some very uncomplimentary remarks hurled at him.</p>
