  
 Monday 23 August, 1915 
 Have been talking to some Ghurkas. We cooked our breakfast in the trenches, water is scarce but we have been well supplied with food so far. 
 We have been busy improving our trenches all day. A few stray shots have come our way but no one has been hurt, we have had plenty of food & water. 
 We are still 700 yards behind the firing line. We have had several casualties. The enemy have sent a few shrapnel shells against our trenches, severly wounding one man. 
  The Gurrkas made a slight advance during the night and  the stray bullets have been very bad. We are becoming expert cooks, with the limited utensils at our disposal.
