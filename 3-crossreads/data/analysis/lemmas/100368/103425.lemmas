 we would all get off the posit safe . After we heard what was actual go to happen we were more at eas but candid speak I do not expect to get away . Dec 15th Wed . Still on the "qui vive " Bring up larg quantiti of store from the A.S. Depot and store them insid the station ground . Foodstuff of all descript are store here . Small trestl bridg be built from the beach to the sunken ship " Milo" . Issu with forti eight hour iron ration and order to keep our water bottl fill . We have also been issu with first field dress and larg quantiti are in the tent in case of emerg . Dec 16th Thur . A nose cap from a shell land in B.R.S dugout . He had a narrow escap from injuri . The shell seem to be get more near everi time , to our place of abod . The hit all but get on to the pier and the barg . As I write this the shell are buzz over our head and burst too near to be comfort . Two member of our unit woke up this morn and found a shell case lie between them . Apparent the shell after have got rid of it shrapnel had drop through the roof of their dugout whilst they were asleep and it did not disturb there slumber . Put on guard over the water tank in Reserv Gulli . They have been fill with water and are onli to be use by the hospit . D.I. reliev me . At twelv oclock midnight just as I had gone on guard duti a great flare got up just from about the last tent in the C.C.S. Then a short time afterward the Armi Ordnanc Store and the Armi Servic Store were set afir . The whole of north beach was light up and bellow of smoke mount high up into the air and becam so dens that the full moon and star were hidden from one 's sight . The Turk throughout the night kept send shell over at irregular interv and some of them land just by the side of the " Milo " and the new trestl bridg which had so late been put up . I was stand besid the water tank troop in small bodi of two hundr or so , came march quiet down the gulli . Their boot were pad with sandbag etc . in order to deaden the nois of march and so well was this accomplish that they seem like tread on air and they vanish befor I knew . A chap came run down the gulli in a great hurri . Soon afterward he came back carri a stretcher and on make inquiri I learnt that a shell had drop into an offic 's dug-out and had wound him . A coupl of mule pass by veri slowli and they made me start , they , be white gave me the impress of see ghost . Soon afterward an Aussi think that it was better to ride than to walk had mount this mule and pass by me like an apparit , the other mule walk quiet behind . In the earli morn noth but the sound of a few bird and the crack , crack , crack of machin gun and rifl fire broke the dead silenc . It was exceed eeri wait on day break . Near all the Indian have left here . They did valuabl work transport store up to the trench with their mule and cart . This account for the few mule that are stay about without anyon in charg . The sun , as it rose this morn took on a peculiar reddish appear , owe I have no doubt to the dens smoke which is come from the burn store . The sea was beauti and calm all night . Dec 18th Sat . A divin servic ea held in the shrapnel shelter . The Rev Captain Dexter gave a splendid and an appropri address base on Psalm 46 . rather a peculiar incid was , in illustr his address , he told us three stori which were taken from the book entitl " The Psalm in Human Life " which I had read dure my stay on Anzac and a book which I have in my possess at this time . As we came out of the shelter after the servic , shrapnel burst over our head and spread into the sea near the " Milo" . Had a parad of all men and receiv order how to proceed dure the evacu . The unit has been divid into four parti . No 4 parti is to leav the shelter first , No 3 next No 2 to follow and No 1 last . D. and myself are in No 2 parti . Bingham who is be evacu sick is take a letter which he is go to post to Georg , so tha if I am miss the peopl at home will know that I am a prison of war in Turkey . We have been address by Major Campbel our new O.C. and the tone of his address gave us confid that we would get off all right . Dec 19th Sun . On water tank guard , I saw no troop dure the night but I am told that ten thousand had left Anzac Cove pier dure the nightim . Shrapnel was sent over dure the night-tim . The " Store " fire still burn fierc . In spite of the fact that this fire has been burn two night and a day , there is a tremend amount still to be burn up yet . A larg number of bottl of beer and champagn etc . were destroy last night . These belong to our offic . Such luxuri could never be allow to common rank and file Oh ! No, No. Ordere to take our pack down to the shelter and to parad there at ten thirti to-night . Put up a notic on our dug-out " Apartment to let " Appli . When we come back again . A larg number of troop with muffl feet pass on their way to the beach , to embark . A beauti moonlight night and the sea nice and calm . As we wait quiet on the weari hour pass away we were provid with music from the gramophon which had onli been in use in the offic mess previous . The one tune that was the favourit and was play over a few time was " the Rosari " . A copper had been place near the shelter and our cook made cocoa for us . The floor of the shelter was cover with hospit mattress and on these we all lay huddl to-geth till the time should come for us to depart . Strang to say not a shell has been sent over to-night . The slightest sound made us prick up our ear expect everi minut to be heavili bombard . I have onli a faint recollect of hear No 4 and 3 depart . About 3.30 in the morn we , who were left , automat put our pack on our back and left the shelter and made for the beach . On our way we met the machin gunner carri their machin gun along . They had live the ridg abov us and were our last line of defenc . We cross over the small trestl bridg on to the " Milo " and from the " Milo " we embark on the barg . We wait on the barg for some time and dure the time we were wait a terrif crack , crack of rifl and the heavi sound of an explos either of a mine or a big gun be blown up , was heard . At five minut to four the barg left the " Milo " and we were speed our way to the Hospit ship " Dongala" , not a man from our unit miss . How this evacu was work is marvel , for had the Turk known of our intent there must have been a veri differ stori to tell . It seem strang that not one shell should drop on the beach dure the whole of the night we were leav . There had been a terrif bombard of Gabe Tepe dure yesterday forenoon and rumour had it that Beachi Bill had been silenc , be that the reason or not I do not know , but this is certain , no shell drop on the beach dure the final evacu . Dec 20th Mon . Much to the surpris of the staff on board the " Dongola " instead of see wound men pour on to the ship . A thing they were fulli prepar for , they saw healthi but tire men walk up the step carri their pack on their back . We were all dog-weari , I had n't had a decent wash all the time I had been on the Peninsular , and had about a fortnight growth of beard on my face , wear a Tommi cap on my head , an Aussi tunic and Tommi trouser I for one must have look a pictur . When we got aboard the " Dongola " we all rush the bathroom for a bath , Hot cocoa was provid and clean sheet and a comfort bed made us feel as if we had land into Paradis . Look from the ship away on to the posit we had just left all one could see was the bright light of the burn store , and about fifti yard from the hospit ship a British warship slowli pass us by . I was too dead tire to take ani more interest in what was go on and get down below to my bed I tumbl into it and slept sound . We arriv in the harbour at Lemno about eleven oclock . We had onli been a few hour on the " Dongola " but we were splendid look after . The nurs on board were tumbl over themselv take our photos.A rather amus thing happen while the nurs were take our photo some of the chap who had camera snap the nurs at the same time . There were a larg number of ship of all descript in the harbour most relat to the men of war and hospit ship . Rumour has it that the Turk pour shrapnel all over the beach after we left this morn , luckili for us that we had flown . After we had dinner we embark on the ship boat and were tow by a pinnac to the " Dunbar Castl " . Col G. who was our O.C. up to two day ago but had left us befor the evacu , was on this ship . Some of our offic went aboard her for a short time . We then went to Mudro , one of the larg town on the Island . On our arriv there we had to march to Sarpi Camp . After a good deal of hang about we found veri uncomfort quarter await us . Dec 21st Tue . Heavi rain fell after breakfast . The road were ankl deep in mud . We left Sarpi Camp for No 3 A.G.H. In order to avoid the muddi road we sail over in small boat across a bay in which there were a great mani bright colour boat of the sail type presum fish boat belong to the island . Dec 22nd Wed . R I went for a walk around the villag which were wide scatter and built ani old how . They were out of bound to troop from twelv till five oclock . Later we saw a number of windmil situat on a rais part of the island . These windmil were built of stone and do not seem to chang their posit like the windmil that I have seen . We went over to the church which stood on the outsid of the villag . We could not get insid it but peer in through the window we saw figur paint in gaudi colour like those in R.C. Church . The grave-yard surround the church and in the corner of the churchyard was a small hous into which the bone of those , after they have been a certain time in the earth are thrown . This littl hous was half full of human bone of all kind . Rather a strang custom and gruesom manner of do thing . A militari graveyard begun sinc the troop arriv here is grow rapid . It is be well kept . We are have a veri easi time at present and wander over these field one felt as if they were free men again , we are at present free from all militari restraint . The old farmer plough with the old fashion wooden plough drawn by a pair of bullock , The women wash their cloth at the well outsid of the villag , Littl children carri bucket of water from the well and the bird sing in the field make a veri pretti scene . We part the villag school door . It , be open and hear the sound of mani children 's voic in an unknown tongu we look insid . There was the old schoolmast , a vener old man seat on a high chair and a desk in front of him give lesson of some natur or other to a big number of Greek children . The children were all attent when we got to the door but one or two of them notic us and and the signal was go round the room so that we thought that it would be better to leav them . At present everyth is bare and barren on the island but as far as I can learn thing are veri much differ in the summer time . There are a larg number of militari hospit on Lemno island . They are all veri well laid out and are principli tent with a few weather board build . The land is cover with stone and these have been util to decor the outsid of the tent .

The hous are built of freeston but in an irregular fashion . No regular street abgout the place . Near everi hous had turn itself into a place for sell luxuri , Chocol , orang , nut , tin fruit , sardin , biscuit , fig etc were for sale but at exorbi price . Still so crowd were these small villag withtroop and there was such a demand for these luxuri that even at exorbi price these luxuri were be sold in larg quantiti . Scatter all around these villag street were refus of all descript . Orang skin , paper , tin galor , gave the place a veri unwholsom appear . Between sell luxuri , the women wash soldier cloth , and the men row boat about from one place to anoth the island must be make a mint of money . The troop have made a splendid road over the island . Outsid of the villag the inevit game of pitch and toss is be play by the troop , especi the Aussi , for larg sum of money . Noth less than note be taken . One Greek youth was play at an anchor board . He was onli about fourteen year of age , and he had won about thirti bet without a loss . Other spent there time play footbal and the usual excit remind one of Saturday afternoon game at home . Dure the forenoon D.R.I. went through the Egyptian camp . They are a labour corp help to make roadway on the island . They look a dirti , miser , set of individu and are of all age . They are dress in the most grotesqu manner imagin . It seem that they pick up ani old piec of cloth that they find lie about and wear it . The result is one see them go about dress up in old pyjama suit , Overcoat blanket etc and these , in conjunct with their own nativ dress make them look ridicul in the extrem . Their chatter , chatter all the time they are work make one wish them far enough away . A big number of them have die here .
