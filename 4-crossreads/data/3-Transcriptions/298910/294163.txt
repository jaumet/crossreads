<p><u>The Red Cross Bloke</u></p>
<p>Not a blinking rap do we care for the chap<br/>With the Red Cross on his sleeve,<br/>Till we get to the front, on the stand to stunt,<br/>and a farewell Bomb when you leave,<br/>Midst the flying death you hold your breath,<br/>and life seems suddenly dear<br/>While the Red Cross chap is out of the scrap<br/>In the safest part at the rear.</p>
<p>It don't seem fair for him to be there,<br/>While we face the poison an smoke,<br/>An' check the Huns with red hot guns<br/>an' cheer, an curse, an choke.<br/>But many a lad feels thundering glad,<br/>When night lends a sheltering a cloak,<br/>To be overhauled by the cloak he's called<br/>The blooming red cross bloke.</p>
<p>My own turn came, its part of the game &ndash;<br/>In a scrap we had before Loos<br/>When the blinking Huns tried to pinch the guns,<br/>Of the 5th &ndash; never mind whose &ndash;<br/>They tried an' tried, an you bet they died<br/>While we lost many a chum.<br/>Till word came through &ndash; now lads stand to &ndash;<br/>And be next was "Here they come.<br/>We charged and yelled, and the line was held<br/>But I can't remember the rest,<br/>For the earth spun around an I hit the ground<br/>With daylight in my chest.</p>
<p>When next I awoke, a Red Cross bloke,<br/>Was crossing that zone of death<br/>An I watched come through the shrapnel hum<br/>Just watched an' held my breath,<br/>Till he reached my side with a crawl an glide,<br/>An' I blessed his crimson crest,<br/>For he made me snug with a comfy plug<br/>On the painful hole in my chest.<br/>Then away he crept, an' I must have slept<br/>For when I awoke with the pain,</p>
<p>Over</p>
