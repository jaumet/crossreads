<p>26th August <br/>Still we linger so do the "Sydney" &amp; "Encounter". No excitement. Wrote a letter. Had a wash. Got served out with sundry shirts &amp; sweaters. Swore considerably. Soldiers &amp; Sailors on the life boat. Sailors came back at 5.45 Soldiers not yet returned 7.46.<br/> 8.46 Weary splashes heard hard to port (a seaman's phrase) 9.46 Several weary punters retire to roost. Many other jovial punters dance rags on the promenade.</p>
<p>Some more excitement. "Encounter's" brass band comes aboard 8 PM. Discourse wonderful music. More excitement. Stewards bring round chocolates 4 for 6d. Another graze with a higher civilization.</p>
