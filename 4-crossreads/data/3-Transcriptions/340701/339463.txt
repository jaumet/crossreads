<p>somebody blundering around for souvenirs must have fell over it.</p>
<p>Saturday 31-3-17<br/>left the works today for Bapaume on the way we passed 10 Tanks and 5 aeroplanes which had come to grief.  The Tanks were all alongside the road &amp; generally upside down.  Bapaune is a terrible wreck.  The damage was nearly all done by mines not by our shells.   the country is undulating &amp; grassy &amp; very few shell holes are visible.  A Taube brought down one of our  Baloons today.  The occupants of the car escaped in a parachute.</p>
