<p>is apparently no objection to your sitting on it if you feel that way disposed.&nbsp; The trouble is not in the going down or the coming up.&nbsp; The trouble is at the top and at the bottom, the &quot;latter&quot; mostly, at least so I found it.</p>
<p>At the foot of this &quot;moving stairway&quot; is a brass &quot;mat&quot; or &quot;disc&quot; on which you are supposed to step, (personally I should have thought rubber would have been safer).&nbsp; Having on military boots with a steel &quot;heel-tip&quot; made the &quot;stepping-off&quot; process decidedly exciting for myself and very amusing to the onlookers.&nbsp; Of course I sat down on that brass mat quicker than the crowd at the back of me expected.&nbsp; Personally it did not in the least surprise me.&nbsp; Someone immediately after was good enough to advise me to always step-off with the right foot, as I had done this on the occasion in question, the next time I tried with the left foot, with an exactly similar result.&nbsp; I tried jumping off with both feet at once, but the end was the same.&nbsp; I always landed with &quot;high velocity&quot; on the brass mat, in a sitting position.&nbsp; At last I decided to travel the whole distance in that position which I found to be far more successful and much less painful, if perhaps disappointing to the onlookers.&nbsp; I verily believe that many people used to spend many enjoyable hours sitting on the station watching the uninitiated measure their length at the foot of that escolator.&nbsp; Whenever I wished to go to a place that had one of these &quot;jokes&quot;, I went by bus, or tram, or walked.&nbsp; They fairly got my wind up, and yet so many just went down them in a most annoyingly [handwritten amendment to &#39;annoying&#39;] casual, everyday kind of way.&nbsp; Not any more escolators for me thanks.</p>

<p>Another thing that rather &quot;put the wind&quot; up me was one time when on leave from France, I had arrived at some station on the underground and not being sure of the way out, I as usual followed the crowd, when they all stopped I thought that there was a &quot;block&quot; at the gate owing to the slowness of the man collecting tickets, and felt sorry for him, when all of a sudden without the slightest warning the whole place &quot;lifted&quot; up.&nbsp; My first thought was that the station had been &quot;mined&quot; and that in the next few moments many of us would</p>
