24/12/17 Kortepypcake of soap for a Xmas present! The cobbled pave road was busy with motor lorries and caterpillars hauling big guns. Returned to camp and after dinner tried some orderly room cases. Left at 3.15 p.m. to inspect Swanton's party at the 6th Engineers. Found them clean and very well. A thick fog came down over the country and the remains of white frozen snow and thick frost still lies on the ground. All pools are ice covered to a depth of inches. Such is our Xmas Eve 1917 and it might be much worse. Neuve Eglise has been well strafed. Its large church is roofless and ruined. A few direlict inhabitants wander round its little streets now full of soldiers. A. Smith returned from the Anzac Corps School and says it has gone off. Heavy snow has stopped train traffic round Amiens.
