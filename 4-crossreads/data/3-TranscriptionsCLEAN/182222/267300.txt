 Fine hot day. Calm sea. cold water. Crowd on beach (which is all pebbles) no shoots, but a limitless stretch of swimming space & no sharks.                                                            The kiddies here seem to tumble to me. Joe has noticed the same thing.                                                                        This town said to be dirty but considering the times & its age it can give Sydney & Melb. points.                                      Great haul of fish, many tons, on wharves.
