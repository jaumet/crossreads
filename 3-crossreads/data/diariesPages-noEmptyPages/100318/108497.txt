About 3.30 am the General rang me up and said that they had heard nothing of Col James all night and were rather anxious about it and that I was to assume command of the 24th in addition to my own. This was only for an hour or two as James turned up alright having been lost. After breakfast set out for a look at the positions. The stench of the dead horses outside is wellnigh insupportable. The Church is much damaged and had been used as a hospital. Outside lay a dead German sprawled near the threshold. A battered Chateau was alongside the Church. Walked out into a very pleasant little field and saw the posts of our firing line of two days ago. Two of our men were lying dead on stretchers covered with groundsheets to keep the flies off.
