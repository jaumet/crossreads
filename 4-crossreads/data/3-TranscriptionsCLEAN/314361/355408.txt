  
 comes up I suppose, some  a light battery has taken up a position just in front this afternoon, but I suppose that the heavy will come when the roads have been repaired a  bit. There has been a little gun fire, but we have had no shells our way as yet. We thought that we were going to be relieved but it appears that it has been put off for a couple of weeks. It is very cold again, with light rain. Villers au Flos. Mar, 21st 17. I spent this morning exploring the Chateau de Villers au Flos & grounds. If ever there was an instance of arrogant vandalism we have one here. The chateau at one time must have been a beautiful place standing in beautiful grounds, now it is a heap of ruins, not so much from shell fire. The Germans left the place a perfect wreck. What was not affected by shells, was purposely knocked or blown down, so that, I suppose it could not be used by us. They evidently used the cellars as the HQ, but even those they have blown up, it is now full of debris. There are only three or four rooms left standing,  one of them is littered with paper & old documents belonging to the compte, among them I found a few interesting stamps, (postage & postage due) & also some interesting papers
