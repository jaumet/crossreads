<p>glad to hear Keith is getting on and awfully glad for your sake he won't be able to come back. He's done his share. I only hope that in time he'll get over everything. One sees so many wonderful cases of recovery these days that it seems that to die of wounds is rare.</p>
<p>One little cove for instance hit a C.C.S. with some of his stomach sticking out of his skin and a pulse that was hardly working. In three days though everyone had given him up he was more or less sitting up with a nearly normal pulse though his wound hadn't been touched, Just sheer gutz that all.</p>
<p>Cheerio Judge. My love to Mrs. Ferguson &ndash; Dorothy &amp; Keith.</p>
<p>Yours very sincerely<br/>John Mant.</p>
