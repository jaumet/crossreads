 Wednesday 1 Nov. 1916 Up at 4 &amp; breakfast by 5, then up the line with the General &amp; Major Dyer. The morning was fine but towards midday the sky became overcast &amp; a little rain fell in the afternoon which was followed by a wet night. Conditions up the line were simply awful, &amp; we arrived home in a fearful state, mud everywhere. Stood by here during the afternoon, there being very little to do.
