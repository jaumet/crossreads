 1917 Sun. 17th June The "Winslow" circled the "Wolf" during the bombardment &ndash; a pretty sight under full sail in the choppy sea.

 Mon. 18th. I was called up this morning &amp; questioned by "Little Willie" &amp; the Commandant's Secretary as to the call-letters of Union Company's ships. Of course, I "knew nothing", so William decided that frankness was the better thing.  He showed me an S.O.S. message intercepted this morning from what the German operator decided was the "Waitoutar".    It was, of course, the "Waitotara", she was burnt last night. 
 The two messages were 12.    Copra on fire. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving ship.
