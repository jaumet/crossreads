<p>Sunday 21 May 1916<br/>Voluntary Church parade at 7.45 a.m.  Col. Fuller inspecting Camp.<br/>6th &amp;amp; 7th Reg. went for Swim in Ocean.<br/>Enemy's Air-o-plane dropped Bombs on Pt. Said this morning early.<br/>An alarm came to camp at 3-30 a.m. that a Taube was overhead.  Men stood to their Horses.<br/>Went for swim with Ted this afternoon it was lovely.  The beach is wide &amp;amp; long, &amp;amp; for a Bathing spot it is perfection.<br/>Word received that 6th &amp;amp; 7th Regiments have to go on a long trip tomorrow for 3 days.<br/>3 letters from Home.</p>
<p>Monday 22 May 1916<br/>Left for Bir el Ab at 8 a.m. today with 6th &amp;amp; 7th Reg. &amp;amp; Brigade H.Q.  Arrived Katia 10 a.m. &amp;amp; camped there till 8 p.m., when we left again for Ogritina.  Stayed for 2 Hours resting &amp;amp; again continued our journey at midnight.  The suppies  followed us on Camel, &amp;amp; the 2nd L.H. F. Amb. with Sand Carts accompanied the Column.  The Col. &amp;amp; Major Bruxner dug up a supposed Turkish grave &amp;amp; found instead of Bones Cases of Turkish Ammunition.  All Humpies &amp;amp; Guynas  were knocked down &amp;amp; Burnt.  The Horses were watered &amp;amp; fed before leaving on the night march.<br/>The N.Z. supported us on our right.</p>
<p>Tuesday 23 May 1916<br/>Major White returned from Cairo.<br/>General Chavel &amp;amp; party in Camp.<br/>We arrived at Bir-el-Ab at daybreak 3-35 a.m. the 7th Leading.  A number of Turks &amp;amp; Camels were watering at the well, &amp;amp; on the approach of the 7th Reg. made off, ony one Turk &amp;amp; Camel were captured.  The general opinion is that some one made a hash of the Show, &amp;amp; that not only all the Enemy &amp;amp; Animals ought to have been taken, but the Brigade should have launched out &amp;amp; had a 'go' at a number of Turks who had congregated about 3 miles to the North:  nothing was done however, &amp;amp; the Troops returned to <u>Romani</u> about 5 p.m. after practicalally doing no good.  Unless fresh Blood is infused instead this Brigade I think we will hardly earn our Salt from a fighting point of view.  The men are willing, but can do nothing without orders.</p>
<p>Wednesday 24 May 1916<br/>General Chavel &amp;amp; party proceeded to the Coast to inspect Canal that has been dug there.  They took a number of men with Shovels to further open up the drain.<br/>The majority of men &amp;amp; Horses are resting to-day.<br/>Capt. Stracker gave us some fresh Goat.<br/>Rumour is that a large number of Aus. in France have been cut up including 130 Officers.<br/>The New Zealanders sent out a partrol a few Days since, &amp;amp; they narrowly escaped being captured by a party of Turks who suddenly appeared, &amp;amp; captured some equipment &amp;amp; killed a Horse.  This happened outside Orgritina.</p>
