<p>At sea<br/>Dear Keith<br/>Just a line or two to let you know how we all are. The censorship is pretty strict so that we write only between certain narrow limits. A further restriction on general news is the monotonous life one spends at sea. You will probably get all the news from Arthur I shall merely emphasise certain salient points. First all I hope you will not forget to write as often as possible. You can supply lots of news that others can't. In your letters must be included long paragraphs dealing with unwiriely and college news and also as much news of the old school as possible. There are several things I wish to know specially. Are you up at Liverpool, if not why not? If so how do you like it and how are you getting on? How did the Grammar school get on in the football competition- the G.P.S. sports</p>
