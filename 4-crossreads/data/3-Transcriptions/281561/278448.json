<p>27/11/17.<br/>Still enjoying the "rest cure"; but I don't seem to be getting much stronger. However I suppose these "saw bones" know what they are about. Every thing here is lovely. Bonzer nurses, good food, and a real live girl, a Motor Driver; comes to visit the bloke in the next bed and she talks to me. I am well set!<br/>30/11/17.<br/>The Doctor told me to get up today "Rest Cure" finish. No feeling to gay however.<br/>2nd December 1917.<br/>Was marked for the Convalescent Camp yesterday. Drew my fighting gear after from the stores, a new set. Had a curious fainting turn this morning, can't account for it, must want work. Shall go to the Con Camp tomorrow.<br/>9/12/17.<br/>Never got to the Con-Camp. Had a relapse with Pheumonia</p>
