The interior of the works had hardly suffered and it was found necessary to blow up the guns with guncotton.

The net result of these operations against the outer works was to prove this; that although these reinforced earthworks might be smothered by shell fire and the gunners driven to their bombproofs, under highly favourable conditions, yet the actual material damage inflicted by ships' shells was relatively unimportant unless a direct hit was scored on the gun.

It would take up too much of your valuable space to describe all the operations during this period in detail, but certain events must be noted. The silencing and destruction of the outer works enabled minesweepers to enter the
