 Court Martial this morning I am Prosecutor.  Poor beggar he is charged with "Asleep on his Post" it is no wonder, & the sea air & night duties, it is hard to keep awake. Just got a letter from Laura telling me of young Charlie's wedding it certainly was kept very dark, he has been engaged for a year & 4 months she tells me, such a Kid too- he has certainly beaten his Uncles- rather upsets Braces intentions I expect- WAR Brides are certainly the fashion even for Boys, what does he know of the World!!!  All for the best I hope.
