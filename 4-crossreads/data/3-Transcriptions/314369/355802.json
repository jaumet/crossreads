<p>24 March 1915<br/>Wednesday</p>
<p>The cold wakes us up at 5 in the morning all worn out   &amp;  stiff from sleeping in our boots   &amp;  puttees.<br/>Find that no arrangement have been made for feeding us. So make a breakfast on Tinned Beef   &amp;  Biscuits brought from the Ship.<br/>More biscuit for tea, no dinner.<br/>Get some tents   &amp;  settle down to make the best of it</p>
<p>1915 March 25<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Set our own cooks to work and draw rations for the day, so all joyful again, now we have had a good feed.<br/>Do our first drill this morning in the sands of the desert.<br/>Terrible tiring on the feet   &amp; legs   &amp; damn hard to get the men to keep step</p>
