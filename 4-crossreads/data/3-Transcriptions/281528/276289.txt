<p>6/4/18 &ndash; Baizieux<br/>to Frankvillers en route for Heilly.  This place I believe has been well ratted by the Tommies &ndash; all is abandoned and there are jewellers shops &amp;c to pillage.  An interesting journey through Querrieu by bus.  We were on the road when our orders were altered and had to route march towards Baizieux where we went across country and took up a position in some undulating ground.  Then made for St. Lawrence Farm a large ruined place evidently vacated in a hurry and much pillaged by the Tommies who seem to have gone to the pack completely.  Orders now commenced to arrive.</p>
