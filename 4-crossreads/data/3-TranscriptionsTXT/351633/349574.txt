My Dear Mother,
I am writing on the eve of an event unprecedented in this war a far as this part of the campaign is concerned &ndash; I am writing a farewell to you all as I have orders with a few others from which god only knows whether I will get clear of.  I hope so &amp; am quite calm about it &ndash; it will be over one way or the other in 36 hours from now &amp; I will write you [to] you then &amp; tell you all, if I am able to do so &ndash; I cant say anything yet but just goodbye to all.  God bless you Mother dear &amp; may my brothers &amp; sisters live long enough &amp; be good enough
