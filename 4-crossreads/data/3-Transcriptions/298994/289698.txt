<p>I saw for the first time in France, the old fashioned windmill, with its enormous wings, I discovered afterwards, that it was in reality a flour mill, quite a novel affair. A large number of these peculiar windmills together makes it a curious and interesting sight.</p>
<p>The peasants in France do not treat their dogs like pets, not exactly; they are pet and worker combined!. To see a number of these large dogs of a shaggy nature harnessed up to a queer liliputian kind of rough waggon, containing the French peasant is novel.</p>
<p>Another queer sight I saw was a large rough dog standing in the rim of a large revolving wheel, propelled by the dog itself. As the dog propelled this wheel by "his feet" movements, the wheel slowly turned, that wheel was a part of the machinery of a churning implement.</p>
<p>The French farmers do not prepare their land as the farmers in Australia do, their methods are ancient &amp; of a crude nature Their fields are small, it is a common sight</p>
