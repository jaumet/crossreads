<p>are hard too.</p>
<p>Will drill from a quarter to seven until eight o clock, then breakfast of stew. Drill again from 9.30 until 12.15 then Bully beef : drill again from 1.45 until 4.30 then we are finished for the day: thank goodness.</p>
<p>I generally lie down afterwards for I generally feel pretty tired: but however I am getting a little more used to it now. I am getting quite burned my hands being very brown but my face is very red &amp; sore, it is also very warm here just now &amp; a few more weeks of it will see me a seasoned soldier.</p>
<p>We were measured for our uniforms on Thursday last, so it wont be long now before we have them: I had twenty five hours sentry duty the other night from 9 am on Thursday until 10 am on Friday morning</p>
