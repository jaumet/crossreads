<p>Monday 15 May 1916<br/>A dull threatening day but fine towards dusk. Up early &amp; had things ready for the return to camp. Breakfast in the billet with the 11th Bn. officers &amp; then had to go to D.H.Q. to wait for Capt Hearder, seeing Lt. Lindsay Cunningham while waiting there. Free about noon &amp; then hunted Leo up finding him at the house where Col. Shudeo dined, getting a surprise in also seeing there Major Matson a former lecturer in Vet. Sci. &amp; Mr. Beaurepeare, Y.M.C.A. by whom I was invited to stay for lunch. An old home surrounded by nice garden bounded by a hawthorn hedge outside which were German entanglements, &amp; a sand-bogged trench inside. In one corner 2 wooden crosses marking the graves of 2 R.E. English officers killed in action Aug. 1914. Stayed yarning to Leo in his attic until abt. 4 o'c, then had afternoon coffee together keeping a sharp look-out for Rid meantime.<br/>At 5.30 left Sailly in HQ car &amp; driven to the railhead at Steenwerck, noting 2 aeroplanes high up. Had to wait until 7.20 for our train from which we had to change into another one at Fontaine (?). A fairly cool journey, reaching Etaples at 2.10 a.m. &amp; thence having to walk out to the camp with an almost full moon just setting in the west &amp; the first light of dawn showing in the east. In bed soon after 3 a.m.</p>
