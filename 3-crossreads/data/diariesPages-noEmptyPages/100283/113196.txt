7th. The morning broke nice sunny the weather shows signs of clearing up, I am writing this sitting under one of the great sheds the sun is pouring down, in the distance Amiens lies a great white patch in a sea of green she looks very pretty with the she sun glistening on the roofs spires of the buildings while overhead the drone of our planes almost lulls one to sleep so continuous is it, they are there in hundreds coming going to the line in regular flocks, one Fritz was foolish enough to get a peep at what was going on over our way but he was simply eaten up being rushed at from all directions 
Things are very busy round our billet getting ready for the line, there are officers men about here from all
