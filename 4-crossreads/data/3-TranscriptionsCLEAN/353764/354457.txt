  
 the tents is almost unbearable. There is also a hot wind blowing which seems to burn you.  Everything you touch is hot & a pair of boots of mine which happened to be in the sun, curled up & I cannot now wear them. I received 2 more letters also 2 parcels containing Socks, Comforter, Chewing Gum, Tobacco etc from Mum & Nina. I went out last night & when returning a heavy mist was falling & I could not find my track across the Desert.  However I left it entirely to my Horse & he eventually found our Camp. 
 27.4.16 Thursday  28.4.16 Friday Two days of Transport work good & hard. On Thursday our Forces at El Kantara about 10 miles on the other side of the Canal were attacked by a large force of Turks & Austro Germans who were able to unfortunately surprise a Couple of Companies of Worcester Yeomanry. The latter suffered pretty heavily on account of their horses being killed by Artillery Fire.  However by the close of day some Irish Fusiliers arrived on the scene & charged with fixed bayonets
