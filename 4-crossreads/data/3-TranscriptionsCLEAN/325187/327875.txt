  40  20 miles East of Kantara. Very Hot & camped on the desert where the Yeomanry were cut up recently- Flies bad, but after my spell at Court Martial & Cairo I am quite satisfied to buck in [indecipherable] assistant   DAQME if you know what that is- A at Divisional H.Q. Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General- Temporarily Sounds important ?? Search lights from ships passing along Suez Canal beam across the Desert & a Military Train carries a search light also. Nothing but Sand dunes & desolation, no cultivation no Egyptians only Arabs
