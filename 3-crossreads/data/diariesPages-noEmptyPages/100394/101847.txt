We had every one of our lines broken last night by shell fire and have been out on them all day. It rained cats and dogs all the time and we got wet through. The raiders lost them salvos going over but all came back safely. Russ came round to see me this afternoon and had to go back in pouring rain

Poured all day again and we were out in it again running emergency lines. Haven’t a dry thing left to wear. Hungry as a hunter and not a thing left in the larder. There never is anyway. Have to go to F.O.O. again tomorrow. Everybody seems to be preparing for mortar now building third line with five dugouts. Romania is now officially in with us.

It turned out a beautiful day to day and I went to F.O.O. Had a very quiet day. Nothing doing at ll. I saw a taste of humour today. Some of Fritz’s shells don’t explode but simply bury themselves in the ground. Then a notice is put up by us "Blindshell" I came across one today and on the notice board was a bully-beef tin with a slit in the top
"Remember the Blind" Capt Prior sent my name in today for a school but I said I was anxious to go on the gun with Jack Burk He gave us the necessary permission but said I will have to go to the school as they couldn’t change the name. He said if we had asked to go on the guns a month ago we should both have been non-coms now.
