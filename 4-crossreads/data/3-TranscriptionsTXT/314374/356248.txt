 (64) beautiful equestrian statue of the King erected by the French nation in memory of King Edward VII, whom they adored. 
 The next day we visited the Louvre with its wonderful collections of art treasures, paintings, sculptures &amp;c.  The guide informed us that the eleven collections of art treasures in the Louvre form one of the most magnificent and complete displays in the world.  These works of art were "conveyed" (not stolen) from different countries by Napoleon during his many campaigns and never restored to their rightful owners. 
 Having been introduced to Miss Lily Butler &ndash; that fine English lady who kept the "Corner of Blighty" in the Place de la Vendome &ndash; she undertook to take a party of us to Malmaison next day. 
 This beautiful place was Josephine's (Napoleon's first wife &ndash; whom he divorced) favourite palace, and we saw all the historic and interesting things connected with this unhappy woman.  We saw the carriage she drove through the streets of Paris to the divorce in, and Napoleon's love letters to her after he divorced her. Even though he divorced her he loved her to the end. 
 In the afternoon went and saw Miss Ettie Rout, that New Zealand lady who did so much for the Anzacs in Paris.  She had a room in an hotel opposite the Gare du Nord, and always had an Australian flag flying from it, and if any of our men were in trouble or difficulties and went to Miss Rout, she would do what she could for us.  She afterwards married Sergeant Hornibrook and is the author of many books written since the War &ndash; on sex and other matters. 
 The last night in Paris we visited the famous Bohemian quarter of Paris. 
 So finished my leave in Paris.,
