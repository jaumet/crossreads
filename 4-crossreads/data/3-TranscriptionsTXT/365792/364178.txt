Apl 8 the next one as she is marked with 8 black crosses on white grounds Only a single hollow canvas plane, beautiful engine, fairly long tail held up by steel supports, 2 pneumatic wheels under the main body - which is of a sort of marked - aluminium, & single seated. The MG is controlled by the propellor blades which it fires past but does not hit. Everything is intact so I guess we wont be long in getting a few Fokkers going. The chap who made the Capture is a "Tommy - Cook", & I believe gets a months leave, & a reward "Lucky devil"
