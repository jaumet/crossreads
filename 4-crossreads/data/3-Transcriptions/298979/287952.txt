<p>to a shovel said, You men have to dig a footpath through this sand hill. Each of the three men blankly refused saying It was a physical impossibility &amp; when hearing of their condition the Sergt said Oh! I dont want men like you! go back &amp; report to the Quartermaster! &amp; he will look after you properly!. This foot path was to be cut so that officers in walking to their bath each morning would not have the bother of walking up a little hill.</p>
<p>The next morning the Sergt Major sent the Sentry to carry rolls of blankets big enough to be a load for two strong men, but the Corporal in charge saw how farcical it was &amp; said. Isn't it awful to think, that a Sergt Major who would send a man in your condition to do work like this, is put in charge of men? Why! he ought to be up in the firing line himself!</p>
<p>The next work was to go with a hand cart to Etaples (the town) for rations.</p>
<p>To get away from such a man as this Sergt Major, the Sentry went on this trip &amp; when he found the man in charge of the party had come across in the same boat &amp; belonged to his Battalion he arranged to stay with his friend.</p>
<p>During these three days owing to these idiotic orders, the Sentry was only able to go to the Hospital once, although his feet were very bad &amp; giving great pain when walking.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, the Sentry was sent for &amp; passed by the board of Doctors being marked to go to Blighty &amp; to be free from all work.</p>
<p>However while waiting for a Hospital Ship to leave he decided to stay &amp; assist his friend thus escaping all parades for duty, roll calls, &amp; parades for meals &amp; having much more freedom &amp; lattitude in every way the time passed pleasantly, besides being able to attend Hospital regularly</p>
<p>After about a week of this, he was paraded with a squad of men "For England" &amp; it was with the very greatest pleasure that he left the Australian base</p>
