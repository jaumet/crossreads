<p>6 &ndash; lost his own brother in the Suvla fight and he himself I think I told you was severely wounded later and came back to Lemnos to another hospital on the other side of the Bay &ndash; he was there 3 weeks before he could get word to me that he was wounded and close by. I think I told you I went to him. His wife got word that he was dead &ndash; poor thing. He is at home now, and writes me occasionally &ndash; is walking about. Most of the men I have met and like are fighting now in France and one just hopes. It seems too appalling that more young life must be sacrificed. I think I better give this letter to Sister Thompson or Col Jamieson to post to you in Sydney as I hear all our letters are to be held up for 6 weeks. Do you think it is true. I feel ashamed of the little I write. But I generally come off duty so fagged that I cant write. I have been exceedingly busy but you know I like it. I have had 112 beds all full for 3 weeks now I have only 80 &ndash; and all in one ward which makes it much easier to control and I only had 63 pts the night before last, now I hope to have less. I must write about my ward work amongst the eye</p>
