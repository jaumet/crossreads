Whilst the men that had already had 21 days leave proceeded again for 16 days on leave of absence and so things proceeded until eventually after every man had received 6 weeks leave the ship was completed with her refit and so onJune 27th  at 4 am we left the basin and was taken out to the stream to anchor and adjust compasses, - we then appeared to be a different ship entirely, - new searchlights together with their platform had been installed, new fire control platform, bridge and very many other things had been installed and renewed - At 6 P.M. we departed from Birkenhead for Scapa Flow to rejoin the Grand Fleet, - weather was beautifully fine but very fresh, and onward we proceeded without incident and onJune 19th  at 1.30 am. we arrived at Scapa Flow and once again took up our previous anchorage, - at 8 am we commenced to fill up our bunkers, The harbourage was as usual simply full up with ships of the Grand Fleet
