<p>7 Sisters only remaining. Transport section those attached to the troopship. Well the Sisters left after much hand shaking &amp; waving of flags. Some even shed tears. The steamer they were transferred on being comfortable yet far inferior to the Indarra. The troops waved until the British India Duniera was out of sight.</p>
<p>Dec 15<br/>The coaling finished having taken on board 1500 tons of coal &amp; 800 tons of water. We departed on another trip after completing 6000 miles or more to Colombo as the distance &amp; tracks are longer than in Peace time. Well we found out after we are bound for The Suez Canal Egypt. The trip being much the same as from Albany to Colombo.<br/>Boat drill occasionally every one appearing with life belts on. Army drill &amp; marches. Marching songs sung. Those troops could sing splendid. Games concerts every night. The Y.M.C.A. found a piano. Yet the Indarra boasts of 6 of her own. This society proved itself very good to the troops. Helping them in every way possible.<br/>Sundays Church Services having a R.C. priest aboard. Church of Eng. minister, Non-conformist &amp; Y.M.C.A. Each one held services in different parts of the ship &amp; each had a good audience &amp; very well patronized. Singing splendid. The meals arranged.
