Tuesday 17 SeptemberLast night a night of incidents.  In a motor ride to C.C.S. at La Chapelete we got lost & went all over the country in moonlight. Fritz bombed the other side of the village (Buire) causing casualties including killed. A most terrific storm flooded me out my place in hut.Fritz shelled the camp area causing us to take refuge in dugouts. The big stunt is for to-morrow & we expect to be very busy. Dummy tanks are to be used to draw fire from the Boshe.
Wednesday 18 SeptemberEarly this morning, after a beautiful barrage, our chaps went over in part of a general attack & advanced about 6 kilos taking 1500 prisoners, 14 field guns & many M.G.s.  Our casualties for the day, 1st Division are 43 & very light.  Belleux & Hargicourt were taken by our brigade.Plenty of work at M.D.S.
