<p>1 August 1915<br/>Sunday</p>
<p>The Turks by doing a little mining on our right not only threatened our works but made enfilading possible by their guns so the 5th Brig &amp; the 5 LH were ordered to go out at 1AM &amp; take the first trench this they did &amp; at the same time inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, they then stormed &amp; took the second trench, this time no resistance was offered, not a Turk showing fight, as the trench could be commanded from the first so we were ordered to retire on the first trench, 60 Turks were counted in &amp; about their trenches our losses were 10 killed &amp; 74 W not too bad considering the nature of the job After lunch we went for our usual then paid a visit to 701 where a fine view was had of a severe bombardment of Achi Baba from all positions, the hills were smothered in dust &amp; our guns were peppering Gaba with shot of all sizes &amp; shapes.  Dobbyns sent away with Influenza to Maidos for a couple days</p>
<p>2 August 1915<br/>Monday 41 wks from home</p>
<p>During the night the Turks launched a heavy counter attack but nothing came of it &amp; our returns were of the liveliest nature although we were content with consolidation only &amp; not of offence, this must have annoyed them for they didn't venture out of the trenches.  We witnessed a great fight between a Taube &amp; a British plane they manoeuvered for a position over the other for an hour &amp; all the while they were chucking shots at one another the Monitor settled it by bringing into use her anti- aircraft gun she only fired two shots when the Taube thought better of the encounter &amp; sailed away over her own lines.  No water, barge either missing or sunk so things are again crook.  A Brig &amp; his staff landed today they belong to the 29th Brig, &amp; also 3 Bn of Gurkas who have gone along to the left flank.  Admitted into hospital with gastro arthritis but nothing of much consequence.</p>
