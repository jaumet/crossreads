<p>Monday<br/>8/2-16</p>
<p>Very nice day &ndash; very cold- Our floating home is rolling &amp; knocking things about. Plenty to eat at the tables. Canteen Day &ndash; unfortunately doing a roaring trade &ndash; took &pound;50 first day of opening &ndash; sell somewhere about 300 lbs of Biscuits &amp; 200 pkts of sweets etc per day.<br/> All men were called together &amp; were lectured by Officers on the necessity of avoiding smoking between Decks on account of Fire, as we are a couple of hundred miles from shore. My Badge &amp;<br/>Stripes obtains for me many concessions in regards to coming &amp; going to any part of the Ship, which is only an Officers privilege &ndash; some times see a little too much.</p>
<p>Tuesday<br/>9/2-16</p>
<p>Very nice day &ndash; windy &ndash; very rough. While at Tea, a huge wave came through the port hole &amp; wet every body in the vicinity, all port holes are closed for the night &ndash; quite a common</p>
