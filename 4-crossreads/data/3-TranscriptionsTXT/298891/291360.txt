4 Thursday
Got up & sat sewing in wind under trees - then Oh Lord the pain.  Caught cold in tissues.  Crept to bed at 3.30.  In fearful pain so that I couldn't move & sister Earl left me till Dr. came round at night.  Suffered all night.  Sheila and Webber insufferably noisy & vulgar.  Sister Davis out of tent so it was like a hyena cage.
