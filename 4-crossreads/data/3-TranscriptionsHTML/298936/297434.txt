<p>October 1915</p>
<p>Tuesday 5</p>
<p>Fatigue duties during the day.</p>
<p>Work hard while it lasts but not regular at present &amp; but not regularly at present from what information I have gained it seems that when a charge is on from Shell Green the track goes down a very steep gully, up a mound in the gully, down &amp; up to the opposite ridge.  Thence it runs through a sap in front of a gun (4.7) &amp; down an incline to the 2nd L.H. I. &amp; [indecipherable] where we leave the patients.</p>
<p>Total distance nearly a mile.</p>
<p>Own Art.have the track</p>
