<p>Sunday 4 April 1915</p>
<p>This morning I took the Holy Communion at a service which was held in the Y.M.C.A. but at 7.30 a.m.  And what a different service it was to that usual boring farce which is held every Sunday and which is labelled "Divine Service".  To-day is the first day that I have communicated since I have been in the force, and I feel very much better for it.  I prayed for my dear little Mater and my dear young brother away in Australia, and for my dear old Dad who is at present away in Japan.  It is just these little religious reminders, the recognition of a Supreme Being, a Star guiding our destinies, that can keep a man straight, especially if you take into consideration the conditions under which the average man now lives &ndash; no restraining parental influences, no refining influences of female society.  And today I agreed with that wise Frenchman who wrote:  "If there were no God, it would be necessary to invent one".</p>
<p>Things were very quiet round camp to-day.  All leave to Cairo, of course, after Good Friday's brawl, has been stopped and officers and men are "confined to barracks".</p>
