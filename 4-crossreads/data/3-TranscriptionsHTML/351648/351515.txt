<p>Seen as many as 3 hundred at a time around here waiting to be removed to ambulance &amp; some of the most ghastly wounds imagineable &amp; yet never a murmur, as long as they have their cigarette they don't seem to worry.  I well remember one man, &amp; I'll never forget him, he had his leg practically blown away, a broken arm, a nasty face wound, I went to attend him, "never mind me Sir, there are others worse than me".  Could you beat it? it is one of the times when I am really glad to be in the A.M.C. for one can do some good, but I'd rather be a combatant anytime.</p>
<p>We live in spasms here by that I mean that the periods of shelling are spasmodic, all the guns will go like the devil for a while, then there will be unbroken quiet for a space, <strike>which</strike> not a wound to disturb the peace, with the sky blue &amp; sun shining, the green trees &amp; fields, the birds singing &amp; everything peaceful, one might be 100 miles from any war, &amp; then all of a sudden well one isn't.  At night things are at their brightest &amp; best, machine guns &amp; rifles (which are generally quiet nearly all day) have full sway, the bullets swish all round this shop.  Thank goodness I've got a good dug out.</p>
<p>Teddy Burchitt is with our Ambulance, a dear good chap he is, of course I knew him before.</p>
<p>There go the guns again on their evening "Strafe", too much noise to write more, thank goodness you'll say, please write again I loved your letter &amp; make those visitors of yours write no matter who they may be, its such an oasis in the desert getting letters here, no matter from whom.</p>
<p>Please give my love to John &amp; the Kid &amp; much of the same for yourself.</p>
<p>Yrs very sincerely<br/>Bill</p>
