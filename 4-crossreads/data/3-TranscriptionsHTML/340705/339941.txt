<p>all enlisted.  I would like to know where Major Susman is &ndash; his Battalion, Brigade etc.  So if you can give me the information, I shall be very glad.</p>
<p>I sent that cable "Eleventh December" etc. from Durrant's Post, before we had definite news of the Evacuation.  If you mentioned the word "well" in your cable, it was necessary to put the date that you were well.  Hence the "eleventh December". It was disappointing to know that the cable was late (due to disorganisation at our quitting), but it got to Sydney in nice time for New Year.</p>
