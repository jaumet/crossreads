<p>French village I have seen.</p>
<p>While at Thiennes we were issued with the latest type of gas helmet, and were put through a gas chamber so we would know what it was like if it came to the real thing. We were also given a demonstration of liquid fire, and issued with goggles to protect us against lachrymatory or tear- gas shells that the Huns were so fond of using.</p>
<p>On April 7th we left Thiennes to go to the trenches. We marched to a village called Outtersteene where we were billeted for the night. The next morning I left the company and went on ahead in a motor bus. There were several others there, and we left the bus at Erquinghem near Armentieres. We then went in small batches in single file to the trenches just in front of Bois Grenier. I had to take over the platoon sector so they'd know where everything was when they came in.</p>
