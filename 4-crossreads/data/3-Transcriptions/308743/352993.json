<p>During the night a most violent thunderstorm came over from the South &amp; our friends on the other side made the most of it by attacking but they only got bad for their pains, Enver Pasha has resumed command of the Turks again &amp; has ordered us off the Peninsula at all costs.  Advanced report from Helles today says that during the last two days the Turks have left 1500 dead on the field &amp; they are getting greatly disheartened their equipment is also of the worst, canvas most of it &amp; some have only slippers for boots.  Met Eric P &amp; went to the beach with him to try &amp; find out about Pere, things are booming again at the Cape &amp; the heavy guns have taken up the music again, a heavy sea has been running all day &amp; has caused some damage amongst the works on the beach  Created a bomb proof shelter over the Signal Office.  Snipers got three this morning.  Only a couple of hundred shells today</p>
