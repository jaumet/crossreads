<p>Colonel Rosy is just as enthusiastic a soldier as ever, and does not spare himself or anyone else till he considers his Brigade is efficient &ndash; By the way, he was asking after you yesterday and wishes to be kindly remembered to you. I don't know whether I mentioned in my letter to Mum that he has had a fortnight in France since he went away sick from Anzac. He tells us everything there was quite up to British thoroughness, but as regards   <strike>the</strike> comparison, he says the Australians have not much to learn in field works or trenches etc.</p>
<p>Since last writing we have had numerous changes in the Brigade. "Bunny" Clowes, who was a subaltern in this Battery with me has gone to Divisional HQ. as Staff Captain, and Eric Vowles is also going shortly as A.D.C to General</p>
