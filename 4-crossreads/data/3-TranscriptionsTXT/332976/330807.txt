 March 1917 7th.   "Eternal Ally" is a sap between "Needle" &amp; "Rose Trenches," in which  is  some time ago, our company made a "deep dugout" of considerable size   We are living in a part of this &amp; with bunks made along the walls (cabin fashion) we are fairly comfortable. This morning I was detailed to take three sappers &amp; work them in shifts of 8 hours each to take charge of infantry fatigues doing work for us, in the nature of carrying material. Our rations are sent down to us daily from "Warterloff Farm" &amp; our water is carried from "Miller's Son," where a well has been dug by No 3 Section.
