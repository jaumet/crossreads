Markomania is now along side the steamer and the crew is taken on board. In the meantime I descent from the searchlight and am called from the bridge by the watch officer :- "Applicant!"  attention" - "prepare yourself to take charge of the next prize crew." 
 I provide myself with prize-papers and writing material, sidearm and pistols.I also put a few dollars in my pocket to buy cigarettes in the mess in case it should be a neutral steamer. 
 It was a Dutch steamer on the way from Rotterdam to Calcutta. She had no contraband on board with the help of my broken Dutch mixed with a little Low german, I carry out my orders and we understand each other quite well.
