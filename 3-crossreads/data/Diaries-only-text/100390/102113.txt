My Dear People
You must forgive the brevity of this note. My hands are badly poisoned with these awful flies. Every [indecipherable] chap has septic sores from these flies. My hands are bandaged up. Its very painful too I can tell you ? the flesh refuses to heal the sore just spreads spreads. God what a nice clean country Australia is after the East. Ill get alright some day its all in the game 
Yours affectionately
Jack
