April 1917Thursday 19The big fightThe biggest battle the 10th ever in lasted all day. 13000 Turks against us. Our casualties very heavy. 98 in our regt.
I had three narrow escapes and was lifted about a foot from the ground by a high explosive shell. Watch saved me from a stomach wound. Got in Wadi Ghuzze and worked back. Here Disher killed Major Hamlin wounded. Saw some Tommies with awful wounds.
