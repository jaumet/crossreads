<p>13 -1 -17<br/> "The Paradise of Fools"</p>
<p>I started on the road of Life with innocent intent<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>The world seemed fair and free from care along its paths I went.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>The pride of mother, father, friends had shown my feet the way<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <br/>And every hour was sunshine and my heart was light &amp; gay</p>
<p>I met some friends who laughed &amp; talked of things I'd not been taught<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br/>And longed to know their pleasure and to hear them call me "Sport"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   <br/>And though they oft used words my dear old father ne"er would say<br/>  <br/>And though I knew 'twas sinning as they spoke from day to day</p>
<p>My ears they grew accustomed and as use makes wrong seem right</p>
