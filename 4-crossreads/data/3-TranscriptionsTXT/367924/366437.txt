 My word we have given Jacko an awful slaping up on this stunt. This country where we are now is full of Olive Trees, they are planted all over the mountain side. Mr. Finlay has not been with the Regiment for three months &amp; a half now, so he missed all this stunt &amp; I think a good job for him too. Jack Norrish has a good job well back from the firing line altogether. 
 The  day  mail came in the day before I left the Regiment but I could not get my letters so goodness only knows when I will get them now, in fact I expect I will loose them chasing me around, but I hope not anyhow. I do not seem as if I can settle down to writing some how or other as the ward is full of patients, some talking &amp; others walking about. 
 I have not seen anything of Ted Crimmon yet, but I believe that he is down at the detail camp, Mr. Debnam is still down there &amp; I hope that they still keep him there, as this would be no place for him moving about like we was. I do not know how long it will be before I get my spell now, but I hope not too long. I will get my Photo taken if it is possible &amp; send you one. 
 Remember me to Dolly &amp; Mabel when you see them, I must drop Doll a line some of these days when I get time. I never got those letters from Birts Wife yet. I think I have only recieved two from her up to date. Well I have no idea where we will be for Xmas but I know where I would like to be. Well I hope that your eyes are alright again. Birts Wife must be suffering a good deal from ill health &amp; worry too
