<p>25th Snowing. Very little is heard from Fritz these days. Five lads are steel chasing here.<br/>26th Raining and cold. Fritz by a 7 day time fuse timed by the clock of the Bapaume Town Hall blew that place up to day at 11.45am. There were only HQ casualties.<br/>27th Cold and rain and sleet. Our artillery is fairly active. Our troops are now approx 10 miles past Bapaume. Cecil Sutton pulled a tooth for Fastue. Gee! it was the funniest act of dentistry ever yet witnessed. Some bombardment in progress.<br/>28th Cold. Business is very quiet. No success re allotment. Wrote to Sylvia. No mail.</p>
