<p>21.10.17<br/>Dear Dad, Mum &amp; George,<br/>I have been so busy this week, that I can only manage one letter for all of You this Time.  Last Tuesday I went to a place called Forant on Duty.  I met Bobby Ball one of the North Steyne Boys on the way.  I came back to Salisbury in the afternoon &amp; went to my "Sarum Home" as usual.  I was in Camp on Wednesday.  But on Thursday afternoon I had to go on Duty to a place called Sutton Veny, near Warminster.  I went to My Friends for the evening, but stayed at a Soldiers Rest at night.  I got to bed at 10.30 pm &amp; although perched on a mattress between two-rows of chairs in a great big Hall, I slept the sleep of the just?  I arose &amp; partook my Breakfast in Time to catch the 7.30 am Great Western Train.  After an Hours train ride &amp; an Hours walk, I arrived at the Camp.  I was witness for a Court Martial.  My case did come on till 2 p.m.  I had dinner &amp; a walk around the Village near bye.  About 3 pm some Officer told me that I would not be wanted.  So off I got back to the Town.  I had 2 Hours wait so I strolled around.  Nothing very grand to see so I had my Tea &amp; got back to the Station.  I arrived back in Salisbury at 6.30 pm, but as I was very tired, I caught the 7pm</p>
