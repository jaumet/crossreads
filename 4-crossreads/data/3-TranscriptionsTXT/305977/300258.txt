We had fried steak for dinner today the first fresh meat for some time.  Gee was wounded in the afternoon.  Had his arm torn about badly.
Thursday 2ndWe had a quiet day.  The 6th sent their first lot of men up to Lone Pine for 48 hours.  It is a fairly warm corner & takes some holding.  The 2nd LH Brigade have been holding it for over 3 weeks now together with the 4th LH who are attached to the 2nd Brigade
