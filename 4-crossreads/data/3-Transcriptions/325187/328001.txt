Went to A.I.F. headquarters &amp; got sick leave 1 month, hope to get it advanced, I leave tomorrow with Dolly for St Anns-on-Sea &amp; will come back &amp; see Laura when she is back in London.<br/>I am writing this waiting for Mr Neill to turn up he asked me here for a weekend, but as I'm off tomorrow I cannot stay- he has been away at Bournemouth.<br/>My Bronchitis is much better &amp; wound quite healed.</p>
