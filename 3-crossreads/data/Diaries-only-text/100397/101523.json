My Dear Mother
Your letter and B.s. with the Photo of the Lily arrived safely a couple of days ago. it is one of the latest I have received. Feb.13th. my letters have been coming along fairly well since I left Eng. I also received another letter from J. will you please thank him for me. I will write him when I get back again for a rest just at present we are busy, and writing is allmost out of the question. We have just come through a fairly lively interview with fritz .. we won the day and hunted him out of another ruined village. he is doing all the damage possible as he is hunted back. blowing the villages up with explosive, and burning parts destroying as many of the ornamental trees along the roads, as possible partly to block Traffic, and I suppose to do away with as much cover as possible, so that he will be able to observe our movements. Yesterday I had a look round for awhile, visited the fritzs Burying ground. they have comandeered a nice plot of land near the village cemetery and their graves are nicely done up and marked with wooden crosses when we attacked The Hun a few nights back I fancy we gave him a bit of a surprise. The resistance he put up was short and sharp while it lasted but he soon broke down and we got him on the run. Before we came up here I met Eric a few times but did not see Jim. he was away for awhile, but I suppose he is back
