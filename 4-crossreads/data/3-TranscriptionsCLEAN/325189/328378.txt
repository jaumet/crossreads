  
 remainder of the day.  Went to the Nile Barrage.  Train journey 161/2 miles 21/2 piastres.  Hired a donkey at the Barrage Station & trotted to the dams.  The gardens are very nice here.  There is a Museum of models showing how the Barrage is worked but unfortunately it was closed as it was G.F.  The Nile Delta commences here & across each arm a dam has been constructed.  The arms are very wide.  The difference in the levels was only very small but still a tremendous lot of water was being held
