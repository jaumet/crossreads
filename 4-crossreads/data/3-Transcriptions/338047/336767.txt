<p>1918<br/>Aug 8<br/>brought a light gun back, and started to shell the tanks. The shells went whizzing through the tall trees bordering the road knocking branches off. He got one tank I think, but he was a very poor shot considering the targets that were offering. Corporal Smith was wounded in the leg by a bullet. He was quite pleased as he had a "wad" of about 900 francs that he had won at poker and wanted to spend. The stretcher bearers had told him previously, that if he got knocked, they would refuse to carry him unless he coughed up the wad, but of course he had to wait there in a shell hole for the Ambulance. As our section went past he called out to us "They didn't get my wad", taping his pocket. We passed some old Tommy hut, but that had been used by our side before the Huns push. There was a second camp that had only the foundation left. While crossing this a Fritz gunner near a hospital on the other side of the gully got one of men in the head. He gave a couple of kicks and lay still. The bearers looked at him</p>
