<p>we were boss of the ground as we are of the air , &amp; the cursed war would soon be over. Our company came up about 11.30 p.m., &amp; the 14th went out. He shelled pretty solidly, &amp; they roared around the trench as they burst, but a miss is as good as a mile. Old Mitchell &amp; I slept in a dugout together, I would have liked a blanket it was pretty cold. Although it is June, the nights are cold, &amp; pity help us next winter. Monday 17 June Breakfast arrived at 3 a.m., such as it was, a drink of tea, which was glorious &amp; put fresh life into one after the night, &amp; a piece of bacon, all fat, not so nice. Slept till 2 p.m. when old Mitchell boiled a mess tin of water, &amp; we had a drink &amp; some bread &amp; jam. I have a tin of chocolate &amp; milk Mone sent. The hot drink was very nice , as we can't get a hot meal till after dark up here, it's not safe to bring it up in daylight, as when we were back in reserve. Just before dark one of our 'planes flew low over Fritz's lines, &amp; I saw the bullets as they flashed from his machine gun, he was firing tracer bullets at the Hun;  they fired machine guns &amp; rifles back at the 'plane, but didn't bring it down.  I was walking along the trench about 10.30 p.m.with my mess tin</p>
