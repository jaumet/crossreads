Thursday 10 October
Another walk round the lower part of the Royal Mile to Holyrood Castle.
Edinburgh is the finest city I have yet been in, a city of liesure, learning refinement. Business is not brisk the Streets are seas of smiling faces. The general opinion of the people I have met is to have no peace until the Germans are thoroughly defeated.

Forth Bridge by a char-a-banc. The drive is very fine indeed the country autumn colouring in the trees are glorious. The Bridge impressed me very much is a tremendous structure. "Fair Warmer" this evening.
