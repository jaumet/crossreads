<p>Fri. 31st May<br/>A dire calamity occurred today.   We are each cook and scullion of the mess in turn for a whole day each;  we are at liberty to engage our own orderly to wash dishes etc from among the Italian or Russians.</p>
<p>George today after dinner handed our Family Plate (3 chipped enamel basins &amp; 3 tin spoons) to an Italian to wash and prompty forgot them.</p>
<p>The Plate, alas!, returned no more and we are reduced to using saucepan lids. as eating utensils.</p>
<p>Captain Mowatt and his wireless operator (McGrath) of the C.P.R. liner "Medora" arrived today after 24 days in a sub.   I earned the benedictions of the Captain (a pious but very decent chap) by doing the "ministering-angel" act with a tin of cocoa.</p>
<p>We take Mac into our Mess.</p>
<p>Sun. 2nd June.<br/>In our once-more brushed and garnished uniforms with borrowed accessories Mc &amp; I go to Mass;   the little Italian priest officiating.</p>
