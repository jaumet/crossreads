23 July 1916
Sunday 
All day the battle raged with furious intensity. Artillery on both sides shrieked roared. High explosives shrapnel. Not a yard of ground that was not torn rent. Hairbreadth escapes were our portion every hour! The words of that grand hymn, Jesus lover of my soul. continually was thro? my mind --- "Other refuge have I none hangs my helpless soul on Thee", Cover my defenceless head with the shadow of Thy wing. A merciful Providence protected me from all harm.
Incident on our journey to 4th Batt. Stretcher bearers patient, whiz-bang concussion pitched me headlong into dugout on top of dead German return ? another explosion, duck, piece just misses my head buries itself into the earth instead of my back. Lost watch
