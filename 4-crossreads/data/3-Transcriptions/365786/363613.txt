<p>[Press cutting]<br/>Red Cross Work<br/>S.M.H. Herald 4.xi.15</p>
<p>The Red Cross ladies gathered in large force at their club-rooms, 255A George-street, yesterday afternoon, to hear an account of the work in Egypt from Mrs. Read, wife of Dr. Read, who recently returned from Egypt, after spending three months there.  And it was an intensely interesting story.</p>
<p>After hearing Mrs. Read, one was the better able to understand the difficulties which confronted the Red Cross Society in those first days of the fighting at the Dardanelles and the return of our wounded to Egypt.  The wounded had much to bear on the transports which brought them back from Gallipoli owing to the lack of comforts on board and the unexpectedly heavy casualties;  and they had much to put up with also on their return to Egypt. There were Red Cross stores in plenty, but, owing to faulty organisation, they could not be got when they were urgently wanted.  They were "locked up somewhere in Alexandria," with the result that the wounded at Cairo, though lacking no necessaries, could not secure the comforts that were intended for them.  That was the position in the early days, and it would have been worse had it not been for the formation of the Australian Comforts Fund in Cairo and the splendid work it did.  So many wounded arrived that, at the Palace Hotel at Heliopolis, which had been turned into a military hospital, every corner was occupied, and beds had to be improvised even on the chutes of the scenic railway adjoining.  Even the tennis courts were covered over and made ready for similar use, but fortunately there were not required for this purpose.</p>
<p>The position, however, had now improved vastly, said Mrs. Read, and the men's needs were being ministered to in every possible way.  The arrival of Mr. Adrian Knox and Mr. Norman Brookes had had the result of effecting a complete transformation.  It was work that required the brains and business methods of men.  The women were required to go on working at home, and if the Red Cross of Australia were to do no more than half of what it had already done it would do exceedingly well.  But she believed that it intended to do more than ever.  She heard of girls who desired to go to Egypt to render assistance, but, except in the case of trained nurses, her advice to them was to stay at home, where they could be of more use.</p>
<p>Mrs. Read said that the work of the Red Cross of Australia, now that it had been properly organised, had excited the admiration of the people in Egypt.  It was a matter for some pride that the whole of the motor ambulances used in Egypt had been supplied by the Australian Red Cross Society.</p>
<p>"Much has been said about mutilations by the Turks," said Mrs. Read, "but my husband and I were unable to find one authentic case.  On the other hand, we had plenty of evidence to the contrary.  For instance, some of our more venturesome men proceeded into the interior after the landing a good deal farther than they ought to have done.  Many of them were killed, and their bodies were found afterwards.  Not only was there no sign of their having been mutilated, but the Turks had made little piles of the identification discs and of the personal effects of the men, and left them there to await the advance of our soldiers.  So that our experience of the Turk, after all, is that he is not as bad as he is sometimes painted."</p>
<p>Mrs. Read added that our wounded men could find no praise too great for the work of the heroic stretcher-bearers.</p>
<p>A hearty vote of thanks was accorded Mrs. Read, on the motion of Mrs. Alfred Lee, seconded by Mrs. Pickburn.</p>
