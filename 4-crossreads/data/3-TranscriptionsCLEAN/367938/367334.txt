  
 Bivouac at Popes Anzac. 21.7.15 - 
 - - - - - It has been impossible to write much lately & will have to rely on former good  resolution  reputation. If I enlarge on it it will only be a tirade on heat & flies - practically impossible to do any thing except just climb through one's necessary work. All more or less sick you know - & - its too hard to explain. - the flies are like a few  hives  acres of overturned beehives. 
 I was awfully pleased with two parcels which came at their right times - Please thank everyone. Con's handkerchiefs a good sort - socks not wanted yet as my others do not quite stand up straight yet when taken off - Thank Lola. Did I tell you the soap was surrounded by a gaping crowd who all walked up to & smelt it. Have only used soap about 4 times between May 12 & July 21st. The milk tablets am trying to keep for our advance - they will be better than anything. Thank Margaret & Phil for the Lucy Hinton - Everything almost in use. 
 Also had parcels from Cairo - groceries - so have really done much better lately & am fairly strong. Our M.O. now is Pietro. 
 Your letters so interesting - the life being so deadly dull. It is not expected to be so much longer. Have just come off the hill & so have not washed in salt water for a week, wish to walk to the beach after dark.
