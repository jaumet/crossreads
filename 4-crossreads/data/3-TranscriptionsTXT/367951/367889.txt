Dear AlmaJust a line hoping you are all well as it leaves me at present. Well Alma mum tells me you are boss of the roost but i think you will have your work cut out to be boss over Chris i think he will be having a bit of his own way especialy now that you have shifted to the Glebe but you tell mum to be sure and keep you all away from the trams i wish you had not shifted down till i had come home because i keep thinking that some of you might get hurt with trams.Give Best love to All from your ever loving Dad
Kisses for All xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
