  
 weeks but Reg Keirle is going well at a Camp away on the other end of the Plains. 
 I guess you'll have lots of good fun when Dave Niness gets Home.  He'll be able to tell you all sorts of things.  He was with us on most of our jaunts & can tell you about Auntie. 
 Now, Dad, I must go for a while & when I come back I'll scribble a line to George.  I hope you are all well.  Kind Regards to Otto. 
 Your Loving Son Harry
