<p>This morning we cleaned up our billet for we are expecting to leave for Sailly to-night. As I write our gunners are blazing away at a Taube which has crossed our lines &amp; is making for Sailly, this is the first one I have seen come so far over since I have been here. Last night the mail closed for Australia &amp; there was a fair swag.<br/>19th. To-day is the first anniversary of the great Turkish attack on us at Anzac,  this day last year we were getting a bit of our own back, by nightfall we had slaughtered no less than 7000 Turks &amp; taught them a very severe lesson. I wonder where I shall be this time next year; daisy pushing perhap's, or if my luck still sticks to me home in Australia for I dont think the war will last another year at any rate</p>
