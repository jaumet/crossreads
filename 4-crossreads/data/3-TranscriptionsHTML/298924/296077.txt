<p>Saturday 5 April 1919<br/>I do hope Joe can meet Dolly in case I do go on to Sydney &ndash; if I do go Sydney will send Dolly's luggage by Permanent Weight &amp; direct to D'quin &amp; if Dolly does not wait but goes home with Joe, send a wire to C/- Wilkinson &amp; Lavender, Sydney, then I would not go Melbourne.<br/>Love, Frank.</p>
