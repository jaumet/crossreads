on a marvellous vaudeville show. Would be considered first class anywhere. They have a female impersonator who absolutely beats the world. A regular Hussy. A Juggler they put on was very nearly as good as Cinquevalle. The "Anzac Coves" havent got a hope with them.
Sunday 24.2   Sent letter to Hugo yesterday. The Rum issue has been cut out. Application for Paris leave today. I seen General Holme's (4th Div) grave today. He is buried at No2 C.C.S. His grave is marked by a plain white wooden Cross 4"x2" stuff. There is a rumor that one Battalion in each brigade A.I.F. is to be cut out to reinforce the other three. The extinction of the A.I.E.F. in France has commenced.
It is a curious fact that most of the A.I.F are better dressed here (when out of the line) than they were at home. I know I had never so much & such good clothing as at present. If a man is at all untidy the M.Ps xx  pull him up quick & lively. By the way the Tommy M.P.s bagged me without a pass in Steenwerck yesterday. I not only got out of it but talked my way into the village as well
Tuesday 26.2 Fritz strafing that observation Baloon again this morning as usual. It had to be pulled down. He has got an awfull "set" on this Baloon. Puts some very heavy shrapnel at it. We can hear the screech of the fragments quite plainly. I would'nt be the observer for any price.
