Villa Camp (XII.c.)
18/2/17 A dull grey day. Everyone fairly comfortable in tents and a few out on fatigue in daytime, the rest at night. Fixed up an ammunition bomb dump on new platform in a dry place. Big guns round here shake the huts at every turn. After lunch the padre had an excellent church service with a fair attendance of chaps. Stewart went to Brigade H.Q. for lunch and returned here about 3 p.m. Message arrived Dooley promoted to Major. At afternoon tea Bean drove up in his motor and came in for a yarn. It developed into a long story as he filled a note book with the tale of our doings at Pozieres as supplied by Stewart and Rodda, the sole survivors of the whole battle front start to finish. What a story of bloodshed and pain it is. He stayed to tea and for a long time after and had enough material for some chapters in the book he hopes to write someday. Dooley returned from Baizieux to where he had marched about 500 reinforcements for more training. Bed midnight
