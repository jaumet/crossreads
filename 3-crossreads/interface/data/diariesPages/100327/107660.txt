Quiet night after their outburst Did not sleep again after carry on. Brighter around about 0800. Turks did attack a new trench of ours on the right of us last night but we beat them off. Attack was only a short section of the nature of a sortie. The flares, rockets and other illuminations last night made the scene as bright as day. 
The morning sea calm and the smoke rising listlessly straight up from the funnels of the warships lying in Suvla Bay. 
1030 A lovely warm sunny morning craggy Samothrace showing up frowningly. Went up to B8 with telescope and could see Turks working away at their sandbags under cover and some sitting in the sun on the slopes enjoying the warmth. Talking to Curnow Thomsen found them digging into their dugout. Arranged with to go down to beach this afternoon. C.O. busy with an orderly room Roberts "A" Co alleged asleep on his post and a Cpl. (mg) of 24th when on  rations of water drank the reserve water used for water jacket. Great neglect hope he goes up for it 
26th Batt down in valley still. Haze coming up over Suvla in distance. Artillery quiet. During the afternoon some big shells landed hereabouts and came closer to headquarters than ever one beauty landing close beside sig's office on slope just in front sending clouds of dirt and rubbish up into the air shaking a few out of their graves in the process. Another followed immediately and a few more down the gully, 75's also whizzing round, Met Craig and then took shelter in the Dressing station for a while
