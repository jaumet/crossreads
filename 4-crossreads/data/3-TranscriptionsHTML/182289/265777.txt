<p>Beecham &ndash; 12.10.17<br/>sent to Group Commander of Levi Cott, who ordered the battery to stand by and advance if the situation permitted.  Later when it became clear that our Infantry had not got beyond the Blue Line, the battery was ordered back to its original position, and to prepare to put down a defensive barrage.  Definite information was not received until the afternoon whereby a new barrage line could not be fixed.  The batteries remained as a defensive barrage at their old position.</p>
<p>13.10.17<br/>Guns had now taken up defensive position and the day was spent in improving and consolidating.  An order was received from D.M.G.O. that half the guns could be withdrawn &ndash; four guns from each battery were therefore removed.</p>
<p>14.10.17<br/>The day was again spent in improving the positions.  This was very difficult owing to continued rain, and a large amount of soakage in digging any depth.  Several men were evacuated sick this day.  A supply of dry socks was sent up with rations.</p>
<p>15.10.17<br/>Nos. 1 &amp; 4 Sections relieved No. 2 &amp; 3.  The positions were subjected to shell fire throughout</p>
