<p>Nov 21st [1914]  at 6 A.M. after a most beautiful voyage across the Arabian Sea, we arrived at Aden and where we found HMS "Gloucester" laying at anchor, - of course we all had to eagerly gaze at the "Gloucester" because this ship was famous for having chased the large German Battle Cruiser "Goeben" into Dardanelles for safety &ndash; it seemed most amusing to think such a small vessel as she was, could perform such a great deed and how it reflects on German prowess &amp; patriotism  -  We commenced to coal as soon as we anchored at at 6 PM Gloucester departed en route for Gibraltar</p>
<p>Nov 22nd  at 1.30 AM we finished coaling and at 6 AM we weighed anchor and left at 14 Knots for Port Said, - weather was still fine and sea smooth.  At 4.30 P.M. we passed</p>
