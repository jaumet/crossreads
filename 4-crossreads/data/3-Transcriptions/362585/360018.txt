<p>28.6.17</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Ferguson,</p>
<p>I have parcel containing this letter card.  Thank you so much.  The Butter Scotch was particularly welcome.</p>
<p>I got a letter from Keith dated 20.6.17.  He appeared to be doing well &amp; had just been informed that he was labelled "Australia".  He was complaining I, of course, was delighted to hear it.  I should not think there was a ship strong enough to bring him away again once you get him well into your clutches.</p>
<p>I had a note from Blue Hunter from a hospital in Egypt.  I had hopes that he might put in an appearance at our field ambulance here.</p>
<p>Walter Macallum seems to be doing very good work on the staff.  I saw him tearing through the village here in a car a day or two ago, but could not speak to  him.</p>
<p>We are having quite a good time here &amp; the best of health.</p>
<p>Best Love<br/>Affectionately yours<br/>C.R. Lucas</p>
