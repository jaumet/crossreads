<p>The train journey from Marsailles is just magnificent nature just runs wild &ndash; The hard work of man has made it more pleasing to the eye in the shape of fine buildings &amp; a very fine railway. &ndash; I think <strike>I</strike> one may find scenery &amp; country to equal, but not to excel. About 1700 men on the train, so not much comfort, can just move &ndash; had about an hours sort of sleep &ndash; Cleared up towards midday. At a Village called Advancette, situated in a valley &amp; immediately in rear is a huge straight faced mountain &amp; on a ledge near the top are built 3 large Crucifixes &amp; can be seen a great distance away &ndash; on another ledge I saw a Statue of the Blessed Lady. 29/6/16  Thursday &amp; Friday</p>
<p>Going some all night. My eyes are sore from trying to see too much of this lovely Southern France. Lovely roads trees planted both sides. Poplars, Plain &amp; Fir trees. Had breakfast at 9-30 am at Nuit Sous Ravi&egrave;res &ndash; Dinner at Macon 2 pm &ndash; while waiting at Advancette we heard &amp; whistle &amp; something flew along, it was the Paris Express travelling at the rate of between 60 &amp; 80 miles per hour. Laroche is a very important Junction &amp; somewhere about 100 Engines</p>
