the pouring rain, over we went with German machine guns tearing great gaps in our lines and then half way across No Mans Land we were up to our armpits in water, through it we ploughed the machine guns still taking their toll.  But it was too much, we were beaten back.  Three times we tried but the task was hopeless and at last we gave it up.At dawn I stood a mile behind the line seeing my Company through to Delville Wood, men, listlessly dragging their feet behind them, with the grey pallor and staring eyes of sheer fatigue passed me by unseeingly.  It was weird, uncanny they were sound asleep to all around them quite unconscious just moving by instinct not picking their way, just stumbling along through rough and smooth alike.  What's the use anyway?
