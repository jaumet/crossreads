<p>Clugie have not come to tea so far.</p>
<p>Thursday  2<br/>Sports again today. Otherwise uneventfull. A few nights ago some of the 18th decided that some of their men had not been bathing enough. And they were taken up by force &amp; given a shower. Of course things went a bit too far &amp; clean men were ducked for fun Since then they have been paraided to the shower Treevers for tea tonight &amp; one Padre came down for a time afterwards. Treevers is trying hard to get the swearing cut out, its an uphill job as there are so many boys in the 17th &amp; 18 Batlns. A canvas ventilator has been put in</p>
