<p>Sunday Sep 24<br/>We are having sports on the grounds to day &amp; the weather has fined up for the occasion. They start at 1 oclock &amp; there many events such as throwing the cricket ball, kicking the fball, foot, obsticle &amp; relay races &amp; all brought of with great dispatch. No time wasted as in Australian sports so the time does not drag.</p>
<p>The new OC had charge &amp; had a good chance to show off his smartness. Then we also had a dress parade. Review order.</p>
<p>Monday Sep 25th<br/>Things again normal</p>
<p>2 German Fokkers sailed overhead on observation but got a very warm reception being peppered by Antiaircraft guns.</p>
<p>Weather is keeping very fine but inclined to be close and oppressive.</p>
<p>There was another football match this afternoon. I did not go.</p>
<p>Tuesday Sep 26<br/>Air craft very plentiful and much firing at them with the a.a. guns. There was also a battle in the air &amp; our plains persued the enemy over the lines.</p>
