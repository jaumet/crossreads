We have difficulti this way as one cant alway carri one thing about in onship rig , the spirit of comradeship ? the Esprit de corp ? of our armi is so fine that noth is safe from the sneak thief and the casual pilfer . While on this tack we wonder would peopl ever give to war fund if they could see the misus scoundrel that goe on . One of our chap bought a box of chocol from store today insid was a note from the ladi donor an address . He paid 1/6 for this lot ? it was onli intend for some wound man in hospit . Sever case of good ? pyjama , dress gown , hospit slipper sock , white shirt , rug , washer towel were broken up to-day hand out to abl bodi men who fanci them . It was in no way a case of need ? just that the good were handi the men had recent been paid . Thus , while the peopl respons could make good fellow of themselv by give away the unwant stuff they could also grow richer by charg small sum for the most use articl Incident the canteen be short of everyth , price for such thing as are yet in stock have been rais about 200 . We ask where doe all this cash go to ? . A soldier can buy anyth but his discharg ? at a price , but he often wonder who make the profit . Hell will be overcrowd with Militari administr chariti Committe ! Our advic to the women who want to help the soldier : Dont wast your time money work to make rich for a lot of rogu ? send what you want to send direct to those you know or those someon els know will tell you of .

Weather clearer , but still showeri with indic of fog . N.Z. ship hove alongsid this afternoon take in tucker . Dont know how they are fare , but they must be pretti short of ration on some of the ship . Inform that everyth possibl will be done to give us someth decent to eat for dinner tomorrow . Of cours none of the transport were expect to be still at sea by Dec. so no Xmas provis aboard . 25th Xmas Day . They found some cocoa somewher manag to give us a weak unsweeten decoct with a slice of bacon each a roll . Quit a pleasant chang for breakfast . Dinner consist of a slice of pork each , a spud , tin cabbag , roll plum duff ? plenti of latter . O.C. troop made a sort of speech to the Port Lincoln machin gunner . Compliment us on the way we settl down to condit on this ship , deepli sympathis with us as " shipwreck soldier who , own home have gone bung , were forc into cramp quarter of a strang ship . Regard us as guest of the Ulyss had decid to use the balanc of Ulyss sport fund to present each of us with a packet of Three Castl cigarett " a few odd and end from Canteen ( now close ) . He conclud by read Georg V 's messag to soldier , sailor , inform us that not onli was it not forseen that we should be so long on voyag , but , have been within an ace of go under the sea in coffin full of porthol , we would not be un-nerv by the inform that we are still much closer to the sea bed than to England ! If luck continu with the ?hungri six ? we might expect to reach some port unknown by Wednesday , 27th inst when our troubl would commenc . Advise us candid to take a last good look at the sun enjoy it to the full , as we might not see him again for a consider period . " Where you come from they regist rainfal ? where you are go they onli take notic of interv of sunlight . " Pass from fog to fog all day with burst of weak sunlight . Dont feel the cold ? but then we are all done up like bale of wool . All "blue " hand over on to-day parad to be dump . The dump consist of pile the abandon cloth in a hatch then look out to sea ( offic ) while crew down on the deck duck off with them to their own quarter . When you hear of the militari dump ?blue ? at sea toward end of voyag ? wink onc let it pass . Today a curious coincid came my way . Sit on deck after dinner notic a cobber with life belt on which letter C.G.P. ( print ) caught my eye . It[seem like Charli 's write , therefor , I got hold of the belt ? swap my own , - and examin it . "CGP " appear in coupl of place , but insid the letter were written "CGP " underneath in what look like anoth handwrit , C.G. Price . Look as this belt was Char properti on voyag to Franc ? a number of belt on this ship are from other transport , therefor it is strang if his found it way to myself in in the jumbl of transfer from ship to ship . Afternoon even travel dead slow zig-zag . Stop all night . 26th Repack kit equip . Order to do away with superflu kit ? No man to land with more than one kit bag .

We hit the speed up for the first time for day are now make good time with the TBD 's line astern . More fail us .( 1 ) We receiv two blanket prior to dis-embark ... all we get in Dear old Blighti . Our O.C. told us he expect we ?d freez hard long befor due for Franc , but he ca n't help it . It appear that old Blighti 's children need more blanket than we do . They feel the cold so , poor dear . ( 2 ) We land in the west , in fog etc , possibl spend some time in a Depot befor join camp . This mean we must take ration with us from the ship ! ( 3 ) . We will be due for 5 back pay 6 day leav or settl down ? but Australian are not allow loos in England beyond certain limit ? which do not includ ani big place of interest , especi London . This latter bit of news we can hard credit . They ?d hard have the nerv to put the kybosh on us to that extent , although I must admit that Australia 's record in S Africa , West Africa Franc would be good excus for them to bar us altogeth from their town home ....if it were not that they re not much better them-selv . ( There are plenti with us to judg by ) . Weather still wet foggi , But cold not as bad as expect . I feel no colder than I ve often been in Sydney we re close to Snow now Format dure past week
