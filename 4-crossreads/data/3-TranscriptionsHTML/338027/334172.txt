<p>Friday, 30 April, 1915<br/>Exercised horses again.</p>
<p>Reports say that the Aust &amp; British are doing wonderfully well at the Dardanelles, having gained over 20 miles.  Wounded arrived all day it is a wonderful service they utilise the tram lines to run the train on right up to the hospital.</p>
<p>About 10 p.m when all were in bed, a cry was heard "17 volunteers wanted to reinforce at the Dardanelles".  Ever man rushed down to the officer so they had to draw for it and 17 [indecipherable] that is no-care sort of beggars got it, they were packing until 12 at night, we helping them.</p>
<p>Saturday, 1 May, 1915<br/>Transport came for the lucky 17 at 5.30 a.m. and we all turned out to give them a hearty send off although we were [indecipherable] we gave them three hearty cheers and wishes for luck.</p>
<p>More wounded arrived to-day including Col Elliot (Pompey) and a lot of well known of their officers.  Two Brigadiers were reported killed.  They all sing the praises of  the Australians &amp; say that they are poor soldiers but they can fight.  The Turk does not like a bayonet charge of [indecipherable] Aust.</p>
<p>Went to O'Rs at night, 3rd time this week they are delighted with the success of the Australians.</p>
