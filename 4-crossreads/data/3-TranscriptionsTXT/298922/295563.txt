 Nowell is staying here for a few days he is better &amp; I've seen a good deal of him. He is a philosopher &amp; the Orient has entered his soul a good deal. Have decided to go to Alexandria tomorrow so will post this with some snapshots I have had printed. My last information is NO BOAT for a week.  Love to you all, Frank.
