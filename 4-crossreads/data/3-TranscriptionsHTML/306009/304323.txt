<p>1915<br/>May. 17 Mon.<br/>Not much work to do &ndash; the new place appears to be run much more on system than Mena. Spent some time in straightening up the office which is pretty untidy.<br/>1st Cairo B-P Scouts meet every Monday, Wednesday  &amp; Friday at their headquarters &ndash; attended their meeting to-night &amp; spent a very decent time there with "Snow" Freeman (Private, No. 2 G.H.). One of the Asst. S.Ms. shewed us the Troop printing outfit &amp; Carpenter's Bench and room they are fitting up as gymnasium.<br/>The food we get at Gezira could not be better &amp; we have a native to wait on us for 6 piastres a head per month.<br/>Am sleeping upon the 1st floor in an empty room on a wicker bedstead with mattress &amp; pillow (the latter a Kyarra souvenir) &ndash; Very Kumfee!</p>
