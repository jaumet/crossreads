May, 1915Monday 17Today drew money to pay 150 Seyces, they are an idle illiterate lot of degenerates. All over Cairo, walking about are wounded men showing that the Cooks Tourists as some kind people call us are not always Toy Soldiers. Personally I am very fit the hot weather agrees with me.Posted notes yesterday & hope they reach you safely you will see by dates the sequence & if any are mislaid.
