     Ma'adi Egypt stamp at top of page                         of the opportunity, & in our spare time did a bit of it.  We came upon one place about 10' X 6 which we followed down to a depth of about 12 feet.    Then we came upon a slab of stone much the same as our kerbing stone about 6 X 5 by 4 inches thick.  We were able to shift this but were disappointed to find nothing but sand under it.  At one end we noticed a drive leading off, which we followed out up, & after digging sufficient earth away I crawled in on my stomach & with the light of a candle I found myself in a cave affair about 8 feet across.  In one corner was a complete set of bones, so old that they crumbled to ashes between the fingers.  Beside them were the remains of an animal's jaw bone & skull, as though the favourite cat or dog had been buried with him.  It was here that I found these beads at least some of them, & the balance I got after scraping round the edge of some other gravesSome other chaps have got some fine things out of them- one got a beautiful scarab, another an alabaster doll & basin.Must close now, with best love to you & MotherYour loving son,Leo.
