  
 Sept had our packs up & it was quite a hot morning. The roads are very good for marching but a bit hard. In many places they are only just wide enough in many places to march in fours. That is supposed to be 10 ft. Had a very large dinner & then went for a walk with Baker about 3 miles extra for fun 
 Sunday 16 Church Paraide 
 Monday 17th Picked for Guard today & had a very easy job going through Guard duities all day. Was chosen as best dressed man when the Guard was mounted so got off quite pleased as it is a wet night.
