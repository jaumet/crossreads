  
 On board the R.M.S. "Orontes" 9th July 
 My dear Ferguson 
 Thanks for yr. v. kind letter.  It gave me great pleasure - for I look on you as one of the really inner circle of friends of my heart. 
 If I get off now, or go to Egypt later I'll hunt up yr. boy as a matter of course.  Unless Evil befall the [indecipherable] now I'll [indecipherable] and go on straight to England.  The ship is a good one but 111 nurses and 26 Doctors are perils beyond those of the sea [?].  Most of us a v seasick - (a S.W. gale and a head sea).  All good wishes. 
 Yrs. v sincerely R.S.S. [R Scot Skirving] I also am ready to feed the fishes - [indecipherable] have done so - but not audibly thank goodness.
