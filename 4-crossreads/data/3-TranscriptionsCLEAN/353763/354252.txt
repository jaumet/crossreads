  
 for they never seem to evince any feeling about their calling & I doubt very much if the loss of AE1 affected any of them mentally  -  Navy chaps are educated to obey orders - both men & officers - without question - but there they part - the men are trained to obey but the officers to think & have initiative & to do the right thing when isolated  -  The men trust their officers implicitly in almost every case  - 
 Thursday Oct 22 - The Parramatta Capt Warren is alongside  -  Bumped on the mud & has a diver down  -  She's nearly as long as we are & her top deck is full of war contraptions - torpedo tubes - loaded  - guns - 4 in number - Turbine engines & 3 screws & can steam close on  30 knots per hour  -  She's a nasty looking customer at any time  -  Destroyers attack at night by choice - Submarines by day  -  Which is the deadlier engine of war I don't know  -  The submarine is far stealthier -  so you see we have AE2 on one side & a destroyer on the other side of us & we'r all well & as jolly as sandboys & Suva feels quite well too - now  -
