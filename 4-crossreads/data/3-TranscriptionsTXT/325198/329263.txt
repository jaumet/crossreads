 6 March, 1916 Serapeum It has been hot to day but thank goodness the wind has dropped so one can go about in comfort without having one's eyes filled up with sand.  I heard Joe Woods say the other night to dig for him at the stone out side the tent if he could not be found in the morning.  I did not go out on parade to day, was on forage fatigue instead &amp; I had a very easy day of it  After dinner I managed to wash out a couple of shirts &amp; a towel, its hard to get any washing done in this place  The chaps spend nearly every night playing bridge, they take up the whole tent &amp; a chap cannot make his bed down or any thing  Heard rumours that we would be going to France shortly, I think its all moonshine
