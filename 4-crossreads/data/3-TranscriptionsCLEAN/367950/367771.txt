on account of the bright moonlight.The Regiment is parading at 3.15 pm this afternoon to proceed to Sheikh Zowond they will bivouac there for several hours then pack up and go on at 1.30 pm [9th] and be in position at daylight and engage The Turks the idea is to try and capture Rafa and then return to El Arish. They may have a bigger job than they bargained for. I am excused duty so I am not going and if they have a time like the last stint out that way I am thankful am not going in my present state of health at any rate I may be sent away sick yet shall see how things are by tomorrow. Had another aeroplane scare today but he did not come too close the guns got on to him and I believe he was hit. He disappeared very quickly 2 of our machines chasing him.Captain Franklin and about a dozen men just arrived from Moasvar and they are going out straight away with the regiment rather sudden order that.
