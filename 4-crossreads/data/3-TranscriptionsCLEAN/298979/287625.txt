  
 most enjoyable anywhere. The painful bed "cases" would always be the first to urge on "Jock" to create a "diversion" Some mornings when "Sunbeam" was intent on defending "Jolly" from every charge imaginable the Ward would be just like "bedlam". 
 The work of the Sisters & VADs was, here also, most praiseworthy, care & kindness & the most wonderful patience were shown continuously 
 One incident was noticeable. 
 One of the VADs was on duty one afternoon when only bed patients were left in the Ward & one young fellow who evidently was in a peevish mood called for that girl to fix his bed, move his pillow etc, at least six times in half an hour till at last his near neighbour had to call to him to stop. The VAD came up smiling every time, without a murmur, & when told by the other patients to take no further notice, she said she did not mind a bit. All the same the other men growled at such needless annoyance, just because the man was a bit irritable. However when the others growled he did not call for the VAD again. 
 At this Hospital all cases able to walk were allowed out from 2 Oclock till 6.30 and on Friday nights were allowed to go to the Theatre (free). One picture show was always free to wounded soldiers between certain hours in the afternoon and a Soldiers Club admitted all, in uniform, where light refreshments could be obtained for a nominal sum. 
 The appearance of Australians amongst the wounded men walking about the streets created quite a lot of notice & not one instance occurred but that each one of them was pressed to go to tea with people who would rush up & speak to them. Twice a shilling was placed in the hand of a wounded soldier standing talking to a friend. Coming up from behind a passer by would place a shilling in the soldiers hand & hurry on forward, the soldier turning quickly would not realize who had done it till 20 yards, ahead, he would see a hurrying figure
