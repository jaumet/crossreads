 Sat 24th The sea very choppy; medical examination.  sighted a boat away on the starboard, supposed to be a convoy. concert after tea but not not a very great success 
 Sun 25th Sig Cobcroft lobbed in guard room for refusing to get out at stables but was released immediately through our S.M. on account of Cobcroft being on the bridge during the night, Major Vernon conducted the Church Service as there was no parson on board,  the sea still choppy & the sky cloudy but no rain. 
 Mon 26th Came alongside one of our cruisers & sailed into the harbor at King Georges Sound at breakfast time.  there are 22 boats here & they looked very pretty as we came in.  are waiting for the Clan McCorkadale to catch up.  raining a treat..
