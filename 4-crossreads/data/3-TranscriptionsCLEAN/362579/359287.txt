  
 A great success. 
 If you feel inclined to send me any cakes, pack it in a tin   &  address to Miss Conyers. We do not get many cakes now, but still have    Sweets   sent to us. Our boys (M. Officers) are awfully good to us   &  everytime they go on busy to any little village try to bring us Chocolates or cakes. We really are a happy unit but a busy one. 
 Heaps of love and kisses. Tell my friends not to forget me. 
 From yours lovingly Edith
