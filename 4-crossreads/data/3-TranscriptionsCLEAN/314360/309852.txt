13th Feb TuesdayMy birthday, fine day but cold, went and see another doctor, marked me fit would not give you any say in the matter, had a very light morning of it, poor dinner, went over to YM after dinner.
14th February WedIn morning went out on drill, this is one of the worst camps that I have been in, absolutely no management. I went and had guard drill from 3 - 4 pm and then went back to huts for a starvation tea. This camp is supposed to be a training camp like the Bull Ring at Etaples but its nearly all guards and piquets.
