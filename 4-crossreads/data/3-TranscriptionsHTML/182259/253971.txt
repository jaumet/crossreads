<p>London, and had our lecture at Horsferry Road Head Quaters,all one had time to do was look for lodgings.</p>
<p>13th &nbsp; I went with a drag ?diag party from the YMCA to all the princpal places of London, such as Westminster Abbey, St Marys, Albert Hall , Tower of London, The Royal Stables.&nbsp; The trip cost 4/- per man, but it was far the best way to see the sights, and we had rather an interesting day. The Albert Hall was beautifull inside all the seats circular except a square center. The Royal Stalls were fine. The Hall was where madam Melba used to sing before Royal Parties. The Albert Memorial opposite is well worthy of mention. It represents sculptors of all parts of the world, and it is a great piece of work. The tower of London is very interesting ,There they have a full collection of all the old weapons of war, the crown jewels, execution block, prison towers and the tower where the two princessis&nbsp; were murdered , one cannot help but notice the thickness of the stone walls. But what appealed most to me was the visit to the Royal Stables; The horses looked beautifull and groomed to perfection. The coronation carriage is very large and fancy with gold mountings. We finished the evening oat the play call the Boy&#39;e which put a good finish to the days outing.</p>
<p>14th We went out to Woolwich to see the damages done by the big explosion at the munition factory, and it was hard to find a sound window within a radius..................</p>
