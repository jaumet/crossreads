<p>and we sail on the Navua at 3.30 pm change money on board into English &amp; settle down for the voyage  weather good poor accomedation for men 800 odd on a ship of 2,900 Tons</p>
<p>Next day.  <br/>Weather good so far &amp; good Ki Ki for the Troops, in Touch with Eastern by Wireless</p>
<p>Sunday [Feb 7th]<br/>weather still good no church services but have life belts on &amp; stand to stations, the steward in my cabin was on the Empress of Ireland when she was run down by another ship &amp; sank he told me he took time &amp; put his life belt on properly &amp; right up tight under the arms, I have a pistol loaded &amp; given to me &amp; on the alarm sounding I have to keep everybody rushing the life boats as we have only room for about 400 men &amp; we are over 800 &amp; have orders to kill if anybody rushes the boats</p>
<p>Monday<br/>the weather is rather rough &amp; some of the boys are looking green &amp; are rather quiet  wonder why ?</p>
<p>Tuesday<br/>Weather worse the Navua is a splendid sea boat she does not roll a bit, but she mounts a wave &amp; seems to halt for a minute &amp; then dives down, a most pleasing feeling, then she mounts another &amp; does the same     she is slow now only doing 7 knots as the propellor is out of the water half the time</p>
