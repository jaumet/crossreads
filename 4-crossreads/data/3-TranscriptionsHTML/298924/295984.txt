<p>Thursday, 2 January 1919<br/>Posted notes yesterday.  New Year passed all right after all, a good deal more talk than anything else.  Officers Mess Tent was cut down last month &amp; a drunken <u>Corporal</u> tried to get men to raid it.  We drill over the old Rafa Battlefield but it is hard to recognize country again.  Big engine shed, Water Towers &amp; a [indecipherable] Beersheba Railway came in on the old line of Trenches.  We have had the wooden crosses repainted &amp; an officer &amp; men have gone to Gallipoli to do the same thing there.  Frank Chase &amp; Trooper in 6th L.H. came over for a year last night.  His brother Lyle died of pneumonia.</p>
