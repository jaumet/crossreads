<p>Aussie away today one to Rush St. and the other to young Claire McMahon.</p>
<p>Wednesday 10?/4  Entrained at Castre at midday after a march in <u>Heavy</u> marching order. We are rather packed. 40 in a truck, we travelled via  <strike>Lillers B</strike>  Hazebrouck, Lillers, Bethune, Doullens, Domart, to Vignacourt arriving near midnight. We then spent about 1&frac12; Hours floundering around in the mud everything pitch dark. A guide was provided to lead us to Billets , but he lost us &amp; himself also. He was called every possible variety of B---- that we could think of &amp; getting a bit nervous He finally slipped off in the darkness &amp; left us, our N.C.Os finally landed us in a Stable &amp; all was peace.</p>
<p><strike>We are now at V</strike> Stayed at Vignacourt about one &amp; a half days. Left there this morning in Battle Order and done a "Toot Sweet" march of 15.4 Kilos before 12 noon we were then taken on some Lorries to Querrieu, Had some Bully &amp; Biscuits then I was set on (with others) building a Cook house. The first salute we got was two Bombs from a Fritz plane. I finished the day very tired &amp; footsore. There are persistent tales of Tommies evacuating positions. One Transport officer said that they threw away their Rifles &amp; Equipment and got when Fritz was fully 9 Kilos away. I can hardly believe it. It is also rumored that he has  <strike>broken</strike>  gained some ground at La Bassee. By Gee there are</p>
