September 1915
Friday 10
Nothing to do all day but early parade.  The camp on the beach is simply lovely & a bath [indecipherable] handy. Any amount of Tommies about - Dublin Fusiliers, [indecipherable] & various[indecipherable].
Met a Dulwich College old boy who remembered Clifford Hill but not my old friend Leslie Hills of Sr. Olams.
The [indecipherable] of the bay is simply lovely.
