 not the slightest chanc of win . I ll bet they will get cut to piec . The first news came through yesterday from that it appear they had broken through at Bullecourt Lagnicourt 1 or 2 more place but that signifi noth for there is never ani troubl for either side to make the first advanc for they have all their gun regist on the trench the front line is alway light held , wait till they get up against the line of resist have to haul their gun over shell torn ground get them into posit for the next push then the fun start , we know all about that from person experi as for man to man goe everi Australian know who is the superior fighter , that has been test too often the Fritzi know it in their own heart too well
