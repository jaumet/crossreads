 Ricochet. We passed close to the Cocos Keeling, and it seemed a pity we could not run over and have a look at the Emden. One of the boys on board is making his second attempt to get to the front and was with the 40 original transports whom the "Sydney" was convoying when she demolished the Emden. He described how she swung out from the line, almost hidden from view in her own smoke, and how a Japanese cruiser an hour later leapt right across the line of transports, and with one sweep of her guns trained them all on a speck that appeared on the horizon where the Sydney had disappeared. It must have been a stirring time.

From the point of view of defence, I should think that Aden has potentialities of a Gibraltar. We gradually came in view of the town, and drew up to a buoy in full view of it, and not more than &frac12; a mile distance from the shore. It is a quaint town. The buildings are of course of the common Arab type, square, the average one of a very fair size, and of a
