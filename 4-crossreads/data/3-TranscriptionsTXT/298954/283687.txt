 We sailed out across the river &amp; through the woods to Gorden, a pretty little village wherein is situated "zum Waldesruh'", an inn simple and Germanic where beer may be obtained together with coffee ersatz &amp; where Tellier amused us with the piano.   A cosy and comfy afternoon. 
 Arrived back for dinner at 6.30 p (Dear old Burgess had dug up some spuds &amp; baked 'em with bully beef,) and then I had to rush away to my histrionic labours at the "Hip". 
 Fri. 8th Nov. Events are moving rapidly.   The Emperor Karl has abdicated &amp; an armistice has been granted Austria.   Our long-delayed move takes place on Monday (events permitting.) Geo. Whittaker, Smith. go to Schweidnitz. Ted and old Freestone (of Fryatt's ship, the "Brussels") go to Wanbeck, another party &amp; myself (as R.S.T.) goes to Clausthal in the Hartz Mountains. (where Captn's Saunders &amp; Donaldson are.)
