<p>Saturday 12 January<br/>Pay day.  Nothing to report. An old fashioned picture show to-night at Y.M.C.A., pictures I saw ten years ago. "Padres" in the army in the field are a force and we have not seen one for over a year.</p>
<p>Sunday 13 January<br/>Beautiful fine day &amp; a walk to Ballieul this afternoon. Nothing at all of interest.<br/>For about an hour I watched the 'planes landing, rising and stunting over the 'drome at Ballieul.  The more I see of the machines the more I marvel at them.</p>
