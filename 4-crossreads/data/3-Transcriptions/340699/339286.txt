<p>belong to a French ultramarine-blue-blooded nobleman and they match well with his breeding; being noble and magnificent as can be. From so many points there are the finest, great avenues; converging on the chateau, or feeding or running at right angles to each other; avenues like the Observatoire, from the fountain to the Luxembourg; and no limit to the number of them. Where we sat down for our symposium, there were growing among the grass and weeds and wild flowers, quantities of "quat' saisons" (strawberries) and as we listened to the talk we plucked and them. The old marquis and marquise, a dowdy old couple, came along. She was evidently very deaf, for he pulled her up and with his mouth close to her ear bawled "On m'a dit quil n'y a pas d'oeufs &aacute; Paris!!!" and on her making an interrogative sound and gesture he yelled: "Point d'oeufs!!!! --- &aacute; Pari!!!!!!""  "Ah, oui" said the marquise (who was of Lady Courtney's type); but I bet she didn't comprehend. Anyway she had the serenity of the deaf and probably didn't care if she missed what her lord had to say; and this time it wasn't much.</p>
<p>St Gratien, France<br/>7/7/18.<br/>I have done very little to-day. Last night I had very bad sleep on account of the indigestion, so this morning I merely fooled round, beat my blankets, washed some things straightened up my ''works" and material and read a little of Wells' "Mr. Polly'. which is good. After lunch your two welcome post-cards telling of having seen Lindsay and Dyson came along; for which many thanks. Later I got to work on an already started portrait of our D.A.Q.M.G. who is a man of great physical splendour, and though the day has been a languorous one and he sleepy and I washed out, I improved it considerably. After ten I went to see the M.0. and explained my condition. He proved very considerate and has prescribed for me and ordered special diet, so that I stand a good chance of getting on my legs again. Tonight I am going round to see Leist and after that to bed early; this time to sleep decently, I hope. I wrote to A to-day for some tips for I want to make a success of this camouflage job of mine. So much hangs to it. I hope he's able soon</p>
