  
 the 2nd Regiment killing two horses & wounding one man slightly - so that he can still walk but not sit down.  Our A.A. guns had arrived from the Train just in time to greet them & by bad luck the shell cases fell all around us & some of us had narrow squeaks from being hit by our own empty shell cases. It was a replica of the throwbacks of the bombs we used to get every evening at Quinns Post so was more used to it than most, though it was very unpleasant.  The stunt to Rafa is at last realty coming off tomorrow evening I think.  As far as I can gather it is two days, Anzac Mt. Div. on one flank, 5th Mt. Yeomanry Div. on another flank & Infantry frontal attack plus five batteries of artillery.  There will be something doing all right.
