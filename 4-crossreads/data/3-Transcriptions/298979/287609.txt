<p>looking at his arm would want to "operate" on it, but the patient could relate, that three of the best Doctors had examined it.</p>
<p>Every patient in a ward is known by the number of his bed and hanging on a nail over his head is his "Medical History Sheet", giving all his particulars when &amp; where the wounds were received detailed particulars of the wounds &amp; the treatment necessary. One portion of this sheet is a chart upon which is marked twice a day the movements of his pulse &amp; temperature. Taking the latter seems to more important.</p>
<p>This Sheet was not hung over the head of the "Sentry" for which the Sister &amp; Nurses would give no reason.</p>
<p>On the morning of the second day the Sentry having had a good lone, pleasant sleep at once made an effort to get up &amp; put on his suit of "blues", the clothing provided for wounded men, but was immediately sh-o-o-ed to bed again by the Sister in a good humoured but very firm manner. However about eleven o'clock when both Sister &amp; Nurses went off for morning tea, the Sentry quickly got into his blues &amp; made an excursion outside the marquee, but soon after getting into the open air, the whole camp seemed to start whirling round, &amp; he commenced staggering about just like a drunken man, till a friendly "pal" rushed up to his assistance, when he again became steady &amp; with help walked along for a short distance &amp; enjoyed the outing.</p>
<p>This was done each morning for eight or nine days, with only one recurrence of the "staggering" conditions, but on this occasion the help was absolutely necessary &amp; the sentry had to sit for quite 15 minutes to "collect" himself.</p>
<p>During one morning after this time, one of the Nurses just after taking the Sentry's temperature gave quite a deep sigh of relief &amp; when asked for an explanation the sentry was told he was just coming back to "normal".</p>
