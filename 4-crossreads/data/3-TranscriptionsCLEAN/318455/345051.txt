last night & finish up at 5 p.m. tonight
Oct 12It is just getting dusk as we are running into Port Said having had a smooth calm & uneventful journey
Oct 13We did not disembark last night as expected, but this morning the British Troops have been getting off & the Ship is we believe taking us on to Kantara this afternoon (kantara = E1Qantara on Suez Canal)
We shall be glad to get off for she is a Hungry Ship. We have sent in complaints & the only effect was to have some rigmarole read out about being on "Lines of Communication Scale
