<p>So I let fly.  I fed the blaze with faggots &ndash;<br/>Hinted that on the whole we liked the Hun &ndash;<br/>Roughed out a sketch of charnel-heaps and maggots &ndash;<br/>The side of war that isn't sport nor fun;<br/>Flung a few phrases chosen from the camps<br/>At itch-struck females dashing about in cars<br/>To pose in sketchy frills at snide bazaars &ndash;<br/>At fat old profiteers and statesmen's ramps &ndash;<br/>Oh, yes!  I piled it on.  He loathed the pill,<br/>And barged his way out, rosy round the gill.</p>
<p>But was the swine half-right?  It sounds like bliss<br/>To sleep serene o'nights without surmise<br/>Of S.O.S. lights screaming to the skies,<br/>Deep in the warmth of Blighty out of this &ndash;<br/>It sounds like bliss to forget the dug-out's reeking<br/>The bitter fog in the eyes;  the life on a thread,<br/>The crazed crescendo of the mortars seeking<br/>Half-callous living and the unheeding dead,<br/>And drowse in everlasting furloughs, under<br/>The placid roofs of peace-time.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder!<br/>If we get through it &ndash; if the Immortals choose<br/>To grant a span again, when this be ended,<br/>Of ordered life, impenetrably fended<br/>By small restraints and sanctions and taboos &ndash;<br/>Shall the recovered cares and leisures grip<br/>The flabbier soul, or shall desire return<br/>Back to the dug-out's care-free comradeship<br/>And battle-time's magnificent unconcern<br/>For dim to-morrow?  Shall we find, once more,<br/>Peace has its surfeits too as well as War?</p>
<p>Not the drab shadows only we'll remember,<br/>But all the colour there was &ndash; the browns and blues<br/>Down the deep shaft of Flemish avenues;<br/>The swaying harvests gold-drenched with September;<br/>And frosty mornings in the Spring retreat<br/>When the scrap opened out, and it was good<br/>To choose a gun-park in the greening wheat<br/>And pitch a hidden tent in Holnon Wood &ndash;<br/>Jimmy, old son, it made the pulses dance<br/>To see those Devon daffodils in France!</p>
<p>We shall recall the eager clank and jingle<br/>Of gun-teams on the pave, moving South,<br/>The long off-saddle in the mid-day drouth,<br/>"Feed" in the cowslips by the wayside dingle;<br/>The journey's welcome end amid the cool<br/>Clutter of sun-warmed barns and straggling pines;<br/>The urgent fuss around the wagon-lines;<br/>Sweat-roughened horses drinking at the pool &ndash;<br/>And then the morning start, with head-chains ringing<br/>Swinging along at ease, the drivers' singing . . .</p>
<p>And moments better still, I thank the gods<br/>For one white, perfect hour at Conteville,<br/>With Boches massing on the nearer hill,<br/>And open sights as near as makes no odds.<br/>Young grant was with us then.  The boy was daft,<br/>Blind to snipers, yelling like the damned:<br/>Young Grant was with us then.  The boy was daft,<br/>Of three-rounds-gunfire.  Then left section jammed,<br/>And back the buzzers' private signal rolled:<br/>Sweat on it, chum!  We've got the bastards cold!</p>
<p>Such memories blaze their imprint under the traces<br/>Of darker records on the palimpsest.<br/>The blacker the time the deeper bites the zest<br/>Of sudden sunshine on the open spaces.<br/>There's a rough justice fingering the scale<br/>Where greater guerdons risk the longer price &ndash;<br/>Hazard your neck, and savour your cakes and ale &ndash;<br/>Seek Eden-fruit, and stake your Paradise.<br/>For though smooth road's good going, Jim &ndash; a kiss<br/>Snatched at the edge of Hell is tenfold bliss.</p>
<p>One thing is sure.  This crazy round-about<br/>Destroys the introspective attitude.<br/>Action uproots the dreamy Hamlet-mood,<br/>And blithely cuts the yellow throat of Doubt.<br/>Your job is clear before you, catalogued<br/>From dawn to dawn.  You cannot miss the greens,<br/>Slice as you will &ndash; the fairway lies undogged<br/>By furtive may-be-sos and might-have-beens &ndash;<br/>Flank unto flank no hesitation ghosts<br/>The crude commands of Corps Direction-Posts.</p>
<p>Leave it at that, then.  On your toes, old son!<br/>Still with a grin for plagues we can't abolish &ndash;<br/>The super-fatted Staff;  the wily Hun;<br/>The Army's tribal god of Spit-and-Polish.<br/>Blight seize 'em all!</p>
<p>I'll wander now and borrow<br/>A couple of blankets from the R.T.O.,<br/>You can doss down with me an hour or so.<br/>We'll trek together to the guns to-morrow.<br/>Finish your swipes, old Jimmy, while you can &ndash;<br/>Walk &ndash; March!  The blooming ride!  Bonne chance,<br/>Suzanne!</p>
<p>L.M. Hastings.</p>
