 Engineers Camp Enoggera Oct. 29th 1916 
 To the Trustees of the Brisbane Museum 
 Dear Sirs 
 Prior to my departure for the front I should like to present my valuable and exceedingly rare collection of cheque Harris Tweed clothes to the Brisbane Museum. 
 I realise that it is only a question of time when "Round the World with a Pencil" and The bob portrait business will belong to the past, and the necessary "clobber" a rarity which well deserves being stuffed and shown in a glass case to your good natured and much caricatured public. 
 Believe me Yours truly Sapper Vasco late of the "S.S. Koopa"
