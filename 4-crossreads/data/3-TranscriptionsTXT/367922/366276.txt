16.office. I broke down hopelessly & as always the splendid lads in my stretcher-squad did the very best for me.
Believe me dear friend your letter was a great help & comfort to me & if you can all forgive my poor reply, do write when possible. I am most thankful of Mrs Fry's dear letter, & Dorothy's, enclosing the pretty photo of Hazel & her dear wee one, & the group Wilga enclosed of you all. I carry them with me always & look at them very often. Will try & write them very soon.
I am thinking of you all with such truly loving thoughts & if, & when I return you will help to soften the agony of the emptiness of little Mothers absence. With all love & deep thankfulness for your interest in me.
Ever your loving friend,Ellis
