 Selifkeh which run veri close to the beach ) After a good rest on the sand enjoy the cool sea breez we decid to find this creek near the old ruin which our Greek friend had recommend us to find , as there was good hide . So we start to walk along just in from the beach so that we would leav no mark . We had to go veri cautious as we had been warn that the beach was patrol by Turkish soldier so often . Howev about nidnight we came on the old ruin a few stone pillar stand about 30 feet high the remaind be just a mass of broken stone . We then knew we could not be far off the creek where we intend make our headquart . About 1 p.m. we came to the creek . About 300 yard from the beach there was plenti of underground for hide and half a dozen sapl which we thought would come in to make a raft , it be our intent , if unabl to sight a ship to make a raft , put to sea at night in the hope of be pick up . We were onli 60 [120 m . ] from the island of Cyprus and we heard that our patrol ship frequent came in close to that part of the coast . Howev we were not satisfi to stop where we were . We want to see if there was anyth better on the other side of the creek . We were make our way out toward the beach when two arm sentri pass just in front of us . We fell down behind a bush , and were not seen . We kept our eye on these sentri and saw them cross over the entranc of this creek on what appear to be a bridg , but next day we could see that the entranc of this creek was block across with stone . The water from the creek filter through these stone into the sea , so farm a path across . After see these two sentri we decid to go back to where we first struck the creek . We soon found a good hide place right on the edg of the creek . From here we look out through the reed down the creek and out to sea . When daylight came we were look out when we saw two Turkish Soldier . One was have a bath and the other was pray ( the Mahommeden are veri strict on their prayer night and morn ) Their rifl were lie on the ground . We knew then that this part of the beach must be strict guard . We spent the day rest . About 8 p.m. we start to cut the small tree down to make a raft . After about an hour hard work with a saw about 1 foot long , we manag to cut one of the tree through and lower it down without make much nois . The second one was larger and took about two hour . As we were care lower it down it took charg of us and fell into the water make a great splash . We remain veri quiet for some time . Nobodi seem to be about , so we haul it under cover . We thought we had done a fair night work so lay down to sleep. In the morn we cut the branch off the two tree it be our intent to make bundl of the branch to tie under the raft to make it more buoyant . That night we cut down three small tree in the same manner as the night befor . The follow day we cut the branch off
