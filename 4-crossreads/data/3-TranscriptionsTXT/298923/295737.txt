 12 March 1918 Tuesday On Outpost in a Cave.  Raining all day.  Can see Jacko's fires in front, he is jumpy &amp; fires flares &amp; bombs at intervals- Rather worried over my little wife she has seen a Doctor, who says a prambulator will be necessary in 6 months so the little girl wants to go to her Mother if I cannot get a Base job   I hardly like to ask for it but would take it quickly- for the little girls sake- We have been successful in our stunt here as the papers will tell you-   She has written &amp; told you Mother.
