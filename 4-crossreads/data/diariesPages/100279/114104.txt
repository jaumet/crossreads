were no prouder people today in France than the Australians as he said justly so, he also said that the Commander in Chief had sent a cable to Australia congratulating Australia on the great victory which had fallen to her troops, it was worth all the hardships losses to have the honor of taking Baupaume, even though it was not heavily garrisoned, the boys had to fight pretty hard for it, I should like to be in Australia when they get the news I guess they will be pleased, but no more than we are Ill bet.
