<p>in France too during the last few weeks.  By the accounts we get through the papers the fighting is very severe over there now and I am watching the accounts every morning with great interest. That is where I just came from before getting my ankle injured or rather just a couple of miles to the right that is, of Bullecourt, where our Australians are again right in the stiffest part.

So far I have had no letters since coming to hospital but am expecting them along any day now, we have a very nice lady who comes round every day and looks after the interests of all the Australians here and brings us any little thing we may need.  Owing to the scarcity of petrol we do not go for motor drives as was the custom until a few weeks ago, the English people in general seem to be feeling the pinch of war a bit now.  I despatched a couple of cable grams to dad a few days ago to let you know I was OK did the military let you know of my injury. The last cable was for money mother</p>
