<p>unheard of thing,  what a thing to ask men to do.</p>
<p>It is very hot today &amp; I have got a lovely burn on my arm.</p>
<p>About a week ago we sent a message by wireless to Colombo asking the authorities there if they could arrange a trip to "Kandy" for 500 men  we got our reply yesterday saying that they could fix things provided the Military in Colombo were agreeable, they have taken the name of all those desirous of going, I put my name in &amp; chanced whether they stop it or not over our "Port Said affair,"</p>
<p>We were paid again yesterday &amp; no sooner had they got their money than "two up" started, so this morning the C.O. reminded them on parade about the "orders" respecting this Australian pastime &amp;</p>
