<p>Victoria Hotel, Damascus<br/>June 14th 1919</p>
<p>Dear Major Greenwood</p>
<p>I propose visiting Amman where I am told you are a big power in the land.</p>
<p>My work here should be completed within the next 4 days and I strike out for your country with two other ranks, two tin Lizzies &amp; many pleasant anticipations of meeting you again.</p>
<p>From Amman I go to E. Salt &amp; then back into the swelter of Cairo.</p>
<p>Hoping to be fortunate enough to find you.</p>
<p>Yours Ever</p>
<p>G.W. Lambert (Capt.)<br/>Official Artist, A.I.F.</p>
<p>Please forgive omission of your correct title &amp; Decorations which I have forgotten, they must be on the increase.</p>
