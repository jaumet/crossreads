<p>Flessells 17/12/16  Breakfast at 5.30 am.  Cold and dark. At 6.45 said farewell to Madame and Georgette and we marched down to the Flessells station &ndash; the whole brigade turned out.  The 21st Batt. looked well with very neat packs.  Ours were anyhow and, to my disgust the QM reported quite a lot of blankets and other stores dumped.  after a fairly long wait at the station which we spent in walking up and down, the D.A.Q.M.G.informed us that Anzac had forgotten to order the train!  So all ranks turned round and went back to billets where the good people were very glad to see us.  Georgette gave another lecon francais but the poor little devil being full on olfractory considerations forced it be concluded soon.  A born coquette.  At 1.30 received orders to move at once to station.  Some billets being 10 minutes away it was 2pm before we moved off.  On arrival RSO and other people were quite excited as time was short but took no notice of them.  Had a few words with RS upon the same subject but the storm blew over soon.  Entrainment well done. (Before lunch paraded all officers and delivered some very caustic and bitter remarks to them regarding slack turnout and carelessness re government property.  One or two flinched at biting remarks for temper lent point to remarks!)  Train moved off about 3 and we had a good journey via Amiens to Edgehill. Here we got out and marched to Ribemont.  Many troops on the move.  The guns could be plainly heard.  A 3 kilometre march along broad roads and found fair billets.  The men had hot tea on cookers for them.  The men are mostly in good bunks of wire netting in barns etc.  Retired late.  A cowshed is adjoining my bedroom!</p>
