<p>4th Battalion<br/>A.I.F.<br/>22.VI.15<br/>Gallipoli</p>
<p>Dear Judge,</p>
<p>Very many thanks for your letter.  It was most good of you to write and letters are such a Godsend to us here.  You must please excuse the scrap of paper &ndash; but notepaper is very scarce here now.  I am afraid there is no chance of intercepting your letter to MacLaurin.  I have only recently returned from Hospital.  MacLaurin was killed on April 27 &amp; his letters are not now delivered here.</p>
<p>We are all very sick here at the way you are being deluded with the casualty lists in Australia.  The fighting commenced at dawn on April 15 &amp; in the first 2 days the Australian &amp; N.Z. casualties were in the neighbourhood of 5000 - &amp; by May 10 &ndash; 8000 &ndash; yet according to the Sydney files just to hand of May 15, you have been informed of some 1800.</p>
<p>Personally I only had 36 hours of it, &amp; during that time managed to stop a shrapnel bullet on the top of the head (only a graze) &ndash; the nose of a shrapnel shell on my jaw &amp; a bullet in the side, which luckily went through, &amp; my lungs healed up in 3 days.  The number of fine men who have gone is pitiable.  The first boatload ashore of the 1st Brigade contained the following Officers, MacLaurin, Onslow Thompson, Irvine, Smith, Anderson, Massie, King &amp; self.  The first four named are dead, King &amp; self wounded, Anderson &amp; Massie have not yet been plugged.  MacLaurin was shot in the head by a sniper &ndash; he lived a little over an hour, but never regained consciousness.  My Colonel, Irvine &amp; Smith were shot dead.  And so it is right through the Division.  My Battalion has had 20 casualties among the officers, &amp; we have been one of the lucky ones.</p>
