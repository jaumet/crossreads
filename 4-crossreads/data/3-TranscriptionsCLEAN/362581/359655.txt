France 3.6.17
My darling Eddy,I have a Candian Officer - A Flying Corp one in my ward. He was shot by the wicked Huns but is doing well   &  was able to bring his machine to the land safely, also in our own part. We see lots of Planes   &  Torbs [Taubes] flying about, but don't like them when they get busy. Heaps of love   &  kisses. Hope you enjoyed Auntie Etta's birthday.  From Auntie Eadle.
