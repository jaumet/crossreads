<p>granted so intend to apply at once.  Our team was beaten today in the Division final for Australian Rules.  Decided to give the lads a good New Year so arranged for a concert, card tournament &amp; dance to be held on the night of 31st.  Will also put on a good supper so they should do well.</p>
<p>Tuesday 31st Dec.   A very successful day.  We managed to get a piano for the dance and I had a lot of sandwiches prepared putting on for the supper biscuits as well with Coffee and nip of Rum, besides a 100 litre barrel of beer.  The fun started at about 6 P.M. the cards being neglected for the sake of the dancing which the lads enjoyed every bit as much as if girls were present.  At 8.30 I issued out the rum &amp; the whole crowd had a wonderful glow up inside 5 minutes &amp; carried on the good fun until the New Year.  At 9 P.M. I left for our own celebration in the mess</p>
