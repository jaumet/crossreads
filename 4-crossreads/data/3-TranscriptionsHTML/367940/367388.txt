<p>I was still knocking about the country.</p>
<p>Have you yet settled on a house and has mother decided to furnish it. I suppose you will still remain at K. P. [Kangaroo Point] there is no doubt it is the best part of Brisbane. Let me know all about what you are doing when you write again as I like to hear. Will you send me Aunt Christies address I have not the faintest idea what it is so cannot write to her. Tell Dad I shall be sending him some papers per this mail, all English of course, I have sent out a few French ones but I suppose poor old Dad will look over his specks at them. How is everybody keeping all well I hope.</p>
<p>I have a bit of a credit saved upon my pay book and am now looking forward to a bit of leave but so far there has not been the slightest whisper about it, we have had 4 months of it now so reckon there should be something doing in the leave line soon.</p>
<p>Well dear Tess I am just about exhausted for news so I must perforce draw to a close<br/>I trust all are well and in the best of health. Remember me to Mary Butcher, I suppose she will</p>
