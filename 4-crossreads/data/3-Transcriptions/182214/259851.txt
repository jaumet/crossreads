<p>We got leave to go to Ferry post once a week for a bathe but Scotty &amp; I used to go in every sunday after dinner so we only go half a day &amp; moreover we had to walk 12 miles back again as there were not anything running on the light railway &nbsp;we enjoyed these trips &amp; generally visited the A.I.F. canteen &amp; have a feed of tin fruit &amp; biscuits we also saw big Transports going through the canal full of English troops going to Mespotamia &amp; other places abroad, they would cheer us &amp; clap their hands the Australians would do the same. We had a quiet time till Anzac day when we had a glorious feed. I say this with full permission of the men who have always claimed it as the best feed.</p>
