<p>8th Jan As per usual raining. Plenty to do, to get camp in order. Convey returned safely, though many animals were bogged in shell holes.<br/>9th Raining  &amp; intolerably cold. More men march in. Fritz was very quiet all day as were our artillery. No casualties.  8pm our artillery is going some. Gee I shall be glad when this show is finished, though I am of firm opinion that it will end by June.<br/>10th Very cold, but fine. While convoy was going to Flers, a German flew over our line in a captured British plane. However he did no damage. Our artillery opened out a bombardment about 8 pm</p>
