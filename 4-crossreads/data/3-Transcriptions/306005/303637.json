<p>8-12-16<br/>large Army expected there within a week so things look like a lively time ahead. Put in the time this afternoon on the observation post. A parcel mail arrived today but will not be sorted till tomorrow. Patrol, escort parties etc. are detailed daily here &amp; the Outpost work at night  but it practically the same routine daily.</p>
<p>9-12-16+<br/>Sat 9th<br/>Had no luck with parcel mail today but the limber was sent over to Kilo 127 again this afternoon &amp; returned with a couple of bags of letters &amp; papers. Reports tonight state that enemy are busy &amp; for patrols to El Aabash to be careful. An enemy 'plane flew over us today very high</p>
