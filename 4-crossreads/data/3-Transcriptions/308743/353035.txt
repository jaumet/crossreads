<p>22 September 1915<br/>Wednesday 58 wks of soldiering</p>
<p>Getting along splendidly now &amp; gaining strength daily, the submarine parent ship arrived today along with her 5 puppies one of which went for a trip up the Narrows, 2 boatloads of the French left by paddle steamer for Cape Hellas One of our fever patients was operated on for the removal of a shrapnel pellet which has been in his shoulder for weeks he came through OK.  Lord Nelson got steam up &amp; went for a short spin but has since returned, the other units of the Navy have been very quiet The Turk prisoners have been busy blasting all day &amp; making new roads along the fore-shore, Four more troopers arrived laden with troops &amp; 3 left at dusk for somewhere Weather has turned very cold &amp; squally &amp; on the Peninsular things must be getting on the cool side.  Our advance on the Left is confirmed &amp; our troops are now in Bifuk Anaparta &amp; well over further on the Left, our Right still holds the same positions</p>
<p>23 September 1915<br/>Thursday</p>
<p>Had only a fair to middling night &amp; temperature was slightly on the rise, the day itself has been anything but pleasant, squally &amp; windy not without a touch of winter either.  News very scarce at present only a few troopers coming &amp; going Hospital ships also on the move Navy doing nothing as usual.  French soldiers still going away by the boatload to the Cape &amp; more troops are continually coming in from Home, Two of our submarines have been manoeuvering for hours preparatory to going up the Dardanelles,  the French submarines are like their ships stay in the Harbour a trifle too dangerous for them outside This is the last day of the 12 months of diary This day twelve months ago we were preparing to go on board the Karroo to sail for somewhere, what a change as the daily accounts previous to this will reveal I wonder if this time next year I will be keeping a diary I hope so at home</p>
