26/12/17 Kortepyp Ploegsteert
stretchers and covered with blankets. One was a circular shapeless mass the poor chap must have been well smashed up. A sad Xmas. for somebody. All the undergrowth of the woods was deeply snowcovered but the sun was shining faintly. Called in at a Y.M.C.A dugout and had some cocoa and then went ahead round Hyde Park corner, still going through the wood, to Advanced Estaminet where we sat down and consulted maps. Now along a road to an artillery O.P. but it came on to snow and very little could be seen from there. Crossed over the old German front line and saw some of our mine craters ? one pillbox had been blown up entire. We then went along a railway or tramline under direct observation from Warneton tower and while there was an airfight on overhead big shells were bursting aimlessly in the snow.
