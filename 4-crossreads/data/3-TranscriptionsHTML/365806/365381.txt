<p>2<br/>as to that base R.C. Dago Strickland.  Ive attended professionally every govenor (save Beauchamp) in NSW since Lrd Carringtons time &ndash; and this is the only one I labelled "impossible meticulous idiot".  (Beauchamp was the two cuds and the [indecipherable] of a fool but not as prone for evil as this ass).  I saw him the day he took office and his talk then about the Labour party &ndash; and his own tragic domestic menage, so disgusted me that I made up my mind to wriggle out of having them as patienti &ndash; and I did so &ndash; I hope the miserable moola will be recalled.  So far as I see the time Ill have to return to NSW in April &ndash; to loneliness and a dislocated perspective of life &ndash; I dread it &ndash; but it seems my duty &ndash; and I suppose I'll stick it somehow &ndash; Anyway its a better climate &ndash; and this winter is fairly cooling us all &ndash; we are all more or less sickly.</p>
