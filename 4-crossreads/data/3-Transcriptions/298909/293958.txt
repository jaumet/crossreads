<p>Dusty &ndash; but rather cool. Corporal of a picquet all day. Read a lot all day. Wrote a few letters at night. The Orderly Corporal today instead of having his sick parade at Dispensary at at 5.30 am, was a bit late &amp; the Medical Officer point blank refused to see some 50 men, who were sick, that meant they can get no redress till 5.30 am next day.</p>
