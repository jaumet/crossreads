  
 Oct 31st :- Awake early preparing for departure. Final breakfast was best we had on board. About 8-30 am we hauled up anchor  &  put into Suez (Port) Tewfik arriving about 9 am &  the first companies disembarked. We now had to carry the sick ashore   Niggers were here swimming all around the boat &  diving for money. The port is a very clean & industrious place. At 12-30 pm we entrained &  were off. As we  passed through Suez one was struck with the filth &  squalor of the place. Animals, fowls etc live in the houses with the people themselves  The buildings are oriental style, square & flat roofs, some crumbling  The Indians are camped all along the line to Cairo &  we were cheering them as we passed. Stopped at several small stations, where we bought dates &  fruit of all descriptions, Tel-el-Kebir being on our route.
