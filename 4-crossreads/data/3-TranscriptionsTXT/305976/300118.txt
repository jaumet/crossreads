of money it is to commission a full Troopship to go from Adelaide to Hobart for 16 passengers. The climate the one day we were here was beautifully fresh & invigorating. We left Tasmania the following day for Melbourne. The trip was uneventful & we anchored just inside Port Phillip heads. The Victorians were taken to quarantine by lighter & we proceeded to Sydney.Next day we were steaming up the New South Wales coast. I recognised the various places along the coast. We entered Sydney Harbour about 10.30 AM on the morning of April
