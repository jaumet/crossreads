<p>potatoes, onions, ham, jam, biscuits, lime juice, vegetables, Fresh meat rum tobacco cigarettes and matches, so you see we are not doing badly at all. I suppose Fred has arrived home by now, it is the best thing they could have done with Fred, he could never have stood with what we had to do the first five days, no such things as sleep for these first five days but as reinforcements kept coming we were relieved for a couple of days. I may just as well tell you that I was slightly wounded on the 30th April, I was hit in the leg with a piece of Shrapnel, however I did not feel bad enough to knock, so I kept going ever since, although the wound in my leg is big enough for me to put the middle finger in the wound. We have had fairly good weather here only had 3 or 4 days</p>
