<p>January 25, 16<br/>Posted away book of Memorials and old phamplet catalogue &amp; the Benson book of Pater:  now to post old maps of the line and Moore's book.</p>
<p>January 26<br/>42.<br/>All day faint circling blowing snow.</p>
<p>Preparations for a dinner tomorrow night &ndash; Mac, George, Arthur, Blinc, and company.</p>
<p>January 27<br/>43.<br/>Evening:  tonight for a Dinner of 9, already half the crowd are mellow and Rhine wines and Punch stand for drinks.</p>
<p>No mail and a cold day.</p>
<p>January 28<br/>44.<br/>Clearing out pack and sorting old gear about 'Maps', re-discovered 'The Imitation of Christ", found at Becordel just after the Factory Corner stunt.  Opening it, the first read verse &ndash;</p>
<p>It is not lawful to cast them all away, for nature must be supported;  but to require superflueties, and such things as are most delightful, Thy holy law forbids:  for otherwise the flesh would grow insolent against the Spirit.</p>
<p>- just as kit was cut down to a minimum to provide easy space for souvenir Maps and Keats and "Today"!</p>
