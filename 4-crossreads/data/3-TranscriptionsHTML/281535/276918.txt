<p>21/4/19<br/>Strasburg<br/>Not a bad night &ndash; slept sitting up travelling all the time. Dawn found us going through Alsace Lorraine and we passed some old trenches much barbed wire and some ruined villages. At last we got into the Vosges and mountainous pretty country with heavy woods. Glimpses of streams and wooded valleys. Ran out into open land and made Strassbourg about 9 a.m. A porter took me to Hotel du Poste a cheap lodging. This is Easter Monday and all the shops are closed. Walked up the street as far as Place Kleber where there is a statue to the General of that name who was killed at Cairo. From here to Cathedral a fine building on whose tower flies a tricolour. Entered and found a service in progress some good stained</p>
