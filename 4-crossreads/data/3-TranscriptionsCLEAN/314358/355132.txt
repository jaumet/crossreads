Say we are still in Ypres:-
The irregular shape of the shadow dragon is moving past us still.To our question 'are you going in" it has answered "yes"the tail of it comes at last
We step off the kerb and melt into it.We feel men with our shouldering
"Well lads", we ask "where have you come from""From the huts down there by the Engineers saw mill" someone replies."About five miles back" another voice chips in"But we've come from the Somme before that", grumbles a third voice."Was there a chap named Snowy Backthorn with you"
