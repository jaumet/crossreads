<p>Pay day this evening &amp; the boys are all buzzing around.<br/>About 200 yards to the rear of us there is a Belgian battery &amp; this morning I heard the battery commander giving the ranges, they kick up a nice row<br/>9th.  Reveille at 3.45 this morning a real cockies hour, we had our breakfast &amp; "fell in" by 5 oclock &amp; then marched over to Coy. Hqr's where the parties were drafted on to the various jobs &amp; then marched off.  I had a day off &amp; Captain McKenzie  Jock Mackie  Bob Porter  Jack Price &amp; myself went up &amp; had a look at our Assembly trenches where all have to meet in case of attack, they are beauties &amp; half full of water it would be impossible to get in them we would have to lay outside in</p>
