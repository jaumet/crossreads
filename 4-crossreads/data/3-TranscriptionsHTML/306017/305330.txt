<p>we reached the railhead &amp; there we got our water bottles filled, but there was no water for the horses &amp; as they were watered so early in the morning when they will drink very little they must have been thirsty.  Some Tommies were at the rail head &amp; they gave us all sorts of accounts of the fighting at Katieh, [Katia?] so we began to think we would meet Turks any moment.</p>
<p>Our squadrons provided scouts as part of the main advance guard the next morning starting at 7 oclock we marched 3 miles &amp; came on a deserted engineers camp.  The niggers about 600 of them had to leave it after the Tommies went back.  We pushed a couple of miles further on  &amp; reached the Yeomanry camp  My party of scouts rode through it  Everything was lying about, but we had no time to get the loot &amp; we halted a mile past it &amp; the main body 6th &amp; 7th occupied it &amp; found all sorts of good things, beer &amp; champagne</p>
