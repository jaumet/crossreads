<p>Sunday 17 March<br/>Very quiet on the front to-day up till about 5 p.m. when the Bosche guns began to speak in salvoes &amp; sent gas all round us.  The attack is still in progress at midnight. Beautiful clear day, much aerial work &amp; a fine moonlit night. A view of the German line from the top of Mount Sorrel shows the town of Commines (?) (Warneton) almost intact the church spire showing out well.</p>
<p>Monday 18 March<br/>Beautiful day but warm &amp; showing a slight tendency to rain. Fritz has shelled Hill 60 to-day all day with very heavy stuff &amp; the valley between us &amp; the hill has been covered with a smoke pall all day.  It is the most vigorous bombardment of one place I have seen since Pozieres. The Gas is being sent over to-night in small quantities &amp; last night we had a carry through it. Heaviest gas attack I have seen but only one or two casualties were the results. I doubt whether the bombardment of Hill 60 caused many casualties.<br/>Relieved to-morrow.</p>
