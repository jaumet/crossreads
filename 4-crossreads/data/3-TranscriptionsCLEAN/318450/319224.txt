  
 Sailly, for a rest for a few week's.  The rest we got was rout marching and plenty of drill and not to much tucker. 
 We stayed in this place for a few week's, and while here a few of the new hands had to go out to have some musketry, well I was included although I was not a new hand. 
 This will seem hard to believe, we walked 20 miles in one day the next day we were taken to a minature range and most of the boys only fired 10 shot's at the very most, the next day we were marched back, but they cut 4 miles off the return journey.  After our spell, or our so called spell we got on the go to a place called Fleubeaux where we were in support for another battalion which was in the line.
