<p>France<br/>27.6.16<br/>My dear Sister,<br/>As the mail for home closes to-day I am dropping you a line to let you know I am in the best of health &amp; going strong, we are now doing another turn in the line, this time things are a lot more lively, a devil of a lot of artillery "strafing" by both sides, we have had the usual casualities &amp; so far my luck remains good.<br/>I have quite settled down after my trip to London now, am looking forward to the time when I get there again, one thing about here if one gets knocked it means a trip to England &amp; good treatment, not like Egypt, they give our wounded a fine time, there are so many women over there who are anxious to do something for the soldiers &amp; their only way is in connection with Hospital work, so the "Tommy" is well catered for.<br/>Well my dear a lad is waiting to take this to the Field P.O. so will close with fondest love to self R &amp; B.<br/>from Ken</p>
