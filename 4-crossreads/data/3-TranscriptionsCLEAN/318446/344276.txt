  
 14th April We are within range of the Turks by guns after all.  This morning they slung about 30 big H.Es. onto our big A.S.C. dump at Railhead.  Gives one a cold sweat to hear them burst especially when one is within range too.  They make a wicked noise. 
 Later, 7 p.m. Have just been watching the tanks, they started off for the front line to night taking hedges, ditches & even a railway line in their stride.  All had names, H.M.L.S. Tiger - Kia-ora - Ostagel - Ole Lukie - Archibald, etc. etc.  Eight in all.  Armed with 2 six pounders or else 2 machine guns each side.  Inside rather like the cab of an engine at the end-gauges, etc.  Mechanism of the motor tractors runs down the centre while the M.Gs. or 6 pdr. guns are mounted in barbettes sticking out each sides.  One of the crew told me that the temp. inside even in England reached 115!  Bernard amazed absolutely & very uneasy.
