Base DepotEygptI cant help thinking of all our chaps in camp with me here with pink pyjama pants on too.I have never had such a swell trip in a train as I had this morning in the Red Cresent Hospital train; it is beautifully easy, you have a bed to lie on and an orderly brings you any cool drinks you like to order.I am looking forward to getting Father's letters with the news of home.Love to FatherYour loving sonRob.
