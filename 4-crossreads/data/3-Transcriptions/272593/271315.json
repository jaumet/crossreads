<p>About 4 oclock this morning there was a great commotion up round the firing line,  the strength of it was this, early last night our chaps got word that there would very likely be a raid &amp; so they got ready   true enough it came off &amp; it was a dismal failure for the Huns    everything was ready for them artillery, machine guns &amp; all &amp; I believe the ground was littered with their bodies this morning, "revenge is sweet."<br/>When I lobbed in the Camp this morning, I was surprised at the number of entirely new faces &amp; quite a number of details had arrived, including Depina, Baines &amp; a few more.<br/>Capt Edgely has gone to A. Coy"</p>
