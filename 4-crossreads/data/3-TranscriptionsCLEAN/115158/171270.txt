 from the Admiralty directed us to Magdalena Bay, west coast of Mexico. After completing coaling we left for our destination. It was intended that we were to act in conjuction with 3 Japanese & a Russian ship, against the 10 German armed ships known to be off Valparaiso. Our short visit to Fanning Island had been very welcome to the English people there, for they all came on board to see us, & expressed their delight. It was quite a change for them to see a few fresh faces, & when they left us in the evening they gave threebusty cheers. The weather here was extremely hot, & everyone was thankful that were were going north where we should feel considerabley cooler. Duty in the Engine Room was very irksome & uncomfortable in a temperature of 120F, but it was nothing compared to the lot of a stoker employed to train coal in the bunkers where the temperature was as much as 150F. Splendid fellows these stokers are, never a grumble at the hard work which they were called on to do, & living in conditions most unsuitable for hard work. Seldom do they get their mead of praise. Unlike the seaman, who had little to do during the day, & were rarely disturbed at night, the stokers were hard at it day & night - always hot & always dirty.

 A few days out from Fanning Island the ship ran short of potatoes, & with the weather getting cooler & consequently everyones' appetite becoming sharper, it was far from a pleasant experience for us.
