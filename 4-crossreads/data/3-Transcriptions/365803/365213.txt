<p>Dear Judge Ferguson,</p>
<p>Although it is over a month since your gallant son was killed, I really could not bring myself to write before now. This first thing that flashed through my mind when I heard he had been was my promises to Mrs. Ferguson to look after her boy. Strangely enough I made the same promises to Mrs. Connor, wife of  Lt, Connor who so ably assisted your son as 2nd in command of "B" Coy. Both were my very best friends and I can remember now how your son and I felt as we went through Connors effects after his death. War is a grim business   &amp;  I should be quite hardened, but the death of these two brave men   &amp;  intimate friends have shaken me. Need I say how much I sympathize with you   &amp;  Mrs. Ferguson. However, you have this communication   &amp;  I speak from most intimate knowledge;   <strike>that</strike>  your son was just worshipped by his men   &amp;  his subordinate</p>
