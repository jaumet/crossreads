 Sunday, 16th May, 1915 There is a dummy warship being made alongside us out of an old [indecipherable]  it is a wonderful imitation  it is to be used to [indecipherable] the Turkish fire. All day long we have been taking men on board from other boats, mostly medical chaps but a lot of Inf.  Most were wounded in the first fight and have been to Malta and are now convalescent.   a few weeks fighting and a man becomes a real scarecrow.  They are a disreputable dirty bearded lot but gallant heroes in spite of their present  ragged appearance. They are all going back to the hill at Gallipoli.  I met some of my old mates among them one had a list of the killed and wounded of the 3rd Battalion.  Two of my oldest school friends are amongst the killed.  A few of the light horse brigade to which we are attached came on board slightly wounded being picked off by snipers.  They reported that they were all in a big trench just holding the Turks in another not fifty yards away,  snipers playing havoc if they expose  themselves. 
 The British and French are hounding the Turks on three sides, so there is a big battle to take place shortly and there is a chance that we may be there as we were due to sail to-night but it will be morning before we do.  Those that have returned lately say that the stink from the bodies lying in the valley is awful and unless they drive the Turks back they are afraid of cholera breaking out, all the men are lousy, this it cannot be helped, war has to be seen to be realized, wounds are not the worst fact to contend with.  Submarines, cruisers &amp; dreadnaughts are patrolling backwards &amp; forwards all day 
 Monday, 17 May. Arrived at the Dardanelles again at Carpa [Gaba] Tepe went right up to the hill where fighting is going on and all the Turks are entrenched [indecipherable]  the other side there is one gun on the hill that cannot be located, this is a disappearing gun and is firing all day.  a cruiser had just moved out of the way when four shells dropped in the very spot where she had just left  then the Queen started firing from her starboard and her bows she got the range on two villages [indecipherable] two miles distant, she rained shell after shell on them and finally hit a magazine and there was a terrific explosion and the [indecipherable] was soon in flames apparently this had been used as an observation station.  we were right alongside the jetty [?] and every shot that hit we cheered to the echo it was a great sight. 
 About 6.30 pm four shells dropped quite close to us in the water then the battleship Prince of Wales spoke with her 12 inch guns and the shore battery was soon silenced.  The two villages burned all night.  All the convalescent Inf went ashore at night to rejoin their regiments.  Three of our chaps smuggled on board with them, I was too late as officers were watching.  All the men were only slighted wounded and eager to get back again.  I am looking after the [indecipherable] in the galley for the troops and am living well, I cook bacon spuds etc and our mess is called the [indecipherable].  We are off again in the morning this time to Imbros it is all ossis [?], we cannot get away from ossis.
