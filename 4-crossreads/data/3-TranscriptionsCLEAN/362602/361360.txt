I do not know whether that is correct, but we had lovely baths & showers at 6 o'clock & the water was hot then.  Perth is all laid out in squares & every street looks alike.  They have the giddiest trams you ever saw.  Some are Government & others are privately owned.  They are like the old tram cars that you see in parks over our way.  They have cow-catchers sticking out about 10 feet in front of them.  They can't make ice-cream over here.  It is like sand with sugar mixed up with it.  The tram & train lines are only narrow, about 3 ft. 6 in. I think, but the cars are the same width.  We travelled 1st class on 2nd class tickets & the cars, all box carriages, as far as I could see, are very old & dirty.  The trams are all Electric but oh,
