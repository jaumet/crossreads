  
 night sleep. As we were having Breakfast 8 more Ammunition Teams came in & took up a position in front of our Mess Tables.  As soon as the lads unharnessed their Teams, all our Boys offered them Biscuits & Cheese & Tea which they were very thankful as they had been on the road all night & were tired & hungry in fact just about knocked. After they finished & had fed their horses they had their Breakfast & down they laid everywhere some under their Wagons & others in the open, there were a drizzly Rain fallen & it made no difference to them they slept through it all until Dinner Time. They took things easy during the afternoon & evening. The Bombardment was very quiet all Day & Evening. It was freely rumored that the Big Push would start at 4 am next Morning. I invited two N.C.G's to camp in my Tent for the Night which they accepted & I learnt from them that they had orders to move off at 5 am next Morning up to their Guns to move the guns
