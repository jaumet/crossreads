ashore this time safely. Wagon was loaded up & the broken Pole had been mended during the day. I let Eltham go to his Battery & get a change & wash & I stayed on & had tea with the Lowland Battery Q.M.S. McLaren. When the Horses arrived after dark to take the stores we started on our round journey to Headquarters. We had to unload a number of cases at Victoria Gully & then took the others up to the top of ridge & unloaded there. With a big fatigue Party the cases were carried up to Headquarters. Unfortunately one of the Ammunition Column got away with a case of milk & we had other losses in items getting broke etc
