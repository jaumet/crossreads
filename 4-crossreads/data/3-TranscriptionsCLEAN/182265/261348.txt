  Entry 18th - (Arrears)  
 Had a very busy 4 days at  Bourn   Lyndhurst & a 3 hours' examination after. 
 Left there on Friday 3rd Aug, spent the afternoon with another officer (6th Division) in Southampton. We had afteroon tea together at the Savoy - the Crab mayonaise was delicious. We trammed out to the Common - a beautiful road and a grand heavily timbered picturesque place for picnics. The Southampton Gardens & open places are very fine. Leaving Southampton about 8.30pm we reached Salisbury about 9.30. I stayed at Neslon Temperance Hotel. Spent Saturday morning in Salisbury, bought several articles of furniture for the mess & reached Codford Camp at  at  1.30pm. 
 I was informed by Adjutant that I should most likely be going to France within a few days. So I applied for 2 days' leave - from 10pm. Wed to 10pm Friday 9th Aug to 11th.
