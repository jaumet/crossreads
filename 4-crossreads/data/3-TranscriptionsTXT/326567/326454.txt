Monday 11th 1917 Orders came out that we would depart at 8 am next Morning for our permanent Headquarters. All day we were loading up equipment &amp; stores into trucks over in the Railway Yards. After Tea I went into the Village to buy a few articles &amp; went around to say Good Bye to some French People who I was introduced to by a Belgian Sergeant. These people have an  Orchard of 5 acres under cultivation which unfortunately is sadly neglected for want of labour cherries &amp; Pear are in abundance also strawberry, Raspberry &amp; Gooseberry bushes everywhere. Having spent 2 hours I said Good Bye &amp; thanked them for the kindness they have extended to me. I made my way back to Camp to took up my duties for the last time.
