 Very hot & no breeze today Some talk of a Rest Camp being formed at Port Said & a percentage of men going for a Spell at a time.  [Following paragraph crossed out] The Tommies get a lot of leave, but of course the Australians are so undisciplined!!! They cannot be trusted etc. Letter from May dated 28/6/15- please thank her. We have plenty of Bandages with the Red +  tell May not to bother to send [indecipherable].  We use Adhesive Plaster to cover our Watches just leaving the glass uncovered as the sand is so bad it gets into everything & a Watch soon stops.
