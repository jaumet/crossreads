Our force had very heavy casualties, over 600 passing through our station alone, 40% of I.C.C. either killed or wounded &amp; Infantry suffered as bad as on March attack.  Again Murray &amp; his staff sent an inadequate for to capture the position.  Our guns fired over 2000 gas shells, but did not launch the attack until two hours after they were fired, thus giving the enemy time to reorganise his line with fresh troops.

Gruesome sights bombs &amp; bullets whistling through the air &amp; we had 9 men killed, 30 wounded &amp; 70 horses killed.  Flesh &amp; blood everywhere, presenting fearful sight.  Buried those killed on the spot,</p>
