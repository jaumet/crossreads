<p>War Diary<br/>1915  4th Dec.<br/>It is a salient which cuts into our defence, but we could never hold it as it is dominated from Turk positions on Battleship Hill and Chunuk Bair. -<br/>The position appears an extraordinary one for our enemy to be allowed to hold &ndash; it is 400 yds. S. of Antill's Lookout and completely enfiladed and taken in rear by our fire &ndash; But by digging in deep trenches and caves it has been persistently held by the Turks for over six months.  Yesterday was its worst day and it was made untenable for a time &ndash; Our M.Gs. play on it continuously from Table Top and Tolmans Post and Robertson's Sap by day, and from two posts at night &ndash;</p>
<p>5th Dec.<br/>Genls. Birdwood, Godley and Russell (A.C.: Div. C.: &amp; A.C. Comr.) inspected area and trenches &ndash; Deepening and traversing trenches &ndash;</p>
<p>6th Dec.<br/>A good deal of artillery fire from Turks &ndash; denoting fresh supplies of ammunition and guns the last week:  2nd Lt. Latham signals, reported Bde. Police (7) reported to N.Z. and A. Divn.</p>
<p>7th Dec.<br/>Major Nicholas evacuated to have bullet taken out of his knee &ndash; received in May at Quinns.</p>
<p>8th Dec.<br/>All C.Os. and self inspected with C.R.A. Gen. Johnston all guns and batteries between Anzac and Suvla, some 52 in all.  17th Seige Battery fired again at "Snipers' Nest", with fine results &ndash; 69th Battery at Battle Ship Hill:  approval from Divn. for amended Lieut. and Q.M. Sproat to Hospl.<br/>Scheme of defence by which line is held more lightly i.e. by a series of outposts with supports close in rear, resting &ndash; instead of a heavily condensed line of men &ndash; our line not being close to enemy with a deep Dere and very rough intervening ground &ndash; it would be most difficult to surprise us, and under new scheme men will be able to get a fair amount of rest &ndash; Lts. 2nd.
