a few as this club is always full.

July 4th. Wed.

Went round to the Rue Musee to see the damage by the bomb dropped the previous night

At the place where the bomb had dropped there was a deep hole which had penetrated through the stone blocks of the street. On either side of the street the houses were badly damaged and for a hundred yards up and down the street there was scarcely a whole pane of glass in the windows.

July 4th. Wed.
A bomb was dropped by an enemy ‘plane in amongst our tents at the back of the building.

We had heard the ‘plane buzzing about all night.

One of the sisters who was on night duty was slightly wounded on the shoulder. She was operated on but the Surgeon was unsuccessful in getting the small piece of metal. The piece of metal had apparently penetrated the lung.

[Note in left hand side margin side, written later:] This sister got the M.M. for this She was the first nurse to receive this honour.

July 6th. Fri.
Rumour that in our next stunt there are to be nine Operating Teams.

About 10 o’clock to-night the sound of numerous ‘planes was heard up in the air. They showered numerous lights of various colours apparently as signals to each other.

There is a great deal of traffic
