Captain Jacobs is back again in the Company he has been away a very long time now, I think Capt Mckenzie is going to Hospital in the morning he has a small piece of shrapnel near his eye.
Sent a few letters away to day the first chance I have had for some time
1st August. Another beautiful & glorious morning not a cloud to be seen in the sky, & the birds are singing sweetly in the shady trees all around me, the world is not a bad old place after all.
Last night the boys were very riotous & noisy, they kicked up a terrible row to well on to 1 in the morning
