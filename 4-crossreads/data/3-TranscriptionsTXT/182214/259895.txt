 ever has gone wrong they should have joined us long ago. after a march of two kilos we were to get aboard motor buses at Ville Sorrs Corbie. We waited for about four hours in the morning rain got wet through &amp; cold my thoughts turned to home &amp; comforts relived &amp; my thing anybody fed up with get on the motor buses at last. Went miles through Amiens in the dark and arrived at Vajnacourt a fair size village in fact a little town chilled to the bone wet through and hungry. No one was then to tell our bus load where to go to so we got lost this was at 10 pm it&nbsp;was raining hard.
