<p>Italy<br/>One of the two naval signalmen in my watch a young man of 20 years of age which was sent on board at Alexandria. It appears he was signalman on the cargo transport. 6 steamers formed the convoy from England to Alexandria. The escort being a sloop &amp; 2 trawlers. When 60 miles off Alexandria June 9th Sunday at 10 pm one of their ships was torpedoed it being dark at the time. The Clan ______. The sloop remained behind to pick up survivors. The subs followed &amp; at 10.30 pm the 2nd ship _____ was torpedoed. He being in the _____ she was torpedoed at 11 pm. 3 cargo transports sunk out of 6. He &amp; another signal man were 4 hours floating in the water with their belts on no other means of support as there boats were smashed. About a 100 lives were lost from the 3 ships. He was eventually picked up by the sloop in a very exausted condition &amp; sent to the hospital &amp; at present none the worse of his experience although sad.<br/>We here on board maintain that trawlers are useless as escorts as they are too slow to deal with subs. But off course splendid for saving life as is a case after a transport is torpedoed &amp; sinking.</p>
