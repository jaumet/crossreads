Thursday, 29 July, 1915My cold troublesome swallowed some medicine which relieved it fatigues during day.  Drivers came on board and I went ashore  with my mates at night had a good time.  Alex is full of wounded soldiers, & Cairo has more than ever, with Kitcheners Army & 4 Brigades & a Division of Aust as well as the sick & wounded.
It seems as if Warsaw is on its last legs, their has been a bit of a skirmish at Aden with the Turks and some Aust transports stopped there but were [we're] not wanted.
Friday, 30 July, 1915There are seven Hospital ships in the harbour and they are all going out to-morrow, the painters are working night & day to get this boat finished white paint is over everything & one of our chaps who was sick has returned and a couple of the drivers are coming for a trip.
Hot day, swimming & writing our only recreation.
