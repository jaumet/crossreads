<p>12 June 1918<br/>Wednesday<br/>Left Hurdcott about 8. a.m. &amp; arrived at Brightlingsea about 5. P.M. After much changing about on the railway. Having nice fine weather The country about here does not appear to be so nice &amp; fertile as in Wilts.</p>
<p>1918 June 13<br/>Thursday<br/>Doing nothing in particular today. Met a lot of old boys in this Depot. In the evening there was a concert given by some London party. Only just fair Brightlingsea appears a nice little Village - probably about 5,000 inhabitants &amp; boasts a small &ndash; very small - shipbuilding yard.</p>
