<p>20-9-17<br/>To go out at 12. Woke at 11 and got our porridge and bacon. Raining a bit but I didn't think it would set in and we were told we wouldn't move till 3 so tried to sleep again but big gun firing and didn't get a wink.</p>
<p>Artillery seems quite normal. Stunt is 30 min barrage over front line then advancing 100 yards 3 min to first objective then stationary for 30 min. Moving on to end objective blue line at 100 yds per 6' and playing for 3 hrs. approx. 1st Objective Glencorse Wood 2nd edge of Polygon wood &amp; 3rd Middle of Polygon wd 2nd Brigade on our right &amp; 2nd Division on our left. 11th captured 1st objective red. 12th the second objective (blue) &amp; 10th 3rd objective green.</p>
<p>Out at 3 and carried in battle order 3 &frac12; days rations (iron) including the chocolate &amp; private sundries. Took Derby Road &amp; then on to new road leading to dugouts behind Zillebeke Bund &amp; a lake. Very sloppy going out. The 2nd Coy arrived before us and secured all the dugouts so we had to sit outside for an hour or two. Coming along road several high velocity shells came over against road fairly near to us and scared us a bit.</p>
<p>2nd Coy moved out about 4 and we about 5 and along Warrington Road. Absence of traffic was surprising. Barrage opened just as we passed beyond wood about &frac34; mile from top of road and German reply hardly noticeable. Along Menin Road on to our Corduroy Road &amp; only activity was the A.M.C. people. Barrage not so great as was expected. On to our dump where all material was laid out for us except shovels which someone had commandeered. So we had to wait for them.</p>
<p>Things fairly warm there &amp; splinters and M.G bullets plentiful. Here we saw the first batches of prisoners returning along the plentifully directed route. Charlie Day was bruised by M. G bullet in calf of leg just missing entering and retired. On through main road past Chateau Wood and here was a formidable heavy shall barrage we had to pass and several shell bursts quite close to us but effect very local on account of soft ground. Our load of shovels &amp; sandbags</p>
