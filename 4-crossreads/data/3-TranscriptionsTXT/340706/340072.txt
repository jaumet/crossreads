It is surprising how many nooks & corners this little village possesses. All mills here are run by water wheels & every mill is lighted by electricity but the town & private houses are on a contract with gas Co & there is no gas since 1914 on account of shortage of coal & so if you are out late at night you are not troubled with the glare of street lights but you way is lighted by the dim religious light of the stars.
18-4-19 (Fri)This is Good Friday but here it is the same as any other day. There is a voluntary church parade & for the remainder there is a voluntary churchparade so for those who would have clean souls their bodies must remain unclean.
For myself I set off on my billeting & inspecting job. This morning while I was away there has been a big rumpus. Some days ago I opened the door leading out of my room & finding no one there appropriated a carpet, a chair & a rug.
