<p>May 13 Raining the greater part of the night &amp; still at it. Going before the Board this morning to take the verdict &ndash; Later &ndash; They'd give a fellow the pip these Doctors. Have got to wait now for a special report from the Doc at No 13 Hospital. Visited the Barbers &amp; was shaved by a lady, not a bad shave either.</p>
<p>14  Parade as usual, but no Church as far as I can make out. Fine &amp; clear. The old S.M. went crook &amp; told me off to fasten up the flaps of the Guard tent. These Tommy N.C.Os are a lot of damned rotters. The grub is improving some; yesterdays dinner was OK &amp; there was rice pudding to finish up on &ndash; Mistake re Church. A Y.M.C.A. chap chatted to us for half an hour or so &amp; then I trekked for the Ref Canteen &amp; demolished tea &amp; sandwiches. The Parson spoke fairly well, but he's young &ndash; younger than yours truly &ndash; &amp; that's saying a lot. Put up a score<br/>[in margin] Sunday</p>
