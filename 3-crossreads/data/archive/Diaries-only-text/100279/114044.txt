on that score, I wish to heaven we could only get old Jimmy Hearn back he would straighten things up a bit I guess. I believe he offended the 2nd Bde some time back told them they had never done anything yet, they should take an example from the 1st Bde, yes old Hearn worked us got good results too we always got a fair deal.
Since he has gone we don't know where or how we stand.
Plenty of liquor knocking about in the lines tonight, most of whisky too, it bangs the world how they get it
I note they are moving a lot of our heavy guns from this quarter going to Peronne I believe
