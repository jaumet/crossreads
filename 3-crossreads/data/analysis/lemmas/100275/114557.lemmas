 if we are go to be reliev by the 2nd Divis I do n't envi them their job , they wont have it quit so hard as us for we had to take the posit consolid it . 26th . Last night about 11 oclock we file out I think everyon breath a silent prayer when they got clear of it , I know I did for I never expect to come out aliv the 17th Battalion reliev us , when we got out to the Gordon dump our cook had hot stew tea wait for us how we enjoy it , God alon know what a relief it was to us to be out in the clear ground again among the light ; men .
