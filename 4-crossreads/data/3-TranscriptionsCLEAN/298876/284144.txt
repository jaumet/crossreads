Fairly cool day - Sea just like a pond - About the only startling thing today was the number of new Mumps patients - Both Hospitals full up.
One fellow gave us a lot of trouble all night - right off his head & couldn't take our eye off him.
The Y.M.C.A people have a representative on Board to distribute literature, writing material etc - also preacher & is very popular. This fact reminds me very forcibly that the Red Cross people ought to take a hint of go thou & do likewise - I have not one bad thought or word about the Red Cross its ends etc. - but I do really say the stuff they handle from their own efforts - gifts - patriotic & otherwise & more especially as they are so careful as to checking packing etc that their stuff is not distributed as should be to the very best advantage or cases - very often a lot of their stuff goes into
