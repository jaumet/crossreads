20-2-15. Here we are again.  With heaps to write about, but as at the end of lent you will have many sheets of my penmanship, it might be called by some scribbling, this page will see the close of my words for the present.
The letters date the 22d & 29th Decbr. 1914, received from the girls two days ago have be answered and posted, and given God speed on their journey.  Plenty of work here for me, operating and treating all sorts of surgical cases and accidents, this suits me and keeps me from mischief but is not conducive to sight seeing, however 'tis the former and not the latter for which I came.
Look out of my window just now, my eyes lighted upon an erect figure in a cream uniform, words to this effect were formed in my brain:-  Ah there walks Mother Mary Joseph!  How did she get there? - Such is the way that suggestion reproduces in the human mind the form of one who is of one's acquaintance.
Sir E. Holden one of the men in London who has a high reputation for being conversant with finance in the world speaking in London a few days ago ended his speech with these words:- "We must make up our minds that there will be no cessation of this war on account of the gold position in Germany, at all events within twelve months, and it may be longer" -"All places that the eye of heaven visitsAre to a wise man ports and happy havens."Richard II 1-3.
Good bye my dear.  To Mother M Joseph and her colleagues the best of wishes that can go from me.  To you all the thoughts for good that can be conjured up go to you from one who loves you dearly.
