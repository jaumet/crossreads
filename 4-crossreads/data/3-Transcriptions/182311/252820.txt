<p>up. &quot;Who is it?&quot; he asked?&nbsp; Raybould, one of my scouts said &quot;Mr.Peters,&quot; and then that sigh, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever forget it, it was wonderful what expression that man (Private Ball) put into it.&nbsp; Enough of that, I know I did a good job, and God was good enough to let me bring my lads through unharmed, and though I didn&#39;t do anything very wonder-ful, still it was a clean honest job.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; During the night of search, and after I had sent the wounded man in, the General sent a message to one of his staff Officers waiting in the trench, and I got the message and posted it home addressed, I think, to my sister. I&#39;m rather proud of it.&nbsp; This bit of a job is by no means excep-tional though quite distinct from our ordinary work in the trench.&nbsp; Don&#39;t talk this all over the place, but you can let a few of my best firends know and tell them I&#39;ll fill in blanks on my return.&nbsp; The boys who went with me are proud of themselves and their Officer and it has given me extra-ordinary standing in both &quot;A&quot; Coy and the regiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m very well, and altho&#39; the weather is always cold and sometimes very wet, I&#39;ve kept my health.&nbsp; I had quite a narrow escape the other day from a wound, when a shell fragment struck my pipe from my mouth, marking the pipe, shak-ing up my teeth, but otherwise O.K.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; All for the present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best wishes</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAROLD.</p>
