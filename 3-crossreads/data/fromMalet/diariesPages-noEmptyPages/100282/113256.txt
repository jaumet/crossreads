I notice our aeroplanes carry lights at night now, it looks very funny to see them flying about in the sky at first you would wonder what on earth they are.
Saw Cook a few more who are going across to Blighty on the 6 months stunt this morning. About a 1000 Australian New Z. cavalry have just passed us, I suppose they are going up in case they are needed during the next stunt which comes off in a few days time. At 1.30 we moved on again but not very far we are now hung up at an old French farmhouse waiting like Micawber for something to turn up. The Brigade is going in today tomorrow they reckon we won't go in with them worse luck.
We are all short of money at present, I had 5 francs so 3 others I walked into the old farm with this bought some cider milk, we then knocked up a feed up of sardines a little butter
