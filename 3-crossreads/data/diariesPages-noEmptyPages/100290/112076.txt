Saturday
Had an easy night. only one carry about 11.30 p.m. the bright moon is a great help to guide us among the shell holes. Fritz put several over but none fell very near us. Good weather continues fortunately. Ridg Bob self make an excursion into Flers village after wood. such a scene of wreckage desolation. Household furniture bedding mixed in one great broken - confusion. ? the awful ravages of war. When will it all end? Bombardment continues with greater or less intensity all day night.
