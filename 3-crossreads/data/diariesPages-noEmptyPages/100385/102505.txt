zero hour neared the suspense of waiting grew however a few minutes to mini succession of detonations took place and we then knew the strokes mortans which was our only barrage were busing. After two to three minutes of this we were surprised to see burns suming across the platoon front and we knew then the boys were over and that Floitz preferred running to fighting. Shortly after a runner comes to the post for more bombs and told us that the objectives had been gained but the hun reseree machine guns were causing a few casualties. I then took three men and we loaded ourselves with bombs and went forward and found that the hun was forming for a counter attack. Consolidatury and preparing the position gained was being carried as by busy hand and every thing going with a saving when all of a sudden some one shouts sure they come.
