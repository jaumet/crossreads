Rested for a little in dugout when a message arrived that our line had been pierced by Huns and simultaneously heavy rifle fire opened on our right flank. Both artillerys got busy and the enemy took Lagnicourt and worked nearly round us using flares extensively. They occupied one of our sunken roads and killed some men. Met one gunner with a broken gun ? all his crew had been killed. We rushed some guns to Bde HQ and lined the adjoining contours but a counterattack drove him back before hand. We retook Lagnicourt killed many and made 230 prisoners Hardly a successful stunt for them!. We then sent out fighting patrols in front to find out if his line occupied. Much shrapnel used during attack. The 12th Battn was the one pierced and two battalions participated in the attack. Our Lewis guns knocked over many and 4.5's put barrage behind them while 18 pounders chased him back
