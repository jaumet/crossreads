 the Town &amp; made a few private purchases &amp; then went aboard. 
 Could not go out at night as I had to stay on board &amp; pay accounts, which amounted to over &pound;400. 
 Feby 23rd (Tuesday) Sailed 11 a.m. for Aden Good weather.  Not too warm. 
 Feby 24th (Wednesday) Started active Service today &amp; some excitement was caused.  Whilst I was having lunch at 1.30 p.m. I heard a burring sound above my head on deck &amp; reckoned we had sure been struck by a Torpedo.  On rushing up on top I found the Chief Officer with his head down bleeding copiously &amp; Lieut Walker with his trouser leg pulled up &amp; bleeding from the shin.  After the excitement of 1st aid had finished I ascertained that Lieut Kelly was showing the Chief Officer an automatic revolver that he didn't know was loaded &amp; he pulled the safety catch back &amp; it went off, firing almost instantaneously eight bullets.  One passed right through the Chief Officers neck at the back just missing the jugular vein &amp; the spine by a fraction.  Another passed through Lieut Walkers Leg just missing the bone.  Others embedded themselves in the deck &amp; the Doctor had a very narrow escape, as he was sitting next to the Chief Officer on the same box &amp; &amp; 2 holes were found in the deck just above his head.  The Veterinary Surgeon was sitting next to Lieut Walker &amp; he just missed one.
