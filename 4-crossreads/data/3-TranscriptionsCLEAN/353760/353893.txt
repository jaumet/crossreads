March 21treating a lot of gassed chaps from the last night's stunt.  I started reading, with a handy pencil, and first marked,
"Dim with green bubbles and twisted water meets"
and found later the reader before me had read with a pencil, saith,
"Wind-steadied arches leaning on the right".
It's great to read a book marked by an unknown, there's the fascination of constructing an "Imaginary Portrait".
Masefield at Kemmel, escaping long bombarding, by the strange ironies of change, casualties have been a dog of the Belgian killed.  Two days ago, their house was wreaked & the dog killed.  Blowing sky - high over Pack Store.  Johnno has a broken nose, today the temporary pack store - an operating tent, lost itself and its packs, leaving only a great shell hole.  Davies' Bagpipes were there.  Davy will never believe their murder is at the Boche's door, if he does he'll declare war, and join the Infantry.
Now for bed and the feeling that sleep will be heaven.  Today a day of severe vertical breezes!
March 22235,Evening, one of shells of last night's accompaniment through the Brewery and out a window.  Slept with only one waking, when the bricks fell.  Shelling today caught one of 55th Bty. chaps by the Y.M., and severed leg by ankle, another shell killed one orig. 4th chap at baths & wounded others, we there at the toot with lbs. of dressings.  Last night one of Y.M. men knocked.  Report is of Dranoutre being heavily shelled and one of Y.M. men killed, also about a dozen horses.
235B.Bullecourt lives in war again - falling it is now reported - by rumour - having been taken by the Yankees.  "So the Yanks have had a win!", one of our Engineers told us.
We've found here, and taken to our company, a war cat with only three legs.  A bonser old cat, asleep by the fire.
