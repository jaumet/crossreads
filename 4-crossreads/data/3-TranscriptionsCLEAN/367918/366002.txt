 My dear Judge I have reached the first stage on the way home. Am now at Le Havre. The camps are wonderfully well organised and I cannot find anything at all to do. All the cleaning, equipping, enrolling & so on are taken over by the camp staff and the quota staff are not even asked to look on. 
 Arrived here two days ago and do not leave until 13th. The 12th, by the way, is the anniversary of my embarkation in Australia. There is a strong probability of our being held up for a long time in England but as the school is moving as a complet unit some arrangements may be possible over there. 
 I shall send you a cable as soon as word of our embarkation is received. 
 Best Love Yours affectionately C.R. Lucas
