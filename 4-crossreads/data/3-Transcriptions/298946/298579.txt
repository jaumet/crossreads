<p>The boat has a fair amount of deck space, but this is taken up by fixtures, and in any case is insufficient for the numbers on board.</p>
<p>We have a promenade deck on both sides amidships open to troops and families alike.  Above that is the boat deck forward half of which is for officers 2&amp; first class passengers ( who are few), and the aft half except on isolation sections for troops above.  The aft half deck is for families &amp; troops; the forward one for troops.  Aft for steerage passengers (wives etc)  &amp; forward</p>
