I doubt the resisting power of any earthwork or redoubt against these heavy shells.  They plough huge craters in the ground &amp; their size may be judged by the fact that one of the base of one wh was fired last night could have covered a large dinner plate with ease.  And they stand 3&frac12; feet high.

Gen. Godley, accompanied by Lieut-Col Heaton Rhodes returns from Mudros.

It came to a dead-end half a dozen yds above the General's quarters.  A second shell planted itself near the wireless pole &amp; a third tore a crater in the earth at the mouth of the gully near the Indian Camp.  And then followed a fusillade of two or three shells a minute.  The strong &amp; cantankerous wind planted them in all sorts of odd places &amp; interesting places but fortunately no one was injured.  An Indian gunner received a slight chest bruise from a shell planted
