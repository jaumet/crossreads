As we neared Gallipoli we saw a flash light on Cape Hellas. As we neared the shore the sound of incessant rifle fire and the sound of bullets dropping into the water gave one definite notice that we had reached the scene of action. 
As we were leaving the barge to go ashore a few bullets fell on to it, wounding one of our number in the arm.

He had just been returning from hospital having already been wounded. To the right of us lay a battleship, from which a magnificent searchlight was showing on to the shore. The sound of a tremendous report of a large gun firing startled us and one could clearly see by means of the searchlight, the smoke rising at the spot the shell had burst.
