  
 Sunday 2 April 1916 Went to church at St. Chads, Cremorne with Aunt Katie and  the  Hal & Fred. Spent the evening at the Sams. 
 Monday 3 April 1916 Came up to L.H. camp at Menangle.  Had great job to get my blankets etc. and was told I would get no pay for time I was away, however I went and saw our officer & he is going to try and get it for me. Have got in with same chaps I was with before;  they have all had their final leave.
