12/11/17 Ypres Wippenhoek
Early reveille and turned out on the march at 8 a.m. Traffic was tremendously congested with transport and troops and our progress was very slow in consequence. Fortunately the day was fine and sunny but the march was hard on the men's tender feet. The wet has played up considerably with the boots. On the route we marched past General Birdwood who had a few things to say!. Got the ?oil" that we are to have 3 weeks out of the line and the quiet trenches afterwards. Reached tents and hut billets at Wippenhoek (just inside France) and got all settled down fairly comfortably for the night. All in fair heart after last trip up the line but Italian news is far from cheery and inspiring. Night fell very early and was cold and dark.
