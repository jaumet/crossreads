[Friday 29 December 1916]
This land is different to Egypt as we know it.  Here it RAINS, in fact has been for 4 days, last night an extra heavy shower one of the men sang out QUACK! QUACK,!!! & not another sound was heard.Like me buying my Fowl holding out 5 Piastres & saying "Chuck Chuck" only language available.But in the dead of night it showed the men were right -of course very bucked at their success.Gen Chetwynde paraded us & did the usual about our wonderful cavalry work makes the Tommies a bit jealous, but they always do their bit & certainly in France, a big bit.
