Gallipoli15th Nov 1915
My dear Father,Another mail arrived today bringing another batch of letters & papers. The English papers you are sending arrive regularly & are eagerly devoured, first by myself & then by the other officers of the battalion, where they land up I can't say. The Australian papers are also a boon, & it is very interesting to read the straight forward accurate accounts of events by Capt Bean, & then compare them [indecipherable] with the absolute piffle imagined by a man called Bartlett. Whether he has ever been on this peninsular or not, of course I can't say, but judging by his writing I would be quite prepared to doubt it. We have just moved from our old position & are all very disappointed, as we had just connected up with the Turks underground. When we wanted a bit of excitement we used to enter the tunnel & have a bit of a revolver duel with the foe. We were gradually driving him back by building up sandbags & gradually pushing them forward. As long as nothing but sa bullets were used it was good sport wh but when they started bombs it was not so funny. One or two officers were laid out by the concussion & jabs, but recovered. The whole of the work was done by officers. We were just expecting to get at them when we were moved.Your Affectionate sonArthur
