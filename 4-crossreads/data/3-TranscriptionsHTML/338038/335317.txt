<p>Brigade Major, Major  C.W. Bates of the R.F.A.</p>
<p>This is a senseless sort of letter  but I don't want the mail to go out without some sort of a line to you.</p>
<p>I have not been sending any letters to Pat lately, thinking he would have left   If not of course give him my love.</p>
<p>With all my love dear Father &amp; Mother</p>
<p>I am your loving Son<br/>Terence</p>
