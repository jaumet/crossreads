<p>Saturday, 1915</p>
<p>Saturday 4</p>
<p>Worked at the incinerator in morning &amp; lit it just as the howitzer started firing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it made a big smoke &amp; up came the artillery major with "Put the b&mdash;fire out its obscuring our aiming post &amp; will attract fire". Worked like hell to put it out.  In the afternoon it started again while Bourne was getting wood. Got it out.  Shells <strike>burst</strike> bursting all roads all day.</p>
<p>Had to stick there in the open.  Just finished when Beachy Bill burst right overhead &amp; gave me a pellet in the right thigh.</p>
