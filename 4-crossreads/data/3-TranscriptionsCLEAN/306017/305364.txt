good & the weather is getting cooler but the flies are still bad.  On Saturday [9th] morning at 3 am our Brigade left camp & marched to Ganddel [?] NE from our camp at Hassaniya.  We reached there shortly after daylight & stayed there till 4 pm  My troop was on left flank guard  At dark we were joined by the 3rd Brigade & the artillery (8 guns) & we marched all night.  It was very tiresome having had no sleep for nearly 2 days.
We reached within 2 miles of the Turkish camp at daybreak  The 3rd Bgde went to the right & we went straight on.  The Turks were well entrenched & we should have been 2 miles further north.  As we were in the wrong place at daylight we had lost the element of surprise & it was impossible for us to make a frontal attack.  We engaged them till noon (17th Sept) inflicting casualties & taking 15 prisoners, our artillery shelling their trenches.  Our aviators were very daring & did good work.  On the way back we found water for our horses & selves  We had a spell & boiled our billies at 3 pm
