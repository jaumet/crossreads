<p>Is it not so?<br/>Keep an eye on the sheckels, there is in every case never a friend like a shilling or two. Money in sufficient quantity can purchase most anything in this world. It is a common statement in these days, that the side which will win ultimately in this great war is the one who can find the most money. What vast sums are being expended each day for no better purpose than destruction of man and his works. It is deplorable. And would you believe it, 'tis he who calls himself civilised, the most advanced in civilisation that the world has ever known. Bah!!!.<br/>I shall write to Mr Walsh at the library asking him to continue sending the illustrated papers. I am angry that they should have ceased to send them.<br/>I told Jerom that his daughter brought to you a bunch of flowers, I shall give him your letters to read. He reads out loud very well, and I often get him to read the telegrams when I am at my meal, or other interesting matter.

The human intelect when crimped cabined and confined must find outlet for its activities in some field of thought, it can not be kept from acting by all the rules that have been made for the guidance of cloister or convent. Ones thoughts are his personal property, and of them none can rob him. Of their nature or purpot none can know unless the thinker vouchasafes to pronounce words which tells them to some listener.<br/>Bertie got out of his depth and his element in the military work, while his cocksuredness led him to believe that he was perfectly able for it. The game is much different from the running of a place like the P. A. Hospital [Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney].  However he will get over it. I have seen but little of the evidence yet.<br/>The two copies of the S. M. H.
