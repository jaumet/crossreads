  
 11 - separate envelopes - a great boon to have a decent one to put on. I only had two left out of 6 and they were yellow. I shall have to get some more print frocks made if we are going to be much longer at the war. But I fully see I can live in the shift I get issued to me as a nursing sister without much extra expense. All my under clothes are just as good as ever night gown etc and do not need renewing - so I hope my debt to Father will soon be erased. I may have some extra expenses between our change from here to our next spot of work as I expect we will be sent somewhere to wait the arrival of equipment. I must go to bed now. I hope Constance is alright poor darling what a hard time she had and it must have been very anxious for you. I believe my sister Jocelyn will soon be a head winner - she writes me - I expect she'll be earning more than me shortly. Goodnight my precious Mother & Father, I hope God will keep you both safe and well through this anxious time - Devotedly your daughter Betha.
