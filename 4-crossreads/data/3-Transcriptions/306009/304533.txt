<p>1915<br/>Dec. 17 Fri.<br/>In the afternoon for exercise walked into town through Kasr-el-Nil  &amp; past Abdin [Abdeen] Palace &ndash; bought to-days "Bourse" (French Daily) &amp; had afternoon tea at Groppis &ndash; then walked back again. A lot of English people must be coming to Cairo now - I passed quite a number in the streets.<br/>After tea went round to 1st Cairo Scouts' clubroom where there was a flag dedication ceremony.</p>
