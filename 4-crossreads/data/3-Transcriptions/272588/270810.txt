<p>Sunday 1 December<br/>A walk round the Station &amp; there a scene of desolation &amp; wreckage is to be seen, scarcely imagined.  Trucks &amp; railway lines are thrown yards away &amp; it is the greatest bit of destruction I have seen.</p>
<p>Monday 2 December<br/>Fine day &amp; I took advantage of it to run into Muageuge, the great Frontier fort of this district.  It is indeed some fortress &amp; the ramparts are very solid indeed.  The streets are narrow &amp; the town old fashioned.</p>
