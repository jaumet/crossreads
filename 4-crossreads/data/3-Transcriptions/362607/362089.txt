<p>Dear Mum,<br/>How do you like the look of this Country. This would be taken about the end of the Spring. It is just lovely in these parts then. Only Poets &amp; great Writers could attempt great descriptions of this lovely Country in Spring &amp; Summer Time. I am going to set the Table now. I am quite at Home &amp; Marie wonders how I fixed all the things in the Place. Auntie does nothing about the House Keeping. She only cooks &amp; washes but Marie does everything else &amp; she is so tidy &amp; orderly that it is no trouble to find anything. The Vicar is Home from the Kirk so I will leave for now &amp; write a few lines to you all after dinner. The weather has been lovely &amp; I have been out on the bike or walking every day.</p>
