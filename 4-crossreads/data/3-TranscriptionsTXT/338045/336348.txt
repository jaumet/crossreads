has cleared & a fine day. Receive leave pass from 1 pm to 9 pm & spend the evening in London. My feelings are again being in this city are more than I imagined after all the days spent thinking of it out in France. A nice walk to Orpington station & train journey to Charing Cross which I reach at 2 pm. Take the bus to Hdqrs, Horseferry Rd, & here meet many of the old-boys. A walk around Strand, Westminster & the Embankment, a few bus & tube rides & tea, taking the 7.30 pm back & arrive in hospital at 8-45. Punctual on time. Tired & sleep well.
