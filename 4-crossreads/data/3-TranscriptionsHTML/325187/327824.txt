<p>[Sunday 19 March 1916]</p>
<p>Today I went to a Coptic Church Service, <strike>really R.C.</strike>   The Priest wore a Silver Brocade!!! gown with Gold Tinsel (Poppy Pattern) &amp; a Cowl or hood of same&mdash;Choir of boys, Incense was burnt &amp; many candles  Music consisted of Cymbals &amp; Triangles.  The boys mostly X eyed wore Red Plush Caps &amp; had good voices- all Arabic.  All the (Bints) girls &amp; women were in a Gallery with screen to hide them  Most gaudily painted with Doves etc &amp; glass Candleabra on which the sparrows perched.<br/>Sing Song service, they never punctuate like in conversation only stop to take breath, &amp; stare at us.  Towards the end, an interpreter butted in with enclosed translation in bad English &amp; I had to thank them   Communion was held <strike>&amp; I brought 1 cake home</strike>.<br/>After Service the priest fed us on Quail Pigeon, Whisky Soda etc so we go next Sunday.</p>
