at Gaza are doing splendid reconoitring work against the Turks I can just imagine it and only wish I was back there and to think that the Curs here have forsaken their own flesh & blood and prevented comforts and provisions from reaching them. Tongue cannot express how our boys will feel it. Wishing Mr Wilson & yourself the best of health
Yours Sincerely George Coates
