All day trip to Windsor Castle and Eton College. Was shown over the Castle and Stables. We were entertained at lunch at the Castle received souvenir Post Cards from the King Queen.

I was also struck by the small sizes of the suits of Armour in the Armoury. Seen "The Man from Toronto" at the "Duke of York" Theatre in the Evening. Miss Marie Lohr played the principal part. This Theatre is rather like our "Crystal Palace".
