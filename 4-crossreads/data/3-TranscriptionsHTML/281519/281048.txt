<p>Ribemont <br/>27/1/17 Bitter cold. Carried out a Battalion attack over a snowclad hill to the complete satisfaction apparently of General Smythe who was watching it. Then returned home stayed indoors all the afternoon, it was so cold and wrote letters all the evening</p>
<p>28/1/17<br/>Hunt not turned up from his Amiens leave and I register vows of sacking him. Later in the day I notice an almost feminine touch about my room, fighting kit all neat and new laid out ready for tomorrow and such little things as new chains on my spurs. But he very carefully avoids meeting me face to face fearing the wrath to come. Our cook has contracted V.D. and has gone to hospital. Madame noticed his absence and asked the reason. The nearest my French would go was "maladie d'amour" which she quite understood and quite a lengthy discussion ensued on mademoiselles of easy virtue and their dangers. A good woman and a mother she sees no harm in unconventional discussion of these intimate matters. At 10.30 marched to church parade which was bitterly cold and almost painful standing</p>
