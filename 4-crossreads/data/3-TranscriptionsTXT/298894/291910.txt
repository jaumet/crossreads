the day the time came when our chaps could not go further & retired a short distance.  The Turks seemed to have the range to perfection.  We could see the shrapnel bursting & it caused great havoc  Officers had a bad time several companies being depleted altogether I will never forget Sunday 25th of April.  I really believe it will mark an era in Australian history.  On this day Australians proved themselves.  They landed under heavy fire, a thing rarely attempted & never flinched once & the result was victory.  Our men were deliberately picked for the honour and proved that the trust shown in them was not misplaced.   A captain assured me that 40 &percnt  casualities were spoken of & expected.  Would Kitchener send anyone to such a job?  Just on dusk a cruiser came close to us & heavily bombarded the Turks.  At each broadside our ship quivered & the noise was deafening.  I was in a fuelling boat alongside getting wounded out at the time & twas almost unbearable the shells going almost over our heads & the concussion changed a calm sea into a choppy one causing our boats to rock terribly.  It was  a relief to get on board again.  During the night fitful firing was heard but the main thing was that our artillery was landed & took up there position
Monday 26th  dawned & the battle was still going on but the Turks began to get a little of what our chaps had suffered shrapnel bursting over their lines continuously.  We had still a quantity of rations & ammunition to unload so could not leave for Alexandria
