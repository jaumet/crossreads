General is followed by a great outburst of cheering from the Boys - after which  they shoulder "W.B." (Birdie) & carry him to his car - Before completing the action, however, the General quite happily allows himself to be stripped of buttons, numerals and badges. It is plain to see that he is overcome by the scene & is genuinely sorry to see the last of his Gallipoli men.I would like to know if any other General has such an affectionate regard for "his Army" or the Army for him.
