 Sunday 25 February 
 Arrived Albert 4 a.m. walked to the Bellevue Farm Rest Camp and found our unit still there.  Rumours current relative to the Germans having fallen back before Bapaume. While I was away arrangements were made between the Field Cashier &amp; our unit to put me into the 56th Batt. as Pay Sergeant, so I have to go out there tomorrow.
