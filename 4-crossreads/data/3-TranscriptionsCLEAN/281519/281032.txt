The men all well dug in in their trenches and fairly comfortable. Yarned a good deal during the day. At 5 pm commenced to move the Battalion up to the firing line and changed headquarters myself. In Indian file we plodded along among clayey shell holes striking cultivation plots at intervals. Nearing the firing line open country comes to view until it is easy to miss ones way. Bullets flick past often and odd shells drop close. Passing over two sunken roads we come to Battn H.Q. in among as ramshackle a collection of rubbish heaps as could be imagined. A warm spot as shells keep dropping with frequency. Had tea and talked with Duggan and relief was complete by 8 pm. Re-settled ourselves in the dugout and settled down to our four day firing line stunt. Settled down to sleep to the lullaby of 5.9's crashing all around.
