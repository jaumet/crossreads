<p>5<br/>Did you get a letter from me describing something about shooting at aeroplanes etc<br/>I wrote that when in the convalescent depot at Cayux</p>
<p>Cayux is not far from the mouth of the Somme</p>
<p>On being discharged from the convalescent depot at Cayux I was sent back to Etaples as repaired and fit for further active service</p>
<p>Etaples is our base in France. It is the place where I spent the first few weeks in France training for the front.</p>
<p>Well on finding myself back there I immediately asked to be sent on to my company (the 12th Field Coy Engineers), but was told such a practical proceeding was impossible</p>
