18/12/18 Solre-le-Chateau - Solre St GerySpent a sleepless night and had to get up several times. It rained nearly constantly. Up at 5.30 am in the pitch dark and shaved and breakfasted. Went into the old church which is a fair sized place with good stained glass windows. The usual side chapels had candles burning in them even at this early hour and there was more than one silent worshipper. The rain was coming down in cold sheets and a more wretched day it would hard to imagine. Set off in column of route at 8.30 am and had a bit of trouble with roads owing to some engineer pontoon wagons getting bogged. Plugged on steadily through the rain passing through country that must be very pretty in peace time. At 11 am we left France and found ourselves in Belgium. A post with red and black stripes and indicating a Douane Belge marked the frontier. From
