<p>Tuesday 3 [2] April 1917 [1918]<br/>A day of sorrow &amp; not to be dwelt upon.  Principal items &ndash; large dose of castor oil given in pure brandy, the latter burns my throat so badly that a vomiting episode results, finally a No. 13 pill &amp; Cal. [Calomel] gr. iii are swallowed with endless trouble with B.P. [bed pan ?] &amp; bell-ringing etc., results no notice is taken of a bell until ring 5 or 6 times &amp; I feel so miserable that the night is one long nightmare.<br/>Thirst! where shall I secure enough of the old Nile to be satisfied, I wonder?<br/>Visited 10 a.m. by O.C. &amp; very businesslike he is.  Throat &amp; tongue inspection take place.</p>
