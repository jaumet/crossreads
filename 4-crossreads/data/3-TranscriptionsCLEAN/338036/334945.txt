  
 Tuesday 4th [Sept] Excellent day again. 
 Wednesday 5th A Sports meeting is to be held next Wednesday (unit affair) and most of us have decided to put the week in training so as to enter for some of the events.  Consequently I had a run tonight but felt horribly 'windy'.  Have also decided to 'chuck' smoking for the interim. 
 Thursday 6th Another run at night.  Felt much better.  The boys are showing decided promise 
 Friday 7th Heavy thunderstorm settled all prospects of training for today & we felt the advantage of the spell. 
 Saturday 8th Very heavy mist this morning & 'Blue Mountains' came to mind.  At 8.30 our Section was paraded and immediately afterwards we set out for a route march with full packs up - arrived at Ouve Werquin at about midday & halted 2 hours for swim & dinner.  River very cold.  Set out again on return journey at 2 pm & after uphill journey arrived back at Ecurie at 4.30.  Short run at night. 
 Sunday 9th Muster Parade.  Our Section tool over the hospital at 10 am.  In afternoon - swim after brisk walk.  Training
