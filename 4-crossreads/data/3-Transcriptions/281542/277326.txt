<p>which the troops could hear but not see.  "What the eye don't see the heart don't grieve."</p>
<p>Rabbit diet for dinner getting mighty monotonous &ndash; insipid, tough, &amp; boney.</p>
<p>Day was intolerably hot &amp; muggy.</p>
<p>Thursday 15th July 1915</p>
<p>Equatorial weather with a vengeance.  Blistering heat.  Scarce a ripple on the sea.  Sour bread &amp; corned horse for dinner.  Complained about bread but was given the option of hard biscuits for 3 days or continuance of bread.  "This is the life."  Crossed the Equator at noon.  Half holiday.  Neptune's sports &amp; boxing championships.</p>

<p>Uneventful.</p>
<p>Saturday 17th July 1915</p>
<p>Fresh westerly &ndash; heavy swell.  Boxing semi finals on saloon deck &ndash; rough conditions at night &ndash; saloon deck port side frequently awash &ndash; slept below &ndash; bad night &ndash; ship rolling heavily &ndash; about 4 a.m. all awakened by terrific thump on ship's side &amp; scattering of crockery, plates, boxes &amp; other gear.  Many thought it was a collision so great was the noise.  When we rose at Reveille the mess deck was strewn with a mass of gear &ndash; from plates, knives, forks, cups, cheese, butter, clothes etc.  In fact everything had been shifted by the impact of the night &ndash; wind blowing strong from W &ndash; proximity of coast no doubt the cause &ndash; expect to pass Aden during day or night.</p>
<p>Sunday 18th July 1915</p>
<p>Hellish weather &ndash; monsoon &ndash; decks awash all day.</p>
<p>Boat changed her course about 2 pm to due west from NW, as we approach Gulf of Aden.  Then we received the full blast of the terrific wind &amp; storm wrack &ndash; great green seas came at us as if determined to envelop us in one huge swallow &amp; thumped down on the deck every minute or two like mighty knocks from a gigantic hammer.  The ship alternately rolled &amp; pitched &amp; the storm continued late into the night.  Lily two years old today.</p>
