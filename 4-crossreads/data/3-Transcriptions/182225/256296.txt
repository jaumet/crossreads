<p>1916&nbsp;&nbsp; MONDAY 26&nbsp;&nbsp; JUNE</p>
<p>A warm &amp; muggy day &amp; we felt it a lot more having all the guard rig out on, as we have to wear our life belts all the time we are on duty. The 28<sup>th</sup> Battery relieved us at 4 pm. I had a good hot bath in a greasy bucket with greasy water in it, but we dont bother about trifles like grease nowadays &amp; felt much better &amp; cleaner after it. Went down B deck after tea &amp; had our usual game of 500, Bill &amp; Self played Eric Mackellar and Corporal Peach of the 26<sup>th</sup> Bat. The guard had rifle practice at tins thrown over the back of boat during the afternoon &amp; we did not do too badly.</p>
