wire where we lay low in holes for the 20th. Signal, which never came so about 1/2 hour later got orders to return to our own lines about 100 yds back. The fire was terribly fierce. Machine gun Rifle grenades shell fire Fritz lit the place up like day with flares. We waited for a while till fire slackened then got back . Dumped my gear to make matters easier. All wounded were brought in also some of 1st Div. who had been out 5 7 days. Stayed in front line passing ammunition bombs firing flares till daylight.
