  
 Tuesday 10th Dec.  Had rather a rough passage down, having a sick turn in the train, with very little sleep.  Went straight to the Bonnington Hotel on arrival at 7.30 A.M. & had a wash, shave etc before breakfast.  Then having a number of small commissions to perform spent the morning rushing around London.  Had lunch at a National Kitchen, a restaurant run by the Government & found it splendid.  On entering one buys tickets for food required & then collects same at the Counter, repairing next to a table to consume the said food.  For 1/9 I had, fish, beef potatoes & cabbage, pudding, bread & tea & the helpings were liberal & well cooked. 
 Altogether a splendid institution & well patronised.  Next booked a room near Victoria Station for Wednesday night in order to be close to the train
