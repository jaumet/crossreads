<p>28 July 1918<br/>Sunday<br/>9 After Trinity</p>
<p>An uneventful day. Church Parade in morning. Weather getting uncomfortably warm. The boat is by no means clean &amp; it is not too comfortable as one cannot find a clean spot to rest in. The sea is very smooth with just a little ground swell.</p>
<p>1918 July 29<br/>Monday<br/>Still getting along safely. The sea is very calm &amp; the weather very warm. No news though about anything We have not sighted a boat of any description for days past. We appear to be right off the tracks of any boats.</p>
