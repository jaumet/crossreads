<p>Fless.Trenches.Somme Nov 19th<br/>19th Weather very cold. Got busy cleaning Lewis Gun &amp; making ourselves more comfortable. Heavy shelling continoues on both sides which stands all the nerve tests a man's got Water to being scarce. Had to crawl out on our bellies at night time to shell holes for water dead bodies laying all around us   &amp; stand the risk of getting potted. As the germans where only 75 yrds away Could hear them talking   &amp; digging in for their lives. German Areoplane bombed one of our hospitals in the rear on the 6th Nov killing   &amp; wounding a large number of men. Eventually he was brought down before he got back  &amp; promptly shot</p>
