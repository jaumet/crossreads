<p>rocks ashore was a Torpedo Destroyer broken in halves. She was driven ashore by the rough weather last Sunday we found &amp; was a total wreck. All her guns had been dismantled &amp; she was stripped of everything possible so that it would not be further destroyed by shelling from the Turkish guns.</p>
<p>We heard plenty of the crash &amp; booming of the guns as we neared the shore. On board the Trawler we had a lot of Greeks who had come over from Embros evidently to work at Suvla on contract. At Embros they get the magnificent sum of 2/6 per day while working for the Authorities. Those we carried over were a motley looking crew as far as dress was concerned &amp; which gave some of them a very cut throat appearance. Some in caps vests coats sashes of considerable length which were wound round &amp; round them others had ordinary sacks cut as vests or aprons etc</p>
