<p>for a wonder we did not have to change for we struck a through train which took us right to Warminster.<br/>21st.  Back again in Camp &amp; am doing a loaf this morning, while I was away old Billy Hughes paid the Camp a visit I should have liked to have been here with my Kodak &amp; got a snap or two.<br/>There was a bit of fun here this afternoon a lot of the "diggers" were playing "two up" when a fight started over a bet, &amp; they got to one another like mad, I grabbed my camera &amp; rushed out in time to get a snap at the contestants.<br/>Have been writing practically all the day have penned 9 letters some of them fairly long ones at that.<br/>22nd.  Took over the Dental work again this morning so I will be kept busy once more, I am feeling absolutely grand now &amp; fit for anything</p>
