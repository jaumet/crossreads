<p>&hellip;. It was just dusk, and I had gone down to the end of the Company to see that they were standing to arms, and was talking to the sergeant watching them drop a couple of shells on one of our saps.  Then I saw a bomb coming and we ducked, then a shell, and we slipped into the shelter of one of the bays in the front trench.  After that they lifted the lid off hell &ndash; bombs, rifle-grenades, shells, coal-boxes, weary willies and whiz-bangs all bursting at once.  They made some noise, but the thing that impressed me most was the tearing rending sound they made, like gigantic hail tearing along before a thousand-mile-an-hour gale through an orchard. &hellip;.</p>
<p>After the bombardment was over, I had to go along to B Company, next to ours, and see how they were.  It was deuced tough going:  there were hardly any duckboards left, (these are the wooden footways raised above the mud) and two or three times I fell down holes three or four feet deep.  Got rather a shock when I switched on my torch, and on looking up found no parapet between me and the Germans &ndash; blown clean away &ndash; and fully expected some shots at the light.  Things were in a deuce of a mess there, parapets and dug-outs and everything mere heaps of earth.  This was Ferguson's Company (he's now a Captain) but I naturally had no time to yarn with him.  The three officers with him were outed, one missing and two badly wounded, and he had about 24 killed and 60 wounded. &hellip;.</p>
