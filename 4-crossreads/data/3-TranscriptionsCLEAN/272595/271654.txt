have actually come in contact with since being in the Forces.Bought a nice little toilet case this evening for 5/- I am going to send it down to Littlehampton, it will come in handy afterwards for a fellow wont be soldiering all his life not if I know it at any rate, I am always a buyer for these sort of things   Since 4 oclock it has been raining cats & dogs but the sun is shining nicely again now.After tea tonight Lindsay & I went down to the O. T. B. to see Len & found him busily engaged playing bridge so we did not stop long, but went down to Sutton Veney & had our usual snack for a wind up.I have only been near my guard once during the day so you can see its some job.
