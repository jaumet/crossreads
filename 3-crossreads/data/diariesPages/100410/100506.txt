(4) Killed in action
What preparation can I writeTo warn you of your loss?To mitigate in black whiteThe burden of the cross?These little things kept separate His diary half begun;How can these trifles compensateA mother for her son!
The consolation men might seekIn knowing how he diedSeems so inadequate and weakWhere sorrow weighs down pride.
The Mother of all Sons bestowAll grace comfort, tillThe bidding comes for you to goWhere men no longer kill!
To "F.L.R." 26/4/15 In France
You with the boyish laugh; the sunny eyesThat always smiled when danger threatened worst;Would you have had things ordered otherwiseIf death could be prevented, fate reversed?
You were so bright, we brightened 'neath your touch,To all alive, your silence seems unreal.Can it be true that you who felt so muchLie there alone and can no longer feel?
O comrade, though maybe they call you dead,To us who loved you, THAT you cannot be!God grant when in my turn I too am sped,Someone may find as much to say of me.
