<p>Fine. Got to town early and had breakfast at Petty&#39;s with father &nbsp;buzzed round town all day &nbsp;Linda &amp; Jo had tea with us at the [Grey?] Salon in morning and dinner at Petty&#39;s with us &nbsp;Father &amp; I saw Ashford in afternoon and he promised me I would not be molested after I came back from the war. Met Jo &amp; Linda again and came back by boat. Had tea with father at Petty&#39;s and he went home after. I went up to the Criterion Theatre and met the 15/1 &amp; 15/3 theatre parties and we saw &quot;Under Fire&quot;. it was very realistic</p>
