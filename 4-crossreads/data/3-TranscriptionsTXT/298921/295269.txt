 October, 1915 Monday 25 This morning I viewed brother "Turk" again, beautifully clear &amp; the bay calm with gunboats &amp; Hospital boats as before -  Tucker  "Bonelli" beef &amp; biscuits but it is good to be on the job again.  Taubes  flying over &amp; also our aeroplanes not much shelling &amp; all hands busy preparing for the Winter by digging in &ndash; Sleep rather coldly but will soon get accustomed to that. Many improvements have taken place in saps roads &amp; trenches since I left &amp; the smell of dead Turks is not so bad.
