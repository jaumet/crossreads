Caught midday train reaching London where I was kept very busy at bank etc. By 6pm train went to Bolton and reached "North Leigh" about midnight finding them waiting up for me. Never felt so at home anywhere in my life before as here, they were both so loving and homely nice. Beautifull room and surroundings.
