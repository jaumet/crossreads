<p>11/11/18 Yzeux<br/>General Robertson called for me in his car at 9.30  and we drove out to Vaux. Passing out through St Vast the slack saluting of the car was marked on my return. I  <indecipherable</strike>  up several people hard. Pulled up at the NCOs school at Vaux and found things going fairly well there. Then down to rifle range and saw the 23rd and 22nd at work on platoon competitions. The General dropped me at St Vast on his way back and I noticed Cox putting a message up on the board to the effect that the armistice had been definitely signed. Ordered the band out to parade the streets and to play the Marseillaise. Little French kiddies followed the band. Civilians gave flowers to the drummers. We then hoisted the Tricolour and the Australian flag side by side on the church</p>
