<p>Monday 24/12/17<br/>Cold &amp; foggy hardly able to walk about ground so slippy just like glass.<br/>Prospects for tomorrow rotten Xmas mail sunk both ways.<br/>deferred Pay &pound;39-10-6 &ndash; 94/6 came a lovely cropper this morning have to make up Wifes allotment of 4/- per day from Aug 30th last Puts me overdrawn &pound;12-5-11 <strike>more</strike> another instance of Brains in our fool Army. Seems that when you get 10/- per day you have to pay your wifes allotment &amp; this should have been done when I got the 2 stripes on Aug 30th The consequence is it will take me till the end of April to pay it off &amp; in the meantime I get 5 francs a Pay &amp; after that 2/- a day or 40 francs a Pay my trip to England is about 12 months put off curse the damned Army &amp; everything that sent me into it.<br/>Have got 20 francs to do me till the end of Apl. Have since made it out &amp; I find that if I draw nothing till the end of March I shall be in debt then 3/- nice to look forward to</p>
