<p>Troops still continue to pour in from the Colonies &amp; one cannot make the slightest guess as to the number of men now in Egypt.<br/>The Detention Barracks over here in Cairo &amp; Abbassia are now becoming cram jammed with Venereal Diseased men, I cant for the life of me understand what they are going to do with them in the end.</p>
<p>16.3.16 Thursday<br/>Had a hard days work.  Went out riding during the cool of the evening with S Haynes.  Old Jack turned up to-day as he had leave from Tel-el-Kebir.  They get one day every month to come up to Cairo &amp; purchase different articles.<br/>My poor old Batman "Woorack" was put in the Hospital to-day &amp; consequently I have to do everything myself.  I hope he soon comes out as I miss his well meant advice.<br/>Jack showed me a letter he received from Nina &amp; he was as pleased as punch.  The 1st Australian Division are now on the water for France so I suppose you will all soon hear of it.</p>
