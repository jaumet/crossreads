Favreuil
Turned out about 11 a.m.. A fine day and this camp seemed very pleasant its tents on good grass flats and the thick and undamaged woods of the village forming a background to it. General R. Smith came in for a yarn and the inevitable cup of tea. Put on dress uniform and went over to the 6th F. Ambulance to see the dentist. They are very comfortably located ? a band was playing. How different is this battle to that of early Somme days. Received from Gawler some postcards found on dead Germans and posted them home. Guns quieter today and only a very few big ones passed further back than here. Our men busied on cleaning off mud and on brushing themselves up. A large Y.M.C.A. canteen close by is much appreciated. Squadron of aeroplanes flew over about dusk and drew fire of the enemy's Archies. Commenced battalion mess again for the few days out and had our buglers on the job once more. A fine Last Post blown by "Muldoon" who puts his soul into his bugling
