<p>we anchored in midstream to await arrival of our collier, as the tide was very swift and strong and when collier was near she was ordered to come alongside of us,  This proved to be a very hard task and appeared very risky but after a series of vain attempts and many bumps against our side, she was eventually secured, but the swell and current proved far too strong to allow her to remain and so she was ordered to lay off in more shallow water until the morrow, to prevent accidents<br/>Mar 2nd at 5.30 am. we weighed anchor and proceeded to where the collier lay at anchor, and again owing to the same difficulties, and more especially to the continuous rolling of the collier, we had to abandon it again, and so at 9.30 am. our Captain decided to proceed to the Para River, higher up the Amazon and so carry our coaling operations there.  and we duly arrived of the town of Para at 12.30 PM; at 1.30 Brazillian officials came on board, and at 2 PM we fired a salute for Brazil, at 2.30 PM the British Consul</p>
