<p>Saturday 7 October 1916<br/>Weather changeable, spells of sunshine in the morning alternating with wild gusts of wind. In the early morning was awakened by talking &amp; commotion caused by the arrival of a German prisoner from the line : he had been taken while caught in our barb wire, &amp; found to be slightly wounded in the right wrist. A middle-aged man &amp; rather a miserable specimen.<br/>In the forenoon was warned for duty at Army H.Q. &amp; after getting things packed up waited all day for the car to come. During the afternoon completed the issue &amp; fitting of new respirators to the mobile machine gunners.</p>
