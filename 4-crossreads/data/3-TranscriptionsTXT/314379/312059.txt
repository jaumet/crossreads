 and at night we used them as an additional pillow. These precautions made us realise that we were not exactly safe and should be prepared for any emergency. A couple of days before the great event a big consultation called the ("Monster Equatorial Consultation") was got up by the officers. This was run on the same lines as the Tattersall's Sweep and five prizes were given, - 1st, 2nd and 3rd, 4th and 5th. The first prize was for the member who drew the exact time at which the first man from the Panama Coast set foot on the ship. the consultation was open to every man and the charge was 1&frasl;- each.

It was great news and it was not long before we retired to rest so as to be in good form for the treat on the morrow. It can be imagined how happy and excited we were after sailing across such a big "pond' to hear news like that. That night we also saw another big lighted steamer moving in the opposite direction and as were a "darkened" ship this had the effect of showing the other one up more brilliantly. At last the great day arrived. We were up with the sun on the following morning
