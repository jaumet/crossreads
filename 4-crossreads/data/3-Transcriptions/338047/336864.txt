<p>1918<br/>Oct 9-12<br/>did not improve, I was sent to the Battalion Hospital at Foucaucourt. This village was about the same size as Lignieres, or perhaps a larger was about 1 &frac12; kilos away. I walked over with Campbell, one of our runners and told him about the good bed that I was leaving. He said that he would see if he could take my place there. I sent word to Don McK to let the Regniers know what was wrong with me, as I thought it quite possible that they might construe my illness as something quite different. Battn HQ was in a small chateau and the Hospital was in the stables, the treatment room being downstairs, and the patients upstairs on stretchers. most uncomfortable affairs. They are not quite 6 feet long, and one cannot double up to any extent owing to the narrowness. The boils were very very bad on my back and I had a very miserable time. We had a gramophone and a few records &ndash; "when we've wound up the watch on the Rhine"</p>
