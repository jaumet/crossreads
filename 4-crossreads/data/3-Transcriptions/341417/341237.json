<p>The way we removed stores was most barefaced. All day long for the last week self-propelled lighters were busy taking impedimenta off to transports.<br/>At night they carried 400 troops each trip &amp; heavy guns &amp; animals.</p>
<p>Although we had to move men away to the transports in bright moonlight, it gave us a counter advantage in showing up the enemy, should they attack &amp; making the position defensible by reduced numbers.<br/>On the 18th Dec the Garrison was 6,000 men in Anzac position. That night 3000 were got away.</p>
<p>Now one way of reckoning an enemy's numbers is by observing the amount of rations &amp; water taken to the different positions [so] we had to keep men &amp; pack mules moving along the different communications to make things appear normal. The Indians who controlled the mules left 3 days before the end. Infantrymen took their places</p>
