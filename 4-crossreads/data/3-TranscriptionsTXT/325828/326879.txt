 Zietoun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R 8.2.16 Egypt.  1st Jany 1916 
 My dearest Father, The first day in the New Year finds us still in Egypt &amp; waiting for the word to go forward.  On Wednesday after putting in only 2 days in the Orderly Room, our lot of  12th m  12 men were sent down to the 4th Training Battalion as Regimental Detail.  These men are due to go to the Front at the shortest notice but whether we will accompany them or not I don't know.  We have been given the order to hold ourselves in readiness for anything that might turn up.  Of course although we have altered our position the address will still be the same.  I have been watching out for a letter for the last few days but so far haven't received any at all.  I am hoping to hear by the end of the week from you &amp; to hear that you are all well. Our weather here is still splendid.  It is very cold at night time but the day is everything to be desired.  We are in huts now with any amount of room.  Huts similiar to those at Liverpool but without galvanised iron at all, - built of very light soft timber with plenty of ventilation.  In addition we have a kerosene-gas lamp (incandescent) which gives a fine light.  The meals are splendid so that altogether we are very comfortable.  There is very little news.  We are all in good health, but are tired of being couped up doing nothing, 
 Must close now, with love to all at home, Your loving son, Leo
