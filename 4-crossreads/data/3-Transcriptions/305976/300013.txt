<p>over again. Scorpions bad here also snakes. Fortunately we are at present camped near water thus having the opportunity of a shower &amp; bath. Wednesday June 19<br/>Turks shelled today. Badly hit Jericho. From our camp can be seen the hills of Moab where the Turks have a strong position. In these hills the big gun known as Jericho Jane is situated.<br/>Thursday June 20<br/>Heat very bad. Turks concentrating near River Jordan. With the exception of Artillery fire the front has of late been very quiet. Heard first class lecture on Malaria.</p>
