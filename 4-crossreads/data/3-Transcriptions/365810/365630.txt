<p>I never knew of this letter for months after Julian Gale's things put in the papers.</p>
<p>1st Anzac Corps, B.E.F.<br/>France,<br/>5th December 1917</p>
<p>Dear Richards,</p>
<p>This is a line to congratulate you most heartily upon the award to you of the Military Cross in recognition of your conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty during the operations near Passchendaele on the 3rd November.  I know that when you were unable to get any information from your Machine gun groups, owing to communications being cut by the heavy enemy bombardment, you very gallantly made your way through the barrage and visited each gun, thus assuring yourself that they were all right and had adequate supplies of ammunition.  I must regret that you were wounded while performing a similar service on the following day and trust that you are making good progress towards recovery.</p>
<p>With kind regards, and many thanks for your good work,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br/>W.R. Birdwood.</p>
