<p>held today &amp; they were a success.  The 6th LH won most of the events.  I went into Cairo in the afternoon &amp; had a good hot bath &amp; came out again shortly after tea.</p>
<p>Friday 11th  Was Regtl. Orderly Sergeant.  It is a fairly easy job but the waiting about all day I don't like.  You are continuously on duty for 16 &frac12; hours &amp; it gets a bit tiresome.  I received some letters this week from Mother, Kate, Doug, Cousin Will Gordon &amp; Nell Ferguson also a pair of sox from Violet Blair. The weather in the day time is fairly warm now but the nights are still cool &amp; you can always do with a few blankets.</p>
<p>Saturday 12th  Usual cleaning up parade in the lines all the morning.<br/>I stayed in camp in the afternoon.  Attended church parade on Sunday morning &amp; went out to Abbassia in the afternoon to see Will Douglas but he wasn't in camp so returned to Cairo &amp; called on Henry Newing.  He was out, so I thought it was good enough then to get back</p>
