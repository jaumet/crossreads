Thursday 25 JulyWonderfully quiet.  Have not heard a shell apart from the Archies.
Friday 26 JulyLast night a platoon of this battalion were to take a strong post led by one of our officers.  They failed & the only casualties were two Australians, both killed, the officer & a Corporal.  Something fishy about it.  Very quiet. Change over to-night for the Battn. in the line.
