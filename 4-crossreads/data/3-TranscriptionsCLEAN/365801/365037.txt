They got some birthday honours, I notice:-Holmes, CMG (?KCMG)Lamrock, of 20th, a C.B.Wisdom, 18th, a C.B.Travers, 17th, a D.S.O.which will, I am sure give great encouragement.  The dear fellows will do well, I feel certain, come what may, for the Brigade is an excellent one, & well led.  By mail after next we ought to hear details of the engagement of 5th May.  From the lists of casualties we have on hand, I think they must they had a brisk encounter.With kind regards,I amYours sincerelyWm. J. Sherbon
