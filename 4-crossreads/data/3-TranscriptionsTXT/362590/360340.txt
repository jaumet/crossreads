20.1.16Dear Sir
I was delighted with your kind letter & in return will try & interest you for a few minutes.
I am at present at Tel el Kebir with 1st Div F.A. training & working so that our next enemy will find us a tougher problem than the last. The Camp is very quiet, far removed from any town Cairo about 80 miles is the nearest.
