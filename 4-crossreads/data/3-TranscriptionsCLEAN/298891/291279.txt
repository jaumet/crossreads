15 Sunday
Wakened by 3 a.m. by the noise of disembarkation. Breakfast at 6.30. Stood around to go aboard a couple of [indecipherable] till 10.30. Said good bye to Capt & officers of ship & others. Paddlewheel broke then ropes broken & we stood in that sun packed like herrings & finally got onto the wharf about 2 o'clock. C.O. alert to the last sent us bumping up to S.W.H. in a motor lorry. We got down town to see Flochers & report to B. Red Cross & then Dr Bennett brought me up with her in Ford car to Ostrova when we arrived sans adventure at 1.45 on Monday morning to find that a sister had died at 9 in the evening.
