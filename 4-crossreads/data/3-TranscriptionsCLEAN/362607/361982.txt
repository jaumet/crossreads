This is Bridge I cross many & many a time when walking with my Salisbury Friends. I am enclosing a view of Bourenmouth too. I walked right along the Prom. But I did not walk up the Drive. There are peculiar Cliff Lifts at either end of the Prom & I got to the top of the Cliffs in one of them. The Bathing Beach is on the farther side of the pier. I did not go on the Pier. I will do that next time D.V. It is the Prettiest place I've yet seen in England. I hope that you have quite recovered from your accident now. Well, Dad I can hardly keep awake. Regards to Otto & my old Travelling Companions. How is the Garden & the Orchard. Love to you all & Ida, Wal & the Kiddies.  From Harry.
