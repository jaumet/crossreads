<p>Revielle at 6.</p>
<p>Stables stables as usual. When we went over to attend to machines we found to our chargin that two of the machines were missing mine &amp; Norm's after looking around I found mine secreted under the Grandstand it had been ridden about 20 miles &amp; was returned OK not a sign could we find of Norm's &amp; all steps were taken for the recovery of it. Maj Williams cut up rough over it &amp; has shook us up accordingly. Lines in future will have to be kept a lot cleaner. Bill gets roared up a treat &amp; is at all times trying to shift the blame to our shoulders. I had to visit the Base depot &amp; met Joe G who is looking anything but well he informs me that he now is a Staff Serg. I then had to go to Kasr-el-Nil for [indecipherable] Home at 6 Bed at 9.15 pm.</p>
