August continued.  We were told that we were to relieve the 1st Division on the Peninsular and we all felt pleased at the idea of going into action. The Battalion was never very pleased with Heliopolis or Cairo after the novelty had worn off and the thought of being really in it made one feel pleased with things in general.The 17th 18th and 19th Battalions left late in the day and the 20th, I think formed up to leave about 1a.m. We three Platoon officers packed everything and lay down to try and get a little sleep which I am afraid was a failure. We at length fell in and very carefully called the roll and made a minute inspection of each man. We moved out amid cheers and wishes of good luck".Nearly at the end of a hot and uninteresting march we met an officer on a motor cycle who said something about the train leaving later but it turned out it left soon after we entrained. The entrainment was made in good order and saw the men fixed up as well as possible in an Egyptian train.Leaving PALAIS-DE-KUBEIH railway station we tried to find room to put our packs. the Officers car was not much better than those used by the natives, it had electric lamps but we found that they would not light and so we had to use candles.We passed through Cairo and shortly afterwards arrived at Alexandria wharf and embarked on the Saturnia. The old tub was packed with troops and the 19th Btn had already boarded. Everything was in a filthy dirty condition and the N.C.Os. had a bad time in regard to quarters until some were admitted to part of the Officers mess.Times and datesLeft Helliopolis 11.30 pm Aug. 15thArrived at Alexandria 7.30 am 16thLeft Alexandria   6.30 pm 16thOn the 17th life belt parade.Arrived Lemnos harbour onThursday the 18th at 5.30amAmmunition and iron rations issued.Arrived Anzac 11.30 pm on 22ndLanded that night or early morning. We now go back to what happened on the transport Saturnia'. We had no idea how long the trip would last as they do not take the usual route, and only had a vague idea of our destination. The ship had only just arrived back from a trip to the Dardanelles, so the Captain of the ship informed me, and so had no time to refit.
