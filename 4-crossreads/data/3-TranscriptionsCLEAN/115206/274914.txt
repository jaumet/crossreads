  
 December  1918. Thursday 12 
 Wembley and Southall. Left home early and reported back to Hospital after meeting Roy and Eve up town. Went with Eve to the Prince  of Wales, and saw Fair and Warmer. Not a bad style of show, but very little music at all. Today I have been through several examinations and inspections. Boat leaves tomorrow.  The [indecipherable] " The Naughty Wife" with Eve and O et Roy.
