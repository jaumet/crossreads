My Dear Mother
Your letter of the 14 feb reached me here OK I have sent several letters lately two parcels both of which I registered one contains a couple of trinkets of no value, it is addressed to BMI the other is a rawhide whip, I can spell the other word but you will know what I mean I had a letter from Mr Allnutt also, which I was pleased to have although I don't feel like answering it, perhaps I may there is so little to write about unless one is flying round the country on every leave day sunday this takes cash which I am glad I have not got.
