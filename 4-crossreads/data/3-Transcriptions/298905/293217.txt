<p>When I came back I had a few letters waiting for me which were very welcome.<br/>This afternoon there was a wonderful sight in the sky no less than 8 aeroplanes were fighting 5 German &amp; 3 British one big British battleplane fought no less than 3 Taube's at once &amp; fell two of them to the ground, while two more Fokker's were smashed over towards Sailly our airmen did put it on to them it was a magnificent spectacle away up in the clouds the Taubes would dive almost nose down &amp; try to ram the battle plane but to no purpose for she would dodge them by a miracle &amp; all the time she was pouring the bullets into them when the Taube's would dive at her she would turn straight on her side &amp; dodge them beautifully, bombs fell like</p>
