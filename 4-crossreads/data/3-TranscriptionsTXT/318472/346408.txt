2 July 1918TuesdayThings quiet for me today as I haven't had any Draft men to handle. Things just going along in the same old Slow way in the Depot.
1918 July 3WednesdayNothing of much account to report in the Depot. Nice fine weather. I haven't had any men to put through for Draft during the past two days so I have had a fairly Lazy time
