  
 Well, so much for that, though I'm afraid I can not give you much of an idea of how it looks & what it feels like - you have to be in it for that. 
 We had a night march last night. These come along about once a week, and we have our full packs on. Last night we left Camp & marched through Heliopolis & Abbassia & back via Palais de Koubbeh & Zeitoun Station, about 7 or 8 miles altogether. They are good, these marches, because it is nice & cool, and the flies do not trouble us nearly so much as in the day time. 
 Well, Father this will do for the time being, and if you think anyone else would care to read it, just pass it on. Much Love to all the family Your son Alan 
 I have not had any letters from home yet, though I got 3 from "other people" last Monday. A mail is due tomorrow. I may have better luck then.
