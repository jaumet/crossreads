 22.3.16 Fatigue duties until breakfast which consisted of sitting on ones haunches and debating if there were any possibilities of calling at Melbourne and the rest of our duties for the day were to feed and clean the horses. There are 340 of them I believe and only a limited number of L.H. men and all hands have to take their turn which isn't very pleasing work down in the ammonia stinking close deck especially to men who aren't accustomed to them and not knowing how to treat them. However it is all in the game and is got through easier if done cheerfully. Bed at 9 o'clock after feeding the horses and again slept well in the hammocks, which do not swing with the boat. 23.1.16 Woke up at 25 to six by my watch and kept awake until 6 and after expecting every minute to hear the "Reveille" but it didn't go until 6.25. I forgot that time changes every day on board a ship and it is rather awkward as it does not apparently change regularly. We occupied the time before breakfast with Swedish Exercises taught us by a young chap who is an expert and is going with us. I feel stiff at first but they will do any amount of good and prevent us from getting stale on the boat and I shall take every opportunity of joining in. It was our off day yesterday. i.e. We have one day fatigues next day horse duty and next more or less off and we played a good deal of bridge in the morning and after dinner we had a "washing parade" and I washed out my towel and underpants the rest of us learning signalling and Knotting and soon after tea I was in the land of dreams awakening however several times. The weather in the morning was perfect. The day fine and only a very gentle swell hardly noticeable on but during the afternoon the wind freshened and it became rather unpleasant and the boat pitched and rolled some. This was probably owing to our nearing the Australian Bight. Luckily I slept in my hammock although a lot slept on deck and were very sore about the hips next morning from rolling about. My first attempt to get into the hammock was disastrous and I unwillingly sidled sideways into a mess where some poor unfortunate had had mal-de-mer and after a wash and readjustment of the hammock I slept well but was awakened several times
