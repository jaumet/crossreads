Came back to Gabbary & drove along Mahmoudieh Canal to the Catacombs - over 2000 years old & very interesting - then to Pompey's Pillar with its 2 Sphinxes & excavations. Then back into Alex, where we dismissed the arbagi at 6 p.m. & had dinner. Attended early performance at Casino Bellevue which finished at 8.30. Back to Ras-el-Tin by garry. Whole day cost me 221/2 piastres. Very cheap.
