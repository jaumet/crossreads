<p>Dernacourt 27/11/16  Morning parade 9-11.30 was devoted to cleaning up &ndash; haircutting, shaving and washing of new clothes to take the place of worn old ones.  It is a source of great and deep dissatisfaction  - this issue of tommy tunics to our men.  Naturally their national pride rebels at wearing the British uniform when we have a National uniform of our own. Rightly or wrongly the Australian soldier looks down on the English tommy as a being inferior to him not only in physique but in intelligence also. Having these tommy tunics foisted on us we try to make the best of it by cutting off the bright buttons and sewing on bone ones.  The men only two willingly do this, and some also try to manufacture a belt but it does not add to the appearance.  Fortunately the old slouch hat saves the situation.  By lunch time the chaps were losing the exhausted and dirty "trench" look and becoming quite smart.  The whole battalion is being bathed at some big baths on the Meaulte road.  After a nice sunny morning rain clouds gathered after lunch and it became very cold and bleak.  Except for a visit to Bde HQ remained inside all day and went into the completion of establishment in regard to our specialists.  Made bombers, gunners, signallers, pioneers all up to full strength and, of our depleted coys the QC's have very few available men left.  In the evening Col. Smith came round and after an evening devoted to argument and writing sought a chaste and virtuous couch at an early hour.  English leave has been augmented and more officers sent.</p>
