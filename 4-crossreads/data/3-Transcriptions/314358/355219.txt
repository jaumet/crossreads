<p>20<br/>I was pleased to receive a letter from you written in Jany and another written in March.</p>
<p>Today I had another pleasure in receiving a letter of yours written in April.  In this there was a note from Esme and one from Sheila.</p>
<p>No letters from dear mother.</p>
<p>I know she has written but changed have put my mail all wrong.</p>
<p>You are anxious for me to get on I know but in the Army one must first take what comes, progress is slow.</p>
<p>I am with a fine lot of men and officers.</p>
<p>Have been too tired to write much lately</p>
