<p>22 August 1916 Tues<br/>Up all night. There is a canteen here run by the corps for the use of supplying incoming patients with a cup of cocoa [indecipherable] &amp; cigarettes.

<p>23 August 1916 Wed<br/>Enjoyed a fine warm bath over at the West Riding regiments baths on coming off duty at 8.am. As soon as I had breakfast I walked into Warloy about two miles away with Bridge. On the road passed several battalions of our 1st Division who were just returning from the trenches for a rest. Received a letter from home &amp; one from Joyce Walters. Suffering with a very bad attack of billiousness Major Aidy puts me off duty</p>
