<p>a bit paralysed sometimes &amp;, in fact, won't ever be fit for much work.  I got buried &amp; smothered &amp; crushed &amp; it comes on me sometimes also a slight hernia.  But I'm alright otherwise &amp; hope to be into it again soon.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>Arthur</p>
<p>P.S.  I must try &amp; get back even if its only to meet Mrs. Vol as I'm sure she'll be very nice, otherwise why should you, oh critical one, be so happy in your ideal?</p>
