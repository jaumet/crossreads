  
 at Lyons & take a train & bus back to Strand in time to get to the Hippodrome  Matinee "Joyland". A fine theatre & we get a good seat in the stalls  I thoroughly enjoy the whole performance, it is really great   The scenery, in my opinion, is the best I've seen. Having Tate's witticism is great    & the Empire Tableau is fine. Needless to say Australia's flag is much applauded also Canada's & the other Colonies   I leave satisfied. Walk to the Strand & take a taxi to Headqus & report at 5 pm. As usual a further wait  & we are to report at 5 pm to-morrow. After  obtaining a further extension of leave pass, I again accompany Lake, at his request, to his home & take the train from Waterloo  & after some more music    & another pleasant evening, have a good stiff hot lemon & whisky    & some medicine
