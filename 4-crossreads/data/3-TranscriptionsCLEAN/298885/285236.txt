for Fritz Hans & Co.
Have just heard that Fritz being quite unaware of anything that was likely to disturb the quietness of last night, was caught and surprised while one of his reliefs was in progress.
Such was the situation when the Aussies and the other Col troops hopped and now are reaping in prisoners in large numbers.  It was even a case of waiting for some of the germans to get out of bed and dressed before being taken prisoner
Also guns and material were being commandeered
