I felt glad to get out to sea again & get the heat & the smell of the natives away.  We had canvas awnings over the decks as protection from the heat & about the second day after leaving Colombo we struck some boisterous weather & the awnings had to be taken down   Everything was fixed up for rough weather but we escaped it & for the next few days it was squally & showeryOn Wednesday 31st May we noticed shoals of porpoises & a very big shark followed the ship nearly all day. As we neared land again we began to feel the heat again & we entered the Red Sea on Saturday 3rd June   We passed the port Perim & there was a warship at anchor there
