  
 The train is fairly comfortable and travels pretty fast. It does the journey of about four hundred miles in thirteen hours, so it has to keep moving. Christmas morning was one of the prettiest dawns I have ever seen. Just as it began to break I could see we were traveling through thickly timbered country and it made me think of dawn about Rylstone on the way up to home - then lights began to twinkle in some of the little mud huts as we passed, and i laughed and imagined them to be rabbiters just off round their traps. As the day began to come in properly a beautiful soft light of blended orange and purple tinged the desert hills on the horizon and then its reflection intermingled, in the slowly flowing old Nile, with the reflection of the palm trees and did look so pretty in between the rich green of the fields on either side. The country here or at least the crops are quite different from those down in the delta. Palm trees and sugar cane seemed to grow every where, and in some places barley was only just coming up, whereas it was nearly a foot high round Cairo.
