<p>Another ship to go to the bottom.  She was a French four masted Barque named "Marshal Davout" with wireless and two submarine guns.  These the "Wolf" took before sinking her that same day.  She sunk in two minutes.</p>
<p>Then the "Wolf" intended to make a run for Germany, but she first had to take coal, so she started to steam for "Trinidad Island".  She was a few days run off when she intercepted a wireless message from two English cruisers talking to each other.  One reported that "she was at Trinidad Island" and the other reported "she would be there the next day to coal".  Of course when the "Wolf" heard this she steamed well away from "Trinidad Islands".  She met the "Igotz Mendi" several days later and coaled in mid ocean.  This was about the 20th December.</p>
<p>On the 25th December, "Christmas Day" we were still in the same place.  We had a fairly good Christmas.  The Commander gave us a cigar, 3 cigarettes and a glass of punch to each man.</p>
<p>On New Years day we were near the bottom of Africa.</p>
<p>On 4th January, 1918 we sighted a four masted Barque, and the prisoners were ordered below.  It was 2 p.m. before we were allowed on deck again.  On our starboard side astern was the smoke of a steamer and on the Port side the masts and sails of a sailing ship.  A Hun sailor was standing on the boat deck of the "Wolf" with a pistol in his hand, ready to shoot anybody who tried to make signals to the sailing ship.  We then signalled the steamer "Igotz Mendi".  At 2.30 p.m. the "Wolf" turned completely about and at 4 p.m. we sighted the sailing ship again, and at 5 p.m. she was a prisoner of war.  She was a Norwegian four masted barque named "Stere Brere" meaning "Big Brother".</p>
<p>When her crew came aboard they told us they had reported to the steamer (which was the "Igotz Mendi") having passed a German Raider and warning her.  The "Igotz Mendi" rushed full speed to the "Wolf" and reported that was the reason why the "Wolf" went back.</p>
