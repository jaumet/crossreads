  
 22nd September.  Owing to a large amount of work being on hand commencing on this date it was found impossible to keep the diary up to date and so from this date a summary of events is being written. Telephonic communications was very bad at the commencement of operations on this front. I got a shed fixed up as an office which was very convenient and comfortable. The weather began to get cold and it rained frequently. At this time we had X and Z Battery in the line but we were shortly ordered to take over a front from the 3rd Canadian T.MS. extending to the VIERSTRAAT ROAD. Y 4 A Battery took over this front, it is a fairly active front as the Huns have a greater number of Mortars on this front. I find it very fatiguing inspecting the front. I have got a very good horse from Headquarters called BEN. and also another from the D.A.C. for my groom Gnr. HIGGINS to ride. The Menium batteries are placed under the groups, heavy Battery is placed under the Command of C.R.A. through the D.T.M.O. My position is that of general adviser to the Division on Trench Mortars. I still have the administration to do. Bdr. WELSHMAN proves himself a most capable and thorough man at his work. Bdr. LEEMING is doing well as the Quarter Master. I have written to try and obtain a typewriter and it is long in arriving. The typewriter at last arrives and we are trying hard to learn how to use it. I have been getting on fairly well and do most of the Routine Orders so far. I cannot obtain a typist from the Batteries. Everything is running very smoothly. I am promoted to Captain from Temp. Captain, 2Lieut Mc Pherson, Anderson, Hirst and Pinder are promoted to 1st Lieut. I have made out two good maps of the whole front and have put in the co-ordinates on all the positions. Lieut. Sherwood is promoted Temp. Captain. We have obtained 16 cases of comforts from the Australian comforts fund and also a Gramaphone. We are again ordered to take over a front called the BLUFF. Z4A Battery is taken out of the line and sent to the front and the X4A Batteries front is extended over the front Z Batty had. The 1st Australian Division are on the BLUFF front and they have built sone very good gun positions and dug-outs. They have two heavy gun positions which they are handing over to us, one of them is very badly chosen and afterwards falls in, they are not quite finished and we continue to work on them. The Heavy gun position on our original front is getting on well. I go on leave to England, I am very surprised as I did not expect to go just yet. I ride to PROSPERINE station and go to BOULOGNE, after having something to eat at the Hotel on the wharf I go on board the boat and try to obtain a cabin but cannot, the sea is rough but I do not expect to be bad as I think I have got over that trouble.
