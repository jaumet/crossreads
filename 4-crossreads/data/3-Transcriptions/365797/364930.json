<p>Chatswood<br/>May 7th 1916</p>
<p>My dear Alan,<br/>It <u>was</u> nice to get your letter about my engagement. I can assure you I feel most honoured in having a brother, who so charmingly expresses his opinion as regards his new sister. But really Alan Dene &amp; I are awfully grateful for your good wishes. We are quite old engaged people by now &amp; behave with much decorum (in public of course).</p>
<p>Out here we have heard of Niven, Noel, &amp; Cairns having arrived in <strike>Egypt</strike> France &amp; I am wondering whether you &amp; Tom are there too. Tom's last letter told of being moved from Alexandria to some far away place in the desert.</p>
<p>You have of course heard detailed accounts of the wedding long before this. We did miss you so much &amp; feel we would have given a lot to have you there. It is at such a time that one wants the whole family to be together I think.</p>
<p>It was all so awfully pretty &amp; nicely arranged &amp; Hazel looked perfectly lovely. She was married in a white coat</p>
