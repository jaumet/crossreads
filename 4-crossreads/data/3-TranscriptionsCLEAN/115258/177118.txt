  
 I did not want to cable for money as we were so near the end of the war and near to coming home, but now  it has arrived  you have sent the money I think I'll try to get to Luxor and Assuan, and to see what I can of Egypt before leaving, for good. The military allow you 4/- per day 'backseech' whilst on sick leave and you have to sign a paper saying you wont eat any govt tucker during the 14 days you are away. I received another letter from Mother today. Seemed to be great excitement when Turkey and Austria chucked it in. I'll write again soon and tell you if I get this leave, but must catch this mail now. Love to Mother & the boys. Hope you have got good rains ere this. In haste Your loving son Robert C Wilson
