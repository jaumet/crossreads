<p>Monday 6 December, 1915</p>
<p>We all went for a bit of a route march in the morning, we went about 3 miles all together &amp; had a pint of beer given to us when we got back &amp; it went well, it is the first I have had since I have been on Gozo.</p>
<p>Cards again after dinner &amp; right on till about 3.30 a.m. I am beginning to get a bit of cash back which is very gratifiying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every one gambles here &amp; it is very funny to see chaps who have never done any of it before catch the fever, after a very few sittings they are just as bad as the rest.</p>
