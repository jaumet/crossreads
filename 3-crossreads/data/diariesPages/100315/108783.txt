North and generally there is much mixup. He has got us thinking. Arranged details for our relief of the 21st tonight and fixed up guides c c.

The wind is strong and piercing and gives promise of bringing up rain or snow. In any weather except absolute sunshine the Somme is a beastly place. The village is becoming daily more and more shell battered and delapidated. We are leaving a foot washing establishment here.
