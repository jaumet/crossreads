Mch 26 passed on Port side, with all sails set & running before a stiff breeze Would like to have had the glasses on her. Church Parade at 9.15 (C of E) Rather cool on deck. S.A. parade this afternoon. Have passed several steamers, & the Gulls circle continually above & around the ship. Land has been in sight the great part of the afternoon. In many places it rises sheer from the waters edge. Here & there are detached rocky islets which form a resting place for myriad sea birds, & occasionally one sees a lighthouse or mayhap a small village the buildings showing white against their greeny brown background. The country appears to be but scantily covered with vegetation & on the summits of the hills beyond smallclumps of trees are discernible.[in margin] Sunday
27 Think the tucker & tea must have been dosed last night. Cold &
