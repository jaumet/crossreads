 23 February 1918 Saturday Marched all night back towards Jerusalem, infantry having taken over the line-  Jericho was a squalid place, dirty &amp; shops all closed- the  Major  Mayor was arrested making for enemy lines - After the low land of Jordan, the high lands of Judean Hills were perishing, Hail storms etc.  We reached Bethlehem camp at 5 am perished- Through Bethany &amp; Jerusalem by moonlight was impressive, the gold minarets showing up clearly-  A long zig-zag path by single file for 25 miles, covered with mud, we lay on the stones till daylight, glad to be making back to the warmer though wetter coast- strange to say I have no Bronchitis tho' wet.
