visitors books & had afternoon tea there, a first rate institution. Altogether was very pleased with Cambridge. At night no lights were allowed at all & it was very difficult to get along. London was not half so bad as a portion only of the lamps were obscured. Caught the 7.4 back & reached London just in time to get a taxi & rush across to Euston in order to catch the mail to Glasgow at 8.50. A small tip gave me a carriage to myself & I slept most of the way but was glad to get out once & receive a cup of tea & scone from some good ladies at 2 A.M. in the morning.
Sunday 14th Jan.
Arrived in Glasgow about 8.30 & was ushered in to a buffet & given tea & cakes after which I took a taxi to the Harpers. Went to church in the morning with them & a stroll in the evening but had to have a sleep between 6 & 8 as I could not keep awake.
