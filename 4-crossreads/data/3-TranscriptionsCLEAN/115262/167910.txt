Wednesday 23 May 1917.
Woke up & went up on deck at 5 a.m. to find that we are now well out at sea again & when sun rose at 1/4 to 7 a.m. I found we were travelling in a Nth.-Nth West course. A calm sea - hardly a ripple & boat travelling well 10 1/2 knots an hr (Log).
Physical training for 1 1/2 hrs. this morng.
The transports etc. with us now are "Port Sydney" & our escort - a Japanese Cruiser - (1 masted.) Games, lecture & a hair cut (close crop) in afternoon.
The weather today was warm & shows signs of being warmer still in a day or so.
Examined ships "log" at 4.30 p.m.
