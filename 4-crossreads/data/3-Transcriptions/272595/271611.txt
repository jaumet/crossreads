<p>23rd.  This morning as I was thinking of slipping down to Littlehampton I went round to Horsferry Road to get a reduced fare warrant, I was a bit too early so to put the time in I went round to the War Chest I had no sooner set foot inside the door than I bumps Gibson &amp; then Len Pettit &amp; Goggins who were on leave had a yarn with them then went round &amp; got my warrant &amp; round to Peel House having &frac12; an hour to spare  I am scribbling this in the writing room.<br/>Had a weary trip to Littlehampton the train was crowded &amp; I felt rotten &amp; to make matters worse I was sitting next to a woman with a howling screaming brat, the young hound</p>
