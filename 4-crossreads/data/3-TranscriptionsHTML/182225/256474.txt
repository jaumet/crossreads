<p>1916&nbsp; THURSDAY 21&nbsp;&nbsp; DEC.</p>
<p>Raining &amp; Snowing all day &amp; bitterly cold all day. About the stables all day, just fooling about. The battery went on duty in evening &amp; I was on horse picket.</p>
<p>Roumers are flying round wholesale that we leave on the 28<sup>th</sup> Dec, but dont believe them.</p>
