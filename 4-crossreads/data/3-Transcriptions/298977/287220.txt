<p>France,<br/>16th April 1916</p>
<p>Dear Dad,</p>
<p>Still going strong over here.  Must say its a jolly sight better place to be fighting in than Gallipoli.  We are at present on our spell out and having a good spell at that.  This afternoon we are going to have a hot bath.  They are a fine institution these hot baths.  A fellow comes out of the trenches, has a bath and is presented with a clean change of underclothing whilst his other clothes are put through the fumigator, so we have practically got rid of the live stock at last, and you can bet what a relief that is.</p>
<p>Received your Newspaper Cutting re the Riot of the troops in Sydney, but no mail so far from home.  Have said enough re our opinion of those sort of chaps.  Wish we had them here for a few minutes.  We are expecting a mail in every day now, so hope to do better in this.</p>
<p>We have of course shifted from the billet we were in last, in fact several times, and we are if anything a little more comfortable.  Had a long March to get here, nearly 40 miles.  The hard roads played up with our feet somewhat, but we had a very good trip extending over two days.</p>
<p>At the last billet we were in I fell violently in love (for two days only) with Gabrielle, the daughter of the house, but someone who spoke better French than I did, came along and shook her.  Wish I had paid more attention to French when I was at school.</p>
<p>For the past week it has been raining on and off every day, and by way of a variety we have a slight fall of snow about three times a week, so things lately have been pretty cold and miserable, but it has fined up again now and we are having beautiful weather again.</p>
<p>When I start talking about the weather, reckon its time I knocked off.  You can guess news is pretty scarce.  Nothing I can write about from here.</p>
<p>Am feeling tip top and fast getting fat on eggs, milk and butter.  These things are a trifle dear, but worth it.</p>
<p>Best wishes to everybody in the Office.  Hope all are O.K. and have plenty of work to do.</p>
<p>Your loving Son,<br/>Roy.</p>
