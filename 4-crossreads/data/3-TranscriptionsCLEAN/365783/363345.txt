  
 Troopship Kyarra Alexandria 17th Jan? 1915 Dear old Mrs, I have written a long letter to you to London, I addressed it London as I thought you might not get it at any of the intermediate ports.   I am sending this to Capetown, Tenerife, Plymouth & London.   It is just to tell you that we are landing here, that we will be quartered at Mena House near Cairo & that we will probably be here for about two months.   The No 2 Gen. Hosp. is to be at Mena House a large hotel quite close to the Pyramids, the other hospital units are to be quartered at different places near Cairo. I have been feeling tip top but am at times very homesick.   Fred also is A1.   I hope you have had a good & pleasant trip & that you are all A1.   Best love from Your loving old man Will P.S. I received your letters dated 9 & 15.12.14. the latter with the cutting about the vomited lettuce slug & the message from Mrs. Langer Owen. W.H.R.
