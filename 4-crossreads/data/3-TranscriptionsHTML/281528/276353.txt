<p>25/3/18 [25/4/18] <br/>Some Hun raiders are lying dead out in front of our posts.  Some had a kind of tomahawk.  Our chaps found a body with the tomahawk close alongside.  On the body was a good finger ring.  Billjim broke the bone of finger and tore it about trying to wrench off the ring.  Said he afterwards "I had to leave it.  I didn't have the heart to chop the finger off."</p>
<p>Said one chap "I see the m.g's are killing thousands of Huns down South".  "Yes", said his mate, "it must be terrible, fancy having to rat all the bastards!"</p>
