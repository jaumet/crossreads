We had to stop where we were, that was our objective.Our little party was rather mixed so we all went off in different directions to find our platoons. Mine was only about 200 yds away so I had no difficulty in reaching them. They were occupying a little trench infront of a grave yard. There were only 15 left. I got a position in the spell trench and sat down for a good spell.Although a lot of digging was to be done everyone was very tired and thought a spell would not do any harm first.In this way the covering defences of the Hindenberg Line were broken after about 4 hours work. The wire was enormous but they all got through it. Nothing stopped the boys at this stage.
