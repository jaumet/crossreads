  
 Asking for an explanation, here we found that we should have gone to the Anzac Water Convoy Camels not the C.T.C. (as it expressly directed).  Thither we repaired & got our three camels & took them to the 2nd L.H.F.A. & I loaded them up, while Riches went back to Khan Yunis to get our blankets etc.  Then I brought them back here (the Anzac W.C.C.) & here we are living having made a house out of the load of stuff.  What we are going to do next Lord knows, however we are very comfortable here with natives looking after our horses & nothing to do. Our front line trenches are about 3 miles ahead & occasionally there are outpost scraps & artillery duets but otherwise things are very quiet.  Curiously enough, though they have a splendid target so far the taubes have not bombed us & I am told they have not done so for weeks!  Why I don't know.
