1915July 18 Sun.Went into Cairo in the afternoon after a couple of parcels from Sydney but the Parcels Office had closed at noon. The day was not extra warm but a thermometer in a shop registered exactly 100 (about 3 p.m.).Very thirsty weather - to-day got through 2 Lime drinks, 2 Ice creams & a lemonade.
