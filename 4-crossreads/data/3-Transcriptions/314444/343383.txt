<p>Dear Mum</p>
<p>I received a very welcome letter from you and you dont know how I felt at getting it. I was in the trenches doing Observation duty through a periscope, &ndash; (a thing with 2 glasses in it) when a lad came behind me and sang out, a letter for you Brett. I had to wait till my time was up before I could read it, But I knew that only one hand in the universe wrote that way. I have been in the firing line now about 7 weeks.  I have been in one Bayonet charge. We were placed in the 2nd Battalion as soon as we arrived in Gallipoli. <strike>Once</strike> on about</p>
