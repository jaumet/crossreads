  
 Am advanced in a good many ways. - a little firmer in character - less prodigal with money - more inclined to do any work at hand - and  happier  Great lapses from time to time, but am fighting as hard as I ever fought before to once  & for all make something of myself.  The glimpses I get from time to time of what I might become if I persevere make the fight well worth while. 
 Yesterday we attended a brigade battle manoeuvre Reveille 5 AM, moved off 6.15 & picked up 3 battalions marching about 3 miles from here.
