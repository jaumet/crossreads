<p>28th January 1917. Woke at 8 &amp; had breakfast. Fixed up the joint. Germans shelled round our position today without materially damaging anything. Went on duty at 5 &amp; came off at 8. While on duty the biggest "strafe" took place. Our guns and all the batteries on this sector started firing at 6 oclock &amp; left off at 7.30. Poor old Fritzy must have had a rough time. Fritzy retaliated in the shape of shelling our trenches. Got some letters from home tonight  Went to bed pretty late. Am on duty at 4 &ndash; 6 in the morning.</p>
