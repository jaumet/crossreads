We went through the above village when we moved off until we struck a towpath which led up to a pontoon bridge put across by the Engineers. The little village is ruined and overgrown with weeds having been one of those destroyed by the bombardments of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. The canal has silted up and weed grown. We passed several groups of prisoners making for the rear some of them walking along carrying wounded unguarded inquiring the way as they went along. Fritz has a couple of balloons up and is strafing parts of the route we will be going over so perhaps we may have to get into artillery formations later. In any case I intend breaking down into half platoons as soon as we cross the bridge. Moved off again at 1.30 and got up to close to Clery sur Somme. The 21st Bn their transport
