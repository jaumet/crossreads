 Wed. Feb. 16th -16 Visited Mahommed Ali's Mosque and the Citadel.  Wonderful sight and luxuriously carpeted inside.  Has 2000 lights.  Built over 100 years ago of solid alabaster procured from the Pyramids and the Nile.  There are over 50 Mosques in Cairo but Mahommed Ali mosque is the chief one. Also saw Joseph's well.  It has a depth of 200 ft. but on looking down is appears very much deeper.
