  
 The Church and Convent are very pretty and were situated right opposite  our hotel. We caught the 2 a.m. train back to Armidale on Sunday night and arrived here at 6 a.m. very tired by well satisfied with our holiday. The train travelling did not cost us anything so our trip wasn't a very expensive one. I am enclosing a few more photographs which will probably be of interest to you. I am not sure whether I have not already sent you some of them. As tea has just begun and I go on duty immediately afterwards I must now close. Excuse scrawl. With best love to all at home and next door Your loving son Eugene.
