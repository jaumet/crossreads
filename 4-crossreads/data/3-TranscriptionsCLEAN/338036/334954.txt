About 3 pm our lorries arrived & we were soon on return journey.  Passing thro Wimereaux (it was Sunday & the towns are looking their best) we came at length to Boulogne.  It was just like holiday time & the dressing was quiet OK. A British band was playing at the beach and except for the fact that 'Kahki' & blue were in evidence we would hardly realise a war was on. We arranged for the drivers to stop here an hour to give us a chance to look round and it was worth it.  The beach was very pebbly & not up to the aust beaches.  We left Boulogne about 6 and when we arrived at Devres via Wisquenes [?] it was quite dark.  We pushed on after 10 minutes spell and arrived back at Ecurie about 9 pm.  The news on arrival was not too good as we were led to believe that the Division would be going back to lines again in a few days.
