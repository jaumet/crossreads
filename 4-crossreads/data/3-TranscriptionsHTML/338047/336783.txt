The Hun had not had time to get his big guns out of here. Our Artillery was using a couple of his big howitzers, shooting back at Fritz with them. Fritz however had fixed up some of his guns so as to render them useless. One was already to fire. Our Artillery put a string into the trigger, got into an adjacent dugout and pulled. The gun went off all right but the barrel had been loosened from its fastenings, and slid backwards and half buried itself in the ground. A big 9.2 Howitzer was in the valley that was firing on one of his railway centres. I stood behind it one day to watch it go off. I saw the shell leave the barrel and go high up into the air until it looked about the size of a marble.<br/>13 Aug<br/>I forgot to mention that on 13 August, before coming to Morcourt valley we had a parade before Generals Hobbs and Tivey.
