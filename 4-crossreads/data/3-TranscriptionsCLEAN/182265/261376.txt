6.10.17 Have a slight cold so have just had a hot rum & condensed milk & got to bed. Raining nearly all day. Went for a long walk this evening for exercise. Very muddy & slushy. Took 6 men over to Kruisstraat Farm to act as runners for Signallers. Inspected men's feet, all O.K. Received a big mail today for the company. I received 5 from Joy. Wrote to J - the 6th time this week. Read magazine.
