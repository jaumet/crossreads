<p>this pretty little town, &amp; to do some shopping for the boys in the desert. Had about &#163;3/-/- worth of eatables to purchase for the boys. Quite enjoyed walking in &amp; out of the shops. Addison treated me my dinner at the biggest hotel that we could find in our travels, &amp; "by jove" we did eat. Quite a treat to have a good 7 course dinner in comfort. A walk along the native quarters was very interesting, and very dirty, it is really an experience to visit the Arabic quarters you cannot realise the filthy state of the dwelling etc.. On walking down the streets one can almost with arms stretched out tough the ramshackle buildings on each side of you.  In some places the streets are so narrow that I hardly think that the sun's rays ever penetrate along the footpath. The stench in some places along these alleys is very unpleasant, sanitary arrangements well, there are none. It is no wonder that disease lurks here, I can't imagine how the natives live under these conditions. Of course this is the lower class of Arab, the refined Egyptian are really a very nice class of people, in some cases it is hard to tell whether they are French or Egyptians. They live in fine dwellings. Slept in one of the wards of the hospital.</p>
<p>Tuesday 2nd Feb.<br/>Took a walk through the Ismailia Gardens on the way to the launch, they are almost as good as the Botanical Gardens. Launch left at 8 a.m., beautiful</p>
