<p>18.12.16<br/>Arose about 1-20 last night but didn't leave until 1210. taking bottle of tea, chocolate &amp; gas helmet and tin hat. Hudson led way with a lantern through 5th Division duckboards. Very dark and my torch was useful. In Delville Wood we [doused the glim] and went on a single line of boards. Everything was desolation and at length we came to a tram track which we followed past an R.E dump &amp; then over country to our job. A little on the right of Flers High Wood. Got to work and put in the first set as well as got ready for the next and covered our work with sandbags. Only 2 shells fell near us but the opposite side of the Wood was heavily shelled all night. Guns were going all night. Left at 6 and</p>
