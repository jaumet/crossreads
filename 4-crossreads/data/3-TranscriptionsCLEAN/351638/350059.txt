I think the answer is to be found in the faith placed in the fire of ships' guns of large calibre on field works and their demoralising effect on the enemy's infantry. Otherwise, the position chosen for the disembarcation are extremely difficult of explanation. By landing at the Southern extremity of the Peninsula the army was at once brought up against a series of positions of extreme natural strength, all of which would have to be taken by assault before Kilid Bahr on the European side of the Narrows, which was apparently the original objective of the army, could be reached.
