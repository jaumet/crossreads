<p>here that you have heard of before.<br/>For instance there is one of the Bartons from Wellington here, a trooper in the 6th, he is a returned man having done 19 weeks in Gallipoli and then got enteric.<br/>Then Rostron knows Miss Miller &amp; also the Crossings; his people have Uliwah Coonamble, near Wingadee.<br/>There is also a man named Keer who lived on Oakey Creek and knows Dick White.<br/>His father and old McAllister worked their passage out from England on the same boat he says.<br/>Of course there are some awful wasters here but there are tons of good men to make up for them.<br/>I must go to bed now.</p>
<p>Sunday 21st<br/>It is still as calm as ever and has been raining most of the day; we have really had a wonderful calm trip.<br/>Wonder how the rams are getting on; I suppose by the time you get this they will be at the sales.<br/>I wish you many happy returns of your birthday and I hope the rams bring a record price. I will be awfully anxious to hear about it. When are you going to get the car?</p>
