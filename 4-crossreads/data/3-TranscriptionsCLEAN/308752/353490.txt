Just about time too,  three days under such conditions was rather long. You should have seen the way we moved when we knew we were going back.  It amuses me these pictures in the Sydney mail etc. - note the eager look in the faces of the men as they go towards the Line to deal with the enemy, but you should have seen us when we knew were were relieved. We were lucky enough to have a lift to the Dressing Station & here we received orders to proceed to some big dugouts in on arriving there we enjoyed a good hot meal & turned in straight away.

He has never missed a turn in the Line & although wounded slightly at the crater, he carried on & would not leave until the whole Ambulance was relieved. Who should I meet in my travels but Reynolds from Neutral Bay & Stoddard from Hooper & Harrisons. I certainly have a lot to be thankful for coming out of the ordeal quite safe. I thank God with all my heart for my safety.Unfortunately we were not be left alone in quietness for long at 11 p.m. on the 17th inst.
