<p>Wed. July 4 (Assault at Arms) cont)<br/>Our First Aid Squad did very well, too,  If anything was at all doubtful it was our Stretcher drill.  [Barny?] gave the orders in an uncertain manner, which resulted in the movements being a bit ragged.  Every man was a trier, though.  It was a very interesting programme, &amp; the Anzacs showed up very well.  Birdwood &amp; a score of lesser lights were present.  Our Cooks brought out a Copper &amp; made us some Tea, so we had Dinner on the Grounds, &amp; made quite a picnic of it.</p>
<p>Thur. July 5th  They gave us the day off, after about an Hour's Gas drill.  We played Cricket &amp; I did some washing.  A job I detest.  Received Pipe from Mac; who is at Weymouth.</p>
<p>Friday. July 6th   Received Letter from Ruth.  Went for route march with Maj. Wooster through the villages of Hedauville &amp; Forceville.  We had a good spell in a deep forest, which was very cool.  On our way back we passed a big bunch of cavalry.  They went by at the trot, &amp; presented a very fine appearance.  Played Cricket after Dinner.  Commenced Letter 24 to Lill.</p>
