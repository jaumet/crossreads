<p>Dear Mum,</p>
<p>It is a fortnight since I wrote a letter.  I only write on Sundays &amp; I was staying with Jennie last Sunday &amp; I only sent a P.C.  We have the Spring right here now &amp; the weather is just glorious.  I have to have the windows open all day.  It is just perfect.  I intended to take a walk this afternoon but some of the Heads are coming to have a look around this afternoon &amp; I am forced to stay right here.  I will answer your four letters as under before I tell you of my trip to Grimsby, 23/12/17, 31/12/17, 6/1/18, 27/1/18.  All came to hand within a few days of one another.  I notice that you have been to see the Picture of the "Deemster".  Auntie &amp; Marie were in the crowd on Tynwald Hill for the Picture Play the "Manxman".  You would not be able to pick them out.  I am without clothes now that my last suit has gone.  But the suit</p>
