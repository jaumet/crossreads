 October 17 63. To Ouderdom tonight with Frank for the washing we left there last week&hellip;. 
 This afternoon no parade.  In one of the low mansard huts, an hour listening to musick&hellip; George practising some Hungarian Folk Songs he bought in London, Jack playing the Dulcetone.  Songs with lovely and quaint melodies&hellip;.full of passion and exotic loveliness&hellip;.  I leaned against the side of the hut, and imagined a nice setting&hellip; a white highly ceilined room&hellip;. big windows, and white walls&hellip;. the half light of early night, and a soft light for clustered candles&hellip;. a concert grand reflecting on its black ebony wood the light of the candles&hellip;. the soft interrupted singing of George, and the repetition of difficult melodies&hellip;&hellip; the pauses of easy interested discussion, and the [indecipherable] sung again, in the melody replayed, and myself in a deep great comfortable chair, leaning back from some lovely book &ndash; of verse or drawings, and a cigarette smoking unerringly and softly blue between my fingers, lost in the [indecipherable] and beauty of the moment's mood. 
 No mail today.

 October 19 Betty's Birthday Last night a dinner to the unit from canteen funds.... judged by hilarity and beer consumed it was a compleat success.  The Troops shipped&hellip;. to be vulgar.  But for sheer enjoyment such a dinner and night can only be spent by a small company, twenty congenial spirits at most.  Becordel stands in our memory as the greatest of enjoyed nights&hellip; and of all that were there&hellip;who are left:  Clarrie, Toby, Bill, Fell, McNeil &amp; Sol.  The others dead.  P.B. back in Australia or in Blighty.
