at seven fifteen for Alexandria Station.

Thousands of bales of cotton were lying at the station. This cotton is grown in Egypt.

Huge tracks of country are covered with water.

Large numbers of native labourers are making roads and digging the canals deeper.

This part of Egypt is splendidly irrigated by a splendid system of canals.

Impressions this time are pretty much as I have already described in the earlier part of my diary.

No hedges or fences divide the various fields one from another, the furrow seems to mark out the field.

Oranges are in great demand by the "boys" and are eagerly bought up by them from the native sellers at the various stops on the way. The familiar o-ran-ges "Eggs are cooked", of the natives sounds extremely amusing.

Along the road which runs by the side of the canal and railway little buildings like monuments are placed at intervals of a few miles. There seems to be wells placed there to quench the thirst of the travellers who seem to be numerous along the way.

We saw a number of native youngsters holding a net in the canal. How fish could live in such water I cannot understand. The water is so very muddy. Travelling rapidly in the train one could not see what kind of catch they were getting.
