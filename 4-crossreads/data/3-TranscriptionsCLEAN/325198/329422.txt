Its a wretched day, cold & windy, the sand cuts ones eyes out - Bill Talford & I made a billy of soup with a couple of peasoup sausages - it was just the thing but dinner was not exactly a success as there is too much sand blowing.  We tried a game of bridge but between wind & sand we had a rough spin & had to turn it in - I wonder what this year will bring? its sure to be eventful; not many would be game to profecy where or how we will be situated  next New Year.  I sincerely hope we will be away out of the Sinai sands before then.  I think we will. 
 Bayoud 6 pm What a day its been to be sure, if to day is a sample of the year, then 1917 will be a corker.  The desert has been turned back to front to day, the hills with straight backs to the south have straight backs to the north now & curves to the south.  The track was obliterated for our return, our eyes & faces were cut with the sand, it was murder.  The camp looks like as if there had been a snow storm over it, its all covered with fresh white sand
