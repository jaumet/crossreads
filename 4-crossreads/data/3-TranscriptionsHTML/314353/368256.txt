<p>November 17, 18<br/>Tonight in the Billet a long yarning with Serg. Sellers, Norm Reid's successor &ndash; and Seller's old friend. ,,coming to the Amb. to take Norm's place, he had no idea whose place he was filling&hellip;.  A yarning that brought Chaddy's name in it &ndash; and men that have died of the war&hellip;.</p>
<p>So far from the war that only rarely, faintly over the hill, comes the low long pulsation of the tired guns.. like the low beating of wind in old trees&hellip;</p>
<p>BOIS ST.JULIEN.  November 18</p>
<p>132.<br/>Leaving Ecuire at 8 a.m. on arriving here to the worst Billets we've been in since April 1916 at 2 p.m. &hellip; However the Aristocrats granted early the pick Billet, and so "alls well".</p>
<p>The Day splendid for marching &ndash; full 'pack-up'&hellip;</p>
<p>Report says we are the first troops billeted here with these peasants,&hellip; at any rate Madame has a deal to learn.. already a barrel of cider &ndash; full flavoured fine stuff &ndash; found in a cellar, is emptied to the dregs&hellip;  Her supply of eggs and coffee exhausted&hellip; to her credit though a great well stored harvesting of potatoes..and the troops enjoy nothing so well as "chip potatoes"&hellip;.  Turning in early, for a reading of Good Friday.</p>
<p>November 18, 19, 20<br/>133.<br/>November 19<br/>A day to write up tomorrow.  Evening now &ndash; cold in a windy billet where anywhere not deeply between covering blankets is impossible.</p>
<p>134.  November 20.<br/>Two days of no sun&hellip;.  A mail last night &ndash; a charming little note from Bernice Edwell, and a forwarding note from Mother, Sept. 2&hellip; written the day before her letter I received at Renescure a few nights back.  Mother writes of four books arriving from Edinburgh, since Betty's book arrived two must be from Beaumonts, two from Edinburgh being the two I left in a sweet shop by the Hotel.. just leaving Edinburgh for York.  The four will be Stephen's "The Rebellion in Ireland" and a book of poetry &ndash; both read in the train to Edinburgh and Craig's Art of the Theatre and a book of Symons essays.</p>
<p>Today payed &ndash; drew 50 F., Tigne Lee paying:  he back from attachment to A.D.M.S.  A big batch of new reinforcements arrived during pay, played in by bagpipes&hellip; says Bib, "They've got a &ndash; hyde 'eh?"</p>
