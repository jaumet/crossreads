  
 'Send the man'!! - Not much, said I - I take no orders from the military - "the junior service" - It's like their damned cheek - Quite right - said Fitz who had come up - "I'll complain to the Administrator" which he very promptly did - He's Senior Naval Officer & I'm Senior Naval Surgeon at Rabaul & they've got to treat us - only one way - & that's the right way - with respect - Mind you - as I told Fitz - We've had nothing in the way of a request - written or otherwise - It will all wash out of course - in our favor - 
 The Military  medical administration  is the weakest - feeblest thing, I've ever seen - The Ward room says I shall get the Iron Cross for obstinacy & strong mindedness - Anyway I'm careful to do all I can myself & I consult Fitz on naval points & then Mr Bumpus & I feel I have a little power in my own line to run my own show - successfully -
