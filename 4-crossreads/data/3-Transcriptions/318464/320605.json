<p>The silence was started again on Dec/17/15 and next day I went on guard in the mine that had been driven from Turks Head.  It was charged with three tons of ammonal, and in the drive where the Turks had heard working, five bags of guncotton were placed.  It was a case of who would "blow" first, the Turks, or us.  If the Turks had "blown", it would have exploded our mine, and settled a few tons of earth on our chests.  The next day (Dec/19/15) the evacuation took place, late in the afternoon, and I was in the second last party to leave the Top.  We went down by way of Reserve Gully, getting on board the motor lighters by means of the wharfs which were covered in sawdust, so as to deaden our foot falls.  We boarded the H.M.S. Mars, at half past six;  it being beautifully clear and moonlight at the time.  The darkness fell here at 5 oclock.  The last men left the next morning at half past three and all mines were then exploded to destroy the trenches.  Everything was highly successful as there were no casualties, or accidents.</p>
<p>The evacuation was a marvellous piece of work especially when one considers it was from a 15 mile front;  it reflected great credit for those responsible for the scheme and those who carried it out.  Seventeen weeks to the very day, had been spent in these parts and we left with very few of those, who marched away gaily from Liverpool, N.S.W.  Weakened with dysentery and jaundice, and a lot of us wearing long beards, myself included, a rough mob, we must have appeared to those on board the H.M.S. Mars.  The sailors could not have been more kind to us, for we received plenty of coffee, fresh bread etc. and were made comfortable for the night.  I stood on the deck watching the few lights recede from view with mingled feelings of regret.</p>
