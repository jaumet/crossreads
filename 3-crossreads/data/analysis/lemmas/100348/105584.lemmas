 3/7/16 . Crept about in No Man ? Land for an hour . We captur a Hun sniper , who has been troubl us for some time , he drop from a willow tree almost on top of one of our chap , who was arm to the teeth , but he forgot about all his lethal weapon , and punch the Hun in the eye , then gave him a shower of uppercut that knock him out . He was a Bavarian a rough look joker too ; dress in tweed trouser and a blue butcher coat . As we were return to our line a machin gun caught us and one of our chap was kill . This machin gun is oper by the crack German gunner on this front . He is known as " Parapet Joe " and I must say that if he could express his talent on a violin he would be call a genius . A veri wild night , shell of everi calibr rain down on our line .
