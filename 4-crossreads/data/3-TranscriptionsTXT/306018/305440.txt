 June 1917 fairly strenuous time.  We were paraded to the doctor this morning &amp; examined.  He put me on a weeks medicine, 3 times per day  I have to go &amp; get it.  First day I forgot twice  In the afternoon went for another swim in the lake.   A large number of Australian reinforcements to the Light Horse detrained here &amp; marched into the Isolation Camp.  Noticed several old faces familiar in the original regiment back again 
 Thursday 21st Was out at 4 am.  Parades had to be away by 4.30 am.  Breakfast at 8 oclock, so you feel it very long &amp; get very hungry in the 4 hrs.  The days are very warm.  The swim in the Lake every afternoon is a treat.  Tommies in thousands are arriving also guns.  The place is absolutely full of them.  They have come over from Salonica &amp; they reckon they were glad to get away from there  On Saturday there was a big aquatic sports carnival.  The finals were all run off.  There was a large attendance  The Anzacs did particularly well taking nearly all the important events.
