<p>cars &amp; station by A.D.M.S. &amp; heads.</p>
<p>Friday 15th<br/>    Needing exercise &amp; wishing to examine some graveyards I decided to walk to B. Section who are at Kandahar Farm about 3 miles.   Walked across the fields in parts &amp; saw that we had completed a lot of ploughing.  This work is being done in this area by soldiers.   All the horses which can be spared are used and central dumps for manure have been made.   Tractors are also used and large areas are being ploughed which would otherwise be wasted owing to there being no civilians about.  Had dinner at Kandahar &amp; then proceeded onto Neuve Eglise (much knocked about) to the office of the G.R.U.    They looked through all their papers for Dave Drummonds grave but could give me no information.   I then ran up through sigs, the D.A.D.G.R.&amp; E but they also could give me no information.   Set off for home then getting a lift by a motor lorry.   Weather very cold.</p>
