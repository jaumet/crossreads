 30/5/18  Franvillers 
 Another lovely day.   Old Habel the mess corporal had very rashly spread the mess table fair in the middle of the crop just behind the trench and it was right under view of the Hun.   I went into the village where the official Photographer took my portrait for our Regimental history.   Met Dr MacMahon and with him commenced a round of inspections finding the usual little irregularities.   While at A Co a Hun plane came across and flew very low.   Our Lewis guns engaged him heavily and brought him to the earth undamaged to a place about a mile off on a small rise.   At once the very earth seemed to vomit men as Billjims from a hundred dugouts scattered over the landscape rushed up towards the 'plane.   They were like wolves round a carcass.   The Hun was unhurt and was taken away in a motorcar to D HQ.   After lunch Colonel Cohen and Major Clowes came and we sat as a Court of Inquiry and made our findings re the artillery.   After mess I went across and saw James of the 24th.   The view from here across to Villers Brettoneux was fine Corbie lying in the wooded river valley and was covered with smoke.   The Hun put a good many shells into Franvillers  and wounded 2 bandsmen there.   I saw one being carried out on a stretcher as I returned from the 21st where I had been talking to Colonel James.   Received orders to take over up the line from 28th Bn tomorrow night.    Preparations &amp; writing took till midnight.
