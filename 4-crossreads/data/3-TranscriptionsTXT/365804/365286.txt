to my daughter in London writes of Bert ;-He had successfully lead his men to the second line of enemy trenches and on the parapet of his 2nd line called out to them "Come on lads! Only another trench to take." When a machine gun bullet struck him and killed him instantly. His adjutant was killed at the same time. He died a hero's death and you will be able to tell your child late how brave his father was above all how noble and conscientious a Catholic.
Such a letter must be the sweetest balm to my dear bereaved daughter. To whom I have already given your kind message of sympathy. Nothing is more consoling than a kind letter and I have read yours many times and we all thank you for it.
I was glad to read in todays Telegraph futher [indecipherable] to the conspicuous bravery of your gallant son whose conduct would have entitled him to many honours if he had been spared to bear themYours very sincerelyJohn lane Mullins
