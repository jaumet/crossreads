streets, in several large Cafes, music was being played and singing, and as it was after soldiers hours, I did not venture inside any of them.
It was snowing very heavy and I arrived back well covered over with snow and once more to bed.
Monday 27th
Am still waiting for the engine.
Tuesday and Wednesday we were still awaiting the engine and on Thursday 30th we received word to light the engine up and depart for Calais at 6 pm with an empty leave train of German coaches.
After several delays at the station we finally got away at 8 pm and as usual the delays enroute took place. After being relieved and taking up duties again we arrived at Somain early Saturday forenoon and after a Pilot was supplied by the R.O.D. we left and I had a good opportunity of viewing the battlefields between Somain and Arras, and there is no mistake the country between these two towns is knocked about shocking. Villages after villages were reduced to ruins, hardly a house fit to live in and practically no civilians about at all, only a French soldier here and there.
