Fri. June 15. At Tea time the mob in our Mess drank my health - in tea – unfortunately. Johnnie Maggs returned from Hospital, also Nick Cox. Our Cricket Team played the return match with the 3rd C.C.S. & lost by 9 runs after a most exciting game. Bunny Allen was top score of our side – 41. Busy packing up ready to move off tomorrow.

Sat. June 16 Left Bapaume Turned out at 5. A most ridiculous hour, as we did not leave till midday. Marched to Bapaume Station. Conveyed in Cattle Trucks. Arrived at Varennes. Detrained there & marched on about 5 miles to Senlis.
It is a pretty little spot. Our Camp is on the side of a Hill overlooking the village. After Tea we went for a stroll & had some refreshments at a Café.

Sunday June 17 Glory Alleluia. Mail came in. Got 5 letters from France, 1 from Mother & 3 from M.S. Got some writing ahead of me now. Told off as Sanitary Corporal. Got Nigger Bowden, Snowy Atherton, Archie Deed & Donovan in my squad. All good workers. This is a very pleasant little camp.

Monday. June 18. More mail came in Got wedding Cake from Nell Distributed it amongst our mob. Capt Irving left us today. He came on parade & wished us all Good Luck & said "Goodbye". The mob are very sorry to lose him & gave 3 hearty cheers & sang "jolly good fellow". He is going to a Base Hospital in England. Got Letters from Lizzie Rowley & Mrs Jack B. Gee! I don’t know how I’m going to answer all these letters.
