 Saturday 26 January Usual camp routine.  A Walk to Neuve Eglise on beautiful day. Tonight I watched a P.M. on a case of alcholic poisoning.  The first I have seen &amp; last I want to see. 
 Sunday 27 January Nothing at all happened to-day. It has been foggy &amp; cold all day. We move in a couple of days but only just behind Ballieul.
