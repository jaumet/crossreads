  
 France. 5/2/1916 [there is a cross and note, possibly in another hand, indicating that the date is actually 1917] My dear Father. 
 Was feeling very blue yesterday till I got your ever welcome letters of Novr 21st   and   Dec 12th  the first for ten days and I was beginning to wonder what had happened as Sis wrote some days ago and told me she had forwarded them - mails are very irregular here
