Sunday 23rd [April] To commemorate the Anzac Landing it was decided to hold a sports meeting on 25/ between 4th 11th 12th ALH Regts and the men have been practicing tentpegging etc but it is all knocked on the head for we have our marching orders for Wednesday. My brother was out to see me before he returned to Serapeum. I have made out a fresh transfer for him.
Monday 24th Busy packing my drugs in morning in readiness, in p.m big muster parade on marching order, it was the first parade I have been on for twelve months. I was put in charge of head quarters and marched my squad out and when inspected the Col blew my head off for not having my men properly equipped but it is a way of the army, I never saw the men before and they were just put in to make up . At night I went to Cinema with Gwennie.
Tuesday 25th April Commemoration Service in Cairo and big ceremony at Anzac Hostel. We could not participate as we were packing up all day and were busy. 
General leave was granted in pm went to say goodbye to Mrs O?R.
Wednesday 26 Reveille at 4.30 all my gear was packed on Maltese waggons and was ready to go when first party left. I was in second party and in charge, instead of marching down put my party in gharries and drove to Helmich where after a lot of bother got all our stuff on board and we did not reach Tel-el-Kebir until 1.30, then we had to unload the train in a temperature of 111 we then went out about two half miles right into the desert and not a thing was done not even horse lines put down, however things eventually righted. Went to sleep under Maltese waggon and woke to find the mules had eaten part of my bedding.
