<p>S.S."Malwa"<br/>23rd Dec. 1915.<br/>My very dear Father &amp; Mother,<br/>As I write we are in sight of the Arabian coast and in another twelve hours or so expect to reach Aden.  Christmas Day we should spend in the Red Sea.  To-morrow here I shall be picturing you all and wondering just what you are doing with your Xmas Day, it will have to be to-morrow you see because you are more than eight hours ahead of us.<br/>Before I go any further let me apologise for my writing in case it becomes awful for the old Malwa is jerking furiously.  I think she must have extra steam up or something for the jigging is absolutely cruel.<br/>I posted to you from Bombay, I wonder were you surprised to find that we called there, we were ourselves.  It was about 12 o'clock by the time we got ashore, Sunday it was.</p>
