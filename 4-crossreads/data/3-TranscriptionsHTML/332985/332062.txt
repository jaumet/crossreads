<p>high velocity shells over this evening.  400 rounds of ammunition to go to Bty.  A bit of a stunt coming off.  My Corp. on English leave.</p>
<p>2-1-1917<br/>Still a few shells flying about.  Weather dull.  Terrific bombardment.  Another Vet. Officer, Major O'Gorman.  The Salvage Corps working here collecting 18 pdr. cartridge cases.  A few time shrapnels over.  9 remounts recieved.  Fine looking horses.</p>
<p>3-1-1917<br/>Horses and men from D.A.C. to take ammunition to gun position 7-30 p.m. did not get there, lost 5 horses and ten boxes of ammunition in the mud.  Only one man got to guns.  One of our horses stuck in shell hole, went up with rations, sending 2 horses to pull him out.  Bty. getting shelled.</p>
<p>4-1-1917<br/>Raining the best part of day.  Tonight is bright, aeroplanes up, search lights trying to pick them up.  Huns driven back.  No shooting by the Bty. this last two days.</p>
