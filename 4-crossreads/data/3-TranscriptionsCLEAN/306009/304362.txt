  
 1915 June 25 Fri. Tucker has been getting pretty bad & as the result of our growling suddenly became better to-day . For dinner we got tea, cold meat, potatoes, veg. marrow, tomatoes, cucumbers & rock melon - & steam pudding. How's that for active service? Attended weekly-meeting of Scouts at 7 p.m. How different these Scouts are from Australians, nothing like the cordiality & warmth. The  English here are pretty reserved.
