  
 This is a very scrappy Diary - written in all kinds of places and under all kinds of conditions.  Some of the parts are written in pencil & are almost faded or rubbed out.  You will notice that I have been trying to ink it over in some of these places.  But although it is very scrappy & dirty & untidy I will be able to tell you lots of things with it to refresh my memory that I might not otherwise be able to think of.  I hope it will reach home safely. 
 Love from Your EM
