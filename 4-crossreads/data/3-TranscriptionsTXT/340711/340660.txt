Friday, 20.This is the Ward of Serious Sergical cases. Paddy a rale Oirishman, had his leg amputated at the thigh yesterday. He has a nurse watching him night and day. And when they dress him, a doctor is present at each occasion, it is terrible to hear him. Quite half a dozen of the others almost shriek with the pain of dressings.
Saturday, 21.One poor beggar next me---is an American who crossed the border to enlist. He has most of the right elbow shot away and has to be dressed two or three times a day. He almost faints with pain.
