<p>64<br/>hut. I was allocated to No 5 Platoon "B" Company. After settling in amongst the chaps I went for a stroll around the Battn coming across a fair number of the chaps who had left Australia with me. Owing next morning to being late on parade I was put on a guard. The best dressed man was allowed off &ndash; I didn't win.</p>
<p>My first experience of O.A.S. [on active service] was a rather nervy one. Here I was in the middle of the night patrolling a set out beat and having in my mind the thought that I might at any time be set upon as a spy in the camp. I will say here that we were a matter of 10 or 12 miles back from the Ypres Sector.</p>
<p>We had one chap on the guard sent or clink as it was</p>
