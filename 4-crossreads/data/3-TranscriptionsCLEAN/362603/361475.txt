  
 4.  the pleasant way in which I spent yesterday afternoon.  It is now Tea-Time & I am quite hungry again so as I've written 4 long letters this afternoon, I'll go to tea now & finish Dad's letter afterwards. Well, Mum, I must go now or the mob will have eaten all the butter & Jam. Best of wishes to all the neighbours & to Mrs Dobbo, Bunting & Stevens & Ali. From Your Own Boy Harry   XXX
