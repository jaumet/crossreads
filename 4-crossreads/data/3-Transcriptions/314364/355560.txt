<p>more native shops, where we bought some cigars very cheap. We went into a high   shop where they had some beautiful silk. I saw a couple of glorious silk dressing Jackets that I'd have liked to get for B.E. but the price was very much beyond me. I bought a couple of brass candlesticks, which was quite a novelty &amp; some Post cards. Also bought a couple of Lace collars for Lill.<br/>After visiting a few more shops we both got broke. Yank had a rupee (1/6) left, so we adjourned to the Y.M. &amp; [indecipherable] that in in two more feeds.<br/>We bought a couple of sticks &amp; then made our way to the wharf. We got aboard the Barges &amp; returned to the 'Lancashire' about &frac14; strength, after one of the most enjoyable days of my Life.<br/>Monday. March 3<br/>They finished coaling last night &amp; we are to sail soon after mid-day.   LeClere &amp; the Corp. went ashore this morning, but they had to be back by 11.20 &amp; they didn't have much time to see the City. Everything is smothered in coal dust. We left Colombo at 2 p.m. &amp; are now sailing merrily homeward. This is the second stage of our journey. In 10 days we should reach Freemantle, which is Home. Then about 10 days after that we hope to be in Sydney, which is just a glorious prospect. We heard in Colombo that Influenza was raging in Melbourne and that they had the [indecipherable]<br/>Building as a Hospital. It's to be hoped they soon get it in hand as it's a rotten thing to get about.</p>
