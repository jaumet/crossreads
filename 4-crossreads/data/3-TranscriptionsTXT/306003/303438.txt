Squadron came back to Qatia about 8 oclock tonight &amp; soon afterwards we started for Romani;  Major Chambers of the 2nd L.H. took his Squadron to Bir-Es-Sagia today &amp; could see no sign of the Turks, &amp; we decided to water their horses there, &amp; did not put on a guard.

As C Sqd was retiring tonight from Oghratina the Turks gave them two shots from an artillery gun, both shots fell short.  It was nearly midnight when we got back to Romani
