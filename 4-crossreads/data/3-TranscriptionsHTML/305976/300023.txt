<p>there was heavy Artillery fire during the night. We had been standing to since daybreak as a stunt was expected.<br/>Monday July 15<br/>Still shelling on both sides.<br/>The Division secured 500 prisoners principally Germans. The Germans with Turkish Troops attacked just after dawn. Two first Brigade outposts were captured. The fighting continued practically all day and the last posts were recaptured by counter attack. To give an example of how fond the Turks are of the Germans. On this occasion so prisoners tell us the Germans were to be used as storm troops backed up by the Turks. Everything went all</p>
