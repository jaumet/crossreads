Moascar Camp, near Ismailia, is even larger than that at Tel-el-Kebir. Seven aeroplanes were up flying over the camp. I passed trainloads of the Royal Horse Artillery en route for France. Our 1st & 2nd Divisions here are preparing for their departure to France. In Ismailia I passed General Birdwoo's house and, walking past the lake, I saw quite a number of warships including the monitors
