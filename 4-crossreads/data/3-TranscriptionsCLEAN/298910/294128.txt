  
 the only squad who hung on without relief, all the other Bearers said that we should get special credit. Probably between the 56th & the 55th on out right we have handled some 500 cases. The 56th were relieved on Monday night by 54th - but us Bearers had to keep pegging away. 5 Regimentals 56th & 3 Regimental Stretcher Bearers of the 54th were seriously wounded - not a one of us got a scratch - although we were in many tight corners, our first case we lifted was under very heavy fire & later while away our little shelter was knocked sideways & Adrian Feint's blanket torn to threads. Am writing this 9 pm, back at Buigny - what a relief - no sleep since Saturday night, not too much tucker - nothing hot for days - our feet were wet the whole time, if we had not came in we surely would have trench feet. We suffered Hell with the weather as we have had about six seasons, from blizzards & gales of 50 miles an hour - rain - hail - sleet - some of the wounded actually cried with the cold. It was almost beyond endurance. Surely Hell is no worse than France. War & its horrors. 
  Amen
