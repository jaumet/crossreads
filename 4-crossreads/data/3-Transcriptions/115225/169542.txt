<p>on the matter. anyway it is a very big shell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mar 22<sup><u>nd</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;The first drivers all went to Caestre where we took over Peerless lorries from 49<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;Tommy Division - we picked numbers out of a hat to see which lorry each man would have - I picked 8133 not a bad lorry but in bad condition &amp; out of adjustment &nbsp;We drove them back to our own Park &amp; fixed up the lockers &amp; beds etc like in the old lorries &amp; made it comfortable. lovely day - The 3<sup><u>rd</u></sup>&nbsp;&amp; 12<sup><u>th</u></sup>&nbsp;brigades also changed their lorries for Peerless at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mar 23<sup><u>rd</u></sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;We did&#39;nt go out to-day - we fixed up the lorry &amp; made several adjustments to engine etc. Joe is not sleeping on the lorry now, it is a great relief - two men are plenty on a lorry. Some of the lorries were in Bailleul to-day &nbsp;Fip - shifted the French post office &amp; nearly all Civilians have left- Fritz has done a lot of damage this week with his big gun &amp; to-day he got the clock tower of the Maire. The gun is supposed to be a 14.2 inch - We hear rumours that Fritz is making an advance on the Somme &amp; wiping us up -</p>
