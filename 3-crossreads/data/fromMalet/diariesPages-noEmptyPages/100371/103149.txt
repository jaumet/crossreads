The heather (purple) looked very pretty on the moors. We didn't see much of Southampton as we passed through. We entrained into a slow train for Weymouth where we arrived about 5PM, we passed through the town on the way to Hospital (the place is alive with Australians) in Motor Ambulances. We had tea had to parade at 7.45 PM. 
Tuesday 21st August, parade 6.45 AM then 8.30 we were classified as to what service we were capable of doing. I was classed C2 which means Australia possibly home service. I then had to go before the M.O. to have my board papers made out.
