177lost here. To be left behind meant that one would be left out in the open all night.
I set off in single file then. As I said it was pitch black and as usual a drizzling rain was falling.
We had to climb up small mounds and avoid shellholes before we finally reached our destination. Was fortunate enough to secure a good dugout when I reached the road, containing a nice warm fire. You may be sure I made myself very comfortable.
We stopped here about 4 days in all. Did practically no work, but just rested.
I had lost my razor in my pack when it was blown up by a shell. Harry Gray
