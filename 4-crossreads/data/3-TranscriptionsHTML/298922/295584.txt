<p>Sunday 30th September</p>
<p>We go direct to <strike>Taranto</strike>. I think the journey by rail is a pretty rough one &amp; a <strike>gang of International thieves go through your baggage. Some nurses recently lost everything &ndash; but that is a condition of active service one gets used to.</strike></p>
<p>Attended Church &amp; then made one of our Officers Submarine Guard as only a few men on board, the duty was too heavy for them. Temperature falling daily. <strike>Dear little Mother, if you were only coming to meet Dolly too, but some day soon I hope we will be back in N.S.W.</strike></p>
