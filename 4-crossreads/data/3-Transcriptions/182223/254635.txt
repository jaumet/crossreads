<p>Monday 8 February 1915<br />9 a.m.&nbsp;&ndash; The Pyramids as usual bathed in Sun. clouds often are overhead here, to an Australian portending rain, but the precious drops, never fall. The sands of the desert are filled with water worn stones from the size of a fist to the minutest particles. Large stones&nbsp;are white in colour &amp; not water worn. Must ask someone about them.&nbsp;<br />Climbed the pyramid&nbsp;this afternoon for the 2<sup>nd</sup> time. No difficulty. The sunset&nbsp;&nbsp;gorgeous from the top.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tuesday 9&nbsp;February 1915<br />Heavy clouds in the East breaking up from the North. In Australia one would say &ndash; Heavy rain within one hour.&nbsp;<br />Everything quiet in a surgical way.</p>
