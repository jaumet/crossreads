<p>Friday 26 May 1916<br/>Ordinary work.  Very cool day owing to head wind.</p>
<p>Saturday 27 May 1916<br/>Still in Red Sea.  Saw wonderful sunset.  Sun started to set looking like a balloon then got all knocked about and a black object showed up in middle of it;  looked like a ship, but dissapeared when sun set.  Suppose it is the atmosphere.</p>
