<p>France,<br/>1 September 1917.</p>
<p>Dear Father/.<br/>As is frequently the case, after being delayed for some time, the Australian Mail came in a bunch to-day, and I received four fetters from home, and several papers, including amongst the local ones two "Heralds" and two "Catholic Press".<br/> I am glad to hear you received the photos of our A,M.C. Detail alright although they don't do me justice. In reality I am much more robust than one would suppose from the print. I weighed myself on the meat scales at out Quarter Master's Store to-day and according to them I am eleven stone ten pounds. I can scarcely credit it myself but the butcher assures me that the scales are absolutely correct.<br/>So Cap is proving his worth as a sporting hound once more? It is truly marvellous how he manages to do any useful work with his handicap of superfluous avoirdupois. I thought he had degenerated into a lap dog by now and would never be of any further use with the gun. He must be an exceedingly well-bred animal to remain true to his instincts under the circumstances.<br/>I find it hard to visualise Tare now that he is taller than Kit. Whenever I think of him I still picture the squat burly figure, supporting a large red head and fat freckled face. Apparently he has lost all these adornments except the red head. I don't suppose he still retains the "sun-kisses". It makes me feel quite old to learn that he is a grown youth whose voice is breaking already. There is nothing brings home to one more the swift passage of time than to find the youngsters</p>
