Headquarters, 3rd Australian Division,
 
Lieut.Peters, M.C., is returning to his Battalion today, and I should like to express my great thanks to his Battalion and Brigade Commander and to yourself for having shared his services to us for so long.  He has worked extremely hard and with great keenness, and all our Raiding parties have benefited from his instruction.  It has been of the greatest help to us to have had an exper-ienced man who has been able to give us first-hand knowledge on the subject of Raids, and no better selection could have been made so far as we were concerned than that of Lieut.Peters.

Lieut.Charles Harold Peters:-   38th Battalion.
 
At ARMENTIERES on the night of 31st December and 1st January 1917, he led a Patrol against the enemy trench, having reconnoitred personally the line of advance on two previous nights.  On reaching the enemy's wire his party was dicovered by a search light and was attacked by machine guns and bombs.  With coolness and skill, he extricated his party.  He furnished at the conclus-ion of the Patrol's operations an excellent detailed reconnaissance report.  On the next night he led a relief party along the German wire to look for some missing men of another patrol.  After methodically searching NO-MAN'S-LAND in the vicinity, in spite of search lights and machine guns playing on the gap in the enemy wire, he discovered, and brought back to our lines, one of the missing men who had been wounded the night before, and was in a state of complete exhaustion.
