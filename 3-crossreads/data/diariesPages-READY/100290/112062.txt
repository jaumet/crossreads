Saturday
Rain as usual. The endless mud slush. Nothing special doing. Stand 1  hours in queue at carhon to get served with a few biscuits 2 letters from Bill Flo MacB. The lights of surrounding hills like a great city thousands encamped in the mud. Operations are greatly hampered. well nigh impossible to carry on.
