From the hill, one commands a magnificent view of the  Mediterranean  sea ever still & opalescent.  The "Triumph" & "Majestic" went down not far off.  Destroyers steal literally in & out the bay & the guns of  the  battleships, shore howitzers, & field batteries roar in concert.  Aeroplanes are active on reconaissance duty over the Turkish lines & I saw one pilot who ventured too low over the enemys fire.  The shell burst within some yds of the machine but did no damage.

Today they are a battered & torn regiment - they can muster about 200 whole men, & these are without stamina
