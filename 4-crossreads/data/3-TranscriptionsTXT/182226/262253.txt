 Thursday 19 August, 1915 
 Arrived at Lemnos at 5 a.m. French torpedo boat guard the entrances. The harbour is closed from sundown to sunrise. 
 All final instructions have been given we are held ready to move at an hours notice. We have had 200 rounds of ammunition issued, the pack I have to carry weighs over 100 pounds, just think of it. We have to land with this on a beach that is swept by shells from the Turkish. Have given up thinking of the future am&nbsp;living entirely in the present as no one knows what the next morning will bring forth. 
 Sailing has been postponed till tomorrow.
