with his writing, . -24th Xmas Eve - Oh, how I'm thinking of you all to-night & wishing I could just peep in and see you. Dorothy & I have been into Cairo & got a few cards & handkerchiefs to give to our friends in the a.m. There is a great amount of excitement at present - some of the wards are decorated with flags etc & the Red Cross people are giving the patients all kinds of goodies, so it will be a bit like a festive occasion. We had our Xmas Dinner to-night. Madame may (our caterer) gave us a great surprise, had the room decorated beautifully and a little present on each plate, (different kinds of Egyptian beads) and a most sumptuous dinner. I shall write next week and tell you about our doings
