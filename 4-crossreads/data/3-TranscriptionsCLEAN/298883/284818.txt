Contrary to expectations we suffered no casualties whatever during our approach to, and the crossing of the River though the enemy shelled fairly heavily.  We had an exciting run the through the main street of Peronne under Machine Gun fire.  It was during this period that we had our first casualties in the battalion during the action.  The 14th Brigade had cleared the town pretty well. Though most of the credit must go to the 54th Battalion of this brigade as they had the task of making the initial crossing of the River and marshes on the roughly constructed bridges and they did their job well.
