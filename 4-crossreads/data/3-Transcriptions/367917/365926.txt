<p>Sussex<br/>21.11.18</p>
<p>My dear Judge,<br/>I am now seizing an opportunity to answer your letter of Aug. 6 which reached me in the middle of a pretty busy time in France and which with a good many other letters has been knocking at the door of my conscience for some weeks past.</p>
<p>The gap between this and my last letter to you is a disgracefully long one and I regret it but it was due first of all to my disinclination towards writing earlier in the year when I was at home &amp; so much was going on in France, and secondly to the fact that from the time I rejoined the B.E.F. on Aug. 5 until the present time circumstances were all against writing as my poor regular letters home will show. Now however I am on leave and spending a few quiet days in the country and there is no excuse for further delay.</p>
<p>To reply to your letter. I have seen a couple of copies of the "Intelligences" and from them learnt something of the 'Varsity Reinforcement Company. The scheme seemed to meet with a fair amount of success in its initial stages, tho' now fortunately the reinforcements will not be required.</p>
<p>If only the authorities can see their way clear to a rapid returning and demobilisation of university undergraduates from the Australian forces there should also be no need for the educational scheme to which you referred. It seems to me not impossible that men could be got back in time to resume university work next March. I would be very glad if my young brother &amp; cousins could resume their medical work then.</p>
