  
 On reaching the town, we marched through the Govt. offices portion then down the main St. Adderley St where we were well received and back to the ship. It was a change to se the city as it was the suburbs which we had on Sunday & Monday been through & which struck me as being curious. There are in the city some very fine & modern looking buildings and the whole place seemed busier & more modern than what I originally thought. During the march which was rather hilly we felt, at times, rather tired but we did the about 12 miles all right & with sleeves rolled we must have looked well. 
 Wednesday 21st Left ship for march 10.15 and went to  common  "Common" by a different route past the Hospital and fort. We had 2 hours to ourselves there & indulged  to  in having the lunch we brought  to  together with soft drinks, bananas oranges & biscuits. Bought oranges to bring aboard ship and then we marched through the city & back to the ship about 4 p.m. We had a good reception through the city & after watching niggers coaling until about 5 pm we cast off and with the assistance of a tug cleared the wharves went out into the bay where the Medic & Demosthenes we awaiting us. The Warilda which had arrived early today soon followed. We all anchored in the Bay. 
 Thursday 22nd With Medic, Warilda Demosthenes & H.M.S. "Laconia" we cleared port about 8 am & with fine weather & a good swell said Good-bye to Cape Town & started Part II of our voyage.
