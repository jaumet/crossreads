<p>Thursday 8th August<br/>I commence this at St. Acheul Amiens the 8th of the series at a moment when we are in the midst of a successful offensive. Following on the Marne success, preparations were rapidly made here for a larger attack &amp; in a week from when its first signs were evident, it was launched. Large numbers of guns, tanks &amp; cavalry were brought up with great rapidity &amp; now we see the enemy taken completely by surprise &amp; being severely defeated. No official communiqu&eacute; have yet been published but we know that the number of prisoners &amp; guns captured is large. Slept well during the day &amp; at 5 P.M. found the wounded still coming in with a large percentage of German. The majority of these were left over until our own chaps were dealt with &amp; during the night we had a very busy time putting the huns through as well as new arrivals. All night long we were dealing with huns and only an occasional Aussie or Tommy.</p>
