 Monday 22nd April 1917 [1918] Busy day as regards silk underskirt &amp;, for me, it really is not too badly done. 10 a.m. C.O. visits me &amp; "well Sister how do you like your new room, nice &amp; quiet isn't it", are his comments, remarks as all do about my "negative" &amp; vanishes.  M.O. does not appear at all. Up for 3 hrs. &amp; very glad to be back in bed once more. 6 p.m. brings Sisters Leed, Peile &amp; Moreton with lovely flowers, &amp; my frock and kind enquiries from Matron (Mrs. Belcher), Miss Witherington, Home Sister &amp; Capt. Grant.
