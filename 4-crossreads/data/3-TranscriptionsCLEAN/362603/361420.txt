  
 6.  I had to fly to catch My Train to Bulford.  I had to duck up & down all sorts of underground passages to get my Train & only just did it.  I reached Salisbury & had to wait 3 Hours for a blessed Train.  I had no pass so I had to lie low, but had some Tea & had a nice snooze in the run to Bulford.  I had a glorious time.  I was made quite at Home & I was just as familiar with them all as if I had known them all my life.  Mrs Harbert shewed me many Photos with Mrs Rogers in them, taken when She was over here in 1911.  They are very much alike in looks & ways.
