We are having a rosy time of it here, do nothing all day but eat & sleep or read, there is a good stock of old magazines on hand. 
 Cookie is the only one who does any graft he busies him self at the cook house all day.  Porridge, bacon & eggs this morning, Meat & potatoes followed by preserved Pine apple & bread & jam for dinner & now we are wondering what is on the menu for tea  The trouble is that they will not leave us on this post  long, a week will just about see us out I think - Johno suggested that we should use ball ammunition if they come out to relieve us  Each of us put 15 p.t into a mess account & a nigger comes out with the stuff on a donkey every day from Ismalia.  It is fine to be away from the horses for a little while
