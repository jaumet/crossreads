<p>Northants War Hospital<br/>Duston<br/>Northants<br/>June. 20th</p>
<p>Dear Mother,<br/>About four days ago I received three Australian letters, two from home, one of them yours and one from Percy. They were dated about 18th &amp; 26th of March and were the first I have received since coming into hospital. I was very pleased to know that you were all quite well then, and hope that everyone is in a like condition now. I am glad to say that I am now getting on fine, I can now walk without crutches with the aid of a stick and apart from ankle trouble I never felt better in my life. Since coming across some six weeks or so ago the weather here has been splendid, it just reminds me of a nice Spring at home, every <strike>think</strike>thing is quite green and the sun is almost as hot as you would have it on a warm day in Australia. There is not much to vary the days here, we have a concert of sorts here almost every day, sometimes they are decent and sometimes otherwise, but they all help to pass away the long day</p>
