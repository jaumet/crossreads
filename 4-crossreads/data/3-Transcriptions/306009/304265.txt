<p>1915<br/>Mar. 20 Sat.<br/>I turned out in khaki short pants this morning &ndash; first in No. 2 General although there are plenty of them in other units &ndash; plenty of remarks from the chaps.<br/>A corporal &amp; 3 men left for Alexandria this morning to join Hospital Ship "Cecilia" &ndash; I don't expect they will ever rejoin the Unit.<br/>Motor ambulances kept busy transferring patients to Heliopolis.  We are only keeping as many patients as Mena House will hold &ndash; about 160.</p>
