  
 on the march, its wonderful what a small amount a man can live on when he is pushed Handed one of the two gas helmets in this morning, I suppose they are going to issue us with fresh one's  Nearly everyone has had their hair cut short I have dodged it so far. Went for a short route march this afternoon & the sun was very warm There is a small mail in & they are dishing it out. About 30 German prisoners went through here last night. I never saw them, but should like to have done so. 15th. Still at Allonville but I think we are moving this morning, B. Coy. were paid yesterday & I think we will be today. I wrote & posted 3 letters yesterday
