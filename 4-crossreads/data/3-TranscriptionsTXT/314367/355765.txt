lot of the men in the service -I can see how I could run the 'wine' successfully without leakage but I doubt very much if I could a mess - when you let your Steward ashore & he has to buy for the mess & puts it down in a 'market book' which he keeps & shows you now & again - I am told that 'pillage' exists in every single department of the Service & I am inclined to believe there is truth in the statement & that it is mainly a reaction against small pay to Warrant & Petty Officers & winked at by officers above them!!!!Well I've got my little lot in order - anyway - Time hangs - I am reading - "The Riddle of the Sands" is Rot with a large R - I cant stand it & have chucked it up - The style is execrable & the matter & conclusions drawn very questionable. We've lost Gordon & Lane - two good Bridge men - Only 1 of the 3 we've got can play & his game is weak - Every man on a ship shd cultivate his Bridge - It puts in time splendidly -
