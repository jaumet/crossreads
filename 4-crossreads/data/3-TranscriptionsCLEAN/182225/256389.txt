 SEPT.   WEDNESDAY 27   1916 
 Started to rain about mid-day & went on till evening. We got to Bulford about 10 AM and King George inspected us (the 3 rd  Division) & then we marched passed him & the 27 th  Battery was very good the best in the division they say. Anyway the officers were pleased with us & we were pleased with ourselves. King George has aged very much since I saw him four years ago in India. The rain spoilt the show from a spectacular point of view, but even so it must have been great. Got a letter from Linda in answer to my letters from England. Am so glad she seems to be getting strong again, & seems very happy. It makes all the difference in the world to know she is all right & happy.
