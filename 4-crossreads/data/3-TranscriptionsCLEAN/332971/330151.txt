  
 June 12th Words fail to describe the heat.  One of the saddest things on board has happened through it.  The death of Sargeant Major Norton which occurred in the small hours of the morning.  He was a royal Engineer & on his way to England to join the Military there.  He with his wife & 4 children boarded us at Colombo coming from Hong Kong. He was buried at 10am with Military honours.  The boat stopped for 1/4 of an hour.  The Captain read the burial service.  The Last Post was played.  And during the singing of The last verse of "Oh for a closer walk with God" the body was lowered.  It was draped with the flag of the Empire.  There is a subscription being raised for the Widow & Children & so far it has amounted to 170 . 
 Monday June 14th Parade again this am & still sweltering but the torture of being in our heavy uniform soon subsided or our indignation did when we learnt it was to bid farewell to two of our officers who were being sent back on account of their health.  Poor follows keen disappointment was written on their faces
