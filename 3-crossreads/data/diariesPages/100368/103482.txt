we would all get off the position safely. After we heard what was actually going to happen we were more at ease but candidly speaking I do not expect to get away.

Dec 15th Wed.
Still on the "qui vive" Bringing up large quantities of stores from the A.S. Depot and storing them inside the station grounds. Foodstuff of all descriptions are stored here. Small trestle bridge being built from the beach to the sunken ship "Milo". Issued with forty eight hours iron rations and ordered to keep our water bottles filled. We have also been issued with first field dressings and large quantities are in the tents in case of emergency.

Dec 16th Thurs.
A nose cap from a shell landed in B.R.S dugout. He had a narrow escape from injury. The shells seem to be getting more near every time, to our place of abode. The hits all but getting on to the piers and the barges. As I write this the shells are buzzing over our heads and bursting too near to be comfortable. Two members of our unit woke up this morning and found a shell case lying between them. Apparently the shell after having got rid of its shrapnel had dropped through the roof of their dugout whilst they were asleep
