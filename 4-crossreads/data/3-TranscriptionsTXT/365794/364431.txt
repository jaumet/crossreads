Wednesday 30th January 1918Rose (as usual on this trip) early & saw morning coming over Egypt & the grand old Nile.  Seeing Karnak in the moonlight I ask myself how often has she shone down just so for centuries & where are the thousands of beings gone who worshipped there in the long past ages?  Karnak 2 p.m. in garry, & photos taken, watched sunset from top of Pylon & bought scarab ring (1-14-0) just for association's sake.  9 a.m. went to Luxor temple & all dry caked earth on the ground where in the flood the Nile rises, grand carving & columns.  At night we, S. Hills, Corporal Richards & myself go again to Karnak & sit & think in the age long silence of the place.  Am now a pt. & have food etc. cut up, arm put in sling by C. Richards & all kindly help possible is given.
