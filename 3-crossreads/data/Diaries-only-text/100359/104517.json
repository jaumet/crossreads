February 1916.
Saturday Feb. 26th
Letter from Lill. Plenty of canteens around wet and dry. Plenty of gambling too. Issued with Tobacco again; also Bread, best bread we ever had. Iron rations for Dinner and Breakfast, and hot meat for tea. We repitched all the tents in a square, and put all our stoves in the centre, also pitched 4 Tortoise Tents. Roll call at mid-day and half the crowd missing. Wrighty and Billsy and I walked around the canteens in the evening, plenty of beer flying, small parties of men with candles lying about every where gambling. Looked through curiosity shop, but must wait until pay day to make any purchases. "Bluey" Stanton and Bedville played up and were put in the Guard Tent. Peter H. left a note to say he?d call again tomorrow. While spotting around we came across "Rass. asleep among the Big Guns. We assisted him back to camp and at intervals Whyte Doherty arrived, collapsed in a heap, and went to sleep.
Sunday 27th.
First parade 7 a.m. Church Parade 9.30 very poor attendance. Big crowd of defaulters up for A.W. L. Bedville got 28 days, Bluey 7 days and so on. Lucky "Doby" got off with only 1 day. Had Plum pudding for dinner. Peter H. and Harry Maughn came to see me both looking very well. Harry was at Anzac for 3 months, and Peter is in the 30th Battalion. Went for a walk and had a yarn which I very much enjoyed. Had a look around the cemetery where the men are buried who fell at Tel-el-Kebir in 1882. It is a very pretty little spot and is well cared for. Just behind it is another piece of ground where the men of the A.I.F. are buried. A pathetic feature about the old Cemetery, is that a number of the wooden crosses bear the inscription "UNKNOWN". We saw two English ladies in the cemetery. They were quite a treat for sore eyes, as the only ladies we have seen since leaving Melbourne were the ones who passed in Boats on the Canal.
