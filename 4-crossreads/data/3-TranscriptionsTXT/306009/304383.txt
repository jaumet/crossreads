 1915 July 16 Fri. Nearly all the special duty contingent selected but  not  the Clerk. There are 8 candidates for the job:- 1 St. Sgt., 1 Sgt., 1 L.Cpl &amp; 5 ptes. Competition is very keen.  Later:  Competition is still keener &ndash; there are now only 1 Sgt. 1 L.Cpl &amp; myself in the running.  Latest:  Defeat! The lucky man is the Lance Corporal. Attended Scout meeting &ndash; the boys played games some of which were terrifically funny &ndash; I don't think I have laughed harder since I've been in Egypt.
