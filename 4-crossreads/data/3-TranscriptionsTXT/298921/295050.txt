March, 1915Thursday 18Beautiful mornings now, but the Dust & sand is desperate, Had a long day out by Moses Well, (where he used to camp) about 3000 mounted men doing quick work. You should read W.N. Willis Book on Egypt, I think it is called, Before Christ came to Egypt - one can realize many things in the Testament now, such as stoning a man to death - the Desert is all small stones just the size to throw well & the prickly thorn bush, with which they crowned the Saviour grows in the sandy patches.
