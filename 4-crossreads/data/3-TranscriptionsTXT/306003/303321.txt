 16-4-16 Sun 16th Had a Tommy Sig. Officer out today having a look around A rumor that we are going to Aldershot shortly was brought out from Cairo yesterday but it did not get much of a hearing;  We asked Abdul Moolah to come at 8 oclock tonight to make tea for us &amp; he turned up to time &amp; kept tea up to us while we played cards;  The well sinkers finished at 8 oclock this morning &amp; went on to Ezbet-Soo-Doon where they have another one to sink for the troops there. 
 The water is very black &amp; dirty today &amp; it will not be fit to drink for a couple of days;  Cameron has a touch of Nile fever, Trickett &amp; also several other lads have had it &amp; by all accounts it is rather unpleasant
