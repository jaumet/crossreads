<p>23rd Thurs.  We are catching it now. The time is getting close for some of us to be sent to enquire about Fritz.  We have been about all day like a lot of "Ghouls"  Gas masks over our heads to get used to them.  1st hour I felt inclined to Vomit.  Yet use is next to nature.  We lived it out.  But were glad to take them off.  Reverse's are coming in From France and work is going hard.  They are putting it on now in the Moonlight.</p>
<p>24 Friday  We go through a prepared Room that is Gassed, a few got a small dose of it through Faulty Masks and also thro' neglect in fixing them on.  The Weather is Dry now and the ground is Frozen hard  But it is nothing to see a man shoot out equipment &amp; all on a lump of ice.  In Parts it is like a skating Rink.</p>
<p>25 Saturday  Per. Special Invitation of Lady Wilton (Dowager) her Palace at Wilton was Thrown open for us to look over.  It is very Beautiful, and the Heirloom's &amp;  Armour's Weapon's From the Old Tudor Period were many and very interesting.  But how we were watched.  They still think we are Convict's<br/>Their Ignorance of us is Woeful.  We Finished the night by an entertainment given to us by Mrs Lena Ashwell was good.</p>
<p>26  Sun.  Any one who had cash or chose was allowed to stay in Wilton Last night and have Sunday any where   Salisbury out of Bounds   So no Church for Your's Truly a good Lay in instead and actually Breakfast in Bed, Got up at 11 a.m. I met Sir William Rawlence going home to Bulbridge Park after Church and he was good enough to invite me.  He seemed to take a Great interest in Aus' &amp; our Framing &amp; stock raising System's.  But I astounded him when I told him Sydney Kidman owned or held 1,000,000 square miles of Territory for stock Breeding.  Tall but true. [actually nearer 100,000]  His is a Lovely place.  But his "Dog's Cemetry" took my eye.  Memory of FIDO Faithful to the Last Etc over about a dozen of them.  I enjoyed his Poultry for Dinner and also his afternoon trip in the Car.</p>
<p>27 Monday.  Our Surmise is correct.  The first 25 From our ReInforcement is picked and go on Wednesday.  They are Given 24 hour's Leave and then get special equipment and go to France.  We are kept hard at it and our turn is not so far away.</p>
<p>28 Tues  Same old hard graft.</p>
<p>29 Wed.  Leap Year  Y.M.C.A girl proposed to me.  I bought her a box of chocolate's instead  She scored about 30 I hear</p>
<p>1st March Thursday  Too wet for Parades  Lecture's  all day.  V.D. Lecture in afternoon by Drs &amp; Clergy.</p>
<p>2nd  Friday  am sent to Burford V.D. Hospital as guard  Heaven's it's awful to see the poor wretches sufferings  Officers, Clergy are inmates  I'll be glad when my week expires.  The N.Z. Artillery are 1 mile away at Park House.  As many Planes here as Bars, a very large Avo' school</p>
