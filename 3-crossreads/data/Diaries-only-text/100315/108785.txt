with ration parties, parties carrying wire c things were rather mixed. Our guns very active and heavy shells were going high overhead and landing well in rear of Fritz's line. Little flashing sparks high up in the distance showed where shrapnel was bursting. Very wroth with our batmen who failed to turn out a cup of tea for us and duly strafed them. Parties carrying wire up to the front line to be put up in front of the Outposts. Machine guns on our front except for an occasional flick were quiet.
