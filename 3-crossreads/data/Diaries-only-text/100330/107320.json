As nothing happened worthy of note between the 31/5/17 to the 6/6/17 I skip over these periods. It was a very hot muggy day on Wednesday 6/6/17 Thunder could be heard a long way off but gradually it came closer until about 5.45 Pm when the Thunder Lightning over head was very strong Rain began to fall at this time a general down pour lasted until for over an hour the water rushed around the Tents in some cases it overflowed into the Tents, all hands kept to their tents passed the time away singing. Although trenches of 6" had been dug around each tent they soon overflowed the water under our flooring gradually arose until it was level with the Boards but did not overflow. The Lightning was very vivid was dancing about in all directions, as soon as the storm passed off the water soon was clear of the Camp the Lads walking about soon stirred up the mud the place was in a terrible condition. As there were no wind no damage was done to the Camp. Having the position of Corporal
