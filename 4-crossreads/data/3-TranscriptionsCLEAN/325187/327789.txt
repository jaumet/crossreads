  
 [13 February 1916] 
 1.30 A.M. "SAMALUT" We got a surprise start yesterday morning at  5 A.M. orders came that the Natives had been firing on the Train from  LUXOR  so the whole Brigade was ordered to entrain by midday.  Here we are now  South  of Cairo instead of going North to Mersa Matrue on the Mediteranean  I am glad as the Coast air never agrees with me X  The Powers that be never seem to learn much  X  We are carting about great wooden Troughs for Watering the Horses, not collapsible with bands as we use in Australia at the Wells- Then the Head Ropes are always eaten by the Horses- We know that Tarring saves them yet cannot get it for love or money.  "Here endeth the growl."
