  
 wind and we have got something of a roll on. 23rd April Monday 1917 At Sea Since leaving Fremantle a couple of days ago we have not seen any land nor any shipping we have I believe had a course appointed by the Admiralty which has been much further south than the ordinary track of traffic. The "Doris" has gone she left us the first night leaving Fremantle we have had some very heavy swells and at times the ship has done some terrific rolls The spirits of all on board are gradually going up by leaps and bounds. We expect to reach Melbourne on Wednesday morning The weather has been very cold for the past couple of days and we have been a good deal in the blankets just to keep in out of the cold. The journey is now nearly completed it has been a long and tedious and anxious one and we will be glad to get it over especially those men suffering with nerves.
