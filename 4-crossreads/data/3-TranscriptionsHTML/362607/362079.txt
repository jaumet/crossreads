<p>Dear George,<br/>This is a general View of Havre. You can see that it is a pretty big place. It looks all right in a  Picture. I can't tell you very much about the place yet we only get on half day a week &amp;  every night from 6 to 10 pm. It is dark at 4.30 too. It is a lovely place in the summer time when sea bathing is all the go. This place is very hot in summer &amp; very cold in winter. Best wishes to you all  Harry</p>
