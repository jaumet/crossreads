6/9/15 Johnstons Jolly
of the 6th Bn. The HQ is a little semi-dugout semi lean to and from it I have a wonderful view over the dancing Agean Sea blue in the sun and a dream island called Samothrace and another called Imbros lying lying jewels out among the white prancing seas. In the foreground are store ships and others lying at anchor but they keep out of gun range. Looking down ? a large gully sandy, steep on both sides with scattered scrub. At 2 pm went through trenches with Lieut Guilfoyle. Looking through periscope there was nothing to be seen but a confused mass of tumbled earth and sandbags ? the Turkish trenches about 250 yards in front. Absolutely no one or no thing in sight and yet we know they are there right enough.
