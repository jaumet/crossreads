All went till 3.30AM when just at daybreak I was half asleep I heard a familiar and uncanny swish.
I did not have to wait long to ascertain the cause of this noise as it was followed immediately by the report of a 5.9 shell exploding right in the yard of our billit
Both of us were somewhat surprised and certainly wide awake so at once made for the door only to be knocked back by the thick fumes of shell chemicals.
Coming to the conclusion
