<p>We are to be kept here untill there is room for us in an Australian Hospital.</p>
<p>Mon. 26th Aug.<br/>Left Brighton this morning and arrived in London about 11.30am. As we have to change stations, we were taken from one to the other in our own Ambulances. We had an hour to wait for a tram, so had a walk over to a Church hut, where we had a Blowout.</p>
<p>Left London about 12.30pm and while travelling in the train, I began to feel jolly funny. Arrived Harefield about 2pm. and as soon as the Sister saw me, she shoved me straight into bed, and sent for the Quack. Said it was French Fever.  (In ward 2. 1st A.A.H.)</p>
<p>Wed. 28th Aug.<br/>Felt a lot better, so was allowed up.<br/>Had X Ray on my arm again.</p>
