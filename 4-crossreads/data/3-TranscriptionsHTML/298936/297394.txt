<p>roughest problems &amp; have required the greatest tack. Hunter is so obviously lazy that I had to use very plain language but of cause he attempted abuse.</p>
<p>That however on the [indecipherable] was drained out of him, &amp; he has very little to say.</p>
<p>He appears to be coming round now, but I am [indecipherable] with him.</p>
