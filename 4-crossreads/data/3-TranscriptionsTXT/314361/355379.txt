If we could get the same pair back it would be OK. Every man has to change his socks once a day.We are having a very quiet time since we arrived back in trenches, though I can hear heavy bombardments on each side of us. There is a lot of rumours about of us making a shift away from this sector all together & also of more raids & stunts impending.I am well off for clothes just now, have had a new issue & have managed to secure two pairs of trousers slacks & [cycling?]Received letter from Matt.Received another photo from Lou the other day, she is looking fine, the real lady that she is.Friday 13 th 16There was a raid last night made by the 54th As usual we had a terrible bombardment. The din was awfull, & flashes of light like lightning everywhere & streams of bullets whizing through the air. Do not know how they got on, as good as we did I hope. I believe that we are leaving today for some unknown destiny, the Somme eventually I believe.
