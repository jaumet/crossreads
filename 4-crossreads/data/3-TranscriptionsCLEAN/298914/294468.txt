  
 Deiran 15/2/18 Pack up and leave camp with HQ men and proceed to Latron. 16th Leave 7 am and proceed.  Wagon nearly lost near Motza through break giving way.  Arrive Jerus 5 pm and meet Kenny & [indecipherable].  Arrive Bethlehem 6 PM and camp in an old Greek Monastry. 17th Windy dirty Day 18th Pack up ready to move out. 19th Leave Bethlehem 10 am with pack animals and have a very rough trip through the narrow streets.  Crowds of people line the way.  Wind up and down the bridle path and eventually get a glimpse of Jerusalem over all the rough country.  Awful rocky country having to lead the animals most of the way.  Have lunch 3 PM in a little grassy patch & move on and at dark camp up on the hill overlooking the Dead Sea. 20th 3 am move on again in rain and wind up and down, reaching the flats near a big redoubt which is being shelled heavily.  Spread out and get across as quickly as possible.  Hide under cover of the redoubt all day and get the wind up over a few close shots.  Erect station at dark and do some traffic.  Men set out
