After this was over Mr. Duke took me round to one of his friends place Mr. Shelley, the Town Clerk & we had a yarn there for a couple of hours & then we went for a stroll round the promenade & then back to dinner & more arguments.  We get on remarkably well the old chap & I, & talk over all sorts of subjects.  He is one of the finest men that I could ever wish to meet & before leaving him this afternoon he insisted on me taking 10 to help me on my way & he said I was not to trouble about paying it back any time would do.  He offered to lend me any sum but I would not hear of it, its alright having a friend like this over here for you never know when you might be pushed for money.  Before leaving I gave Miss Sparks a pair of my field glasses & she was delighted with them.  Its not much for all the kindness they have shown me while in England.
