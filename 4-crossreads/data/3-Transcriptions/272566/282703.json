<p>Tuesday 13 November</p>
<p>Fine Day but the roads were greasy.<br/>Run to the new Tommy Ambce. that has taken over Waratah Camp, the 49th.<br/>After dinner I went to Bailleul by the same route as yesterday and returned by the same road.<br/>Today a terrific bombardment opened up &ndash; quite the worst I ever remember.<br/>After tea a party of us went to a splendid Pierrot Show given by the 4th Canadian Div. under the name of "The Maple Leaves".  It even beats "The Duds".  The chap who dresses as a girl takes the part admirably, in voice, actions and dress.  He makes a very pretty &amp; attractive Girl.  I will never forget this show.  The band too, was A1.  A number of nurses were present.<br/>The remainder of our unit go tomorrow.</p>
