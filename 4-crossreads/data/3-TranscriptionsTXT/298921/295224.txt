 September, 1915 Friday 10 Lovely weather now &amp; cool nights, am posting you some snapshots of Anzac today.  Heard today that the Transport carrying some of the 6th Brigade has been torpedoed &ndash;  Col: Linton  Brigadier &amp; about 20 others drowned &ndash; Jack Lorimer &amp; Harry Phillips are in that Brigade, but hope were not among the 20. It surprises me that more transports are not sunk considering the shipping between Alexandria &amp; Gallipoli .
