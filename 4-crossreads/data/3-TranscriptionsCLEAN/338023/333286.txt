  
 home called while I was in London. He did not get close as it was another case of 'tip & run', but he made a bad blunder when he took the Paris track. This is a most unhealthy place for Zepo. There's a Bttle Plane per square mile in the Clouds and a million or so on the ground ready to fly when there's room in the air. You get used to their row after a while but it beats Sydney's trams. Rumor says it is scaring all the birds out of the country. You see very few certainly. 
 So far no parcels have turned up, or papers. It's useless sending things, few of us get anything but registered stuff & even that fails sometimes. Just got several old letters from Betty & one from Mother - all Hospital, also one from M. 23rd Jan - so that's not too bad. Believe Ferg. started a rumor that I went away & got sent back ....crook. Heard it from a Randwick chap. I'll stir the blighter up if I ever get the [?]
