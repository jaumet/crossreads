 Parody . Do they want us 
 to Lose the War. 
 &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; 
 The 4  th   command depot 
 is one of the best 
 Where war weary soldiers 
 get a much needed rest 
 And plump Canteen Corporals 
 all hearty &amp; hale 
 Laugh &amp; grow fat while 
 they guzzle brown Ale 
 Chorus 
 Do they want us to lose the War 
 To spread the sad tidings 
 to Camps near and far 
 Up soldiers together give 
 one hearty cheer 
 Shout death to the traitors 
 who water our beer
