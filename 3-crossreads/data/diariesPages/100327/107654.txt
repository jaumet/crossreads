Was awakened in middle of night by orderly with despatch ? merely a bunch of correspondence of trivial matters from Brigade. Cursed. Moonlight at stand to. Suffering from dysentery so had neither swim nor breakfast. Back to bed and case of self inflicted wound reported. Went down to dressing station found one of our reinforcements had developed cold feet and put a bullet through his body ? not serious but plenty of blood Had Court of Inquiry assembled inside 5 minutes and his evidence taken. Stopped evacuation from peninsular and warned Provosts staff Hope to get this man sentenced to good stiff term by Court Martial "pour encourager les autres"
Stick bomb cleared hill and burst down slope a good shot right from enemy's trenches. Padre down ? it must be Sunday Mass proceeding on parade ground. When time hangs heavy I smoke an occasional cigarette, am almost an "habitual" smoker. Enemy sniping very slack but plenty of rattles with machine guns. 
About 1130 a thick fog came up from the sea suddenly and turned a sunny day into a raw cold one. One could see it coming blotting out everything as it advanced. Doubled our posts in firing line. Sending away dead men's kits. Letter from Buckley written from Valletta just prior to departing for England, Says he feels funny in head. Derrick died two days out. Man who was buried by "Asiatic Annie's" shell escaped from hospital and was wandering round the firing line. Mental balance evidently disturbed
Kennedy (rheumatism) invalided to England. During afternoon picked up some machine gun work from Stewart, in order to be able to work a gun myself as a last hope. Andrew up ? beach party to be changed tomorrow. Arranged details. Ordered to proceed to Imbros tomorrow for Canteen stores. Shelling started after tea
