When we entrenched at Suvla I was made responsible for the up keep of the trenches, burial of bodies of which there were a good many, cutting of communication saps &c. Of course if there was any scrapping going on I took charge of my platoon.
When the 18th Battalion came on the scene we went into reserve, & I was made their bomb-throwing instructor, I only gave them one lesson, as I was bowled over the same day.
My people are in Paris, so I am going to run over there as soon as I am well enough.
After that, I will be sent back to Australia, as I won't be myself for some considerable time.
A Balmain boy young Lown, son of a Darling St (No 200) grocer, was knocked over in May. I wrote to his people as he was a friend of mine, & I believe they published my letter.  He is the only Balmain-ite I know
[Private Mervyn Allen Lown, No 193, 13th Battalion]
