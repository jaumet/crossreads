 I have had two more letters from Rita of Feb &amp; June &amp; she is as staunch &amp;hopeful as ever. In reply I sent last night I have re-iterated my desire for her to come over &amp; marry me. No reply in connection with Corresp Schools. Work is increasing &amp; I always go to bed tired out, these days. Have made about 6/- from photos this week.
