  
 June, 1915 Scyce natives Paid the Scyces as usual today their womenfolk are more like "Crows" than anything else, heads & shoulders covered with long black shawl. All the men issued with new boots & I am having them sprigged in anticipation of going to the Dardanelles. Doley Wilshire came into my Tent last night, he looks Brown & fit, I told him to keep an eye open for Harry Mulligan but if no Battalion given it is almost impossible to find anyone.
