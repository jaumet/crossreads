  
 11.4.16 it in a very cool spot; A native put in an appearance yesterday & this morning selling beer just outside the mud wall we are camped in, & refused to take the hint to make himself scarce, so we rang up an Egyptian Officer at Bent-Samarag at dinner time to have him moved & 
 an Egyptian guard appeared on the scene in a remarkably short time & reported for duty, he is the hardest looking "doer" I have seen for some time dressed the same as all the low class of Egyptian only his dresses were more ragged than the average & an old rifle swinging on his shoulder & a worn out bandolier on made him look rather comic, but the beer seller did not seem to appreciate his looks & he made himself before the guard got within coo-ee of him
