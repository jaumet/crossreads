<p>Tuesday Dec 11<br/>Taubes came over today observing &amp; we saw a very fine air duel unfortunately no machines were brought down.<br/>Wednesday Dec 12<br/>Taubes raided Ramley to day. Ramley with its tall spire &amp; tower of the forty martyrs looks beautiful<br/>Must visit Ramley at first opportunity. Rechon is a quiet country village. Its principal products seem to be the wine industry, nuts &amp; oranges.<br/>Some of the Orange groves are irrigated to perfection. One being camped here could easily forget that there was any War. The occasional visits of the Taubes however keep us</p>
