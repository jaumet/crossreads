an upturned Allied Aeroplane, how it got there no one can say. All around the dump huge holes had been made by the bombs that were dropped. Luckily a great many had dropped into the fields and had down no damage.
The tall trees which bordered the side of the road at this part were all stripted and torn of their branches.
All over the cultivated fields were huge shells in their hundreds. In one field which had been harrowed, there were hundreds of shells which had been thrown by the explosion into all manner of positions  One could not help smiling at the manner of them all  They were just like an old cemetery with all the headstones lying at all angles.
This dump occupied a space of about two miles. Luckily only part of it had been distroyed. The part that had been distroyed was nothing but a huge mass of burning or burnt up material, ammunition of all descriptions had been destroyed. The continued explosion of one part of the dump had made a hole in the earth, thirty feet deep and fifty or sixty feet in diameter. It is said that fifty seven lives had been lost at this disaster.
On our way we saw a motor amb. standing on the roadway.
