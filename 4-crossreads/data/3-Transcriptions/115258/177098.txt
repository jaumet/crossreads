See them slowly dragging their sulking camels along, laden with water or ammunition under shell fire or see the ambulance-man bringing up his &#39;cacolets&#39; for the wounded whilst a Turkish sniper is pinging away at him all the time. Then you wonder still more. There is nothing exciting about leading a camel. None of the thril in it that a cavalry man feels in a charge, but it is true courage. I think the Gyppos show when , under hot fire, and over places devoid of cover, they quietly led their camels along at the snail&#39;s pace of about two miles an hour.</p>
