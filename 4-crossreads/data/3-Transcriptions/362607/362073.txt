<p>Dear Dad,<br/>This is the place that I visited on my last leave to London. It is a great place but a lot of the best things are put away for safety. The Lions on the right grace the Pedestal of Nelson's Monument. I had to meet Cyril here once, I am going to the Island again on Thursday alone. Ellis will not make the trip as it is such a long way but I want to go again before I get to France. I want to see Scotland next time. We are having fair weather with an occasional cold night. There is no news to give you, Dad, except that we are both well likewise Dick &amp; Ernie Thomas. The latter is away at Blackpool on leave at present. Best wishes to all &amp; Love from Harry</p>
