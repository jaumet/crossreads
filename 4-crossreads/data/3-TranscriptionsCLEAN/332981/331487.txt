  
 The engine & tender ready for service weighing 127 tons. My work was away at the ballast pit, with a rake of trucks which had to be loaded up by the Marion Steam Shovel. The train cosisted of 30 open trucks & after they were shunted up along side of the shovel, by a signal the trucks were drawn down as the shovel filled them, every shovel full of ballast weighed 1 ton & a truck was loaded in less than two minutes. 
 This Marion Steam Shovel is a wonderful invention, one man controls the movement of the shovel into the ballast & one man swings the apparatus around & unloads the ballast into the trucks & another man attends to the firing & keeping up the supply [of] water in the boiler. The whole lot of trucks were loaded up in less than one hour & then drawn away & taken down into the shunting yard to go away on the Nord line somewhere, then another lot of trucks were taken around & also loaded up & in due course were also dispatched on the Nord line.
