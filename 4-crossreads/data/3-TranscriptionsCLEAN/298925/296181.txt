ext. "Prof Beauty"
Thinkest thou there are no serpents in the worldBut those that glide along the grassy sodAnd sting the luckless foot that presses them?There are those in the path of social lifeDo bask their spotted skins in fortune's sunAnd slay the soul.
I see thou has't pass'd sentence on my heartAnd I'll no longer weep nor plead against itBut with the humblest most obedient patienceMeet thy dear hands, and kiss them when they wound me.
