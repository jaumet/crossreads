<p>not permit of our resting (I was going to say sleeping) in any other position. Only one could enter or depart at a time. The &quot;room&quot; was about six feet long, including the width of the entrance &quot;hall&quot;, through which the bitter wind and frozen atmosphere found it&#39;s way much to our discomforture. There being no room to turn round, our only mode of exit was to riggle ourselves out feet first. This &quot;room&quot; was also our eating house, one would crawl in with his food and the other would pass his as far&nbsp;as possible, the one inside taking it from him, when sufficiently near, and then would rest on an elbow, facing each other, wirh our backs pressed against the muddy walls and enjoy our banquet.

Many of our 18 pounders were&nbsp;here, and how Fritz used to shell it, all day and night he gave the gunners no rest, and yet he never succeeded in quietening those splendid guns. The more &quot;he&quot; shelled, the oftener they &quot;barked&quot;. A very &quot;hot&quot; place Flers was.</p>
