<p>23/4/18<br/>Stewart came up tonight from the Transport &amp; Sutherland is returning.  While we were having tea word came of Bubbsie McCartin's M.C.  A good boy and an old original.  Brought up R.S.M. Porter to replace Cadwell for a few days.  There was a fair lot of shelling round the place and much heavy stuff going overhead.  Rations arrived and their distribution was not too satisfactory.  Our chaps had some shots at the Huns coming out to their posts.  They could also be heard talking &amp;c.</p>
