  
 The next night I took on Runner from platoon H.Q. to Company HQ at Millers Daughter Dugouts about 1/2 miles from the Line, but the night was very quiet except when a stray Machine Gun would open out 3 or 4 shots & then close up again. 
 The third night in I was put on patrol across 200 yds of open space that Devided D Coy from C Coy. This was no sweet Job as every now and then Fritz would send over Star Shells & Flares, that lit up the country for miles & the only thing to do was stand as still as possible with your head bent, so the light would not light up your face there were only 2 of us on this & we carried Rifle with the Bayonet sticking in the Sling swivels so we could fix it at a seconds notice, & 2 mills Grenades in our pockets ready for a dust up. 
 Everything is as silent as death except our own footsteps in the soft snow
