 The veri idea of the " Hun " or anyon dare to "play up " in a countri like this seem almost a sacrileg . We have all heard a lot about Franc , but it is far more beauti than ani of us ever dream . There were 8 of us in each carriag . Oru crowd consist of MacDougal , Payney , Frank Wood , Aldis , " Mile " Sheehaw , Bert Hunt , Stan Wright , and Myself . The carriag were not too good , but far more comfort than the stink box we rode in , in Egypt . We look out of the window as long as we could . It did not get dark till about 10 then we unrol our blanket and tri to sleep , but veri few of us had much sleep; as the floor was too jolli hard . Saturday 24th We were all awak about 5 , when we tri to get a wash in our mess tin , it freshen us up , anyhow . Then we chew some bulli beef and biscuit and said we ?d had breakfast . Then we continu to feast our eye on the glorious countri through which we were steam . At interv of a few hundr yard the French soldier are post , guard the Railway , also on all the Bridg and cross . They all seem to be men about 40 50 Their uniform of blue and grey and some wear scarlet pant , look veri quaint to us , after be use to noth but Khaki . We greet them all with hearti cheer , and threw them cigarett and tobacco of which we had a good suppli . When we pull up at a station the kid all rush up and beg for " souvenir " badg off our hat or coat , or coin and they seem quit delight even with a tin of corn beef . It is hard to realis that this countri is at war , as all the peopl look so happi and content but we ca n't help notic the absenc of men and the number of peopl in mourn .
