<p>Tues. Jan 15<br/>Rain, snow and Frost all mixed up. The roads are in an awful mess. On Sunday we moved from No 10 to No 7 Camp. It is much better here as we have our meals in the Hut and don't have to crowd into a Mess Hut. Yesterday we were issued with our gear. A load big enough for a Pack mule. I've got a rotten cold. Really ought to write some Letters, but can't settle down to it.</p>
<p>Wed. 16<br/>More Route marching. On parade they called out for some men to work at H.Q; so I hopped out for one, as I'm sick of paddling about in the slush. I reported at 5.30 and was put on as Waiter in the Mess. Plenty of good tucker and it's <u.dry</u>.</p>
<p>Thur. Jan 17.   <u>FRANCIS' Birthday</u></p>
<p>Weather rotten, snow, hail and wind. Doing pretty good at Headquarters. The only draw back is that one has to work so late. They have a formal dinner every Thursday night and it keeps us busy. Wrote to France.</p>
<p>Fri. 18<br/>Got a letter from France today. She seems to like Egypt alright. There is a lot of talk going round the Camp about us going to Egypt, but I don't think there's anything in it.</p>
<p>Sat. 19. <br/>I have been sleeping in 8 Hut, No 7 Camp, but it is a fair distance away from H.Q., and is a nuisance if one wants a wash or brush up, so I spoke to the Corp. about it, and today I moved my things up to the Fire Station which is quite near. At night I went to the Canteen and won 6/- playing House.</p>
