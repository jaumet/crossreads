  10th August, 1916.  
 From Albert the road to the firing line leads over the hill at the 
 back of the town and thence through Becourt Wood on the outskirts 
 of which are the old British front line trenches - the trenches 
 held by us prior to the commencement of the attack on 1st. July. 
 Becourt Wood has not seen any fighting to speak of, with the 
 exception of the few shells which come over every day searching for 
 gun positions, horse lines etc., and is therefore recognisable as a 
 wood, which cannot be said of some of the more famous Woods.  From 
 now on we are on terrain captured from the Germans during the 
 present offensive.  The first thing of interest is perhaps the 
 German front line system.  Despite the seven days bombardment of 
 this system which preceeded our attack, the trenches, and more 
 particularly the dugouts, are in a very fair state of preservation. 
 The ample dugouts are quite capable of holding all the men the 
 Germans would be likely to have maning the front line system and 
 how difficult it is to root them out has been told again and again. 
 I climbed down into one of the dugouts and despite all I had heard 
 of their strength and roominess, they were a surprise and revelaton 
 to me.  The entrance was from the bottom of the trench (which would 
 be 9 or 10 feet below the top of the parapet) down a flight of 
 about 15 steep steps.  You were then in a chamber in which you could 
 stand up and as you were probably them from 25 to 30 feet below the 
 top of the parapet, it was easy to realise how safe it would be there 
 against the most furious bombardment.  The roof and sides were 
 stayed up with heavy timber such as is used in a coal mine and one 
 chamber leads into another forming a series which could shelter 
 probably 200 men.  Other exits are provided so as to facilitate the
