Arab-made stretcher made of palm leaves and cost 15 piastres. By the way we were paid today and with our pay we were issued with Indian rupees.
8.30 pm. Just been haul'd out - 4 nosebags missing out of the eight which were put behind the horses this evening. Had a "wordy" 5 minutes with the Sergeant of the Pick picquet. No wonder all my horses were not fed up at 8 oclock when some of the bags were "pinched" Going away on trek tomorrow some of them are short on nosebags. Very obvious!Now for bed.
