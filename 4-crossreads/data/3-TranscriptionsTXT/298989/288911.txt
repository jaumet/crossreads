Anzac20/12/15The men kept sniping up till the last moment and then in batches quietly slipped away along soil covered communication trenches to ledge at back and then with blanket padded feet and loaded with packs and gear crept silently away through the deep gullies, looking in the moonlight like gliding shadows. My job consisted in seeing all these various parties off and then reporting their having left to H.Q. Bde. H.Q. shifted at 2200 to Reinforcement camp and after that we were blocked right through on a line to the O.C. Rear Guard on Plugge's Plateau; where, in case of accidents a force remained heavily garrisoned with machine guns.
After the last big party left and only our 60 were left we shifted Batt.H.Q. up to Pedlers dugout and I took a turn at patrol duty in the fire trench, walking along and telling all my party (C2) our plan of action and all were quite prepared to fight our way out and we had bombs in our pockets for unforeseen occurences. Furnished beforehand nearly every man with a watch, calling them in from others to do so and set them at Divisional time checked through the signallers. This time checking was quite a feature of the whole evacuation and as parting times came officers were conferring watch in hand and checking the mens watches. Sergt Craner was of great assistance to me checking off the men's times and finding the way about.
