<p>Men in the Engine rooms say they could hear the "plop plop" of the shells as they fell into the water.  Our superior speed enabled us to dodge her range finding and confuse her gunners so that after the first few broadsides she never had the exact range again.</p>
<p>We fired 734 shells including 40 in five broadsides after the "Emden" had been beached and 8 when sinking the collier.</p>
<p>The "Emden" is said to have fired about 1440 shells.  Of these perhaps 9 actually hit us though many fell not far away.</p>
<p>The guns were very hot, even up to late in afternoon.  The aft gun fired about 100 rounds and became so heated that through the expansion of the metal, after the few had run out through recoil, the springs were unable to bring it back to original position.  Many rounds were fired while the gun was run out unable to resume its proper position.  This difficulty was experienced with other gun salvo.  The paint was blistered and burnt on most of the guns, especially on the aft gun.</p>
