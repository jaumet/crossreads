 Sun 26th May (cont.) The long cobbled Plauerstrasse which leads to the town from the lager is bordered with barracks on the outskirts of the town. 
 The old gate towers of the walls of medieval Brandenburg still remain standing;   the modern town is congested, narrow, &amp; provincial.   One little detail pleased both of us &ndash; encircling the light standards some 12 feet from the ground are baskets of petunias and geraniuns, now in full bloom. 
 At a service (non-demoninational) in the evening, conducted by Harrison.   Ted (H.Y. Rodell, "Colchester") is organist.   The Catholic and Russian altars, the Jewish synagogue, a boot repairing shop, &amp; the camp theatre are all housed in portions of one long barrack.   The two altars are side by side;   when one is in use a curtain is drawn across the other.
