lively when once aboard the lugger.  There is nothing to write about now.  I just fill in the time as pleasantly as possible & as Ellis will tell you I am not allowed to leave Camp.
I must go down to the Y.M.C.A. for a cup of Tea & a bit of cake.  The food we get is plentiful but the old story that "God sends food & the Devil sends cooks" still prevails & most of the food is spoilt.
Soon I shall be meeting you all & Oh! I just had a spasm of excitement.  What a time, what a re-union.  I try not to think about it, for fear the time seems weary & long.
Best Love to you allHarry
