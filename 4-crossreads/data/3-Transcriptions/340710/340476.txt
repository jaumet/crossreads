<p>Chapter VI<br/>Egypt Again</p>
<p>Tel-el-Kebir<br/>Egypt<br/>10.1.16.<br/>As you will see by <strike>my address</strike> the above we came to Egypt as prophesied by Me- the Prophet.  [Next sentence crossed out]  Some say we are off to France, some Mespot and even India seems to have found a place but France seems to be the general favorite.<br/>This is the spot where the famous battle of the 80's was fought and across the canal from our camp stands the monument to those of ours who fell.  This is the only thing that commends the place at all for otherwise it is sand and filthy Arabs.  Occasionally in the stilly night one hears the bleat of the jackal or the cackle of the hippopotamus</p>
