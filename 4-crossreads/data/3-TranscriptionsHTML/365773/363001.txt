<p>Getting very close to the time now when I will see your dear face again - seems ages &amp; ages since that wet day in October /14 when I last saw you. We will be in Fremantle tomorrow morning &amp; won't we be up early to get a glimpse of the best country in the world again - you cannot imagine how homesick I am - didnt realise myself till now the time is so close.<br/>This ship is a Hospital carrier, full of badly crippled men, the only fit men on board being a few officers like myself &amp; orderlies for duty</p>
