After seeing Kelly off, I went to Horseferry Rd. Headquarters   &  reported. Told to be ready at 2.30 p.m.   &  car would take me   &  my luggage to Southwell Gardens. Arrived there about 3. p.m.   &  got my luggage into Hall, when told that orders had just come through got me to go to Southall with two sisters for operation   &  to nurse them, so we   &  our luggage got into car   &  got to Paddington Station to find we had nearly one hour to waite. Got out here at 5. p.m.   &  handed the sisters. over to the Matron.
Explained to her that I had been promised that night off to go to dinner   &  theatre with some friends. Well, she said I could catch a train at 5.18 p.m.   &  go to the theatre, so I made a rush for it   &  caught the train
