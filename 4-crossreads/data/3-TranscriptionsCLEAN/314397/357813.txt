 Thursday 22.8.18 Only an inspection this morning. Had a swim. Two more of my platoon have just come back from the Divvy Wing. Marshall & Teale. Teale is the Div. Champion Heavyweight Boxer. Looks a very decent sort of a boy. 
 Friday 23.8.18 Fritz came over last night & gave us tons of his eggs. They were very close too. Reported to B.O.R. at 9a.m for the school. The valise & packs went to the station in a limber & the 2 sergeants & I went to Vequemont by lorries. Walked about till the train came in & met tons of officers I knew. Bill Stewart, Tommy Sard, Garnsey, Jenkins & a bit more. Left Vequemont at 2pm & went to Vignacourt. This was small guage. Had to walk from Vignacourt to Pernois (about 4 or 5 Kilo.) Had a cup of tea here & then caught a train
