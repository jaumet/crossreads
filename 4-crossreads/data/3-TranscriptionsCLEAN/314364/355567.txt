Sat. Mar. 15thThe awning has been removed from the roof of our Hospital, & as it is somewhat draughty without it, we now make use of the empty cabins. One doesn't feel quite so fresh when waking up in the morning, but being able to hop straight into the Bath has its advantages.I was having a yarn with the Chief Officer this morning & he said that if we were to call at Adelaide, Melbourne & Hobart it would be about 14 days before we reached Sydney.  I hope to goodness we don't have to go into Quarantine at Sydney or that we don't have to go round to Brisbane with the Boat; as they say the ship's staff has to do. [indecipherable] more days before I have the pleasure of seeing B.E.  O well, I suppose I can stand it, as I've stood it so long.Sun. Mar. 16.Well, I reckoned on this trip taking about 6 weeks, but I'm afraid I'm a bit out of it. It was very assuring to see the crew having their temps. taken this morning. One chap held his head up in the air, just as if he were balancing a feather on his nose. Postill is away on the Temp. racket, which means that I have to do a bit more work. The sun is shining & the sky is a glorious blue. I wonder what B.E. is doing today. Another Sunday to go & I ought to be a bit nearer my Goal. It seems might hard to realise that we are nearly Home. Everyone says the same, too.We had some very nice Roast Lamb & Baked Potatoes for Dinner today, which made me think of Home. I wonder how Kirkbride is enjoying himself in Quarantine.
