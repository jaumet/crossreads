<p>soft easy chairs all over the place bonzer writing tables with all conveniences, &amp; plenty of small tables with papers, matches, games &amp; etc on them, the windows of which there are 6 large ones with 3 bays to each are heavily curtained &amp; fine pictures hang on the walls &amp; big bookcases are placed here &amp; there, while the floor has a lovely carpet on it that thick &amp; soft that you can't be heard walking on it, while at both ends of this comfortable room big bright coal fires are burning for although it is Summer time it needs a fire I have scarcely seen the sun since I have been in London, at any rate such is the room &amp; comforts here just imagine a chap</p>
