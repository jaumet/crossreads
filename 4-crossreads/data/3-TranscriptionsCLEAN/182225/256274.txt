JUNE   MONDAY 5   1916
It came up very windy and a roughish sea. We left Durban at 8 AM and after dropping the pilot turned south. They say we call in at Capetown  anyway I hope we do. There were a few girls down to see us off but not many  It got very windy & some fair waves towards afternoon  One broke the bridge in bow of the ship and washed the big rope down. Not many sick but a few went out to it. It was pretty choppy about mid-day, the bridge in front of the ship got broken again in evening  We can see lava most of way round I hear.
