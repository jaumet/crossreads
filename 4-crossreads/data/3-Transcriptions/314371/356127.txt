<p>[Transcriber's note:   Sgt. James C. Lindsell was a Machine Gunner in the 14th Machine Gun Coy., A.I.F.  This, his third, diary commences in England but only for 2 days before he leaves Folkestone for Boulogne on 24 April 1917.  He then moved on to the area around Albert and Bapaume and joined the 14th Machine Gun Coy at Ligny Thilloy.  The men moved to the Front Line on 8th May and he describes the intense fighting in which he was involved until he was injured and returned by train to Boulogne where he was admitted to hospital.  He returned to his unit on 15th June and was involved in some training before they were moved to Ypres.  Once again there was heavy fighting which he describes, also the casualties which occurred in the area around Westhoek Ridge.  While here he was badly injured in the chest, was carried out by stretcher and then put on a train for Etaples where he was hospitalised.  When he had recovered sufficiently he left hospital in early December, went from Calais to Dover and then to the Sholden Lodge Auxiliary Hospital at Deal in Kent.  After leave in February 1918, he boarded the Dunvegan Castle on 13th March to return home via South Africa, where he spent nearly six weeks before continuing his journey on the Tofua.  He arrived in Sydney about the middle of June. ]</p>
