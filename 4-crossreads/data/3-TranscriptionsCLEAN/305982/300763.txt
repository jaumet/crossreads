Gad what a display of artillery from both sides  Fritz did put it at us all night  Gave company on our right hell of a doing very dimoralising he has been shelling us all day long our Batt supported by next to us [indecipherable] last one  I never expected to see the stunt come of as well as it did very slight loses. coming over but now we are loosing.  Fritz did not counter attack but we expect him too to night.  Boys great on mementos.  Fritz prisoners very shy poor devils don't want to fight
