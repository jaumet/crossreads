Vecquemont
down to the General. Talked about the recent stunt which is a mess up for him to open up with and shows lack of thought. Dined afterwards with him and the Staff and came back to my dugout for a round or two of paper warfare and eventually I hope, a bath.
20/8/18
Another hot and busy day. Camped in dugouts bivvies facing the wooded valley of the River Somme. Band played for a while and all the Coys went for a swim to the river after lunch. Extremely warm and unpleasant in the mess and there were also plenty of flies.
