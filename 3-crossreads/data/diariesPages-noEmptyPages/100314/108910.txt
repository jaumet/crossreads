7/3/18 Boulogne
Breakfasted at the Club. A fine sunny mild day. At 9.58 caught the Calais-Dover express in Company with others and we reached Calais at noon. Went round and dined at the Officers Club passing Rodins statue of the Burghers of Calais in their English chairs. It is a dull an uninteresting place and many Belgians are about. On a windy day there is no more unpleasant and beastly place than this town. Caught the 1 o'c train for Bailleul and changed at Hazebrouch. Railway travelling is becoming quite good and like peace conditions. The mens trucks are covered with a wooden top and stoves are put in them. Arriving at Bailleul ? found the old place thronged with Australians
