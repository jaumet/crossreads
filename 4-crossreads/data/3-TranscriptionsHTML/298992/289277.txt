<p>Tuesday night. As we were anxious to get away from here as soon as possible &ndash; that night is possible, I went ashore straight away to see the Commissioner (Mr. Elliot), and see if he would grant me a Clearance and Bill of Health. Had rather a merry time landing too. We had hove to about 1 mile from the shore, and I got 5 niggers from aboard the ship to row me ashore.  There was a big surf running, and I was wondering how we were going to get through the passage in the Reef. It is only about 20 feet wide and on either side is the sharp jagged coral on which the breakers were smashing with a roar. However the Native at the steering oar said he "savvied" the passage alright, so I told him to go right ahead and make for the Government Wharf inside the Reef. We were just about opposite the passage where we were to enter, when a voice hailed us from the Phosphate Company's Wharf &ndash; which extends just out past the Reef &ndash; and said the passage was very dangerous just then as it was low tide, and that we had better land at the Co's wharf. We back-watered just in time to save us from shooting through the passage, and rowed for the other Wharf, where a rope was let down &ndash; the Wharf being about 20 feet above the level of the water, on account of the low tide &ndash; and I clambered up, giving the niggers orders to wait in the boat till I came back.</p>
<p>I then went up to the Commissioner's house. He was just ready to turn in. I explained to him that it was important that we should get away that night if at all possible, and after a lot of arguing he consented. I then went round to the Acting Medical Officer (Mr Grimble) who had turned in, and hauled him out of bed</p>
