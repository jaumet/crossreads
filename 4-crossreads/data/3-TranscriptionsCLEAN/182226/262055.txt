 Drill in the morning, half holiday in the afternoon, we played a draw at football with the signallers. Mac & I were not playing. Mac had a crook leg & a bad eye & I was too shakey from Dysentery. 
 Our mail arrived today I got about 8 letters, one batch being mail that has been following me round for some time.
