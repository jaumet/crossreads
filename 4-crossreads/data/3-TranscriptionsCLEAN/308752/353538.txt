24th February 1918.Well, here we are up to the time of writing, & I am afraid that there is very little more to talk about, so of course will have to bring this edition to a close. Before doing so I would like to comment on a little subject that seems to be worrying a number of my friends in Sydney. During the last six months I have received quite a number of letters stating the writer would very much like to hear of me being promoted in rank etc. etc. I have stated on numerous occasions that I have absolutely no ambition to be promoted in the Army, if I just do my duty & do what I am told to do is enough for me. Censorship rules are very strict lately so will have to leave the rest to your own imagination.
Of course you might say - why don't you study some subject etc so that when I return I shall be able to continue on, in some occupation".    Well, to tell you the truth, I have tried to do this but had to give it up. This life gets a chap down, why, I can't put my mind on reading a book lately, so studying is out of the question.
The news in the papers lately, is not too bright but we must live in hopes, & pray for Victory for the Allies, & an every lasting Peace.  May this year see you all, give me a welcome Home.
