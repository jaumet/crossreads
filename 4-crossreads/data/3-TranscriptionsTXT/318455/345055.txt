to the Station some a mile away. There was a hospital train filled with men from the Palestine Front - British Australian & N.Z. Indians all burnt so brown that colour was no distinction
They were mostly malaria cases & very weak & thin  they looked It made us realize that each front has its particular hardships & the Winters of France are probably counter balanced by the flies & heat of Palestine.
After the usual delay at the Station we left started at 9 p.m. in open
