  
 December 1916 (28th continued)   There are only two sections of the company left, the other two having gone away to another town, but where to or what for, I do not know.  No.3 section is working in the other end of the town about two miles away on similar work to us, & the remainder of  number  No.4 section have been divided up, some having gone to other towns in the vicinity on special work & others remaining here for odd jobs in connection with the company. 30th   We are still on the same work & are making considerable progress.  The weather has been rather wet for the last two days & fairly cold with heavy frosts.
