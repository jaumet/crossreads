<p>on board for a couple of days, then disembarked &amp; went into camp about 10 miles from Auckland where we spent our time shooting-   We came on board again last night &amp; leave this evening- The general idea is that we are going to Wellington first-  I do hope we are not sent to South Africa but am very much afraid that will be our destination-  There are some very good fellows in the regiment but the majority are pretty rough-  I am getting used to the position of a trooper-  I am not the only commissioned officer in the ranks-  There are five of us in the regiment and two where in the Imperial Army at Home &amp; one in the Indian army-  Our officers are very young but Major Macaroll who is in command is a fine fellow.  He took me into his tent before we came away &amp; told me he was going to look upon me as his own son, he has been more than kind to me in every way-  We have just been told we are sailing in an hour</p>
