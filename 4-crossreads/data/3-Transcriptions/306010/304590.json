<p>read these things in French that are read all over France when the British Forces appear to be doing so little. (75)<br/>Tuesday 9th May<br/>Yesterday was a red-letter day for us. A <strike>march</strike> route march of the British Colonial Troops in Marseille was held in the afternoon when several thousand men took part. Never have I seen such an enthusiastic demonstration &ndash; the streets, shops, balconies &amp; windows were packed with people shouting &amp; clapping (a few crying) waving flags as well as throwing flowers &amp; distributing cakes, postcards (&amp; kisses) to the Officers &amp; Men. The only Australians that took part were 200 from the Base Details, Moussot <strike>and</strike> 4 Officers &amp; 100 N.C.Os &amp; men from No. 2 G.H. We moved off from Moussot together with 100 New Zealanders at 1.15 pm on our 5 mile march into the city to Place Castellane (the place of assembly for the route march)</p>
