  
 & Germans, each side has taken it 7 times, but we hold it for good now   I think, it fairly stinks with dead men you can't dig any where with out digging them up, & the ground once disturbed stinks like anything for it is rotten, a regular graveyard & you can see feet sticking out almost any where, & of a hot day you have to hurry round the worst parts of it, there are a few thousand buried about here I'll bet. the ground is like as if some one had dug it up about 6 ft deep & kept it stirred you can't dig a solid trench in it you have to use sand bags for the lot, & it is nothing but a mass of shell holes & craters but not as bad as the "Somme"
