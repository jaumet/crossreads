Horseferry Road, Anzac Buffet but after calling in the Policeman to my aid I was successful in getting a Taxi, the driver meanwhile grunting out "I ain’t got much petrol", we sped on our way and reached the Anzac Buffet all right.

There I got a bed on the Floor and making myself comfortable for a few hours I went to sleep, getting up early enough to catch the train for Folkestone. There were hundreds of bed in this place, some made like the berths on a ship others consisted of mattresses on the floor.

I was sorry that I did not see much of London, but one cannot get all one wants so they have just got to be content with what they get.

Dec 6th. Wed.
Getting my gear from the Head Quarters at 5 a.m and inquiring my way from a policeman, as the streets were pitch dark I ultimately reached the crowd of troops who were returning from leave at Victoria Station. The station was packed with soldiers and friends to see them off.

Getting a comfortable seat we left in the train at 7 a.m. Feeling a bit tired I sleep slept all the way.

We arrived at Folkestone at 9.45.

After some maze like wanderings
