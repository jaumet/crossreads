<p>8th January El Arish 1916 Monday<br/>I had been feeling very seedy last night and after seeing the Doctor who gave me some pills I was told to go straight to bed which I was glad to do. Well about 9.15 pm the moon was shining beautiful and bright I heard the far-off buzz of an aeroplane which I judged rightly to be a Taube, coming straight over the camp. Immediately the order was given to clear out and simultaneous with that he dropped 2 bombs just behind the 1st Regiment lines and about &frac34; of a mile from our camp they went off with a frightful crash waking any who were asleep at the time. I went out half dressed in the cold night air which did not do my condition any good and jump on the horse's back and gallop off into the night and across the open. The Taube or Taubes [It is believed that there were two of them] dropped bombs all over the place. No one in our camp we were scattered about the desert and it was quite half an hour before we got back again about 11 bombs were thrown down altogether, and hundreds of rounds from their machine guns were strewn around. Everyone took over where possible I was sick and the cold wind did not do me much good. Last night was a favourable opportunity</p>
