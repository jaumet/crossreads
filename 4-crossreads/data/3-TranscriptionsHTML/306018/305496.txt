<p>March 1918<br/>16 games were played.  I didn't do much good only scoring 100.  We finished up a little after 10.30.  Supper was provided.  The tariff was only 5 piastres.  They are going to hold something similar every Wednesday night, either a whist drive or a social.  A library has been opened at our mess.  They have over 200 books already, it should soon increase.</p>
<p>Thursday 7th<br/>The day was very cloudy close &amp; depressing.  Felt no good all day.  Played billiards at the British Recreation Club in the afternoon.  Went up to the Bank but there was no felouse.  Remained in after dinner &amp; went to bed early.  We are getting crook bread issued to us, it is very dark in colour heavy &amp; full of grit.  Most of us are buying our own bread.  The doctor has condemned the issue bread, but we get nothing in lieu of it.  The A.S.C.[?] still collect our 1/9 per day.  The Egyptian jam they issue no one will eat &amp; it is all sent back.  We wouldn't mind if they would allow us to buy our own</p>
