<p>Then our band arrived, so we had a band &amp; no ground or gear. Lt. Col Marks &amp; the Adjt. came along then, &amp; we adjourned to where we were first. Couldn't persuade the others there to give up the wicket they made, so we played on the grass, it was a very rough wicket. I was sent in first with Wilkinson, &amp; after I had scored 2, a shooter got me. We got 60, &amp; they won by 3 wickets. Was just starting to read the "Daily Mail" by candle light as usual after turning in, when the drone of a Fritz 'plane was heard, &amp; all lights were put out. The searchlight tried to locate it, &amp; our Lewis gunners poured some rounds up towards the sky. Monday 27 May<br/>Was stiff &amp; tired after the cricket yesterday, was drilling at the N.C.O's school all morning. There was no afternoon parade, on account of tonight's big stunt. I would have liked a sleep in the afternoon, but they had a scratch match, so I couldn't resist a game of cricket. My arm was stiff from yesterday, but I was bowling most of the time &amp; got 3 wickets. They made 79 &ndash; it was on the same bumpy wicket as yesterday. However, our side won, I was very tired when I finished, got top score, 26 &amp; was given run</p>
