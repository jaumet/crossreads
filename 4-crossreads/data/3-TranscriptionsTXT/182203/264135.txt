Quite intended to but slept in. Left instructions to be called but was forgotten. Had a very busy time since on Day-duty but am on a very soft thing at present. Decorating & preparing for Xmas made us really busy but it was worth it.We had breakfast half an hour later, so that all of us (day & night staff) could have it together. It was just like home, little presents with cards of good wishes on our plates.We Australian Sisters got a box of 1/2 doz Linen-handkerchiefs - beauties &  on the box a picture of an Australian Mounted Rifleman with the Rising Sun. It was a lovely idea & a great surprise to us. Had a box of lovely soap & everyso
