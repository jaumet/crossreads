Moascar14/3/16Physical drill parade getting slack owing to a lack of knowledge by the junior N.C.O's. Will fix definite programme daily. Was a member of a Court Martial which sat all day and we tried and convicted four men. One was a splendid specimen physically wearing a fine string of ribbons, the two South Africans, Ashanti India and Sudan and one nonfighter. A tiring day hearing evidence.
At 2000 the Battalion marched out to take up an outpost position about 3/4 mile away. It was moonlight and the men formed mass first without a sound and whispered words of command. Moved off similarly and our march could not have been more silently carried out. The column swung along without a scrap of noise and then we were met by guides who took us to the relief of the 21st. Told off picquets & groups and then inspected the position. Returned 2200 most noise made by rattle of entrenching tool against bayonet, - remedy tie piece of cloth round bottom of bayonet.
Elmiger remarked to Craig that the English look upon us as half savages and ready to go along whooping wildly. "Yes" says Elmiger "they expect to see us behind bars"."Well", said Craig "Won't they all be behind b-bars.
15/3/16A quiet day. Sitting on a Court Martial all the morning. Half holiday in the afternoon. Major Conway & Capt Craig warned to report to Intermediate Base probably return to Australia. Furphey we move 48 hours hence. R.S. up at Le Caire today. Drew a good pair of Zeiss glasses from Q.M. magnification 8. Notice a tremendous improvement in the discipline and bearing of men. The drill we have been having has the effect of stiffening them up. They salute with military precision and walk about stiffly turning sharp. Heard Kennedy does not come and Mac. takes second in command with Curnow crowned. General Legge and Birdwood inspected today to a smart march past. Bugles & trumpets sounding gladden one's heart. Artillery have a good band, our too shrill.
