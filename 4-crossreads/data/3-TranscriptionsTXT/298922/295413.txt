 Wednesday 28 March 1917 
 The fight is going well &amp; Regiment + 16 Officers are told off to escort prisoners to Cairo . We lost an aeroplane &amp; both men killed this morning. All is well &amp; the weather lovely at present. 
 Every afternoon we have football matches RUGBY &ndash; a game I never played being at school in Victoria it is making the men very fit &amp; well. Looking back at the Military School it did us all good &amp; served to shake together the Australian &amp; English Officers,  who are always inclined to view each other from afar off &amp; to criticize each other.
