<p>German helmets, watches or anything we might wish to collect as a souvenir, as the articles would in all probability be connected with a &quot;mine&quot;.</p>
<p>I took up my position right against the wall, under a manger, I seemed to feel safer there, rather than in the centre of the stable.&nbsp; There was a homely and cheerful smell about the place, of cows.&nbsp; I failed to get any sleep the first night, I kept wondering why these buildings had been left untouched.&nbsp; Was very glad when morning arrived, and I found myself still alive.&nbsp; Did not go out much during the day as &quot;he&quot; could see anyone passing through the gates.</p>
<p>A very fine new, guards helmet was hanging on the wall of this stable, very tempting as a souvenir, but we simply looked at but never touched it.&nbsp; A piece of new deal wood was lying in the yard, just the thing for lighting the brazier, but we just gazed on it and passed on.&nbsp; Fritz was not going to &quot;get&quot; us that way.</p>
<p>The wells of water which had not already &quot;caved&quot; in, were not fit to drink, apparently having been poisoned.&nbsp; One well however remained, which was pronounced as &quot;safe&quot;, and we would obtain our supplies from there, until one day, a few fellows were there and one of them seeing a loose end of wire, and thinking that it would trip someone up, gave a pull at it, result, none of the fellows were seen again, and the well &quot;fell in&quot;.&nbsp; That bit of wire had been attached to a mine.&nbsp; It&#39;s very often so in this world is&#39;nt it, you try to save trouble to others and come to grief yourself.</p>
<p>One night - the 29th. March &#39;17, I remember the date very well at about eight o&#39;clock, we left Vauxl, went down the hill from the buildings we occupied, past the very fine German cemetery, towards the enemy front line.&nbsp; It was very dark, our march was &quot;in silence&quot;, no smoking allowed, spoke only in whispers, picked the softest ground possible, till we arrived at a certain place where it had been decided to dig a new set of trenches.</p>
<p>The officers &quot;marked out&quot; the portions of ground for each man to dig, and then &quot;set to&quot; and dug fast as we could.&nbsp; Only a very few spades</p>
