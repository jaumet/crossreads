 Saturday 13th October 1917 
 Arrived Southhampton tonight!!!  We did not  arrive  land too rough &amp; had to put back &amp; tranship from the  "Queen Alexandria"  to the  "Antrim"  a bigger boat &ndash; all night we were buffeted about, the Channel very rough. We make another attempt tonight. No Cabins last night &amp; no tucker, but I have a cabin tonight &amp; am on shore at Cherbourg now, sitting down to a good dinner. It's a big undertaking travelling in wartime.
