<p>Thursday 31 July 1919<br/>Had a couple of parades &amp; got things straightened. Got our trunks &amp; valises over. Had another parade at 8.45 pm &amp; after a roll call they moved into the station. I went in by car with 5 or 6 officers kits after [indecipherable] wiring my name. The Major came in after me to the station &amp; said I had also to report to another Major. Missed the first train over it anyway. Still the second train will do me. We fall in at 11 pm.</p>
<p>Friday 1 August 1919<br/>Left at 1.40 am from Warminster &amp; arrived at Liverpool at 10.30 am.  Stopped at Birmingham &amp; managed to get a cup of tea &amp; some sandwiches. They were goodo too. Slept nearly all the way &amp; am still tired. The train stopped near the boat so didn't have far to go to the boat. Went straight onboard. Have a cabin with Ross Knickey and the Q.M. (Lt Howell's). Had a good lunch. Got our gear into our cabin &amp; then had dinner. Met Gus Edwards &amp; Peter Ross. Got Gus to send a couple of wires for me. Had a letter from Janet &amp; wrote her one. Am officer of the guard tomorrow. We don't pull out till tomorrow sometime.</p>
