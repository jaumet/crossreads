<p>Nobody slept at all that night &amp; the row of the singing was something awful but who cared, we were only to pleased to get away from that Land of Sand, Sun, &amp; Sorrow, to where people spoke our own language.</p>

Breakfast was over at 4 am &amp; then we set too to pull down all our tents, roll them up &amp; clean up anything else in the way of rubbish, for although this was only a desert it had to be left just as it was in the first place.</p>
