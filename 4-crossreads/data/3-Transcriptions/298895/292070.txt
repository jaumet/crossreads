<p>a few hundred yards away &amp; our guns are firing in front of us &amp; behind.  As I sit on the grass during the cool of the evening the sound of laughter &amp; happy voices can be plainly heard all round.  Football is being played and contentment apparently reigns supreme, and all within full view of at least six German observation balloons.<br/>Sunday 13th May<br/>   Not a great deal doing just the usual firing going on &amp; ordinary flow of wounded.  Had tea at the 14th Battery where I knew a few fellows.  Had a couple of taubes over, the lads firing away with their rifles at them weather hot &amp; oppressive.<br/>Monday 14th May<br/>   Spent the morning taking over &amp; sorting drugs &amp; dressings left behind by the 3rd Fd.a. their condition showing a messer of a dispenser.  Witnessed a very thrilling incident at midday.  A taube came over &amp; was promptly shelled by our batteries.</p>
