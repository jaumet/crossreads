 2 I hope you  &amp; Papa   &amp; Family are all quite well  &amp; that the war is not being felt too much in Sydney.  The Turks are, I think getting near the end of their tether as their communications are practically cut   &amp; their supplies must be uncertain   &amp; insufficient.  Malta is rather a pretty place although I have not seen much of it.  I went for a drive round in a sort of cab the other day which was very interesting. 
 Goodbye for the present love to all 
 Your affectionate son Charlie
