<p>However you are on the spot &amp; have much better opportunities of judging what is best <strike>that</strike> &amp; I have no hesitation in saying I leave it to you hence the part of my cable "decide yourself"   Whatever way you come when you get here you will have a very hearty welcome to Egypt.   I hope my cable was perfectly clear to you.   When you come bring plenty of cash &ndash; I reckon to get a nice suite of rooms for you at the Continental; you will then have time to settle down &amp; decide how you would like to live over here.  I have been looking about for a nice small house with garden close to the place where our hospital is to be;  (and it is one of the nicest districts in Cairo) there is also within 100 yards of our hospital a nice lot of flats;  but I will decide nothing till you get over here &amp; you can choose what you would like best.<br/>Before you leave let me know your boat &amp; your port of destination &ndash; I could probably arrange to meet you at either Port Said or Alexandria.   In regard to Trix, let her do whatever pleases her.<br/>Au revoir dearest old woman with best love to all,<br/>Yr Loving husband</p>
<p>Will.</p>
