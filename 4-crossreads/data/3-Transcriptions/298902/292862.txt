<p>could accommodate us so we went along &amp; had a second feed.  During the afternoon some friends who knew the camp well managed to secure accommodation in some huts with bunks &amp; fireplace so was extremely comfortable having 4 blankets, the issue being 2 &amp; all sleeping in tents it being bitterly cold.  Many fellows walk about for part of the night in order to keep warm.  A Dance being held at night Sgts only, the fair sex being mostly W.A.A.Cs appealed to me so went &amp; had a rare good time.  I met some good dancers &amp; the music &amp; floor was excellent, quite approaching old standards.  Learnt some new dances &amp; met some old friends.  Supper was also good being given in the Sgts Mess.  So far my trip to Australia was most enjoyable, I hope it remains so.</p>
