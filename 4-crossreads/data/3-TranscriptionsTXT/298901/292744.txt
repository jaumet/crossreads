 Thursday 20th June Very quiet during the day but had 50 through last night.  Spent some time fixing up a blanket store etc so had a busy day myself.

 Friday 21st June Wet &amp; fine throughout the day.  Very little doing except sick. Italians holding well &amp; claims 9000 prisoners not bad for the defensive.  But I wish that we also had the Austrians to deal with 
 Saturday 22nd June Very quiet &amp; wrote several letters.  One of our best men Harry Fleischmann D.C.M. was killed yesterday, one of the bravest of the brave &amp; we had two men wounded.  Had word through that I have received the M.S.M. but it has not come through officially.
