Suppose she is well. Give her my love   &  tell her to write. So glad Edmund called to see you   &  told you how well I am. I'm very strong   &  have a number of good pals but shall never fall in love with anyone again. So can be quite happy    &  do my work without worrying. Fondest love   &  kisses to you all.
FromYours lovinglyEdith
