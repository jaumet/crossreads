 It was very sleepy body of men when they alighted on the platform but the fresh morning air soon had everyone wide awake. After waiting for a short while the party was marched to a big Imperial rest camp where we were told we would remain for a couple of hours. While waiting here rations were issued followed by a very rough &amp; scanty breakfast which served as a good breaking in for the future. Our next move took place at 9AM when the party was marched through Folkestone down onto the wharf &amp; straight about the S.S. princess Henry a channel troopship embarking about 10 AM. The ship was crowded to standing room with trips, who were mostly Imperial men returning to France after their furlough at home. Things were quiet on board for everyone seemed very sorry for themselves. Remembrances of the past few days were still fresh in their minds but were rapidly overcome by thoughts of the future for no one knew what it was to be; would we ever enjoy more good times in the old country which indeed to the "Aussie" had been a home away from home. It was not long before the ship untied then headed for the channel. Once outside the harbour it made straight for France &amp; was not long before the coast line of England had faded into invisibility from the deck.  Back to France  On arriving back in France on the 2nd of October 1917 we found it to be exactly the same as when we left there some months previous.

When we arrived at the camp the party was allotted to tents then being able to indulge in a well earned rest. There was nothing doing in the camp that day so late in the afternoon several of us obtain leave to go into the city of La Havre. The time spent in the city was very enjoyable for there are many places of interest but the most of these could not be seen owing to the darkness for lights were very much restricted on account of enemy aircraft. After a very pleasant night out we returned to camp about midnight &amp; after finding our tent was soon wrapped up in slumber. Next morning our party from England was issued with all necessary front line kit, such as Gas Helmets, steel hats &amp; rations also being instructed to stand bye ready to move off when required. The move took place at 4PM that afternoon, having to march to Le Havre station when we entrained in closed in trucks for the forward area. After spending all that night in the train &amp; most of the
