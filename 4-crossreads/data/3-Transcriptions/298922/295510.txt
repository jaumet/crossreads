<p>Thursday 19 July 1917</p>
<p><strike>Our last stunt was spoilt by Bedouin spies. We are too easy on these pests who are all against us. Rob our dead &amp; have a lot of equipment picked up from the Baltic fields.</strike>  Our equipment is excellent &amp; every thing Australia has supplied has been excellent. Tommy Officers are loud in praise of our Boots. Good old Australian Rabbit Skin HATS are better than any others issued &amp; the same applies to TUNICS PANTS etc. Last night an order appeared saying Rabbit Skins must be left in the sun &amp; returned to the Quarter Master daily. We still get frozen Rabbit issued.</p>
