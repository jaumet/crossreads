Dear Vol
Since writing you on 18/8/18 I've received yours of 25/5/18 &, as usual, am very glad to hear from you.
I am not replying in detail to your letter because the Anzacs are going home soon and I'll have a chance to see you.  I believe lists are being prepared in Sydney and I hope to have a trip.  I'm dubious, however, because, as I'm a cadet (that is, not an N.C.O. nor yet an officer) I may be blocked.  I've passed my final exam O.K. so would like to get my promotion before I go.  Do you know how the lists are being made up?  If you can tell me my how my chance is I'd be grateful.  I've asked my brother Harry to look into it but doubt if he is sufficiently in the know.  I'm real anxious for the trip, as you can imagine, hence my reason for asking.
I saw Ernest last weekend
