  
 You will be tired of listening to this everlasting war chatter, but as I said before our world is very limited here. 
 I hope to be able to tell you in my next of my first impressions of the "air". I am going up in an observation baloon to have a look at the country - directly we get a fine day. The weather has been rather inclement for the sport of late. Many of our chaps have been up for a spin in a plane but I have not achieved it yet, as it is rather difficult to get away. 
 I hope your old enemy rheumatism has been absent during this winter. You did not mention it in your last, so I trust you have weathered round the cold months without an attack. 
 No more news just now, so will close, with love from 
 Your affectionate Son  Terence W.Garling
