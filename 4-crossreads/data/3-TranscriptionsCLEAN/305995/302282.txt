  
 Dear Mum: - 
 This is just a little account of our scrap that I thought would interest you & if possible would like Ruby to see it, as I cannot spare time to pen her a duplicate. 
 I am answering your letter of July 2nd under seperate cover. 
 Give love to tell, Kit & all at home, & accept the best of love & kisses from your loving son 
 Birk 
 Keep this account in sight as much as possible, so I can give you more details when I come back & compare with my diary.
