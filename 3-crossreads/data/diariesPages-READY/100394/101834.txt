Had a church parade today out in a very pretty paddock among the trees. One expression the parson used struck me as being worth recording "Lord if I forget thee, do not then forget me. 28 of us have orders to proceed to the firing line tomorrow at a moments notice. Had tea again at our farmhouse of last night. We are taking over from the 4th Division

Got away from our Camp about 6 p.m. in motor omnibuses. Passed through Haverskenm and Merville and got out at a place called Enquinghem and walked about 3 miles to Bois Grenier about 3 miles from Armentieres. We have a splendid billet here in a farm house which for some reason hasn’t been shelled for 18 months, and all other farm houses round about have. There will be no range finding to do here as everything is done by accurate maps

July 11A few shots came over this morning pieces of shell &c. but this place is nothing to Anzac in fact we are going to have a regular picnic. They guns are very well concealed and well covered with earth reinforced concrete bricks and stone, sand– bags and more earth on top with grass growing on top. I am on telephone duty for the time being, telephone attendant, linesman or anything that comes along.

Had a very fatiguing day. We took over finally from 48th Battery on duty telephones from 3 to 6 a.m. After breakfast Bob and I went round some of our communications and up in the firing line 29th Batt. This is called the Nursery. We were shelled very heavily today and several batteries round us had to move. They got very close to our guns. The rest of our boys came along tonight and the left section moved round to their position near Armentieres.
