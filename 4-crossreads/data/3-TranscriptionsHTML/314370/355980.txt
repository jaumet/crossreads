<p>February, 1916<br/>Friday 11<br/>Work all day priming the class up ready for their first exam.  Most of them are in a mortal funk.<br/>Weather cold &amp; damp.</p>
<p>Saturday 12<br/>Description Exam takes up all morning, but I am disappointed at my class, they did not do well at all, but had a hard examiner &amp; used some hard words on him, but better luck next time.<br/>Our Colonel returns from his holiday &amp; everybody glad to see him back</p>
