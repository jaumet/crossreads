<p>nature, and a promise of a moonlight trip to Sphinx &ndash; then I had in mind money I"d cabled for.  Such was my damned luck that when I"d paid what I owed, I"d nothing left and we couldn"t do the trip under &pound;1 so had to 'pass" it.  The night of the dinner made up for it though.</p>
<p>Jan. 24.  A most auspicious occasion.  Out with Capt Beers to 2nd Base and Anglo Egypt Bank.  Caught by rain, ripped back in the Ford, got a bit wet.  Beers took us in and gave us a whiskey and soda each.  Felt Better! and a nice fellow.  'Now let your bloody cat in."  This was the first dinkum whiskey and soda I"ve had &ndash; and the last.  Vermouth or Curacao will do me every time.</p>
<p>Jan. 29.  George came up from Warden.  Went out with Dick for afternoon:  started with intention of going to see Ron at Maadi.  Got as far as Babaluk.  Had afternoon tea there and drove back through the Mouski to St. James.  Had been there, swapped drinks with 2 1 L.H. chaps and spent evening in El Dorado &ndash; Realised in Camera.</p>
<p>End of January</p>
<p>116  (210) (225)<br/>This evening, moving some tarpaulin, under one was a lovely moth.  Brown and white banded large wings, a body and head of pure vermilion, and under wings of vermilion with large blackish circles.</p>
<p>What a scheme for interior decoration.  Deep rich nut brown walls &ndash; smooth, woodwork of white, hearth tiling of gold, curtains of vermilion &ndash; pictures in Gilt frames.  Brass Jacobean candlestick &ndash; coloured wood cuts and etchings and books behind glass in white case on white shelves.  Till this afternoon olive green and [indecipherable] had it.  Now it is this.  The brown for the walls would be the difficulty, getting the exact shade.  I think sepia Indian ink, used as a distemper on ordinary pale paper already hung would be successful.  Bought paper, ordinary Brown paper (wrapping) while some shades would be good I don"t think would be good.  The usual brown rough heavy velvet colour brown is horrible, unoriginal.</p>
<p>Hearth tiles of canary yellow, Dutch make in squares about  3" should strike a rather happy note.  Altogether the suggestion from the moth is worth working out.</p>
<p>117  Aug. 3 1916<br/>Received today a Money Order &pound;2 and forwarded it on to Controller, Money Order Dept. G.P.O. London for exchange of one on Boulogne.  For Record &ndash; No. 8265 - &pound;2 on Cairo Egypt.</p>
<p>Posted at Military P.O. in Boulogne parcel of books, and bought Seaman"s new booklet of Verse, and his "Borrowed Plumes" also Leacock"s "Moonbeams from the Larger Lunacy".</p>
<p>118  Aug. 8<br/>With today"s lot of clothing from the fumigator, in one of the much muddied tunics, unharmed, was a small black canvassed covered pocket book.  The first entries were barren and uninteresting:  details of platoon, etc. and &ndash; more interesting &ndash; details of construction of hand grenades, bombs etc.:  following a list of names of men in 'No. 12" Platoon, and then came the diary.  From notes at the back, "left Boulogne Jan. 8 &ndash; marched to Abbeville to Ally-le-Clocher [possibly Ailly-le-Haut Clocher] Jan. 9 1916" etc. and from difference in writing the diary was evidently written up during rests.  It started, and with a [indecipherable] right through for times.</p>
