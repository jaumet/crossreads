Sunday 7
 Move back to Dickebush for next 24 hours. The weather is awful, wet, the conditions up the line must be worse than previously.
Monday 8
 Spend day at Dickebush tonight we move up to Westhoek tunnell. We are due for a stunt in the morning but the more important part of it is on our left to the sea.
Tuesday 9
 The result of this mornings stunt is successful. The artillery on our side is very active but Fritz is comparatively silent. In a great air duel one Fritz decended in flames one of ours came down. The airman came through our post but was dead. From the artillery just now 6 p.m. a counter attack is in progress.
Wednesday 10
 Move back to about 4 Kilos north of Poperinghe. What is exactly in the wind I know not but rumour has it that we move from this area.
 The Australian part of this last stunt was a great success now all the high ridge commanding all the surrounding country is in our hands.
 The treatment the 1st Field meets out to its men is anything than a credit to the unit regards food, clothes general.
Thursday 11
 The weather we are now having gives evidence of the rapid approach of winter, raining off on daily.
 Visit Poperinghe see Eric Greenwell. Poperinghe is much the same as last year but in darkness. Enemy aerial activity
Saturday 13
