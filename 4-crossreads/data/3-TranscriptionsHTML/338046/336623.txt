<p>1917<br/>Nov 14<br/>at our destination just about dusk. The Sigs had a big dugout which would have withstood a fair-sized shell landing on it. the trenches were all duckboarded and held up at the sides by wire frames so that things were very dry. One night the Hun gassed the valley that we were in with tear gas but the wind soon blew it away. The enemy was very quiet and we ahd nothing much to do except take our regular shift on the phone at HQ. at nightime we would hear the occasional mutter of machine guns. The Hun used to worry the front line and advanced posts with "minnies" and "pigeons". Nesbitt and Taylor two of the sigs that had come across with us had joined D Company and had only been in the line about 10 minutes when a minnenwerfer landed right next to their dugout, killing Taylor and giving Nesbitt shell shock. The dugout fell in on top of them. Nesbitt got out and wandered round</p>
