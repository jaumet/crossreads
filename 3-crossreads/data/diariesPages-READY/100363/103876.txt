arters in the ramparts. We had lunch together and a chat over old times. I then did a little "pottering" amongst the ruins and returned via Motor lorry transport to Steenvoorde.
9th Nov
Car still in repairs. Received orders from Headquarters to proceed to Egypt. An active campaign is there in progress and it has been thought a good opportunity for me to secure historic pictures. At present there is no official photographer with the forces. I am keen however, to do a little more completion work in the Salient, though for all practical purposes it can be considered complete. Major Webb called during the evening and he, Wilkins and self dined in Steenvoorde. Webb stayed with me the night at our quarters.
