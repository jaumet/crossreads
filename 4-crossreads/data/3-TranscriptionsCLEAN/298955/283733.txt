Passed through 11.30 am. Great excitement here with the usual populas made up mostly of blacks & sprinkled with whites. This black labour is imported from Jamaica & the adjacent islands the natives of the country here do no work to speak of that is the Panamanians. The workers get 16 cents an hour that is 8d. They have the 8 hours a day system & overtime after that time Sunday & holidays  are all the same to them. The white girls looked very pretty in their cool beautifully white dresses with their coloured ribbons pink & blue stuck in their hair, most of them came although it was very hot with out hats & their complexion is very good indeed  what amused us was to see the native women who are as black as coal with parasols up to save their complexion afraid I suppose of freckles. About 1/2 mile from this lock we entered the famous Culebra Cut which is 9 miles long,
