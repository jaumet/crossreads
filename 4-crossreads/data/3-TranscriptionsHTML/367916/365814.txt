<p>2<br/>full of gas which I think will probably be futile.</p>
<p>I've had one U.K. leave since being in France but leave is a thing of the past, until, I should say, the Winter comes along. Australia is a better place now altho' there are some merry souls there whom I'd just as soon fire a shell at, as at Fritz, I mean the merry Irish &amp; Laborites. Only thing for them is to pray a raider gets out &amp; shells some of the Australian capital cities.</p>
<p>My young brother is in the R.A.F. &amp; has had his Wings some time, in fact its going on for a year since he landed in England &amp; my other brother when last I heard was in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Taking it all round things are pretty slow &amp; one gets fed up pretty soon. I've forgotten all the law I ever knew &amp; have a good mind to stick to the Army, altho' I have done in several Colonels while acting as Prisoner's Friend on a D.C.M. The trouble is, if you tie up the President, he roars like an enraged bull &amp; openly asserts his need of lunch.</p>
<p>I have no news of any interest as the Censor would delete any thing I could say.</p>
<p>Please remember me to Mrs. Ferguson &amp; the family.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely<br/>[P.L. Summers]<br/>2/Lt.</p>
