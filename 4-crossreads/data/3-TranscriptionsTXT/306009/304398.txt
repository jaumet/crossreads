 1915 Aug. 2 Mon. At 8.30 p.m. 10 of us started off on a 2 hours run in a motor boat on the Nile &amp; completely circumnavigated Gezira Island. Some of our party partook of liquid refreshment during the evening &amp; one chap was so alcoholically embarrassed that 3 of us had to put him to bed after he was assisted up from the landing stage. By Jove! His antics were funny! Needless to say I kept clear of the "booze".
