<p>There was a great shower of rain in Cairo yesterday, just a nice steady soaking rain for about 2 hours; I don&#39;t suppose much more than half an inch fell, but every body thinks it was wonderful, biggest fall for 19 years. It was funny to see the streets all under water - there is no drainage you know and the water off the roofs of the houses just falls straight down on to the footpath and its a regular shower bath to walk along them.</p>
<p>Nearly all the houses let the water in<s>to</s> <s>them</s> too, even our Hqtrs, which was a big Hotel before the war, got full of water and nearly all the shops were the same. Sayours told me they lost 1400 prints and only just managed to save the negatives from getting wet. In some places the kerb stones were the only part of the street out of water, and it was jolly funny to see people doing the tight rope act up and down the street on these.</p>
<p>I had a card from Bill West&#39;s Mother the other day and am going to write to her<s>e</s>. Bill is still out at the Cadet school and Jim is with me on HQ. Jim says those <s>bul</s> bulbs he sent should only be put half way in the ground <s>of</s> as they are likely to rot if water gets on top of them and he thinks you ought to scrape the earth away from round them if you have planted them at all deeply.</p>
