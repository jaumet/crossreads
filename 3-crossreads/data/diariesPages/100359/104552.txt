Friday May 26th 
Kept jolly busy burning off superfluous stuff so as to be clear when we have to move.
This morning it was read out on Parade, that Gen. Godley was greatly impressed by the 5th Division, and that he was very sorry to lose such a fine body of men, but "Eqypt's loss is France's gain"; which all sounds very nice. It is heartbreaking to see some of the stuff that is getting burnt, but we can't carry too much about with us and so the poor old Sanitary Police are kept busy.

Still burning off. Tons of stuff getting dumped. By jove, it's easily understood how a war costs millions, Mac Dougall, and I went down for a swim in the canal, which was very enjoyable after having been working in the bloomin? incinerator all day. Capt. Wooster told Mac and I that we were to stay behind to hand the camp over to the Welsh Division who are taking our places.
Sunday, May 28th. 
Reveille at 3.30 Breakfast at 4, Rolled our blankets and loaded them on to waggons. The crowd marched away with packs up (for the first time) at 5.15 and right well they looked. There were 5 of us left behind with Capt. Woodster, Cosier, Matthews, Mac and myself and Harry Doutch. An advance party of R.A.M.C. came into camp last night. We straightened up all the tents and got the stuff burning nicely when the Sanitary squad corporal arrived on the scene with 20 niggers. We set the niggers on cleaning out the incinerator and scrubbing out the cookhouse then they took clean sand and scattered it all round the cookhouse and we left everything in tip top condition. We had everything finished by 9 o'clock then we had some breakfast. Beef Tea and cocoa, then we all had a shave and a wash and loaded up our packs. Capt Wooster told us that we could do as we liked the rest of the day and gave us a pass for Ismalia.
