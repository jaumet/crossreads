  
 14th  Up early this morning for we are moving on again, breakfast 6.30 & after that we had to get everything cleaned up huts all, & move off at 7.30, we marched out punctually to time & skirted Poperinge" with its tall towers & spires showing up nicely against the clouds, we walked steadily on spelling for 10 minutes after each hour of walking, the roads were in fine condition & the weather cool & I think it was one of the best marches we have done for practically never a man fell out during the 12 miles & that is pretty good considering we were carrying every thing we possessed  I saw Tom Flattley on the way down just over the Franco-Belgian border, we went through a town right on it "Watou Abeel" here
