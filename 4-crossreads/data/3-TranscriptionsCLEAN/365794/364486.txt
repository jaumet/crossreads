  
 Monday 25th March 1918 Off Monday evening 8 p.m.  Went first to town to ask for Cpl. Shaw, then Heliopolis in "brown" car & exchanged stockings. A gloomy day for all who hear a report that we are driven back 17 miles on the Western front & though contradicted yet one feels very anxious.  All lights shaded in trams etc. & Cairo more or less dark as regards lights but so pretty in the moonlight.
