  
 A Rumour is running rife (if they do run like that - I forget)  concerning a stunt tonight at midnight However as Bernard is still undisposed it is unlikely that I shall go out. June 21st I was right, our Intelligence Bureau was correct even if its methods were somewhat devious. The  Stunters started at 3 oclock this morning, I, I am thankful to say, not among the number. Iron mongery in the Beef!! A certain hesitation  & circumspection
