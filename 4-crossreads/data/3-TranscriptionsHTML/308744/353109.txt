<p>Only two hangars out of eight remained at the Aerodrome at KH.AJLAN at and the camps here had considerably decreased.  A reconnaissance in the morning reported our cavalry advancing rapidly in D35 and K25 (D5). Our cavalry were also reported advancing on DHAHERIYEH from the West. The line of our advanced cavalry in the centre was defined by the evening reconnaissances as follows:-<br/>KH. JELAME &ndash; a point 1&frac12; Miles West of ZEIDAN &ndash; EH. AJLAN and thence East crossing the railway at KH. ES. SUKRIYEH.<br/>Rolling stock was reported as follows:- JULIS, 30; WADI SURAR JUNCTION 60;<br/>EL TINE 16; and ARAK-EL-MENSHIYE 60,</p>
<p>BOMBING</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, concentrations of enemy troops, dumps, and centres of activity behind the lines were bombed. On the night of the 6TH/7TH moonlight was taken advantage of to bomb the defences South of GAZA. On the 7th and 8th the 40th Wing  assisted by the 5th Wing, and "B" Squadron, bombed and machine gunned retiring columns as far North as MENSHIYE.  Many direct hits on formations of troops were registered. The aerodrome at MENSHIYE was also subjected to two heavy bomb raids 8th with very satisfactory results.</p>
<p>On the first raid one hangar was set on fire and numerous bombs were seen to explode in the midst of and near 7 machines which were drawn up close together outside the hangars. The Railway Station alongside the Aerodrome, at which two trains were standing,  was also taken as a target. The railway was blown up on the North side of the station, and several direct hits were registered on rolling stock. On the afternoon raid on the same day, six of the seven machines still remained on the aerodrome, being, presumably, in too damaged condition to move. The trains in the station had not been removed, but on the approach of our machines one engine with one truck escaped in a Northerly direction, leaving the remainder.</p>
<p>Bombs were again dropped on the railway and rolling stock with excellent results. In all, during the week, six thousand three hundred an sixty pounds of bombs were dropped, 318 explosives and 2 incendiary with, on the whole exceptionally good results. In addition to bombing troops, machines on many occasions descended to a low height, and scattered the enemy machines gun fire.</p>
<p>COMBATS IN THE AIR.<br/>During the period under review the enemy have shown considerable aerial activity in reply to the large amount of work which has been carried out by the Royal Flying Corps. Eighteen separate fights, with formations varying in number, have taken place, and, on practically every occasion, the enemy aircraft have been either brought down or driven down to within a few 100 feet over their own lines, or in the case of our slower types, the attacks have been repulsed.<br/>On the afternoon of the 6th a determined attempt was made to challenge our supremacy by formations of from 2 to 4 enemy aircraft.<br/>Of these, two were driven down and forced to land away from an aerodrome and thirteen driven off and prevented from crossing our lines, and in only two instances were our machines sufficiently damaged to necessitate abandoning the work in hand.</p>
<p>During the week, the fighting machines of the Army Wing have protected, by offensive patrols, the artillery and contact patrol machines of the Corps Wing, and have escorted reconnaissance and bombing formations with the result that all our machines have returned safely from these duties, and on numerous occasions enemy aircraft have been encountered and prevented from reaching our lines. One enemy aircraft has been brought down in flames, and others forced to land away from their aerodrome.</p>
