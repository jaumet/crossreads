 2.  train back to Bulford. Yesterday I went to Salisbury again &amp; spent my time in the usual way.  It was nice &amp; cool &amp; the ride on the Bike was good.  Ellis &amp; I laid Linoleum down on the floor of our Room this morning.  It looks quite nice now. We are both doing well.  We have had no mail for some Time, but we don't expect many letters now.  Well, Dad, Mum &amp; George, I have    had    no news to give You, so as I have all the roll Books to make up &amp; some more letters to answer, I'll have to wind up.  I do not think that the other letters will be looked at to-day.  I have only spent 2 afternoons &amp; nights in this Camp since last Friday week &amp; one night I was on Duty &amp; I'm on again to-night. I may go over to the Isle of Man on Thursday for a couple of Days. Well, Dear Ones, I must hurry up with my work.  Ellis has gone to Sarum or Salisbury on the Bike.
