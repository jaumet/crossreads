Then did some shopping & then to the Council Chambers & heard a council meeting. Had lunch there & had a look at the museum. It was great. After this I had a look at St. Giles Church & gee it is great as good as any I've seen. Then went out to Comely Bank again. Auntie was much better & was up. Had tea & then uncle & I went to some movies & then back home for supper. Got a big parcel of greens to take back to London for Marie. 
 Wednesday 26 February 1919 Went to Lambert's & tried the suit on. It looks very well indeed. Then over to the Caledonian Station & got the train to Glasgow. Wandered around till 1.45 pm (an hour) had lunch & then met Harry. She had to go back to the kids so I went out to see Alice Vernon. She is a very homely sort of person & persists in making one keep eating. The two boys came home & I showed them how to play marbles etc & gave them a general rough vocabulary. Gave Arthur one of my wristlet watches & 2/- to Ernie. Harry then came along & she & Alice took me to along to meet Ernest. He was a door Keeper at Clara Butt's concert. Then took Harry & Alice to dinner at the Grosvenor & then caught the train to London
