  
 December Monday 1915 1.30 AM In two hours I should be off the Peninsula, with the rear guard the Garrison have all gone wearing  soks  on their boots for silence - Time drags 1000's Turks are in front watching us, but they are puzzled at our silence - a few shells on the beach & Machine guns that is all - so far - I scribble this in the signal dugout - on board SS Prince [indecipherable] 4 A We were the last to leave & had a good run, I have only what I stand up in - 1 p.m. Transhipped to a larger boat the SS Elelle where we will be drafted & landed at different camps at mudros - for a few days. Now I am going for a hot bath  then a sleep.
