<p>junction of the two companies. One man (Walker A Coy) was killed and others wounded and gassed. The redoubtable Barney Horan was among the latter. Willoughby got a slight whiff but I refused to allow him to remain at the Transport and packed him off to the hospital. Ruthven &amp; Turner commissioned today. Had numerous visitors at my bedside mostly my own officers who are good chaps and with whom I much enjoy a yarn. Our new gains on the front have not been challenged by the Hun. Sent Abercrombie up the line to take the place of officer casualties. Went to sleep at about 10 p.m. and had a most refreshing sleep that lasted the whole night through. Did not wake up until &frac14; to 9 am</p>
