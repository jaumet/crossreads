<p>Wednesday 24 April '18<br/>Last night we slept in full dress expecting a call up theme, but it never came.<br/>Instead Fritz came over with swarms of planes &amp; bombed the whole district for hours. It was very late before I got to sleep.<br/>The stunt we heard of came off. Some of our chaps attacked Meteren, but, although they gained some ground, it is uncertain if they took the village. I fancy not.</p>
