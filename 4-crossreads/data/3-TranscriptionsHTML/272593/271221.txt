<p>for some considerable time.<br/>6th.  Last night we moved from the support trenches at Pilgrim's way &amp; made for the firing line to do our two days in misery,  we were lucky again for we got through the barrage which Fritz puts down the little valley opposite Guedecourt of a night time for he knows that all relieving troops go up this gully, we kept well up towards Guedecourt &amp; so missed nearly all the shelling,  there is one very dangerous place the Chalk pits &amp; round here there has been a lot of casualties. the fatigue party following us ran into a big shell or two &amp; got smashed about. Tommy Bradshaw &amp; a few more were killed. However we reached the firing line safely &amp; the first thing that met our eyes were a couple of dead men on</p>
