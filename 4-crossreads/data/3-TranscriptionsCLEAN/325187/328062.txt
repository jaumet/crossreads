 Still at  Gib  am trying to go over a French submarine today   We are remaining still another few days here repairing- REUTER cables are published daily at the Club so we get the worlds news- Almost time to be wishing you all at home Xmas greetings it seems absurd to think of peace on earth, just now- The Spanish women had lovely soft velvet brown eyes not hidden by a YASHMAK like they are in Egypt so we are able to see their features-  We sail tomorrow but do not know  Whether via Malta or even if we go to Salonika first or to Alexandria  where we go.
