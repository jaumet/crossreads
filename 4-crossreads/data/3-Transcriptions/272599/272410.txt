<p>1917 Sunday 20 May</p>
<p>A fine joyous day. Duties per usual. Afternoon off. Bath then sleep a little, read. Jockey sick   Wait on him. <br/>Over to cliff after tea &amp; write up diary. Back to Y.M.C.A. to evening service. Tis when we sing the peerless old hymns of our church &amp;amp childhood that the longing for home &amp; kindred rushes upon one to be once more back to the old house haunts &amp; faces.   How this heart cries out in longing for it all.  That this awful slaughter &amp;  [indecipherable]  be stopped.  That at the wickedness that stalks abroad open &amp; unashamed. War develops the beast in human beings to a shocking extent.   Is the war to be one of extermination? The Almighty's way of purging the race --- if so there are many to fall yet.</p>
