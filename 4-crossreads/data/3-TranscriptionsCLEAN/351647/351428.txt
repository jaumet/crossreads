I am very busy these days & I have such heaps of letters to write.  I always keep the Mater's going & yours & Bringagee but I'm afraid others must reckon I'm an ungrateful & forgetting pig.
Am dying to read your book.  Did you get the scarf I sent, I hope so.  Well my dear I must close tonight.  Shall send you a photo taken in Paris soon.  I hope Alison is well.  How is Mrs. Kathryn.  I'm sorry Tom isn't behaving.
Will try & write some more in the morning.
Wilk.
I've been reading your letters over again, I simply can't say what I feel but I'm that proud & grateful when I see what a pal I appear to be & I simply cannot express what it means to me.  You are an absolute dear & a brick & the Boss is a trump.  I wish I could fly back.  You don't know how I miss & long for you & the dear old place.  I put things so rottenly but I feel sure you understand.  I'm not a praying sort either & lots of things lately have made me less than ever that way but I think "God bless her"
