<p>26/9/15  Gallipoli<br/>calm their smoke goes straight up.  C.O. struck a surprise packet today.  Asked one man his occupation.  He replied "Draper's assistant".  Said CO "Rather effeminate!"  The chap replied "Oh! I don't know.  I was in the ladies hosiery and always found it emphasized my masculinity, Sir!"  Taube aeroplane was over dropping bombs.  Most like a bird &ndash; hawk.  Padres running round like lost sheep looking for their congregations &ndash; men all on duty, few can go.  Fatigues sweating up the slopes ration laden, bomb laden, ammunition laden.  All carrying boxes they look like ants.  Killing work this carrying every drop of water and every round of ammunition &ndash; it wears men to the bone.  Oilstoves are being supplied for winter use.
