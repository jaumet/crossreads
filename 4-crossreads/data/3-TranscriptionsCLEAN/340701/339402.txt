One young chap was taken out of the trenches in a state of collapse shaking like a leaf.  Breakdown I suppose.  Train loads of munitions about.  Was pulled out of bed at midnight last night & warned that a Gas attack was pending.  after standing by about 1/4 of an hour we were allowed to go back. Through the night the Germans shelled our Head Quarters with some new Gas & got the O.C. & the second.  The effect of this gas is not felt for 3 Hrs & if I am not mistaken they kept it up for nearly 9 hours.  There was plenty of Bodies festering in the sun on the field & shells of all sizes.  the 17th got a knock the other night the Germans anticipating a rush placed some machine Guns in positions in shell holes in no mans land & when the 17th rushed they were badly cut up.  The following night the Tommies got across without losing a man (the luck of the game).  I noticed some of the names of communication trenches.  Dinkum Alley, long Alley [deletion].  The sound of the Shrapnel is really vicious
