 10th Sept 1916 Sunday today. Mess orderly. Better lot than the Winchester one. Day slightly cold &amp; dull. Received first letter from Laurie. Walked to Amesbury &amp; then had a look round rotten hole. Got home at 9 oclock. 
 11th Sept 1916 Day out on manoeuvres. Part allotment of positions. I have got nil so far. Played soccer match against 26th. Result 2 to nil against us. Did not go anywhere. 
 12th Sept 1916 Started with our own HQrs in morning. Then some more military stunts. All put together signallers from Div. HQrs and Batteries. Makes one sick &amp; tired of the whole show. Anyhow I can see waste time &amp; trouble for nothing. I suppose the Winchester training going to Hell now. Gen Sir John French visited this camp today. Received first letter from my father &amp; sister since arriving in England. Answered their letters also Lauries &amp;Wyns. 
 13th Sept 1916 Early morning jerk on hill. Went up &amp; had a good close glimpse at aeroplane on the ground. Signalling test morning. Signalling reading afternoon. Marched with the 7th down to camp 14 to hear lecture from some old [indecipherable] in the Salvation Army a colonel I think. Gave us a [indecipherable]. While we were lined up ready to be marched over an aviator in a small plane gave us a bonser exhibition of flying. Very exciting. 
 14th Sept 1916 Signalling &amp; out on Battery work. Walked down to camp 10 to find Perce. He was out at Amesbury on Picquet.
