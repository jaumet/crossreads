  
 For five days there was practically no sleep & all ranks again showed their cheerfulness & fighting spirit & the greatest endurance. Again the nature of the country was all against mounted men destroying their mobility.  (The above report is taken almost verbatim from Col Cameron's despatch) 
 On the morning the Bgde area was visited by 6 enemy planes, which dropped one bomb amongst a troop of the 7th L.H. killing 8 men & wounding 10 No casualties in the 5th Regt. On May 12th changed our camp to the Nth of Jericho, weather extremely hot, & wind blowing dense clouds of dust. Whilst here the Regt was attached to the Australian Division furnishing working parties for roadmaking. On May 22nd the 2nd Bgde took over a section of outpost line in the Wadi Auja (No4 Sub-section). This sector was held by each Regt alternately: Two Sqdns holding the outpost line with one in reserve. Daily patrols were made to Tel-el-Truny, where the Turks had an outpost in the foothills. On the 25th Inst our Patrol was fired on & one man killed. Working parties from each Regt were sent out roadmaking & wiring round the constructed positions
