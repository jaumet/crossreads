21.5.15Turks have been very silent with their artillery & only an occasional shot fired from them.  The Turks have been sniping down the valley all day & succeeded in wounding several.  Jack Johnson apparently has been silenced as we have not been molested by him lately, it is rumored that he was located behind the Turks hospital & we gave the Turks 4 hours to get their wounded away, probably the warships blew him up.  D Troop are in the trenches as supports to-night & the remainder of us are sleeping in our "dug-outs".  Stan & I have still bad colds still, but are gradually getting rid of them.
