<p>Monday March 19th<br/>It was exceptionally windy today. French women come for washing &amp; I believe they do it very cheap too. Went into <strike>Boulogne</strike> Wimereaux this afternoon, things were very quiet. Played cards before I went out. Wimereaux is about a mile or so from here, in the opposite direction to Boulogne. The tram runs right into the town. It is a fairly large place &amp; pretty lively.</p>
<p>Tuesday March 20th<br/>A very fine day. They are apparently going to put plants in, all through the camp, as every spare patch is dug up. I have received my mail as regular as could be expected lately. Not feeling too good today. Still living on soft food &amp; chicken.</p>
<p>Wednesday March 21st<br/>Very cold all day, snowed slightly during the morning, but owing to the ground being so warm it soon melted. The water was turned on all through the camp this afternoon, my word it is going to save us a lot of trouble carrying it. Shrubs were planted in previously prepared places about the camp today.</p>
<p>Thursday March 22nd<br/>Snowing, hailing &amp; raining today, at times the ground would be white, while half an hour afterwards it would be muddy. We are not receiving many patients in here now. We have only nine in the ward. The leave (to England) list was published today. I am the 48th on it, all going well I will have my leave within two months.</p>
