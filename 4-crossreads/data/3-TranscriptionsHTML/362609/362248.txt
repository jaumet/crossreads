<p>Tuesday 28th March 1916<br/>The previous night I had received word that I was one of those detailed to return to Aerodrome Camp from Kasr-el-Nil barracks in order to proceed to Alexandria for embarkation on the "Transylvania". Was glad I had spent the previous night packing as it only meant a couple of hours extra work to complete it and have it ready for any eventuality, whether taking the whole of it on or leaving the heavy trunk at Cook's and taking only the sleeping bag and kit bag. Left the orderly to hire a donkey cart and take it back to camp while I went round to the Pension  Wales to spend as much time as possible with Oll: she got rather a shock at the news but took it splendidly alth'o  it meant that she would be left "on her own" in a strange land. We went round to Groppi's for an ice cream, bought some lunch there and then took a garry out to Ghezireh gardens. It was quite a hot day but the drive round the gardens along the bank of the Nile was quite interesting. The gardens are situated on and island formed by a branching of the Nile which at this point is about &frac14; mile across, and being so well watered it is exceedingly fertile.<br/>A large steel bridge having two huge lions at each end joins it to the mainland next to; Kasr-el-Nil barracks while &frac34; of a mile to north and south are two other large bridges. Spanning the busy waterway at the back of the island of the island where the untidy looking masts and spars of the Egyptian boats showed that a small fleet was waiting for the bridge to open, it is another solid steel bridge. Here and there on the island are clusters of date palms which at the time were about to burst into flower, the lower green vegetation of bushes and shrubs being thrown into strong contrast by gorgeous masses of rich bougainvillea. In one or two places large masses of it were growing around the base of a palm tree, giving a very picturesque appearance.<br/>In the gardens were beds of verbenas, petunias, phlox, drummonde, dianthus, salvias, antirrhinums and other annuals showily massed. Fair roses were seen in some of the beds, the whole of which are irrigated with Nile water from time to time. The lawns were well grassed and walks nicely kept. We found a nice shady spot near an irregular patch of straggling apricot trees and had lunch sitting on the grass while a number of Egyptian boys played a sort of football, using a hard cloth ball for the purpose. Stayed until abt. 3o'clock, Oll being interested in the few photos I had brought in my pocket book as reminders of the good old days.<br/>Drove back to the pension where Oll half expected to find a cable from Rid. Said good- bye there and caught the Heliopolis tram back to camp, noting on route that most of the barley crops to be seen along the way had matured wonderfully during the ten days absence, being in many cases a vigorous growth that it was rather badly layered. On arrival at Aerodrome found that the camp was quite in a state of upset since all but perhaps ten or twelve officers and men were to move out that night. Had dinner in the mess and fell in at 6o'clock, finding then</p>
