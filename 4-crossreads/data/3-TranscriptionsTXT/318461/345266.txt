 Sunday 13/5/17. Another exciting night again but not so full of danger as privously, got over for the Rations earlier so could see where we were going &amp; it's the better Plan.

Got here Norreil at about 11.30. &amp; the shells were bursting all round this place owing to Batteries being near. What a  night it was I have had my fill &amp; wish I was out of it, have had 6 days &amp; nights
