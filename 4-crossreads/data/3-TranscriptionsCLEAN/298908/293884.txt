They were all happy & merry as larks till I sprung this thunderbolt on them but for the rest of the afternoon the hut was sad & gloomy till just before tea they started to sneak up to the Orderly Room to see if they could see the list.  After about 6 or so had been up the officer thought there was something wrong & smelt a rat so he told one of the boys that the revised roll had not come down from London yet.  Oh what a relief it was to them when they heard this, & what a reception I got when I came in.  They had arranged a drum head Court Martial for me & I was sentenced to 6 months in a Cook shop with a muzzle on & some other awful punishments, but they reckoned I had carried the thing out so well & taken them in so completely that they would wash all my sentences out on condition that I should never give them such another fright, but I guess they will take some catching next time with a yarn like this, but what a success it was, put the wind up them completely.
