<p>I had put my boots &amp; leggings on for a fortnight. I was slipping all over the wet deck &amp; down the stairs. If you slip on the stairs you go right to the bottom because the boat is generally rolling that way.</p>
<p>I had a very lazy afternoon &amp; at night we all went to the sacred concert in F Ward. There were only a few of the Nurses &amp; Doctors &amp; Capt Moreau sang a very good song.</p>
<p>We have had a very strong N.E. breeze for the last few days &amp; I can tell you that you have to tuck your blankets round you at night.</p>
<p>Monday 17.1.16 (26)<br/>Took the job of cleaning knives &amp; forks to-day. I miss a parade</p>
