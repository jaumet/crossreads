Xmas
My Dear Mother
At last we are afloat good luck to it I am not sorry. we drew out from Port Melbourne Monday evening are steaming slowly to an unknown port which we will reach so I am told some time tomorrow night. we are on a beautiful ship are having a splendid time have experienced none of the horrors of the trooper that we have all read about so much. very few of the lads are sick the tucker is good. we sleep in hammocks which are rather comfortable. we the 1st of the 1st 80 of us are quartered righ forward under the forecastle it's a good place as we feel no vibration off the machinery. When we left Vic it was raining very miserable we shipped from Broadmeadows in the wet mud things were then only looking middling but they are ok now. we have seen nothing since we left save a few porpoises an albatross which has followed us along. I don't think we are travelling the usual route but am not in apposition to say for certain. I must go back now to where I left off at Broadmeadows I got my teeth, al right after much bother. Went into town again on the sunday before we left the boys were having a bit of a riot mounted troopers where having an unpleasant time I don't know for certain what the row was about it was said that a bugler of the 13Batt had been kicked to death or had died from the result of a good kicking received while in little Bourke st. not one of Melbourne's most fashionable streets not one of the best a lot of chows lived there. Although I enjoyed the fun I was sorry for the pals for no doubt the boys where in the wrong. all the windows were smashed a couple of chines injured had it been any night but sunday plenty blood would have been spilt some of the chaps are not capable of thought when they are stirred up. We are going dead slow I suppose the other troopers will catch us up somewhere
Much love to all from

address the same

We are told not to give the name of the boat 
seems a lot of tommy rot to most of us
