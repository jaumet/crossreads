  Written after leaving Anzac  
 After a beautiful sleep in our blankets I have a busy time issuing rations   &amp;  attending to a whole lot of little details At 2 pm   me  we move up into the firing line  &amp;  see the bombardment which tears the Turk trenches about a lot At 3 pm we start to get out of the trench into a bit of a valley out of sight of the Turks but some of us were not lucky enough to get down quick enough I got my first hit in the left foot about 1 minute after getting out of our trench

 My experience for the next few seconds trying to regain our trench w/- rifles   &amp;  M G's playing all around was a thing not to be forgotten in a day.
