1918Sun. 17th Feb. (cont.)We passed a number of islands.   Shortly after dark we anchored;  a vessel close by morsed some messages across and the ship settled down for the night.
Mon. 18th Feb,The anchorage in which we are now lying is just outside the entrance to Flensburg.
We are right in the channel - the two small cruisers guarding the entrance are off each beam.   At about nine am the appearance of a homeward-bound submarine brought us all to the deck.
She passed us with the crew on deck cheering madly.
The cruiser on our port-beam circled round us soon afterwards, her crew manning the decks and rigging and cheering us (or rather our captors.)   A huge Ensign now flies from our stern and we are evidently regarded as of great interest by the crews of the few little coasters coming in and out of the port.
