Saturday 6 May 1916A fairly fine day, one or two light showers falling. Re-reading letters, censoring &c. during the morning & in the afternoon watched a football match, 14/2 V 12/2 resulting in my company being beaten by 6 to 3. In the evening went into Etaples with Prescott & several others to a little dinner. Coming home at 10 o'c we saw lights above the clouds in two places, in all probability Zeppelins. One appeared to be over Boulogne & the other S of Etaples. Later on in the night while lying awake I thought I heard one or two explosions.A "Methodist" (E.H.) & pair of socks (W.E.C.) had come to hand during my absence.
