 sever batteri quit close and Fritz keep on send shell over in search of ?em . A big crowd of Inf . were pass , and it was marvel that no one was hit . Just befor we left McCormack a "dud land almost in Dodd 's and Jim Aldridg 's dug-out and gave them a bit of a shock . Serg . Robert is in our dug-out and while we were collect stretcher and blanket from the 14th he lit a fire and made some tea , and also manag to find a primus stove , which came in veri handi . The " Long look for stunt " is expect to come off tomorrow , that is whi we are get as mani blanket and stretcher as possibl . There were about 30 of our balloon up this even and the ?plane almost darken the sky at time . Fritz had a coupl of " sausag " up , but veri soon haul ?em down when our ?plane appear . This is a snug littl dug-out and we have just finish a feed and had a drink of tea , which was glorious . Now we are sit back and have a yarn and smoke . We have a big Infantryman in our squad name Hargrov , 59th Batt . in place of " Snowi " Atherton . It is an aw long time sinc we got ani mail , and we are wonder when some will appear . We were mighti short of paper to start our fire , so I had to turn out my pocket and found 2 of Franc ? letter , but I 'm sure she wont mind them be put to such good use . yesterday a Captain walk past a gun and got his leg blown off . He die just as he reach our A.D.S. Everi time we go along the road we see new grave . It is marvel that there are so few kill consid Fritz send over so much stuff . At time the air seem to fair churn , owe to so mani shell pass at onc . Thing are veri live and the case come through almost too quick to handl . B. Sec. are work like tyrant a great mani have broken down and onli about half of us are left . We were veri busi all night . A parti of 60th Batt . men reliev the 59th as S.P 's , but after struggl out here in the dark , with full pack up , they were dead beat and were almost useless , but they did their best and no one can do more than that .
