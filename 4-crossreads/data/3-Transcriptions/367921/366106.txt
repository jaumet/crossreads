<p>On this occasion we travelled with our sentry in a special compartment set aside for dogs, and over the journey had much pleasure in opening up some of our English foodstuffs under the eyes of the sentry and two civilians who had just partaken of their  "snack" of a couple of dry (paper thickness) slices of German bread - it certainly gave us pleasure to see their envious eyes compelled to turn away.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hours train journey brought us to our home town and we arrived about tea time to receive a great reception from the Englishmen of the party who came to our assistance with gifts of food and clothing that kept us going until our parcels started coming to hand.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our reception from the sentries was somewhat strained and we were alloted to rooms higher up in the building that would offer us greater obstacles by way of escaping.
