<p>going to hold a few Court Martials  -  Time was passing so we 4 left for the Boat  -  We found a short cut &amp; then &ndash; when back in town &ndash; decided to call on the officer's (military) club  -  The Submarines are a thirsty cunning crowd &amp; what they don't &amp; wont do isn't worth worrying over  -  We called &amp; asked for a chap who we didn't suspect of being there &ndash; but he might have been  -  He wasn't &ndash; but some officer asked us to have a drink  -  He was a colonel &amp; then there was another chap Maning &ndash; I'd been introduced to his brother the day before &amp; mentioned the fact  -  Patterson sat next the colonel &amp; talked in his usual fluent manner with any amount of submarine bad language &ndash; as if he &amp; the colonel were twins - I must say this &ndash; the colonel didn't turn a hair &ndash; He hadn't much  -  Well we had drinks &amp; after a bit as I was the Senior I thanked the Colonel &amp; said we must get on board  -  This mess is at the German Club &amp; a very fine building</p>
