 Dear Vernon, 
 In going through some old files of mine I came across the attached notes issued to the Battery Commanders of my old command, & have sent a copy on to you hoping they be of possible assistance should you or your Section Commanders have the opportunity or need for a quiet "talk" to your young officers. 
 Yours sincerely, W.L.H. Burgess. 
 (Lt. Morris File herewith also.) WLHB

Birdwood in a letter dated 17 March 1919, as being of "exceptional ability and character."]
