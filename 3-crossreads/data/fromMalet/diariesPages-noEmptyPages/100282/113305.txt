Fritz dropped a large number of bombs round some of our batteries this afternoon I don't know what damage they done tonight they are at it again.
29th Great activity in the air again this morning for it is a nice day plenty of sun for a wonder.
The lesson of yesterday seems to have been forgotten for all the men were out drilling again, just advertising themselves. A big Australian mail came in last night but I got nothing out of it, all gone to England again I suppose.
The Huns have been using a lot of our guns ammunition against us, they captured them from the Russians, from what I can hear our shells are far worse than the German ones, hurts I can tell you to have your own stuff shot back at you.
30th There was a regular raid on last night, Fritz must have dropped some hundreds of bombs, big ones at that, for they shook the ground for miles around he kept it up nearly all night long
