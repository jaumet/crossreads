Similar fate to day. The Brigade Signalling Officer Lieut Smith was not killed after all but wounded. The other officer in the tent was killed and a third was wounded. The safest plan on such occasions is to drop flat on the ground thus minimizing the chance of being struck by flying fragments.

We buried 9 men including two one officers yesterday evening and the Camels were yoked to all the dead horses(27 in all) and taken away and buried So the man bird succeeded in getting 9 men killed and about 5 men wounded  27 horses killed and 10 horses wounded with one out of the 8 bombs he aimed at us. No details as to how other units suffered "Pharoah" came home this morning looking quite well and in good Condition after his mad escapade I was quite pleased to see him back again Signaller Boyer transferred from the 3rd Light horse to us today That makes one over strength but it does not matter we shall require them all.
