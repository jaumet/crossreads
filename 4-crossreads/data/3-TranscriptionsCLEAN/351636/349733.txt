The Centre for Soldiers Wives & Mothers -
Dear Mr. Horsfield -The bearer Mrs. Andrews says she wants to go back to Queensland where she has been promised work. She belongs to Queensland I understand and you have been helping her since she came here. I am not sure if you will help under the circumstances as she should really not be under our Funds. She came down when her husband went into camp.
Yours faithfullyB Booth -
