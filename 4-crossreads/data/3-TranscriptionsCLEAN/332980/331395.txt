  
 not Stop until Kings Cross station in London was reached at 7.30 am 15" late, the Run from Edinburgh was very comfortable & the Scenery from both Sides was very interesting, the Train took 10 hours to do the distance of about 400 miles which was a 40 miles per hour average including stops, & at times we were going some, flying through stations that fast I could not read the names of them, I took the Tube Railway from King's Cross to Waterloo where I went over to the Club, (Union Jack) where I had a Wash & Brush up & had Breakfast & booked my Bed for the Night, After a good Breakfast I walked over the Waterloo Bridge where I took a Tram which runs alongside of the Embankment & out to East Hill about 3 miles away, the Tram runs alongside of the Embankment & over Westminister Bridge & along the other Side of the River & through several streets to East Hill, & then it returns & I came back with it to London Bridge passing again over Westminister Bridge & along the Embankment to the Terminus, London Bridge where I left the Tram & inquired my way to Whitechapel where I wish to visit Petticoat Lane on a Sunday Morn
