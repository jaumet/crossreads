  
 sure whether we were going to Quarantine or not. Our hopes were dashed to the Ground when we turned in towards Manly. A New Zealand Boat & the "Sonoma" were anchored in Quarantine & as we passed they gave us a hearty cheer, the only sign of a welcome Home we have received so far. one chap on the "Sonoma" played a number of Patriotic Airs on a Cornet, which sounded real good across the water. A number of Manly Boats passed us & gave us a welcome with their Handkerchiefs I looked thro' "Gib" Telescope to see if I pick Lill out, but even had she been on one, the Boat was too far away for us to distinguish anyone. They took us ashore in Launches.  Our Bags were carted up to the Camp on G.S. Waggons, & we had to climb up the Hill to the top of North Head, where our camp is. 6 of us to a Tent. It was a wild scramble to draw Blankets & eating utensils, & everybody was in a Bad Humour. After a feed of Bread & Jam, Gib & I turned in between our Blankets as we were knocked out with the Day's excitement.
