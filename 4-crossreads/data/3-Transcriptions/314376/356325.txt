<p>14.<br/>prior to sailing was a well remembered one to me. We left Liverpool at 4/30 amidst the cock a doodle doing of the trams that were drawn up at the station. Reached Sydney and I remember that it rained pretty heavily. The lines were constantly broken by the relatives of the soldiers coming in and talking to them.</p>
<p>I remember seeing Douglas Graham with a girl on his arm. He was afterwards, so I was told, killed at Strazcele [France]. The circumstances were pathetic as his case. One of a party of No 7 Platoon of which he was a corporal, told off to storm a farm house in which German machine gunners were poseted, he got badly wounded. He was seen waving his hands all through the day. Towards night he ceased &ndash; dead.</p>
<p>We put up for the night at the Show Ground, we who are able secured leave so that we might say a final</p>
