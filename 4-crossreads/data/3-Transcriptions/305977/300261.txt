<p>&amp; after dark we began to throw them &amp; kept it up at regular intervals all night.  In our sap alone we threw over 200 bombs.  Another chap in the 5th LH got hit, but not very badly.  We got several bombs well in to the Turks trenches.  George Steggles came round during the day &amp; I had a yarn with him for some time.  He doesn't care too much for Gallipoli, but then who does!</p>
<p>Monday 6th [Sept]<br/>Came off duty at 5 am &amp; got a couple of hours sleep in.  Saw a Queenslander from the observation post shoot a Turk who was in a trench on the left which this post commands.  Another Turk came in to help his comrade out, but the Queenslander wouldn't shoot him.  We were relieved at 10 am by some men of our Brigade.  Reported back to the Regt at 11.  Some of the 6th Infantry Brigade arrived yesterday</p>
