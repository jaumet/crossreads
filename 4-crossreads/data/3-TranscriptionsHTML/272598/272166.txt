<p>Le Transloy a little further on.  Got ducked coming home</p>
<p>Sunday 1.4.17<br/>No rations; a bit of a strain.  Walked to the Butte-de-Walencourt, a strong position Fritz once held &amp; was so troublesome to our lads; has surely been peppered by our artillery.  Cost a lot of men to take it.  Went by Albert-Bapaume road &amp; returned across country through Le-Barque &amp; Ligne-Thilloy.<br/>Fritz brought down one of our observation baloons in flames this morning.  No men allowed to sleep in cellars till further notice.</p>
<p>Monday 2.4.17<br/>Village of Doignies taken by 55th &amp; 56 Btns, but they suffered fairly heavily in doing so.  In consequence</p>
