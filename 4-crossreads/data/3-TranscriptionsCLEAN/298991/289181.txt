  
 Tuesday June 19th This camp will do me, they have a fairly decent lot of Officers & N.C.O's here now. Went up for reclassification this morning & was marked B1 A, so that means I will be here for a while yet, of course I had to put in a few "good ones" to get as low as that. We get very good food here. The chaps who have been here for a while says there was a riot over the food about three weeks ago, & from that day things have altered considerably. Went for a bit of a route march & lecture this afternoon. They do not so much drill here, & then it is all stretcher drill. 
 I have met a good few fellows I know, including some who were here this time last year. Some of the "staff" are still here, perhaps they may find out some day there is actually a war on. Went to a concert in the Church of England this evening. It was a London troupe & not up to much, of course some of the items were good &  some  very crook, nerve racking to Listen to. 
 Wednesday June 20th A big draft picked to go to France today, there are only about 30 "neutrals" left now. We have to take our blankets out  every  on early morning parade every morning to air them, & a very good idea too! Had a tooth filled this afternoon & it aching " some " now, of course it was filled in military style. Very windy all day. Rained this evening. We have a very good & sociable mob in our hut.
