<p>I have been round the country which is gorgeous just now, the flowers are gorgeous.  The other morning I got up very early &amp; had a cycle ride to a certain historical place &amp; rode miles through a wood &amp; stacks of honeysuckle bushes loaded with blossom fairly made the air like a scent factory.</p>
<p>I suppose you know Bert Macnamara has been wounded, he will lose one eye, a jolly pity.  Bill Barlow was killed.  I got a rotten shock &amp; am very sorry indeed.</p>
<p>I wonder what you are doing &amp; how you are getting on &amp; whether it is cold, or wet at Tog this winter.  And how is Graham &amp; the Boss &amp; Mac &amp; who are the Jackeroos &amp; what are they like.</p>
<p>I wish I could get a letter, its so maddening as I know you write.  I'm full of the war &amp; no error.  I'm wearing my glasses today, first time for years but my eyes &amp; head have been bad lately.  Haven't heard from Mrs. Johnson or Miss Arn lately.</p>
<p>Blowing a gale today, I'm going to town tomorrow to hear the Garde Republicaire Band play &amp; am gloating over the prospect.</p>
