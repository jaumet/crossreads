18/12/18 Solre-St-Gery - Barbencon
here on a good many of the signs were marked in French & Flemish. Just before coming to a fine large leafless forest we came upon a perfectly good 77mm gun left by the roadside. It bore a legend that it was captured at 11 am 11/11/18 and marked the furthest limit of English advance by fighting. We wound our way into the poor village of Solre St Gery and then across pretty country to Barbencon. In all today's march was about 11 miles. Soon settled in billets. Cleaner houses and cleaner kitchen utensils show we are among the Belges. The people look & speak different to the French. One feels their hatred of the Germans is only lukewarm. After mess enjoyed the "Times" and then returned to billet and yarned in living room with the hard working people. On their own admission they own 80 acres @ Â£120 per acre.
