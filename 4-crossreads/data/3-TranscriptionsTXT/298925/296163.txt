28th  Field Firing at Beach's Barn.  Brigade marched through Netheravon, still another village, 5 miles from Camp.  It is a superior village to most of the others, but still &ndash; a village! 3 miles farther on we came to Beach's Barn where we (the band) lay down watching the aeroplanes.  We saw some very fine flying, looping the loop, spiral descents, wheeling etc.  The bristol Scouts are absolutely marvelous.  When turning the stand on their end.  We returned at 5.30.
