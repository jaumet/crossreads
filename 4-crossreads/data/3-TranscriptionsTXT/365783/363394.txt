have accepted.  It was lovely to get all your chatty information regarding the youngsters - I was greatly amused at some of their doings & sayings.   Peter seems to have been a great little man - what a sweet little kid he must be.    How I do wish I could see you all.    The children here remind me of my own but only because they are young & have young voices - they are a filthy dirty lot - I refer of course to the natives.   I was sorry to hear of Margaret's sickness at the beginning of the voyage, apparently she wasn't very bad but I know exactly how anxious you would have been.   What a hustle you must have been in just before leaving Sydney - you had to do everything yourself of course.   Fancy the Neitenstein's talking of building - I was sorry to hear that the Wurley had not been taken by Arch or the Garlands - the Neits. will I'm sure take great care of the place; but I'm afraid they will always be wanting to get back to their beloved Burwood.  It was grand to get new of how things were in the garden - your description of Xmas bushes, arches, rockeries etc brought the whole thing very vividly before me.   Arch Westland, the same to day etc & the infinite trouble he takes to store up some infernal old weed & the triumphal burrowing of the same to the one that knows salt from mustard.
