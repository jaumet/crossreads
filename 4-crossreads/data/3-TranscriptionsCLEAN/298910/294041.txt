The Germans shot at the bearers as they were getting back over the parapet. Heavy bombardment all night, also heavy rifle & machine gun fire. 
 23/7/16  Sunday 
 Fritz was busy exchanging big uns all day - Got a kick last night about 1 am as a gas attack was on, but it turned out to be smoke. Only the remnants of the 5th Division holding these lines today. We hear good news of a big advance further along the line ( Pozierres ), no doubt although our casualties were heavy, we have served the purpose of holding a big lot of Boshs  here P. Guards thus allowing them Lower down to advance - Poor Tom Dawson who once made Australia laugh at his jokes - bled to death on no mans land. We got a Circular from G.O.C. & A.D.M.S. complimenting us on our very fine work. Aeroplanes busy - also rifles, Trench mortars & machine guns. We are not far from V.C. Avenue, it was here where M. O'Leary won his V.C. Other names of trenches & saps
