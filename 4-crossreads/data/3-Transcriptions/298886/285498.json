<p>not seeing me for their mail . I always notice that those who wail the loudest invarably get no letters. They squeal like little stuck pigs when they cant get access to those bags. Oh! that infernal mail! I wish it in Hell &ndash; but I cannot get rid of the job at no cost I cant give it away.</p>
<p>The Armourer Sergeant gets worried out of his life about that mail He generally stops in the tent repairing rifles most times and whereas I am generally out They come to the door of the tent all during the heat of the afternoon when I am generally lying under the palms having a read or a sleep. If he happens to be lying down in the tent having a read or even sleeping they generally continue to wake him up and say "Is the Signalling Sergeant In?" No! says Kirk "Is there any mail in? "Don't know" again says Kirk. The dialogue generally ends by Kirk telling them to go - somewhere  That's why I get away from the tent as often as I get the chance. Hence Kirk's annoyance. If they don't want me they generally want Ferguson the Trumpeter Sergeant.</p>
