<p>June 22nd<br/>Went out in a road reconnaisence today along the Hamadan Road.  Took Sgts. Place &amp; Cameron.  Capt. Nicol (NZ) on another similar job with a couple of Sgts.  We did about 10 miles of road by taking compass bearings &amp; rough notes which I compiled into a sketch on return to camp.  Mules provided for mounts.  We rigged up stirrups with rope &amp; the big saddles proved rather comfortable.</p>
