  
 no more pleased man in this Camp tonight than he is now I am back & am taking it over in the morning, it takes him exactly 4 1/2 hours to do what I put over in 2 hours but of course I have got the run of the ropes & that's a big thing in such a complicated job.  It is raining heavily tonight I have been expecting this for it has been very close & muggy all day. & rain is quite a common thing in England. 19th.  Took over the dental work again this morning much to the relief of all concerned. Got quite a batch of letters today from various correspondents. 20th.  Rather funny on parade this morning I had not quite finished calling my roll when an officer came down & started to march the whole show away
