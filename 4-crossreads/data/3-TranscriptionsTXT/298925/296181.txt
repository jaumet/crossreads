 ext. "Prof Beauty" 
 Thinkest thou there are no serpents in the world But those that glide along the grassy sod And sting the luckless foot that presses them? There are those in the path of social life Do bask their spotted skins in fortune's sun And slay the soul. 
 I see thou has't pass'd sentence on my heart And I'll no longer weep nor plead against it But with the humblest most obedient patience Meet thy dear hands, and kiss them when they wound me.
