<p>Longueval, Delville Wood &amp; Battle front 6/11/16 Saved an altogether sleepless night by Hunt arriving with some coats and a blanket.  Up and away with Thwaites to the trenches passing through the muddy remnants of Longueval.  Piles of shells standing by the roadside and great activity in Delville Wood where the rows of big guns were very impressive. In the ruins of the trees crowds of men were working on trenches and other constructional work.  Outside the wood we cut across country which was being shelled intermittently and was almost devoid of grass being just one clayey plain full of shell holes.  Lines of batteries of light guns belching out.  Passed many little bumps of field grey sticking out of the mud.  In one place a couple of jaws full of teeth were all that remained of a face.  Somewhere else a pair of boots encircling hose "a world too wise for their shrunk shanks" and withal a stink.  Many graves under water.  Saw our shells bursting all over German lines and got into our trenches and had lunch with CO.  Took a good look through a telescope at Bapaume and saw the clock faces of the Town Hall.  Returned via the wood and came back into camp.  Hunt had made things very comfortable and Bazeley came along during the evening.  A very clear sunset and crowds of observation balloons up all on one sector.  Big guns putting over shells occasionally with deep booms and echo. A clear calm quiet night.  It was piercingly cold and I was sleeping on a bed &amp; stretcher raised upon two boxes.  This proved unfortunate as the cold cut up underneath and rendered sleep nearly impossible.  A troubled slumber.  Some very big guns kept firing and their concussion shook the  [indecipherable] tent 6 inches at times.  Heavy cannonades.</p>
