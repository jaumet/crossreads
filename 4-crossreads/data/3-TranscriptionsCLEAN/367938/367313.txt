myself as the rumours are busy as usual. I know this morning I saw some neatly dressed men bobbing up & down like balls on a fountain, so can tell they are coming in.
I have had a mail from you, Con & Mother dated Ap. 13th & a Sunday Times wh is much in request from the others for the latest [weights?] & times - The life & descriptions of dresses appear very paltry to us here. Letters are nice & eagerly looked for - We know there are some more kicking round but they take a long time to get here.
Please thank Con for the letter - the name - the regiment & M.E.F. is sufficient address. I only have 7 or 8 envelopes left so cannot expect to do nearly the amt. of writing I intended to. Next week will be too full of watching to do any writing.
Impossible to write to the people who ask me to especially girls who have asked for a line from the front. Am I to write about the headless Turks carried out or the flora & fauna visible from this cave. There are no trees - low bushes only & a yellow broom-like scrub - ants & snakes - two kinds I have seen - Water is difficult to procure - no washing allowed of course.
