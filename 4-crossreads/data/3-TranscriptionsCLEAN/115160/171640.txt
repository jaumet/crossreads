 I was very pleased to get word of the draft you sent. When I landed in France I had half-a-franc in my pocket. That trip to Scotland took all the wind out of my sails. But I am now on my feet again.  All the same, the money will be handy to draw upon if I want it.  I will try and get you some hand-made lace and a few other things and send them on. I see that another mailboat - the Mooltan - has gone down with mails dated 31st May to 10th June.  
 I see Bess is keeping you well supplied with new dogs. Has she dug up any cats too? How is poor old cookie? I'm glad to see she's getting on so well at the hall.  It's better than juggling plates, eh? 
 I got Dad's letter of 29th May too.  I'm glad he is well, although there was not much doing at work.  I suppose the garden is still in first class condition.  And the windows and bath too! I hope you haven't scrapped everything out of my room.  By the bye, did you get a wee short note through Auntie Maggie? This is Wallace's birthday, isn't it? 
 I'll ring off now.  I may be writing in a day or so again. So now, "Rachael", look after yourself, ye ken, and I will too.  Many loving wishes to you, and Dad, and Bess and Lockhart.  I wish I could shout you a few bottles of champagne. 
 Fondest love and kisses xxxxxxxxxx 
 Your loving son, 
 James
