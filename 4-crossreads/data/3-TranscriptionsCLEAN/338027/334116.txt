  
 Friday, 8 January, 1915 Whilst galloping his horse this morning one of our officers Capt Ramsden met with what may have been a nasty accident.  His horse stumbled & fell heavily breaking its neck & dying instantly.  We extricated the Capt immediately. 
 We received a lot of mail from Aust to-day but it was all Dec. 10th so consequently there are three months gone astray.  I rec. two letters but not the ones I wanted one tells me that my brother Harold has joined the force.  He is in camp at Broadmeadows.  A paper came to hand with the report of a divorce case in which our Colonel was co-resp.  The scandal caused much amusement. 
 Saturday, 9 January, 1915 Melb. papers are greatly appreciated by the men, apparently things are very bad over there at present.  Recruiting is being carried on briskly so our reinforcement must be near Alexandria now. 
 All the N. Zealanders paraded to-day before Sir Thomas Mackenzie at Gezira & he delivered a stirring address to them. 
 There are a few black sheep Australians who have been playing up in Cairo and consequently get the Aust. a bad name. 
 Saturday afternoon is now a half-holiday which is needless to say very popular.
