 On exhibition work. 
 During my visit to Palestine affairs have been frightfully muddled. Pictures were made from wretched subjects indiscriminately and without consideration to size. The result has been a waste of time endeavouring to make pictures fit. Double the amount of work has therefore been thrust on me. 
 17th  Today I received a batch of Color  reproductions from the Paget Plate Coy. The Palestine results are far beyond my expectations. The colors such as one only sees in Palestine have been rendered perfectly and should be one of the main features of the exhibition.
