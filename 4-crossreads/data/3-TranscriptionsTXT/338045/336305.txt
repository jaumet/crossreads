 1916 30th Sept. - Saturday Raining again this morning &amp; cold all day.  Rain cleared off in the afternoon.  In accordance with our appointment with the Belge, take the train to Bonsecours at 3 p.m., but after waiting for half an hour &amp; he had not arrived, we came to the conclusion that he must have been despatched on duty &amp; make off.  As usual I start buying some souvenirs which may be overdone, as spend my money.  A cup of tea &amp; some cakes at our usual caf&eacute; &amp; return.  A walk around the town until 8-30 p.m. &amp;
