I spent some time trying to learn Arabic but the inter-rupter went and got sick and has gone to hospital. it is great to hear of selling so many rams this year, and I suppose it will go on increasing every year now, and no doubt having James' will help greatly to get ahead of it - being able to run so many more sheep - but I think you are wise Father in getting more land cleared in the back paddock - there is no doubt we must have the improved land to grow the  she   corriedales big and its the studs that are making our name alright - with the wool off the flock sheep. Wish I could get back and on the plough again. I feel good for some hard work after all this loafing over here. i would like to see those two Warrobil paddocks in lucerne and our studs on them - if the govt. do take over Cooyal for returned men, dont loose a chance of hopping me in for those paddocks Father if you see a chance and approve of the idea. Freds crown lease is good scheme now he is able to convert it to CP & CL. Its a pity we could not drop a bomb on Kermonds! But we will get him out of that in time! How many Corriedales has Cousin Jocelyn got?
