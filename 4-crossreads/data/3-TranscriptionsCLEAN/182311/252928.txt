AWARD OF THE MILITARY CROSS TO LIEUT.CHARLES H.PETERS.
38th Battalion, 3rd.Aust.Division.
 
 
   At Armentieres on the night of 31st December 1916 and 1st January 1917 he led a patrol against the enemy trench having reconnoitered personally the lines of advance on two previous nights.  On reaching the enemy's wire, his party was discovered by a search-light and was attacked by machine guns and bombs.  With coolness and skill he extricated his party.  He furnished at the conclusion of the patrol's operation an excellent reconnaissance report.
 
   On the next night he lead a relief party along the German wire to look for some missing men of another patrol.  After methodically searching No Man's Land in the vicinity, in spite of searchlights and machine guns playing on the gap in the enemy wire, he discovered and brought back to our lines one of the missing men who had been wounded the night before and was in a state of complete exhaustion.
