<p>Thursday June 7. 1917. (1039.)<br/>It is hot today.<br/>The bombardment continued last night with great severity, but gradually died away towards morning. It is reported here that the boys went over the top last night, and have taken Messines and advanced past it, taking over 1000 prisoners.<br/>I also heard that the Pioneers are put into the Companies, with the exception of Len Sherman &amp; myself, who are at present with the Transports. Sherman is a saddler. Possibly C. Handcock is still cooking at the I. M. Store. This is not surprising for vacancies in the Pioneers are not being filled, with one exception that of plummers.<br/>The Papers this morning report another air raid on the S. E. of England by 16 raiders. There were 31 victims, two of them being killed. The principal attack was on naval Establishments in the Medway. Two German Aeroplanes were brought down. There was a certain amount of damage done.<br/>There has been a chapter of accidents in the transports to day. When we were getting our dinner to day at the cook House a stray bullet shot Waxey Campbell through the head  He dropped like a stone. I was only a few feet way &amp; saw him fall &amp; heard the smack. He never spoke &amp; bled profusely. I helped to carry him on to a stretcher. He was put in a motor car and taken to the hospital</p>
