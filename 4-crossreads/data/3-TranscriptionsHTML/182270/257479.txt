<p>MONDAY, JUNE 16, 1919.</p>
<p>Fine with westerly wind blowing</p>
<p>all day.</p>
<p>Peter &amp; I took the cows</p>
<p>&amp; calves out of the Strand &amp; put</p>
<p>them in the Hill. Went down</p>
<p>and tailed the Point lambs in</p>
<p>afternoon. There were only 40 lambs</p>
<p>about 11%.</p>
