Thursday 27 September 1917.
On watering parade to the Waddi 6 miles out. Since my last visit, things have changed wonderfully. "The line of communication" is altogetlher improved in every way. Telegraph lines, entrenched roads etc. form a great change & addition to the defences. There are now thousands of troops on the Waddi in expectation of the "big push" shortly.
Artillery covered by battle aeroplanes was seen moving out towards flank of Beersheebah Beersheba.
