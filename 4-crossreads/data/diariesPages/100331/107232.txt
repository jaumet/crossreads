ahead of me, it was a Fritz High Explosive. The shell struck the Road fair in the Centre blew up the Cobble stones in the Air, I took cover at once behind a Tree the stones were falling around me everywhere, nobody got hurt, the Explosion was about 15 ft from a Belgian's Home some of the stones broke the slates on the Roof. I went along towards my Eng when another shell exploded at the side of me about 30 yds away just about 15 ft from our Coal stage between the lines it made a hole about 6 ft deep about 15 ft across. The dirt shot up in the Air a number of Chinaman were coaling an Engine they ran in all directions for cover the dirt fell all over them, a few minutes another one came over struck the Bank alongside of the Low Road blew the dirt all over our Cook House which was about 20 ft away, the Roof was covered with Sand the Officers Breakfast which was inside was spoilt by the dirt,
