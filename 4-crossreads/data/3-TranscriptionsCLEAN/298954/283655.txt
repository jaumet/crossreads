  
 Brandenburg camp contains many thousands of Russians, mostly filthy, ignorant peasants.   The poor devils are mostly of magnificent physique and are drafted in and out of the camp in slave-like labour gangs, to work for the usual 3d a day.   There are also large batches of French (sailors & soldiers), Italians, Poles, & English all of whom (with the exception of officers and under-officers) are also in the labour gangs.   The only food supplied (it is given to all alike) is coffee substitute at 6 am, a basin of quite indescribable soup at midday, another basin at 6 pm.    A small cube of bread (black & half-sawdust) is supplied in the afternoon.   The manner in which this awful food is served & the odor of the stuff prevent any of us from touching it except as a last resort. 
 We exist on a weekly dole from the British Relief Committee, which is naturally unable to give much in such a place as this.
