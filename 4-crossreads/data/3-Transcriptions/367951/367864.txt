<p>France June 18/1916</p>
<p>Dear Beat &amp; Family<br/>Just a few lines to let you know i am keeping alright hoping to god that you and the children are the same and that little Tom will be alright when i come home i dont think that will be long now. I was nearly called for on Wednesday the 15th June i just shifted my things into a new dug out laid my blanket down and got in to have two hours sleep but i forgot the box that Kate sent over so i went back for it only about twenty yards away and the Germans started to bombard our trenches so i had to lay down where i was and when they finished i went back for my sleep but there was no dug out a shell lobed strait on it and knocked it to pieces you would never know their had been a dug out their i lost all that was in it but i had all of my clothes on and that Green cover Mrs Atkinson made for my head on. I lost a lot of little nick nacks i was keeping to fetch home but they went i will not bother carting things about again. I see according to the papers that Kate sends over the Russians are giving the Australians a prety lively time of it.</p>
