A small diary of my life on Active Service
I enlisted in the A.I.F. on May 3rd 1915, went into the Liverpool training camp, May 5th and found myself placed in NI Coy infantry, I did various drills till May 18th, when I was transferred to the Army Medical Corps, my work there was an orderly in the Sergeants mess, I oftened wondered as I went about my duties whet would I ever get away with a draft or a Unit overseas, everything comes to thoese who wait so on August
