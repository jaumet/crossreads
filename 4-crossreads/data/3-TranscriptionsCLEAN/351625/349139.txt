  
 she had seen us in the tents 10 all together or crowded on the old "Hororato" she would not need ask such questions would she?  Ken & I with the rest of the chaps that went to Duntroon & all the returned soldiers in our company have been put in an advance squad that will jump from the 3rd week of training which the rest of the company is in to the 9th week, & we are getting special attention paid us so as to get us ready for tests in musketry, bombing, bayonet fighting, Lewis machine gun & gas all of which men have to know before going to France, this work is very interesting.

One good thing gas is in no way to be feared at the front now as they have such splendid helmets which men always have to carry in a helmet
