<p>Dear mother,</p>
<p>This is March &amp; it's snowing again.  Six inches fell last night without making any fuss about it at all.  It would be great if we didn't know only too well what the thaw will bring in the way of mess.</p>
<p>It was during the attack on [blank] which fell some months ago.  The wire had been cut by the intensity of the shelling, the fire was too hot for the runners to get back although several had attempted it, &amp; the General commanding was fuming &amp;</p>
