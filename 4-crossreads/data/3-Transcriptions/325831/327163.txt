<p>8.<br/>a bit too healthy just now. Seems as if Austria was trying to make peace with Italy on her own, &amp; Lloyd George gone to Rome to see what was doing. I am afraid that pressure from neutrals, combined with internal rot, will be too strong, &amp; that England will cave in before 12 months. The proposal for peace has had a most disturbing effect &ndash; you know what it is to carry a case while the parties are negotiating for a settlement, particularly when you will miss another brief if the case goes on.</p>
