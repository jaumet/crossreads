<p>were able to spend all the money we wanted to, Tel-el-Kebir is about 2 1/2 hours run in a train from Cairo so men were given leave to visit Cairo for one day in their turn, I received Xmas parcels from Australia here better late than never &amp; I appreciated them very much &amp; shared them with my mates who in turn&nbsp;shared their own with me. I got my days leave to Cairo &amp; went to the pyramids I went right inside to the Queens chamber its fearfully stuffy inside &amp; hardly worth the trip, our stay at Tel-el-Kebir was about a month.
