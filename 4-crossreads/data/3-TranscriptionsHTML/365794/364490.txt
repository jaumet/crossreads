<p>Friday 30 March 1917 [29 March 1918]<br/>After a night of terrific wind one rises to face a khamsein [also spelt khamsin or khamaseen] &amp; swallow sand all day long.  Church 6.30 a.m., then at 11 a.m. we go to the Recreation room &amp; again have a service.<br/>Our Colonel Young is to leave us in a few days.  Whom shall we get in his stead?  Matron away up the line after a week at Alex with hubby.  I hear that the latest scandal of 27th is 1st some dreadful thing done or found in the garden therefore all visitors stopped after 7 p.m.  (2) A sister (?) returns about 12 m.n. &amp; is hardly able to walk as she comes through the gatehouse &ndash; truly this Egypt seems to let all passions loose &amp; one wonders what would happen if we were all kept shut up here with no work for any length of time.</p>
