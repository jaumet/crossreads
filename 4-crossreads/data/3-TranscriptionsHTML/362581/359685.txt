<p>XOXOXO<br/>OXOXOXOXOXO<br/>My darling Eddy,</p>
<p>Wrote a letter to Grin, Mammie   &amp;  Aunts this morning since that a mail has come in, with a letter from Auntie Ethel dated June 25th   &amp;   I'm so delighted at getting it &ndash; also one  from Annie Thomas   &amp;  Counsin Alice.</p>
<p>So glad to hear you have gone to school   &amp;  like it so much, hope you will get on well    &amp;  have good health to help you at your work. It will be my birthday in two days time but not much like it away from home. Hope I get the cake all right. Fondest love   &amp;  kisses From auntie Eadle.</p>
