 May 1917 I went in to Arras, a distance of about 22 Km from here.   Arras is a fine large town, (about twice the size of Albert or Bapaume) and although knocked about terribly is still very picturesque.   showing signs   Most of the large buildings have been destroyed, either partially or totaly.   The cathederal which has been a magnificent building, has very little left.    The   Part of the tower is still standing &amp; we climbed up to the top of it, about 200' high, from where we obtained an uninterupted view for about four miles round.   The town is full of Tommies, but we saw no Australians.   It also has a fairly large population of Civilians for a place so near the lines.
