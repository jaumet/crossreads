<p>Shakespearean actor and organiser of the Festival lately returned from service in France; at tea on Sunday I met him, had a little chat, and heard him deliver &quot;The Song of Agincourt.&quot;&nbsp; Sunday was spent roaming the town and its environs, finding many of the buildings closed, but revisiting them on Monday afternoon.&nbsp; Such few Shakes-pearean relics as remain to us are not gather<sub>^</sub><sup>er</sup> into one Museum, but distributed amongst the various buildings restored and preserved in the style of Shapespeare&#39;s time, his birthplace, New Place Gardens, where the foundations of his later home are now shown and in the garden are still grown many of the poet&#39;s favourite flowers; the New Place Museum; Anne Hathaway&#39;s Cottage. two miles distant from Stratford in the pretty little village of Shottery; the Memorial Theatre. picturesquely situated on the bank of the Avon. beautiful and crowded with treasures.&nbsp; All this sight-seeing occupied us from 9 a.m. until tea time, and at the Inn we entertained quite a number of local gentry and personages besides three little Yankee girls touring as entertainers to the troops.&nbsp; Sir Frank Benson was there and &quot;did his piece&quot;; a lovely girl from the London stage sang a simple song &quot;Robin Adair&quot; with marvellous expression and beauty, which gave the song a new status, she also gave two encores.&nbsp; The Yankee violiniste was a treat<s>e</s>, she played good music in a splendid way and wearied not of many encores. while the &quot;Yank&quot; reciter lady kept us &quot;sniggling&quot; through all her monologues.&nbsp; Then of course the usual Interval for &quot;Chin Music&quot; when we said &quot;Nice Day</p>
